2,Thoroughly pretentious...,"The Booker Prize Committee got hoodwinked. A writing style entirely lacking in subtlety and full of bad metaphors (one character compares her step-mother to a barge...); far-fetched plot divices; self-absorbed, unlikeable characters with no voices of their own (they all speak like the poet Ondaatje). Now I know why I disliked the movie so much..."
1,Homework,"If your are smart, don't read the book, there are enough reviews on the internet to use if you have to write a bookreview for your English teacher."
2,problems,"I got this book for 25 cents in my library's basement and all I can say is I'm glad I didn't have to pay the retail price for it.There isn't much I can say other than that the language gets in the way of the ""story"". Heck, I couldn't even find the story at times. I hate pretentious books and all the hype surround thing one just makes it worse. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the wording could be quite beautiful. Just not my kind of book."
5,let's compare it to the movie real fast,"There are two couples in the movie. In one, the woman is a dead witch, and the man is in a bed lying very still. In the other, the woman is a nurse whose boyfriends tend to die, and the other DEFUSES BOMBS!!!Which couple do you find more interesting? The movie focuses on the dead witch and the man lying in bed. The book gives them space, but focuses more on the other two lovers. You know, the ones who we care about a whole lot more and whose jobs are real interesting.Oh, and in case you haven't heard, Ondaatje is a weaver of words unchallenged in North America. Maybe South American authors (mostly dead) can give him a run for his Booker, but they aren't in the commonwealth, are they? This text is a gorgeous jewel. Check this one out and avoid that awful, boring, tedious, cowardly film. My theory on that unfortunate Oscar, everyone wanted to give this book the Oscar so they had to give it to the director of the movie.Peace out, and word to your mother."
1,What a talent.,"Wow. 300 pages of nothing. This book is certainly amazing. Everyone tells me the style of this book is breathtaking. Yea, it truly is. He has absolutely no writing ability whatsoever. The ""imagery"" and ""description"" that everyone rants about is pointless, boring, uninteresting, and rambling. There is zero structure to the novel, and to add insult to injury, this hapless book doesn't even lead you to anything. There's no plot. It's just a winding nonsense festival of shallow observations and condescending themes. If you would happen to like a book about 4 people living in a random villa TALKING for 300 pages, you'd love this book. For all others, avoid this book like the plague."
4,I liked the movie better.,"The book is certainly very good, but the movie is stunning.By focusing on the love story, certainly the movie losessome of the depth of the original (see the review that givesthe book a ""5""), but it more than makes up for it in beautyand clarity. The visuals brought home the beauty of thevision far better for me than the book, and I wasn'tdistracted by the hunt for Almasy's identity the way I wasreading the book. But, oddly enough, it is the differencesbetween the two that, for me, fill in the gaps between thetwo most clearly. It's as if I understand the story, thecomplex ineffable ""point"", better by the rearrangement of the scenesinto the film."
1,boring and irritating,"I guess these are the books the jury likes for awards. I was looking for a good lively love story, but ended up reading one of the most complicated and dragging novel of all time.There is no begining or ending and the lives in the book have no meaning. a boring and dissappointing saga of a burnt patient and the nurses love for him or who, i could not understand.My worst read so far"
2,Watch the movie,"While I loved the movie, the book left me dry and perplexed. Normally I prefer the book to the movie, but in this case, it was the other way around. The story jumps around a great deal and you live in the heads of Hana, Caravagio and Kip, but only graze upon those of Catherine and Almasy. If you expect to read about that great romance, better just rent the video because it's not in the book."
2,Flat,"A lyrically written book, with I feel, no great substance (and not much humour either). The characters (four of them) are not very convincing. How this book could be compared to `All Quiet on the Western Front' is beyond me as they are entirely different stories (this was cited in one of the comments in my edition). The author skips endlessly from one time sequence to another time sequence - as if he cannot hold a thought for more than a few pages. This out of sequence style strikes me as contrived. There are nice sentences thrown together but little cohesion.At the end the author lists his sources. It is as if he read the sources and used these to try to inspire a novel - about deserts and dismantling bombs."
4,English Patient,"The English Patient is by far one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The words are so generous and descriptive, each page was an adventure into the lives of the characters, and every work delicious. I have not read any other books by Michael Ondaatje, but I will certainly be looking for others.I would recommend this book to anybody who can appreciate good literature, not to the lover of the Mills and Boon type book."
1,A Major Disappointment!,"I am a lover of books and enjoy nothing more thana ""good read."" I was looking forward to readingthis book prior to seeing the movie, and anticipated an ""all-nighter"" staying up until the book was finished. It is a small book, after all. I was SO disappointed to find it a boring, ponderous artsy-fartsy book which relies on stream of consciousness and endless narrative to tell an uninteresting story. There are very few books I find unable to finish, but I have put this down three or four times to read another book instead. Although I keep coming back to it to try to press onward to see what all the fuss is about, I find myself caring less and less. The characters are shallow and pretentious, and could use more development; the plot(s) entwine and separate but never engage the reader. Thumbs down!!"
4,I prefered the picture....,"I read the book after watching the pictures, which may be a mistake. The book is a bit hard to read, and it's hard to follow its thread. While reading, you can'i imagine the magnificent feelings, love and light wrapping the film. A bit disappointing."
3,The English Patient is inspired but erratic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and its beautifully told intertwining stories. Nonetheless, it does appears to be several stories loosely linked into a central narrative. Each of the stories is suberbly crafted and the writing is exceptional. But at times, I could not see the overall theme of the writer and where he thought it all fitted.It is almost like several short stories mixed together and then placing the characters togther at the end of the war as they sort out their lives.Despite this weakness, I loved the description of the desert and the trips through the wilderness. The love story is imaginatively told and the bomb decommissioning scenes are harrowing."
3,GOOD between 3.5 and 4 stars,I liked this book much better than the boring movie. It was beautifully written but some parts flashed back and the ending was weird but the story was lovely about 4 lives during the war and you got into some of the characters lives. His style of writing in this book and the story was much better than Anil's Ghost which I found to be boring and redundant. A good book. I've read better but I've also read much worse.
3,Do yourself a favor--use mind altering drugs to prepare,"Strange and boring. Difficult. Rambling. At the end, you will have decided it wasn't worth the effort. Dry, tasteless, cheerless. If you want to give it a try--acquire it at the library. (That way you won't feel bad when you quit after a hundred pages.) The movie--one of the most beautifully photographed awful films of all time. Like a really bad Lawrence of Arabia. Best advice: pass on anything labeled ""The English Patient."""
2,Guaranteed success,"An excellent example of a book written with an audience in mind. Contains all the right trappings for appeal to the modern upwardly mobile. Oh! yes, how strange, the book has also been made into an award winning movie. Full of punishing, flowery and mostly inappropriate prose. This book proves, once again, that the best literary efforts don't win awards"
2,Difficult Read,"I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed."
2,Don't buy the audio version,"I have amassed a rich collection of audio books and this is by far the worst. I bought it several years ago, started listening to it, and stopped halfway through. I just couldn't get into it. Recently, I tried to listen to it again, thinking maybe I missed something the first time around. It was just as bad. Whereas, with most audio books, the narration adds to the content of the book, in this one, it kills it. If you want to read this book, stick to the paperback version."
2,Pretentious book with unintelligible plotline.,"While acknowledging that the prose is flowery, I much prefer direct novels with something to say. The film made some sense of it all. If you liked this book, you will like Possession, another Booker Prize winner. I say the co-winner of the Booker for this particular year was much better."
5,The best book of the last 25 years,"I haven't read anything better. To dwell on the historical inaccuracies is to miss the point (I'm something of an amateur military historian, but I was enjoying everything too much to let them ruffle my feathers). The writing is beautiful, lyrical and evocative. I spent several months reading and re-reading it, enjoying the imagry and the characters. The only problem is the ending, which is both abrupt and seemingly somewhat at odds with the rest of the narrative. Kip is a relatively minor character for most of the novel, and it is a mistake to center the ending on him. Fortunately the movie, which is excellent, avoids this faux pas. That aside, I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,A novel that is pure poetry,"What can i say? This book is like reading the most beautiful poem you can imagine. The English Patient transports you into different worlds- let's you experience feelings and sensations that would be impossible to find on your own. You will never look at things the same after you read this. It's plot is one of mystery, passion and life."
5,A blanket of emotions that covers you in feeling,There are some fictional works that can tell more truths than any non fiction book could ever come close to examining. The English Patient is one of those novels. The relationships developed between the characters are so cleverly done that they show the sometimes painful truth about living. While the love story between Katherine and The Count takes a lesser role in the book than the movie the author creates a love that hurts us because even though it is forbidden it is beautiful when it happens All in all the dialouges between the lives of the characters past and present lead to an unforgettable tale that is fated to move readers just like the characters with the rawness of pure emotion
3,ok,"these speakers are ok, but rank below my 17-year-old jbl's..the polk's are a bit tinny .but OK..i was able to move my old jbl's to the media room and gave my wife the new polks"
2,Space between grill and speaker too big,"Had a pair and was satisfied with the sound for several months. I noticed the sound was off and when I pulled the speaker grill, a bottle cap had cut the tweeter. Apparently the magnet sucked the cap up between the grill and the speaker (there is an inch of open space) and the cap cut the speaker. I have found that debris will also be introduced from the gap in the top.Big Design Flaw. Not for use on a bookshelf. Wall Mount Only!"
4,"Decent sound, good quality","I got these as a compromise with the wife who thought the Monitor 40's were too large. I'm not what you would consider an audiophile but the sound seems pretty good. I didn't like the keyhole mounting option so I ordered a pair of Omnimount 20 Wall mounts but had to rig the mounting plate with washers because of where the flange for the connectors was and didn't want to drill new holes. It would have been nice if Polk had provided threaded inserts for mounting. However, the rigged up speaker mounts seem to be holding. Excellent build quality and clear highs."
4,Good for small rooms or rear surround,"I made the mistake of thinking that these speakers could be used as front channel speakers with a sub (Polk PSW 12) so as to look nice on either side of my new flat screen TV. While they looked great, the sound was truly lacking. If all you want is home theater sound and you don't do very much listening to 2 channel music, then these are fine. For music playback, I found them to sound ""boxy"" and lack mid-bass even with a sub.Polk makes a great speaker and for a small room or rear surround these are probably perfect, I just couldn't make them work for my application. I have a pair of Monitor 40s now and they are just right."
2,Bass Heavy Sound,"I like the small size of these speakers, but the designers weighted the sound too heavy in the lower-midrange and bass. The result is somewhat muddy. I would love to know of a similarly-sized speaker with better balanced performance."
5,Excellent Sound For the $,"Needed a pair of decent bookshelf speakers for my office at work. Wanted to get away from the sat/sub PC-speakers I had. Had an old Carver preamp & power amp pair taking up space on my basement shelf. I got these M30's for $120 on amazon. I really didn't expect much at this price. They just needed to sound marginally better than the PC-speakers. I was wrong. The combo of a solid,warm,robust sounding amplification setup paired with these Polks really does the job. I'm scratching my head trying to figure out why I paid $2k for my home speakers when these little guys put such a smile on my face. These are for my office at work so I need to be careful about playing them too loud but towards the end of the day I can let loose a bit with anything from 80s Metallica to Daftpunk. It all sounds great."
5,Huge and Powerful,"These are some huge bookshelf speakers. Initially I thought I was going dislike the size of the speakers, but after I heard them work, I was converted. They are certainly bigger than most bookshelf speakers I looked into, but the sound and the price was well worth it."
4,Gift item,I bought these speakers as a gift for my brother at christmas. He said they are working out great. Easy to work with seller. Plentiful communication and very professional.
3,"Not bad for the price, but only recommended if space is an issue.","I bought these speakers to compliment a new flat-panel TV in our living room, I chose the Monitor 30's because of their compact size along with Polk's good reputation for sound quality. They are fine little speakers, but are noticeably lacking in mid-range sound, even when accompanied by a sub (they are currently hooked up with a Polk PSW-10 sub). They offer great highs and the sub combination obviously supplies plenty of bass, but the lack of mids is distracting. My Athena AS-B2's sound WORLDS better and can be had for the same price elsewhere online. The Athenas are larger than the Polks but the sound is much, much richer and more versatile overall. Bottom line, the Monitor 30's are decent if you can find a good deal and if you need to save space."
4,A great deal,"I hooked these speakers up to a 20+ year old NAD amplifier that delivers 20W per channel. This is at the bottom of the recommended power range, but the sound is excellent and is everything that I could have hoped for. They take up very little room and look good too. I am very satisfied and would buy them again."
5,Great anti-fungal shampoo,"My dachshund suffers from chronic yeast allergies/infections. Not only does this shampoo help with itching, it smells great and keeps her coat soft and smooth. A great product that's reasonably priced."
3,dog cleanser,This shampoo works ok. It cleaned my dog but did not help her skin condition which is why I purchased it.
4,Smells great!,"I was a big fan of malaseb but since it's no longer for sale I switched to this one. My cocker smells nice and his coat is beautiful so thus far I'm pleased. He still itches and it seems a bit more than with malaseb, but hey it's better than other brands."
4,Great Product!,I purchased this product because my 4 year old Corgi had an itchy rash that came on suddenly. I began washing him weekly with this shampoo and the rash cleared right up.
5,Best for sensitive skin dogs.,"My dog has seasonal allergies and has had a whole host of fungal and bacterial infections on his skin every 6 months or so despite being on vet recommended medicated shampoos and even cortisol afterbath lotions and more. I finally decided to just stop all the chemicals - antibiotics, sprays, medicated shampoos, leave in lotions... all of it. Switched to zymox enzymatic shampoo and have not had one skin issue in 3 years. Vets seem to have not figured out (or are getting kick backs for not telling you) that all these chemicals and drugs are bad for dogs. Period. Don't even get me started on flea solutions or food. Just buy this. Don't wait until your dog has skin problems. You will be happy. Great product."
3,Works - kinda,My dog has a skin problem. It does help the day of washing but a day or two later its back. I was hoping since its enzymaic the effect would last longer
4,"Fun Toy, Great Price",It's always a pleasure when my daughter can fell and touch her favorite cartoon characters.
1,"This filter is not equal to original factory installed toyota, my 2007","This filter is not equal to original factory installed toyota, my 2007 Camry xle 3.5l V6 had a thicker filter and charcoal, this filter is a less sophisticated version than the original, for vehicles 2005 and 2006 Toyota Avalon, but it serves its components is not are of the quality and technology of the original. If you want quality buy the original toyota. I for one do not buy more"
2,not equal to OEM,This filters has way less folds than the oem filter that was in my truck. Probably way less filtering ability. Not worth the money.
1,Where's the beef?,"The amount of useful material in this book is minimal. Most of the book, almost 600 pages, is a listing of State Medicaid offices throughout the country."
1,How did this ever reach the screen?,"The entire series is very bad. Since I'm a SciFi junkie, its got to be pretty bad before I'd knock it. If people watch this and think it is good, then they'd watch anything."
5,Powerful,"I stumbled across this graphic novel in a used bookstore, not having any idea the impression it would make on me. This is an incredibly powerful story, very effectively told through the medium of comic art. It is an affirmation of the power of visual media, and an example of how comics can be used for much more than funnies and fantasies. It is also probably the most effective anti-nuclear material I have ever come across."
5,The greatest parody ever!,"Hi, I'm a thirteen year old Trekkie, and I want to let everyone know that this was the best 'episode' I've seen! It plays off every Trek joke in the book, and the animation is the best! If you love Star Trek enough to enjoy seeing it made fun of, you will LOVE this video!"
3,Beautiful but lacking info on content,I purchased this album based on the samples given. We use music to sing to during our service. I was looking for a good copy of Joyful Joyful we adore thee. After buying the album I discovered that the song is acutally a complation of several songs. While beautiful it is not what I wasw hoping for. I think that in the description this should be mentioned as a medley.
5,YES,I LOVE these christian comps. because they let you get the feel of christian music. It's not all gospel!
2,Peter Pan Syndrome book,"This book is hard to find, but I was disappointed about the condition. It said excellent condition, and it came and it was much dirtier and handled than described."
4,The peter Pan Syndrome,I can't get thet people that need this information to read it. The title tells them what they are. OOOPs
1,Garbage.,"This book can help no one. Just a book of men sharing intimate, vulgar, sexual details with other men, the two stimulating each other erotically during the talk while wearing poker faces, and at the same time ""proving themselves learned and liberated.""If you need help with this Syndrome read ""peace of soul"", by F.J. Sheen. There is a start."
5,Ortega was a true sage,"Of any of the political texts that I have read, none comes closer to predicting what the future would be. Written in the early part of the century, Ortega presents what are (will be) the failings of mass government. From the coming of war to the prevalence of the ""self-satisfied"" man, the author tells of a grim future for mankind."
3,Look for two attitudes,"Having been outvoted on any major issue that I would like to address, I feel that I have been the victim of mass man as a political phenomenon as much as anyone has. The book ends with a real question, but to keep the book short, no effort is made to solve the problem which remains to plague thinkers after all these years. Ending up with this wisdom is about like finding something by Nietzsche about an animal crawling off by itself to be alone when it dies."
5,A Good Book.,"While Ortega Y Gasset is somewhat inaccurate about Fascism (as it applied to Italy and German National Socialism -- not Spanish), it nonetheless is a compelling book that drops a hard kick in the crotch of all ""Demo-Fraud"" lovers like 99.9% of our ""loved"" politicians and 95% of the human estate. A good book, if you want to know why you're a sheep, just like everyone else!"
1,Go with Ferri or the Wash Manual Instead,"Some of these reviews look suspicously from the author himself. A little too glowing to be realistic. This book doesn't offer what's been offered time and time again. Too many people trying to cash in on the fears of young medical students. The best book out there is by Ferri, followed by the Wash Manual. Don't waste your money or time on anything else."
1,Don't Pay Money for Someone's Notebook,"Yet, another person who's taken his school notes, typed them up, and charges money for them. The print is too small. The information is often disjointed. If the editor (a loose term at that) wants to do us a favor, charge less and add a little structure."
1,Exploiting Medical Students and Residents,Yet another book that gouges poor medical students and residents for money.
4,Study results!,"I see a lot of both good and poor reviews for this book. Personally, I like the book a lot. What it has that Ferri's doesn't is evidence-based medicine. Several major studies (PIOPED, and the like) are summarized. Yes, it is someone's notebook in fancy form. But it's cheap, it's small, and it's good. I found that it was too light on details when I was starting out, but once I felt a little more comfortable with my ability to come up with a basic differential, this was the book for me. It was great help for those long medicine write-ups, providing clinical research correlations. Now it is the only book that I carry in my pocket, full of micrographic notes that I have made from lectures, other books, etc. Ferri's isn't exactly pocket-friendly."
2,What happened?,"...This album is a very, very far cry from the noisy, nine track wonder Wisdom, which is by far my favorite by Eric Powell. It doesn't even come close to matching up with supercoolnothing, Demography or Skin. The riffs are boring and the lyrics are awful. Eric has succeeded in stripping away everything that I liked about his other CD's. Plus, I can honestly find something extremely annoying in every song, except A Cloth Like Gauze. This is the CD's only redeeming song that I could find. So save your money and buy any of the CD's I mentioned here with the exception of Letdowncrush. If you are a huge 16 Volt fan, then pick this up. Maybe you'll like it more than I did..."
4,Great Architectural History,This book is a wonderful history/architectural reference. I purchased this book as an interior design reference and although it does not cover interior design details the rich history provided by the author led me to want to read this book cover to cover. And what a beautiful cover it is- brown leather- makes this a great coffee table book. This would be a great gift for anyone interested in western architecture and home style. This is not one of those books that choses a certain western style and displays hundred of the same photograph-this book covers every ranch style possible. I will continue to reference this book for inspiration and ideas.
4,a stirring rendition,"Karajan's orchestration is dynamic and stirring. This recording is worth having for Agnes Baltsa's hair raising, intense portrait of Amneris. She is fantastic! Mirella Freni just a bit weak and works well with Carreras, but Baltsa steals the show."
3,Aida Lite,"While Herbert von Karajan conducts with his usual ear to detail (the brass in particular is stunning), his soloists are not quite up to their roles. Mirella Freni began adopting dramatic roles later in her career but her's was always basically a lyric soprano. She never possessed the lower register of a Milanov or Price and thus sounds hysterical when she should be tragic. Many tenors strain trying to scale the heights of ""Celeste Aida"" and Jose Carreras is no exception. He also possessed a voice much lighter than usual for Radames and seems extremely uncomfortable with the music. Agnes Baltsa is able to bring Amneris to life although she is no Verdi mezzo. Fortunately, there IS a Verdi baritone - the excellent Piero Cappuccilli. For the price, one would do much better with one of the older recordings - Solti, Perlea or even von Karajan's earlier recording."
2,Good but flimsy,"I was happy with the features and screen of this PDA, although its plastic construction felt flimsy compared to my old Palm V. Unfortunately, I have had to return this CLIE for repair/replacement. The innards of the memory stick slot broke loose. SONY warranty service answered my call promptly, and quickly sent me a pre-addressed FedEx carton for return of the unit."
4,Excellent PDA,"This is my fourth PDA - the first in color. The display quality for text, photos and games is exceptional. Excellent MP3 player as well. I agree with the complaints about short battery life. With black and white PDAs you don't really need the backlight, so batteries last a while. With this one, unless you are in outstanding light, you need the backlight and that drains the battery pretty quickly.Also, the separate hotsync cable and power cable share an adapter. This sounds like no big deal, but it is unnecessarily inconvenient."
5,The Best Bang for the Buck,"First the bad. Yes, you need a memory stick, but that makes sense because it only has 16MB ram. It ships with half of the memory allready used up, so you'll want to do a little spring cleaning to free up some RAM. And its only OS 4.1.Now the good. I upgraded from a Handspring Visor Deluxe. What a sweet little package this Clie is! Its fast, convenient, powerful and, oh yea, plays MP3's. The display is great. Stores wonderful pictures in high resolution. My games look great, though all I play is Text Twist. Finally customer support was supurb. I got through in about 10 minutes and my problem was easily resolved...."
2,Problems with MP3's,"I've had the SJ33 for about two weeks. Overall I have to agree with other reviews regarding the screen -- it is the most impressive feature of the SJ33. However, my experience with the clie has been very frustrating. I purchased it primarily as a way to have an MP3 player together with my organizer. As of this writing despite several exchanges with sony tech support I've been unable to get the MP3 player to work with any of my existing MP3s all of which play without problem on my other MP3 players, It appears that this issue will not be resolved and I'll have to return the SJ33 at this point."
4,Blast from the Past,Only bought this unit for a collection I have of Old school PDA's. Everything working well just not syncing with my laptop since it's Windows 7
2,deceptive advertising,"ocarina was ordered, even though said blue tambourine; followed with double checking item and figured the supplier was called blue tambourine. What a surprise. I see I wasn't the only person that ordered the ocarina and received the tambourine."
1,Fix your listing!,I thought I was ordering Ocarinas and received a tambourine. I see now that I am not the only customer who has had this problem. Maybe it's time you fix your listing...? Get it right!
1,Seriously?,"I THOUGHT I was ordering two ocarinas. This DID show up when I searched ""ocarina."" I did, however, find it a little odd that the title said ""Tambourine, Blue."" I thought, perhaps, tambourine was an almost mauve shade of red, and not the useless noise-maker some percussionists use. I thought, since these looked like almost exact replicas from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, they must be just that. THIS COMPANY DOESN'T EVEN SELL OCARINAS. To improve this product, I recommend that the name be changed to: ""Ocarinas, Red and Blue"" and that the product be changed to contain a red ocarina and a blue ocarina, as pictured. However, if you need a Tambourine of the blue variety, I suppose this would not be a poor choice."
5,A Novel Turn for a Children's Classic,"As a teacher of reading and writing, I've discovered a very popular lesson among students of all ages: write a known story from a different point of view. The protagonist of this children's book is The Traitor, Edmund, but it is a different Edmund than the one we're used to, a different one from the one portrayed in the recently-released film. Edmund has always been an easy target for castigation, but this literary rendition beautifully illustrates the teaching that we should not be so quick to judge. Perhaps this rendition prepares our path to forgiveness -- a path that C.S. Lewis tried to forge."
2,One big rehash,"Do not read if you've read The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe! This is just Edmund's point of view of it (as the title proves)."
3,A Trip to the Past,"There are two reasons to buy this CD. The first, of course, is Burning Bridges, the great song from the movie Kelly's Heroes. That song alone is worth the price of the disc. The second reason to buy is the flood of memories that some of these songs will stir up in those listeners old enough to remember early '70s easy listening radio. Hearing Sweet Gingerbread Man, for example, made me feel like I was playing with toys near my Grandma's stereo nearly 40 years ago. The songs on this disc have pretty much been forgotten by contemporary radio and that makes their ability to take the listener into the past that much more powerful.Be warned though, some of these songs are pretty sappy while others are almost unbearably corny. This would be primarliy a sentimental purchase but Burning Bridges stands up to popular music from any era."
5,just what I was looking for,"I was looking for the song ""A Daisy a day: by Jed Strunk - this was the only cassette I could find so was very happy."
3,nutritional facts,make sure you look at the nutrition facts before you order.i would not have ordered if i knew each serving contained16 grams of sugar. that means each 9.9oz container has over5oz of sugar? please correct me if i am missing somethingwith my calculation.
2,tastes horrible!,"these capsules taste pretty awful, blood looks realistic thoughI wouldn't buy them again since they taste HORRIBLE, and at 25 cents per capsule they're not a bargain."
4,So interesting!,Such an interesting read! If you're interested in true crime or criminal profiling this is for you.A great read if you're into the methods and workings of the FBI. Very easy reading!
4,Goof FBI book.,This is a great book gives you an eye on the inside of one of the FBI creators for the Behavioral Science Unit.
4,Disturbingly Gruesome,"I found John Douglas's story about himself and his work to be very engaging. He is a funny man and that is a good thing in his line of work.I found it fascinating that he has developed this profiling science that has helped with many, many cases involving murder.It's just that I couldn't finish the book. Though very well written, this book is very, very disturbing and gruesome. Half way through, I just could not bear to hear of one more life torturously and needlessly snuffed out. I am thankful for people like John Douglas and for the work they do, I just can't read the details of it."
3,Fairy Keychain,A bit thinner than I thought it would be but probably necessary in order to keep it from being too heavy.
5,mood music,"hungry ghosts are an australian trio that plays instrumental music on a variety of instruments. they mine some of the same territory as their contrymen, the dirty three, although the hungry ghosts' approach is a little more varied. hungry ghosts are less cathartic than the dirty three, and more soporific, but in a good way. the music meanders and drifts pleasantly through soundscapes that make you glad to be at home on a rainy day. this music is ambient in the original brian eno sense of the word, it seemlessly sinks into the background, yet is at the same time utterly engaging; you can pay attention to it as easily and joyously as you can ignore it. definately recommended..."
3,Ricky's Unplugged,"Being a fan of Ricky Martin, I would've thought this would've been longer with a lot more songs despite the fact it's in Spanish.But overall, it's still ok."
3,Ricky is great but there's NO SUBTITLES !!!,"Box says: Subtitulos en Ingles, Espanol, Portugues, Italiano, Aleman & Frances. But there are NO SUBTITLES at all, as a few other reviewers have mentioned. The fact that Ricky is great makes the lack of subtitles even more frustrating. So unless you speak Spanish, be forewarned."
5,great voice,"amazing songs and voice, shut the light down low and enjoy beautiful songs with someone you love be it child, adult or pet dove!"
1,Ricky Martin Unplugged,I returned this product to you as it was all in Spainish. It wasn't asvertized as so. All other purchases I've made from you get 5 Stars! I'm a very satisfied customer.
3,Stage Musical Score Only,"This is a nice ""Little Nemo"" piece of Americana to add to your collection, but be aware that this is a reproduction of the original music score for the Little Nemo stage musical that was performed in New York around 1908. The book does not contain illustrations."
5,My kids love this!,"I was actually on the computer trying to find a sequel to this ""book."" There are one hundred questions or other thought-provokers in this little spiral bound tome and we are almost to the end. Eeek! This book has become part of our bedtime routine and the kids (8 and 10) never forget it. Unlike brushing their teeth and picking out clothes for the next day, they always enjoy this part of our night. It's fun for their dad and me, too."
5,Surprisingly Good,Surpisingly good for a book of only about 100 pages. It covers the basics as well as going into detail about the important varietals one needs to know. There were details about ordering at restaurants that I have not seen in books three times the length. Hardly any others have had a how-to on visiting a vineyard and this one was very good. Nice non-intimidating book.
4,Galician piper,"Very enjoyable (knew his playing from the Chieftain's ""Santiago"") with an interesting mix of musicians on board."
3,"Technically excellent, but a hodgepodge of artists","Carlos Nunez is a tremendously talented piper, but the Chieftains appear to have left him with the idea that more is better when it comes to loading an album with as many musical collaborators as possible. ""Os Amores Libres"" takes this to the point of overkill, with over 75 musicians on just 12 tracks. Some of the choices left me scratching my head. Having Jackson Browne singing here is stretching it, in my view. With dozens of artists this CD ends up sounding like a hodgepodge by the end, and it's easy to lose track of Carlos himself. This album is technically very well executed, but there's little feel or spontaneity. It's not that I don't like it - the first half is really quite good - but there are just way too many players on this CD and not all of them fit in. This would have been a much better album if Carlos had kept his collaborators to a reasonable number and let his own talent shine through."
3,Carlos enlightens,As a fellow Galician piper myself I must admit that Carlos is one of the best. I met him in person once not knowing who he was at the time. I feel that he does a lot of exploration contrary to the other reviews. If people were familiar with Galician music they would see he does do different things. I am glad he is making it in the world and hopefully he will do great. His third album not listed here is great too.
3,Una decepción,"Cuando uno ha podido escuchar ""Hermandad de las Estrellas"" uno se queda maravillado ante la calidad interpretativa del artista; sin embargo, esta segunda producción deja mucho que desear. Carlos utiliza la gaita en sólo dos canciones, lo cual nos indica como van las cosas, las canciones son poco profundas y por querer abarcar mucho (demasiados ritmos) aprieta poco, y nos brinda con un mal sabor en la boca y con un disco mediocre para lo que nos tiene acostumbrados Carlos Nuñez. Una gran oportunidad perdida."
4,classic,this is one of those classic disney cartoons that never die for a good reason. Unfortunatly it never became a feature because it was too short. It is still very imaginative and entertaining
4,Works well,"This works well for its designed purpose. I found the set of different-sized trimming heads to be good, though the most useful is the one that looks like a very aggressive toothbrush. The shaver can only handle relaly short hairs as left behind by the trimming heads, so you end up having to use both. It doesn't catch skin in the trimmer blades unless you're exceptionally hamfisted, unlike some other hair trimmers where it is common. It deals pretty well with long hair, though not so well with curly hair since it trims to an absolute height above the skin - it can take several tries to deal with them."
3,useful product,"This seems to be a product designed more for women, but there are components I use, for example, I trim sideburns, ear and nose hairs. I purchased it on a promotion and the ""price was right""."
2,Overly Simplified,"I have QuickBooks, Now What? I'll tell you what, don't buy this book. I understand that this book is written for self-employed, small business owners who know next to nothing about bookkeeping, but it's way too dumbed down. I am a small business owner who knows nothing about bookkeeping; that's why I bought the book. But I didn't get anything useful out of it. It's literally written for people with an 8th grade education. I learned next to nothing from the book. As a business owner, I want to know why things need to be done a certain way. This book just gives you the simplest case examples with no explanation, but plenty of useless fluff. So I couldn't figure out what to do in my particular situation. And every business owner is going to have a unique situation. Find a better book that has some more detail and can give you some insight. If you want to learn about bookkeeping and why things are done the way they are, don't buy this book."
5,This cd blows me away!,"I love everything about this cd, Miyavi's talent for making catchy music is imminent here, and yet at the same time there'll be tracks that just make you want to headbang and jump into a mosh...this cd has been played in my car over and over, and yet I NEVER tire of it. I highly recommend this cd for anyone who loves good, hard rock with some catchy tunes in between. There's not a song on there that you won't like, even if you don't speak japanese."
5,The album speaks for itself,"Read the other reviewer's comments...they aren't making this stuff up. If you're taking a chance on some j-rock on a recommendation, then you're in the place to be. There is NOTHING about this album that will disappoint you. It's electric, high energy, and backed by VERY skillful guitar playing. Miyavi has earned a reputation for knowing his way around a guitar. When you hear this album, you will understand why.Get this. Enjoy."
3,Miyavism,"This cd is probably one of the miyavi cds I only listen to a few songs on. This cd is different from a lot of his other cds and if this is the first cd of Miyavi you are thinking of getting, I would probably tell you to go with a different one until you work your way up. If you like more heavy rock, this is the cd for you!"
3,How did TROMA get their hands on this?,"The phrase ""Respect for your elders"" comes into full effect as a group of friends try to fix up a real estate agent's worst nightmare but find their having some difficulty doing so with a killer granny mutilating them. For destroying her tombstone, no less. Do not trust the title nor the video box, neither are correct in describing the teens who do a MUCH better job of acting once their dead. Owes a little something in credit to THE EVIL DEAD series, which this tops, easily. Don't watch alone!"
3,"good, with some minor flaws","I like this book, let me just say that. And everyone else seems to love this book. But to get real, I found this book to have too many pictures of what close ups you can shoot, and almost no pictures of the equipment she describes using, or of the positions people used to make the photos. And too much descriptive writing accompanying each photo. A bit too wordy for my taste, but I was able to take notes of the actual technical information that I was after which seems adequate for my needs. Yes buy the book for the info in it, it's good from that perspective."
3,I'm about ready to pop the thing,"Inflatable pools are supposed to be convenient-- they're supposed to be able to be inflated and deflated easily so you don't have to leave them out all year long, right? Well, after 45 minutes of pressing on it, squeezing it, kneeling on it, lying across it... I'm about ready to pop this whale. It's still half-inflated.Aside from that... it's cute. I didn't have issues with leaks (we had it out for about 2 months this summer, though only used it twice). The tail does limit the space somewhat with older kids because it gets in the way, but no problem for young ones. There is no ""padding"" on the bottom, so if someone falls, it's a hard fall.I wouldn't buy it again sheerly because of the pain in the butt of inflating and deflating it, but other than that, it's fine."
2,Don't buy a blow up,"We threw this one away and got a kiddie pool that does not blow up. We like it much better. After using the whale just a few times, we got several leaks and had to patch it up. Finally, we got tired of the air leaking out and the tail falling over into the pool so we just threw it away. I would have sent it back but it's not worth the trouble for it's price."
5,Durable fun pool,"We had to borrow a tool to inflate the pool from a neighbor, but once it was inflated, it stayed inflated very well, and was fairly big. The sprayer tail was very cool, but a little intimidating for the kids to get in, but they liked to watch the tail spray."
3,"It's cute, but won't last","The stinky pvc used to make this super cute pool is thin and only lasted 1 use. The tail is kinda annoying, but if it's properly inflated it will not flop over into the pool as others have complained.My 1 year old really liked this pool and enjoyed the spray feature. If the product could be made with a more durable material that hasn't been proven by the state of california to cause cancer, it would be worth replacing.At this point, I think I'll but a molded plastic pool instead."
4,Works fine.,"We bought this pool in 2007. We have not had any problems with leaks (air or water) or the tail flopping over. We bought the Intex air pump (cheap, but effective) to inflate the pool."
3,A whale of a flop,"Tail keeps flopping into the pool, taking up most of the space for wading. It is very annoying. I wouldn't get this again. Looks cute, overall. Seems durable - we've had it up for two months now."
5,Graceful and emotive,"I loved this CD so much I bought one for a friend. He loves it too. In the over-hyped USA music market, it is refreshing to find this unique cd to enjoy over and over again."
4,Good album for anyone but has some problems!,"I will start this will saying 2 things you may be wondering from the title. I think that people probably would think that this is for little boys/girls who like disney stuff! This is a great album for Dance pop fans everywhere.This is the second thing! Its says this is supposed to include 3 new songs. Out of the ones listed, only 1 is on it and its the ""Be Good To Me"" remix! The Songs ""Who I AM"" and ""It's Life"" are not on this. I don't know if this is the same for everyone but it happened to me and I'm not to happy about it! I suggest get the regular version because you will get all of the good tracks! ThAnK$ fOr ReAdInG!"
2,Headstrong? more like HEADache,"as i love high school musical, i decided that i would give this cd a try, i thought it would be like vanessa hudgens debut album, when i got it i put it in my cd play. it was then i realised that ashley tisdale has NO vocal talent,and sounds like shes just swallowed hilium. every song on the cd is supperficial shallow, and extremely easy to sing. in most of the songs se doesnt reach the higer notes and in others u can hear her breathing. this was a complete waste of money,and since i am in the tween age group i can tell everyone how appaling this cd is. if you want a cd from an amazingly talented singer go and buy vanessa hudgensV"
1,wow this sucks really bad,"ashley tisdale can hardly be called a musician. she didn't write any of the songs on this cd, and her voice sounds like my five year old sister...not a good thing. the worst song is 'unlove you.' her voice sounds terrible like she has a massive head cold. these songs have no meaning whatsoever. i know people that can sing better than her and where's their record deal? come on disney channel keep these pop star wannabees to yourself and not share them with the rest of the world.if you want someone that can actually sing AND write their own songs (who knew that was possible ashley?) check out flyleaf, barlowgirl, evanesence, and fireflight. stay away from this disney crap.btw i'm 14 i don't know why it says kids review"
1,Headstrong or Tone Deaf?,"Wow...listening to Ashley is about as apealing as listening to someone drag their nails across a chalk board, in other words it hurts alot!I heard her singing Last Christmas, and she absolutely killed the song. There is a reason that Disney chose Miss Tisdale to play a person who couldn't sing but over performed in Highschool Musical! Ashley cannot and I repeat CANNOT sing! She can barely talk! She's irritating, and her acting is horrible except in Suite Life, which is the only place I like her.I think that this album should be immediantly put in the garbage disposal...hey atleast the grinding noise will sound better then her.Michelle"
1,Bad Singing!,"Wow! when I listen to this cd for the first time I was really disappointed!!! Ashley cannot sing! It seems like the music overpowers her voice! 1 or 2 of the songs were okay, the rest was not worth the money I spent! I definately would recommend Vanessa Hudgens or Corbin Bleu over this cd! I'm selling this cd right back on Amazon! Any takers?"
4,"The ""explicit"" He Said She Said is in here","I was worrying whether there would be pressure from Disney to pull the explicit version of ""He Said She Said"" from the album, and when iTunes came out with the edited, kiddie, teeny version I was getting alarmed. Could this awesome version just be a bootleg and won't see a legitimate release? Add to that the decision to delay the release of the music video. I was glad when I listened to the album version and there it is - ""one night"" instead of ""one day"" and ""touching and kissing"" instead of ""dancing and chillin'"" - now that's more like it!As far as the rest of the disc, the songs are catchy, although there are like, a couple ballads that should've been deleted. Overall a great release, and the ""explicit"" version makes it so much better. A must have."
4,Not Bad,"Ashley Tisdale does NOT have the best of voices, but her songs are not so bad. Scott Storch gave her some good material. The beats are all dance worthy, the slow songs are typical but catchy, and the album as a whole has a fun factor. Unlove U is a remake of a Sarah Hudson song. It is exactly the same. Not a bad buy for tweens and maybe some older teens.the key tracks are: He Said She Said, Not Like That, Over It, and Headstrong"
4,Ashley Tisdale CD HeadStrong,We purchased this for our daughter for Christmas it arrived quickly in plaenty of time and she loves it she is also a miley cyrus fan so i would recommend this to other parents of tweens and or teens that like her also!
5,Awesome!,Music for your kids & you! Ashley delivers something for everyone and has a voice that doesn't irritate like a lot of teen stars. Add it to your collection!
2,Ashley--PULEEZE,"Ashley Tisdale is the girl we ""Disney Teens"" all know and love. She was like our blonde miley or something. And who doesn't love a new face in the acting industry? her acting is great, but somehow she just wanted more...we all know what THAT means.So Adhley sings. So what. She just CAN""T hold a note!!! So what? Well people today tend to think that teenagers are so stupid that we can't know a god voice when we hear it. We ALL know what happens when the disney girls sing right? WHY do they always sing anyway? I am NOT bashing Ashley. Maddie is so funny and I like her, but she is not a born singer. She whines. And her raping? One word: Cheesy.But then again if you enjoy mozeralla cheese music, then buy Headstorng. Just don't come to me when your ears fall clean off, OK?If you have iTunes however, download this track: He Said She Said. It's worth the money. And maybe be good to me. But otherwise, Ashley just isn't worth the money.~Attina"
5,GREAT album!,"What a great album! I would recommend this to anyone who likes pop music. It has a lot of catchy beats, and her gorgeous voice complements them well. Every track is something fresh!"
4,"You dont have to be a High School Musical fan to enjoy this, but you do have to be hers.","This is a really cool album, the songs are catchy and manage to run through your head for days, but her voice is not that great. and even though the songs are good, some of them get old fast.Songs recomended:So Much For YouHe Said She SaidBe Good To MeNot Like ThatLove Me For Me"
5,An awesome cd with a great beat!,I am 15 years old and i really love this cd! The songs are really catchy and the beat is great! I was a little skeptical about buying the cd at first because i figured it might be aimed towards young kids but its really not! i've listened to this cd over and over and I love it so much! I definitely recommend it.
4,Well Put Together,"It's got the whole Britney Spears vibe to it, but cleaner. The songs aren't as raunchy. For the type of music it is, which is typical tween-pop, the album actually holds its own. Worth the $9 - $10."
1,still waiting,i ordered this cd for my daughter for christmas never got it i tryed contacting the seller thru amazon no luck seller had no problem taking the payment out of my checking account though.had to use one star to rate to continue
3,armtruck,"Arm Truck,good design and quite light.Downsides are the wheels are very noisy and clunky.Generally speaking though I would give it a thumbs up."
5,Good Book!,"This was the first book that I read by Isaac Asimov and his writing stunned me. Every one of these stories is captivating and his ideas boggle the mind. My favorite short story of his is The Last Question. It is sooo good!!!!! I recommend this book to everyone! Also try to get your hands on his original short stories. They're great. A lot of his collections are out of print, but Amazon.com's pretty good at finding stuff for you."
3,Happy Go-Lucky Brawling Fun!,"If you are looking for a fun book which doesn't take the world too serious then this is it!This book was a great change from the typicaly long and extensively developed books which are becoming more and more common nowadays. Though not a deep and moving book (which I appreciate) it does provide many inovative ideas about possible (if improbable) alien species; their lovable too. You really get into saving the aliens and bagging the bad guys, all in the Retief fashion (two fisted diplomat, James Bond in space?), of course.Lots of laughs."
5,Classic Retief -- James Bond in Outer Space,"The secret to the Retief series is their strong tongue-in-cheek attitude. Taken at face value, the unimaginative reader might stumble over the sub-moronic aliens, the unlikely settings, or the fact that reality seems to often stand on it's head, for no obvious reason. But if you read these series as a parody of the James Bond series, then you can relax and enjoy the experience.And the subtext of Mankind as having a noble, heroic streak is the best ego boost I get from Sci-Fi. Let other authors portray humans as weak, greedy, venal, flawed : Laumer's Retief is a hero in the strongest sense of the word. If the future holds people like Retief, then maybe Mankind will survive to grow out of our weaknesses."
5,Review,I got this by request for my son's birthday. He loved it and has decided that Laumer is his favorite author!
3,sculpture,This is a great sand sculpture but it is very tiny. Somehow reading the dimensions and then seeing them were two different things. It looks terrific and can be mesmerizing but it is small and needs to be by itself wherever it is placed.
2,meh,The service was good. Product came in timely fashion wasn't broken or anything. Mine was pink and black which complimented each other very well. Only complaints were it is pretty small and the black sand hangs up like A LOT. I have yet to get it to totally go to one side. Which for a timer is kind of a bad thing which is why I only put two stars.
4,color,i would simply love it if the color was like in the picture shown. but instead of it being orange it was pink :( otherwise it's great and a very neat idea. i think people who like science will be really happy about this sand sculpture.
2,Entertaining Yet Tedious,"For those fans of post-apocalyptic fiction, this book may fit the bill as long as one can overlook the ham-fisted dialogue and superficial treatment of complex political and sociological issues. The dialogue I found to be incredibly forced in many spots. The characters are mere caricatures, over-the-top extremists with little thought to complexities most people exhibit. Of course, perhaps the book is ABOUT extremism, but it doesn't read like it--the extremists on one side have found the ""one true way"" and everyone else is tragically, utterly wrong. Not a complex treatment of any of the topics presented. The description of the world blowing up, often the more gripping parts of this type of fiction, is afforded little attention.Merely average, basically."
3,Smoke Reborn From The Ashes,"A modern day retired Special Forces Soldier, Ben Raines, is certainly Smoke Jensen reborn. He certainly feels that his is the only one type of justice for evil people and that justice needs to be handed out swift and hard. In this story, after a germ and nuclear war, Ben gets to defend a Tri-State conservative area of the Rocky Mountains against the corrupt and liberal Remnants of what is left of the East Coast United States goverment.Good vs. Evil; right vs. wrong; it's all here with violence and romance. But the action really drags and the story slows with the describing of the ""perfect"" Tri-State government. If you don't mind skim reading, the ending is OK and good enough to get me to read the next story in the series; someday. ""Preacher"" is still my favorite Johnstone character with the early Smoke Jensen next."
3,Fascinating,"I read this book more out of curiosity than anything else. I found the now 20 year old political views that swarm the book utterly fascinating, not always in a good way. The book is a not unusual (post) apocalyptic plot, flooded with political views interspersed with rather frank sex discussions. Rather too coarse to be interesting in my opinion, but I suppose that's personal view. No desire to read further into the series because the story line is not strong and not really what the author is bent on communicating. The author's website is kinda interesting, not seen anyone that prolific except certain romance authors. However, his stories are at that level... so I suppose it makes sense."
1,Do not waste your money or time,"This series is the most disappointing in my reading experience. After this book, which was mediocre, I started to read number 2 book in a lengthy series. The uncalled numerous foul language and lurid sex scenes detracted from what I thought was going to be a military thriller series. Needless to say, after the 2nd book, the 3rd was very similar and also repetitive in recalling scenes from the 1st 2 books in lengthy detail. I stopped reading the 3rd book after about 45 pages.Needless to say, I gathered up the rest of the 12 books I had purchased and not read, and put them out for recycling.In closing, I would like to state that this is my first 1 star review.Out Of The Ashes"
4,BEN RAINES IS WHAT MEN WISH THEY COULD BE LIKE.,I HAVE READ MOST OF THE OUT OF THE ASHES SERIES AND REREAD THE SAME ONES EACH TIME CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS WRITING ABOUT. I STOP AT ALL THE BOOKSTORES IN MY AREA SEARCHING FOR ONE I DON'T HAVE.PLEASE DON'T STOP WRITING THIS SERIES ANY TIME SOON.THANKS MATT
2,Out of the Ashes...Out of Ideas,"This is the first in William Johnstone's ""Ashes"" series. I've noticed it described as ""survivalist literature,"" which --though an oxymoron-- is probably as accurate as anything could be. I was surprised to find out that the author was an adult when this was written. The simple plot, the terrible dialogue, and the walking stereotypes that pass as characters made me assume it was written by a high school student... and not one from the gifted program. The scary thing is that Johnstone has written so many sequels. With the ultra-right element so vocal in America these days, I imagine it really does pass for literature among the militia types. Btw... I bought the sequel, thinking it might get better. It doesn't. It actually gets worse. And after reading this one, that's hard to believe."
1,Do Not waste your money,"I really tried to finish this book, after all I paid good money for it and I like post-apocalyptic fiction, but this book is just ridiculous. I kept hoping that it would get better but by the time I was half way through I realized it was only getting worse. The author couldn't decide if he wanted to lecture us about the evils of big government and society in general or titillate us with second rate (make that third rate) smut. DO NOT waste your money on this drivel."
2,Soft Porn,I was really looking forward to reading this book but it disappointed me. The plot and charaters at the begining are hard to follow. Then the book degenerates into basically the sexual exploits of the main charater and unprobable gun fights. This book is really adolescent and appears to be written by a teenager. I got about halfway through the book and it did not appear to be going anywhere getting any better so quit reading it. Maybe Amazon will buy it back slightly used.
2,"Starts with a bang, finishes with a wimper","The beginning of the book is excellent; with a rebellion brewing and nuclear apocylpse approaching. The story continues with the day-to-day survival of people across the country. Ben Raines eventually ends up recruiting a base of survivers and sets up a new state- Tri-State. This is where the book goes downhill; it goes downhill fast, in a very short period of time. He sets up his state and turns it into a conservative-utopia (an oxymoron in itself). A barbaric society results. A society with very few morals. A society that at times reminded me of Orwell's 1984. It almost seems as if Johnstone attempted to make more of a political statement than tell an entertaining story. If you are a good true blue American liberal, such as myself, don't bother with this book."
1,Ben Raines??? Get serious,"I have read this and seven other books of the ""in the ashes"" series. Frankly I just don't like them. They are pretty poorly written and are not something that looks like it will happen. Ben Raines and his army go around America distributing Uzi's to farmers and telling them to fight. Yeah, right. Johnstone seems to think this SUSA army is invinvcible, going around America killing hundreds of thousands of criminals and losing something like a few hundred Rebels. He seems to think everyone is fed up with the American goverenment. While we may have our problems with it, we would not just go and join some Soldier of Fortune militia. If a real life ""Raines"" ever took his army and formed a new country he would be smashed by Americans who wouldn't put up with that kind of crap. ""Raines"" real army would be filled with a bunch of military rejects. This series is one of the worst I have ever read. Don't waste your time looking at it."
1,"Possibly the worst book ever written, but Hi-Lar-ious!","This book is beyond description. It reads like an eighth grader wrote it, but without the deep thought of said middle schooler. The action is jumpy, the text almost pure exposition, and over half of the book is devoted to an extended rant/diatribe. And even the diatribe is unorganized, jumping from ""get tough on crime"" speeches to the main character's desire to ""screw"" a reporter he sees on television. All this being said, I couldn't put it down because I couldn't stop laughing. If you've ever wanted to look at truly bad pulp fiction with no attempt at organization or editing, be sure and pick up this book. I also enjoyed the author's musings on the coming race war. Thanks for the info, Johnstone! You are truly the greatest American hero."
2,An average apocalyptic book but politically extreme.,"This book makes an attempt to validate the most exasperating elements of the far right and far left. Taking children away from their families because they don't agree politically with Johnstone's utopian government and a sliding tax rate that places an extreme burden on the wealthy are just some examples. On the plus side, not a bad survivalist fiction.I would instead recommend PATRIOTS; Surviving the Coming Collapse by Rawles as an all-around better book with more palatable politics and solid survivalism information."
1,Switch,"Does not work with Nintendo Game Cube at all, only Black amd white picture with PS2. Not Good at all!"
4,A pop comeback,"This is Sheena's best album since 1984's ""A Private Heaven."" It is a straight pop album with a nice mix of light dance tunes along with some searing ballads, which are the strong point of this CD. The best tune in this package is ""Till Death Do Us Part."" This torch song about an ending relationship is mixed with a grove provided by producer and arranger Narada Michael, best known for his work with Whitney Houston. Other highlights include the David Foster track ""You've Learned to Live Without Me"" and ""Dance Away the Blues."" ""All I ask of You"" provides a lighter more positive mood to this album. Sheena was going for a straight pop album here, and she hits the mark."
5,no doubts! one of her best!,"Whith""My Cherie"",Sheena puts out one of the best album in her entire carrer;no questions about it! This is about of very goods songs and of course,FABULOUS VOICE!! STANDOUTS TRAKS:'till death do us part,all i ask of you, you've learn to live without me,and dance away the blues... Listen to this album,you won't be disapointed,you can be sure of that!!"
2,Falling into the Adult Contemporary Trap,"As as is the case with many aging pop artists, Sheena Easton decided to take refuge with safe adult-contemporary music on this album, and the result is not terribly exciting overall (unless you're thrilled with what's played on adult-contemporary stations--I'm not). There are some good songs on here: ""My Cherie,"" ""'til Death Do Us Part,"" ""All I Ask of You,"" (this one is a little syrupy) and ""Too Much in Love."" The other tracks do not really shine, and some are just plain bad or boring. If you like the up-tempo Sheena Easton, you might want to pass on this album."
4,Black & Decker FS350 1/3 Sheet Finish Sander,"This sander does exactly what I want a sander to do! When I saw the ""dust collection"" feature, I had my doubts. After I connected it to my Shop Vac, it worked just fine. The variable speed adjustment is a great feature for this sander. I have no complaints with this sander."
2,A waste of a great idea,"I'm a big fan of WWII alternative history and picked up this book in the hopes of being engaged by an intelligent and well written story -- well, lets just say that it was a good idea. To get this book you have to suspend some basic facts about the war in 1944 -- but that's not the problem. The authors just couldn't deliver a well-written story. The bland and lifeless dialogue aside, at least give the characters some dignity -- for instance when Von Staffenberg accuses Jodl of kissing Hitler&#65533;s ""rosy red rectum"" -- come on - did these German officers talk like that? That's the moment I lost respect for the book, and that's only on page 62! If you're looking for an intelligent alternative history regarding the same time, pick-up ""Disaster at D-Day"" by Peter Tsouras instead. If you're looking for some low-brow chop shop writing - you know where to look."
4,Enjoyable Military Alternate History,"Fox on the Rhine is an enjoyable piece of alternate history based on the supposition that the plot to assasinate Hitler had succeeded. The book is packed with battle scenes and historic figures like Rommel, Himmler, and Patton reacting to the new situation. The book bogs down a little in intrigues between the assasins and the NAZIs. Also one would have really liked to know how the post war world would have looked under the changed circumstances (perhaps in a sequal?). Nevertheless I could hardly put the book down, which for my busy lifestyle is praise indeed.(...)"
5,An excellent read,"The authors of this book have crafted an enjoyable and believable piece of fiction around interesting and exciting events. While some of the circumstances do require some suspension of disbelief, that's certainly par for the course with Alternate History writing. Anyone looking for a good read with some well-thought-out twists will do well to pick up this book. The authors are to be congratulated."
4,What If !,"If you like WWII and ever wondered what would happen if things turned out differently, well then this book is for you. What if the assassination attempt on Hitler succeeded? Beautiful stuff."
4,Engaging and plausible,"A great novel which take the basic historical facts, takes a key turning point and flips it round. The way in which the authors achieves this creates a unique reading experience. The reader will be ready for the sequel. Recommended to anyone who likes history."
3,"Nice try, but . . .","The biggest and most frustrating problem with this book is that it needed a good editor and didn't get one. The authors make mistakes in their German, malapropism in their English, and silly goofs in their military history. I liked the book's overall approach and subject matter, and the first 3/4 or so is quite plausible and well done. The conclusion is the weakest part, in that it is only sketched, and even the sketch is unpersuasive. I just hope this book makes it into a second edition that refines and expands what is at bottom a promising work."
1,Not for the serious fan of alternate history,"I believe that the writers had a good, if fanciful, idea when they came up with the premise for this book. Even the unlikely separate peace with the Soviets was an interesting take.The problem with this book is in the writing. The authors are proffessional game designers which, I am sure helped in working out the fictional tactics and strategies used by the combatants, but, they should have employed a writer to at least help them with their style and substance. I found the characters to be flat and in some cases cartoonish. The authors use of German was poor at best, ham fisted at worst.Read this book if you have a few hours to kill, but if you have anything better to do, like trim your toenails, take a pass."
2,What is the point? What is the reason?,"Why write a novel with 'what if' premise if the result will be the same? So Hitler dies and there is a chance to turn the war around for Germans.... then let the Germans win or at least have them take France and Poland and call it a draw. What the hell was the purpose of the book if Patton will continue to beat up on Germans? At the least, have Patton or Eisenhower assasinated and come up with a good story. This book was a waste of time and money. You guys can skip this one because you are not missing out on anything."
5,Fascinating!,"This alternate history develops a fascinating story around the idea ""What if Hitler had been killed in the 1944 bomb plot?"" It's gripping as well as intelligent and the authors delight with their fresh style. Michael Dobson and Douglas Niles wrote a book that not only the older generation with interest in WWII will enjoy up to the last page. It's also a great book for young people and will get them interested in an important part of history."
2,Lid does not fit properly,It is very difficult to get the lid on and after a few weeks of use the lid is broken from trying to force it on. If the lid was better it would be a nice product.
2,Not what expected...,"It seems Nordicware has changed the material the product is made of and I cannot find any information about the new material...As an item used in Microwave cooking, I would like to know more, when a company changes material///"
2,So so,"First of all, I wear a men's size 12 shoe which puts me at the upper size range for these socks. They were a little snug and not what I expected from a diabetic sock and certainly not like other diabetic socks I have purchased in the past.Otherwise, the socks were very comfortable and I had high hopes for them. Alas, after only a few wearings, holes appeared in the toe area. So I trimmed and buffed my toenails and tried again with another pair ... this pair lasted a little longer but holes still appeared pretty quickly.Perhaps they will work better for someone with smaller feet, but I won't be reordering this product."
3,Didn't work for me this time - maybe just my mood?,"I don't know whether I've changed or Keillor, but I didn't get as much pleasure out of this collection of Lake Wobegon vignettes as I have from other books. As ever with collections like this I'm probably more reflecting on the last few stories because I stretch my reading over several months. Maybe I've reached some sort of saturation point. There were some good moments, but rather than finding most of these stories whimsically touching I found them inconsequential. I didn't identify with any of the characters as much as I have in other books. I'm cautious about dismissing it - I wonder if in a different mood I would have liked it - but where I am now it didn't connect."
4,"Not his best collection of writings, but enjoyable","I have loved PHC for years, but have just recently started reading GK's work. He spins wonderful yarns, but I found this collection of stories a bit disjointed past the midway point of the book. One thing that is nearly always consistent is that ""It was another quiet week in Lake Wobegon."""
5,Liked It,A genie offers you three wishes after you open a cola can. But then your wishes seem to be against you.
5,Highly recommended for young students.,"I had the opportunity to watch this on PBS before it came out on DVD. I'm an elementary music teacher and there is a condensed version of this documentary on VHS in our textbook series. I showed this to my fifth grade class and they were in awe. They had so many questions to ask and were so intrigued. I never had the fine opportunity of seeing or hearing Mr. Stern live, but I strongly live by the quote he says at the end of the documentary. It truly is a touching and moving one."
5,A Powerful & Timeless Documentary,"So pleased to now have this DVD after seeing it numerous times when it was first released in New Zealand in the early 80's. It made an huge impact then and it does the same to friends who see it now.Seeing young people make their music come to 'life' after the 'cultural revolution' had robbed them of their personality and soul is so powerful. Issac Stern showed time after time that music without the personal energy and soul of the musician is nothing and with words of guidance along with his energy and passion, their music comes to life.The new extras added since the original movie, including Issac Stern's return to Beijing 20 years later are a real bonus."
2,Oops,"The applesauce carrot cake recipe is missing steps. It does not tell you what to DO, when, with the carrots, walnuts or raisins."
4,For $5 it's pretty good.,"I actually didn't buy this on Amazon, I bought it at Walmart for $5. And I have to say that for $5 it's a pretty good documentry. Sure the intro is always the same, and sure the same three guys are interviwed throughout the entire thing, but the information they give you is pretty interesting. Depending on what you know of the serial killers that are listed in this 7 1/2 DVD you may or may not learn something new. It has it's highs and it's lows, but again I only paid $5 for it. I wasn't expecting too much, so in my mind I got more than I paid for. If you're interested in serial killers, or you know someone that is, it's a pretty interesting dvd. It's held my intrest."
2,Very cheeseball,"The price was good, but you get what you pay for. I hate to offend but it was put together quite cheesy, I was hoping for an in depth approach with new and fascinating details into America's serial killers, I found it very boring and at times completely uninteresting. It was very inexpensive however definately lacked cinematic quality."
2,Shallow,"What a disappointment. The facts are slim. Old movies are passed off as representations of the crimes. In the Jack the Ripper segment, for example, we have lengthy scenes from inaccurate 1930s films. But by far the worst is the stupid music (that screech from ""Psycho"") and the even stupider, more banal narration.The ""experts"" who tell us about the killers are strutting, preening dolts who think that putting a label on something (e.g., the urge to kill) explains it. The killers are psychopaths, sociopaths, we hear from the self styled scholars of crime. So what? That doesn't explain anything or add one iota to our understanding. It would be better to leave all that out and just give the facts. I've seen TV programs that do a far better job of telling what happened.Skip this set of DVDs. Someone will surely do this subject better."
3,Basic Overview,"Got it out of a bargain bin at Walmart for $5. It offers exactly what it says, portraits. Anyone with interest in serial killers will not learn mush if any at all new."
3,Serial Killer Docu,This isn't what I expected it to be but it was still an interesting movie if serial killers spark your interests. It's a docu so if you have something you need facts this is a good buy.
2,"The materials, not the content, was my problem","I, too, got this at Wal-Mart for $5. The 1st episode played fine (yes, the intro is over the top & it feels silly based on the title to start with a British serial killer but whatever), but the 2nd episode started hanging & eventually froze completely. None of the other shows would play, & disc 2 was the same way.I took it back to Wal-Mart to exchange, & the new set won't play, either disc. I've successfully ripped the 1st disc to my hard drive but the 2nd has unrecoverable errors, so I will take THIS one back as well and try for a 3rd set to get a readable 2nd disc.If I ever get a copy that will play, I will review the content. This is ridiculous! I'm a bit surprised nobody's mentioned issues with trying to get the discs to play. Am I just really unlucky?Hopefully the 3rd time's the charm..."
4,not bad,i agree with adam this is a good buy at wal mart out ofthe five dollar bin but the amazon price isnt bad bad for the length of this 2 disc set. this is all info you probably already have if youre into true crime but still not a bad buy. i would have to say for the earlier featured kilers they used too much of related movie footage for filler. the interviews and narration are done well with the exception of when the narrator reads letters from the killers in their voices. this is so terrible its funny. at times i was convinced i was listening to richard dreyfuss until i heard those awful voices. buy this if you like this kind of thing. for under ten dollars you get 7 hrs of info and footage of over 20 cases. and interviews with some of the minds who have studied the subject extensively. even dr jack levin of MSNBC crime documentary fame gets in on the action. the price makes this worth it.
1,NOTHING NEW,"I was hoping to get at least some new information, but nothing.The extremely short Manson segment was not only vague, but my DVD skipped or had broken up digital skips in it. I could barely see what was happening.I was very disappointed."
5,Seminal Resource for Theatrical Artists,"Covering important early stage design throught the early '90s, this is immeasurably important to the understanding of how scenic elements enhance theatrical production."
2,"Good Bag, Bad Fit","If you don't KNOW for SURE that this bag will fit your rack, you ought to determine so BEFORE you buy it.This is a great bag with many excellent features, BUT as someone else wrote, the velcro straps ARE short, and if your rack isn't exactly what is required, the bag will fit poorly and flop around.My suggestion: go to your local bike shop, find a rack (and perhaps a bag) you like, THEN try to find it on Amazon. These are very difficult to buy correctly without seeing how they'll fit/attach on YOUR bike."
5,All the stopping without all the shaking,I purchased these rotors because my car was shaking itself to do death whenever I lightly applied the brakes. The rotors solved that issue (thankfully). Great pricing and fast shipping via amazon.
3,"If you are a hard 80`s dance fan this CD is a must, but...","For me it is a good buy, since there are some songs I was trying to get from some time ago. One example is Land of Hunger by The Earons an extremely rare dance track of the 80`s. For me, was a surprise when I found that was the extended version of the song. The same comment for the Mexican by early infamous DJ Jellybeam since you cannot find this songs in any store at this time. If you are a hard 80`s dance fan this CD is a must. In the other hand, I was wondering which were the parameters for choosing the songs in the compilation, since not all of the titles were No.1`s. At the same time, there were another pure dance tracks that deserved to be in this compilation."
1,Bad music,This CD is the worst CD i've ever heard in my life. Mainly because the songs(remixes) are so dumb-sounding. I would rather listen to ten hours of somebody scratching their fingernails across a chalkboard than to hear this CD.
1,wack,prince almost wrecks his own song.good thing for him that hardly anyone bought this version or his original would have been out of time.
1,A Pleasure,"This music is a pleasure to listen to if you're into remixes. But if you're like me, a die-hard Prince fam, this music is NOT 'for you'. (No pun intended; Prince fams will understand). I highly suggest joining the NPG Music Club. The music distributed through Prince's online site has ""modern"" music but not annoying modern music featured on this recording."
1,WHY WOULD HE RELEASE THIS?,"Not to rag on Prince, but this CD is unnecessary. These new versions do not give me any reason to not listen to old version. The rap parts just do not do it and the others are just not very listenable at all. I listened to the CD once and threw it in my CD pile. How about a dance version or some type of crafty remix instead of just trying to re-record it. You can't repeat the magic you had when you originally recorded it. That was a different time and place. I am getting tired of buying disappointing CD from him. They just do not have anything to get excited about. Focus..."
1,Blasphemous!,"Blasphemous! I quit buying ANYTHING by Prince after he released this insult. At first I was embarrassed listening to it, then became disgusted, and eventually angry. All copies should be collected and destroyed. Zero stars."
2,Only 2 tracks I dig...,"I bought my copy from the Fye store for $5.99..well all I can say about this CD is that it ain't all of that 4 all u starters out there I recommend u get this CD LAST not much u're missin' only bought it b/c I had some extra money.The CD disc itself has a very nice design 2 it & a nice side pic of the Artist..but that's 'bout it.Track 2: Rosario{1999 1:19--I know short but I liked the instrumental in the background, I think it was like the beginning part of ""Little Red Corvette"" instrumental style.Track 4: 1999{KeepSteppin' 4:33--I dig the beat on it, had that sorta relaxed/just chillin' style 2 it.It was cool 2 see/hear Doug E. Fresh(a part of the ol'school hip hop) on there, including Rosie Gaines & Larry Graham.Conclusion, only buy this CD if it's $5.99(or LESS)--u're probably just be payin' 4 the nice album art on it anyway."
2,Disappointing...,"As a big Prince fan, I was majorly disappointed with this release. 1999: The New Master itself isn't bad. It's okay... not really an improvement on the original but not terrible. The other remixes stink! Rosario is not really a 1999 remix, but a spoken word thing which is interesting. To me, the rest is essentially unlistenable.Oh well... obviously it was meant as a statement against the industry rather than quality from Prince, but still a disappointment."
1,Thumbs Down,"Unfortunately, this Prince CD deserves thumbs down. It is a MUST for any hardcore Prince fan's collection, but the CD as whole is lacking something I can't wuite put my finger on. The CD, has its good points, but there is an empty overtone throughout the five songs. This is recommended for people who like dance music, this CD is excellent for parties-New Year's Eve parties to be more exact! Take a listen for fun, but double check and make sure this is the one you want."
1,Definitely not the best,"This EP is definitely not one of Prince's best releases.In fact, it is his worst. ""1999:The New Master"" lacks the quality and care of any other Prince EP's,albums,and singles.The music is thoughtlessly thrown together with raps from Doug E.Fresh and soul scatted vocals from Rosie Gaines.Larry Graham lends his vocals to a few of the tracks and Rosario Dawson has a spoken word cameo.As for Prince,his part on the EP is small,he sings a few lines on most of the tracks and then seems to disappear.He doesn't even seem to enjoy the recording.This EP is ONLY for those who must collect EVERYTHING by an artist.This release is a major disappointment."
1,ridiculous and unnecessary- should be ZERO STARS,"You can get the original version on the 1982 album, ""1999"", or either ""The Hits 1"" or ""The Hits/The B-sides."" This is for the most die-hard fans around only...deserves ZERO STARS"
1,Prince can still jam,"Prince can still jam his heart out. His vocals and lyrics are so unique, but you won't find any of that here on this EP. It's sadly disappointing. The music is really bad and the appearance of Dou E. Fresh and Rosie Gaines seems forced. This EP I heard was made to raise money for charity, either way this one should be listened to because it was created by the one and only- PRINCE."
1,A Sad Story,"This CD makes me cry because it is so awful. I can't believe this is the same man that came out with ""Purple Rain"". This is recommended for SERIOUS Prince fans only, it will NOT appeal to the average listener."
5,PURE FUNK ONCE AGAIN FROM THE ARTIST!,THE ARTIST HAS DONE IT AGAIN. I KNOW THAT EVERY PEICE OF MUSIC I BUY FROM HIM IS GOING TO BE A WINNER! KEEP THE MUSIC FREE. PEACE AND BE REAL! SHADOWPIXIE
4,"a fast, enjoyable read.","I have no idea how I came across this book, but I'm glad that I did.I enjoyed all of the charchters in it, even the ones I'm sure I wasn't supposed to. Everyone is very lively and belivable, even with a few extraordinary quirks thrown in.I can't give a very detailed review; since it took me just a day or so to read it- and that was about 20 or 25 days ago.I just wanted to give the author his due (which he has already gotten) and just say something positive aobut his writing... I uses the term 'doofy tooth' for... almost anything now."
4,Unlike anything else,"The ECSTATIC is very unlike any book that you have ever read. It is equal parts funny, sad, and [sorry]. The lead character appears to jump off the pages and talk directly to the reader. My favorite line is when he makes excuses for eating something that he had no business eating, and as if he knows the readers don't really believe him, he turns and says ""Oh Shut Up"". It was straight out of Little Richard's mouth, I loved it. The author truly stepped out of the box for this one and did a good job doing it. Well worth the read."
1,What?!!!!,"This book pissed me off!!!!I didn't get that the character was suffering from a mental disorder I just thought he was plain...straight up stupid. The book truly made no sense to me. The only reason I finished the book because the back drop was my home Jamaica, Queens and I love to read books that take place around my way.Please do not waste your time with this book. I can't even explain it it was so....uuuggghhhh!!!"
2,"Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200","I'm honestly not sure how I felt about this book. They're some hilariously cunning moments, but overall the book was pretty weird and a little confusing. I finished it because, frankly, I started it. It definitely wasn't a page turner or a book I lost sleep over. Overall, I think that the writer's style just couldn't hold my interest, others that read it obviously thought it was good...but, I beg to differ!"
3,"Not bad, but","Bought this 2 years ago. Within the warranty period, the DVI port went out. I RMA'ed it, and received a new card. Again the DVI port failed, but this time it was out of the warranty window so I was out of luck. Tried to contact eVGA customer support to no avail. In brief, it worked fine for most purposes, and I seemed to have no problem with processing RAW images. But don't count on the DVI port to be around for long."
4,Help on disable on-board graphic card,"I just purchased one, but I do not know how to disable on-board graphic card.Can anyone help me on this?Thanks,"
3,need analog output for 16:10 widescreen monitor,"When I installed this card with a Samsung SyncMaster 226BW LCD monitor with a widescreen 16:10 format, and a DVI digital cable, I could not select a higher resolution than 1280x960 (4:3 format), even though the EVGA spec sheet states that 1600x1024 is available. All images were distorted because the horizontal dimension was getting stretched to fit the 16:10 format of this monitor. Calls to Samsung and EVGA confirmed the latest drivers were installed. Samsung tech support says their monitor supports a 1680x1050 DVI input. EVGA tech support had me switch to an analog cable, and create a custom 1680x1050 resolution (native resolution for this Samsung monitor) using the EVGA classic panel. Using the analog output of the card at the new 1680x1050 resolution gave an excellent image on the monitor. This 22"" monitor has 3000:1 contrast ratio and 2ms response time. The ""3"" rating is because of the limited EVGA resolution using the digital output."
3,So So,"This is pretty good ran Halo No problem. Played final fantasy 11 online with no problem. And lets you play Video, DVDs or whatever. If it is all you can afford it will do the job. 3 star rating is just because I know one with more memory would be better.1gb ideally. But this will work and give you your money's worth.And I still have it just incase of emergency and I need to use it. I know it will work.Aztec Legend Lord of the JaguarsLove Eternally"
5,First Rate Production is a MUST for Serling Fans,"This is an excellent biographical documentary about the life and works of Rod Serling. It is brilliantly constructed and edited. This well crafted presentation is a first rate production all around. Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. His endearing legacy, ""The Twilight Zone"" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form until very recently. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. I originally saw this documentary on Public Television and was pleased to find it issued on VHS. Highly recommended!"
3,An interesting departure from earlier work,"Steven Wilson never sits still. ""Signify"" is a move in a pleasant direction. There's still some of the atmospheric stuff that marked earlier works such as ""The Sky Moves Sideways"" and ""Up the Downstair"" but there are also slightly more upbeat -- musically if not lyrically -- ballads. ""Sever,"" not written by Wilson, is one of the highlights in my opinion. ""Dark Matter,"" the moody closer to disk one, is another of the best song. The bonus CD contains demos and unreleased stuff. Among the most enjoyable is the acoustic version of ""Nine Cats."" You could sing along to it with your kids without a worry."
4,"Strong disk, halfway between spacy and focused",Progression from the initial spacy sounds of The Sky .... and the focused songwriting of In Absentia and Deadwing. Sleep with No Dreaming and the two Waiting tracks are very strong. Recommend for PT fans who appreciate Absentia and Deadwing.
2,Not worth 5 bucks.,"I heard very good reviews for this band from many places so I went out and bought it and I was deeply disappointed! This is probably the worst album I ever bought. First of all, most of the tracks are filled up with nothing but noise, the lyrics are pathetic and there are no REAL dynamics to any song, just constantly repeating notes. Many people told me this was music genious. I would not even call this music. Playing really slow notes with a bunch of symphonic noise behind it doesn't make you a music genious. This album doesnt belong anywhere near the rock genre."
5,"A ""MUST HAVE""","Being a person who is constantly searching for new music from all corners of the globe, I have been stunned by the sheer brilliance of Porcupine Tree's effort on Signify. This album has it all. The song writing is very unique, and the music which it accompanies is right on the money. They kind of remind me of Pink Floyd in their earlier years. I just took delivery of Signify and The Sky Moves Sideways two days ago, and I cannot stop listening to them. This is the type of music just grabs hold of you, and sweeps you up into another realm. Truly a MUST HAVE for people who like to expand their musical horizons - away from what the ""mainstream"" radio shoves down our throats."
3,Liked other P. T. recordings better,"I like other Porcupine Tree CDs much better. This disc is a little too moody for for my taste, it drifts. In spite of this luke warm review, this is a GREAT band!!"
3,Toby Tyler Review,I purchased this for my nephews (ages 6 - 10) after taking them to the local circus. I was rather disappointed with the small print. If I had been aware of how small the print is in this book I would not have purchased until they were much older. It turned out to be more of a book to be read from than for the boys to read themselves.

3,"A Real Hoot!,","Owl Puke(TM) is a wonderful hunters tool used for trapping pigeons which feed on the poop and vomit of nighttime owls, which by the way, has plenty of calcium and protein. Just spread this out on the snow and wait a few moments and about one hundred pigeons will fly there instantly. Suggestion: buy about 100 packs of this because actually its rather tasty."
2,GOOD PRICE BUT DOES NOT CHARGE,"BATTERY CAME IN GOOD CONDITION. IT DOES NOT RECHARGE. I HAVE CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER , THIS IS A DISCONTINUED UNIT.NOT USEFUL FOR ME AT ALL."
4,A Great introduction to Embedded systems.,"A very acessible and easy to read book which provides a tour of the embedded system development process. Ideal for any SW/HW newcomers to the embedded world. This book is not ""the definitive reference"" on Embedded systems design, but I do think it is a very worthy prelude for anyone about to immerse themselves in the field."
3,A Good Introductory Text,"This book offers a clear view of the embedded system design process. If you are a newcomer, it can help you clear up the mystery and it is a easy reading. If you have been through a embedded project from ground up, this is not the book for you. Even though I like this book, it lacks of depth and the text closed up in a hurry."
2,A good primer but poor writing,"This book provides introduction to many important aspects of embedded systems design. Disappointingly, in many parts of the book, the writing is quite incoherent and lacks proper organization of thoughts. The author may be a good engineer but certainly not a good writer."
2,Introductory book which skips the technical details,"A book for someone who is developing first embedded system(s). Limited coverage, but has some good references at the end of each chapter that might be helpful to the reader."
5,Just As Good As The First Thousand,"After an overly long exposition from THE FIRST THOUSAND YEARS, this set takes off with wings of brilliance considering how many topics and issues it must cover.Again, please do not take this set as an encompasing piece of information. Like the preceding series, it completes an INTRODUCTION to Christianity's first two thousand.Excellent."
2,Not very good quality,"We've seen 2 out of the 3 movies, and in each of them there are several sections where the audio is out of sync. Groundhog Day is a good movie; Ghostbusters has not really held up over time (especially for my 13-year-old)."
4,Stripes and Groundhog Day great,Bought this because we really enjoy Stripes and Groundhog day. Have not watched Ghostbusters yet.
3,Possible Bad Disk,"This package set is a good idea and worth the purchase, however, be aware that you may receive a bad ""Groundhog Day"" disk. Several scenes freeze or have scanning problems, which seriously detract from viewing pleasure. Amazon probably is unaware of this difficulty, because I have never been disappointed with the company's products before. The other two movies were trouble-free."
2,buy something else,"Well I took the Financial Markets course at my university, both of my professors are very good at conveying information. Then when I read this textbook, man all the things in my head were messed up. This textbook is kind of Reviews of Money, Banking and FN Markets. It never really add more information to your brain if you have already taken couple of FN courses. I do recommend Financial Markets and Institutions by Jeff Madura or Money, Banking and Financial Markets by Stephen Cecchetti. Those guys are easier to read and follow."
3,Good book but there r better options out there,"Great book but a bit too general somewhat out of date i would get later Editions. However Mishkin makes things easy to understand. Too bad Economics and markets got too ""Sketchy"" lately."
3,His treatment of money is the book's saving grace,"The book, on the whole, is an average introductory textbook that follows the standardized view of mainstream economics (the accuracy of that standard is left for a different review). Mishkin begins by telling us that financial markets and institutions are fascinating, and then spends the next 400 pages treating the subject in a tired and linear fashion.His tone rarely strays from that of the typical bored professor, with his treatment of money being the exception. When he explores money, Mishkin's tone is suddenly vibrant with vivid examples and colorful wording.If you must buy the book, do it for the money."
2,Mediocre,"This movie is about a boy, Zack, who is taken back to the time before King Arthur became a king, by Arthur's sister, who wants another to put Zack on the throne instead. Zack and Merlin must convince Arthur that he is the true king, otherwise history will be changed and Zack won't be able to return to the 20th century.Some of the actors in this movie are quite good and some are mediocre. The worst thing about the movie is some of the computer made visual effects. The story is a bit silly and the movie is not as entertaining as it should be. Watch this only if it's on TV and you really have nothing better to do. Don't waste your money on it."
4,Conceptual Physics,"I am a retired engineer, but now translating technical document.The book of ""Conceptual Physics"" is helpful to learn basic theoryof technical writing."
4,Beware that the lab book comes with package edition,I bought this book for my high school daughter so I can't really rate it. But be aware that the lab book comes with the package edition so don't order it separately or you'll have to send it back like I did.
1,Terrible.,"This book is extremely confusing and has too much distracting information. It's sad that many schools use this as their text on physics. There is little to no math in this book to assist you, yet the review sections expect you to know the math to do the work. How is that possible? Terrible book."
4,not bad,I was initially worried when the book had some sort of Asian writing on the front but inside is in english. I'm about 5 weeks in to the course and so far everything matches up to the regular text book. Works for me.
1,Worst physics textbook yet!,"This book is highly unorganized, important concepts are all over the chapters. The illustrations are bad, distracting and most of the time, not descriptive. But the worst thing is at the end, some review questions and exercises require students to know some equations that are never touched in the book; some questions require you to know some Algebra 2 level stuff and some concepts are not taught."
4,Wild and Wacky,"As wild and wacky as I remember it! I had this on vinyl in the 70's... I got it from one of those old bargain record places in a downtown cellar. Cool.This one take me back to that crazy time when things Indian were extremely exotic... but the music here is still pretty good. Shankar was a man who once transcended cultures. It was all very exciting back then.Previn is good too. Hey, if you want some more wacky 70's tracks check out the synth music Previn composed forRollerball. Groovy yet with some musical merit. Too bad you can't buy the individual tracks as MP3 :-("
3,Not waterproof,"It's supposed to be waterproof. But, water went through it during the first rain when it was brand new. Otherwise, it's fine."
1,the quality of print is really bad,"The book's content is ok. It's the quality of the print of eBook. It's really really bad, almost unreadable. Worse? I can't return it."
4,Don't take it too seriously,"This book is a satirical look at our highly achieving society. Work hard and you end up being incompetant. The authors make up a number of names for conditions and symptoms to attempt to say the choices you have in life are incompetancy or enjoyment through diversions. I started off reading it as a ""real"" social psychological work with testimonials and cases. By the end, the absurd diagnoses, which all of us show to some degree, made me realize that I believe the authors are just trying to say don't take your career too seriously."
2,Should have been a pamphlet,"The darkly humurous Peter Principal itself is easy to understand and witness in life. I mostly agree with the presentation of it. Fine. Write a pamphelt and be done with it? No, append more material and sell books, no matter how forced the extra bulk is. The book really gets tiresome when Peter tries to quantify and name (after himself) almost every aspect of organizational beheavior (real or otherwise). Nothing can be as precisely packaged as this diatribe attempts to do."
4,Good until the end,"I read this book with great enthusiasm, having heard so much about it. And sure enough, the first few chapters were great. But the ending was kind of a letdown. I feel that Dr. Peter built up my expectations and then failed to deliver what I really needed: how to avoid the P.P."
5,Awesome!,"How have I not ever heard of this? It's such a part of our culture. The generation before mine has read this and incorporated it, and not told the next generation. This is a must read."
1,"SAVE TIME, LOOK IT UP IN WIKIPEDIA","We discussed this principle at work so I thought I would get the book. What a waste of time! Save yours.You can look it up in Wikipedia and get the gist of the whole book in a few sentences. You might wantto check out the ""Dilbert Principle"" while you are at it."
3,Handy Little Device,"If you're looking for a quick shoe shine without lots of arm spinning, this is for you. The 4 AA batteries provide adequate power, but I was able to slow the motor down by pressing hard into the shoe. The shine cans had dried up in my set, so I'll have to use my own shine. Brushes and pads are color coded which is handy. The set could use carry or storage case, as packaging is a cardboard box with thin plastic insert that won't last long term. Set will put a good shine on shoes but doesn't measure up to the professional floor buffer."
3,GET THIS MOVIE FOR JACK LONG!!!!!,"So the story starts out showing Judy Lee(Queen Boxer) and Doris Lung(Master Of the Flying Guillotine) who have been trained in Shaolin from childhood so that they can go and take revenge for their family. I thought that Shaolin didn't train people just for revenge but anyways the plot is not exactly electric.What is fun though is the 2 kung fu gorillas and their long tongued trainers and JACK LONG!!!!!!! Jack shows up as a fan weilding assassin and then has a fight with ALL of the stars at the end. It is amazing watching Jack go up against Dorian Tan, Carter Wong, and the ladies. Other sources have wrongly speculated that this is Blacky Ko playing this character but I guarantee you it is the one and only Jack Long.I don't know about the tai seng version but the picture in the 50 pack released by Tree line films is full screened with watchable pictrue quality."
2,Not the best cover CD!,"I mainly bought this CD because 16volt is on it and I was guest hosting a podcast where I played industrial covers. 16volt did a cover of the TV theme ""Love Boat"", which is why it got 2 stars instead of 1. I really didn't like the rest of it."
3,Probably be a good toy for a Quaker parakeet or a Sun Conure,"An entertaining toy with soft, colorful wood rings for the birds to chew. My concern about the toy though, is the large bell that hangs in the middle of the chain. A smaller bell would enable the bird to get as close to the wood rings as he wants without getting startled. (Cockatiels startle easily.) This would probably be a good toy for a Quaker parakeet or a Sun Conure."
3,The only game in town,"Overall, this is a great guide for the price. They cover everything in the game with their walkthrough, as well as the bonus game. I would have been willing to pay for more content though. This guide won't help you get an S rank, you'll have to figure out what stuff to skip in order to do that."
5,Love it!,My husband wanted this movie and he loves it. He has watched it several times now. He says its a reminder of when he use to ride bmx back in the 80's. Thanks again!!
3,Confused,"Since I bought this off amazon, I've only been using the radio. I know that you need to use Sonicstage to upload songs, but what format do the songs have to be in to keep from skipping/clicking? I've tried; mp3, atrac 3, and I've tried every bit rate in these formats. Does anyone know what I have to do to get the music to play smoothly?Other than that, the radio's sweet and it's shaped like a little cigar."
4,wonderful,"Amazing player. The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of its accompanying software. It's a bit cumbersome to use. But the player itself is a piece of beauty. Looks great, plays great."
2,There are much better products on the market,Rechargeable battery is good as is the 'shuffle control'. Unfortunately this product comes with the aweful SonicStage software which HAS to be used. I bought the Walkman for running with but the supplied headfones have a very poor fit. Rather get a competitors product where you aren't bound to SonicStage software (I had a Creative before this and regret not getting another Creative)!
2,GOOD THINGS DON'T COME IN SMALL PACKAGES,PROS:GOOD SOUNDEASY DOWNLOADING FROM CDCHARGE IN CAR WITH RAZR(CELL PHONE)PLUGCONS:NO ON/OFF INDICATOR-NO WARNING THAT BATTERY IS DYINGDIFFICULT TO SEE READOUTSARMBAND IS UNCOMFORTABLE AND MUST BE REMOVED TO CHANGE SETTINGSI PLACED MINE IN THE GARBAGE YESTERDAY AND FELT A WAVE OF RELIEF IMMEDIATELY.
2,Is it an ipod??????,You need to install a sony software to upload and dowload music. I didn't liked it.
1,"Hard to use, low battery life, just average sound","The title says it all, cheap headphones, wimp of a battery, difficulty in loading and actual use, and average sound makes this puppy a bad investment."
3,Jim MP3 Player,My husband loves it he can go running and listen to his music without have anything in his hands to hold.
3,"Decent, not great","I bought this for the water-resistant function (rain killed my other mp3 player) and the price. After a few weeks, here are my experiences:- I prefer belt clip to arm band; band and the length of player can chafe some. Not alot but noticeable - probably a personal preference.- No off button is frustrating. Seems to die in my gym bag.- Sony software is a pain. No drag-and-drop directly into folder like other players.- Controlling player while running is easy ONLY if you are just skipping songs. Otherwise, you have to stop, take off the band and muddle your way through to perform other functions.- Charging via USB adds extra hassle, vs. simple battery.Overall, once it's loaded, strapped on, and playing, it sounds good while exercising. And it's easy to skip song. BUT getting there is a bit of pain."
4,Great Product !!,"This product excelled as my music device for the gym, expecially being water resistant as i sweat alot.Volume , software, Fm radio, nothing was a problem, worked great.Problem was it died about after a years use. I did use it regularly but i think the memory got corrupted, it could have been me just ejecting it when the comp was still accessing i duno, but i was peeved.Also virtually no support acessory wise. If ur arm band is busted or old and nasty, no way to replace it with ease, or in a timely fashion. Have to call sony and pay mula. lameBut all in all i was satisfied. would have bought again cept for the allure of the new ipods lol. I have gen 3 nano now .. and its considerably bulkier and heavier.Recap Gym use Sony winsHome, starbucks, casual use, nano~."
4,Don't Disappointed,The NW-S203F is a very good music player with good sound quality and very comfortable to wear when exercising. I really feel it was a very good buy and would recommend it.
5,Great Player,Great player for people who exercise. The use and sound are great and the SonicStage software is easy to use. The people that are complaining about the software either shouldn't own new-age electronics or should become more software savvy before using it because I had it up and running in seconds. You have to be smarter than the equipment you're operating!
4,Some great Gym/running specific features,I bought this to use in the gym. I was pleased with the sound quality. I found the sound quality not as good as my iriver but better than my ipod. This has a great little feature that changes the play list to slower or faster paced music depending on your pace. The music change sometimes gave me a little push to continue my workout if for some reason I had wimped out early. You could also change music by giving it a shake. It did require a learning curve and I hadn't figured out all the features before I was given an ipod for Christmas. I didn't have issues with the software but I was using Windows XP. I sold mine but I admit that I do miss some of the features when I use my ipod at the gym.
3,A View From the Porch,"I found this book to be a lesson for all of us to learn. The journey that was made was one we all have to take at one time or another. This author has made the journey easy for all of us to understand. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I know this author must have taken this journey, because she writes so knowledgeable about it. If only we all lived by this, what a world we would live in. Great job, keep up the good work."
3,Lousy attach sytem...,"The pads have goog quality but the a very poor system to attached them to the bars, once I get my surfboards on the rack and I enter a dirt road I realize that it's very hard for the pad to stay in one position and it rotates around the bar, if the road gets too bumpy the pads go upside down and the boards end up directly to the bars. To solve this you have to tight them with several plastic ties."
5,SIGMOND ROMBERG,"FANTASTIC, THE SINGING IS WONDERFUL I LIKED IT BETTER THAN MARIO LANZA'S VERSION. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE GORDON MACRAE HAS, ALSO DORTHEY KIRSTEN. I RECCOMEND THIS ALBUM MOST HEARTEDLY. I RATE IT FIVE STARS."
4,Excelent,I realy loved the film it made me laugh all the way threw if your looking for a laugh then this is the write film 4 uUnit
3,My Place in Space,"This used book was listed as ""like new"" but it really wasn't in very good shape. The pages were torn then taped and several pages were folded in several places."
3,Destinos,It arrived in a very timely fashion and exactly as reported in the description - I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks!
1,I was very unimpressed with this book.,"I never felt fully prepared to take exams or any sort of related activity upon reading the book . I often felt lost and out of place when viewing the book and feel that it should be made more clear. I don;t know exactly what your objectives should be, however, let me make it clear to you that there are individuals struggling to keep up in class because they are confused by the combination of your book and the actual text."
4,A history for Arizona,"Beautiful deserts and hyper-modern cities. Arizona has a lot going for it, and this book will show you and your students what.The ""Portrait of America"" series is a great and easy to understand introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. This ""Arizona"" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like ""History"", ""Culture"", ""Economy"" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. My only reservation is that the History section should have focused more attention on the ancient civilizations that flourished on the deserts over the centuries.This book, as well as the entire ""Portrait of America"" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."
4,An interesting book on the nation of Israel.,This is a smaller book on modern Israel and how prophecy fromscripture played into it's emergence. It's a good book.
5,Ankle Brace,"My daughter plays softball and basketball and we have tried many braces for her ankles. This one she liked from day one and I ordered another for her other ankle. Gives her great support, I would definitely recommend this brace. Shipping was very fast."
1,"Received Different Brand, Supports not rigid","The product delivered was not a Pro-Tec brand but instead a Swede-O.The stirrups are not made of Dupont Surlyn, but of an unknown plastic (If you're going to advertise the material a product is made from, it should actually be that).I am not sure if the Pro-Tec would be any more rigid, but I can easily flex the SWEDE-O brace from side to side in my hands with little pressure. If I can do that with my hands, how will the stirrups offer any added protection from rolling my ankle while running?I will be returning this."
1,was sent different brand,I ordered this brace because I have just gotten off crutches after a serious sprain. I was thrilled when it was delivered a mere 2 days after I ordered it. The brace I was sent was manufactured by a company called Swede-O. My fault with this product is that I trust the Pro-Tec company name and order their brand of protective gear and have never been unsatisfied with the quality.I do not like being misled and not being given the product I ordered.
4,"Crafted, not just written, suspense.","Gilman can write. Her protagonist, Amelia Jones, is a real person, with a history beyond the front cover of the book. That history is revealed slowly, in fact Amelia doesn't realise how much is revealed, during the course of the story; gradually the reader is drawn into her life as much as her search for a past murder, victim, and murderer(s), until knowing that Amelia is growing and maturing greatly is perhaps more important than knowing that the evil ones will be brought to justice. The only downside to the book is that there is a simply wonderful book ""The Maze in the Heart of the Castle"" central to both the plot and Amelia's character; i want to read that book, but Gilman invented it and its sequel without writing them. Very unfair of her, i thought."
4,Tightrope Walker,Book was in excellent condition. Enoyed the story and moral suggestions that Gilman is so famous for.
4,"""They're going to kill me soon...""","A note found in a old hurdy-gurdy (barrel organ) leads a young woman on a search for answers about its author and finds more than she bargained for. Another excellent tale of self-development with a backdrop of small town life and painted in sharp colors of good & evil. Just enough suspense to keep it interesting. If you liked 'Uncertain Voyage', you'll like this one, too."
2,ehhh,"This didn't satisfy my needs. I didn't like the setup, not very ""user friendly"". I got my money back from Intuit within 30 days."
5,It is the best software to have if you have quickbooks system,I have quicken and i tansfer my file and folder with this it seems is good software to have
1,Buy Mini Radio with Digital Tuning,"You get what you pay for. This is a sorry excuse for a mini radio. Tuning is awkward,won't stay on station, poor reception. Pay $15 more and get a Sony Walkman with digital tuning and lock feature."
5,excellent beginning dictionary with clear colorful pictures,"As a kindergarten teacher, I am always looking for very simple reference books which will teach even the youngest students how to locate and use information. This dictionary does exactly that.I have many copies of the book and they are used hard and often on a daily basis in my kindergarten classroom."
3,good but too old,"it is very cheap. so I bought this. but too old.&#12640;.&#12640; if I buy another one, I'll buy new one."
5,I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!,"Sue Harrison gains five stars and then some in her novel Mother Earth Father Sky. She has out done even Jean Auel. Mother Earth Father Sky has a realistic style of writing that The Clan of the Cave Bear sometimes lacks.Sue's novel is incredibly well reserched down to every word. This novel is enthralling and even poetic to the end.I recomend this to all readers, but heed my warning, you will not be able to put it down!"
4,Motherhood Remembered,"Spellbound with magnitude. First Man revered their children. Mothers had joy and laughter and work, companionship, hardship, sheer terror. But the strong undercurrent of this novel struck me as these mothers were basically prolife, with reverence to the spiritual world around them, they desired long life for their offspring, so that they might become the best at their different talents and personalities. Even the harmony of those living with neighbors not so 'nice'.The first to read in this series, only recently did finished, I couldn't wait to read the second. And now onto the third of your first series. Never knew of their existence until Nov, 1999, now I want to read all of your books. Sue, you have a wonderful way with stories. Thank you for the work you are doing. I am most thankful that Storytellers are still among us."
1,Wrong advertised listing by seller,"As this add shows, it was for the three book series; It was to include Mother Earth Father Sky, My Sister the Moon and Brother Wind. What I received was only one book, which was Mother Earth Father Sky. This makes the second time ordering from a British bookseller through Amazon.com. I alerted Amazon to this purchase and to the first purchase. They refunded the first purchase but to date no action on the second.As far as the book review is concerned, It is a Sue Harrison novel and she is an excellent author for writing anhistorical fiction novel. I give her a ""thumbs up"" for an interesting read."
4,Struggles of a woman,"Chagak, a young girl living through the struggles that were very difficult for her. A strong character is what pulled through, the presence of Kayugh made her rethink. Wanting yet afraid that all might be lost again. Love grew and transformed her as you will read in the next novel, My Sister Moon.Moved me, with all her emotions. A truly enthralling novel with the descriptions of the situations and traditions."
5,Packed with Emotion and Adventure! I love it!,"Mother Earth, Father Sky by Sue Harrison is a very good book!It starts out with Chagak, and she has a really hard time with everything!She just keeps losing everything she loves!I'm not going to say too much more though, or I might spoil the surprises!It's a great book and I recommend you buy it, read it, and review it!This book is defineitley for readers who love prehistoric times, emotion, and adventure!Any questions, comments, etc.? E-mail me at AshleyAACK@hotmail.comThis book is a great read!"
5,Great Product,"We purchased these set of hands to go along with a prop for an Alien we made. The Alien was made using an actual Alien mask. The hands were made to compliment the prop. The hands worked, and are, great. They compliment the mask quite well. The hands are large, and menacing. You could wear them as a costume item. Regardless you won't be disappointed.Made from semi rigid plastic, they stuffed well and worked great for us."
2,Fun to Watch After All These Years,"I remember going to the show to see this movie and I was about 13 years old. I don't know how I managed to get in to see it. I just remember it is what made me love Harley's. I also remember loving their ""free"" lifestyle. But after watching again I asked myself ""what was I thinking?"". At least about how violent some of it was. After all, I told my husband I wanted him to watch this movie because it is what made me want to become a ""biker"". But as far as the Harley goes, we have had one for years and ride every weekend, take cross country trips, ride with friends, do charity rides, etc. But it was fun watching the movie again. Of course it was very dated and a little cheesy, but a lot of old movies are."
3,This one should be re-released pronto!,"This Roger Corman (director) film is a mid-60s camp classic that features Peter Fonda in pre-Easy Rider mode as a reluctant outlaw biker. Even better is the massively talented Nancy Sinatra as his girlfriend who gets to deliver the classic line: ""Does anyone have a straight cigarette?"" She really does look like a waitress in a pizza joint in this one. Joe Bob Briggs should show this one on Monstervision -- he'd have a field day!"
3,Ends bizarrely/too quickly,"Bought this for a trip in the past because I remember my brother buying and playing the 33 rpm vinyl of the sound track just after the film was released 40 yrs ago; soundtrack contained motorcycle revving sounds mixed with the music. Was too young then to attend viewing of such a movie with sex, drugs and violence. Worth its price for the 'trip' to the past it allows. The oasis partying is interesting; wonder where this scene was filmed. Looks like a low budget-amateurish movie at times."
3,Do you want to be free?,We want to be free! We want to be free to do what we want to do! We want to be free to ride. And we want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by The Man. And we want to get loaded. And we want to have a good time! And that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna have a good time. We're gonna have a party!60's alternative cinema and a pretty big hit 40 years ago. Poorly acted. But campy fun.
3,CheeseFest '66,"""The Wild Angels"" is no ""Easy Rider."" TWA is chock full of bad acting, bad dialogue, badly-delivered dialogue, and more teased hair than you can shake a can of Aqua Net Extra Super Hold at. Three stars for numerous and unintentionally funny scenes that reek of every biker cliche imaginable. I became interested in the genre after reading Joan Didion's analysis of biker movies in ""Notes Toward a Dreampolitik,"" but I must say I'm pretty much over it now."
4,Wild Angels DVD,DVD was shipped quickly. I was amazed to find this movie from 1966 on DVD and in such great recording quality.
3,The Wild Angels,"The purchase and delivery time was fine. The inside case center that holds the DVD was broken in three places. The DVD was all over the place with lots of what looks like scratches, but the movie played without skipping. This always seems to happen at shipping time. Don't think I'll purchase DVD's via mail anymore. It's the third time in a row this happened, three different shippers too."
2,THE WILD ANGELS,"THIS IS THE PETER FONDA MOVIE BEFORE EASYRIDER,IT IS LOOSLEY BASED ON THE ADVENTURES OF THE RED AND WHITE IN THE 60'S ITS ONE OF THE VERY FEW MOVIES THAT NANCY SINATRA WAS IN(THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING FAME)AND ALSO STARS BRUCE DERN, IT'S OKAY BUT NOTHING TO RIGHT HOME ABOUT."
2,Motor Sensation: What a Bad Vibration!,"The initial motorbike flick, directed by Roger Corman, features two of Hollywood's papa's bad children (Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra), in a gross, tasteless showcase of sensationalism, that it has, however, a merit for its audacy, that both disgusted and attracted audiences at its time.It has some interest as a time capsule and for its attractive stars, but The Wild Angels is not even a good-bad movie. Today it looks as a piece of old-fashioned trash, so ugly as terribly boring.If you like this kind of films, when everybody is sexist, violent and ultimately silly, as a certain (and wronged) notion of nihilism, it's all right, but you're warned."
4,First Real Outlaw Biker Flick,"Some folks consider ""The Wild One"" the first movie about outlaw bikers; it's not. ""The Wild One"" is about 50s beatniks who happen to tool around on British bikes (except Lee Marvin, the best thing about the movie). If you want the real thing, Hells Angels on Harleys, then ""The Wild Angels"" is the one. This is the movie that started the genre, so most of the cliches seen in subsequent drive in picture show biker features started here."
3,don't take it too seriously,"Its a good old Biker flick with cool bikes and scenery if you just kick back with a 12 pack, ""get loaded"" , and enjoy it. Like the ""Wild One"", the star(Peter Fonda) is not actually the best. Bruce Dern makes the Movie."
1,Stupid,Definitely not my type of movie. My husband wanted it; he even laughed through it. Too corny. Waste of time.
3,handle design?,"This winch works OK for pulling my 19' skiff onto the trailer but the zinc plating is not sufficient for salt water; already starting to rust. The quick release handle is great as long as you remember to remove and secure it, well unfortunately I forgot to do that and when I returned from fishing the crank handle had been stolen and left me with a challenge getting the boat onto the trailer. This time I am going for a galvanized winch with a fixed handle."
5,Fan from the Beginning,"I have been a fan since 1979. This was a great album showcasing Terri Nunn's versatility and range, not to mention Babe Factor :) Great album indicative of what was fun and exciting about the 80's."
4,terri nunn,"berlin would not be berlin without the sultry voice of terri nunn.though at the time of her debut, blondie were at there height. therefore not getting the nod buy mainstream media as a true 80's rock band... not until 'topgun'came out, did terri get her due credit. this fan will allways enjoy her strong, yet passionate voice. i suggest if your going to purchase a berlin cd, then the 'greatest hits' cd is a better choice, due to its a credit to her vocal talent ....bruce"
2,Boring New Wave/Disco/Techno Pop,"Berlin is one of those female-fronted new wave bands of the early eighties, very similar to the Motels and Missing Persons. None of these bands had a long life. Thier lifespan was that of the musical genre, which kind of evolved from punk and finally blended into disco. Berlin probably had the shortest and the longest life span of any of these groups. They released one EP, two LP's, disbanded and have reappeared from time to time.Berlin's first output was the fantastic EP, Pleasure Victim. This was a shining example of what New Wave music could be. This second effort, Love Life, was a prime example of what New Wave generated into as it got more popular and started to blend with Disco. Short, pop-flavored love songs backed by an electronic beat. There is absolutely nothing interesting or memorable here."
1,"Qep 24""","This tool looks good on pictures, but it is very bulky.Instructions for putting it to work are almost useless.The blade is very hard to center due to a slightly smallershaft that has no seat for the 5/8"" hole in the blade.The motor appears to be much less powerful then it should be.It is very common in Chinese made machines like this.When I wanted to use the saw the first time, it was breaking the stone.This was due to the blade being out of center.I took out my 14"" brick saw and got the job done.Next day I returned the new saw."
3,QEP Customer support to be desired,"Saw itself is easy enough to set up and use.PROBLEM with the saw is the supplied pump if put in the spot upright where its suppose to be,the fitting and hose stick up too high so the carriage wont move all the way forward to cut a complete tile.I sent QEP a email the day after i had the problem (about 3 plus weeks) and never heard back.the only way to use pump is in the back and it still kinks hose badly.Amazon did a great job and i have no complaints with them.If cutting porcelain i would swap out blade.worked but slow.I also complained about breaking porcelain tiles to them too. I have to buy a new pump now that will work in the unit so beware of that.saw is pretty good though.Dissapointed tho and will buy MK next time."
4,Good Value for DIY Tile and Masonry Saw,"This saw is good enough for an advance DIY to do tile and brick work.If you are only doing tile work, I would suggest getting something smaller that is better for the smaller tile cutsI originally bought it to do pavers as it was cheaper to buy the saw than rent one for my job.Later I have used the saw for bathroom tile work.And I had no chipout with the stock blade and I was happy with its durabilityNow I give it four stars because I did have to replace the water pump already and it is challenging to calibrate.Having said this I will say was accurate in doing repetitive and miter cuts as frame is very sturdy.One could ask why not 3 stars given this and I would say it was good enough to get the job done and much cheaper than a rental.And I just didn't this it was fair to ding an low cost DIY saw for not being as good as saws 2x-3X more expensive."
2,Comfortable while it lasts,"I've had this Aerobed Premier DuraSuede Air Mattress for just over a year. It got used once a week, on average. It was (and is) comfortable. However, it now has a slow leak, which means it doesn't stay inflated for an entire night. My understanding is that it has a one-year warranty. One reviewer also reported his mattress developed a leak just after the warranty expired. Ironically, it looks very well constructed. From other reviews, it appears there is a leakage/ballooning problem with the product (though mine exhibited no ballooning). It is said in one of the reviews that the pump has a 3-yr warranty. Had the mattress lasted that long, I'd have given the mattress a 4-star rating. It fills and empties very quickly, is quite comfortable, and ""folds"" up nicely. But its durability--the very thing you buy it for--is questionable."
4,Extra bed space,"There are lots of imitations of the Aerobeds out there but this one has worked for us without any issues for a few years now. We have used it on its own on the floor and once we got some bed frames at the cottage we used it for guests until we got new mattresses. I find it comfortable although some find sleeping on air to be ""hard"" or firm. I'm happy with no leaks so far."
3,Durabed review,"This was a very firm bed. It almost felt like laying on card board. So I sent it back next day and got another Aerobed that was much softer. The bed looked durable and felt durable but it's not something you can sleep on a day to day basis. I received the new product fairly quick but it was bad communication between UPS and the company. Other than the delivery issue, I only recommend this product if you like sleeping on very firm mattresses."
4,Guests are happy to sleep on it,"I bought this because every year my husband and I have friends/guests stay with us. The built-in motor inflated and deflated the mattress very quickly. The faux-suede flocking on the mattress is nice because it isn't as bone-chilling as plastic. On it's maiden voyage, our guests told us it was the best air mattress they'd slept on. And the ability to quickly adjust the air pressure inside allows people to customize it for their comfort. I recommend this product for short-term visits."
1,Terrible,"Slept on this bed one night, couldn't wait to get out of it. Definitely not recommended. Only gave it 1 star because zero stars is not an option."
1,Aerobed Premier duraSuede,I have two earlier Aerobeds and they are very comfortable and conforms to support our bodies. This new Premier DuraSuede is like lying on a sheet of tin. The material is so stiff it does not conform to our body. I find it unusable.
4,Decent but a little expensive,We got these for our Thule roof racks. We park in not so great neighborhoods so I wanted the extra security. Pro: they do lock well. They come with an extra lock cylinder. Con: if you don't lock them correctly and push them in all the way they fall out so we lost one first time we drove with them on.Overall good product. Would buy again.
5,Quality product,These locks easly fit into your Thule rack. Installation takes seconds. You have to love Thule quality.
5,Thule lock,Bought it as price finally went down similar to use one seen on Craiglist. A must if you valuable items in your cargo box.
5,Thule locks,"Thule 596 replacement locks work like a charm! Easy to install, nice and secure. Keys fit locks with no snags."
1,Truly Awful,"This is an excerpt from a concert at Chastain Park (Atlanta, GA) in 1985. The total running time is 33 minutes, and the artist biography is two pages of text.The video is fuzzy, the editing is lousy (the first track is cut after two minutes), there are no segues, the camera work is jerky, and parts of the performance look like they were phoned in.This DVD is a disservice to the legendary showman and GFOS. Spend a little more and get a full concert."
5,Full Miles,"If you need an introduction to Miles Davis, this is the package to purchase. It gives you a taste of Miles from all directions of his career. Nothing better than this!"
4,Smell fresh,Don't know if this is what Irish smells like in the spring but it does smell good. Helps wake you up in the morning after waking up. It didn't dry out my skin any and the wife liked it just as well.
3,Don't go to STORES...There's people there.,"This soap is great. I love this soap. It feels good against a body, I'll tell you that. And I'll also tell you that it's gentle. The kind of gentle that says: ""I know you have saddle-rash from that horse yesterday, but I can smooth that out."" Whatta soap. You can't find that kind of quality in stores.No, soap is best when bought online, and with the least amount of human contact possible. So don't go to the stores, you shut-ins, place an order for a bar of these babies, and shudder at the thought of meeting a stranger..."
3,repair book,"the content of the book had some good tips, the shape of the book worse than promised with scribble and dirt marks all over. I was disappointed."
5,Great candy and price!!!,I just love this candy I remember eating these when I was A child. And this is the first time i've come across these in years. The price is right and the taste is the same good and chewy just how I remember.
3,"Good texture, ok value, taste not strong enough","I bit into this expecting it to taste like coke, but it really has a vague taste, and if you didn't tell me the flavor of it, i wouldn't have guessed it.but like all haribo gummies, the texture is very good."
2,i learned my lesson...,"i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i'd give this a try. These are gross... not only that, but they're huge. i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative. Now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first,before investing in my next 5 pound bag. 2 stars because well it's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible, but still, now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of."
1,I can't imagine that this is a healthy approach,"You don't need a medical background to know that a healthy lifestyle will prevent heart disease and help reverse it if you already have it. One of the reviewers praised this book because it doesn't focus on diet, but having a healthy diet is good for the heart. I am always supicious of ""quick-fix"" approaches to complicated problems and this book falls into that category. I think we are far too quick to rush to instant solutions instead of doing the hard work we need to do in order to maintain our health and correct our problems. Who knows what information will come out about statin drugs in the future, just like doctors are now worried about resistance to antibiotics because antibiotics have been so overused. Old-fashioned approaches like diet and exercise should be the foundation of a heart program. Then if that doesn't work, maybe you need medicine."
5,Delightful and Entertaining,"How do you immediately engage students in learning about the Japanese culture and its people? A good start would be to have and read with the students, TOKYO FRIENDS. For over 30 years I have taught third and fourth graders at Germantown Friends School and used this delightful book to educate the students about the similarities and differences between the Japanese and American cultures. I have lived in Tokyo and am Japanese American. I find the text and illustrations to be true to experiencing Japan and its people. The lively and colorful illustrations make learning fun and enjoyable. Soon they want to learn more about the traditions of speaking, eating, and joining in the meaningful festivals. I wholeheartedly endorse this book and encourage everyone to add it to their libraries.-Teresa Maebori"
5,Inflatable boat motor mount,The motor mount was delivered within a few days after I ordered it and I am satisfied with the quality of the product and the price.
3,a must-have,You have to have a mount for any inflatable boat. But when I used it the bracket on the side broke and now it isnt securely on there anymore. Tried to call for a replacement part and haven't heard back for sevylor. I wouldn't recommend this product. Make your own mount or buy and fix this one to make a better quality item.
3,It is work but not perfect,It is good to fit the fish hunter boat but take time to install it. Overall it is good and working.
2,Screw Loose,Noticed this is a recurring issue with this product. Plastic bracket that secures the telescoping rods broke our on our first voyage while in the middle of the lake. Trying now to jury rig a solution.Sevylor boat is great -- the motor mount is not.Hey Sevylor: any suggestions as to how to fix this?
1,Doesn't work with Intex Inflatable boat,The info page says this will work on the 2009 Intex Mariner 4 Person Inflatable Boat made by Intex. It does not!
2,"Works okay, hard to attach, a little overpriced","I am using this motor mount on a Sevylor Fish Ranger FT280 raft. It's very difficult to insert the mount posts into the designated slots on the raft, I end up spending 15-20 minutes of setup time fighting with it. Instead of relying on the friction, I wish the mount just slipped on and locked down via separate clamps. Once it's attached, it works fine as a mount - I am using a Minn Kota Endura 40, and I've had no problems with it over the past 2 years."
1,Ron,"I just purchased the Sevylor Motor mount and couldn't believe what I found. Nothing fits ! I just purchased a Sevylor Fish finder 4-person HF 280 boat and was intending to mount a 38lb thrust Minn Kota trolling motor. First of all, the telescoping bars are too big to fit into the holes on the oar locks. Secondly, the bars holding the transom board are too large to fit into the motor mounts on the back of the boat. Its a complete failure. I have tried to contact Sevylor, but no response. Do not purchase the Sevylor motor mount. Don't know what the engineer was thinking when this was designed. Its a joke. I am returning the mount to get my money back."
5,Rip roaring classic speed metal from the loudest band,"Simply put, this is the classic speed metal live album ever! The 3 man line up of Ian ""Lemmy a fiver"" Kilmister, ""Fast Eddie"" Clark & Phil""thy"" ""Animal"" Taylor deliver the goods from the opening note. Motorhead rips through its set starting off with Ace of spades, played even faster than the studio version. Lemmy's gravelly voice & dirty bass sound never let down with Clark's riffs & Taylor's speedy drumming as they continue through ""Stay clean"", ""metropolis"", ""the hammer"", all the way thru to closing the set with a version of ""Train kept a' rollin'"" that'll have you headbanging forever! Buy this album."
1,Too Tight for regular sized hands,"These gloves are so tight, even my daughters thin hands could not fit in them. It is ridiculous that the company Grandoe only gives you thirty days to make the return. If you travel with your gifts like I do...you won't be able to send them back within the short timeframe. So I'm stuck with gloves I can't wear. If you purchase these....don't trust your hand width....go up a size beyond that to make sure they fit. Or better yet, don't buy them at all."
2,Stacking Blocks,Not really pleased with this purchase. The wood is already breaking at the edges. Thought this would be a better purchase than the cardboard stacking blocks-it wasn't. It does have a cute design on the blocks
5,1999 Dallas Stars VHS,Great movie about the glorious year of 1999 in Dallas Stars hockey. This has been something nice to watch while waiting for this stupid lockout to end.
1,Please don't use antibacterial soap -- even the FDA questions their use!,"Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a *huge* problem in this country. Antibacterial soaps have been conclusively found to be no more effective at killing germs than plain old soap and water. There is great concern about increasing resistance due to the widespread use of these products in everything from hand soap to toothpaste to tile cleaner. Even the FDA called them into quesiton this fall -- Google ""FDA antibacterial soap"" for lots of information. Please -- for the sake of your children, your elderly parents, and mine, don't fall for the manipulative advertising that leads you to think these products make your family safer -- the opposite is the truth. (rated a 1 only because I had to rate it something)"
5,Honesty,I am very happy with my purchase. The seller wasn't sure if I had been informed that the book had a scribble on inside cover so she discounted the price 30%. I think that is very admirable and honest. I am pleased and astonished at the same time. Rare to find this kind of pleasure anymore. It was even sent and received in a very timely manner. Thanks go to my seller. Charlette
3,"Good Instruction, So-So Designs","Great step-by-step instruction manual on various appliqué methods, but I found the designs for the lessons to be uninspiring. Nothing jumped out and screamed ""Make-Me, Make-Me"".The book has twelve lessons including: Cutwork Applique and the Tack Stitch, Onliad Cutwork Applique, Inlaid Cutwork Applique, Straight-edge Applique, Unit Cutowrk with Folded Fabric Flowers, Interrupted Cutwork, Stuffed Applique, and Mixed Applique techniques. The book also has 27 patterns, and a 16 page color section with the lesson blocks and finished examples of contemporary and classic Baltimore Quilts."
4,applique and quilting,Great book for learning the basics of a Baltimore Album Quilt in 12 lessons. Try the companion books of patterns by Elly also. This book begins slowly and continues to make you want to do more and more appliqueing.
3,accidental death due to drowning?,"Despite much badgering, the Sheriff of Collinsport makes his report to the coroner regarding the mysterious death of Bill Malloy. And the coroner then makes a decision about whether he considers it a homicide.This decision relieves some people and profoundly irritates others. But then, Victoria Winters finds a clue on the beach which may cause the Sheriff to reconsider his findings..."
2,This fell far below expectations,I remember reading reviews for this product and thought- great my child will love it. She likes toys that make music and flash lights. What a disappointment!! She could care less about the wings that turn and doesn't really seem interested in the lights or songs. And it seems like the same songs and words are playing (driving me and my husband crazy). Most of the time I can find her chewing the green suction cup on the bottom of this toy (the suction NEVER sticks). For what we paid for this toy it is NOT worth it.
2,not that great,"Well,for me, the thumb hole was too small (I am a small boned female-ring finger size 5); I had to remove the inside rubber ring. Scissors didn't cut well either. I suppose they'll be good for other things; just not hair. Disappointed."
4,A good read,"I have expected a Faith and Walker book since the Jade Island book in this series. This book continues the series of the Donovan family, their favotite jewels, the government and organized crime. The entire series is a must read. Midnight in Ruby Bayou by Elizabeth Lowell is one of the few books for which I will pay hardback price."
4,The Donovans are still exciting,"Ms. Lowell hits the mark again in her latest installment of this popular family. Since there are only two siblings left to write about, I am fearful that there will less adventures to explore. Faith, the character in the newest book is a character that was thought to be a weakling in the previous books, but I was glad to find out that she was just a woman who yearns for the happiness that her other siblings have. She is strong, smart, and refuses to let past failures stand in her way of finding real happiness. Owen is not bad as her man of choice. He is just as strong as her brothers."
5,Midnight in Ruby Bayou is great,"I could not put the book down, I read it in two days. ITs great ! Hope her next book comes out fast."
4,Ruby Bayou,"Midnight in Ruby Bayou follows in the tradition of the Donovan Family. Younger sister Faith finally meets her romantic match in Donovan International troubleshooter, Owen Walker. Very entertaining, Faith is asked to design a wedding present for her college roommate, who is marrying into the Montague. This book is a fast-paced look at the Montague family's troubled history with beautiful Burmese's rubies and skeletons in the closet. Faith and Owen are forced to run the gauntlet to save a ruby treasure in time to avert and international incident, while contending with the Russian mafiya, and family's destructiveness. A completely entertaining read, this book is a great addition to the Donovan family series, but may at times appear short on detail."
2,Not so pleased,"I am a huge Elizabeth Lowell fan and have read all of the other books in the Donovan series and this was my least favorite. I don't feel there was as much intensity as in the others; Too many bad guys, not enough romance. However, I do look forward to reading about Justin and Lawe Donovan!"
3,Donovans again! :),"Ok I read the first three books in Lowell's Donovan series, the second two once I discovbered there _were_ more. All in all enjoyable books. I particularly liked Jade Island. This installment (for it is becoming installments) concerns Faith Donovan, and Owen Walker. Yes the same Owen Walker from Jade Island whom I rather enjoyed his camoe appearance.As far as the story went it was well developed for Owen Walker.. Faith Donovan's character was a little less ah.. deep. But that isn't too surprising.. Lowell's men are always more thought out than her female characters.The plot was the usual- mystery surrounding some form of precious stone. I enjoyed the process of getting to the end but I have to say it was not as thrilling or intriguing as the earlier three books. There was more reach.. and the ever present April Joy was back. Do we detect foreshadowing?A good read but not on the level of the first two... or even the third. Recommended but not strongly."
5,Great Read!,If you enjoyed the previous Donovan's - you will also enjoy this story. Well written and a continuous read. Didn't want to put down. Have enjoyed all of Elizabeth Lowell's books and found this book to be no different. Can't wait to read the next book.
3,Midnight in Ruby Bayou,"Faith Donovan had immersed herself into the creation of exquisite jewelry since the breakup of a disappointing relationship. An important commission has come her way, and now Faith must see to it that she obtain rubies of the highest quality. That quality comes with a very high price. Owen Walker knows what that price is but won't tell her for her own sake. Faith suspects Owen may be hiding a secret, but would that secret come at the expense of her very life? This reviewer, and perhaps the audience, has come to expect more from Elizabeth Lowell. There's also more information about the geology and precise mathematical cutting of rubies than there is romantic suspense. The big disappointment comes when we find the previous books in the Donovan series superior to this letdown of a conclusion."
3,"Not bad, not really good","Although not as bad as many novels I have read, I felt that Midnight in Ruby Bayou lacked the pace, character development, action and romance of the previous novels in the Donovan series. Yes, there was some pace, etc., but it was as lacklustre as the plot. Usually a Elizabeth Lowell book is edge-of-seat reading, but this one I found a struggle to finish. What kept me from giving up was the information on the rest of the Donovan family - and this is why I awarded it three stars in the end. Not bad, just not up to Ms Lowell's usual standard."
3,Too many rubies in Ruby Bayou,"Ms. Lowell has written another novel in her series of the wonderful Donovan family. However, this new release had me flipping quickly through all the information on the rubies that are the focus of this installment. The story, slowly, (and I mean slowly), unfurled to a novel that did improve in suspence and characterization. At least, the wonderful Archer made another appearance. That in itself was a saving grace."
3,So-so,"I love Elizabeth Lowell but I've been kind of disappointed with her latest series, this book included. I found myself skimming the pages, which is something I never did with her older, better novels. I'm not saying that she's not a good writer, which she is, but I enjoyed reading her pure romances better than these new ones which focus too much on the factual side of the gems than on the development of the characters and their relationship."
4,A gem of a story. :),"This story centers around Faith Donovan, who, despite a recent bad relationship, seems much more emotionally healthy than her brother Archer (star of Pearl Cove). When she receives a commission to design a necklace for an old friend's wedding, she is thrown into company with Owen Walker, whom she had previously admired from afar.Owen has had an eye on Faith for a while, but she has sworn off men. Plus, she views him as less imposing than her huge brothers. He is able to use this to his advantage, however, as he guards her and her gemstones. No one thinks he could be dangerous, including Faith. Being in her constant company, he finally manages to get her attention--and chemistry takes it from there.Be prepared to get a little weepy at times; although Faith and Owen are fairly normal, tragedy has a tendency to strike around them."
3,Midnight in Ruby Bayou,"""Midnight"" is standard Lowell writing. The author spends a substantial amount of time educating the reader about the history of rubies and the world gem market before digging into the plot, which was predictable to anyone who has read any of the earlier Donovan family novels.The three stars indicate that I enjoyed being updated on the lives of the other Donovans (and hope to see the stories of the two remaining brothers) and enjoyed the book in a general way, while not being terribly impressed by this effort. Unless you are a rabid fan, I would recommend waiting for the paperback...or (though amazon.com won't like this) checking the hardback out at the library."
3,Best of the sappy Donovan series.,"This was a typical lowell/donovan book in a lot of ways. Same super, alpha-male and ""sassy"" outspoken, yet vulnerable female. Same roses and puppies ultra-happy family gatherings. But I liked ""Midnight in Ruby Bayou"" a little better than the rest becuase a few times it actually showed a slightly tarnished side to the Donovan family. subtle jealousies and insecurities that real people might actually have, reared their heads in the donovan clan in this book."
3,Could have been better.,"It took me a week to finish this book. Usually it takes me three days max. The ending was boring, alot of questions were left unanswered and no loose ends were tie. I got the feeling that Ms. Lowell realized that she wrote 300 pgs. of nothing and she had a page cutoff and rushed to the ending. I could have done a better job and I'm no writer."
3,"A Good Read ,A Lousy Reader",I'd never read any of Elizabeth Lowells' work before I bought this audio cassette. I thought her plot moved along well and had a few nice twists. Unfortunately Laurel Merlington has no talent for the various moods and accents required. I first found myself grinding my teeth in discomfort as she mangled the main characters in this book and then wishing I had time to read this as a paperback instead of listening to a deplorable attempt in audio.
3,"Vel--nice soap, but not the product of 20 years ago",My mother always used Vel soap when I was growing up. I was really excited when I found it for sale.This is a different Vel. The smell is not the same. The soap feels different on the skin. This soap is almost translucent. Vel was a very solid white bar that lasted a long time.The soap is very acceptable--it is just not the product of my memory.
3,One Fauré track only,"From the liner notes: ""The recordings ... were made by a device... which can read the paper rolls and when attached to any modern day piano, can reproduce the music from the original 'recording'."" The sound, then, is the sound of the modern concert grand, with the texture and rhythm (don't know about relative volume levels) of the original rolls.There is only one Fauré track--the Pavane, op. 50--and only three Strauss tracks. The notes are completely inadequate: the other tracks are not identified and all titles are in English only (thus Strauss is playing ""On the Silent Forest Path""). Who is Scott playing music by Scott (three tracks)? Who is Laparra playing Laparra (5 tracks)? Grunfeld playing Grunfeld? Salzedo playing Salzedo?"
2,"Helpful, well slightly",For the most part I had already found the majority of info in the book by doing web searches and by connectingw/other sarcoid patients. A lot of the info for support groups and info resources was outdated.
5,PARENTS NEED THIS BOOK,"The Medved's have performed an absolutely huge cultural service in writing this book. The brilliant and wise and refreshingly counter-cultural things they say within its covers should be shouted from every rooftop -- or at least shared enthusiastically at every place where parents gather. Read this book and tell other parents about it. They will thank you, and someday their kids will thank you."
2,"If your a good parent you know this, if your a bad parent you aren't reading this review","This book was at best okay. I agree that it is important to allow children to grow up slowly and preserve their sense of wonder and awe. Most parents will do the best that they can. This book goes over the top with trying to scare you into implimenting its suggestions. I think any engage parent understands most of what this book has to offer(Unfortunately we live in a time where there are a lot of parents that don't engage their children) and deals with it as best they can. It's another call for no more television, blah, blah, blah. Again, I feel that good parents are doing the good things that this book has to offer and the bad parents probably aren't going to even pick up this book. Life goes on"
1,Thank goodness these people aren't my parents,"This is the most frightening book I have read in a long time. The Medveds are raising their children in a completely unrealistic way. For example, they are upset when their seven-year-old daughter asks about menstruation, saying this is a 'bad' thing. They don't allow this same daughter to read anything published after 1960. In another anecdote, they recount how another daughter repeatedly asked a babysitter intrusive and inappropriate questions about her pierced nose - and then blame the babysitter rather than the rude child! Still another problem - they complain about businesses that are open on Sunday, but what other day would a Jewish family have to do the weekly shopping? These parents should be arrested for child abuse. I am by no means a religious person, but tonight I am going to thank God that these people aren't my parents."
1,disapointed.. ;-(,"should have been informed that the dvd was in black&white; And was from 1959-1961.... I was Very disapointed! ;-( because i tought it was part of the cops series, and not stories from a lawyer from 1959....VERY disapointed!!! It was at least cheap, or else I would returned it."
5,Excellent game!,"Excellent turn-based, hex-based war game. Very easy to learn and understand, but hard to master. Because the mechanics are so simple (for example, artillery simply 'shifts' the odds) you can really focus on your strategy. It seems like I've played every game of this type going back to Apple II days, and this is the best."
3,A solid old fashioned war game...,"A solid old fashioned war game with a couple of innovative features. One of its best features is that it seems more approachable than many of the other games in the genre. Very much like the old board games in style of play and overall appearance. Comes with a free updated version of one of the earlier titles in the series. If you are a war gamer or think you are a potential war gamer, you might want to have a look at this game. It's a good introduction to the level of war gaming that begins beyond beer and pretzels but stops short of ""you're going to need a year or two at the army or navy war college in order to master this baby"" that some of the offerings in the genre tend to demand. Also, you might want to shop around some more for it. The asking price (s) here is (are) much too high. Remember, Google is your friend."
3,Probably not the best didgeridoo CD out there,"I kind of got tired of looking for a didgeridoo music CD and bought this one in haste. It has a nice clear sound to it and variety of tunes, but isn't exactly what I was looking for. All it is is didgeridoo. I wanted something with a few more instruments and a little bit of a modern sound. Maybe a CD with a mix of Australian sounding music (bush tunes, country, and didgeridoo). Any suggestions?"
4,A Classic Gem,"One of the great Aussie albums of all time. Great playing, great vocals by Matt. (Taken from us way too soon).Three tracks are worth the price of admission alone. Look At Me, Short Note, and Mancini Shuffle. When I play this album, people say: ""Oh..... I know this band"" without really knowing them. A real gem."
4,Awesome,"One of the best books covering Santa Fe engine development as far as I'm concerned. Very good, classic images, all well shot."
1,Useless,"I bought a Student Solution Manual in the hopes that it would contain solutions that supplement the text. However, this book only contains the same solutions that are in the text, the only difference being explanation is provided on a few of the problems for each chapter (usually the more involved ones). If you are looking for solutions to check your work for the even problems, this will not help you."
5,SHAKES YOUR BOOTIE!!!,"This CD has been the hit of every party, every road trip, and every dull day at the office. This is a must have -- I'm ordering it for all of my funky friends this holiday season!"
5,All of the episodes,It's very funny the first episode is these two gilrs (that look like shampoo in ranma ) They battel Inverse to get the book.The seconmd one is so cute Zelgadis is great as a bunny heheheThe third one is cool because swallos is awesome and crule:)
4,Extremely Funny,"Slayers is great and the 2nd series is just as good! Lots of action and comedy from our favorite sorceress with a bad temper and huge appetite. Very good if you don't mind that most of the episodes start/involve food, lots of food. A great anime!"
4,a bit outdated,"great deal for three-books-in one. was a little disappointed how much of it is outdated considering prophesies of future events which have recently taken place.nevertheless, an excellent reference book for Bible Study concerning a Christian perspective towards the End Times."
5,get ready,"if you're lost...read, read, read, then pray...get found and saved. don'tmiss out on the only thing we were put here for....to be God's children and praise Him."
1,Wow...,".... you can get all three of these wacky books in one neat volume! Doesn't this hurt the bottom line at Hagee Ministries? What, has the pool of his mesmerized followers begun to dry up? It reminds me of when the band, KISS (aka Kings In Satan's Service) re-packaged their first three albums as ""The Originals."" At least in that case you had an extra track of ""Rock and Roll All Nite"", assuming you already had the album ""Dressed To Kill."" On the other hand, maybe Hagee Ministries was using the KISS model, assuming that it wouldn't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy, compact volume of fear."
2,Has Turtledove Finally Run Out Of Ideas?,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Ever since reading the Misplaced Legion books, I've been a big Turtledove fan. Unfortunately, it seems like he's finally hit a wall. Into the Darkness is mediocre, at best. The problem may be that Turtledove is currently in the middle of three different trilogies. It may be that after 20 or so books, he's running out of original things to say. Whatever the reason, this book is a paint-by-numbers work. The characters, story-lines and politics are a re-hashing of his better efforts. Unfortunate, really. I had high hopes for this book. The setting is certainly novel. Maybe Turledove should focus less on volume and more on quality. However, Into the Darkness is one of his weaker works."
2,interesting but confusing,"with so many characters and countries it is difficult to keep track of what is going on throughout the book. it seems that the story is told by basically going down the list of characters (at the front of the book) in the same order over and over again telling brief portions of events. since there are so many characters.. by the time you get back to see what is going on with one specific person.. you cant remember who they are and what they are doing. other than the confusion, the plot and imaginary world he creates is interesting. i just wish he cut down on number of characters to develope a few allowing you to become interested in them instead of so many that you dont learn or care much about."
2,Much Mangled History,"Is this a fantasy book? I had trouble deciding. It looks suspiciously like Mr Turtledove took a pretty poor WWII history book and simply changed all the names, and then added a bit of repetitive chat between the many minor characters. How many times did I read 'We've beaten them' and then in the next section someone on the other side say 'They've beaten us'? I found myself laughing out loud at some of it, not just at the intentionally funny bits. Epic fantasy? Dont think so. More a rehash of Harry Turtledove's favourite subjects: the various conflicts of the twentieth century. What next, Vietnam with rabbits ala Watership Down? No, forget I mentioned that. Please, Mr Turtledove, you can do much better than this. Your USA/CSA series is intriguing."
2,"Not bad, But Not Up to Turtledove's Standards","I love Harry Turtledove, but this book is proof that his phenomenal productivity is taking its toll. Just compare it to his two other hardcover releases this year (!), ""The Great War: A Walk in Hell"" and ""Colonization: Second Contact"" and it's obvious that this is the runt of the litter. From page to page it's okay, but it's a draft -- there's little plot unity, with lots of battle scenes that don't really advance the story. I had hoped for a lot of clever and creative magic use, as in the ""Toxic Spell Dump"" series, but that never really materializes. The one subplot that revolves around magic is marginal to the story. Note to Turtledove: You have a great talent, so don't waste it on second-tier projects. What, you can't send your kids to college on the royalties from all your *other* books? Note to publishers: Pay Turtledove more money so he can put more time into fewer projects!"
1,Utterly Unreadable,"This was the first and last Turtledove book I ever picked up. I came into it not knowing what to expect, but hoping to discover something new and exciting. I was very dissapointed. I couldn't get past the first 100 pages, and I'm not one to leave books unfinished. I read books for characters, to get into their heads and go through their adventures and their agonies with them, and when I'm 100 pages into a book and still don't know who the main characters are, or even who these people with all these unpronouncable names are, then I just can't take it."
5,The best and most interesting fantisy war book ever!!!!!,"In this book the author brings out the stratigy and charecter development more than the grusome detiales. Another thing I really like is the wide range of carecters, something you don't see in many books. I can't wait until the next book comes out.[This may not be easy for some people to read because I'm not a very good speller]"
2,"A long, tedious slog of a book that gets better as you read","I'm getting a bit sick of the Turtledove formula. Turtledove likes to generate 20 or 30 point of view characters, put them in the same milieu, and recount their struggles for day to day existence. It worked in the first 3 World War books (which is about all that was required to make that series work), but it doesn't work here. I found myself identifying with nobody in this story, and thus forgetting who was supposed to be whom.... not that I cared. After a while, the parrallels to World War 2 start becoming obvious (as mentioned by another reviewer) and then the book becomes slightly interesting. You have to have patience to get there."
2,I can't believe I didn't put it down earlier!,"The only reason I didn't give it one star is it had its moments - not many, but a couple. The characters are spread out too far to keep straight. Obviously from the reviews, this is a story about a world at war and it never ends or seems to have a point... perhaps that is the point. I have a VERY bad taste in my mouth after this book. Beware!"
4,Almost perfect,"The only 'but' is that the last two songs are sung by Buddy's brother. The tribute to Tbone is amazing. If you got the hot licks video, well, here you can hear him playing that on CD. And She suits me to a T is among his greatest recorded performances."
4,brings back childhood memories!,"I was like 8 years old when I first heard of this band from Chile, and my mom bought me the cassette version of this album back in like 1988. I love this album, it's pop-y, catchy and fun to sing along with (that's if you speak spanish). The best thing is that it just brings back my childhood memories!Definitely a cd worth checking out just for the fun of it!"
4,"Very well done, with some bugs to work out still","Like everyone else, I was stunned when I first heard ""The Height of Callousness,"" which is quite the departure from Spineshank's 2-dimensional debut. The production is much cleaner and sleeker and almost has a ""new car feel"" to it. No doubt, Spineshank have grown. The songs on here are extremely catchy, most noticeably ""Asthmatic"" and ""Cyanide 2600"" which are also my favorites. There is no image tied in with this band, which is a good thing. A bunch of normal guys in regular clothing playing good music, as opposed to idiots jumping around in jumpsuits and halloween masks. Of course, this disc does have it draw-backs. Certain songs are too much like each other, and it does get a little redundant at times. But overall I think you will find ""The Height of Callousness"" to be a very satisfying purchase."
5,very intense,"I went through that phase where I really liked Nu-Metal. Of all the Nu-Metal CDs I've listened to, this one really stands out. Unlike most other similar CDs, there is not, I repeat, there is not a single track that tones down a bit; every track is very intense. The guy screams in every track, and when he's not screaming, he uses his scratching singing voice, not melo smooth singing sound. The band also mixes in some electronics in the music. While this band is not as big and probably won't leave as big of a Nu-Metal legacy as like Korn or Disturbed, it is still played in my CD player very often."
3,"good, Stricly Diesel is better","yes, this cd is a good metal cd, bur Stricly Diesel has a lot more aggression and Passion."
2,Shank has proven to be ontop the metal food chain,"let me start off by saying that this album is just great. These fellas really know how to play their instruments unlike the untalented and unoriginal bands like Sodom, Venom, Running Wild, Iced Earth, Malficarum, Ragnarok, edguy, Megadeth, and Los Tigres del Norte. I seriously couldn't stop listening to this album for a while (well not at least until I heard Limp Bizkit's Significant Other and Results May vary, very intricate albums by the way)the guitar solos are amazing and the singer I think tops those sh*tty death metal singers like Chris Barnes, Chuck Schuldiner, and George""corpsegrinder""Fisher their vocals are very audible whereas these guys are very incoherent and brutal to the max I think this album deserves 10 stars but just because the cover looke like poop it gets 2"
2,Static-X is better,"Yes, I AM giving Spineshank two stars because they're too heavy, and yes, I know you're going to call me a poser who likes *N Sync. I'm sure you wouldn't DARE think I listen to bands like Nothingface and Static-X, and like meaningful heavy stuff. However, if you read the fine print in the liner notes, you'll realize that most of the lyrics are written by Tommy Decker, the drummer. This means that John Santos is screaming his head off to lyrics he didn't even write! I don't know about you, but I think that bands sound better if the vocalist wrote the lyrics. If you want proof, listen to Renegades by Rage Against the Machine then Evil Empire by the same band. Notice any difference?Please do real music a favor, and get Wisconson Death Trip by Static-X or Nine Inch Nails' Broken EP instead of this. I promise you, they're a million times better, and have better lyrics, of course!"
1,If i could give it lower i would.,Simple not what I would call up to par. Spineshank is trying for instant stardome and is going about it in the wrong way. Trying to take the current rap-scheme in rock and put yet another dish in front of a already full table is like trying to milk us for our every dollar. These guys have not done anything new and interesting for me to eat up. The CD is short and the songs leave me wanting something more. Save these guys for an opening act to maybe...Cher?
4,Great Album.....strictly is better though,"I like Spineshank, and NO i did not find out about them from their ""synthetic"" video.I was in a Sam Goody back in the beginning of 2000 and saw this. It looked cool so i bought it.Back to Callousness. I bought it because i liked the first album.This album is super-cool. Its a little repetative. Some songs sound a lot alike in some ways. Every song on here is great, standout tracks are probablyAsthmatic, Height of Callousness, Synthetic, New Disease, Play God, Cyanide 2600.All of the songs are good.If you are a fan of Slipknot and Mudvayne, you should definetaly be wanting more from tracks like Asthmatic, and Height of Callousness. I like this a lot, but it is a very short CD, but thats only 11 songs.awesome!"
4,Who are these guys?,"I'm surprised I haven't heard of Spineshank before. The first time I heard the song Synthetic was on a radio station new music compilation, not to mention MTV's Return of Rock v.2. That song rocks, and if it gets any radio time, you're definately going to be hearing a lot about these guys. This is one of the hardest CDs I own (and I own a lot of hard s***), and there's some good stuff on here. Synthetic's awesome, and there's also a few good ones, like Malnutrition and Play God, but the song Cyanide 2600 is one you'll want to play while getting an exorcism performed. There's enough screaming and shouting with heavy guitars to make bands like Papa Roach blush (in that one song alone), and the lyrics are just as hate-filled. If you're expecting the rest of the CD to sound like Synthetic, you'll be in for a surprise. But if you like angry bands, by all means, pick this one up!"
5,this is some bada$$ stuff,"I hadn't really heard much spineshank before, but a friend of mine had me listen to new disease and i thought it was pretty good. A while later i was browsing cd's and saw this one. It was cheapish (cheaper than on the website, that's for sure) and i bought it. This album blew me away, it's heavy, but doesn't sound repetitive, the vocals are harsh but make good use of melody. The guitar bass and drums are all constant refreshing assaults on your senses. Buy this album, i gauarantee you won't regret it."
5,This cd rocks,"I liked Spineshank from the beginning, when I first heard their debut cd Strictly Diesel. Obviously Roadrunner knows how to sign a lot of good bands to their label, and they hit paydirt again with the group Spineshank. While Strictly Diesel was awesome, it is not half as good as this cd. I was rocking out the entire time I was listening to it, it is one heavy cd through and through. Not only that but how Spineshank focuses on their music lyric-wise. Although I like Static X too, their lyrics are way to simple, not the case with Spineshank though. I didn't like how amazon reviewed this cd, it doesn't even begin to describe how good this cd is. I suggest you fully ignore the [Amazon.com review]and go out and buy this cd, you can thank me later."
5,THIS IS WAY TOO INTENSE!!!,"Wow, that is all I had to say when I heard this album. It is the most intense albums I've ever heard. Way harder than slipknot, these guys have raised the bar for heavy sound. This sound is hard to describe, its mostly electronicle,and some synthisized. I call it robot rock, because it truly is the sound of the future.To me, there are no favorite tracks because I like them all. This cd is definetly an improvement from thier last. It is going to be hard to sound heavier than this without sounding crazy."
3,Hard Techno Rock,"I've never been much of a fan of music that people scream in rather than sing. But Spineshank doesn't ALWAYS scream, which makes it better than some. Not bad. If you like SLipknot or Hed(pe) you're in for a treat."
4,Bash your head through the walls excitment!!!!,While they definalty sound like a few other bands out there (static-x comes to mind) they still managed to make a prtty awsome album here. Great for relieving some anger. And if any evanscence fans happen to read this (which i doubt it) THIS IS WHAT HARDCORE MUSIC IS!!YEAHHHHH!
4,Great Book,I am very happy with the book. It is a quality book with a nice hard cover. The type size is easy to read. I purchased three editions of the Book of Enoch and this is far and away the best of the three. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a copy of the Book of Enoch. I am glad I bought this book.
5,reveals a lot,great book. read with an open mind before judging. there are things in this book that can't possibly be made up
3,The Book of Enoch..,It's not really fair for me to rate this book..I bought it for a friend..I bought the Book of Jasher also and he is into that one..I bought this one because after watching a video..I found that both are referred to by the Bible..I plan to order both for myself..I think I will find it fascinating..
3,Omitted from the Bible,"I now understand why The Book of Enoch was omitted from the Bible. It's some what repetitive. However, to each it's own, my curiosity has now been satisfied. I would not recommend as a Bible study tool."
1,The Books of Enoch are Great but not this translation,"The great thing about this book its his numerous references to the Protestant Bible. It would be great if there were some on the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical works but its enought for a Baptiste to juste mentionne the name of Enoch. Indeed, even the translation is an old one of Charles who try to cut the fact that Enoch is the Son of Man. Every scholars admit it know (because they dont have the choice!). Dont buy it if you want a good translation, but if you want good quotation buy it, but you will notice that the author have wrongs presuppositions!"
5,Enoch,The best copy of the book of Enoch by-far. You will not be disappointed. This book has the bible scriptures at the bottom of the book that line-up with the writings of Enoch. This gives the book of Enoch credibility in a biblical way. Also the chapters and the placement of the verses are placed very neatly for good quick reading.
3,like a sandwhich without the meat...,"First of all ive read online the book of enoch, I wanted to have hard copy, this is not the full book , it is taken just on the parts that coincide with scripture...I was a little dissapointed... good to see the truth,, but when taken out of context , there might be a small paragragh or couple sentences, that describe a larger part actually written,, def not worth the money , nice cover...Im going to print the online version in completeness...."
3,Still a Goldwater Fan,"Dispite my mild dissappointment with the author, I enjoyed gaining greater insight into my political hero. While I do not consider myself qualified to critique anyone's writing ability, the author too frequently repeats certain otherwise interesting Goldwater quotes. Unfortunately, this impression will compete with my overall favorable feeling."
4,"Solid collection of early ""Dragnet""","This is a good collection of early ""Dragnet"" episodes. The ones on tape one (""The Big 17"" and ""The Big Producer"") contain original cigarette commercials. The other four episodes are ""The Big Counterfeit,"" ""The Big Deal,"" ""The Big Rod"" and ""The Big Crime."" The last one is especially dark: two little girls are kidnapped, molested and released, and there's some unexpected violence when Joe and Frank collar the ""perp."" I had no problems with the tapes, and it was a very pleasant surprise to find they were all at SP, instead of the usual EP speed for budget tapes. Only complaints: the misleading packaging which shows Bill Gannon (sorry, he's not here) and claims the shows are in color. It's 50's B&W all the way, but that's not a bad thing. Picture and sound quality are fine."
4,like butter,"This blade works well on my 12"" dewalt.It cut cherry with zero effort and did not burn at all.I should have bought 2 for the price, but I don't think I will ever need another one unless I do something stupid and break some teeth.The only thing I am not sure about is that it doesn't have a non-stick coating on it like other blades. But it it's not like I will be cooking eggs on it.I would recommend this to a friend if they could get it for under $30 like I did."
1,O Miners,"Never received. Incorrect item shipped initially, and later was told it was out of stock. Refund was eventually given."
3,a very good emotional movie,"this movie was very emotional, Billy Christal was ok as a greedy producer. But the giant played by the Hungarian guy with the difficult name was abolutely wonderful. Three stars for him (don't mind steven seagal)"
1,Very Disappointed,I could hardly believe the language used in this movie. We wanted to view this movie and seeing it was rated PG I had no trouble with the kids being there but with the language content this should have been PG13. The language turned me off to the whole movie.
1,My Giant is more like a kids movie,I thought this movie sucked. Billy Crystal wasn't even funny. He tries to be funny in some scenes but the whole movie is just plain dumb. The only thing that I got excited about this movie was that tall guy. I heard he's 7'7 in real life.
1,Billy Crystal at his worst!,I love Billy Crystal! But I hated this movie! I will always hate it! How does a man so talented as a comedian go do a drama and expect to excell? It was a poor attempt at a movie!
3,BIG STAR ON THE HORIZON,"The relationship between self-centered agent Billy Crystal and real-life NBA star Gheorghe Muresan is the main reason to watch this otherwise sentimental, few laughs comedy. Crystal is his usual competent self in a role obviously written with him in mind. In his film debut, Muresan brings an affable presence in his role as a 7 1/2 ft. giant Crystal stumbles on while visiting his current client in Romania. The young actor (Rider Strong) fires Crystal and Crystal decides to put the rather naive giant into the same movie. Muresan agrees only to find the love his youth who now lives in Galloop, USA. (Gallup, New Mexico). A subplot involves Crystal's failed marriage with Kathleen Quinlan (who doesn't get to do a whole lot, but is always watchable). Martial arts star Steven Segal plays himself, and Joanna Pacula appears as the rather disappointing love of Muresan's life. Hokey and often trite, MY GIANT is fun to watch because of its two stars."
4,these kicks are great,"these shoes are great!! so comfortable,cushioning is awesome!looks cool too. just one bad thing is that it is cut low for a mid shoes. great shoes for casual wear and bball!!"
3,Not quite right,"I purchased this kit along with the A990 kit. In point of fact, both are A990 engines. The color of both is incorrect. The race Hemis were Race Hemi orange, not the Street Hemi orange on these models. Race Hemi orange is more yellow.The rocker covers are black wrinkle in this kit. All of the original race Hemis had chrome rocker covers. I have personal knowledge of this, as I was around when these motors were introduced in 1964 and I crewed one of the 50 factory super stock 65 Dodges. The black wrinkle finish rockers appeared on the street Hemi.The die cast reference is misleading. The engine block is three pieces held together with self tapping screws. This is the only die cast part of the kit. The rest of the pieces are all plastic.The fit of the kit is marginal. I had expected a 1/4 scale kit to have better fit and finish due to the large size.I'd have given a lower rating if the price hadn't been so good. Once assembled and in a display case it looks ok."
3,Die cast weak,Die cast block was broke while still in the box...Block is a weak point!!!...Other than that it wuz very good.
1,Caution! Abusive Therapy Promoted Here,"Shame on everyone here who gave this book a favorable review. The book promotes a highly abusive practice based on coercive restraint and screaming/yelling/humiliating/threatening a child *as therapy* which lasts for hours and hours, until the child is a whimpering little puddle, as one observer noted.Several decades ago, Foster Cline popularized this practice as ""Rage Reduction"" therapy; it is now known more commonly as Attachment Therapy. It is condemned as abusive by all national mental health professional organization.Cline invents the ""needs cycle,"" uses an unrecognized diagnosis called ""attachment disorder,"" and has a very poor grasp on child development overall."
1,"The International Party Guide for ""Innocents Abroad""","This book did not live up to my expectations based on the write-up and reviews. If you are an ""Innocent Abroad"" and have done very little international traveling, buy it. However, if you've been ""around the block"" a few times, you may find it useless information. I bought this book in advance of a trip to Bangkok and Koh Samui and was really surprised at the lack of and incorrect information. There are much better books on the market including ""The Rough Guide"" series. If you're going to Amsterdam, I would recommend ""Get Lost! The Cool Guide to Amsterdam"". It's more informative, funkier, funnier and cheaper! Fortunately, I have been to Bangkok and Koh Samui is pretty easy to figure out quickly. Just wish I had saved the money that I spent on this future paperweight. Could have bought a lot of beer with the money!"
4,Have had it for over 2 years now.,Use the Winix every day and night . I live in dusty invironment and this filter picks up A LOT of debris from the air.I am going to purchase a second unit for another room. Removes cat box odor from air quickly .The sensors are very accurate.Filters are pricey but I vacuum mine every two weeks to extend their life.An added bonus: I have severe to moderate tinnitus (ringing in the ears.) Very loud at night. The air rushing from the air cleaner actually cancels out the the ear ringing where I don't even notice it.Definately recommend this product.
4,nice product,"The description says good for most propane and battery lanterns but gives no size. It is about 12 inches tall. It is a soft case so not as tough as the hard plastic cases but provides good cushioning for my smaller lantern. Seems to be well made with a very sturdy bottom. The zipper closure goes up one side, around the top and bach down a few inches farther around. I would like to see one made about 15 inches tall for my bigger lantern.."
3,"so, so i guess",This book is a little intimidating at first. The author used a lot of medical terms and references the average person wouldn't understand. I enjoy the book though. It is good for highlighting as reference points.
3,Great performance; 1st copy was flawed,"The performance is a good one - dynamic, well engineered in that it is balanced between the quiet and fortissimo sections. The first jewel case arrived with the same music on each CD! Labelled as though the proper music was on the 2d CD, just wrong. Amazon traded it out seamlessly."
4,ADD or DDD?,"Amazon does not indicate a SPARS code for this set; the liner notes say DDD, but ADD is printed on each disc. It sounds more like ADD to me, but I can't be sure. At any rate, I find all the performances and sound quality to be excellent. It's a very fulfilling rendition of a nice selection of Respighi's work. I am no aficionado of this composer, but I very much enjoy listening to this set."
4,A Lot on 2 CDs,"Belfagor is interesting for its rarity. Rousing overture. Pines and Fountains acceptable. Acceptable is OK for Fountains, but Pines call out for outstanding Triptych and Ancient Airs and Dances are excellent. Considering the bargain price, this 2-fer is a winner."
5,Tilting windmills,"I was looking for something new to put on my walls. I was browsing and came upon Don Quixote.I kept going back to it and finally chose it, I was surprised to see that the creator was Picasso. Normally, I am not drawn to his work. When it came it was more impressive than I expected. It is now on a wall in my house and I smile every time I look at it."
5,The best thing since moist leaves!,"These wipes aren't just for kids. They're great for anyone who wants that extra clean feeling. If you're tired of dry, flimsy, annoying toilet paper, then you HAVE to try Tidy Tykes. Plus, they come with Sesame Street stickers!!!!"
1,Metra kit did not work on Scion xB 2008,"I tried using this kit to install a non-factory radio into my 2008 Scion xB. The legs labeled xB appeared to match up with the screw holes at first glance; however, once I placed the mount inside the dash (without the radio) the legs did not quite fit. It looked as though they could be slightly bend and still work. With the radio secured to the mount it was impossible to mount the kit within the dash. I ended up having to remove the legs labeled xB(now it had no legs at all), screw holes in the side, and mount the original metal brackets from the factory radio to the last of the dash kit. I do not recommend this kit for anyone with a 2008 Scion xB."
5,Fantastic kit for aftermarket radios,"I got this kit for my 2004 scion xA to install a pioneer 4400HD head unit. Just broke off the tabs that weren't labeled xA and installed with no problem, definitely recommend this kit."
4,Pretty good for the price,"Easy kit to use... I think the instructions could be a bit more clear, but they definitely aren't so vague that you can't understand them. Just go slow and take your time, don't break off the wrong tabs. Take a second to.familiarize yourself with the mounting points in your car before you start snapping them off the kit."
2,This kit had TWO right brackets,I was unable to install this dash kit because they put two right side brackets instead of one for each side.
2,Informative yet highly biased,"It's undeniable that this book offers an interesting and informative perspective, but that's just what it is: a perspective. I was looking for an unbiased book to inform me of both sides of the conflict, and what I found was a book bordering on yellow journalism that uses a combination of careful exemption of key information and tone words to slight the Israelis. It's easy to take it as unbiased on the surface, but anyone who does research into the entire conflict and its history can see that the author leaves out many of the Palestinian horrors that contribute to it. I recommend the book for anyone that is searching for information regarding international law and Israel's offenses of such laws, but beyond that, I caution anyone looking for an unbiased perspective. If you do read the book, please keep an open mind and be aware of its bias, and always research into every claim to find a genuinely inclusive set of facts."
1,One side only,"If you are only aware of the Pro-Israel side of this story or if you just want to read more Pro-Palestinian views, this is an interesting read. It is not, however, an objective ""primer""."
1,A reputation to protect,"As it happens, the ""Primer"" is anything but, unless one loves terrorists and hates Israelis - which is the case with the author of this rather insignificant book. The 'badly invented people', a.k.a. ""palestinians"", will never make peace with the Israelis because of the humiliating experience of having to wake up every morning and look at their fabulously successful neighbors who don't really give a damn about them or their brethren. Trying to ""prove"" that this is not the case seems to be the agenda of the author. But he fails miserably in this endeavor, as one can expect from a history twister like Phillis Bennis. Sorry but there are hundreds of other books that paint a true and reliable picture of the never-ending conflict between Arabs and Israelis."
1,Worth one star,"I read this book. It is a source of misinformation that is worth at most one star. If you would like to know more about it, please feel free to e-mail me."
4,A vital perspective,"Ok, this book may not be the most ""neutral"" source of information regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it is nonetheless a source of vital information that is far too often neglected by Americans. Most voices in the U.S. are either unmercifully pro-Israel, or muddled in a weak sense of neutrality that is afraid of making any strong statements.I found the format of this book extremely helpful. It's very easy to navigate, and its language is clear and simple."
4,A good overview.,"SAS shows training for every Special Forces troops in a fairly comprehensive overview. It is not easy to be in this elite group, and men must be commited to get there. Since 9-11 there is a new awareness of the dangers SF face to protect freedom, and a new appreciation.If you want to know the path some of the men and women take, read this book."
4,GREAT!,"This book is really great. It's interesting, and you learn tons from it. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes martial arts."
1,A cheesy capitalization on the Jaws/Shark fad of the time,"First of all, this movie came out less than a year after Jaws, (a superior classic), which was released in 1975. Poor Burt reynolds should stick to his hilarious Smokey & Cannonball & Longest Yard movies. This was the stankest movie I ever ever saw, next to The Creeping Terror. Damn, I even paid to see it at the theater. The picture is grainy, the plot has no plot and the shark scenes are obviously poor archive shots and extremely hard to see as well as almost non-existent throughout the movie.If you are drunk & bored, then watch this movie, with a little warning - You will probably laugh throughout the first half, (all of 40 minutes), then pass out thinking you had a very bad dream. Save your money unless you really have money to blow. Heh heh! -Dale"
3,Blue's Masters Harmonica Classics,"I already had two other CD's in this collection which are also harmonicablues. This was good, but sounded too much like the others. I also purchased the Blue's Master's slide guitar classics which is great."
3,True meaning of Christmas,"It's Christmastime, and all Dylan Taylor wants is an XR-7 limited edition speedster.However, his hopes are zapped when he discovers it's extravagant price tag would overload the family budget.That is until he hears that the two-wheeled titanium turbo bike is the grand prize of Odyssey's yard decorating contest.But Dylan's scheming neighbor, Doug, has other plans.And when he gets a glimpse of Doug's snow-sculpted, ten-foot tall twin T-Rexes towing a skiing Elvis amid a cluster of cut-down palm trees, Dylan switches his design from a humble manger scene to a super-charged, mega-watt wonderland.What follows is a powerful reminder that grounds them all in the true meaning of Christmas."
2,Love the soap but overpriced and undersized,I love this soap and was disappointed when I couldn't find it in the store anymore. I was happy to find it here but found the price high and the size of the bars small.
1,should have read reviews,The picture makes it look like its actually 9 bars but its only 3. This makes the product not even close to being competitively priced.
4,If Santana Were a Jam Band...,"I bought this CD at the Nice (pronounced Neece) Jazz Fesitval in Nice, France. It cost me about two bucks and it was by Santana so I thought it would be worth it, and it definately was. While there is no singing on the album, the songs are amazing because Carlos Santana just lets loose and plays (roughly) 10 minutes songs that beautifully demonstrate his (godly) guitar skill. I am not a fan of jam bands like Dave Matthews and Phish, but this album is just so chill that I can't get enough of it; not to mention that it is nearly impossible to get in the US. If you ever have a chance to buy this album, you should, because you won't be disappointed."
5,"so simple, yet so brilliant","I'm sort of a new lover of Harold Budd. I've only known or heard of this great composer for about 8 months now, but I've spent this time tranfixed on the style and mood of Harold Budd. I can not say I have all the fancy words or expressions of some of the other reviews on here of his CD's, but the music trancends time and space, and takes you to far off places. Luxa is one of the finest CD's in my Budd collection now. Even though I paid a heavty price for it, and was a bit reluctant, it was very much worth the money. Much in the same feel as ""The White Arcade"" and ""The Room"", but the sound quality and depth of sound is remarkable. I highly recommend this CD. If your just starting out your Budd collection like me, begin with the more obvious titles, but work your way to Luxa, you won't be disappointed."
2,Buyer beware,"I'm sure this is a good recording--if you really want the German dialogue interrupting the music. I love some of the music (from selections discs) from the Merry Widow and wanted to hear all of it. Unfortunately, some or all of the German dialogue sits between the songs. When I buy Oklahoma or My Fair Lady, I don't want to hear the actors speaking in between songs, and I don't want to hear spoken dialogue in German either. It's very annoying, to me anyway. Additionally, I thought some of the singing was much more mannered in this production than other versions I prefer."
3,flash gordon vhs 3-pack video,"three cassettes,three volumes, two episodes per volume. 1.""deadline at noon"": a decent copy with very little footage missing. 2.""the subworld revenge"":a decent copy w/ no problems. 3.""the waterworld menace"":a nice copy. 4.""the brain machine"":a real bad copy. alot of drop out of images. 5.""the planet of death"":a nice copy. 6.""the forbidden experiment"":a nice copy."
5,Best book about OCD I have read,"This book really saved my career.I found all the explanations I needed, and most importantly - how to change you behavior.The techniques were easy to follow (of course, a total committment is necessary)"
3,Out of Date,"I felt the book was a bit out of date, and as a result at least half of the book could be edited out. There is valuable information in the book, but there is a lot of material to sift through to find it."
3,Its a reference book,"A bulky reference book. Its useful if you want to refer something - but definitely not a cover-to-cover read as I thot it would be. To be fair, it has detailed info about all artists' materials, hardware etc - but just didn't suit my needs."
2,To cover a visual art form without photos is dumb.,"A publisher's dream...lotsa paper and words and text. But very short on clear, concise instructions on how to do the things this book describes...NO graphics to demonstrate the content"
5,The Artist's Bible,"This is the Artist's classic, and the Artist's Bible of not only what materials are but when they came into use, how they are formulated and why. Want to learn how to make your own gesso for silverpoint? Want to cut a quill pen? Want to make your own pastels? Can't remember how to make your own sizing or gesso? Want to try your hand at encaustic or egg tempera painting? Want to know which colors in the spectrum are likely to fade (are fugitive colors) in watercolor and which are not? It's here."
5,Essential Information.,"If this text were to reside in EVERY artist studio, and was referred to often, the world would be a better place. This book has been a standard reference, and in many instances a required text, for ages and for good reason. Get the revised 5th ed. but when you see earlier editions cheap, snatch them up as well. Information on things like older pigments has in some cases been dropped to make way for later additions; the handy oil index chart disappeared from the 3rd edition, that info is now included in the pigment descriptions and not near as handy; you get the idea. All this is understandable from an editor's pov but a loss non-the-less. Get the newest edition and refer to it often but don't neglect the older editions. Just because some info has been dropped doesn't necessarily mean it's obsolete or no longer relevant."
1,Fact or Fiction,I may have missed something but is this book fact or fiction? Are Caroline and Susan real people? The descriptive prose and dialog sound more like a novel than the retelling of actual events. It sounded very contrived.
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews. I really wanted to expand my vegetable cooking repertoire. I tried several of the recipes in the cookbook, and haven't been really happy with any. (For example, the Sauteed Beets with Butter and Orange Juice were the best beets I've had, but they are still beets.) The book is very informative about the vegetables themselves and only lacks nutritional information, which I think would have been an asset to the book."
1,Save Your Money,"I had to give it one but it doesn't deserve it. This book is even worse than his other book. There is not a single usable recipe in this book. A typical recipe: take a vegetable put some olive oil in a pan and cook it. He's got to be kidding!! Sometimes he really goes wild and adds some herbs or cheese. This book is not worth the money. You don't need a cookbook cook vegetables in a pan with some oil!!! This is guy who is exploiting his fame from Cooks Illustrated to sell really, really bad cookbooks. There are no pictures because, well.. there are no dishes to take pictures of!!"
4,"Good Info, Unexciting Recipes","I use this book almost every week, to check how to buy, store, or prepare particular vegetables, especially those that are so seasonal that I don't cook them that often: okra, for example. I like this book a lot for the advice it gives on Availability, Selection, Storage, Basic Preparation, and Best Cooking Methods for each vegetable. That section, at the beginning of each vegetable (the veggies are in alphabetical order, starting with Artichoke, ending with Zucchini), is two pages long. Following this basic information are 4-6 pages of recipes for that vegetable. These recipes are almost always, as another reviewer pointed out, for veggies as side dishes, not entrees. These recipes are okay, but not that exciting. Still, I do recommend this book."
5,Happy New Year 2010,"We have owned this cookbook for a few years. It is one of the most-used cookbook in the house. I felt moved today to review it because we had the Braised Collards with Tomatoes and Peanuts on page 113, along with made-from-scratch cornbread and Old Glory black-eyed peas for dinner today for New Years Day. It was wonderful. None of the recipes are froo-froo - just plain good and easy. Happy New Year 2010 and eat your vegatables!"
4,Great information,"The book is not just a simple compilation of recipes, but also includes information on how to buy and store each vegetable. The book also discusses the various cooking methods (poaching, steaming, braising, grilling, broiling, etc.) and how they affect the flavor.Even if you don't use a single recipe in this book, you will still benefit from the basic preparation instructions given for each vegetable.This book will also give you the information you need to try out the produce that you've previously bypassed in the store because you had no idea how to pick it out or prepare it."
4,Vegetables every day - great cook book,"This author was interviewed on National Public Radio awhile back, which motivated me to buy it. We eat a lot of veggies in our home, so I was very interested. Although many of the recipes are very basic, and I have better recipes myself, the background info he gives is invaluable! He tells you when the item is in season, where to find it, how it should look when you buy it, etc. He also discusses veggies that I would never have thought to look for, so he does a good job of expanding your horizons. A great cook book!"
3,Vegetables on the side,"I ordered this book because I want to make vegetables a central part of my meals. However, almost all of the recipes in this book are for vegetables as a side dish.If you want an ""encyclopedia"" of vegetables, with information on how to choose them, basic preparation and cooking, and which spices/herbs go best, then Vegetables Every Day is an excellent choice. But if you want a book full of recipes with vegetables as a main dish, then look elsewhere."
5,every kitchen should have one...,"This is my ""go to"" book when ever I have a vegatable I'm not sure how to prepare. The recipies are straightforward and tasty, and the discussion of each vegetable before the recipies helps me understand how to choose the freshest produce and/or how to recognize fresh produce when it's offered."
2,hum drum recipes,"I have found this book to have very simple, but very unoriginal recipes. I didn't buy it to find out that sauteing vegetables is one way to eat them. I guess if you've never cooked much, or if you've never eaten many vegetables, it would be good, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Important reading,"The '80s is decidedly an important decade in twentieth-century America, colored by significant events and social changes, perhaps eclipsed only by the more radical era that preceded it by some twenty years. These collections of essays present a multitude of thoughts, both about and of the '80s, thoughts that both analyzed and constituted the zeitgeist of the decade. From Kristol's serious manifesto of neoconservatism to Wolfe's hilarious ridicule of pretentious public art, The Eighties: A Reader remains an indispensable portrait of a tumultuous time."
5,One Awesome Vacuum,"This vacuum is everything I was looking for in a vacuum for my apartment. It has enough power for what I need and everything is designed very well, from the attachment holders to the control panel.Also as mentioned by other reviews, this thing is very light and easy to move around. I also like the option of either using the reusable cloth dust bag or the disposable paper bag."
4,Vacuum Cleaner/Nice,"This item was bought for a gift. The person loves how easy it is to push. Also, it is very lightweight for them to carry. She also thinks that for its small size it has good suction."
4,"Gentle cleansing, Great scent; but drips are annoying","Liquid hand soap is about three things: 1) cleaning hands gently, 2) smelling great, 3) no-fuss product delivery (and decent looking bottle). #1 and #2 are great; #3 not so much because the product is so sticky it tends to leave sticky drips unless you wipe/scrape the excess after every hand pump. The bottle isn't particularly handsome either (compared to the Method bottles)."
4,Achingly beautiful; really grabs you!,"This is why I like the Smashing Pumpkins! The title track of course is the savage ""Ava Adore"", but the real reason, as all the reviews below say, to buy this CD is the 2 bonus tracks. ""Czarina"" and ""Once In A While"" are absolutely amazing love songs which, were it not for Billy's nasal voice, would not sound one bit like Pumpkins' songs! It's that ability to morph into new forms which makes them, in my opinion, THE best rock band of the 1990's. Grab this CD while you can!"
2,"Ava Adore is good, but the 2 other songs aren't that good.","Ava Adore is a really good song. Great rhythm and lyrics. However, the 2 other songs are very slow. I was expecting the B-sides to Ava Adore a little similar to it. If you like the song Ava Adore, I suggest you buy the album ""Adore"" because it has a lot of good tracks. It's worth the $$$."
4,It is good,"It is good, because the cd creates a mood and you can listen to the cd when you are in that mood.This one is the first smashing cd I bought after this one I went and bought the other ones.It is good."
4,Nice looking,"Originally wanted dark brown, but settled for plain brown as dark was not available in my size.Have been complimented several times on the good looks of this shoe. However, they are not quite as light as I thought from the description in the product name. I need these shoes for standing work (retail), and they barely do after inserting cushioned in-soles. However, even softer shoes probably would be too casual for my work."
1,For police or corrections officers,"I am not a police or corrections officer, but if I were, I would be more satisfied with this book. The majority of the ""set-ups"" in the book assume that an officer is encountering fairly passive (and unarmed) resistance, and basically already has the upper hand. For example, how to use the kubotan to enforce compliance in a detainee being taken to court.On the other hand, I'm a civilian, interested in non-lethal self defense. The book didn't offer nearly as much for my use. Besides that, the first 20 pages or so are advertising for the authors' kubotan training programs, directed to police or corrections officers. It's not what I was looking for."
1,Piece of Garbage,"I bought this product from Microcenter. It cost 35 bucks.It disconnects every 2 minutes (no, literally). And the highest speed i got it to run at was 2 mbps.The worst thing is, it overheats very very fast (5 minutes) and just turns off.Its a rip off, i am gonna go and return it tomorrow."
4,Class of '86 dream,"This CD is everything that will remind you of the good old days. Although, Danzig, Biafra and Siouxie Sioux would puke if they new about the new wave title! Buy it anyway, It's worth it"
1,Lame,Vapid and not worth the plastic it's printed on. All unsold copies should be recalled and turned into guitar picks.
5,The game is evolving... So is the soundtrack.,"Jesper Kyd is famous for his awesome video games' scores. I first listened to him while playing Freedom Fighters and I found it amazing.The Hitman series are games with great stories, unfortunately the first three of them were not very carefully made, but the forth installment - Blood Money - is something memorable and the soundtrack does not fall behind.I would recommend any Hitman soundtrack, but this one is rock solid."
3,"Descent Soundtrack, Great Game","As far as video game OSTs go, this one is pretty good. But the soundtrack is a bit too electronic and that doesn't really fit with the noir mood of the hitman series. I'm a big fan of Franz Shubert's 'Ave Maria' and was pleasantly suprised to find it in the opening sequence. There should be more of this kind of music on the CD."
5,Caballe at her best,"Granted, she may not have the dramatic fire and insight of Maria Callas, but she does possess what may arguably be the most beautiful soprano voice of the past 50 years. These recordings represent Caballe at her peak -- early 1970's -- and proves that her technical control was indeed a thing of wonder. Listen to Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene; this could very well be the best-sung version on record. Not to mention the gorgeous pianissimo high C at the end of ""O Patria Mia."" A valuable recording for fans of Caballe and of fine singing."
4,Jerks Works,"Chris Lindsay's Let me Tell You About Jerks takes me back to my college days, where I took a philosophy class and was required to read Aristotle. When Aristotle was convinced of something, he would go on and on and on until, finally, the audience was left speechless and convinced he was right. Chris Lindsay convinces us that Jerks do exist and lays out the fool-proof arguments. It's funny and true (unless you're a jerk)."
4,The dead are still with us,"This movie is entertaining, fight scenes, gory dead, grusome dogs (yes ewww) and some revelations you will need for the next movie. Even though I did not give the first movie a good review, these are at least entertaining."
2,"Good action, but they tried to do too much","This movie would have been better if they had developed the characters more and stopped trying to cram so much into a relatively short movie.I do not play the Resident Evil game, but I like movies based on games. It feels like this movie was created by a committee of game players with ADD.Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hot. The costumes, weapons, action sequences, etc...are very well done. Overall, it's a good movie that could have been so much better."
3,Good movie but could have been better,I'm a die hard RE fan. So I'm use to the games more. This movie was good. Lots of action which is nice. But it wasn't all that scary like the first one. Playing RE: 3 last espace is so scary and I felt the film was lacking that. Plus they hardly showed Nemesis.
3,This is Resident Evil?,"Well... There is not much one can say about the differences between the first and the second movie. The budget was increased which made for a little more fun when it came to addressing the lack of actor talent, but the story line overshot the possibilities this movie presented. I have played every Resident Evil game, read every book (soon including the newest one), and I put faith that the second movie was to be outstanding when the first one really wasn't bad. Overall, I give this flick three stars and pray that the third, if there is one, is much better off. Oh, nary I forget, if you are going to use actual character names, how about you get the personalities right. Nicholai does not help out kiddies."
4,way better than the first one,"I didn't care for the first one. I thought it was too slow. This one however revived the series. As the rating board says on the movie, in fine print under the R rating ""Non stop violence and gore"" need I say more?It was a very good movie. My only problem is I hate matrix type movies and James bond type of movies, meaning: Impossible feats that not only leave you saying ""yea right"" but also are so outrageous they are laughable at best. Ex: she runs down a building on a rope. I thought that was not only impossible, but way cheesy. Movies need to stay away from the Charlie's angels mentality! You begin to stop taking it seriously when you see too much of this. Another nit-pick I have is the fast camera battle sequences. ITS ANNOYING! we all know the scenes. Where the camera moves so fast all you here is grunts from the battle, and a snippet of gore. Hold the camera still you moron!Anyway, awesome movie."
4,UMD PSP RE Apocalypse movie,"I received the UMD movie with a cracked case, whether it was damaged in shipping or the seller did not describe that before selling it. I reccomend not purchasing UMD's for the PSP unless it has the original box case cover for it. The movie still plays even so."
1,DVD does not work in some players,"I bought this DVD at Best Buy thinking it was a pretty good deal to have both the first and second movie on one disc. I didn't watch it immediately and I've since lost the reciept which is bad for me because when I finally did go to play it, the disc doesn't work. It doesn't start, it just freezes the DVD. A friend of mine said he had the same trouble with the same DVD on his player -- which is a Sony. I have a Panasonic home theatre 5 disc changer. So its not just one dvd player that this version does not work on, but several. I'm guessing it is a flaw in the production.While the movies are fantastic horror flicks, the DVD it comes on in this case isn't worth the money you supposedly save buying a compilation."
1,Another bad zombie movie.,"It's another bad zombie movie. Compared to the majority of thhe others, the only difference here is the main character is a female. The plot is the same. The action scenes are not engaging. Special effects are so so."
3,Looks better than the first one.,"Hopefully this one will be better. Jill will be in it...to be honest i don't like the actress that will play Jill. Jill is one great beautiful character, they should have picked someone else. When we heard that Milla would be the star of Resident Evil we thought she`d be Jill. OK...but Nemesis will be in it and that makes up for anything that went wrong in the first one. I hope the soundtrack to be AWESOME!!!. The zombies were not convincing in the first one, they have to look scarier this time"
1,Not as good as the first one,"When I saw ""Resident Evil"" I like it, although it was a free version of the game, of the story. But ""Resident Evil - Apocalypse"", it's disastrous. With a useless explanation by Alice of what happened in the first film and flashbacks. I think they made some kind of mistake when editing the film because the story can be confusing. The dialogues are bad and the performance terrible; why make Alice look tough in the film? And the zombies almost doesn't appear. The special effects are bad and Nemesis is just a mass of makeup, not to mention the music. The only good thing in the movie is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory, which perfomance as a sexy policewoman reults unbelieveable."
3,"OK, of its kind","The kind is a zombie movie, with an extra monster thrown in for fun. That about sums it up.Our Heroines are on the run from the evil flesh-eaters, going through ammunition at a good clip (pun intended). There is the standard cute little girl in need of saving - but this girl turns out to have an odd secret. There is the standard ineffectual babe, though with Jovovich and Guillory around, that's certainly not the only woman's role in this movie. There is the evil alliance of corporation and government in an evil plot and cover-up. You know, the usual.This is just mindless entertainment - not that that's always a bad thing. It's a fair way to kill an evening, if you have one that needs killing.//wiredweird"
2,closer to 3 stars,"i didnt have high expectations to be crushed simply because this isnt that kind of franchise.this isnt like the disaster AvsP is.nothing is.but this is a typical big budget action/horror movie.i dont beleive in leaving my brain,the most important part of most movie goers,at the door,but i didnt have to.i kinda got the gist from part one and this continues from that well.if i were a rabid R/E fan then maybe i would be more thrilled with this.video games turned into movies doesnt really get my undying attention.something about it seems for lack of a better word,''fake''.i liked it enough where as i wasnt bored.i took whatever i saw for granted,i didnt get a headache if everything didnt make sense.so on those terms,its not a bad movie,coming from a person not a R/E fan to begin with."
2,Mind blowing,"That's not really true. I didn't find this movie all that mind blowing.Realistically, noone expects this movie to win any oscars. However, it is a little bit funner than most of Paul W.S. Anderson's other masterpieces. The thing is, you will be laughing at the action rather than be exhilarated by it. My favorite part in the movie is when they take a shortcut through a cemetary. It's priceless.The only bad part about the movie, besides the script, acting, and plot, is the fact that our heroine is now super-human like. She just seems impossible to defeat as she can kill a million zombies with her kung fu abilities."
5,"Pretty good, but not as good as the first.","I am an enormous Milla fan and I thought Resident Evil 2 was good. Although I do prefer the first film. The whole thing about accuracy compared to the actual video game is of little or no importance to me. I am more interested in the quality of the film judged on its own merit. If you like the game, action filled zombie movies or the divine Milla Jovovich, you should check out this DVD. But also take a look at part one, if you haven't already."
1,I've always wondered,How do so many people rate a movie that has not yet been released theatrically? C'mon inquiring minds want to know.
2,Lame...like it was written by a 13 year old.,"This was the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time. The acting was lame, the plot was prepubescent, and the cinematography was less than TV quality. This was the worst of the Resident Evil movies by far."
1,Only the discs were new? WTF!,"I ordered a new one for a reason , and got sent new discs in some crap case and crap cover with some crap stickers all over, trying to pawn it off like new."
2,A poor excuse for violence.,"Alice wakes up to a plague in Raccoon City. Trapped with a small group of survivors, she is forced into finding the daughter of one of the scientists on the t-virus project, in exchange for passage out of the cordoned-off city. But now there's a new threat--along with the zombies and killer hounds, there is Nemesis, a post-human armored mutant. Lucky for Alice she's been given new abilities while she was sleeping. A great excuse for a lot of violence, with very little plot. The makers of Apocalypse don't really understand horror, believing, apparently that special effects and graphic destruction create terror. They don't."
2,An embarrasment to the Horror/Action genre,"I love the Resident Evil video games. But this movie is sssssoooooooooo dumb I almost started laghing. This is the story line,""O crap, the zombies are attacking!"" Than the shooting begins. And it continues through the whole movie, unceasing, unentertaining and unnessary. This is one of the worst movies of last year. So why, you may ask, did I give it two stars. Cuz the comic relief is hilarious! Me and my freind laghed the whole movie. Trust me, if you really want zombie killin action, buy a video game like Resident Evil, siren, The Suffering, or House of the Dead. If you really want a movie, buy the first Resident Evil Movie, its not great, but its infinately better."
4,Much better than some of the negative feedback...,"I enjoyed this movie from beginning to I think the end or was it the beginning. This film was terrific and I loved it except the end was not really the end, instead it positioned itself as chapeter two of ?? don't know how many more, but I hope it will be released soon. Don't like paying for a whole movie and finding out it is not the whole one. The Movie was done well, and lots of the same and more from the fist flick. Yep, it is worth buying."
1,Play the game instead !,"I watched it till the middle and wanted to throw it away.I't's an insult to the game.The acting was terrible.The story line was obvious and uninteresting.It was generally meant for those who had played the game.but I can promise you that if you have played resident evil three, you will find nothing to intrest you here.The game has more drama, more suspense more interesting and intelligent twists that the movie appalingly lacked.In my oppinion the movie itself was a good introduction, I hope the next movie will take up from there and give us something worth watching!!!!"
2,Wasted opportunity,"This isn't a bad zombie movie, but then again it isn't a good one either. Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this casehowever the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we theviewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)"
2,Better then the first...but that's not saying much.,"Paul Anderson shouldn't be allowed in hollywood period. The guy can't direct, and he can't write a good movie.His second try at the Resident Evil series, while better then the first, is still crap compared to REAL horror movies. It's kinda like asking to be kicked in the nuts once instead of twice...ones better but who really wants either option?I guess this is fine though for people who can't handle the real horror movies, like 15 year old girls and horny guys who only want to stare at the hot main star. It's generic and cheap looking at times, much more so then the budget would suggest.I would only recommend this if you can't handle real horror, or if you've already seen all there is to see in the form of horror movies."
5,Great,Love this series of movies I think the plot in each one is fabulous and MIla does a great job.
4,The VHS price?,"Resident Evil Apocalypse was a good movie based on the third Resident Evil game. But, did anyone notice that there's only one VHS tape in stock and it's selling for $105?"
4,res evil apocal.,"It was fricken awesome if you like action from a ""super"" or ""specially abilitied"" hottie. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this ""on the edge of your seat, matrix/alien style action packed"" movie."
5,awesome,this movie is an awesoem movie.... i wont go into what happens because it is covered in other reviews.....but if you go into a ZOMBIE movie thinking that this is going to be a highly thought out practical movie you are a RETARD...... this movie has tons of action sexy people and a fun plot line..... if you want a movie that has action this is it
1,Looks like this one is going to bomb.,Another movie based on a horror video game francise. Skip it and save your money unless you are a 13 year old gamer.
1,Resident Evil - Apocalypse (A Sick Joke),"This Paul Anderson is a really funny guy. Every script he puts his hands on turns to crap. OMG this movie was just horrible. Come on people why are yall even giving this guy your money. Movies are not supposed to suck. The more money yall give to this guy the more movies hes going to make. And this it a bad thing BTW.Don't buy this DVD or rent it. The first R.E. was good but could of been better. But this one is OMG just horrible. Lets just hope that the next R.E. movie going to have a diffrent movie director.Just pass on this one, OK!!!"
2,The Horror Just Ended...,"To say this movie was a good, successful one would in fact be a lie. In my opinion this was a terrible sequel to a movie that I adore. For starters, it is unrealistic in its approach to situations presented in the Resident Evil world, and by taking away Alice's feminine vulnerability it detracts from her character a heck of a lot.The staged characters that are in the games are nothing like their counterparts. Jill, for one, does not do the character justice at all, nor does Carlos. And can I say that the other characters while at first seemed interesting, were killed off far too quickly to develop any emotional attachment to them.The pace of the movie was too fast and it was not easy to catch on to what we are supposed to be seeing. Not only that, but every five seconds it seemd like there is a fight scene that has no purpose what-so-ever as opposed to the balanced feel of it's predecessor.Overall I am very dissapointed with this title, and I would not recommend it at all!"
2,Worse than the first one...,"Shocking! Of course, i tried to take it on it's good points. Before i saw it i was looking forward to seeing the movies translation of nemesis. It was CRAP! There's no other word for it, sorry to anyone who may have found that rude, but it was a big guy in a suit. The movies neither scared me, thrilled me, or even interested me at parts. But as i always say, it may be to some people's liking so check it out if you liked the first one. All in all, i didn't like either. I'm glad i still have the games to give it a good name. Enjoy!"
1,Hollywood at its worst!,The first movie was very good although it did not have the same impact as the game did. This sequal however was the worst piece of storytelling I have seen on screen.Don't waste your money...
1,Worst Movie Of the Year,"What is this trash? Anyone who thinks this movie is any good must be insane. I don't care who liked the videogame, this is supposed to be a movie. The dim-witted plot is carried out so drudgingly, it bores me to tears. How superficial can a film be? This kind of trash is only suitable for possessed retards with anxiety dysfunctions. The movie deserves not only the lowest rating possible, but it begs submission to the Golden Turkey Award, where it would gladly see some glory. Either that or the makers should have their heads examined.For the parents with genuine concerns that gullibly think videogame violence is the root of leading teens astray and decide to connect this movie to it, this piece of unadulterated garbage is a three-pointer for them."
2,Okay I guess.,When are people going to learn how to make a decent video to screen adaption?? Have'nt seen it yet and I don't think I will. Sorry but I will stick with the games.
3,killed it.,"okay this movie was as bad as the first when it came to staying true to the game. first of all this is what really happends in the RE storyline: theres no alice, jill get stalked by nemises and gets infected with the virus in the game carlos meets her and helps her get the vaccine. then Jill is forced to beat nemises in the end with guns no genetically enginnered crap on her.Oh when yousee that part near the end when alice runs away in a building and a copter is shooting at her thats stolen from the character claire redfield in RE code veronica. i can go on, but fans get what i mean, its just an attemp to stay true to the game, yeah right!As for people who dont play the game maybe you will like it some of my friends did. But to me another sucky video game movie. the games RULE."
5,Executed well against low expectations,"Perhaps the only movie that could come in with lower expectations of an adaptation of a video game is the sequel to an adaptation of a video game. Despite (or perhaps because of?) such low expectations, the movie was remarkably well done. The twists and turns of the plot were interesting, and not 100% predictable. There was advancement of the broader story line of the t-virus: A bioweapon that happens to turn the infected into flesh eating zombies. Sounds simplistic? Well, the story has more to it than that.Even from a non-zombie afficianado, it was a sequel worth watching. Not a Casblanca classic, but perhaps in 20 years this will still be watched as a cult classic."
5,Great movie!!,I have always been a fan of these movies and never owned them before. The price was great and it allowed me to get both movies at 1 low price!!
4,"Not the best out of the 3 series, but OK.","It's good with enough action, but I think they went a little overboard with the superpowers. But the additional cast who portray good guys does give it more fun to watch."
1,"Not a good transfer, but at least it was free.","I don't understand all the good reviews of this movie. The blu-ray transfer is not good. The movie looks grainy and blurry in some parts. It was almost like looking a standard DVD. And about the movie itself, it's very bad! If you want a good blu-ray transfer look further. I'm glad that this movie was free with the purchase of the PS3 because I wouldn't pay for it (not even as a rental).The Resident Evil video games are better than this movie."
5,Great,"Great movie, just needed this one to complete the full line up! Watch this series of movies in order to get the most out of it,"
3,Better Than the First One!,"Okay it has bad dialogue and many flaws, but If you like the games then you will love how thism ovie was made! Zombies, lickers, and Nemesis!!!!STARSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"It sure is fun, but the first one was better!","Milla Jovavich is back as @$$kicking Alice in the sequel to 2002's `Resident Evil'. In `Apocalypse' we are given more of the same but it doesn't seem to really perform as well as the first film. The sets aren't as exciting or as memorable, and the inclusion of Nemeses may excite some it left me a bit stale. Milla is still as great and as fun as ever, and new to the game stars like Sienna Guillory (who plays video game favorite Jill Valentine) and Oded Fehr do a fine job of supporting her but the real stars are the CGI effects which work well for the most part. Expect lots of action and lots of blood but with Michelle Rodriguez's snappy Rain missing and the lack of originality found in the first `Resident Evil' film `Apocalypse' just isn't strong enough to warrant it's own following. Maybe three's a charm."
5,"GTA Bi$#h, 10 Points..","Resident Evil - Apocalypse is the best video game to movie I have ever seen since the original Mortal Kombat. If your a horror film nutt then you'll enjoy this movie (I sure did). The acting is on point with the special effects. There are plenty of video game creatures in this one, zombies dont run in this film (thanx god), if you seen House of the Dead (stupid, stupid film) then you no what Im talkin about. Paul Anderson is also doing a 3rd film called Resident Evil - Afterlife, which will probably be the last film in the series.. check out this movie because RE RULES..."
1,The movie stop playing a few minutes in,"The movie Resident Evil Apoloyscape just stop playing a minute into it. Tell me, How do I get a refund."
2,Stick with the first movie,"The first Resident Evil surpassed my expectations and is actually an entertaining little zombie flick that I am proud to have in my zombie movie collection. Apocalypse started out awesome and then completely fell apart like 20 minutes in. This movie is just all over the place. When making a zombie movie, please stick to the zombies. We dont need to see the main character fist fight a cyborg/human/alien that carries a grenade launcher. Just shoot it in the head. The whole plot was just ridiculous. Im not even gonna try to explain it to you. This movie could have been great, they had such good material to work with. I cant believe they let it devolve into this mess."
3,"Great movies, good DVD, Deceptive advertising","I am a fan of the Resident Evil Movie franchise. This DVD 2 pak is great. The seller and Amazon were both phenominal. The only problem I have is with the way the movie itself was marketed as having a bridge between movies 2 and 3. There is a special feature called ""Bridge to Extinction"" but it does not give you anymore information on what happens at the end of Apocalypse, to what happens at the beginning of Extinction than you would understand from just watching both movies. If your looking to see what happens to Valentine, or understand what happened in Detroit, you still won't know after seeing the ""Bridge""."
4,Blu-ray Resident Evil ... WOW!,"Same movie, definite upgrade on visuals and sound. You have to have the 1080P TV and Dolby Digital capability, otherwise just buy the DVD."
3,Excellent Audio and Video,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was excellent. It looked like it was recorded digitally, it looked so good, and I'm sure it was. It appeared to be presented in 2.40:1, so there were black bars at the top and bottom, which is how I prefer movies to be.The Dolby Digital 5.1 was about the best sound I have ever heard. There was also PCM 5.1, but no DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, or Dolby TrueHD 5.1. This Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack had better surround sound than most DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Blu-Rays. Lot's of sub-woofer bass also.The movie itself was just okay. Lot's of action, violence, and blood & guts. I was glad it was only 1 hour and 27 minutes long."
3,Silly action with entertaining value,"With the success of the original movie, Resident Evil. I find myself seeing the sequel to it, Resident Evil: Apolcalypse. With low expectations I found that this movie was silly, filled with action, and didn't have much character development nor a very good atmosphere that usually makes up a great film. With that said, the movie was still good enough to be enjoyed as an entertaining movie. With another solid acting job as the hero, Milla has convinced me that she belongs as a bad-ass super-hero."
4,UMD for PSP Review - Good Movie,"This review is really aimed more at the UMD version for the PSP. If you want a review of the movie, there are plenty of those here...After placing the UMD in the PSP, it's immediately obvious that even at full volume, the built-in audio for the PSP just won't cut it for movies. The dialog is barely audible, while the explosions, gunshots, etc. are blaring. To combat this, try a couple of things:1. Access the movie menu and increase the volume output2. Turn off the volume limiter3. Use some external speakers or headphones4. Turn off the EQ - EQ should be flatI used some speakers for the movie, and the experience was great. I hadn't seen the movie before, and it looked great on the PSP's screen. Of the PSP's UMD titles available, this is one of the better ones."
4,Apocalypse suceeds,"It was the most watched trailer from May 2004-July 2004. The first movie was the most critically acclaimed zombie movie for excellent makeup and extreme sucess of a game to movie transition. RE:A has again, showed the audience that the Resident Evil series has great potential on another media. RE:A, unlike the first film, describes in depth the sinister acts of the Umbrella Corporation, the larges commercial entity in the world. Alice, the main character, has survived but it changed because of T-virus cells implanted within her body. She is now the strongest warrior ever imagined. The film also succedes in linking the 3rd game with well known characters such as Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera. This movie is kickass, with women wearing short skirts, gigantic monsters with a handheld mini gun, and zombies galore. I reccomend it to all Resident Evil fans, Zombie fans, and espcially the action die hard fans. They will not be dissapointed"
1,"If ""Sucks"" could be re-named it would be Resident Evil 2","Someone forgot to tell the writer that there needs to be a story line after 10 minutes into the movie, at least one that could be followed. RE2 started out with some promise and rapidly fell apart. I was a big fan of RE1 and of the games but someone needed a quick car payment and sold out all of the fans and gave us this piece of crap. The 2 things that made the movie were Jill Valentine and the Special Effects. But even Jill's smokin hot body could not hold my attention for too long. If you have to see it don't pay full price or better yet wait for the video and ignore it also."
1,nemisis?,"this is probally one of the most stupid movies i have ever seen. the first one was actually good, this movie was so fake and stupid."
3,Twice the budget.. half the movie of the first,"With twice the budget, this movie is only half as good as the original Resident Evil.The problem ?Resident Evil like most ""Zombie""-related films get their appeal from the feeling of dread derived by being pursued relentlessly by massive hordes of living dead.In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we get about 8 minutes of zombies at the beginning and 2 minutes at the end.The rest of the movie revolves around our band of heroes fighting the Umbrella Corp. Security Team.Call it ""Matrix Meets Resident Evil"".Not as entertaining as the first by any means."
5,RESIDENT EVIL 2,NOW THAT'S A REAL RESIDENT EVIL MOVIE AND THIS TIME IT'S JUST LIKE THE GAME EVEN BETTER
2,As Cool as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!,"Please read this review before you decide if it's helpful or not. Seriously, I played the games they are fun, I saw the first film, it was pretty good, this one does not have much going for it. If you want a good shoot-em-up Zombie film see the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" or even the great comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"". Both of those movies will give you so much more than this one. The ""Lickers"" in the Church is a good scene, and a brief scene with Zombie Hookers is cool, and that is the two stars I give it. Nemesis (The huge monster villian in this movie) looks no better than a Power Rangers creature I kid you not, and the acting is non-existent. If you are the kind of person that will enjoy anything with the ""Resident Evil"" tag you may like it just fine, but people with a higher-standard on their action/horror films REALLY should look elsewhere..........the Zombie Hookers are cool though."
2,Resident Evil- Apocalypse Now,Was unfortunate that the last 30-40 mins the dvd was messed up... kept stopping and slowing down- distortion etc.
5,RE2 YA!!!,First off I am a big RE fan but when the first movie came out I thought it would be like the game but... you know how that ends It wasnt like Re1 It was kinda like RE and that Alyssa charicter wtf wheres Jill?Barry?Chris?and Wesker OR TYRANT geez but Resident Evil Apocalypse Is basically playing Resident Evil 3 Nemisis just like in the first the guy got clawd and hes turning into the Nemisis I think this one will blow the first one away so go see this movie I know I will
1,Ok lets combine...,"Ok lets combine the cliches of movies that came out between 2000-2004,running down a building I mean come on,why dont they just have vin diesel jump out of an airplane on a motorcycle with a girl grabbing on to him covered in syrup crash fly glide into a building while playing whiny nu-metal where the lyrics consist of ""And a whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ah!""where all the sudden an explosion appears and it says THIS SUMMER (crash again) V-v-v-v-vin diesel!(crash)Anyways dont see this movie,I commend capcom for ruining zombies though."
2,Not even close to the original,"I would like to say that I am surprised by the responses that this movie was better than the first. It was terrible, it had lousy acting and the plot was extremely confusing.What is up with the dead people coming out of the ground in the cemetary? The virus is spread through a bite or getting injected with it. This movie was terrible...No story line, The action was lame too.."
2,Where is Anderson???,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a LOUD, vulgar, obnoxious work of celluloid that completely lacks the style and atmosphere of Paul W.S. Anderson's first film. The sound design is ridiculously over the top, the script is non-existent and the FX are sub-par. The eagerly awaited ""Nemesis"" looked like a man in a rubber mask and the ""Lickers"" appeared as if they had been crafted from 1st generation CGI circa ""Alien III."" I was hoping for more and was ultimately disappointed..."
3,3.5 stars (slipt in the middle),"thought its ok slipt in the middle about it, it had its moment of good scenes but i have seen worst when they are doing sequels"
3,3 and 1/2 Stars,"I don't usually go in for zombie movies, but I did see the first one and didn't hate it. I liked this one much better than the first one mostly because of the action and the interaction between the characters. I liked the fact that the women kick ass and I'm a sucker for Oded Fehr ever since The Mummy movies. And, well, Mila may be a skinny-ass model, but she's highly likeable just as in The Fifth Element. The movie does seem to set up for yet another chapter in the Resident Evil saga, but I think it's highly unlikely that there will be one."
3,Can't wait for the third installment,"This movie had better actions scenes and a more interesting plot. There were more emotions in the actors. I felt that one of the actresses, whom ever played Jill, wasn't up to par. The ending of the movie was another cliff hanger just like the first one. It leaves you wanting more."
4,"Plot, check. Gore, check. Ending, WAIT A MINUTE!!!!!","The second installment in the Resident Evil movie series delivers a punch that equals the first. With more language, more guns, and WAY more zombies, you better break out the popcorn. I rented this expecting it to be pretty cheesy and worth a few laughs. I was wrong. Now, it never really SCARED me too much, but it was still a great movie. The scene in the church with the lickers is pretty good. The special effects are awesome, the acting was phenomenal, but the ending...well, to put it bluntly, the ending was about as good as a pile of 2-day old dog feces. It leaves the story open to a sequal, but the climax of the movie made me remember AVP.... So, overall, 4.3 stars, the ending was just not good. But a fun buy for anyone. Just keep it away from any kids under 11."
3,good genre flick,"One of the best parts about this movie is the clear indication that Milla Jovovich is on her way to being one of the first major female action-movie stars. She comes across as tough and kick-*ss as she should be as Alice, an enhanced fighting machine who can help residents of Raccoon City who have been locked in by the Umbrealla Corporation to contain an outbreak of T-Virus, which is turning everyone around them into zombies. There are some good action sequences (I have a soft spot for seeing zombies getting kung-fu'ed out of their socks, okay?) and some over the top mid-air explosions and such which bring down the interest some, but of course the big element played in this sequel, much like the original, is the intrigue of the plans of Umbrella. It's enough to keep watching to make this an above-average action-zombie-bad-coproration flick, though still in the end a genre piece that does not challenge the genre much."
4,A Good Look at the Various Ways to Interpret Hitler,"This was a good book. The author did a nice job looking at, and evaluating the many theories on Hitler. I especially enjoyed the chapter on Hitler's Willing Executioners. Hitlers Willing Executioners makes an important point, but is impossible to read. This book did a nice job explaining the work in plain English. Also the book has an interesting chapter on David Irving. I also really enjoyed the chapters dealing with Hitler's sexuality and Freudian Interpretations. Again, this book is a great overview of the many ways to look at Hitler."
3,Annoying writing style,So deliberately journalistic and breezy that its breeziness becomes an annoyingly disingenuous style of its own.
2,There are better books on Hitler and the Holocaust.,"I give Rosenbaum credit for rejecting the apologists and the psychoanalysists, and reaffirming that Hitler was responsible for his actions and was a profoundly evil person. However, his book falls far short of explaining the Holocaust or why German people helped Hitler to carry out his final solution. At the end of this book, Rosenbaum has failed to ""explain"" much of anything, but has done little more than to merely ""describe.""I recommend Leonard Peikoff's _The Ominous Parallels_ for a truthful explanation of the Holocaust, and and introduction to the only philosophy which can prevent it from happening again."
2,Fascinating idea if you can wade through the prose,"Quite frankly, I agree with the professional journalist/copy editor. I have been slogging through this book for much longer than normal. I find the information quite interesting but the prose and writing is HORRIBLE! I, too, am quite convinced that the author sat down with a dictionary with the goal of using every obscure word he could find."
1,very weak and poorly researched,"The title ""Explaining Hitler"" is particularly poor for this book since the author is not in any position to explain why the various explanations given for how Hitler came to be are tenable or not. The chapter entitled ""Dark Matter"" is particularly weak, whereas it should have been at the very core of the book. In an attempt to summarize the Freudian psychoanalytic ""explanation"" for Hitler, the author bases his entire argument around one cause, that Hitler may or may not have had only one testicle. The author may be surprised to learn that psychoanalytic studies of pathological personalities such as Hitler usually contain more substance than ""a one ball theory""."
1,"Shall we? Yes, It's time.","This book is 'torture', only overtaken by Robert Waite's 'The Psychopathic God - Adolph Hitler' and enema/water-boarding combinations.What do you say that we 'explain' Hitler differently than the conformist and media-darling writers and historians do. It's about time a new and more realistic understanding of Hitler take center stage. Dump this book and read Stolfi's 'Hitler: Beyond Evil and Tyranny'.It's refreshingly new and closer to the truth than the predictable pulp-mill tabloid history we've been brain-washed with.It's about time."
4,A wonderful book--but only if you're open to ideas,"I am 39 years old and have a Ph.D. in English. Though the syntax may be occasionally flawed, the provocative ideas and insights are first rate. The wealth of information and depth of discussion should stimulate the intellect of all who would demonstrate a willingness to forego the foolish consistency that is the hob-goblin of little minds."
2,"Insufficient ""explanation""","Fairly standard, and tediously predictable examination of the subject of ""evil"" that casts no light on this darkest of subjects, but only offers opinion and typically unenlightening psychological babblings.Better to read Walter Charles Langer's ""The Mind of Adolf Hitler"" if you want insight into the morally barren landscape of the fuehrer's mind. As for the origins of evil, sorry secularists, but there's only one place to look, and that's the Bible."
3,Leaves out an important perspective,"This book does a good job trying to explain the rise of Hitler, but it leaves out the only perspective that completely explains Hitler in its own terms without having to confront the limitations of its own worldview when faced with such catastrophic evil - Hitler was controlled and empowered by Satan, and was a forerunner of the Anti-Christ. On the surface, this view is idiotic to today's secular society. But it's the only view that completely explains Hitler within the context of its own worldview, while secular, ""educated"" perspectives fail. Something to think about."
3,"interesting contents, unreadable prose","The content is interesting (4.5), the text does not read (1). Full of obscure words, clumsy syntax. Should be rewritten with readability in mind, then I will give it a higher mark."
3,a bit too parochial,"The author has done a very good job of digging out some fascinating nuggets of information about Hitler, such as the Henry Ford connection and the possiblilty that Hitler was an offical mourner at the funeral of a Jewish socialist a matter of months before becoming a Nazi. I had expected to see a contrast of Hitler's background or upbringing with Stalin's/Pol Pot's/Mao's to try and find a common threads. One of the saddest comments on the 20th century is that the atrocities of Nazi Germany are perhaps not as unique as the author seems to think, & I was disappointed that the book had less comparison with other personalities that perpetrated state-sponsored mass murder."
5,"Brilliant, unput-downable!","Previous commentators have summarized the book. What I'd like to speak about is the terrifying brilliance of the writing. Rosenbaum has a piercing intellect and also a gift for language -- a rare combination. Reading this book I felt I was accompanying a brilliant man on a very important quest -- indeed, the quest of his life. His obsssion with trying to explain Hitler became my obsession. I felt total identification with his journey. For me the book had the drama of a very good novel, with Rosenbaum the detective-protagonist and a viable ""Hitler explanation"" the solution to a great mystery. This is not only an important work on account of its content, but is also a terrific piece of literary journalism. A must-read for anyone disturbed by the notion of an ""inexplicable Hitler"" and for anyone, too, who is intrigued by the drama of a personal quest."
4,"Great Information, Egghead Writing","The information in this book is excellent. That being said, the prose is at times absolutely outlandish. The introduction gives you a cue of what's to come as the author gives you a ""Dennis Milleresque"" outline of the facts. After he used the term ""Heathcliffian"" I knew I may be in over my head. I ended up keeping my Franklin electronic dictionary next to the book to define the plethora of odd synonyms used.It's worth the dollars. Just prepare to feel uneducated."
4,Great book but dismissed one big point,"This is a thought provoking book however, Mr. Rosenbaum too easily dismisses the physical and emotional abuse aspects of Hitler's early life. He writes off the Alice Miller and OSS theories with a few brisk paragraphs. Hitler's abuse symptons are clear: incredible anger/rage, blaming others for his life unhappiness, messianic vision, social disconnection, greater empathy for dogs and animals than people, lover of sweets and chocolates, and sexual dysfunction. The sad part is that Hitler in his November 1918 hysteria fit was finally able to channel his rage into an Enemy that would give him a purpose. This of course was the ""Jewish Race"" and other sub humans."
4,Intelligent and provocative,"This is a book quite different to any other book I have read before. It is probing, controversial and, speculative. It has a philosophical bent to it and will make you think.The book revolves not only about Hitler but also about the Holocaust and the Germans. Before reading this book, I happened to read Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's ""Hitler's willing executioners"". Goldhagen puts the Holocaust's responsibility squarely on the Germans but ""Explaining Hitler"" goes deeper and entertains the additional possibility that ""no Hitler, no Holocaust"".The book has somewhat long chapters that sometimes feels were written in a haphazard fashion and, as a result of this, it is not a reader friendly book as far as reading mechanics go."
2,Don' let the title fool you!,"When I purchased the book I thought it would atleast attempt to explain Hitler. Rather than that, the book focuses on other people's attempts to explain the unexplainable mind of Hitler. While the book does have its good moments, I found it to be uninteresting at best. Rosembaum seems noncommittal and at times even afraid to present his own ideas about the subject. For a insightful and thought provoking book try Hitler:The Psychopathic God or other books by the men that Rosembaum critisizes."
1,wrong specs,"The spec on amazon said 80% cotton, but the mix was totally different on the label of what I received."
2,Bits and Pieces of Useful Info,"Pros:- Variety of topics covered including fund raising, recruiting, mental, and play aspects- Advice from several sources- A handful of good tables and info-graphicsCons:- In many cases, about 1/2 of each chapter consists of the given ""expert"" telling you why they are ""great."" I realize they are probably trying just trying to establish their value as an expert on the subject, but it's very annoying.- Rather than properly developing ideas a coach can use for his or her own team, there are brief overviews of some ideas and other ideas are often repeated only with different wording in later chapters.- I found the chapter on pitching especially horrible.This book is called ""The Softball Coaching Bible"", and indeed, in the sense that The Bible is a collection of stories being retold with a greater purpose, this book holds true. However, if your intent for this book is as a manual, then I recommend you pass on it and check out some of the other books out there."
3,Interesting,This is geared more towards high school and college coaches. But any coach can take something away from it. Great concepts from great coaches.
1,Only if you want to read something.,Not real helpful. If you have never watched a game of baseball or softball this might be helpful. Didn't finish it as I had to go coach. Maybe a winter read when there is nothing else to do.
5,Haunting and Lovely,"I've had this record for years and listened to it hundreds of times. I never get tired of it. Victoria De Los Angeles has it all. She is moving, mysterious and melencholic and then exciting and brassy. ""Songs my Mother Taught Me"" can move me almost to tears."
4,"The fun things in life: Torture, Murder & Assassination","Conrad Bland has finally found a world that accepts him. Bland is a man so evil that evil needs to be redefined to describe him. Having perpetrated atrocities on several worlds, he finally comes to Walpurgis III. Here, where Satanism, witchcraft, and black magic are the norm, many hail him as a hero, and he revels in his freedom to torture and murder. But, not everyone is so enamored of him, and they have dispatched the galaxy's best assassin to terminate Bland. Detective John Sable picks up the trail of the assassin, and must decide whether to stop him, or let him continue with his mission. He will be forced to face his own inner fears and demons, and make an irrevocable choice, for good or evil."
2,A Shadow of the Future,"Along with Patrick O'Brian Mike Resnick is my favorite author. I love his satirical, cynical, ironic style as seen in his later works. This novel gives us an insight into the development of the style found in such works as Santiago, Birthright, the Widowmaker series, etc."
5,Very good TD,"Having owned the CD for a few years I have recently re-listened to it over and over. What a treat! It is as rich, textured, and substantial as anything TD has done. As opposed to some of their other CD's, which have not aged well, this one is filled with swirling soundscapes which are as powerful as anything they have done. To my amazement most of the electric lead guitar, which makes the album work, is by Gerald Gradwohl, whom I've never heard of! (Clearly I was 'asleep at the wheel' on this one.) If you like the sound of mysterious, serious and brooding TD, then you will like much of this wonderful disc."
3,A pleasant listening experience.,"I believe that I bought Tyranny of Beauty when it was first released a few years ago. I've never listened to it much, but I still regard it to be a satisfactory album. Every track is listenable. The ones that I like the most are ""Stratosfear 1995,"" ""Largo,"" and ""Living in a Fountain Pen."" ""Living in a Fountain Pen"" contains some nice guitar playing to it. Tyranny of Beauty is pretty good and worth a listen."
5,Great Album,"My first album was Le Parc back in 1985, and this was an evolution from previous albums. The heavier guitar riffs and powerful notes rung out and Stratosphere 1995 is a song I haven't heard in 9 years and one of the best songs ever from Tangerine Dream."
3,"Mostly a steady stream of Froese, saved by Xerxes","Not their best, but listenable. On close inspection most of the tracks have quite a lot of the same sound, beat, instruments, and melody range. To be expected, perhaps, given that 8 of the 9 songs were penned or co-written by Edgar Froese and / or Jerome Froese. They have their style, and it involves a lot of embroidery with wailing electric guitars and airy synth sounds. The most delightful (to me) track is the last, ""Largo - (from Xerxes)"", which is TD's rendition of a very nice bit of Handel's work. The mixture of acoustic and electronics instruments gives this familiar piece a languid, dreamy sound."
3,Not what I wanted,This thing is HUGE! I realize it's my own fault for not reading the description more closely. I wanted something more low-key to display our family photos or Christmas cards.
3,Creatures in the River,"A small book, packed with drawings, scientific references and keys on river biota. It's a bit old, 1962. Challenges you to get out there and do your own collecting and tells you what equipment to have. I was hoping for more description on the ecology of rivers, i.e. who eats who. But any lack there is mine, for not reading more carefully."
3,AVH-P3400BH,So I purchased the Pioneer P3400 and well got this harnes... the receiver turns on and all... but no sound.. any ideas?
4,Guns of Navarone - Complete Dimitri Tiomkin Film Score,"This music is very fine - I particularly appreciated the fact that the theme song is vocalized, as well as the short verse that is sung at the very end of the movie as the end titles are displayed."
1,Fell Apart,"I was originally really excited about the Racour double rack, but it had two major problems.First, I could not find a way to arrange two bicycles so that their pedals and/or handlebars didn't clash. As a result, the rack only held one bicycle at a time.That said, my bicycle weighs a grand total of 23 lbs. I am a cycle commuter so the rack gets used every day. One day, after about 3 months of use, I went to hang up my bike and noticed that one of the welded joints was loose. Upon inspection, the whole lower part of the rack fell off.So I can't say I'm totally pleased with it."
4,Great product just be sure to instal properly,I have two of these and have two very different bikes on them. My carbon Franco Balcom barley posses any challenge to this stand. My 1987 Raleigh flexes it a bit but it holds strong. The first time I put it up my Raleigh tore right out of the wall but that was my fault since I didn't put it in a stud. So be sure you to mount in a proper location or it will do the same to you.
3,Works but seems fragile,"I used this for about 6 months until I remodeled the garage. The mounting piece is very small, creating a very strong lever. When I hung the bicycle for the first time, it put so much pressure on the sheetrock that screw heads starting ""coming out"" along the stud. I was always super careful not to push on the bicycle out of fear that the screws, or stud, or wallboard was going to break. After remodeling the garage, I decided not to use this."
1,Bike rack review,"Beautifully designed, however the rack did not support the weight of a specialized mountain bike. The rack bent and was unstable looking."
2,Returned Untried,"I returned this rack. Its design is questionable for the long-run. The materials are pretty light and its attachment point way too small to resist the continuing torque or twisting motion that comes with loading and off-loading a 29# or heavier bike. It's price is attractive, but over time it will likely disappoint. I substituted this rack:Feedback Sports Velo Wall Rack (Black)and have been very pleased with it. I reviewed that rack on 9 June 2012."
1,Avoid like the plague - no redeeming features whatsoever.,"I must say I'm amazed they're still selling these after my experience with them - suffice to say I'm in the market for a new rack.Like other 2 arm racks (see reviews of the ""Allen Wall Mounted 2 bike rack"") getting 2 bikes on here is a struggle. They have to be angled just right. Even then, the pedals interlock with something on the other bike and it's all a horrible mess.The rack itself has plastic coating over metal arms. In a few weeks the plastic coating on mine split and came off, so be prepared to do a home repair or risk scratching your bike.Worst of all was the mounting hardware. I used the supplied hardware to mount it to a brick wall in my garage. After a month (you're getting the picture right - longevity?) the damn thing pulled itself out my wall - bikes and all - and managed to scratch my car.I can think of no redeeming qualities of this piece of junk. You have been warned."
1,"Screws sheered/bent, welds came off.",Unfortunately this product comes with screws that sheered off with a screw driver after having drilled pilot holes. Then the welds attaching the two major pieces broke. No joy.
3,Only for Road Bikes,"It is a good concept and a good space saver but I wish it was stronger. The description on Amazon didn't mention anything about mountain bikes. This is clearly not a good rack for mountain bikes.I was planning to use it for a mountain bike and a road bike, but as soon as I put the first bike on it, all the screws came out! If you have a smaller bike or two very light road bikes, this might work, otherwise look for some other solution."
4,"good, but bike handles tilt",The rack provides basic mounting capabilities and works well with my Motobecane Cyclocross bicycle. My only problem with it is that there is no mechanism for preventing the handle bars from turning left or right while mounted so my tire often hits the wall and leaves marks. I guess this is a problem because I may not have complete balanced/leveled the rack system when I mounted it but I still think there should be something to prevent handlebar movement.
1,Does not work as advertised,"I attached this to the wall in my garage and put two men's mountain bikes on it. It was tight, but they definitely both fit on there, leading me to wonder why there were so many negative reviews saying this thing wouldn't hold two bikes.Everything was fine for a couple of months, and then today I came out and found my bikes in a heap on the floor, with this thing folded over like a piece of rubber.These are adult bikes, so they're not small, but they're not particularly heavy as far as bikes go, either. I certainly didn't think they were capable of bending steel (or whatever metal the back support of this thing is made of). If you're going to sell a double bike rack, it should be able to support the weight of two bikes. Otherwise I would have bought two single racks and been done with it. Now I've got two bikes leaning against a wall with big screw holes in it."
3,The bracket works but I had to replace the screws,One of the screws broke when I was installing it but one I bought some decent screws it worked well.
3,Wouldn't trust this with a mountain bike,"I've had this product for the past couple of weeks and it does its job for my lightweight racing bike, however I found that the supporting arms bend significantly under the load. With that said I would not trust putting any heavier bike on it."
4,Needed a way to store our bikes,"And this was the simple clean solution to do that. They are a ""touch"" flimsy but hold our light bikes very well. For the price these are great and when the bike is off them they fold up out of the way."
4,Decent rack but the way I use it during the season will change,Installation was easy. I chose to use real lagging bolts instead of the screws that came with it.This rack is a good deal and will store two bikes but they are crowded.During the off season I will use it for 2 bike storage.Come spring when the snow blowers are put away the road bikes will go up on the racks and the mtb will stay on the ground.FYI 1/4 x 1 1/2 inch lag bolts fit perfectly.
2,Only for road bikes and Came rusted,"First, this is -- as other reviewers have stated -- only for road bikes. Mountain, commuter, cruiser or hybrid bikes will not fit on this rack. The same is true for women's frames. Since these frame types represent the majority of bikes currently in the market, I think this is a serious drawback of this product and one that should be indicated prominently in the product description, if not the Product Title (i.e. it should be called a ""Folding Double Road Bike Rack"".I was also somewhat disappointed by the condition of the item. The hinge was rusty. I don't know if that impairs the strength of the rack, but it is not okay in a newly purchased product, and it did make the rack squeak when I folded it up and down. Also, two of the screws arrived stripped. Still I might have simply returned it for an exchange, if only our bikes had fit on it."
3,Great for storing bikes with no racks,I would give this storage system 5 stars if our bikes would fit on it with the racks we have attached. Our rear racks are for holding panniers or baby seat. Only one bike will fit on this product if you have a bike with rear rack. I like that there is just enough room to store helmets on the unit behind the bikes.
3,Just what i needed,Rack works great. I had a hard time getting the screws into the stud because I didn't have a posidrive screw driver. so i mangled the screws a little getting them in. The rubber coating on the arms is fragile too. I managed to damage it just with the weight of the bikes so i put some electricians tape over it to keep it from self-destructing. Other than that i love it. I put it up the wall enough to fit stuff under the bikes but not have to lift it too far to get the bike down. I'd recommend this to a friend but with reservations because of its minor failings.
5,Looks flimsy....,... but it holds my bike pretty well (and my bike is a little heavier than most). I was contemplating on ordering a more sturdy rack but I am glad I didn't! Good work.
4,Great product,"We had no problem installing it. It works as advertised. Delivery was prompt.I deducted one star, because the protective rubber around the steel rack tore within a few days of use and had to be replaced with tape."
1,does not work,"does not work, does not work, does not work, does not work , does not work , does not work, does not work. The screws they gave are junk, so I had to purcase longer wood screws.....ripping my garage wall apart......"
3,not a space saver,"It is easy to install and it holds the bike and it's been holding it fine. I suppose if you put it high up on the wall it may save some floor space but really, now I'm wondering why I bought it, except that the wheels won't stain my wall because I don't need to lean the bike against anything... I think I would like one that hangs the bike vertically rather than this one."
3,The garage is lookin' good,"I like the way the product works, but it feels a bit flimsier than I had thought it would. We bought 4 (one for each bike). I guess if they stand the test of time then I'll feel bad I didn't score them higher. It was a good price. They went up easily. I like the way they hold the bike and you can strap the helmet to the metal frame. I also like that you can fold them flat to the wall. I just don't like the way they bounce when I put up the bike. I keep thinking they are going to bend and drop the bike. Since that hasn't happened, I probably am worried for no good reason."
4,Works,"It does what it's supposed to - holds two of our bikes off the ground since we have limited space. The installation was odd because the product does not mount straight in order to get the top level, but we have had it for a while now and it is still sturdy."
2,Poor quality,Received the item on time.I started to install the rack on my garage wall and a weld broke.The weld is only a simple tack and was not suffient for the application. Poor engineering and poor welding technique leads to a failed product.
3,Great for Kids and BMX Bikes,I bought two of these one for my bike (single) and one for my kids small bmx. BMX works great.. My bike (normal just road bike you would find from a general store) it was up for about 10 minutes and the heads snapped off the included screws. So off to find a different product.
4,"Handy and elegant. Best for wood, not concrete.","Nice compact design, folds up fairly tight against the wall. I used it on a cinderblock and had a little trouble getting the anchors to hold as there's a considerable amount of force pulling out on the top screw... ended up supergluing the anchor and that held pretty well. Should do a lot better on a wooden or drywall with wood studs. Not sure if using it on a metal stud wall would work or not - I'd tend to say no unless you can get to the metal stud to through in a wood brace."
1,Crap!,"Unless your bike weights about 5-10 lbs. (like a kids bike?) this ""Pro"" item will be weighed down. Cheaply ""Made in China"" pretty much says it all. Buyer beware."
1,"Unstable, lacks durability.","I had this rack for just about a month before returning it.I had it fixed into a brick wall - so had to buy new anchors because the ones that come with it are puny. Even with the new anchors it came off of my wall in a couple of weeks (had 2 bikes on it). The holes in the rack aren't really big enough to hold anchors much bigger, so I don't know what you'd do....In terms of fitting bikes on it - I had 2 on it, but the outside one wouldn't sit properly, it sat with the front slightly raised and off the arms because I just couldn't get enough clearance.....pedals would get in the way, or handlebars resting on seats. I got enough for them both to sit there, just not quite 100% flat on the arms.Then there's the arms.....they come coated in a nice rubbarized(?) black plastic. Within a week it had started splitting and by the end of the month it had completely came off one of the arms and was shredded on the other. That was the final straw, so I returned it."
1,not for mountain bikes,"my bike was within the listed weight limits of the rack, and it broke under the weight of my bike.Buyer beware."
3,Will Not Work With Most Mountain Bikes,"This is a great bike mount, but the manufacturer fails to mention that it is not compatible with most mountain and women's bikes.When mounting two bikes, the second bike needs to go on facing the opposite direction as the first bike, otherwise the handlebars hit. A similar problem occurs with mountain or women's bikes because the top tube on such bikes is slanted downwards to the seat tube. This places the back wheel directly over the handlebar of the bike mounted on the inside station.The manufacturer could have solved this by dropping one of the arms on the inside or outside station down 2""-3"", but apparently they underestimated the popularity of mountain bikes and the prevalence of women who ride bikes."
4,Good Value bike storage,The best method to store bikes with no floor footprint I could find. I bought 3 of them to hold up 6 bikes. The only flaw is that there could be a little more space between bikes.
2,Not stable,The double is great even with 2 bikes b/c of the bottom support. This single rack is not well supported. Placed mountain bike and this rack bends a lot. I would suggest the double even for a single bike. This single might be okay for the lighter 10 speed bikes.
2,Kind of flimsy,"My mountain bike weighs 44 lbs and the rack was straining, so I decided not to even use it. I definitely would not trust it to hold a 50 lb bike."
2,Not for Mountain Bikes,"The rack will work fine for lighter bikes. Our two mountain bikes seem to strain the racks. One side hangs down under their weight, but still holds them up."
3,"Easy to build, not detailed","I found the model easy to assemble but it was surprisingly lacking in details. The decals fit poorly into their place on the plane (the tail decals are the worst, they are too big), and they are not readable. The logos are not detailed and authentic, it seems they don't have permission to use real USAF emblems and logos (i.e. unit patches)."
2,Killing kisses,Delia and Karina are competing against each other for everything. Their newest price is Vincent.One of very few Fear Street disappointments. No surprises here unfortunately. It was just boring...
4,R.L. Stine books are still cool!!!,"This book was very interesting.Right when I thought I had it figured out,it was something completely different.I've always loved R.L. Stine and this book didn't disappoint me at all.He has much better books,but this is still very great!"
1,Not for Youngsters,"My 8 year old grandson checked this book out of the elementary school library. Needless to say, the title made me suspicious as to the content. After I read it, his parents notified the school. It has now been removed. This type of book may be o.k. for adults, if they like this sort of story; however, it should not be allowed in schools. Wonder where kids are getting the ideas to shoot up classrooms and malls? Check out the books they're reading......"
2,There is no practical value to this book,"Hundreds of pages of insanely dense math with absolutely no practical information on how to apply chaos theory to the markets. In fact, the author seems to suggest that it may be impossible to use chaos theory as a prediction tool in the financial markets.This is akin to a recipe book written by someone who thinks cooking is impossible, so all he can really write about is grocery shopping. NOT recommended! A much better book is ""Trading on the Edge"" by Deboeck.The only cool thing about the book is that you can use it to impress your friends/enemies with the title and loads of arcane equations inside."
5,Leaps Tall Pillows,"Lori Ries' picture book taps into an age-old segment of family life: the big brother who seems like ""superkid"" to his younger sibling. And so...""Super Sam,"" who lifts toy trucks, leaps tall pillows, escapes teddy bears and, in the end, comes to little brother's rescue. Quick. Bouncy. Funny. Little siblings will love it. Solo kids will wish they had a super brother."
4,Sam book,"I have a son named Sam, so like to get him books with his name. This story has very few words on each page - most of the story line needs to be implied by deciphering what is going on in the beautiful illustrations. It is great for a 2 -3year old, but my 3 year old son will likely outgrow it by age 4. For now, he does enjoy it and even talks about Super Sam at other times - saying he is super sam when he put a towel around his shoulders, etc."
3,Not As Bad As You Might Think,"Not a horror picture, despite the title, but an Old-fashioned Dark House mystery where the murders are blamed on the late owner's ape (actually a chimp). The real murderer is Mischa Auer in an early role, far removed from the snobbish and refined characters he would later play. Rex Lease, a survivor of the silent era, is the nominal star (he would go on to appear in over 200 films, mostly westerns, and sometimes uncredited), along with Vera Reynolds, another silent film star who career ended shortly thereafter. The direction is static and the acting sometimes laughable, except for Willie Best, who plays the driver, Exodus. Best (here billed as Sleep `n' Eat, a name he frequently worked under in the early 30s) is again playing the cowardly stereotype, but his acting is heads and tails above the others, even Mischa Auer, who here appears as if he will never work again. A good example of early 30s low-budget film making and recommended for all film buffs."
2,"Yassuh, boss!","Gray market discs such as this offer no commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.THE MONSTER WALKS (1932) - Rex Lease, Vera Reynolds, Sheldon Lewis, Vera Reynolds, Wille BestOne of the most racially insensitive pictures of all time! Willie Best (as 'Sleep 'n' Eat') shucks 'n' jives his way through a lot of bug-eyed mugging and ""feets don' fail me now!"" dialogue. The story's last line is Best saying the monster monkey looks like his uncle! INCREDIBLE. Not for the politically correct. Gray market discs such as this offer no commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair."
5,Very good,"I like this book. It does not promise ""90% accurate signals"" or treat reader with condescension. It teaches three things: 1) ""swing trading"" methods, 2) how to pay attention, 3) never forget stop loss orders.The book itself is structured in three large parts: 1) W.D. Gann's approach to markets and trader's discipline, 2) examples of trading patterns from various commodities all the way from 19th century, 3) addendum from 1951 with some more details and clarifications.Some people complain that Gann's writing style is too monotonous and droning. It is true in the sense that he does not entertain. But he does cover more ground than all those easy-reading ""Trading for Dummies"" book which are typeset in triple space with large charts.Parts of this book and interpretations of Gann's methods are available on the web - but it is still nice to have it as a book."
5,Best body wash around,"I used Herbal Essences moisturizing body wash for years and then my local drug store stopped carrying it. I tried many other brands, only to be disappointed in the quality. Some were very expensive, some were bargain priced. Either I didn't like the smell, it came out of the bottles in huge glops, it barely came out of the bottles, or it lathered poorly. When I discovered I could order my old brand online, I was overjoyed. And, not disappointed. Herbal Essences has a very nice clean scent that is not overpowering or too sweet. It lathers beautifully, and it comes out of the bottle as it should. It is a no-brainer to rate this product with five stars."
2,Limited Value,"At least on a Mac (a quad core 2.66G Mac Pro) this card has limited value. It will only address two of the 4 firewire ports at a time. All 4 ports ""work,"" but they don't work concurrently. That makes the point of having a multiple-output device very limited. When I tried to boot my Mac with three drives connected and powered-on, the system failed to boot. If I boot with one or two drives powered up, it works inconsistently. If I boot with the drives off and power them up one at a time, making sure the OS (Leopard) identifies each drive before adding a new drive, the card will successfully load two drives and refuse to connect the 3rd drive. The 4th port is internal and, as such, useless."
5,Silly favorites CD,"For a preschooler who love music, this is a really cute CD. Full of fun songs and favorites. I bought a childs CD player with earphones, so that the toddler this was intended for could enjoy her CD, just like the big kids with their earphones!"
1,Beyond Grating,"This is by far the MOST ANNOYING rendition of children's music EVER! The songs themselves aren't the worst, but the voices are simply unbearable--they kind of remind me of obnoxious children saying ""nah, nah, nah, nah"" over and over again. The collection overall seems rather slow--too slow even to captivate my 18 month old daughter. She completely ignores it when it is on, and she generally loves all music. My advice is to skip this one."
2,Silly Favorites,"Overall I think the CD was good. However, compared to Disney Favorites and other Producers of the same songs, this CD was less entertaining and seemed to be of less quality."
2,Commonplace,"I should have read the reviews more carefully before I bought this book. I would have been happier with the original sheet music as these arrangements were uninteresting--basically embellishments that any pianist with some experience could add on their own. At least the sheet music would have included the words. If you are looking for arrangements with pizzazz (a little ""wow!"" factor here and there), don't buy this book."
4,"popular songs, florid arrangements","Mr. Coates does professional-sounding arrangements and tries to work with songs that are already popular--a big service to those of us struggling with improvisation. After a while all of these sound a bit alike, with lots of big right-hand chords and the melody in octaves up in the top register. I dropped a lot of this an octave to allow for poorly tuned pianos and older audiences, and because all those high notes tend to sound girly. Fiddle with the arrangements a bit, though, and you'll have music that even younger audiences will appreciate."
2,hard to get past first few chapters,"this author was highly recommended! Sorry it did not make the mark, plot was slow to start and never did finish the book on my Kindle. May try another Perry book but not in the near future."
3,book 3--1997--not one of my favorites,Peter Hatcher is a Las Vegas casino executive.His employers think he knows to much about theiraffairs.A husband/wife couple have been hired to kill him.This couple is so twisted and sick that you will hatethem from the beginning.

4,Living in the Shadows,"Thomas Perry's SHADOW WOMAN sets Jane Whitefield against two hunters who are out to kill Pete Hatcher.Pete is a likeable young man who has learned too much about the operation of his employers. Three men operate a Las Vegas casino, but are skimming from the take for various enterprises including providing funds to politicians for favors.Months into her marriage Jane is again in the field to save Pete's life, but at each turn she takes a hunter arrives to block her path. The pace is fast and furious as Jane fights to save her life, and her marriage.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I didn't think this book was quite as good as the previous Jane Whitefield novels. In the beginning of this story, Jane's heart wasn't really into helping her client disappear and my heart wasn't into reading about it. I found myself skimming pages looking for action. I found it hard to believe Jane would give up her exciting life as a guide to get married and settle down to a ""normal"" life. In the book preceding this one, I had been rooting for Jane and Carey to get together. But their romance in this story seemed flat and lackluster. The pace did pick up toward the end of the book and the conclusion was worth waiting for."
2,implausible details,"The book has a good story line, but is based on circumstances that just don't ring true. Who would take home a strange woman{a hit woman no less), give her a house key, his wife's clothes, allow her to make phone calls, search and bug his house, while he lies sleeping in the locked master bedroom? And the list goes on. Jane needs to shed that [individual] and get someone with a brain. I just didn't think the details supported the story line enough to make it believable."
2,"Thomas Perry, why did you do it?",Why did Thomas Perry turn the third novel of his entertaining series into a second rate romance novel? I could have done with a lot less of the character's agonizing over her marital obligations and a lot more of the action and suspense that made the first novels fun to read. I will pass on any more of this series that comes my way.
3,"Good, but not up to Perry's high standards","Shadow Woman is the third Jane Whitefield novel, coming after the brilliant Vanishing Act and it's equally good follow-up Dance for the Dead. This book isn't as good as the previous two. The beginning is electrifying (and also a very funny depiction of Las Vegas), the middle is slow and convoluted, but the ending--which redeems the book--is very suspenseful. The hired killers, Earl Bliss and Linda Thompson, are interesting villains, competent and tenacious but ultimately flawed. My biggest problem with the book--and the evolution of the series--is Jane's husband, Carey McKinnon. He's dull, and he's no help to Jane. I haven't read Perry's latest Jane Whitefield novel, but I'm hoping he dispatches with the husband. He's dragging down the whole series. Maybe Perry should unite Jane Whitefield with his fictional anti-hero, The Butcher Boy. Now that would make a slam bang thriller!"
3,mounting area needs improvement,"The finish and quality are OK. My complaint is that the two posts where is connects to the toilet should be cone shaped so they center in the mounting holes in the toilet. As it is a flat surface, the seat can slide around a bit unless you tighten the mounting nuts to the point is about to crack the toilet. My previous seat made by American Standard had cone shaped mounting posts and was rock solid."
2,Nice looking but not strong,"This toilet seat matches the color of our toilet perfectly, which was the primary reason for purchasing it. It looks nice and functions fine, but as other reviewers have stated, it broke within a year of use. The wooden ring that you sit on broke on one side, rendering it useless and forcing us to purchase another seat. I am not sure why it broke. Perhaps it is cheaply made with particle board or needs more supports under the seat (instead of just the two that is has in the front)."
1,Snapped in half (one side),"Looks great. Hardware is good. But the seat itself is made of particle board and it snapped in half (on one side). I am below 200 lbs, but sat down too fast. If they are going to use brittle low strength materials, then they need to add more supports on the bottom."
1,sundown,"Here's what you need to know. Received seat with lid mounted off center to seat. One edge of lid is flush with seat, opposite edge is 1/2"" inside of seat edge.Color of this particular item is sunlight. For 48.69 (tax included) they can put this seat where the sun don't shine. The carelessness in assembly of this item makes it worth $5 not $48."
5,Remarkable,My husband and I have been using this product for fifteen years. This product Cosamin DS has helped my husband from the first time of trying it. He was not able to get up in the morning because of pain he had . After using it the first few weeks he found it to work very well. He would not do without this product. It has stopped all his pain. I would and have recommended this product to all who have a problem.
5,COSAMIN DS,My mom can't live without these great supplements. She says her joints hurt a lot when she runs out of these and there is absolutely no substitute.The pain drastically stops when you take these and I recommend them to anyone with arthritis or any joint pain related issue. I live in Guatemala and buying these pills in Amazon is as easy as point and click. Product arrived nicely packed and factory sealed. Will definately purchase here again as soon as we run out of pills!
4,A spirited well-sung performance,"Although modern instruments are used here the playing is spirited and the style has a good baroque feel. The singers are deservedly famous and are at their best here, but Robert Tear isn't well suited to the evangelist's recitatives. His voice has the virtue of strength and clarity, but not the suppleness and intimacy characteristic of the evangelist role, especially in the higher registers where he can sound strained. Largely for that reason I prefer other versions, especially that of John Eliot Gardiner."
2,OK if you aren't too particular,"Reasonably good ""modern"" performance. Catches some of the festive mood of the work, but lacks the brilliance, power or precision that are an integral part of Bach."
4,"Fun shows, but a 14 episode set is now available at a cheaper price!","These are fun live shows, but a 14 episode set is now available:Legends of Laughter: Abbott & CostelloLegends of Laughter: Abbott & Costello (Colgate Comedy Hour & Radio Shows)"
2,Worked for a little while,I was very pleased with this product about 2months ago. But the the clamp part of the capo won't stay on so it doesn't hold the strings down. When I first got it it worked fine but after I used it for about two weeks it stopped working right.
4,Great!,"Great product! I use it for my ukulele and it works perfectly. Don't have any problems with it, just working on how it works now!"
1,Fast Shipping...But Fake,"Like many others on here I have received my Curve (Green) Bottle and am very disappointed. I bought this from a department store years ago and was very satisfied, so I decided to order this product online through Amazon. The price after all was too good to be true. Since many people buying the 6.8oz from Amazon stated that it is nothing more than a watered down version, I decided to go with the 4.2oz from Amazon but through AAA Perfume LC. The shipment arrived very quickly but the cologne is still fake. When I purchased Curve from a department store the scent lasted for hours, however, this product lasts 15 minutes if that. Very disappointed and I would recommend people skip this or buy it from a department store where you know you are getting an authentic product."
1,Really not good,"I bought this about two years ago when it was on lighting deals. I really don't like it. My wife doesn't like it too. the bottle is still full. I don't know who will like it. it is strong and smell not good.well, this is my opinion, it is the worst cologne I ever bought."
4,Good,The book was received promptly but was unexpectedly tattered. I did not bother contacting the seller since the book was needed for school.
4,Weird - Maybe that's why I like it,"If Book 8 set a new standard for creepy atmosphere in a GYG book, this one sets a standard for weirdest one. One plotline focuses on robots and a remote that controls machines. The other plot, which feels slightly Medieval in tone, is where you fall into a mirror-world where everything is backwards. You find a castle full of glass and mirrors, encounter a beast in the woods, polish a roomful of statues and there's a monster Queen. I don't know, it's crazy and feels like an acid trip in book format. Maybe that's an exaggeration. On a side note, I read this book during a hurricane while our house was in danger of flooding. That's probably why it stuck in my mind so much."
1,UNDESIRABLE READ,"This was a really horrible book. I only gave it 1 star because a rating was required. For me, reading is a pleasure and a real form of entertainment, and there was no absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to be had from this book. I skipped over large chunks of the sleazier content, and finished the book in the hope that I would find something to redeem it, but no such luck. I can't imagine where the author got her 'inspiration' from, or why she thought that anybody would derive anything of worth from the reading experience. Awful, awful book, that I personally would have been deeply ashamed to put my name to."
5,I've always liked the scent of Irish Spring ...,"I've always liked the scent of Irish Spring very much. The soap lathered very well, in comparison to the liquid soaps I've been using. It worked much better for shaving than the liquid soap -- the lather was very thick and smooth. Also, I felt nice and clean after using it. It's too early to tell, but so far it even seems that the bar soap will last longer, and be cheaper to use, than the liquid soaps."
3,Irish Spring Deodorant Bath Bar is a fresh-smelling ...,"Irish Spring Deodorant Bath Bar is a fresh-smelling soap that leaves you feeling rather clean and refreshed. However, I didn't particularly like this scent. I think that this is a more manly soap and I would recommend it to any man looking for a great soap! The only reason I wouldn't use it would be because I didn't like the scent. I would recommend this soap only to men!!"
2,Strong Scent!,I tried this Irish Spring bar soap and personally I thought the scent was too strong and I agree with the reviewer that this is probably better for a man to use. Personally as a girl I prefer my soap to have a more feminine scent like some of the flower or fruity scents. I would recommend this soap for men but not for women who prefer a more dainty feminine scented soap and I think the only reason I even used this soap was because I ran out of my soap and the only thing available in the bathroom cabinet was a package of this soap.
2,Irish Spring not original formula,"It's a pleasant fragrance but it's not close to the original.Recently, my wife bought me a pair of Irish Spring Body Wash liquid containers. My love affair for Irish Spring was born again. It left me fresh for many hours with that rich fragrance. Those are virtually gone except for a small dispenser I tote with me when on a road trip. It was time to get more.This time, however, I opted for that pack of 3 bars of Original Irish Spring. Yes, I'm being frugal as much of that precious liquid escaped to the shower floor.However, the fragrance of the bar soap is not the Irish Spring Original. Not even close. Yes, it's the same striations of various green hues. And it's a pleasant fragrance which I really don't know how to describe.My suspicion? Colgate-Palmolive got their perfume batch from one of their other products mixed in with the Irish Spring."
5,Refreshing Deodorant Soap,This soap is so refreshing. The scent is clean and fresh. This is not a bar of soap which melts away in several days.
3,I enjoyed the soap. Unfortunately where I live ...,I enjoyed the soap. Unfortunately where I live at this time of year your skin gets very dry. I found that this soap made my skin dry.
1,Warning: This is NOT the original version,"Don't buy this book expecting a reprinting of the original 1982 Choose Your Own Adventure book. The text has been revised, though the revision is serviceable enough; but what's worse is that all of the illustrations have been replaced with hideously bad cartoons. Words cannot even express how amateurish and badly drawn these cartoons are, and they're on nearly every page, so it's impossible to ignore them. Buy a used copy of the original book, or choose something else to read."
4,great use of technology,"My 3rd grader enjoys these books occasionally, they're a little young for him (he prefers longer more complex stories like the Eragon trilogy), but he likes them when he's relaxing sometimes. I really just wanted to put out there that reading the kindle version of this book on an iPod touch or iPhone is fabulous, because of the touch-screen capability and hypertext links to the chosen section at each point where you make a decision.I'd also like to point out to the powers that be that the sample is stupid and idiotic. If the sample is ONLY going to include the title page and the ""about the author"" page, don't even have a sample, because it is just an annoying waste of time!"
4,"Great ""endless"" book",My 7 yr old son loves this book. We takes turns reading it and he gets excited/scared to see where his decision has taken him. Great for the imagination!
2,Not as exciting as I remembered,"I remember reading a few Choose Your Own Adventure books when I was younger and enjoying them. However, this book did not live up to my expectations. After getting to one ridiculous ending, I went back to read a different choice and the new choice was a completely different story, but equally as ridiculous. I'm glad it was free. Definitely made for 7-12 year olds."
1,Disjointed,"The plot was so disjointed, I wouldn't even call it a story. Everything happens for no reason and at random."
2,Didn't fit well,"I bought the size indicated by the sizing guide but still had the ""control top"" rolling up like a window blind the whole time I was wearing them. I won't buy this brand again."
3,A disappointing film with great music.,"The story is very trite. It just seemed to move very slowly plot-wise in the first 45 min. John Leguizamo appears to be lip-synching in about half the songs he is singing. I noted that Elizabeth Pena also appeared to be lip-synching in one song. John is about 35, but managed to pull off looking 20 pretty well. The music was great, and should please Latino audiences and others of us who love Latin music and are not Latino. Watch this film for the music and you will not be disappointed."
2,Reebok Tee shirts,Didn't like the feel of these shirts at all. The fabris is stiff and not breathable. This also makes the shirt look boxy.
4,More than Point-&-Shoot,"If you want zoom power, this is one of your choice. It has 10x optical zoom. You can do much more than a regular 3x ""palm"" size point and shoot. Although the size is a little bigger, it is worth it. You can even use it as a video camcorder with its zoom power. Quality is super, it has sound too. Not bad. Color is pretty accurate. Long power life, quick flash recharge. You can take multiple shoot with one button. Very easy to use.There are few things I don't like. There is no time stamp function. It may not bother you, but I like that feature. It may be there, but I can't find it. There is no viewfinder. You probably don't need it coz its 2.5 in LCD is big enough for you to see what you need. Lens cap is not auto. It is not big deal here as the lens are big for the zoom power.I just took it to a 8 days cruise and I had 3 GB of pictures and videos! Yes, this Panasonic do all jobs."
1,My TZ1 also failed outside of warenty,"Great zoom. Great battery life, but can be tricky to get a good picture. Not really point and shoot. Weak low light performance.But the real killer is that it just stopped working 5 months after purchase.Make sure you buy this a long extended warranty for this item."
5,Panasonic lumix rocks,"I owned two Panasomic Lumix cameras: FZ1 and TZ1. Besides them, I also have extensive experiences using Canon , Nikon models that were highly rated. The major usage of my camera are for shooting macro images, and nothing beats Lumix in that. The images yielded by Lumic are so precise, cripsy, natural. Once you own a Panasonic Lumix, it is difficult to go with other models. The combination of the LEICA lens, the high resolution LCD, and the magical autonomic shooting mode makes Lumix unbeatable!"
5,The Best of the Best,"I've had 3 cameras in the last year and this, by far, is the best. It's easy to use, takes good pictures, and yet, if you want to get more complicated, you can do your own settings. And, the optical lens is wonderful. This is a keeper."
5,Great camera,"This is one of the very few compact cameras with a X10 zoom. The advantage of having the zoom overcomes the disadvantages: no optical viewfinder and no integral lense cover, video compression (MOV) allows for a short time of recording. For an amateur like myself the TZ1 is THE camera."
5,A great little camera with amazing zoom and image stab.,"My shopping criteria included a wide zoom range and image stabilization in addition to good image quality. This camera does a good job at all of these. One thing that is a little different with this camera is that you use a half press on the shutter button to engage autofocus. If you just snap away without doing that you might get some out of focus pictures. I happily accept that since the 10x zoom gives you incredible flexibility composing shots. The image stabilization also seems to be very good, which is pretty much a requirement for hand held photography with a zoom range like this. I purchased this with a Panasonic branded SD card and the combination works great."
1,terrible camera,"i have owned this camera for over a year, and overall have had a negative experience. daytime photos usually come out ok, but any low light situations are so noisy that they are unusable. even cloudy days make for terrible pictures. they were so bad i thought surely the camera was broken, so i sent it in for repairs. panasonic was good about a timely response, but nothing had changed when it was supposedly ""fixed.""the main reason i gave 1 star is because there's no point in having a $250 camera that's only good for some situations. the optical zoom is a nice feature, but no built in lens cap and the hefty weight just for some fuzzy pictures is definitely not worth it."
4,Panasonic Lumix DMC-TMZ1S,"I love this digital camera! I have shakey hands, so the anti-shake come in handy all the time. This is a very responsive camera to both the picture taker, and the environment. Very good design just the right weight and size. The zoom is wonderful and works very well with the anit-shake technology as well."
5,Excellent Camera for Great Price!,This camera has some great features. The 10X optical zoom won me over. I planned on taking macro shots without spending a lot of money. The macro mode on this camera is great. I can get within about 2cm of an object in the macro mode and take a crisp shot. Zooming in on already taken pictures is excellent. The few cons about the camera is that there is no way to manually zoom and the camera has some minimal problems focusing in dim light. I love this camera and have been through many other digital cameras until I found this one. I was even able to view the pictures on a huge plasma TV and the pictures were still clear. This was a big suprise since the photos were coming from a 5 megapixel camera. Great quality.
5,Buy this camera!,"I have waited for a camera like this for years. When I saw the specs, I didnt have to think twice. Pocket friendly with 10x optical zoom and affordable at that. Check out other cameras with 10x, either they are uber costly or they are humungous. I am not a big fan of panasonic camera technology but I would have been a fool to not experiment. After using it, I fell in love. The camera looks and feels solid with crisp pictures and effective image stabilization. The bads are no viewfinder and a somewhat disobedient single-shot setting (it takes 3 rapid shots when not in simple mode). You can throw these negatives away considering the overwhelming positives. If you are not a pro, this is the camera for you."
4,Panasonic TZ1,"It's a fun camera. I don't know another 10X zoom you can put in your pocket, at least with loose pants. The lens design does not force it to protrude, which is surprising. It has Panasonic's well-designed menu functions and is very easy and intuitive to use. Rather than allowing aperture or shutter control it offers many ""custom"" settings, like ""baby"", or ""fireworks,"" which I don't much enjoy. And the zoom at longer lengths isn't really very sharp. I confess I gave it to my son after a few weeks because it's a little too much a snapshot camera for my taste, but it's a fun and useful camera notwithstanding. It does come with Panasonic's chronic noise issues when you want to bump the iso, but with this camera you shouldn't be worrying about that. I'd really only recommend it to those who like to shoot on auto or with the custom settings. If you want to think or tinker, you'll be frustrated."
4,Love the zoom and battery life!!,"Haven't got to use this camera too much yet, but, so far I love the battery life and the zoom is incredible. I did my research and thought I'd give this one a shot...I need to spend some more time familiarizing myself with the different features and settings, but am very satisfied. The picture thru the window setting is amasing!"
4,Takes great pics in Iraq,"Simple to use and takes excellent pics from a great distance. If you take video, it uses QuickTime to view it not Windows Media Player. I use the Extreme III SD card and it takes a burst of 3 pics a second. Video quality is great, audio decent and you can zoom in/out while taking video. Great pics while in a moving vehicle except for over bumps but I dont know of any cammera that does. I'm happy with it and cant wait to take it on a helicopter ride."
2,Disappointing,"We were drawn to this camera due to the 10X zoom and many favorable reviews. Unfortunately, the photo quality using the zoom is very poor (extreme blurriness), making it virtually unusable for that purpose. No doubt our results would be better using a tripod, but if I wanted to carry around a lot of equipment I'd buy an SLR instead of a compact. Since the 10X zoom is of no use, I would have been better off buying a better camera with less zoom but that is smaller and that has more megapixels for the same price. Regular (non-zoom) photos are OK but lighting, focus, and stability can often be a challenge. Even at regular settings, I've never had a camera that produces so many blurry photos. While the camera sometimes performs well, occasionally it inexplicably refuses to focus and the flash seems erratic. After a couple of years of frustration and very inconsistent results, I am shopping for another camera."
2,Wish I'd bought a Canon,"After 10 months I've decided to sell my Panasonic DMC-TZ1. There are too many things I don't like about this camera--the noisy (grainy) photos, the slow USB 1.0 interface, and the fact that I can't hold onto the camera without my thumb changing settings. I had no problem dealing with the lens cap, and the larger size and weight were tolerable. I'm just not happy with the quality of the photos, and I'm going back to my old flame Canon."
4,Sweet camera,Very appealling. Could be lighter. Some manual options would be nice too. In general is a great point-and-shoot with outstanding zoom.
3,did a lot of research before i got this,"we did a lot of research on cameras before we got this, it's a good camera and packed with features. Some of the better features are within movie recording, you can zoom in and out while taking a movie, you can so longer movies (if you stick a 2gb sd card in it) and the movies have sound (you'd be suprised how many other cameras don't let you focus in and out and have sound). I'm giving this a 3 star though because the picture quality is not as good as our older camera, we went to vegas with it and snapped up pics with our old canon and with this new camera and the canon ended up coming out with clearer pictures, don't get me wrong, it takes good pics, just not good action shots, they almost always come out blurry."
3,Heavy and stupid!,"This camera takes ok pictures and has an amazing zoom but thats about it. You can't manually adjust any features like brightness, etc. because they only have scene modes. Also, this camera doesn't fit anywhere and its too heavy to just carry aroun on your wrist. I HATE it and selling it as we speak."
2,"Why make a 5MP, 10x zoom camera that doesn't support 4GB SD card !.....",This camera does not recognize Transcend 4GB SD card. The biggest SD card that you can use with this camera is 2GB also verified by Panasonic customer service. Even my 3.2MP Canon SD110 supports 4GB SD cards.Images are quite noisy even at ISO 100. Optical zooming is slower than Canon S1 and not quiet either. The Leica lens and the 10x optical zoom could have been utilized much better. I will return it.
5,perfect!,"I've had this camera for over a year now & I absolutely love it! It is very easy to use, the 12.5x zoom is unbelievable & the resolution is beautiful. This camera is a bit thicker than most on the market these days, but I believe it gives you more to hold on to so your pictures are taken with a more steady, stable hand.This camera never fails to take an amazing photo."
4,Very good high zoom camera,"This camera did not get 5 stars for three main reasons.1) When using the playback feature to view photos on the camera, it is very slow.2) I would like an optical viewfinder for very bright conditions.3) Considering the quality of the zoom, I would like this camera to offer a little more than 5MP and keep its compact size.Other than that, I am very happy with the quality of pictures. I have photographed the Grand Canyon as well as oridinary family photos and the pictures are excellent."
2,Sync problem between flash and shutter,"I own this camera since september2 2006, works just fine until less than a year after I got it starts to work all wrong when flash is used.At outdoors is exceptional, great pictures when the light is good.Bad really dark and black pictures at indoors when the place has low light. The flash forced on, and still the pictures came dark, because the flash shut way before the lens, a syncronization problem. And it's a pity because I was really pleased with it. But now I'm very dissapointed and I want to buy another camera because I can't trust the DMC-TZ1 anymore at nights or indoor situations, and I don't want to have a camera I can use just in some situations when daylight or good light is on."
2,PANASONIC CAMERAS LAST ABOUT 6 MONTHS,"This is my last purchase of any Panasonic still camera or video camera. I have purchased five of them and none lasted more than 6 months. I was lured by the Panasonic point and shoot digital cameras having such comparatively long optical zoom lenses, but obsolescence is built in, with these cameras built not to last more than 6 months. There is no need to suffer with Panasonic any longer as the other manufacturers have caught up with optical zooms on the digital point and shoot cameras. There are two primary still camera manufactures: Nikon and Canon. This applies to professional SLR's and consumer cameras. If you don't believe me, look at any professional journalist. You will not see a Panasonic or Olympus. Go to any television station. The pro equipment is all Sony."
5,GREAT Camera,"Great camera. This is the best one I have ever purchased. I've had Polaroid, Kodak and now this Panasonic -- but I think is is by far the best quality. If they had a built in sliding lense cover that would be wonderful --- but I can manage with this one."
1,Camera sucks,"Photos are not sharp and the exposure, except for outdoors is sketchy and poor at best."
3,Still unsure,"This camera has some very nice features for the price. I am still unsure about giving it 5 stars. I am a bit ambivilant about the quality of the images when in the telephoto mode. The focus seems to be very soft. I will give it some more testing before I say one way or another if I would recommend it.Respectfully,Dennis W. Holt"
4,Works well and a decent value.,"This camera works extremely well in good light. As other reviewers have said, it is not the best camera for low-light work.I have had some luck indoors with bad light, but it takes tweaking. A steady rest or tripod helps.For vacation or nature photography, it is hard to beat. It's fairly small, but has a tremendous zoom when desired.I am pleased with the lens and CCD."
4,Great camera...but,"The camera is really great. Takes superb pictures,but the absence of an eye level view finder makes taking pictures in bright sunlight nearly impossible. I have resorted to using the wide angle lens and pointing in the general direction and hoping to correct the picture in the computer. The flash is great, the lense wonderful etc."
1,AVOID - Major Problems with this Camera,"I have owned this camera for 13 months and recently it began taking terrible photos when using the flash. I did a search online and found out it is a common problem that usually occurs after several months of use. The flash and the shutter get out of sync.I called Panasonic and they said they knew about the problem, but it was not covered by warranty. They want $180+ for the repair.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! It will work fine at first...and mine still does take awesome day photos....but eventually the flash and shutter will get out of sync and you will be extremely disappointed and unable to use this camera for any indoor photos or other photos that require a flash.If you don't believe me, Google ""Panasonic DMC-TZ1 flash problems"" or ""Panasonic DMC-TZ1 flash sync problems""."
1,Very Disappointed,"The reviews I read on Amazon made the camera sound great, although reviews on other sites complained of poor picture quality. My mistake was believing the Amazon reviews. I wanted to like this camera, it is beautiful, jewel-like, and a pleasure to hold. Operation is a bit difficult due to reflections on the lcd display. But the clincher was the picture quality. More than half of the pictures I take in any situation are out of focus. I majored in photography in college and know how to hold the camera still. The focus is poor even in photos at the wide angle setting, depending on the lighting conditions. Very disappointing! I have a Nikon D70 and Canon S400 so perhaps my standards are high, but this puppy is in a box and on its way back."
3,Better Than Nothing,"These plastic box like cartridges feel flimsy and the closing tabs can break off easy. However, they are the only ones that fit the Penquin filters. You are not required to use these in the filters but I fill these with charcoal or ammonia removing pellets to give the filter system an extra boost. This really helps since I reuse the expensive blue filter pads a few times before throwing them out. Simply use a garden hose to clean the blue filter pads and fill the plastic cartridges with charcoal or ammonia removing pellets."
5,Great Cartridges,"I ordered these to use in my Penguin 200. They fit perfectly. I had a problem with my fish dying and didn't know what was causing it, all my tests checked out. I have two Penguin 200 filters (60 gallon tank) I put Fluval Clearmax and Zeo-Carb in the new cartridges along with the standard filter cartridges and my fish stopped dying. It's been over a month and I haven't lost one.They have small compartments, you can use almost any filter media in these cartridges."
4,BEWARE DOES NOT COME WITH FILTER PUMP!,"This is a great pool, however, this specific one DOES NOT come with a pump or hoses, etc... I was very worried at first that it wouldn't even have the holes in the pool liner to hook one up. But, it does. So, if this is a replacement (as ours was) and you have a filter pump or want to purchase one separately, this will work. Otherwise we are very happy with it. Very easy to set up & filled nicely with little worry."
4,Read the description,"I purchased the Intex 10x30 easy set pool in hopes that it would come with a pump, like all other intex pools do. THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A PUMP! You will have to spend another $30-$50 dollars on a pump, which makes this pool no deal at all! You are better off getting the 12x30 pool for around $80 with a pumpIntex Easy Set 12-Foot by 30-Inch Round Pool Set.With that being said, I have two toddler boys who just like to splash around. This pool satisfies their need to swim and play outside on a hot day. It is easy to set up, but you might want an air compressor to blow up the outside ring because it would take forever otherwise. Like I said before, if you want a pool go with the 12x30 because it comes with a pump. If you don't plan on using a pump this 10x30 is great."
5,Fantastic bang for buck,"I was about to get a ""kiddie"" pool when I realized I could spend about $20 more and get an actual pool that I could also enjoy.Now, I have been using my pool without any treatment. No filter or chemicals. Of course it doesn't last long this way. The slime and algae will start up after a week or so. (I think the sub-zero temperatures of my well water may buy me a couple extra days)I just ordered a filter and salt water system so I don't have to worry about water changes. My brother's been using the salt system all summer and says it works great.One other note: It's a no brainer... but you really need a level area for this. Also, really focus on getting the bottom of the pool wrinkle free before filling. I made the absurd assumption that the pool would magically pull the small wrinkles free as it expanded. Very wrong."
1,Yuck,".This was the worst pool ever. When i bout this i thout it was great, but it's not. Pop the first day i got it."
4,must be placed on a very flat surface,"This is a handy little pool but you have to put it on a flat surface otherwise the water can spill out. When kids are playing, the water sloshes around and if one side is slightly lower, the water can start going over the edge and once it starts it keeps going. The other option is not to fill it as much if it's not on a level surface but then the one side just lays in the water and the pool is not as stable. The air ring at the top is the only thing keeping this upright. My husband ended up emptying it and leveling the ground underneath."
2,"cheap price, cheap quality","I used it for less than a month when, not one or two, but multiple leaks occured. The leaks occured from all around the base of the pool. While it worked, my kids loved it. I just wish it lasted a whole summer."
4,Great hard surface vacuum for the money,"I have only a couple of negatives for this vacuum and they can be easily fixed. One is the on switch, which is so sensitive that it turns itself off frequently. I put a small piece of tape on the switch and it no longer turns itself off; works great. The other negative is that the cord isn't long enough so I added a lightweight ext. cord and it's just fine.This vacuum works really great with hardwood flooring. I have sealed, high gloss wood flooring; one tile bathroom and one vinyl bathroom and the vacuum is wonderful for both. I had previously been sweeping and dust-mopping the wood flooring and with 2 cats; the hair was sweeping across the hardood like tumble-weeds. This vacuum is wonderful for hard surfaces; not great for carpets or rugs but I'm extremely happy with the purchase. It does what I'd hoped for the wood floors!! Would highly recommend."
4,Power switch is annoying...,"This vacuum is easy to use and great for quick pick ups. Very lightweight, easy to assemble, and nice looking as well (the cord length doesn't bother me since I live in cramped quarters). However, I agree that the on/off button is too sensitive. I thought perhaps I had accidently knocked the switch, but the switch is just too sensitive. I'm thinking the vibrations from the vaccum jiggle the switch back to off - the switch moves to the half way point and then the vacuum shuts down. I vacuumed for approx. 10 minutes, and the vacuum shut down at least 8 times.The suction power is fine and it picked up all the hair and dust in the apartment. Just be prepared to tape the on/off switch or find a stopper of some sort so the vacuum will stay on."
3,Sanyo SC-WP100 Bagless Vacuum with Electrostatic Dusting,"Neat little vacuum. Bagless is really nice and it is light weight. Just what I need to replace the old broom. Mechanically, the on off switch broke within a couple of months.... Fixed it with a little epoxy, but it should have been built better. Concept: small, light, bagless is the right idea. Mechanicalscould be better. After we patched it , we still use it as a electronic broom."
5,It's about time!,"Many people do not like the dubbing of this anime, but I have to disagree. Where Amelia finally has a voice actress that doesn't sound too obnoxious, the plot and artistry of this anime have been completely improved since we last saw our favorite characters in the Slayers series. This is worth seeing for any Slayers fan to get off to a great start, and worth seeing for anyone else because it's finally become a MUCH better show to watch."
2,Horrid,"I taught this book for an MBA class and it had zero supplemental items, had to create all my own. The book tries to have the 'casebook feature' of corporate examples (which was good), but then it didn't relate to the theory. Verbose, disjointed, complex, overall a disappointment. I'm in search of another book and thought I would put my 2 cents worth..."
2,Counter-intuitive and unnecessarily verbose,"The authors do cover most of the material. However, the language used is unnecessarily dense."
1,Unreadable,"This book is highly unreadable. Examples are not too bad, but the main text is way over the head of all but the most experienced statisticians or mathematicians."
2,not that good,"this book was used in several universities as a material. however, most professors do not use this book. they just use it as ""hand out"". i do not recommend this."
2,Very basic,"This is a great introductory book, but it's very basic. It also doesn't actually talk about how to cope with the thyroid problem emotionally or physically."
4,"great thrash!!! non-stop, stompin metal!!!","to put it in a nut shell, i gave it 4 cuz this new singer could be better, i prefer the other one from their previous album wich in my opinion is a better album, and thrashier-buy that one first thats a straight 5!!But this cd is good, technically and produced very well, guys can play extremely well, i doubt that thrash is ever mis-represented here...worth the purchase though..i enjoyed it..lyrics are a plus too!!!"
5,"Great heavy, straight-forward metal album","Sure, the name threw me off at first but I absolutely love this band. I have heard a few people say they don't like the vocals, but give it a few listens, they just add to the aggressiveness. This particular album is a great if you're looking for straight forward, heavy, driving metal songs that are all quite catchy. I have found it hard to find consistently good thrash/death albums, like the Haunted's Made Me Do It, or At the Gates Slaughter of the Soul (I know, some might call it blasphemy to compare to that album) but I really think this album is good. There are plenty of bands playing this style, but most of their albums have a big portion of not-so-great moments. This one is solid all the way through."
2,Small book for the money,This book was required by the school but we were very surprised at how small and thin it was when it arrived. The price doesn't seem to match up with the value and generic content.
1,Pretty Awful,"Every chapter is worst than the last in this terribly written book. We can only hope that the new edition will be better, but I seriously doubt it as the author is a hack."
4,The Renewed Mind,A good book. I recommend it for anyone to read. It definitely gives good advice on how to change one's thinking.
2,Why this dimentiion?,"With enthusiastic anticipation I purchased this bar and one of 30"". Would you believe that the towel bar is not 24"" on center? No! The bar itself is 24"", hence I cannot change out my original bar for the new one without having a mounting hole to patch and paint OR i could saw off the rod WHICH FITS OUTSIDE the brackets. I cannot find anyone who is willing to cut the rod to fit. It is too likely that the result would be a botched job.Now, I purchased another Delta towel bar for another bath... One that fits inside the mount. It's sawn edge is hidden. What do I think of Delta? Stupid."
5,Search for a Soul,"Search for a soul is a story about all that is sacred in this world. A metaphor that can be translated in any language, culture and circumstance. The journey and the personal struggles we all live through are engaged in this story. Rosemarie applies intrique through her charactors and through the shadow side of all that is mortal (and immortal) she proves that we all do have the light within us."
4,This was a Great DEAL !!,My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Napa Parts store was gonna charge me $230 for this part. Got this one and it was the exact same thing. Had Midas put them in for me and it is great.
1,Stupid,This book was stupid and slow. I don't believe Leigh Greenwood wrote any of this book. I believe the publishers added his name to increase sales.Buy something else.
3,Things didn't go too smoothly............,First of all the DHL truck dropped the box off in my front yard without letting me know. No doorbell rang. No knock. Then when we went to assemble the goal one of the rods wasn't the right length. Called the 1-800 # for lifetime products @ was told they would send another rod. As of this day we have yet to recieve it.Had the rod cut by a welder so that we could go ahead and get the goal put together since it was already 2 wks. past Christmas. Had problems putting the goal together. Directions aren't as clear as they should be. Finally got the goal put together & so far so good...What an ordeal.......
1,Worst customer service ever!!!,"I suppose the basketball goal itself is fairly decent for the price. I couldn't say for sure because after owning it for a month I have yet to get it up. It came with two different parts missing. The instructions are not very good and parts are not numbered and in some cases not even identified. I initially called customer service and had to go through the instruction book with them to show them the step where the part was supposed to be used. Even after being very specific in my description they still managed to send the wrong part. When I called them back to correct their mistake they were very uncooperative, but the customer service representative did promise she would upgrade my shipping. Unfortunately not only did she not upgrade but the part did not go out for nearly a week. I will never purchase another product from this company. I just hope I can get this thing up sometime soon."
2,Dodge Scale Hemi engine kit,"I bought the Hawk Scale Dodge 426 Hemi engine kit, which arrived promptly with the packaging in perfect condition. I got a big shock, however, when I went to assemble it! The diecast pieces, particularly the crankcase, are so badly warped that the kit cannot be assembled as shown. The ends of the crankcase will not screw to the crankcase itself correctly, so the cylinder heads do not fit, nor does the inlet manifold. Attempting to straighten diecast parts is usually a recipe for disaster, so I have E-mailed Hawk directly on the 14th December to ask for replacements, but to date have had no response. I have read Jason's review, and hope that his his nephew does not have as bad an example as I got, or he will have a lot of trouble with it. Unless my flawed example is just a one-off, I would recommend that customers avoid this kit."
1,Worst heater ever.,"What do I detest the most about these badly desinged heaters? There's the screw on clampy type way it's supposed to be installed on the upper edge of your tank, and depending on how that is designed the heater may or may not grip at all. Then there's the resulting total lack of flexibility as to how high the water level can be in your tank. Better fill it up to the brim, or you won't hit the ""water level"" indicated on the side of the heater. Then there's the big fat bulp design the makes it easy to crash it against the side of your tank accidentally. And, if it does get out of the water for more than a few second while on (I know that's no supposed to happen) it blows up and send shards of glass into the tank. Great product there. Some sort of pre WWII design maybe? Buy anything else...anything."
2,Greatest Laughs: The Best of Dennis Swanberg,Just a hodge-podge of video clips poorly done. I would have liked one event with a collection of his best jokes in one evening instead of edited events.
1,No Liner Notes!,"A previous reviewer heavily praised this 2-volume set, and I do not dispute him with respect to the quality of the performances. However, a fatal flaw is the lack of any liner notes whatever. Had I known that, I would not have bought the CDs. For an English-speaking US citizen, the lack of the German lyrics, along with English translations, makes a collection of lieder almost worthless. Arghh!"
5,score!,"On this album, Daughters become even less accessible :) The vocal stylings of old have been totally overhauled to make way for a far more avant-garde, Antioch Arrow-esque approach, chock full of theatrical enunciation and dramatic proclamations. While Canada Songs was an excellently brief math-grind assault, Hell Songs is a lot more archetypically structured and bizarre, with some of the most unusual songs I've ever heard; mostly composed of shrill staccato bursts and arpeggiated noise riffs, the songs on this album have actually breached the 2 minute mark. I can't really point out any standout tracks; this is one of those albums you should listen to from start to finish to truly appreciate (although the epic 6 minute Cheers Pricks is probably the bands best song to date).Reccomended for you adventurous types :D"
4,Dont pay attention to any other reviews,"This cd is musically great, vocally new and different from anything you would think this cd is. That is why its great, they took a chance and im sick of hearing bad reviews and how no one enjoyed it because it wasnt as the sun sets. Well guess what, this is Daughters. Not As The Sun Sets. They broke up and formed something new and different, and in my opinion something just as good. Buy this cd, listen to the cd and enjoy it. Dont be a idiot and expect music not to change. If you like Canada songs, listen to it. If you like as the sun sets listen to it, but open your doors and blast this cd top volume and just enjoy."
4,A must read for Tudor buffs.,"Mattingly sets forth in very lucid prose the amazing and seldom told story of a woman noble in character as well as birth. Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, is the first wife of England's Henry VIII. Though a foreigner, to the end she is deeply loved by the English people. But that does not save her from Henry's machiavellian machinery when she fails to produce a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty. Although she eventually loses the battle, we see a woman of lion-like courage, refusing to buckle in an age of moral compromise. Her stubborn dedication to both church and country, and her deep love for her husband, make her a spiritual example to Catholics & Protestants alike. One wonders if there is any other figure of her time who comes off half so glowing. In a word, integrity! This is the English Reformation told from Catherine's perspective-- a fascinating tale and well worth the read."
4,Masterful and classic biography of Henry VIII's first queen,"A masterful work that is a classic biography of Henry VIII's first queen, Catherine of Aragon. Mattingly set a high standard with this work, painting a very credible and sympathetic portrait of this obstinate and devout woman who defied a king's will and set the stage for the launching of the Protestant Reformation in England."
3,Poor Quality of Photo Process mars an otherwise great book,"I would have to agree with the positives highlighted by other reviewers, however the process that they used to print the photos left them looking like something from a first generation inkjet printer....very grainy and hard to look at without eyestrain. I was rather surprised at the publishers decision to economize in this way and wondered at first if the book was a pirate production. So sorry!"
5,excellent resource,This well done book serves as an excellent resource for the architecture of our national parks. It is an excellent combination of both nature and structures which complement nature. It will be a favorite of all lovers of the outdoors.
4,Keep your ukulele in your hand.,"This is an entertaining CD. It covers a variety of ukulele playing styles and music styles. It shows all those non-believers that the ukulele is something more than just a toy. It truly is a beautiful instrument and a beautiful sounding instrument. This is demonstrated by the performers on this CD. Most of the performers are virtuosos, but the most famous ukulele player of all time, Tiny Tim, technically wasn't very accomplished. Not to say that I don't like Tiny Tim, but his playing is amateurish next to the other performers here. Anyway, this CD covers a lot of different styles and it quite entertaining."
2,Good intention but execution is lacking,"I really feel that those involved had very good intentions when producing this dvd, however there are some fundamental flaws with this product. Primarily, the delivering of the production quality is quite low in its excessive use of graphics and extremely poor sound editing. If we, as parents, are seeking a calm and centered experience for our children (especially children with special needs) than the poorly mixed audio and the overabundance of animated graphics has to be avoided.Also, the instructor needs to pace her cues and model centeredness if this is to be more effective.The instructors words are sincere and much appreciated and I really wanted this dvd to be a success. I hope they produce a sequel that will address these issues.Peace."
5,bvlfari blv,"I love this product, its a clean smell, I get a lot of compliments when u wear it and the price is great"
2,Strong Smelling Soap!,"I ran out of my soap and I had to use this Irish Spring bar soap which was the only soap available in the bathroom cabinet and to be honest the scent was just too strong and overpowering! It may be a fine soap for guys but personally it's a bit strong for girls, at least it is for me. I would only recommend this soap to people who like their soap to have a strong potent scent!"
5,I was pleased with this product. The soap ...,"I was pleased with this product. The soap produces a rich lather and doesn't leave a filmy, oily feeling on your skin. Although I enjoyed the smell, it could be overpowering to some. I thought the scent enhanced the feeling of being clean and fresh. The contour of the underside of the bar makes it easy to hold, too."
2,People Could Smell You a Mile Away with this Soap!,I tried this soap once and I didn't care for the scent. It was too strong.
4,"I really liked the product, but since I ...","I really liked the product, but since I have allergies the strong smell wasn't pleasant to me. I wouldn't buy it again because of this. I let my mom try it and she loved it and will buy it again."
4,I love the Irish Spring Brand Soap. I ...,"I love the Irish Spring Brand Soap. I remember the familiar green spring scent from when I was a child. Being able to Test Drive the sport scent was a treat. The soap has such a pleasant and delightful smell. It's also anti-bacterial for added protection against bacteria. The soap is smooth as silk going on and washes off like water. It's a little harsh on sensitive skin, but otherwise I really like this soap. It's a brand and scent that everyone in my family can agree on."
4,I liked the Irish Spring deodorant sport bar ...,"I liked the Irish Spring deodorant sport bar very much. It has a light, clean scent that works for men and women. The soap left my skin feeling very clean and fresh with no residue. I would definitely use it again and recommend it highly."
2,"Save your money, you probably already have these games.","All but one of the game broadcasts on this set have already been released on other Red Sox DVD sets. And the one new game, Game 7 from the 1986 ALCS is not even the right choice from that series. Game 5 was the ""must see"" game from that series. Guess we will have to wait for the next repackaged Red Sox set to get that one."
3,Plot within a plot..,"Good acting but confusing until you see the double cross! Some British mushy words, otherwise very suspenseful.Sean Bean is his usual rough character."
4,Cleanskin,Very well done look into a terrorist cell from the terrorist eyes. Eye opening! Absolutely must see for action adventure.
4,Entertaining movie for the cost,Entertaining movie with a robust plot and twists. I hope more movies like this become available at this cost. I usually have to download movies when traveling and tend to watch a few at a time. So this keeps me away from subscription services.
2,Sean Bean,"Good story, gritty low budget production. Sean over powered the production. He is great in this genre but deserves a more Bondesque type of scale for his abilities."
4,Solid action,"I enjoyed this movie. Sean Bean and Ms. Rampling are great. The story is predictable, but well acted and for the rental price it was well worth it."
2,The story line was choppy,They give you a character that you start to like only to show him as an angry inept killer with no real skills but anger and a knack for violence. This could have been a movie with a part 2 and 3 but they killed it quickly. Didn't like it.
2,Tepid Attempt to Replicate U.S. Blockbusters,"Decent film with laughably bad moments where somebody clear said ""make me an American blockbuster"". Gratuitous attempts to tap into a sense of national pride are tempered by timid nods to cultural relativism."
1,Very trashy movie,We only lasted through the first half hour. After fast forwarding through the 2nd or 3rd explicit sex scene. We finally gave up. I wish we could get a refund of our $3.99. Pure trash.
2,do not waste your time,you will wish that it will be over do not waste your time or moneyeven if it will be for free i would skip it
1,Good movie if you suffer from insomnia,This movie is not recommended ; that is unless you need to have some noise on to fall asleep to. In that case it fits the bill
2,Not clean,This is a hard to follow poorly executed movie. The acting in it is wooden and the dialog is terrible. I reached the point where I didn't give a damn who lived or died in it.
4,received dvd quickly,Good movie only froze up in a couple of spots.Like these kinds of movies.I would recommend to any fan of Sean Bean.
4,less about him,worthy of a look though I would have preferred for the main character to be developed more and the terrorist less.
3,Thriller,"Having watched the MI-5 series on PBS, I was not disappointed in this movie or its plot: a more realistic view of the soldiers in MI-5 rather than the 007 character. A little more ""zip"" would have helped."
2,meh... disappointing,"Gave it a shot and although it had some interesting lines form the Antagonists POV, it was pretty dull, poorly executed and confusing - mostly because you couldn't understand what people were saying."
3,It's British.,It's okay for a rental to kill some time but I would have been unhappy if I had bought a ticket at the theater.
3,I like Sean Bean,We all like Sean Bean and know he will be a mega action hero one day. Cleanskin is not that hard to follow by a little boring. Another terrorist and anther spy hit man hot on his trail. I would love to give this a higher rating but just can't do it. If your a fan you might like it and if not you won't care one way or the other.
2,Cleanskin,"Not very good, Sean Bean is looking kinda old in this movie and it spent way too much time focused on the terrorists perspective rather than on the underlying conspiracy plot undermining Sean Bean's character's attempts to thwart the terrorist's plot. Confused? So was I, but I guess that's what you can expect from a director with the background this one has."
5,A DVD for Everyone's Library,This is one of the most touching films I've ever watched. It is also the film that got me to move to DVDs and was the first one I bought. We definitely need more films like this one.
5,Enchanting,"Two years ago, I saw this film on an airplane to the Orient. There, despite the roar of engines, the pain of the foolish, never-fitting earphones, and a tiny screen, I became enchanted with the picture and have been trying to buy it ever since. It is a touching tale of an orphan who is ""acquired"" by a foster father that lives on a river boat and has a special talent. Full of drama, emotion, and especially Chinese cultural insight. Super!"
5,"Beautiful, and extremely emotional moving experience-a RARE treat!","You MUST get this movie!!! Not only superbly acted and incredibly beautiful--this is one of the most moving films I ever seen actually based on fact and how China treated their women, which also included foot binding. It has great, incredible emotional impact, next to ""Twenty-Four Eyes"", it is absolutely guaranteed to make you cry. You cannot possibly not get away from shedding tears if you watch this! YOU MUST GET THIS MOVIE!! It's a total emotional experience and one you will never forget. I wish I could rate this higher than a 5. I cannot tell or describe just how beautiful--and incredibly powerfully moving--this movie is. Words will cheapen the experience of it. YOU MUST GET THIS MOVIE!!! It's awesome!!!! A pure treat!!!"
5,AGELESS,"Of all of the movies that are available today, The King of Masks is one that is ageless. Everyone from 5 years of age to 105 years old will enjoy this story. Though the time line is in the 1930s in China, the story portrays all of life's give and take. The actors and actresses are outstanding. It will remind you to look at your own life and who you really are. You will be challenged to consider your life's influences from others and from you to others. I am an avid reader and I must say this movie is well written and casted. I have to see this movie at least once a month, it is that good!"
3,"Great movie, DVD sound quality poor","Several years ago, I saw this movie in a theater and loved it. So, I bought the DVD as a Christmas gift. The picture was great but the sound quality was not the best."
5,One of the best I've ever seen.,"This story is wonderful and the acting is superb, too. If you never watch another film, please watch this one."
4,"Great Movie, Poor DVD","The story is wonderful as other reviewers attest to. Its a shame that the audio and video quality is subpar by American standards. Much is also lost by cutting the film to fullscreen (4:3 ratio). Older Chinese films don't seem to get the same quality or quantity of releases as the newer ones.Techinical purists may gag, but this may be the only chance to own this great film, even if it is in its lesser glory."
5,wonderful film set in historic China,"This is a wonderful film, set in 1930s Sichuan, about an old man who is the last living practitioner of face-mask changing. He laments that he has no male heir on whom to pass down his art, and decides to visit a blackmarket where children are sold. There he finds a wonderful young boy who is thoughtful, enthusiastic and intelligent. Life seems wonderful and the old man proudly introduces his new grandson to the people he meets, but things don't go as planned and he rejects the child. The consequences of his bigotry reverberate until a dramatic action forces him to rethink his traditional views.DVD treatment is below average. The movie can be heard in Chinese and subtitled in English, French or Spanish. The only extra is a trailer for the film."
3,"Not Jackson's best, perhaps","I enjoyed The Road Through the Wall it for it's compelling writing, just as I always enjoy Jackson's work, but as with about fifty percent of her stories and novels, I reach the end of the story convinced that I missed something that would have made the story much more significant. This book mostly paints a bleak picture of suburbia which was rather difficult for me to follow as it had a multitude of characters with generic names that all seemed similar to me. By the end of the book, I was convinced that the characters were intentionally keeping me in the dark, and that they were switching generic nametags behind my back to make things even more confusing. Read Jackson's horror or anecdotal humor instead."
2,Low cost but also low quality,"I've bought a number of these covers, mainly because of their low cost, but now I'm thinking of trying another product. These covers don't necessarily fit all saddles well, often being too short one direction or the other. They also tear very easily in the area where there is an opening for the stirrups and this has happened to every one I have owned. A plastic garbage bag cut down the middle and laid over the saddle would probably work as well."
5,Best BOok,I had to buy 3 text books for a kinesiology class and this one is my favorite. It covers the hands-on portion of kinesiology and is very easy to interpret.
2,Measurement of Joint Motion: A Guide to Goniometry 3rd Edition,"I was so surprised about the paper quality. It's look like a yellow pages. It is not a tradicional book, it is bookbinding."
4,TROJAN HORSE,WRITTEN AT AN EARLIER PERIOD TROJAN HORSE IS ON OF HAMMOND INNES' BETTER WORKS.HE IS STILL A SUPERLATIVE STORYTELLER.
4,"Bosch, short and sweet","This book lays out lots of the hidden meanings in the painters strange iconography, some of which are personal feelings. Of all the painters to write about, he chose only Bosch. What I particularly appreciate about the book is how all of the sections of the painting in which he discusses and blown up and right there for you to look at as you read (short and sweet) I found a lot of facts that were missed by other authors/critics of this outlandish painter. Well done Peter Beagle!"
5,One of My All Time Favorites,"I saw this movie for the first time about 20 years ago on AMC. I couldn't remember the name of it but the storyline and details remained with me. Luckily, I saw it again on cable and purchased it. Beautifully written and directed. One of the best stories of a woman's undying love. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time."
5,Beautifully romantic,"Fontaine is at her best in this story of everlasting yet unreciprocated love. She is as memorable here as she was in Hitchcock's Rebecca. The whole movie is exquisite: first-rate performances, direction, photography, score. Warning: This video edition has a dreadful introduction by Roddy McDowall. Just fast forward and enjoy the movie."
2,Olive Films strikes again,.Olive Films once again releases an older film worth seeing but at an inflated price and without subtitles or sdh. WHAT A SHAME!!!
1,letter from an unknown woman,"It took me a Google search to know what this story was really about, not to mention it is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Jourdan looked like a badly made up wooden doll. I assume this movie was dubbed and the creators were careful not to show his face in close up, so we would not see his lips move speaking French, coming out in English. This may just be my opinion but that is what it looked like. Gigi remains for me the only memorable movie he did.This purchase was a big waste of money for me."
2,Don't Stretch the Image!,"Unfortunately and like ""The Best Years of Our Lives, this Opuls masterpiece has been reformatted to fit the new wide screen television screens. Hence, the actors are much wider than they should be giving this film--and all others like it--a kind of side show look. A crying shame is what it is."
2,Now Outdated,"Wanted to see this again because of fond memories. While Louis Jordan is always a pleasure to see, the film is outdated and Joan Fontaine's performance is leaden."
2,it chilled me so much i froze,"hello???? i love the idea of chill music but this went below zero...where is the groove? where are the surprizes that get you smiling? where are those new tracks that get you to sit up from your seat and say ""wow""?i have quite a few cd's from this set and this was one of the weakest.i'm trying to forget that i wasted my money on this one."
2,Pretty but too small,"As a spoon rest, this is a 1 star product. It's too small and poorly weighted, so it won't support any kind of spoon you'd be stirring something on the stove with. Really, it's useless as a spoon rest.But, I gave it 2 stars because it's attractive, and someone might like it as a decoration."
1,Inferior Coffee,"Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again."
2,ESE users - keep moving,"Product looked and smelled great - however, it was not clear from the description that this product is for non-ESE pod machines. I like the idea of organic and US source, this just didn't work for me."
5,Vintage classic,This soap will take you back to the Forties or even the Thirties. Classic packaging and the nice old-fashioned scent you may remember.
4,a very entertaining mix of Jimmy & Tommy Dorsey movie songs,"This album features several songs from the movies by both Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey and their respective orchestras. There are lots of good tunes including ""Milkman Keep Those Bottles Quiet"", ""Opus One"", ""Song of India"", and ""Fascinating Rhythm"". It is definately a collection all music fans need to own. The Dorsey brothers were certainly both fabulous, each in their own right. Thank you boys!"
3,way off the mark,"I usually like the arranged/fake marriage storyline in romance novels but both lead characters have to be someone I like. In this book, Fiona was such a spoiled brat witch that she had no redeeming qualities except her looks. I was unable to buy that Clay would fall in love with her so quickly and easily before she started making her transformation into a human being. There is a subplot that flows through all the Lone Star Country Club books about a kidnapping and mob activity that makes this worth reading if you are following the series, otherwise, don't bother."
5,Important Information on Japan,"The author seems very knowlegeabl on Japan, how it got to be an economic superpower and the recent decade of stagnation. Gives you a quick overview of both. It seems sad that such creative people are mired in a horrible slump out of which they can not come out unless they change the way the think. A must book for anyone who wants to know why Japan is in such a sad state."
3,hot girls,"I didnt know what to expect when I ordered this item. basicaly you have a group of very hot asian models posing & dancing for the camera in various swimsuits or other similer attire. There is no sex, or outright nudeity. just hot sexy girls YUM"
3,INTERESTING,THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT IT WAS ENTERTAINING. QUITE INTERESTING AND I WOULD RECOMMEND.
2,Probably the most helpful review...,"This book is written by a woman, for women. Being male and reading this book, i quickly saw how useless this book is for me. I am not being sexist so quit mounting your offense, i am simply stating fact. Her lack of knowledge on the male spectrum of this lack of communication skill is obvious. She knows what it's like for women, but cannot speak for men."
1,Boring,"I got Debra's book on CD. She talks about very basic stuff for a long time in a very boring way. In addition, she is not a good speaker. In fact she sounds like a very poor actress. I don't recommend that CD unless you are looking for a very basic stuff such as how to introduce yourself. If I could return it, I would do it."
3,So so,Lengthy! You will keep seeking where in the book is the author talking that you can learn from and improve yourself. And you will end up keep looking :))
1,No substance,"I really wanted this tape to be effective. It is important for me to improve my conversational skills in my job if I hope to advance. The tape is just hard to listen to. It is like listening to someone just ramble on and on. It is a taped seminar and I can only assume that the author was required to give a 2 hour presentation. The problem is that there is only about 15 minutes worth of material. The author repeats herself constantly, gives 5 or 6 examples of points when 1 is sufficient, and really just beats around the bush instead of getting to the point. She tells many stories about herself, which frankly are not engaging. Really there is nothing of value here."
5,It worked for me,"I felt really silly having to resort to this, but the tips work. Conversations have definitely becoming more interesting, and less stressful, at networking events."
1,hard to listen to,"I had a hard time getting through this one. I found the delivery very irritating and the content very weak. There were a few valid points but all the useful suggestions on the tape could have been done in about 1/10th the time. Alot of repeated information and ""fluff"". Most of the information was superficial, the speaker was not amusing or clever or even insightful, and the overall theme sounded like a seminar for manipulative used car salesmen. If you are interested in this tape I'll gladly give you mine."
1,tedious and obvious,The author/speaker took a lot of time to say a very few useful things. The rest was more like a course in conversational good manners for 10- to 12-year olds. I found Ms. Fine's delivery to be quite irritating and not at all illuminating or inspiring. Thank goodness for Amazon.com's return policy!
4,the exact real-life experience is very helpful,"This is my first audio book and second one on small talk. Though the 'tricks' Ms Fine provided is not uncommon in this field, she presented them with passion, which makes a great difference.What is more, Ms Fine does a great job to illustrate her points with vivid and helpful examples. For example, I believe many of us know that we should ask the so called 'opened ended' questions to keep converstaion going, but exactly what are open ended questions, and how one should ask them? Ms. Fine gives the answer, with vivid, to-the-point examples.Personally, I learn a lot from this audio tape, because of the use of examples, instead of just theory and high level statements."
1,Not worth your time or money,"I am a sales professional and am constantly looking for books to help better myself. This was definitely not one of them... This book was simplistic and lacked advise that would apply in the real world. The overview suggests that this book will help you with networking and business relations but very little of it applies. If someone approached you at a business function and asked you ""What was the best job you ever had? What was the worst?"", what would you think? How about ""What would you like to come back as in your next life?""? These are just a few of the lame suggestions this author suggests to ""break the ice"" and begin a conversation. I wish I could return this book..."
3,BEGINNINER GUIDE...PERIOD,"Ms. Fine's tape provides basic guidelines on how to start and maintain a conversation. However, Ms. Fine is providing hints on small talk, not integral calculus. While the tape is relatively easy to follow, the subject matter is not particularly high level, in spite of the difficulty casual conversations often present to many intelligent people.Keep in mind that while the tape does provide helpful advice it is not a silver bullet for shy or uninterested people. For the shy, you still have to approach people and take the risk that, inspite of Ms. Fine's avice, you may be rejected. For the uninterested, you will need a class on acting- being able to engage another in conversation requires you to be truly interested in what one has to say. Only the most shallow will not be able to see through the manipulative veneer of those simply going through the motions of asking open ended questions."
3,Simply States the Obvious,"This book offers solid advice for communicating in general, not just when making small talk. But most of it is restating common sense basics for conversations, like smiling, shaking hands and making eye contact. She touches on asking open-ended questions to invite more conversation (as opposed to questions that can be answered in single word responses). She talks about they types of people who can be conversation killers and how to handle them in a polite manner so that the conversation doesn't come to a grinding halt. And she addresses those awkward pregnant pauses in conversation. The final topic of interest to me was how to gracefully exit conversations. My take home message from this book was that the burden of conversation is on me and it is my responsibility to actively listen, remember people's names, and come prepared with questions appropriate to the event."
2,Boring. Not helpful at all,"The ""icebreakers"" proposed by the author, supposedly to be the jewel of this book, involve so many personal questions. I am afraid that that will do more harm than good to people whose targets are conservatives. Furthermore, the author had wasted too much time to elaborate the importance of small talk. I think the potential readers know that well or they wont pick this book up at all. Even worse, the writing is real boring. In short, not recommended. For those who want to read something to reduce their fear in public gatherings or to improve their social skills, ""How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing With People by Les Giblin"", ""How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie"", ""How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships by Leil Lowndes"" are much better alternatives."
3,She is a talker not a writer,"The book has very good tips, but is repetitive. You can see that the author is more a talker that a writer. Probably she can get help in the next editions from professional writers."
1,More harm than good,"This book starts off by letting you know that by being shy you are being perceived by many as being arrogant, haughty or pretentous. Great, so it's worse than I thought. What follows are alot of open-ended questions that I can never see myself using and some very general advice about body language, social personality types and so on. There's not much substance at all that I found to be useful."
3,Good but not the best,it is good book. Nothing special. From rank of 5 I would put 3. A little bit boring and very ordinary. Won't worse reading if you are working with sharp partners and need to be different and better than ordinary joe.
1,Not much there,A slim book with a lot of white space. Wish I had read the book over a cappuccino at a local bookstore rather than actually buying it.
1,not helpful at all,"I don't see how this book would help anyone. The 50 icebreakers were just awful! If a stranger approached me with pretty much any of the 50 suggested icebreakers, I'd refer to my ""how to get out of a conversation"" handbook.....not worth your money."
3,Nice and simple,"Anyways, it give you a few good tips on improving your day to day interrelations habbits."
2,Kind of weird conversation topics,"Offers kind of weird conversation topics/starters - this book isn't for everyone, I'm sure there's a better option for people hoping to learn some of these skills."
3,Decent,If you are an intelligent person and a decent conversationalist you may not need this. It covers the basics and a lot of it is common sense. It could have easily delved into a much more advanced and detailed system and structure but it's really just a basic frame for conversation. I was done with it in about an hour - its not that extensive but its a good basic program.
5,THRILLING,"This features an extraordinary recording of Turandot...one of the best available.All the interpreters are at their prime.Scotto is a very fragile Liu singing beautifully and emotionally.Corelli is outstanding!! This is surely one of his best recordings.Nillson will always remain the Turandot of reference. She is really a princess of Ice at 1st and then melts in the last scene...amazing!!About the EMI release...I was extremely disappointed. Be sure to own your libretto before buying this CD otherwise you will only get an italian libretto with no translations. However, each act is divided into so many tracks so that you can choose any part of the recording...for everybody's conveniance.Overall...despite libretto problems...This recording Is A MUST...and not only to Nillson and Corelli's fans."
5,Indespensible,"I am a great admirer of ""Turandot"" and own many recordings of it. This, however, is the one I return to most. Corelli is breathtaking. Nilsson--is her divine self. Don't miss this one."
4,This is a great body wash. It left ...,This is a great body wash. It left my skin feeling clean and soft. It lathered up very well with a pouf and smelled wonderful! The price isn't too high; you get a lot for your money. I would definitely tell my friends and family about it!
5,Approaching the climax of the series...,"This is one of the most important, plotwise, tapes in the Slayers Next series. For those not impressed with the ""plot"" of the first four tapes-- never fear! They saved the huge plot twist for the end, and it's defintely worth it. The motivations of Gaav, the Demon Dragon King, are finally revealed, and a major-minor character, the incredibly cool Milgazia the Golden Dragon, helps the group along the way in this tape. For all of you wanting action, there's a pretty good fight at the end with a certain sword-slinging trenchcoat-wearing Chaos Dragon-- and, surprise, surprise, Xellos actually participates in the battle this time! What do you know... also, a solitairy crucial character is introduced in this tape, whether you realize it at first or not..."
2,Blahhhh...,"I can only say blahh for this book. I was on chapter 6 and was so not inot this book but i had to find out who was the candy person gone bad... and so I skipped to chapter 22 and read till the end. The end was the fun part of the book but thats not what makes a good book. Hope this author can do better.. she might wanna stick to her magazine, before runing to the bank on being a book author."
5,Excellent Book!,"I really loved this book. I will be honest, this is my first mystery book to read...EVER! And I couldn't have read a better first book then this one! I'm now an avid fan of both mystery books and Kate White! If you're not sure about buying this book, don't bother being worried about it, just buy it; you'll love it!"
2,Nancy Drew? Maybe because of the 3rd grade reading level?,"I was intrigued by the hype--Bridget Jones/Sex and the City/Nancy Drew and figured this would be a good summer read. I assumed the heroine would be smart, tough and funny (a la Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum but without the unfortunate fashion sense). Sadly, the plot was predictabe and simplistic; White tries to throw in twists to keep the reader guessing, but the whiny characters that never get past two-dimensions leave the reader not really caring who did it or why and just wishing they could off the rest of the cast. Bailey has more panic attacks than your average Paxil user and never rises to the occasion of spunk and toughness that great female detectives reach. Boring boring boring."
1,I can't believe this was a book club choice at all.,This reminded me of mystery novels I read as a kid. It took me 3 weeks to finish because it just didn't hold my interest. It seemed so standard and ho hum for adults. I wanted to get away from the serious and depressing books from other book clubs and just enjoy a good mystery. This just didn't do it.
2,This Book Was Silly,"Ok...I picked up this book because of Kelly Ripa's recommendation and I don't think I'll ever read another of her book selections again. This book was easy to read, but it was quite boring and therefore, pretty far from entertaining. First of all, it seems like half the book is spent describing what the main character, Bailey, is eating, where in New York City she is going, and how she is getting there. WHO CARES??! Then, I found one motive for the murder/murders to be sooo completely absurd that it was laughable...""there's a big plot to kill all the editors of women's magazines."" Oohhh, what an idea. I'm sorry, but once again I have to say, ""WHO CARES??!"" I am honestly and completely surprised by reviewers who are giving this book great reviews. It makes me wonder what their intellingence levels are. Do they like to watch Ricki Lake and wrestling?? Well, needless to say, I would never read another book by Kate White again and I'm sad that I actually spent money on this one."
3,More Sex and The City than a Mystery,"If Looks Could Kill is an ok effort, but falls kind of flat on it&#65533;s face in the mystery department. Bailey Weggins is an appealing character, but the story itself does not hold up for her to shine. The book&#65533;s main problem is the fact that it&#65533;s not really centered on the mystery at hand but more on the nuances of the publishing world of magazines. Not to say that the magazine business is not an interesting topic but when it almost over shadows the story at hand, then there&#65533;s a problem.It&#65533;s an ok effort but it should have been better. I will though pick up the next book in the series to see if the Character of Bailey Weggins get a better story to shine in."
1,Very disappointing read,"If you want a funny book that deals with magazine publishing, check out Marian Keyes ""Sushi for Beginners"". It's not out in the US yet but can be ordered through Amazon.uk.It's a much funnier book with heroines who actually qualify as ""gutsy"". I thought ""If looks could kill"" was very [bad] and the main characters were a pretty unappealing lot. Must the women in this books be obsessed with men that treat them like they're disposable? Do most of the men have to come across as jerks?The mystery itself was not terribly clever, the characters were cardboard and there wasn't enough magazine publishing details to really make it fun. Personally I would have much preferred a version where the detective was the deposed editor in chief (i.e. the Helen Gurley Brown character. At least it would have been a little more imaginative."
4,If looks could kill,I found that this story was a good read. Story line was believable. (Hate those that are unbelievable and rediculas). Informative as well as entertaining. Never lets out of the bag who done it until the very end. Nice twists to the story.
5,More than Cosmo's editor!!,"I found this quick-read to be very intriguing. It's the kind of book that gives you the heebie-jeebies enough to look up from the book and all around you to make sure you're not the next victim. I literally couldn't put it down. I thought I knew 'whodunit' several times throughout the book, but was surprised in the last 15 pages to find it was none of my suspects. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes a good murder-mystery or a quick read."
2,Disappointed,"Slow, boring and predictable pretty much sums this book up in my opinion. I found it to be a chore to finish this book and was completely disappointed. I would never recommend this book to my friends and family."
3,Mystery with insider gossip,"This was the first book in the Kelly Ripa Summer Book Club series. Kate White is the editor at Cosmopolitan Magazine. The book was okay, it sort of dragged, but the insider information on the magazine world was priceless."
1,Poorly written and constructed,"I had high hopes for this book as ""light summer reading"". I was highly disappointed. Kate White appears much more interested in deconstructing what everyone was eating through this book than developing a real mystery. This is a poor first attempt at a novel. Kate, keep your day job, and don't be like Cat."
4,Lots of Fun,"If Looks Could Kill is a lot of fun--a sort of hybrid murder mystery-romantic comedy (with more of an emphasis on the comedy than on the romance). It is quite possible that a true mystery purist may take issue with the novel--so if that's you, consider yourself warned. This novel is all about having fun and being amusing. Cat Jones nanny is found dead one morning by our narrator Bailey Weggins, a newly divorced New Yorker. Both Cat and Bailey inhabit the glamorous New York fashion magazine world. Cat is the editor-in-chief of a Cosmo-like publication and Bailey freelances there. The mystery has several twists and turns and it is all told with much humor. It is an engaging story and a very quick read. Very enjoyable, if not very deep. A novel to have fun with and not take too seriously. Enjoy."
3,Fun read,"I thought this book was fun and kept my interest, which is sometimes hard to do. The only thing that stuck out in my mind throughout was how in the world did Bailey pack so many things into each day? One minute she's working out, then the next, she's already showered, dressed, and out the door. Come on! Please give us a realistic time frame! All that can't be done in less than an hour. And each day was like this. The girl never had time to sleep...and she was ALWAYS eating! ....Despite all that, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're looking for something easy and intriguing to read."
3,A Nice First Novel...,I thought this novel was a nice first for Ms. White. I would have rated the book 31/2 stars if they had one because I felt the story was a little better than 3 stars but that wasn't an option and I don't think this book deserved a 4 star review so I had to settle for 3 stars. The story was okay enough but didn't quit satisfy me as far as plot development and characters go. The writer is a good writer and I would definately read another book by her.
2,"At least an ""okay"" movie only takes two hours to finish.","Hmm... finding myself recently unemployed, I saw Kate White's appearance on ""The Other Half"" and, being obsessed with the magazine world, I thought this might be fun to read. And you know what? It was fun to read. It was fun to read the writing itself. But as a book, it just wasn't very good. The only time I got excited was when I thought that maybe the whole ""A Bailey Weggins Mystery"" was a brilliant device to keep us from suspecting that Bailey would get killed in the end. But that didn't happen. Instead we find out who the killer is and our reaction is, ""oh, that makes sense."""
4,Good Summer Read!,"If Looks Could Kill is a good summer read - moves quickly with interesting characters and some laughs, but does tend to drag a bit."
4,Great Mystery Read!,"I do not usually read mysteries, and I loved this one! It was a great story, Kate White kept me guessing right until the end who the murderer was. I am looking forward to reading more of these books."
3,Light Summer Read,"I read this book while on a stalled Amtrak so it did help pass the time in a pleasant way, but this could not be considered a riveting mystery novel. The heroine, Bailey Weggins, is a freelance crime writer for a women's magazine who tries to solve a murder. There are several conceivable villains and the ending is satisfying. The women in this book, including Bailey, seem defined by whether they have a man attached to them, what they wear, how fat or thin they are, and where they work. Bailey is in constant need of a caffeine fix. To say they are self absorbed is an understatement. There is never any reflection or sense of empathy for others. For a light summer read, this is fine. It is inexpensive to buy--but checking it out of the library might be an even better idea."
2,"If You Must, Get if from the Library","If this is an example of a book from Kelly Ripka's list, I'm glad I've never thought to check it out. If Looks Could Kill started out okay, but by about Chapter 8 I had to start skimming to get to the end. The main character just couldn't carry the book and I hated having to read through every single thought process. Then there was the part with Bailey and her current boyfriend who she finds is cheating on her towards the end -- this added nothing to the story and seems like it was just thrown in for padding."
1,Blahh.. Dull...,"God, the book starts out good. It gets old and tiresome in the middle with a bunch of stuff you could skip and go to the last chapter and never knew you missed anytrhing. Thats what I did, when I got to page 180 and jumped to chapter 22 and finished it from there. I have to say the last chapter was the best of the whole book... too bad the rest wasn't like it."
3,If Looks Could Kill,I enjoyed the characters and the story line. Will definitely be checking out more of her books. That is all.
5,Awesome!,"This book is a terrific mystery, with a totally captivating heroine. Bailey Weggins is smart, sexy, very funny, and the reader gets to solve the murder along with her!"
2,Not what I expected,"Maybe there's something wrong with me b/c everyone else seemed to love this book but I found it pretty eh. I got through it in 3 days which is average for me but kept reading b/c i kept expecting it to get better. The first person past tense makes it feel like Bailey is retelling her story to you...but in a boring way. I didn't feel the suspense of being there with her, solving the mystery. Also, I couldn't identify with Bailey's character. She lets her boss, her lover and many others walk all over her. And she doesn't develop into her own person through the story...she's still pretty much a doormat at the end.So overall, I got through the book but there was no WOW at the end of it. So it was just eh."
1,"Kate, Don't quit your day job!","This book is downright boring. The writing has no pop. The dialogue is flat. The lead character of Bailey Weggins is totally forgettable. And the mystery is, well, not very mysterious. I have to believe that Kelly Ripa is a friend of Kate White's and that's why she recommended the book. I won't be taking Kelly's suggestions anymore. If you want to read a wonderful female lead, with great writing, read the Janet Evanovich series with Stephanie Plum. Janet can write!! As for Kate, don't quit your day job."
2,Predictable and simple...,"I was interested in something along the lines of Johnathan Kellerman. What I found instead was a simply told and predictable story. It had no twists or turns. It was written on a level that would hold a teenager's interest. That could be due to the fact that the writer is an editor for Cosmo mag (correct me if I am wrong). I like books that are fun to read, but I expected this to be spooky and mysterious. It wasn't. The few attempts at plot changes and twists turn out to be false. Usually when I finish a book, I am almost sad that I am done. I finished this one, put it down, and washed dishes."
4,You should read this book.,This is a really good book. I recomend it for people who like light reading. Its a real page turner. Kept my intrest through the whole book. Kate White also gives it alot of personality. I found it funny and entertaining.
4,Right book at the right time,"I was provided a copy of the book when I became a contractor for the USCG. Having a military background already, I was interested in the military history of the USCG. This book has provided me with a glimpse into the mission of the USCG and its leadership style. There are many heart-warming stories of real life heroes that inspire one to the esprit-de-corp that the military resonates.If your looking for a turnkey book on leadership this is not it, but if you are looking for ways to inspire people, and to refine your own personal style than this book is definitely what you are looking for. It is food for thought.Hope you have found this review helpful.Tom"
4,Great read on leadership,"I bought this book to prep for an OCS interview. It's a quick read with some great stories. Great source for some USCG buzz words. For my purpose, it was well worth the money."
4,Currently Active Duty Coast Guard,"I just got through reading the book and was very pleased. I am sorry that the reviewer preceeding me was so dissapointed but for those who sit behind a key board and are not underway you should expect as much. I have not one negative thing to say about the book, the authors, or my beloved Coast Guard. We stick up for each other so I am going to stick up for ADM. LOY. I have deep respect for any one who dawns the coveted Working Blue. To Coasties everywhere, support this book because as you will read it is supporting you. Semper Paratus!"
1,Recruiting Propoganda,"This book is great Coast Guard Academy recruiting propoganda, nothing more. Not real accurate. If you seek an accurate view of Coast Guard leadership effectiveness, start by asking the people who actually make the agency run - it's Active Duty Enlisted forces. (Concur with ""Ethically Challenged Management"") To find out about how effective a service's leadership is, start at the deck plates. I found the innacuracies of this book extremely annoying. ""Be, Know, Do,"" or The Army Leadership Field Manual would better serve your money & time."
1,Ethically Challenged Management,"The Coast Guard has studied and attempted to teach leadership since the inception of the Revenue Cutter Service in 1790. What is missing in this treatise is the view from those being led. At the deck plate, this theory and feel-good tome does not resonate. Those working in Coast Guard blue respond to leaders of good moral character, who lead and care, and who show fairness and compassion. The past relationship between the Coast Guard and Admiral Loy's progeny lends serious questions about morality and nepotism. That the Admiral's progeny continues to receive preferential employment now from the TSA, leads any thinking person to question the credibility of the author. The Admiral's words ring hollow. Should we ""judge one by his actions, not his words"" or should we, ""do as I say, not as I do?""Save your time, there is not much here."
5,Intrigue at its best!,"This makes the second book in the series that I have read and I think both books were great. I'm glad I read ""Into Danger"" first as the characters from that book were carried over into the next book ""The Hunt"". I feel the main characters in both books were complete and had total closure, The secondary characters were left with questions,but I wonder if this will lead into another book on them or possibly they may be mentioned again in another book Just can't wait to see. So far I'm completely pleased with this author and plan to read the two remaining books in the series."
1,Hunter,"Didn't even finish the book. It was not worth my time. Excitement in a book is good, but this sort is not my kind."
3,Hunter,There were some interesting twists in the plot and with the main characters ...I enjoyed finding out what was going to happen next with the characters and their mission. I would read another Crossfire series!
3,A HARD BOOK TO LIKE,I DO NOT LIKE TO READ ABOUT CHILDREN BEING SO ABUSED. IF I HAD KNOWN THAT THIS WAS ABOUT SUCH A SUBJECT I WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN IT.ITS WELL WRITTEN BUT THE SUBJECT MATTER IS NOT FOR ME.
4,angel,"I thought it was very interesting, how he had too interact, and knowing if he could trust them, it seem like everyone was doubtful of the other, but it made a very interesting story, kept my interest."
4,an impressive showcase,"Correction: the book is not 280 pages but 308 pages, does not have 240 pictures but 288 colour photos on fish and marine life.Very few people have dedicated 18 years of their life to achieve such a remarkable piece of work, in both information and photographs. Constant had published a earlier book with the same title in 1992; this one is a considerable improvement. Sure, you could also get a copy of Jack Grove's ""Fishes of the Galapagos"", over 800 pages and worth a few hundred dollars, with pure rock botom scientific information. Not for the average diver, though."
3,Pretty Basic,The information provided is rather basic and is pretty much common sense. I can't say that I really learned anything new. The video is pretty short as well... only 30 minutes long. I suppose it might benefit someone who doesn't do a lot of reading in regards to child development or someone who doesn't have much expereince with children.
2,This is VERY Basic and is ony focused on Young Chidren >4,"This video is extremely basic and is for parents with very young children. It does not address discipline past the toddler ages, and what it does talk about seems OK but very basic. My husband and I completely agree that the basis of discipline (and limits)needs to be love, but feel that sometimes this video did not show the firmness that good parenting can require. We are blessed with wonderful chidren, 6 and 10, and wanted to grow as better parents but did not find this video very helpful."
3,"Great performances, not many though.","I really enjoyed watching this DVD. The Talking Heads were great. Queen rocks. The Go-Go's look so young. Rick James jams. Duran Duran sounded great. Heck, all the performances are great. The problem is that I was hoping for a disc full of songs. DVD's these days hold a lot of information and SNL as usual lacks taking up any of that space. At least they don't edit the songs like they do the acts on the best of DVD's. There was just so much more from that era they could have added. Maybe one day the true vault will open up."
5,Operation Puma,"This book expresses an extra ordinary ordeal ""the tragic story of a gallant failure"" Admiral Arleight Burke"
2,"Sexual braggadocio from a smart, conceited Italian","Alberto Bevilacqua is an accomplished novelist and, I now know, quite the man about town. This book is all about the women he's known, about how exquisitely sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's full of bragging and posturing. He is pretty good at describing sexual acts, bodies, and female orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten -- he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended. (What if she was faking?) I liked his memories of his very young adolescence. This book was adored in Italy but I would guess that they saw right through it in France."

5,Snuff Rule,"With reference to earlier reviews of this CD - maybe America just doesn't get Snuff! I've followed every step these lads have taken since the late 1980's, and ""NUMB NUTS"" is one of their finest.""EFL VS CONCRETE"" is one of the most poignant love songs you're ever likely to hear, "" MARBLES"" I intend to have played at my funeral, and ""BOTTOM OF THE RIVER"" just rules, dammit! There ain't a wrong note on this whole album, and for anyone new to Snuff, this is a great place to start>"
4,blah blah blah not punk enuff -- bollocks,"The new snuff album is a non essential purchase. It is an album of songs with their trademark sound. This is not a bad thing. ok it is not a very aggressive punk sound, but just relax and the fun side of snuff will win you round. With too many 'punk' bands having the same so-cal punk sound this album stands out. Just buy it. if you like snuff you will like it."
5,STILL ROCKS AFTER ALMOST 20YEARS!,"A solid underground masterpiece of heavy metal and rock. Recently I bought a used copy since its no easy to find in Mexico, because my original cd was stolen years ago. Fortunately I must still say this a solid and original album which reminds me Billy Idol with more power and anger in songs like Ass-Kickin and Punk and Belligerent. Full of an amazing anthems like Love Destruction, Blown, Dimension and the oscure The Fallen.This is a must have album that emerged from the ashes of the transition of the grunge era. I put this band into a selected category of preferred underrated bands that I really enjoy and with unique sound, with different styles like Mind Bomb, Love/Hate or Pist*On."
5,JUST AS POTENT IN 2008 AS IN 1992,"IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS CLASSIC YOU ARE DEFINITELY MISSING OUT. HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS CD CAME OUT IN 1992 BECAUSE IT IS STILL SO FRESH SOUNDING WARRIOR SOUL SHOULD OF BEEN HUGE. THIS CD IS A CLASSIC IN ALL RESPECTS. EVERY TRACK KICKS 'LOVE DESTRUCTION' DEFINITELY ONE TO CRANK UP, SHINE LIKE IT, 'PUNK AND BELLIGERENT' ANOTHER CRANKER, 'GHETTO NATION' ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVES. EVERY TRACK IS SPOT ON WITH SOME EXCELLENT MUSICIANSHIP, JOHN RICCO HAS SOME KILLER RIFFS ALL OVER THIS CD, KORY CLARKE WROTE SOME KILLER LYRICS THAT ARE STILL JUST AS POWERFUL SOME 16 YEARS LATER. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PICK UP THIS CD. YOU WILL DEFINITELY PUT IT IN HEAVY ROTATION (I BOUGHT IT IN '92 AND STILL LISTEN TO IT ALOT) I GUARANTEE IT ~ SALUTATIONS...."
3,Love Destruction!!!,"If you really like this band this cd is a must, but if I wasn't a fan I'd maybe not take another chance on Warrior Soul, though Love Destruction is probobly the best song they ever wrote. Punk & Belligerent is a perfect drinking song."
2,Flawed Scholarship,"Bacchiocchi is a leading apologist for Seventh-day Sabbatarianism. An earlier book - ""From Sabbath to Sunday"" provoked some debate, and has been effectively answered in ""From Sabbath to Lord's Day"" (Carson, ed.) Bacchiocchi however seems unable to get to grips with the the case made by former SDA scholars like Robert Brinsmead, let alone those in the theological and historical mainstream, which long ago demonstrated that Sabbatarianism of either the Saturday or Sunday variety was something of a non-issue in the early church. Bacchiocchi lays praise for the Sabbath on thickly, but stands in danger of missing the point entirely. Just how brittle Bacchiocchi's apolegetic is may be gauged from his championing of schismatic sects having their origin in the now non-Sabbath-keeping Worldwide Church of God."
4,This soap wasn't drying and harsh on my ...,"This soap wasn't drying and harsh on my skin, as some others are. It smelled very fresh and nice. I'd probably recommend it to someone. The only thing I didn't like is that it isn't anti-bacterial."
3,I think this product isn't for people with ...,"I think this product isn't for people with dry skin. I have dry skin and while I was using the soap, my skin became even drier. My husband has oily skin and the soap worked perfectly for him. The bar doesn't """"melt"""" and produces a good foam that smells good. But unfortunately, I'm not going to buy it."
4,We really liked the Pure and Natural soap. ...,"We really liked the Pure and Natural soap. Our family has many problems with allergies, and this soap didn't cause anyone to break out in a rash or aggravate our eczema. It rinsed off well and we like the clean scent."
4,"For years, I bought nothing by Ivory Soap, ...","For years, I bought nothing by Ivory Soap, because of its purity. Though inexpensive, the individual bars did tend to wear down to nothing awful quickly. These days, my fiancee lives with me. She's been buying the soap, and we've been using Irish Spring. I've never felt entirely comfortable with soap that has all those useless (to me) chemical additives. Hey! That green color can't be natural. However, I dislike shopping, and gladly left it to Jessie. Thus, I jumped on the chance to Test Drive Pure and Natural Bar Soap. No driving to the store and waiting in a long line for this. The upshot? Jessie and I will now be using Pure and Natural from drugstore.com -- the perfect answer for us."
1,Old Soap,"Because I liked this soap I ordered 9 bars and received 9 bars of Pure & Natural in various aged packaging. The soap appears to be rather old the packaging somewhat sun-faded and of mixed parentage, different wrappers some from Pure & Natural and others from Dial Soap. I called the telephone number on the soap and was informed by Dial that their Dial Basic was the identical product and the Pure & Natural label had been discontinued. So instead of spending a fortune on soap from here, shipping cost more than my 9 bars, look about in the supermarket for Dial Basic because it's the same thing with different packaging. And will probably be a year or so younger."
2,Destroyed after minutes,"I got these along with some other Chuckits for my dog, when they arrived I allowed her one of each type to play with. These were broken open and the outside material was all over the house within an hour. Granted she still wanted to play with them, but she was trying to eat the fuzz so I just pitched them. I will stick with Chuckits other toys because she still has all of those in one piece."
2,My chihuahuas ripped them to pieces,"These mini balls are not resistent at all, I have two chihuahuas and at first the cover started to fall apart and then my dogs just finished rippin' it off, they ate it and I had to throw both (balls) to trash.Didn't last the month."
2,Little Balls,Expensive little balls. My 7 pound dog destroys these quickly. But they fit the throwing device and I can't find them localaly.
3,Eaten!,"Didn't take my dog long to chew these up, she tore off the fuzzy coating and the balls broke in half.They were fun while they lasted, she's too big now for this small size and I don't want to buy something that won't last 5 minutes.My dog is a Red Heeler. 6mths old now"
1,A Time For Something Else,"Save you money! This isn't really suitable for anyone who cares what their children read. Much, much better can be found elsewhere."
2,"Callas, divine, Di Stefano, stay home","Callas is truely exciting in this set of duets. But she does not have an equal partner in Di Stefano. Frankly, Di Stefano has a tiny, shrill tenor that shouldn't affort him any role larger than that of solo in the church choir. Sorry, I only speak the truth. His voice is the essence of ordinary. That's why no one in my UCLA opera class has heard of him. But everyone is in awe of Corelli and Del Monaco."
1,"You are kidding, aren't you?","To the ""person"", or persons who think Di Stefano is world class. Di Stefano one of the top three tenors of the century. You must be joking. He has no high notes. The voice is flat. There is no ring. There is no squillo. There is no pathos. He can't act. Should I go on? He only is famous because Callas chose him as her choice for tenor. Why, because he can never outsing her. Sorry, but Di Stefano is totally unremarkable, and if you open your ears, try the following: Corelli, Gigli, Pavorotti, Carreras, Domingo, Caruso, Del Monaco, Lanza, Bergonzi, Melchoir, Kraus, Gedda, you get the picture."
1,"terrible, slower than slow, can we drag the dialogue out any longer?","This was a horrendous movie! It was boring. It was slow moving. The characters were despicable. They had close up shots of two different wads of siemen, one of which the dog licked up on camera. Need I say more?"
1,Pointless,"I really liked Welcome to the Dollhouse, so I was expecting much more from this movie. The characters are so pathetic, it is painful to watch. However, there is no real plot to thie movie, beyond ""life sucks."" Imagine if the whole point to the movie was ""life is great"" and showed happy people. It wouldn't be considered a masterpiece, it just would be considred pointless and trite. Also, those conversations between Bill and Billy never would have happened, they were just put in there for shock value.The one thing I liked about the movie was Bill's wife was so condescending towards Joy it kind of makes me glad her husband was so messed up."
2,Where do I go with this movie?,"After watching Happiness, part of me wants to applaud the creators for daring to illustrate unexplored reaches of human lust, self-loathing and lonliness. Another part of me, after watching this movie, wants to condemn the creators for their explicit depiction of these desires, namely, the father who fantasizes and acts upon his desire for tween boys. As the above reviewers have noticed, this movie makes it it's mission to concentrate on negative-""Let's stir up some controversy!""-shock value.If I were making the comparison between the 'behind the scenes suburban lonliness' movies that I have seen; I would certainly say that movies like American beauty or Donnie Darko had more of an effect on me.What I am left with after watching this movie isn't a lesson, or a moral. Just a rotten feeling in my stomach."
3,Are you ready for the uncomfort zone?,"I rented this movie thinking it would be similar to Welcome to the Dollhouse,..was I in for a surprise and major discomfort! I gave it a second chance and it was much more humorous the second time around."
3,Shock value alone does not make for great cinema,"Maybe it's just me, but this film was pretty boring. The fact it's ""shocking and daring"" means bugger all when the film itself isn't all that great. It seems Todd came up with a half arsed film, then just threw the pederast and phone stalker in there to shock people out of realizing it.There were some funny parts, and the ending will surely make just about everybody reach for a vomit bag, but a lot of the parts in the middle were just dead.I'd recommend renting it first, just to see what you make of it. Much like The Bad Lt. it's amazing this film has the cult following it does."
2,Well...,"...a good story, decent acting, some harsh subject matters, but none that I haven't seen before (I'm from Europe, we're more used to be shown the ugly and nasty aspects of life in movies devoid of any glitter), but it nevertheless failed in holding my attention. The two stars goes to the writer/director for daring making a movie like this. Wouldn't recommend it, wouldn't not recommend it."
4,A misunderstood film worth watching,"How can one say this film has no point to make? The separate but inter-related stories of social interaction in today's society. specifically that of the netherworld known as New Jersey, is simultaneously a hilarious mockery and poignant expose of humanity ---- people are lonely, deprived, weak, and most of all, stupid! It is brilliant in its vision alone, if not the actual execution of the vision on film. I laughed my asp off, squirmed, winced, and came away thinking ""Yeah, it's really like that, isn't it."" If you are unable to see past the elements of the messenger (pedophilia, etc.) to get to the message, then please, don't see this movie, and especially do not comment on it! This isn't the type of film to be embraced by the mainstream and win awards, but if you want to be entertained and like satire, go for it."
5,Beautiful Revolution,This movie is total brilliance because it deals with people who are inately self involved and their demented quest for happiness. It has a script that is so sharp and poignant that you will be thinking about it for weeks. It's revolting and beautifully truthful at the same time. See this movie because it will make you realize how crazy this world is.
5,"Amazing performances, incredible script","This movie blew me away. The acting is incredibly good, and the script, twisted and funny, walks the line between fantastical and disturbingly real. One of my favorite movies."
5,Pure Art,"No long winded review here. This movie is pure art and nothing more. Its use of metaphoric, but still accomplishingly literal material really surprised me. Its a cerebral work taht obviously apeals to most audiences. Simply stated, Happiness showed us what cinamatic art can and should be resembling. I am happy to have seen it."
4,Disturbing.,"This movie (by the Director of one of my favorite movies - Wellcome to The Dollhouse) was more of what I expected. In your face emotion, confusion, and awkward feelings. I actually took my girlfriend to see it on a first date, and after she not only liked it, but had a hoot with it, I knew we were to be together for quite some time. Why I bring that up is because Todd Solondz's movies are a definite acquired taste. But after acquired...boy is it a crazy ride."
4,DARK!!!! Not for the squeamish...,"This movie is disgusting and sick but funny at the same time. Not funny, ha ha, but a dark kind of funny that you only get while observing the misfortunes of others. Interesting in a very dark kind of way.P.S. There is a large quantity of human male ""fluids"" shown. A little excessive, but I get it."
3,Happiness does not wear well...,"I first saw this movie several years ago and, I guess, my mood was such that, aside from brilliant acting; I found the film wildly amusing despite its central theme. I ordered copies for several friends who seemed to find it ""strange"" to ""wierd""...not very funny.I remembered it and tried it on a new friend last night. It is still shocking, brilliantly acted...but it isn't very funny after all. The big laughs I remembered just weren't there. The film moved quickly but I kept thinking, ""now comes the REALLY funny part""...and there just isn't one.It is brilliant, disturbing, shocking. It is not a comedy. Those who turn it off after ten minutes may be missing an experience in cinema...but a very ugly one."
5,A sleeper!,"Just happened upon this movie on TV, never having heard of it earlier. It is a classic movie with topics not ordinarily seen in movies, superbly acted. It is a movie about common people with uncommon problems. Often the viewer can laugh and cry simultaneously. Sexuality is discussed openly and yet appropriately. Many moving scenes."
1,Excruciatingly boring,"The people in this movie are creepy, all right, but unfortunately there's little if anything interesting about any of them. This is one of those movies in which you're sure something is going to happen any minute now, but nothing ever does.In reaction to the reviewers who are making a fuss about ""child abuse"" in this movie - well, it's not there. A little suggestion or two, but hardly anything to work up a sweat over.In fact, there's nothing at all in this movie to get worked up over, or even to wake up for. This movie might be good to put on the TV if you have unwelcome houseguests to get rid of; otherwise, NOT recommended."
1,Look elsewhere...,"I can't believe I wasted not only my hard earned money, but my precious time watching this DVD.So many people have referred to it as ""brilliant"", ""funny"", and ""artistic"". It is none of the above. The characters in this movie are sad, boring, lonely, sick, and perverted. I made the mistake of pausing the movie on many occasions just to get a break from it. Unfortunately, that only made the movie seem three times longer than it really was.Please don't make the same mistake I did by buying/watching this mess."
2,Sad state of affairs,I found this an extremely disturbing movie - in the same genre as American Psycho. It has some really disturbed people... and Moliere style - it blends them into a noxious brew. I had to view this for a class - and I've done that... as entertainment or something deep even to watch with a good friend it is a bridge too far. I'd not recommend this.
4,"There are some movies that defy reviews,","There are some movies that defy reviews, and happiness is one of them. A movies that tears through almost every hidden, untalked about dark structure within the human mind... When I first saw it I could barely believe what I saw, I couldn't even catch my breath! See it if you pride yourself on your morality because its always good to be exposed to that darkside of human nature so as not to forget. See it if you have no morality to speak of for a good laugh. See it if your just another poor sucker like me so you can grimace and grip tight your seat at every scene. God help me, i couldn't even catch my breath at some points in this movie. Some people like to mention this movie in the same sentence as ""Very Bad Things"" but this one restructures your mind at the primordial level. or in other words: You'll probably hate it, but watch it anyhow."
5,Brilliant Black Comedy,"This is one of the most interesting and original films I have seen in years. Although it may offend some ""lighter"" viewers, it is certainly worth seeing."
4,Happiness is not a fish that you can catch,"I am reminded of that Our Lady Peace line. The movie revels in the irony of its title. This movie takes several characters, none of them truly happy, and lets them bump into each other. The main focus, though, is on one highly dysfunctional family. Yes, this is one of *those* movies. A taste of life on the wrong side of the tracks. And that is what is so provoking about this movie, the fact that it is real. These could be real people. This movie could be taking place over at the apartment complex down the street, for all you know. That's actually one of the themes of the movie, not paying attention to people (and subsequently not missing them when they die). You will get caught up in the lives of each of the characters, wondering where they'll go next.Be, of course, forewarned: this movie deals with masturbation (complete with semen onscreen), pedophilia (nothing explicit, thankfully), sex, and rape. It's not exactly family fare. But it's a good movie."
4,The strangest movie I've ever actually liked,"I can honestly say that we got this movie because we thought it would be sort of a funny look at Happiness. Strangely, Happiness is the LAST thing this movie is actually about - instead its about a lot of people who think they are happy and then arean't. In a strange and disturbing way, this movie turns out to be a fascinating look at the often unspoke of side in our society - really worth seeing."
3,"If you hate people, this one's for you!","Solondz is certainly talented, but his misanthropy knows no bounds. Pretentious and ugly but never boring or uninteresting, ""Happiness"" has its merits, as well as considerable faults. See for yourself."
1,Filth!,This movie glorified the shock value of sexual peccadillos to its maximum. I actually felt violated watching this movie. Completely unentertaining. Made me feel very uneasy watching it. It seemed to have no point.
2,Not good,"I thought this a slow, poorly written, poorly acted film, that tried to get a rise out of the viewer with shock value, like a comedian who has no talent, so resorts to toilet humor to get an audience response. To those who were offended by the pedophile stuff...I don't know how you could have been, the acting and directing and writing of that whole episode was so amateurish, for it to shock, those involved would have had to have some TALENT!! I saw DOLL HOUSE and liked it okay, but this movie didn't work at all."
1,Sadness,"Happiness is certainly not a movie for everybody. Since I like movies like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", I thought ""Happiness"" dealt with the same explicit matter. I was wrong. Happiness is a immature, disgusting, coward piece of movie. We are introduced to a man that has strong feelings for little boys. There's a guy who makes random explicit phone calls to women while he pleases himself. There's a woman who tries hard to make herself happy. But she always picks the wrong road. I ask myself, is this entertainment? Or is it drama? Should we feel sorry for them? These is the kind of people I dread to meet. You never know who they are until you know them. This movie is complete junk."
1,Very disturbing film,"This is a very disturbing film. I didn't watch the whole thing because I was so disturbed. I even got scared of it towards the middle. It started off kind of funny and I thought it was just a dark comedy. As it went on it was just disturbingly dark, not funny at all. I understand the meaning behind it, which is a good meaning, people are different behind the scenes, everyone wears a mask. That's what this movie is about. Yes it's sick...is that wrong? No, different strokes for different folks. Everybody likes diferrent type of movies, this could be yours, it may not. I just didn't like it."
5,Important moive,"This movie elicits so many emotions from the viewer...laughter, anger, sympathy, disgust, and when its over it stays in your head for days. The casting is excellent, notably Dylan Baker and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The subject matter is intense, and the humor is as black as it gets, but this is an important movie that should be seen by everyone that can look past the shocking surface."
1,Great Movie - Awful DVD,"Nothing more needs to be said about how excellent this film is. HOWEVER, if you get the DVD, it is one of the worst quality transfers ever...there is so much pixelization and artifacting that people's heads actually pulsate and change in some of the close-ups. Unwatchable. TRIMARK should be ashamed to release such a travesty. Are all of their DVD's so cheaply made? Buy the VHS instead."
2,not that amusing,"Although this movie has some amusing, and almost entertaining qualities, I found that is was just not my cup of tea. There was an insane level of gratuitous nastiness that put me off from the start of the movie. I did enjoy that, unlike a lot of Hollywood movies, it did have a plot that was beyond average. The movie was daring enough to go beyond socially acceptable norms, but perhaps it should have done so a little less graphically. I think that when a viewer is faced with blatant dysfunction in every character it is very disturbing, and that definitely happens in this movie. At a certain point in the movie you just want to escape, and find some way to make it all stop...the story, the characters, the craziness. Everything."
2,Such potential...,"After seeing this movie again after 2 years, its weaknesses are even clearer. So many obviously unrealistic lines and a general contempt for just about every character. It's also unsettling to imagine the child actors' perceptions of what they're called to do in this film. Some isolated terrific moments, but, overall, too cartoonish, too self-consciously controversial, and just basically unbelievable."
1,Avoid,"What an awful, awful film. As to the much-vaunted ""taboo"" subject matter, nothing rings true. Its perfectly legitimate to attack difficult subjects, but to simply exploit them in an attempt to add fire to an otherwise flat script and unimaginative direction and production merely bores and offends (the intelligence, not the sensibilities) of the audience. After this and the meandering ""Dollhouse,"" Solondz should hang it up."
3,"A good film, but not an enjoyable movie","The Netflix liner notes say ""not for the squeamish"", and I believe it now. A great cast of character actors but the story lines are harsh reality of deviant behavior."
1,Unhappy with this film.,"More like, disturbed and forever traumatized. Okay, maybe not to that extreme. Maybe I'm just not used to the whole ""pedophile"" concept being portrayed in films but this movie just made my stomach churn. I don't find happiness in watching perverts fulfill their own happiness.My only favorite scene was the first scene of the film with Jon Lovitz ""No you're not!"". Jon Lovitz, great guy. Too bad he only had one scene. I thought I had made the right choice renting this movie, but after that scene, it went all downhill from there. I do understand why it's titled ""Happiness"", but it's just too overwhelming for me. Child molestation is a very serious topic, and I don't find it something to be joked about.Good thing I only rented it (based on the raving reviews on Amazon) and right after watching it, I jogged back to the video store and returned it ASAP! I don't understand how someone can sit through all this!"
5,Solondz is simply outstanding,Solondz has figured out how to make the audience laugh hard and then feel guilty about it later. No other movie has left me in such a confused and affected state. Amazing.
1,NASTINESS,"I am hardly an uptight person, making me all the more surprised that this is a film I could barely handle. This movie sat with me like a bad meal I just want to get out of my system. I normally like unusual and groundbreaking film. And I did like Welcome to the Dollhouse too. But this movie, aside from it being slow... this movie was perversion in the guise of art.Some things are better left unspoken. Unless you need to have your eyes opened that perverseness can be your neighborhood superdad, I'd say the aware people have no use peeking in the window of a pedophile's world."
1,One sick & twisted film.,"This is quite a disturbing and challenging film. It is entertaining in a sick sort of way; but after it was over, I wished I hadn't seen it. The direction and acting were good, but the story was just too disturbing for me. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Most offensive movie. Ever.,"There is nothing funny about molesting children. If you think this movie is ""cute"", ""funny"" or provocative, then you either don't have children...Or shouldn't.This film is hideous, offensive, and insulting to human beings. The director, actors and fans should be ashamed."
4,"relax, calm down, listen, think",I see many negative reviews on this film. Do you people have an imagination? Lighten up. Sure the film may let some in on a little more then they care to know about and yes it may also stomp through the dark territory of the mind so what? Just because you people cant handle it does'nt make it a bad movie all around. To those of you easily turned off or on by other peoples opinions i would simply just advise you to see for yourself. And to those who cant seem to understand that there are disgusting things in life out there and apparently dont wish to deal with these things and write bad reveiws on other peoples works stay inside your cozy homes and stay out of our consciousness. Thank you.
5,'Desde Siempre' is 100% for Latin Lovers(and everyone else),"This generations most consisted and best latin ballad artist. I must admit when he first went solo after Menudo, I didn't want to like his music. Over the years his music is just head and shoulders above all latin ballad singers.For the players and husbands 'in trouble' out there looking for that extra edge...get this cd.All the songs are great but my favorite is: #4'Cuidarte El Alma'You can't go wrong with this cd."
3,Salsakid34 - Correction,"Chayanne was part of ""Los Chicos"" not Menudo. He auditioned for Menudo, but was considered ""too old"" therefore would only be in the group for a short time only. He was not selected. Just wanted to run this by ya..."
1,Sólo un tema nuevo,"Sólo Contra vientos y Mareas es inédita, aunque ya la había escuchado cantada por Franco de Vita en sus grandes éxitos.Hay tres temas del disco Sincero y los demás son algunos de hace 15 años, como Fuiste un trozo de hielo en la escarcha, que es la peor canción y el peor video de Chayanne.Un timo"
1,Otro recopilatorio??No nos tomen el pelo,"No se si es la disquera o que nos quieren tomar el pelo, pero en el 2002 ya hubo un recopilatorio, todas las lentas de este cd las tenemos ya, o estan en el disco Sincero(buenísimo)o son las de siempre.Don't fool us, don't pull my leg, No nos tomen el pelo, por favor, que somos jóvenes pero no tontas"
1,sad,"None of this is true,its a book to scare people from useing drugs.but the book is a good hard cover that is interesting to see how people are liars and untrusting of the facts.What a marijuana madness scam to scare people with lies"
1,What a Icon!!!!!!!! i just adore the way he is so gay,"give me a break this guy isnt any better than Vanilla Ice Eminem is just proving that he is different because he can rap about life issues and not about sex,cars,money mainly everything he writes is depressing which theres nothing wrong about that but songs that promote against your mom is just stupid and songs about screwing anything that walks that is dumb and the i don't give a fu** attitude is really getting oldEminem is just a phase lets see where he will stand in 10 years lets see...............if he is standing then MTV is making more money than i thought"
1,ONE SAD LITTLE BOY.,"This guy reminds me of a whining little baby crying over spilled milk.I dont feel any sympathy for this guy and I wished hed stop with his mommy issues and seek therapy.This white little punk who pretends to be hard thug wouldnt last a day where im from.If hes so tough,then why does he need an army of security?As far as the album,the beats are too repetitive and the lyrics are absolute trash.Hes just another commercial puppet like britney spears who will be unheared of in another 2 years.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
2,uhhh....does this hurt anyone else's ears?,"Allright, see I like eminem, but sometimes I don't like the language. Yeah, go ahead call me whatever you want. But just a warning to you youngun' virgin ears. If you can hardly handle the edited ""Real Slim Shady"" well don't buy it. I have the whole edited CD and sometimes i just hear nothing in the song for a few seconds while they edited out all his perverted comments that made him so ""great"". I'll give it up a little. Some song on here are good, but if your expectin to hear fun, hyper songs Like ""Real Slim Shady"" Maybe you should try something else. This is one of the CD's I'm hoping to sell to somebody."
1,A Poor Piece of Trailor Park Rap,And you thought that Vanilla Ice was a bad rapper just wait till you here the Marshall Mathers LP. .... This guy raps about jibberish. One minute he's talking about his exwife and the next minute he's talkin about NSYNC or NSTYNC as he calls it. Thats the only thing I agree with on this album :) Oh man don't purchase this you are wasting money. ... Remember White Guys can't Rap!
4,give it a listen or five,"it's true that this isn't the Slim Shady EP dark joy-ride. however, it is a good 2nd offering, and it would take a miracle indeed to live up to his debut album. he isn't producing albums with the intent of pleasing his fans, and if you listen to it for the venting and production that it is, i think fans of his previous album will be pleased."
4,"Good, but far from perfect","This album was good, but really not 5 star material. That's reserved for album's like ""Illmatic,"" ""Strictly Business,"" and ""Ready to Die."" Slim Shady's new one is good, but not on that level. People keep saying how great the song's ""Stan"" & ""Kim"" are. I agree that they are creative, but not very good. The best track is without a doubt #15. That's one of the tightest songs I heard in a while. The rest is alright, highlighted by ""Criminal,"" ""Marshall Mathers,"" and ""I'm Back."" Shady proves on this album that he is one of the top lyricist in the rap game. If you don't have this album, you should've bought it YESTERDAY.I'm Music Master and this is the truth."
4,Marshall Mathers LP,"Eminem's new cd is awsome. Track number 10 ""im Back"" is tight. Em makes fun of everybody in this album,You should buy this album for the lyrics alone,but the beats are also phat. A MUST BUY."
5,Almost Too Hot To Touch,The is Marshal Mathers' (Eminem's) best album yet. Dispite the explicit lyrics and sick humer it is halriously funny. He has picked good backround music and good sound effects. He has realated all his songs to his life wich is interesting because you learn about his life. Slim Shady's life has been very similer to Eminiem's. I like the way he targets pop. He totally dises pop and I personly hate pop. I hope you really like this CD because I do.
4,Great follow up to Slim Shady LP,"This album had some great songs and not many bad ones.1)PSA 2000 - Intro2)Kill You 2/5 - Not bad, okay beat.3)Stan 4/5 - Great song, Dido does the chorus4)Paul - Skit5)Who Knew 4/5 - Good song, explains how he didn't realize he would cause so much hell.6)Steve Berman - Skit7)The Way I Am 5/5 - Excellent work. Explains about his fame8)The Real Slim Shady 5/5 - Fast paced ""My Name Is"" great song, classic em9)Rememeber Me 1/5 - Kind of annoying10)I'm Back 4/5 - Good beat and flow11)Marshall Mathers 3/5 - Some good rhymes12)Ken Kaniff - Skit13)Drug Ballad 2/5 - Some okay lyrics14)Amityville 2/5 - Heavy song15)Bitch Please 2 4/5 - Dre and Snoop are great16)Kim 2/5 - Heavy song, talks about Kim cheatin on him17)Under the Influence 2/5 - Good flow18)Criminal 3/5 - Some very good lyrics, not a great chorusOver all this is a very good album, a definate buy. In my opinion it's not as quite as good as the eminem show but still an awesome LP."
5,Not For Everyone,"Well, it takes getting used to, that's for sure. At first, it will be very offensive. In fact, the violence and homophobiea still offends me. However, one cannot deny that he is a lyrical genius and a great performer. His inner rhymes are on a par with Lorenz Hart, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim. His performances (especially in songs like ""Stan"" and ""Kim"") are flawless. One should not try to interpret his songs one by one, but the album as a whole. No one should try to interpret ""Kill You"" without remembering ""Stan"". In fact, no song should be taken seriously until the listener hears ""Stan"" - definately the most important song on the album. I won't tell what it's about - you either already know, or shouldn't have the surprise ruined. Eminem is a brilliant social commentator who will hopefully be creating controversy for years to come."
3,substance and rhyme?,"I just wanted to say that the first verse of ""Stan"" does indeed rhyme. Out of all of Eminem's skills, rhyming is definitely one of them. A lot of his rhymes may be too subtle for most people. A lot of his rhymes are up to par with Nas, master of Rhyme. Anyhow, speaking of substance, as the man below does, this album has substance. He is dealing with his fame and success, and at this point in his life, this is a BIG deal. Okay? He's not rhyming about the environment or consciousness as quantum theory, but criminy, look at it differently. Anyhow, ""Stan"" does have much substance....too much, it's eerie."
2,Overrated,"Em is talented but his voice is very annoying to me. He also raps about stupid things. Even the Dr. Dre beats on here aren't even all that to me. A few good tracks, mixed in with a bunch of lame ones. Em has the skill to make a really hot album, but he needs better production. This album sounds very corny and cheesy at times. Em's best album was the Slim Shady LP where he proved himself to be a witty and funny lyricist. He tries way too hard to sound all hardcore on this album."
4,eminem's second best CD,"Seeing as I have been a fan of Eminem from the very beginning, you might be a bit surprised that I just got this CD a few weeks ago- and it hasn't left my (portable) CD player since. I got this CD for his smash hit single Stan (the absolute best song on the CD), but quickly fell in love with Bitch Please II and Kill You, two other sweet songs. Eminem's second CD is what I think started him on the track he's on now: establishing himself as a world-famous rapper with more skills in his left pinkie finger than most other rappers combined. From a guy that's sure to be a lifelong fan of Slim Shady, adios and rock (or is it rap) on, Em."
5,saying the truth,"I think people that don't like this album are insane or they don't like a rapper spitting the truth ya'll know what i mean.He got some tight collasborations like snoop dogg, x to the z and the one and only doctor dre.(DR.DRE)"
4,"great beats, whack lyrics","This is an overall good album, but not eminem`s lyrics made it that good, dr.dre`s beats are again outstanding. Eminem is no real rapper, he can`t be compared to Pac or Biggie. Nevertheless you can`t go wrong with purchasing this album."
3,average,couple of dope cuts thats it i have nothing to say bout this man other then he should leave the game7 of 10 lyrics 7.5 of 10 beats
2,"too old, too quick","well, ive been an eminem fan since ""slim shady lp"", so i just had to have ""marshall mathers lp"". i got it on the first day it came out. and the first 2 months i had it i loved it! my favorite song is ""Stan"". but like 2 months later i started to hate this cd. every song (except ""Stan"") got too old! it just was so annoying hearing f- this and f- that and killing his mom and everything. if you want a real cd that actually doesnt get old, get ""slim shady lp"" (a classic). Peace! (P.S. even though i dont like this cd, i still listen to ""Stan"". but the good news for you is that they're making a video for it!(cant wait) so that means it'll probably be a single too. so just wait for that to come out.)"
5,The Shock Rap Album for the new millenium.,"The album is gritty, dark humored, aggressive and most of all shocking all the way, oh! don't forget hardcore. There hasn't been a rap album that was so vicious like marshall mathers lp since Ice Cube first two albums(Amerikkkas Most Wanted and Death Certificate). This album isn't for anyone who are easy listeners."
5,COOL,Very Good Album GENIUS Lyrics Plus Dres Beats RuleBest 4 tracksB*tch Please 2Way I AmKill YouAmityvilleWorst 4 TracksDrug BalladRemember MeMarshall MathersI'm BackBuy If U Dont Have And All The Others But The 1st Half Of Slim Shady LP Is Strong But Track 10 Onwards Is Rubbish! Also If U Like The Beats Buy Dr Dre 2001 Thats Class Or Wait For Detox Dr Dre To Be Avaible To Buy Around Late 2005 Or Early 2006!
3,nothing compared to Slim Shady LP,"... the title of the album says it all. the first album was way better lyrically; funnier and sharper social commentary.the beats were way better too. the new album's sound like they were all lifted off of a missy elliot cd.maybe after a few more listens i'll change my mind. but following the best rap cd of all time, it just seems like a disappointment."
3,Not completely satisfied.,"The CD didn't take that long to ship and seemed to be in good condition. However, on at least 3 of the songs it skips and is static the entire time, which obviously sucks, and is definitely not ""Good"" condition. If I wanted to return it it would end up costing me $$ for shipping and in the end wouldn't be worth the time for money on my end. Probably not going to risk the purchase next time."
3,Not impressed,"I am a fan of Eminem, Dre, Snoop and the whole family, but I have to say I'm not impressed with this release. There are a few songs on here that are what was expected like the Real Slim Shady and Drug Ballard, but overall the beats are dull. The lyrics are what we have come to expect and like, dirty and derogatory, but he doesn't have the beats to accompany them. I'm not upset with the purchase, but wouldn't recommend it. Borrow a friends. This is not a good follow-up to his previous outstanding release."
4,shady does it again,"this is a very good cd, the way eminems lyrics flow is near amazing, the only downfall of the cd is the guest appearances. i wanted to hear an entire cd of slim(with the exception of dre, they rock together). other than the poor skills of the other rappers, i love this cd and would definatley recomend it."
2,Eminem once again proves he has no talent...,"with the exception of stan ( a truly great song), this album is worthless. The CD is overly offensive and lacks beats. Don't even listen to track 12 or you may feel the sudden urge to vomit. The only thing giving this cd 2 stars is stan, without that, this cd would not be worth reviewing."
3,A forgetable effort,"First off, I have to address something because it really annoys me when people don't have their facts straight: THE SLIM SHADY LP WAS NOT EMINEM'S DEBUT ALBUM! It's a shame more people don't know this, and perhaps if they did, they would also appreciate what a waste of talent Eminem's latest album is.Eminem is a supremely talented MC. However, this has yet to manifest itself in a complete, substantial album. His latest is, to be perfectly blunt, pop crap. The hooks are horrible, and Dr. Dre is simply not the groundbreaking producer he once was. He does still know how to make hits, though, so if you like catchy, meaningless music, pick this up. The current state of Hip Hop makes me want to cry. I don't even feel like writing a more thorough review."
4,A Good CD but no cohesion,"One of the best rappers out today. He is not traditional rap and takes it in a new way. Perverted, hatred and filled with alot of adolescent ways of thinking, but that is okay. That is the flow of his rhymes. I agree with alot of what he has to say about it being the parents fault (to an extent) for not raising their children right. He is in a realm all his own when it comes to rap, one that has never been before. Not gangster, but dark and humorous, talking his mind.However, this cd contracts from his first CD. It is more concentrated hate and less of the humor that I like. In this CD he is too worried about his own hates and worries. It has it pluses though. He is his own brand. Just like Kid Rock who has his own blend of rock and rap. Eminem's blend is new, fresh and if you can get past the dark nature he is, then you will enjoy this CD as I did. However, it is not like his first CD and in some ways was not as good."
1,Please!,"I had to give it at least one star, cause it wouldn't let me leave none. This radio wonderboy totally sells out my having an edited CD. Why would someone change their original music and compromise their music just so some 12 year old boys mother will let him buy it, cause it's the edited version? Sell out! He has not talent, with or with out dre"
1,Wasted Money,"He's no longer funny. That's the only entertainment he could provide, unfortunately he is no longer that funny clown type of ""rapper"", very disappointing"
2,Really Shady,"When the song was out, I really liked the sound of ""The Real Slim Shady"" and so I made my decision to buy the entire album on this one track. My mistake. The problem for me was that this just was not my style of music, harder white-boy rap. If you are in to rap you might enjoy this album, but if you are buying it just for the afore-mentioned track... try and find the single or buy some sort of compilation with the song on it."
4,"Great talent, Dre ruined him though","This was a good album.I liked EMINEM underground more though. He seemed more focused on the music, not the money.The only good songs on the album were,""Stan"",""The Real Slim Shady"",Marshal Mathers"",and ""Criminal"". All the other songs he didn't seem focused on.As I said before, this album was INDEED very good.The songs such as ""Drug Ballad"",and ""B**ch Please Part 2"" were halfway decent in my view.So I advise you to buy this album.That's all you're gettin from me! Or is it......."
3,This White Boy Can Rap!,"You gotta love it. . .Eminem actually rhymes about things that are important in today's society. The lyrics seem thought out and well placed. Better yet, I was able to actually understand what he was saying when he rapped. The message came across very clearly. Only a couple bad points. All in all it's a good Cd, but it could use some more A-class songs."
1,Feminem Sucks,"I cannot believe how trash like this could possibly be popular. I mean seriously, all this guy does is drones on by swearing and making seriously offensive lyrics. Another thing is, is how he dumbs down the population by saying that this is music! I swear, some of the most stupid people I have ever met have feminem fans. How do I know, well lets just say he disses his OWN fans and yet he still sells million of albums. He also showed no support for the victims of 9/11. When other bands and artists are doing charities for them, feminem showed no sypamthy for them at all. I could go on and on about how this guy sucks but I'll let this great site do the rest www.Feminem.com. Last word of advice: DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP THAT IS FEMINEM!"
1,SAD,"From the moment i first heard eminem, i knew it was just a big joke.I still think this, now. This album has catchy tunes & music, but the lyrics are awful! It goes on & on for ages with meaningless lyrics, and awful noises. A totally sad album, from the misic to the booklet, stay well away!"
5,A Rap Classic,"One of the most controversial CDs of the last ten years, `The Marshall Mathers LP' is Eminem's sophmore release with Aftermath Music. Love him or hate him, you can't deny that this guy is one of the best lyrcists of all time. His rhyme schemes and structures are so advanced that even Rakim is probably pressing the rewind button to hear what he says again. This is a direct response to the criticism to the (not so controversial in my opinion) `The Slim Shady LP' that labeled Eminem as a hate monger, a mysogonist, and a homophobe. He fully embraces the persona with the aid of his alter-ego Slim Shady and takes it farther than any of his detractors could have imagined, brilliantly. This is one of the best `f*** you' records out there and is truly artful if you look at it right. The production is average, the lyricism is amazing, and almost every track (except `Under the Influence' which features D12) is good. Em's best work to date which he probably will never top.(4.5/5 mics)"

5,THE BEST HIP HOP ABLUM MADE !!!,"anyone who says this isn't a good album, or its 'okay', are either mentally insane or have no concept of what a good hip hop album is, this expresses hip hop in so many ways, I think this is Em's most talented album...its phenomenal...!!!!"
1,It's just not that good!,"I was a HUGE fan of Eminem's first album. I thought that he showed unlimited potential and great lyrical skill. When the first single from ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" entitled ""The Real Slim Shady"" came out I was extremely excited. He showed even more ability on that single than on any other song he had done. Unfortunately, Marshall has gone for shock value on his new disc in such a way that he completely forgets to make good music. On certain tracks he shows some of the promise displayed earlier in his career, but quickly fades into an ocean of shock lyrics for the sake of being shocking. There are really only 2 or 3 good songs on this disc. Not worth buying. Please Eminem, next time concentrate on quality, not shock value."
2,"Your 15 minutes are over, Mr. Mathers...","Eminem has finally shown the American public that he is nothing more than a one trick pony. The follow-up to his very interesting (and at times amazing) debut album is nothing more than crass ""hip pop"" which appeals to the lowest common denomenator. The production is lame, the rhymes are repetitive and uncreative, and the scenario is always the same: Hmmm, what can I do to disgust my listeners now? Don't get me wrong, Eminem does possess a great amount of mic ability (for anyone who disagrees, just listen to ""Any Man"" off the Soundbombing, Vol. 2 comp). If he would just quit trying to shock the music community and quit making songs designed to get his videos on TRL, he would be a great musical talent."
3,"Not bad, but I'd recommend his debut","On The Marshall Mathers LP, one thing is for sure: Eminem doesn't show the great musical talents he has as much as he did on his last record. Lots of the beats are very similar, and the music isn't all that impressive.And even what he's supposed to be best at, rapping, isn't as high-quality as on his debut. He always seems to be rapping about the same stuff on this one-people getting... off at him for his dirty language. There are a few good songs, like ""Stan"" and ""Criminal,"" but not enough to consider this as a great LP.If you are looking for some great Eminem rap, I would definitely recommend the Slim Shady LP. The music part of it is much better, and the rhymes are more creative."
5,Brilliant album - not for the weak at heart!,"ok. go get this album. believe me, you will not regret purchasing this album. all the songs are down-to-earth and some of it are not meant to be taken seriously - just for the fun of it. it's great to hear Eminem lambasting his mother, wife, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez, Puff Daddy, *NSync, NKOTB, Christopher Reeves, Kurt Cobain, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Spice Girls and many more. once you listen to it, you will never want to stop. P/S: don't buy this unless you have an open mind and a sense of humour AND a Slim Shady lurking inside you. This album certainly ROCKS!Period."
2,It's aight,"I copied this cd onto my computer from my friend, but i never put it on a cd. The beats on the cd were some of the best i have heard, but eminem doesn't really rap about anything on this cd. i loved his last cd, but this one is no where as good. other rappers are rapping about things that they go through or things that have meanin and it is worth listening to. But the except for a couple songs, the lyrics on this cd made me embaressed to listen to it around any of my friends or family. I would tell someone unless you don't listen to lyrics and only listen to the beats, ..., i consider it a disgrace to rap.b ,b ,jb"
3,EMINEM THE MARSHALL MATHERS CD REVEIW,I THINK THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP IS A HARDCORE RAP ALBUM BUT IT'S NOT EMINEMS BEST ALBUM I MEAN IT'S GOT GOOD SONGS LIKE STAN AND THE REAL SLIMSHADY BUT IT'S AS GOOD AS THE EMINEM SHOW ALBUM THE FLOW IS NOT AS GOODON THIS CD BUT ANWAY WHO KNEW IS A GOOD SONG TOO. BUT I GOT THIS ALBUM EDITED BECAUSE IT'S TO VOIENT IN EXPLICIT VERSON OF THE ALBUM BUT IT'S A GOOD ALBUM THANKS FOR READING MY REVEIW WELL SEE YOU.
1,The Marshall Mathers LP [EXPLICT LYRICS],Eminem Shouldn't have quit his day Job I borrowed the album listened through part of some of the songs and turned it off it's the worst thing yet since Eminem's start as a wannabe rapper he he cant sing with out profanity it makes me sick. Work a Burger king ...
1,BEEEEEEEP!!!,"Beeeeeep!Beeeeeeep! unless you want to listen to beeep! all the time, then get the unedited one. i dont recomend it to little kids! i recomend the UNEDITED one to little kids! i mean come on, they are going to learn these words sometime in their lives. i am a big eminem fan, but not for the edited ones!"
4,Lighten up.............,"If your offended by anything, this CD isn't for you. This CD is a much needed slap in the face to the ""pc"" public. With songs like ""Who Knew"" and ""Criminal"". How many people take shots at Christopher Reeves? Well Eminem does and it's funny. If you can't laugh at some of the lyrics on this CD then what do you laugh at? Eminem is a riot, and he isn't just a ""white rapper"", he's a rapper. Period. Don't take everything so serious, it's just music."
4,Good CD but a little bit intense,"I am not usually a fan of rap, but I really liked this CD. To parents and those who can't really handle Eminem's extreme personality this CD is difenitely not for u. I really have a problem with ""Kim."" The song gave me nightmares after the first time I listened to it... now I just program my CD player to skip it. The whole thing about beating and then killing his wife after he catches her cheating is just a little too intense for me. Eminem shows origality with this CD. If u just like his song ""The Real Slim Shady,"" the rest of the CD is not really like it. The ""Real Slim Shady"" is pretty much the only song that can be played on the radio. He says some really outragious things in this CD. All in all this CD is really good but also really intense."
4,Some AWESOME tracks in this CD,"I think that they have some cool songs on this cd. My best track is number 8! Number 8 is I'm Still Shady I'm the Real Shady all the other Slim Shadies are just imitating! YEAH! The rest range from 0.0 to ok! What i mean is that some songs are downright boring! Number 13, 15, 5, 2, 3, and number 17 is cool. Number 17 is also funny! It goes ""Shney Ney Ney Ney Ney Ney Ney Ne Nekh"""
1,He's wack...,"Eminem's ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" is pretty much another weak release by diz wigger just like his previous albums his album after diz one and his latest one... It's all weak. All feminem realy wishes he was ? Was a black person like so many white idiots today and as i've said before ? if i see any white boy on my block period let along seeing them wearing doo-rag or baggy pants ? I will hurt them.Anyways, tmmlp by eminem is corny and im sorry but his lirycs are terrible even dre's prodduction dont save this album abit...Im realy glad i didn't buy it but simply heard it on the cdstore cuz feminem's music ain't worth my money but just my bashing. Peace ! Dont buy eminem's ""the marshall mathers lp"" if you still haven't and hate him and you thinkin about givein him a chance ? Just don't ight ? Stick to real hip-hop ,1 !"
3,I listen to it for the laughs,"Don't get me wrong, I probably know every word on this cd. I do enjoy it, but as far as quality... it's not so hot. Seems like all of the pesimistic stuff... kill em, screw em, beat em, bla bla bla... which critics attack, and MM himself claims is part of his everyday life is just interesting. It is DEFINETLY a little too hot for some, meaning not all can handle it. But there are some definite good beats, catchy lyrics, and so on. A downer would be the annoying interludes either reasuring us once again the Mather's doesn't care what we think, or some nasty action that most of us don't want to hear... now you're curious huh. I don't think this is a very good cd, probably not worth all it costs, but if you're interested it can be some fun."
2,"When it says ""edit,"" its supposed to mean it","Id like to start off by saying that buying the clean version of this cd is a waste of money. I enjoy Eminems music, but a young child should NOT be listening to this, edited or otherwise. Eminem edited out the bare minimum of swearing and profanity, leaving in n**ger, b**ch, s**t and drugs and kill about half the time. With this cd, buy the unedit, or dont buy it at all."
4,NOT AS GOOD AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!,"I LIKE EMINEM BUT IN THIS ALBUM HIS BEATS SOUND ALOT LIKE DRE'S BEATS IN THE CHRONIC 2001.HE CHANGED HIS STYLE IN 1 YEAR I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT IT'S LIKE IT'S MORE MELLOW OR SOMETHING.HERE'S THE GOOD TRACKS 2,3,5,7,8,10,15,17,18.9-18."
5,He has done it again!,"Eminem has done it again. This album is off the wall! Its lyrics and ideas are great. It deals with some issues in a way teens will hear them. People who are upset about him ""picking"" on them need to get over it. Eminem's entire LP is right on target. He is a great rapper. Not a great white rapper, simply a great rapper."
5,Eminem...back and better than before,"This is the tightest CD that I have ever purchased. If you do not own this album at the time you read this, pick it up now. If you are a fan of clever lyrics and masterful beats, then you will love this CD. If you do not like this CD, then you are not a fan of rap."
3,Not what i was expecting,"The marshall mather lp wasnt what i had expected. The cd is cool its got some good songs but its not better than the first one. Eminem has the ability to do better, working with dr dre this shouldve been the best cd ever, but...."
4,The REAL review,"Im giving this disk a 4 out of 5 because the ranking 5 is just so easy to give to any CD that's okay.. The 5 rank is reserved for the best of the best. The rank is my current opinon.I think that this new Cd is un-real. Marshall is undoubtedly one of the hardest rappers today with the lyrical content on this CD. I have to commend Dre also with his producing.. the beats on this disk are amazing.And remeber folks, I am rating the ""CD"" and not the MP3's! Peace, and much love to ya'll"
2,UMMM did I miss something?,"I'm sorry, I picked up this album the other day because I so much enjoyed ""the real slim shady"". After I heard the song ""Kim"" I had nightmares. Even now I cannot understand why this song was written, why people think it's a good song and why people aren't as mortified as I am. ... I am very disturbed that a song like this is on one of the best selling albums of the year.ility to compile and deliver such a torrent of words with such speed, precision, inflection, and meaning. The only bad track on the disc is #3, ""Stan,"" but maybe it will grow on me in time. ""Kim"" is, as MTV's Kurt Loder said, ""the most disturbing thing I've ever heard,"" but it makes me glad that Eminem gets this stuff out in the studio, instead of in real life. His wife must be one cool lady to be able to separate her husband from his various alter egos. Keep it up, you two."
1,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Eminem is the soundtrack for ""The Future Losers of America"". All of his songs are negative and spiteful and meant to bring out the worst in humanity. ""Stan"" contains lyrics that promote the killing of homosexuals (well at least that's the way I interpret ""stabbing a fag or a lez"" means). Listen and deteroirate."
1,Enough about your mom already...,"Unlike the first albumn which had 1 ok song, this has none. I'd like to like Emenem, but the album is nothing more than rants .... Nothing origional, no musical value, .... I get what he says, and frankly I don't blame him for hating his mother/family and his issues with society. But good music this isn't. Teens won't get the irony of the albumn, and just pick up the lame white boy gangster mentality we just don't need. How Dre let this one get away from him I'm not sure..."
5,The Way He Is...,"DAMN...when I thought about the CD before I bought it, I thought that it wouldn't be as good as the Slim Shady LP. So, I was sceptical before buying this. Then I popped it into my CD player after I bought it and I was blown away from the first track...it's funny as hell. And the first actual song...Kill You...DAMN! It was sweet as hell! Then you have the best conceptual song ever and probably the best song Eminem has ever done...Stan. You just feel for Stan and how Eminem is sorry for not writting to him earlier. Then there are songs like The Way I Am, I'm Back, Marshall Mathers, Kim, and Criminal that are great. The rest of the songs are good, but the worst song on the CD is Remember Me...it sounds so bad.This is probably going to earn yet another Grammy on Eminem's shelf next year...even though he doesn't give a damn about a grammy!"
5,How does he do it?,"Eminem has definitely topped his also-spectacular Slim Shady LP. The new disc is much more musical and much more lyrically challenging, and it reflects the expanded experience that Eminem has gone through since Slim Shady came out. The second track, ""Kill You,"" is hilarious, and his versatility and tongue-twisting lyrical style makes me listen to certain passages over and over again---even though I understood what he said the first time---just marveling at his ability to compile and deliver such a torrent of words with such speed, precision, inflection, and meaning. The only bad track on the disc is #3, ""Stan,"" but maybe it will grow on me in time. ""Kim"" is, as MTV's Kurt Loder said, ""the most disturbing thing I've ever heard,"" ..."
5,Eminem,"I didnt know what to expect when i bought this cd but i dont regret my purchase one bit. after ""the real slim shady"" there a still many good tracks where em shows his talents with words. just dont actually take anything he says seriously."
2,You can barely hear anything.,I got the edited one because my mom won't let me get the dirty one. The dirty one is way better because you can't hear anything on the edited one.1. PSA 2000: they cut this song out2. Kill You: This is a great example on how horrible edited cd's are. About every 2 seconds somthing is bleeped out and it scews up the song. 1/53. Stan: This is a great song. 5/54. skit5. who knew: can't hear anything6. skit7. Way i am: Best song ever. 5/58. Real Slim Shady: HOrrible 2/59. horrlible 2/510. good 3/511. horible 2/512. This is so [inappropriate].13. funny 4/514. horrible 2/515 bad 2/516. They changed this song to a south park song. funny 4/517. great song 6/518. great song 4/5BUY THE DIRTY ONE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE ME
1,Pure gay garbage!,I completely despise this guy feminem who by the way has no real musical talent he's just a white trash whiny baby who just thinks people including his fans owe him a favor by kissing his arse. Theres nothing truly good on this pure discharge album theres no real music all it has is a spew of swearing and all his hate discrimination towards women homos his mom and his girlfriend' now I can't really call this music because it's not music at all.Don't give your money to this whiny talentless clown' support real musicians who make real music not some vulgar whiny baby like feminem.I Hope one day all the fans will find much better things than this literally!Feminem you suck!
1,worst,"i don't like eminem at all... HE IS dissing his own parents to get recongnition, he himself is a PHONY, he thinks the world owes him, well i just wanna tell him that, he's not the only one from a dyfunctional family, many famous people were from much worst situation that he's in, or was, and those famous people get much more fame by working hard and following the right path, and they are much more successful than eminem."
1,Rap is crap,"What the Hell is this? A white guy that is rapping and wanting to be black, what a race traitor. Eminem needs to be shot. I used to hear some of these songs when they played them at games in high school, This music is absolutly crap, all rap is crap for that matter. Eminem is such a loser, he has no talent, rap takes no talent, all it is is a beat machine and a turntable and some stupid uneducated person attemting to ""sing"". Give me a break. I'd rather die than listen to this garbage. Do your self a favor and flush your money down the toilet, that is better than wasting it on this piece of trash. Rap Sucks!"
1,Disgust,"Well, I feel that anything with such horrible production and ill placed beats deserves this rating. Shock appeal is the key.. ..."
5,WARNING,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE UNEDITED VERSION, ALL THE WAY THROUGH. IF YOU DO, I SWEAR YOU'LL GO INSANE. That's how bad this C.d. is. It's packed with killings, drugs, and worst of all, life. It's a really negitive c.d., but buy it if your a hard-core rap fan. ... If you'd rather have music that sings about love and how great life is (in other words, ""If you'd rather have music that lies to you."") Buy somthin else. I personally LIKE music that dishes out the truth, even if it is harsh. But I guess that's just me.t you should be liking it for the commical and shock value of it, and not the ""meaning"" of his music. (Pretty insightful for a 15 year old.)ill find this album to be very good.Peace to all the true hip hop headz out there. And a fat d-ck to all you ""anti-rap"" and ""politically correct"" co-ksuckers."
4,stop complaining,"Ok, so people are complaining about Em's new cd, especially the song ""Kim"". I have to admit that I don't own the cd, I've just listened to it from friends, and I was amazed at what I heard. I think that the song ""Kim"" is one of the most amazing songs I have ever heard in my life. It provokes an emotional response from the listener--it tells a story that other artists don't tell. It contains real emotions, and it's too bad that some people are too afraid to admit that the ""vulgur"" and ""disturbing"" lyrics are what makes the song that much more powerful and honest. I plan on buying the cd, and it's all thanks to that one song. Listen to it, you won't regret it."
4,One of the best rap CDS to date,...the CD is great. Eminem pushes the envelope (like he always does) even further than his debut release. People keep yapping about his lyrics and him hiding behind all this psychological nonsense. The truth is that there are many people that do understand his sense of humor ..... He just has the brass ones to put it on an album and let everyone here the jokes. Do not let any of these naysayers ward you off. This is one of the best rap CDs that you can find. It seems rare anymore to find a cd that you can play from start to finish and not have to hit the skip button. ...this is a cd worth having.
2,try the real thing,"First things first: this is the CLEAN version of the cd. OK, so saying, thats why i gave this a low rating. It's not the best of eminem's cds, but its still good. However, the clean version is HORRIBLE. You can barely listen to it, so much is bleeped out.They even cut out dumb stuff like ""cut"". The only thing I like on this cd is the song ""the kids"" which i cant find on the unedited version of the marshall mathers lp. its a very good song even though it is edited. so my advice to u is to get the unedited version if u like eminem. its a good cd, worth the money."
5,Very nice mmmm.... oh yes,"This album is very, very good, The Real Slim Shady will go down as one of those other rock solid Rap classics. Grand master Flash-White lines, Sugerhill Gang-Rappers Delight, all come to mind whenever I listen to, and even think about this album, will be a true classic indeed. Very, very good, it'll put a wicked smile right across your face for a good hour after it's finished."
5,"""Forget About Stan Like You Forgot About Dre""","My review doesn't compete against the rest of these reviews but I wanted to get a point across. I know everybody's favorite song off this CD is ""the real slim shady"" & ""stan"", yeah those songs are great but this CD has so much more to offer there are alot of more great songs on this CD than just ""stan"". Like I said ""Forget about Stan"" like you ""Forgot about Dre. Buy this CD and enjoy it but don't just listen to ""the Real Slim Shady"" & just ""Stan"" listen to the whole CD I am sure you will like it just as much as you like those 2 tracks."
5,Hard Hittin' Stuff,"Woah! Its been a long time since I bought an album on spec but this one really paid off. Eminem is sooooo witty and he says all the stuff that half the time I wish I had the balls to say, not only this he does to the tune of catchy riffs and cool samples. Every time I listen to it I hear a line that I missed before. Luckily, having a sense of humour, I know better than to take half the stuff too seriously but I would worry that there are looneys out there who will take it to heart and do the kinda stuff that he sings about. This is going to be playing on a loop on my stereo for a long time yet. He the man!"
4,Went a little to far Em,Eminem is a very good rapper the white media just over rates him to much. The best song on there is Stan but people act like that is the best song every made. But any way this album is good Eminem just got too fu**ing crazy on Kim and Kill you. My God Eminem.
4,EM is sweet,"This album is so cool and awsweme! I really like The real Slim Shady! Yo! it's da best so ya gotta buy dis album ya see, its coo'. Eminem is da bomb! YEAH!"
5,If Your A Rap Fan You Can't Not Get This CD,"Its true Em may have some explicit lyrics, but all in all its only how the guy feels. His rhymes are great and filled with some humor that you mght be a certain age to get. But it also has a clean version for you over protective prents.Even though he has a bad rap the guy is artist whose sold millions so don't protest someone who makes more money than you.Yes I may be 13, but my mother trusts me not to take it literally and neither should anyone else. If you don't believe me then don't buy it, but if you do please don't try anything of it at home or deeply believe what he says."
5,Violent Masterpiece,"You know, it's funny. When I bought this waayyy back in May 2000 i was really takin' a chance. I popped it in my cd player and flipped on my playstation so i could listen while i played. bam. I listened to it over and over. I must have listened to Stan 1000 times that night. This album is the end-all, be-all of music lover's everywhere. run to the cd store to buy it. NOW!"
5,Amazing!!!!,"I love this c.d!!! It was worth buying it. Every song is excellent. I listen to it all the time. Belive me, if you like rap, or anything, this is the c.d to get!!!!"
5,One word... WOW!,"Okay, I'm not really sure what to say about this cd except for that it is incredible. The lyrics on every song are amazing, most of the skits are funny (except for Ken Kaniff, which is nasty), and all of the beats are incredible. I can only say that so many times, the beats and lyrics are both incredible. This cd is one of the best rap cds of all time and it is Eminem's finest moment, in my opinion. The Slim Shady LP was classic, and so were the Eminem Show and Encore, but this tops them all. I highly recommend this cd because it is insanely awesome."
4,A+,"Brings me back to my teens.good album, dont know what else to really say about it apart from i bought this ages ago and am only just reviewing it. i dont even know where it is and ill probly end up buying it again for my ipod."
5,This boy has one TWISTED mind!,"This CD is full of twisted, but great fun. It has many different types of tracks, from The Real Slim Shady, to Criminal, to the skit Ken Kaniff. It is a must for all rap lovers."
4,A little too crude but still good,"Eminem is an excellent lyricist. He has a mastery of coming up with intelligent rhymes. But from a female point of view, he goes a little too far. He's married to his wife now and he still sings about killing her. I can't listen to Kim because the violence against his wife makes me uncomforable. Paul is a great song. The beat is good and I like the woman singing in the background. The lyrics is what makes the song so powerful. All in all a definite buy but female listeners beware."
5,this cd rocks!!!!!!!,this is the best eminem cd i got it when it came out and it is the best of all the eminem cd's you will not waste your money on buying this cd!!!
5,What a wicked album!,"This has got to be one of the dopest albums in recent years! I bought it on the day of release in the UK, and it is one of the best albums I have heard. Eminem comes stronger than ever: just check the tracks about his obssessive fan, 'Stan', if you don't believe me! It's as funny, if not funnier, in places, than 'Slim Shady LP', and to keep you Dre heads happy, features RBX, Dre, X to the Z Xzibit, Snoop, Nate and even ex Onyx member Sticky Fingaz. Buy this album!"
5,Public Service Announcement,"This CD is pretty cool. All of the songs are good, but you should buy this album because it has arguably the best song out right now: ""The Real Slim Shady."" For Eminem fans, this is a great addition to your collection. I highly recommend this album by the one and only Eminem!"
5,A GREAT FOLLOW UP TO THE BEST RAP ALBUM OF 1999!,"The new album is definatly a great follow up to ""The Slim Shady LP."" Eminem still proves that he does not care what anybody thinks about him. With songs like ""The Way I am"" anwsers right back to everyone that talked back to him. The song ""Stan,"" is about an obsessed fan who kills himself and his girlfriend because he doesn't anwser his letters and follow what eminem says in his songs. In ""The Real Slim Shady"", He makes fun of Tom Green, boy bands, Christina Agulera. She was very upset about it too. The album is really a good come back for Eminem against people who talked bad about him in the past year. He also wants to let you know that he is back and here to stay, although he never really left."
3,Means something special to me,"This was the first hip-hop album i ever bought. I thought it was really great, and i listened to it all the time. My favorites was Criminal(18) and The Real Slim Shady(8). I just couldn't get enough of it!After a while, I started to listen to artists as Gang Starr. Jeru the Damaja, KRS-One, Nas, and many others. I think Eminem doesn't have a chance against the hip hop of the 90's.I don't listen to Eminem any more, and his newest albums is nothing but desperate tries of earning money....This album still get a 3 star, because it got me into hip-hop. I think the best tracks are Remember me(9) and Amityville(14). Don't think Eminem fans agree with me there...Old school 4 ever"
