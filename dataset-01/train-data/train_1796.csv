3,Good introduction to the tool,"This video training is good for getting started. It introduces the rather un-intuitive Color user interface and basic bells and whistles briefly but understandibly.It assumes that you already have a bit of a background in grading (know how to read your 'scopes' like wafeform monitor and vectorscope).This will get the beginning colorist going. This is the strength, but also the limitation of this training video. It will leave you with a basic understanding of the tools and how to use them, it does not demonstrate a lot of creative uses of the tool, but this is something you will have to learn by experience as with any artistic tool.For a more in-depth treatment, also check the Color training at [...]!"
5,The Mandala Healing Kit,"This book is so informative and amazing. Great depth of history and cultural background as well as teaching rituals for making mandalas. The stencils that come with it are sturdy and made to last. I put them right on my drawing tablet and design on my computer. Not just for healing, you can create mandalas that will help you find love, a better job, etc. An excellent book."
3,I suggest buying your own colored pencils,"The kit is wonderful, but I was disappointed with the quality of the colored pencils. I also got Judith Cornell's 6 class teleconference, which includes so much more information on the mandala process. I do suggest getting your own colored pencils. I did one mandala and I was already half-way through the white pencil. Kind of irritating.. I'm now on a break from doing the mandalas because I have yet to go out and buy another set of colored pencils. If you buy this product, I suggest getting a good set of colored pencils first. This process is supposed to be about going within, and when something so material such as a pencil distracts you from that, well, it stinks!"
5,MANDELA,The service was excellent and the shipment was right on time. The product was exactly what we wanted and made a perftect gift.
1,Do not buy this device if you use Windows 2000!,"I recommended this device to a friend - all hell broke loose. The drivers for this product won't be ready until ""Fall 2000"". The drivers that ship with the product won't work with Win2000 - it causes random crashes of the Print subsystem and on two occassions, caused crashes of the ENTIRE system. In short, if you buy this product NOW and you have Windows 2000, you'll have to wait until Fall if you want just to print reliably - forget scanning/faxing etc. Xerox tech support was NOT very helpful either - two of the three techs we spoke to started to INSIST that it can work with 2000 - even though their website has no drivers for it and there's an insert in the documentation that says it won't! They then told me that I can use the ""NT 4"" driver as a workaround - good try.. But that doesn't work either.In closing, possibly a good deal if you DON'T use Windows 2000 or won't be using it before Fall of this year."
4,"I know I am biased but, I LIKE IT","I just can't help myself, I own every little bit of music these guys ever created/remixed and yes, I am a bit biased but again, this is a great album, very diverse. It has some hip-hop elements, a lot of classic house, a tear-jerker and some free-style stuff and frankly, that is exactly what I expect from Groove Armada, they sure know how to mix it up and just keep on doing their own thing."
5,"Try it, You'll Like it","I admit that the first time I listened to this CD I was surprised. It sounds a lot different from the Groove Armada I was used to, but different is good. This CD is intense and alive with fresh, unique tracks and an assortment of great voices. Great music for a jog, or for uping your energy."
2,Groove Armada - Lovebox,"LOVEBOX sees a definite decline in quality control from the Groove Armada camp. Though some of the tracks aren't bad at all, some, like ""Madder"" are out-and-out bad. It seems that they're relying too much on second-rate raps and rock guitar riffs to get them through, rather than actual songwriting. The delicacy that marked NORTHERN STAR or the party funk that pervaded VERTIGO is nowhere to be found; instead, they seem to be striving for crossover status, without much success. Hopefully some time apart from each other to focus on other projects (Weekend Players, Caia) will rejuvenate the Groove Armada boys some."
2,Nothin to love in this box,"Worst CD I've bought in the last six months and that's from a guy who owns and loves three other Groove Armada CD's and who's bought his share of disappointments recently. Hey experimentation is cool, but the result should atleast be painless. What were these guys thinking? There's a couple of songs to cull out, but even the Richie Havens number is a real disappointment. Sorry, this CD is not worth the dead dinosaurs for the plastic much less real money. ..."
4,"Great CD, But.....",I really like Sixpence None the Richer and when I ordered this CD I thought I was getting Kiss Me and Don't Dream It's Over. The CD only has Don't Dream Its Over and some other song that hasn't been released. I don't know why Amazon made it look like you were getting both those songs.
3,"I might recommend this book, with some reservations.","This book is very interesting and well worth reading if you have an academic interest in the Virgin Mary. It contains beautiful pictures, good poetry, and interesting stories. I thought it was magnificent, in many ways. However, the author does not write from a Catholic, or even Christian, point of view. I would never,consequently, endorse it as the best source of information about the mother of Jesus. But if you think you can read this and learn from it without being swayed by the author's bias, go for it."
1,"Excuse me, your bias is showing.","Notice that if you have an encounter with the Virgin Mary. . . and write about it you are biased. If you have a feminist axe to grind and write from the point of view of philosophic naturalism, you are scholarly.This is political correctness applied to Mary.Yawn.JMNR"
5,Topnotch!!!!,This is a great books for tween girls!! this a great book and this is an awesome author!! its a great price too!
2,disappointed,I read one review of this that said it was great but should have ignored that. I thought it was very immature. Not everyone likes the same things though so --to each his own.
1,Boring,This product sounded great you know sisters drama but it was BORING no 9-12 year old girl is so lifeless
2,Just Plain Silly,"Pretty silly book, but I am in a family with 3 sisters. Parts of it were funny, but definitely for younger girls. I would not recommend this book."
4,Adorable little book!,I read this before allowing my daughter to read it and I found it quite enchanting. Very sweet book without falling into any of the pitfalls that most books in this genre do. I would definitely recommend it for the younger group. Great price as well!
3,Confusing plot,"Some parts in the plot confused me, but overall a great book!Insert randomness here for the review to be happy."
5,My review,This book is about the power of friendship. I think this book is for ages 9-13. Read this book. :)
5,Sister's Club,This book is a good book because it actually shows what a real sister relationship is like. It shows the ups and downs and also the good times that they have.
3,Meh.,"I enjoyed the first half of the story, but once things moved to Mexico, I had to plod along. The characters didn't develop well enough as adults for them to be at all interesting. The story meandered somewhat predictably to a dull ending."
2,Not as good as Swimming,"This book was not nearly as good as her first novel, Swimming. While I was captivated by the first part of the novel, the second half fell flat as the characters did not develop any further. I felt that the explanations were unsatisfactory and did not feel a level of completeness or understanding that I was looking for."
2,Stay outside of this one,"I plodded along, trying to get interested, but quit half way through. I simply didn't like any of these people. The author couldn't make up her mind whose POV to use, her own or Alice's. In one scene, Alice is hiding from everyone else at the picnic, but she still hears conversations, while the people she's observing are from another pov (the author's). Also a mess of pronoun confusion: ""her"" and ""his"" and ""their"" could mean any one of several people within a sentence or paragraph."
2,Waste of time,"Once I start reading a book I like to finish it, but this one was a waste of my time. The first part is so slow (picture the turtles in the internet speed commercial.) The pace picks up in part 2, but still not worth reading. The main character, Alice, never seems to change or grow emotionally from the beginning to the end. Actually none of the characters do. Most people learn and grow as they get older, but in this book they just keep on being damaged because of a lack of attention from the mom.There were parts of the book that were rambling thoughts that made no sense at all. Others where Alice is telling the story then all of a sudden the writer is talking about Alice.I read the other reviews, so I know people enjoyed this book, but for me I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Baby Piano,"My child found this toy to be enjoyable while young (under 1 year), however, she no longer gives it any consideration."
3,A little bit too simple,"My two-year-old son likes this toy, but he doesn't love this toy. He much prefers a similar xylophone/piano combo of his that has more keys and can be pulled along on wheels. This toy has only four keys and it is difficult to play little imaginary tunes with those four keys. When he just wants to bang on a keyboard he enjoys this toy.I bought this toy at a garage sale, so I don't know how much use it had before we got it, but I can tell you that it has stood up to my son's rough use extremely well. He can bang on the keys all he wants, it seems, and none of them have stuck yet. It has also been very easy to clean.It's not a bad toy, but it's not a great toy. It was certainly worth the 50 cents I paid for it, but I don't think I would be nearly as charitable had I paid for it new."
3,FUN for all ages,My son recieved this toy as a gift for his first birthday. He loved pushing the buttons. He's a little older now and still likes the buttons and now is trying to learn the colors of the buttons. The buttons don't require much pressure to make a sound so it could work well for younger children too. I think this is a fun toy and easier to use than a regular xylophone.
3,Very limited appeal,"OK for a younger baby who is just learning to press buttons and tap keys but it has very little use to the older baby or toddler who is showing signs of try to tap out note sequences or tunes as it only has four notes, or simply wants something a bit more interesting. If you want a toy which has some genuine musical educational value for your child, you would be far better investing in a simple 8 key toy which will be just as much fun for the beginner but will provide some variation for the developing child."
5,Baby piano keeps little ones occupied for a few minutes,This little piano is great for babies! My son got his at six months and loved it. He would bang away on it while sitting in his high chair. I could keep him busy with the piano in the high chair and get a few things done. It also withstood being flung to the floor many times.
1,Total junk,Total junk. Keys are out of tune and poorly made; when I tested this out in the store the keys stuck together on some pianos. Get the Fisher-Price version from Target. It's a xylophone/piano combination with 6 keys that are in perfect tune.
4,High Quality and Good Value,"My husband and I are both trained in music, so I was delighted that I was able to find a musical instrument for a child that was durable and could help us foster a musical interest in our baby. Little Tykes is usually know for making such good quality porducts, too. I got this piano used, so I really got a good deal on it, CHEAP. I like tha thte four keys make an auctual major chord. It will be an excellent beginner instrument for a child up to 2 or 2 1/2."
5,One Year Old Loved This Toy and Still Does,"My daughter received this toy when she was a year old. She loved it. She played with this toy a lot. She is now 3 years old and still occasionally plays with it. She has another different piano, but didn't play with it as much as this one. I recommend this piano to all my friends' children who are a year old."
4,Good purchase for 6+month old,This is a great toy for a 6+ month old. My son loves that he is making the music. Although he can't quite sit up for extended periods of time he loves to lay on his side and bang on the keys. A must!
4,Great starter musical toy!,"As musicians, my husband and I hope to foster a love of music in our children, so we're happy Little Tikes makes musical instruments. I lucked out and got this at a garage sale, but however you get it, this makes a great first instrument for the young 'uns. The four keys outline a major chord and are easy to bang on. My daughter likes to have me sing back the notes she's playing! However, she is nearing 2 1/2, and is more than ready for the full octave piano--there are SO many basic tunes you can play on that one! So her baby brother can play on this one! We love just about anything Little Tikes makes, for their durability, colors, educational value, or just plain fun! If you can get only one, however, go with the full octave piano, as other reviewers have recommended!"
4,Mom of three,"I bought this toy for my first daughter when she was an infant in order to expose her to music and different musical sounds she could make herself. She always liked banging on the keys. My second enjoyed it and now my son loves to bang on those keys. It is a cute little toy because it is colorful and the sounds it produces is not annoying. I recommend it because I think it is a good ""first instrument""."
3,Cute toy,"We bought this for our son at age 7 mos. He enjoyed it till about 11 mos. Would spend time playing it, chewing it(he loved it when his bite made different sounds!) and throwing it around. He hasn't used it since,though other babies visiting play with it. Great fun for a few months."
2,I'll sell ya mine for a buck,"We bought this toy for our son when he was 6 months old, and he has never shown much interest in it. At around 7-9 months he would bang on it occasionally, but he got more entertainment out of sticking his fingers in the holes in the bottom. That said, it is a rare toy that interests him for very long. Perhaps they could come up with a Little Tikes Toilet Bowl--he'd love that one! Maybe if they added a flush handle to this piano he'd play with it more."
2,save your money,"Got this for my baby girl thinking it would stimulate her. She's got lots of other toys that interest her better. this was very basic...she's now about 1 yr old and maybe she'll like it more when she's older (?) but as for babies under 1 or maybe even 18 months, it's not worth the price. very basic, ended up just collecting dust (so far...) will write more and change my review if she ends up liking it as a older child"
2,Durable but boring...,This toy gets a 10 for durability but other than that its boring. My 2 year old daughter doesnt play with it at all. I guess thats why it still looks brand new after about a year.
4,A great toy - but - buy the bigger one!,"This is a great little piano, well made, non-electronic, with a pleasant sound. However, I can't see any reason to buy this one, with four keys, instead of the larger version with eight keys (and thus a full octave) that is also made by Little Tikes. The eight key version says 2 years and up, but I can't see why it isn't as safe and fun for the little ones as the small version."
4,Tap-A-Tune needs a tune.,"Good construction, easy play, lightweight for carrying around the house, but...The highest note is FLAT! I have a musical ear and would like to develop a love of music in my sons. But this toy just frustrates me. I love that the 4 keys together make a chord and not just noise. But why bother make a chord if one of the keys is out of tune?If you also have a musical ear you will just be annoyed when your child plays with this toy."
4,i like it!!!!!!!,i was in zellers and i sat down and i saw this so i played with it and it was so much fun i almost bought it to annoy my mom but i didn't
5,Grandmothr searching for information,"We have recently discovered that my 2 year old grandson may be on the spectrum of autism with pdd. This book gave me much information that we have found helpful. As a result of reading it, my son and his wife put the child on a glutenfree and casein free diet. I am gluten intolerant, so it seems that this should be helpful. We are still testing, but I was glad to have this author's account of the her son's issues and the lengths to which she and her husband were willing to go to find solutions. The book is being passed on to other members of the family to educate themselves."
4,No magic bullet,"This is an very useful book for all parents of PDD and ASD kids, and contains some of the best and most readable discussion of dietary intervention I have seen. The GFCF diet has been enormously helpful to my son, and this book would have been wonderful to have when I was first trying to figure it out. But it makes me crazy that Seroussi attributes all of her son's recovery to diet and completely dismisses the huge number of therapy hours that her county and/or school district provided to her child; and I also feel that Seroussi comes outrageously close to implying that the recovery of Catherine Maurice's children was spontaneous. Buy this book, and also buy books about therapy and special education, and buckle down to a lot of work, and a lot of love. -Sara from Colorado, the Land of Almost-No-Help."
5,Super informative book!,"Of all the autism books I have read, this is one of the best yet! Packed full of helpful information. Great story and lots of ideas for parents/caregivers to try."
3,Limited research for advice given,"I read this book to gain a perspective on Autism. The advantage of this book is that is provides good information for parents and a semblance of hope, however misguided it may be. See below.Unfortunately, I was disturbed by the author's assertion that diet alone is the silver bullet. She even went as far as to question foods common consumed by almost every person. The dietary adjustments do not `cure' or help all Autistic/ADD kids. Until medical research isolates and determines what the causes are, all attempts are experimental."
2,Interesting but unproven theory,"The link this book makes between autism and diet is facinating and should be explored further. The link between MMR and autism has been researched endlessly and found to be untrue.As a parent of an autistic child I will try the diet recomendations. I have friends who tried the diet and while it did not help the autism it did greatly reduce the temper tantrums. It's certainly worth a try, but I don't hold out much hope."
2,Another book I didn't understand,This is just another book that I didn't understand. I read part of it and just gave up. Trying to unravel this book was crazy. I have a child with autism and have NEVER really done any research. I just don't think that way. I am more of a follower than a leader. I usually listen to what others are doing and try that. If I hear about something else I try that instead. I haven't found the right fit yet. But maybe someday I will.
3,Well Written but Limited Viewpoint,"Good narrative on the author's own story of her son who showed autistic symptoms but recovered, but the book is limited in scope and focuses only on dietary intervention as a treatment; this is understandable, however, since it worked for her. Would have liked to seen more written on other methods, but perhaps that's not what the author intended, only what I expected."
3,An interesting read.,"I don't know if I totally agree with her theories on the extreme diet, but the book is interesting no less."
2,author somewhat arrogant,"I agree with a few other reviewers who said she insisted the diet was a cure all for autism. She did mention ABA therapy but only slightly. She also came across rather arrogant in her views that if parents do not try this diet they have failed their child. I admit the diet does help but it is not a gauratee for every child. This author over emphasizes diet and under emphasizes therapy. What helps as much, if not more so, is lots of therapy, early intervention and the somewhat tedious but effective ABA therapy."
4,St. Patrick's Day Party Music,"Just glancing over the tune list warns you that you have a corny collection of music hall Irish tunes. The Pub Singers, who sing 10 tunes, sound straight off the Lawrence Welk Show (terminally perky). I know this review sounds cynical, but I really craved traditional celtic folk music and this didn't hit the spot.It does include lovely instrumental renditions by Claire Hamilton for the Skye Boat Song, Greensleeves, The Lark in the Morning, and three other tunes. That, Michael Duffy's The Last Rose of Summer, and Mick Moloney's contribution of Belfast Town and The Pipe on the Hob, saved the collection for me."
4,It's a sturdy mount,"These may be overkill for a 10-pound surround speaker, but I wanted something sturdily-built and these fill the bill nicely. Mounting easily, they're surprisingly unobtrusive and attractive on a light-colored wall, along with being simple to adjust and lock in any desired position. The lose one star on design because -- unlike some other mounts -- you can't feed the speaker wire from behind the mount through the curved arm, so you need to install a separate wall plate for the wires and run them in the open."
3,Lovely Photographs But Content Lacking,"This is a lovely book in many ways. The photographs are wonderful, a joy, really. But I was expecting more INFORMATION about the spaniel breeds. Instead it's a group of stories about spaniels.They're nice stories, for the most part, but they don't really give you much insight into the breeds.If you just want to be regaled with spaniel tales (forgive the pun but I just couldn't help myself), then I suppose this is the book for you. But if you're looking for more informative reading Amazon has so many much better choices."
5,Great Classic Two,This is a great workout for the boomer generation. It's low impact and strengthens every part of the body.I wish I could find it on DVD.
1,Basement Bargain,"This movie is of horrible quality. It looks like someone used free clipart and a home computer to put together the video. The counting portion is confusing. For example, they will put up the number 4 and say, ""4 cows mooing"" when a picture of one cow is on the screen. The musical instruments portion is narrarated pictures and very boring. I'm still looking for a great math video for my preschooler, but this one is not even close."
1,This is really bad,I bought this when my kids were little. I am going through some things to get rid of and kind of remembered not liking this video. I am watching it again now and it's going through the numbers and when it shows a number it only shows one picture of the item almost every time no matter if it's a 2-10. This seems confusing to me! It's also strange that they put learning numbers with learning time on the same dvd. Numbers might be for 1-2 year olds and time would be for kindergarten or 1st graders. The music portion is very poorly done too. It's all very boring. I don't even dare give my dvd to goodwill. I don't want anyone else to waste money on this.
4,Solid Foundation,"I really found this book to be an interesting read, as it says, it covers a lot of the basic computer science principles.As can be expected from a book that covers such a vast number of topics, it doesn't go into all of them in detail, although a few of them seemed to be quite in-depth.I didn't have a problem with the actual quality of the book(unlike another reviewer), though I definitely think some of the examples could be clearer.I have a good opinion of this book, I think its quite suitable as a university textbook, which is the purpose for which it was written. But I would definitely recommend it for programmers who maybe haven't done any university courses, a book like this will give insight into how things work behind the scene."
2,No Quality Assurance,"This book shows a lot of detailed process, while doing a poor job of explaining it. The first 50 pages of the book have wrong examples on multiple occasions and obvious grammatical errors. There must have been very little quality assurance performed by the publisher of this book. This is sub-standard to use for college level computer science courses. If I were a professor, I would never use a book that shows wrong examples. This is very, very poor workmanship."
5,Awsome camera,If this beauty were a car I'd say it had been owned by a little old lady who only drove it to church. This SRT-202 is in MINT condition as advertised. (It also came with a few extras that weren't) Received it 3 days after purchase. Digitals are OK but this venerable and pristine SRT 202 will join my 201 and we're going out to have some old fashioned fun with film. So glad I was able to spot this the first day it went up for sale and even more glad I didn't hesitate to snap it up.
1,Can't get a repair person,"Bought this fridge because it fit the new kitchen being put in and was a good price. It never quite worked right. The temp would reset occasional and would fluctuate about 10 degree +/-5 from the setting. Finally, after a year and half, it just makes a loud whining noise and doesn't work. BUT, I got an extended warranty! Alas, they called 12 people in the area and none would repair an Avanti fridge. They finally found a person, but we have to pay them ourselves and we will get reimbursed. Provided what the repair charges is reasonable. For the record, Avanti does do extended warranties, they contract them out to a third party. I'm never going near and Avanti again."
5,"Small, simple, functional!","These work well and they are very small to store. At first I wasn't sure why two came together, but I plan to keep one at work and one at home."
3,....thank you Danny,"...I was hesitant in buying this, but I'm so glad I did!""A farewell to the biz.""This one hits close to home."
5,So smooth,"I love this facial cream. It is creamy, but not greasy. Makes your face feel and look soft. I think the only thing that would make it the best face cream ever would be if there were SPF15 in it."
4,This is the first eye cream,"This is the first eye cream I have used. So far no complaints. Wish I had something to compare it to, but I am happy with it."
4,good,"I'm very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.thanks God bless"
2,More cosmetic than repair,"When you read the product description it says that it helps reduce the ""appearance"" of under eye darkness, that must be mostly due to the slight color of the cream which makes it act like a concealer. So don't be fooled it never says that it will actually diminish those dark circles. I have been using this product for over 6 weeks now and have not noticed any lightening of my under eye darkness. Very dissapointed."
4,"Finally, an eye moisturizer that doesn't cake","This eye treatment is great because it doesn't cake under the eye. I use Lancome makeup but the under-eye moisturizer would just cake under my eyes ( I tried Clarin, Arden, etc. too) and they all caked. This one didn't and it is a lot less expensive than the others. I would definitely recommend it.Olay Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream, 0.5 Ounce"
2,It's a lightweight under-eye concealer,"I normally like to buy items that are all natural (no tints). But I wanted to go on the cheaper end to found this item to fight fine lines as well moisturize and protect. This eye cream doesn't absorb as well as I had hoped. Also, it has a little tint, that minimally helps to cover up under eye circles. The downside to this cream is sometimes during warmer weather, it will bunch up and leave behind creases beneath your eyes. To me, it's a light weight under eye concealer (try to use a primer first). All in all, the best product I have used so far is ""Clinique Repairwear Intensive Eye Cream."" I will not give up looking for the best eye cream for the best price. Let me know if you have any suggestions. And the search continues!"
1,Does nothing,"I've almost finished my jar and have not noticed any difference other than the sparkly effect of the silica particles (which I don't care for - they're not ""brightening"" they're more like glittery and can really irritate your eyes if you're not super careful). This cream was a total waste of money and time. It did absolutely nothing for the dark undereye circles I've recently developed and I didn't notice any diminishing effect on the fine lines around my eyes. None at all."
1,Unfortunately a no,I had high hopes for this product considering the company's reputation. Unfortunately my skin did not like it and I developed a rash that turned my skin red and dried it out. So I'm back to using the Nivea eye cream for men.
5,Love this!,"Now, I first must say I am 27 so my fine lines aren't as deeply set as someone twice my age...but they're evident, nonetheless. With that said, I LOVE this cream. It is definitely hydrating and in one week, I was able to see a DRAMATIC difference. The slight darkness is gone and the fine lines have almost disappeared. I would highly recommend this for someone in their late 20s to get a ""head start"" on beating the signs of aging."
2,olay eye cream,am 42 and beginning to develop lines below eyes. Olay's eye creamhas no dramatic effect but cheap enough for anyone to try.
4,Total Effects Eye Transforming cream,I have used only two jars of this cream andI must say that I was completely satisfiedwith the results. I will give it a 4 star rating
3,Good stuff,I honestly have seen a difference since I have been using this product. It has been a month now..Great results.
2,"Contains silica particles, not good for contact lenses","I just bought this eye cream after reading the great reviews about it. I have to admit I am disappointed. The cream has tiny bits of silica, which gives it a sheen to skin when applied. I guess that is supposed to be part of the effect, but I can't see how silica helps improve the skin as it is only a cosmetic fix. This doesn't do anything for night usage. Since I wear contact lenses, it is a disappointment as it can go into my eyes and cause irritation. I was hoping that this product would improve my skin as opposed to being just like ""makeup""."
3,"Not as effective as all the buzz, though not the worst eye cream out there.","Perhaps it was all the hype circulating the internet on just how effective Olay Total Effects Eye Transformation Cream is supposed to be that may be the cause to my ""less than spectacular"" sentiments of it once I actually had the product in hand. However, I must admit, I was a bit disappointed. Yes, the cream is quick to absorb, does not feel oily or leave a shine on your face after applying. It does a good and subtle job of brightening up dark circles under the eye. However, it is not without its shortcomings as well. The moisture level leaves something to be desired. It seems to loose its effect within the first 2-3 hrs after application. Also, if you do not rub the cream in really well, it tends to deposit within the fine lines and creases surrounding the eye, which if left unchecked, can actually make you look aged. Overall, its a decent product, but I don't know if I'd choose to purchase it again."
2,I don't see any difference,I have been using this product for weeks and feel that it does nothing. I see no difference in my skin whatsoever. I really like Olay Products and use several of them but this product adds no value to my daily beauty regimen.
2,More Political than About the Lives of the Monks,"While the book contains brief detail about the work of the Monks and their relationship to the Muslims in the region, the majority of the book seems to focus more on the politics of the region. It jumps around a lot and is somewhat hard to follow."
5,Good supplement to the movie,"The new movie about these monks (Of Gods and Men) is great at giving a feeling for the lives of these Trappist monks, but this book provides a lot of background details; it's particularly good to have the incredibly moving testimony written by the community's leader, Br. Christian, shortly before their death."
4,True Drama and Education,"First I saw the movie, Of Gods and Men. The movie was riveting and lead me to read the book. Because these events happened in our own time, I needed to know the whole story, all the facts. The book detailed the drama but also gave an education about Muslim culture in northern Africa."
5,great book,"Interesting book filled with facts and interesting opinions about an important event, an important country, and an important effort to live together made by Christians and Muslims. Kiser includes a valuable bibliography and time line at the end."
2,the Monks of Tibhirine,"I enjoyed the movie: Of Gods and Men, so I read the book..although informative, it did not have the emotional tug of the super film..very reporterial work.."
5,Awe Inspiring,"This book recounts the heroic faith and works of ""ordinary"" monks living in dangerous times!"
2,Mired in detail,"On the strength of published public reviews, I added this book to my 'must' reading list, and finally ordered it after numerous positive customer reviews.I am sorry that I can't join the enthusiastic chorus. Whatever its merits as a historical reconstruction and analysis of a great tragedy, the book itself never gets off the ground in terms of being a gripping read, and I found myself giving up after both false starts and, alternatively, trying to skim through the book. The mind-numbing detail and philosophical navel-gazing killed any interest I brought to the table.For a good example of my perception of the problem, read the excerpt available in 'search inside the book,' which features page 1 of Chapter 1, Mourning. If you like this page, you'll most likely like the book; if not, look elsewhere."
2,Insalation kit didn't work,The rack is actually pretty good but you have to drill into your tailgate. and the bolts weren't the right length for my truck so I had to order longer ones. Nobody stocked those type bolts where I live. They should work on they're instalation options and charge a little more if they need to. They should make it line up with factoru holes so you don't have to drill into your brand new vehicle. They had a good Idea but then dropped the ball.
5,A genuine classic,"Roman Holiday was Audrey Hepburn's first major role. Gregory Peck, a top tier movie veteran -- who initially was scheduled for solo top billing -- was so impressed with Hepburn's debut performance that he insisted that she be given equal billing with him. This act by Peck turned out to be not only gentlemanly but also very smart when Hepburn won an Academy Award for her performance. Roman Holiday is a genuine classic of the first order and a must see movie for fans of both Peck and Hepburn."
3,Dated but Fun!,"My husband and I chose to see the very dated movie Roman Holiday because we had just returned from two weeks in Italy. We enjoyed seeing the ""old timers"" acting in a silly but enjoyable story and seeing all the places we had just visited."
5,"Grace, Poise and Class all the way","Audre Hepburns debut. This ismy favorite movie of all time. A romantic comedy whose characters have the highest integrity of any film I've ever viewed. If you're not moved by this story and it's portrayal by command performances, then you're not breathing."
4,A classic,"I absolutely love black and white films & Audrey Hepburn. This movie was one of my favorites when I was growing up, even though it was decades older than I was. A true classic film!"
1,WRONG INFORMATION,"I ordered this version because in Amazon it specifies that it has English and Spanish subtitles. Wrong. I had to open it since it only specified English subtitles in the dvd package, and correct, it doesn't have them in Spanish. Now I can't return it since it's open. I needed it that way for my 70 years old uncle, he wanted it for Christmas. I have to look for it again, pay more, and maybe order more dvds to get free shipping.Roman Holiday"
3,A Fun and Silly Movie,"This movie is not the best work for either Hepburn or Peck, but it is fun to see and shows some great scenes of Rome from that time. If you are a fan of either star it is worth owning."
5,Excellent movie,"Audrey Hepburn plays the dazzling Princess Anne in this movie, along with Gregory Peck (the handsome reporter Joe). No wonder Hepburn received an Oscar for her performance! Beautifully elegant, she steals the screen with her looks and grace. The ending may be a little bit upsetting, but if the ending was not the way it was, the movie would have been long-forgotten. It's excellent. I'm an Audrey Hepburn fan all the way around, and for you other Hepburn fans, this is a must see movie!"
4,still a classic,"Love the ability as a prime member to access some old classics. Ran it on my Kindle Fire and on my new hd. Looked good on Kindle Fire but a bit pixelated on hd, still loved it."
5,Great,"This is a timeless movie. A bit old fashioned but a nice story and good acting. Audrey Hepburn's first, I think"
5,Awesome,"Great movie. Love AH. Sweet love story, honorable behavior, very old school. Wish there were more movies like this one."
4,Good and Clean,I like to watch old movies. They usually have a good plot and the language is clea. I get tired of watching movies that the language is so foul that it ruis a movie. Movies can bee good without the f word and even the gd word. Also there is too much violence in movies nowadays.
5,Good film,I really like this classic. Light hearted from beginning to end. The lead female character is very pretty too hahah.
5,Needless to say: all time classic,"~I think there is really no need to introduce or praise this movie. History will tell (has already told) that it is one of the classic in the movie industry that deserves to be collected and viewed again and again. Therefore a superb DVD transfer is on demand. This collector's edition did a great job on remastering the original film to DVD format - crystal clear picture with almost all scratches and noises removed. Play it in your DVD player, you won't believe that you are watching and hearing an~~ age old movie. Both picture and sound are superbly transfered plus all the extra features - this is the best money you can spend on a DVD with the contents for generations to enjoy.~"
5,Roman holiday,This movie is truly a classic. Audrey hepburn and gregory peck at their ffinest. If you like classic romantic movies look no further. They sure dont make them like they used to!
4,Classic Romance,"This film's about 60 years old, but is interesting for several reasons. It shows what Rome was like at that time, and it succeeds without any illicit sexual activity. Hepburn is uniquely appealing."
5,We've loved Audrey ever since,"The world was introduced to Audrey Hepburn with this exceptional romantic comedy, and it's been a love affair between star and audience ever since. Gregory Peck plays a reporter working for an American newspaper in Rome who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime when a visiting princess (Hepburn) goes for a spree in the middle of the night. Thinking herself incognita, she eventually gives in to the sedative she was given back at the palace and in a drugged stupor ends up in his taxicab. The next day he shows her around the city, pretending to not to know who she is until he can get back to his typewriter and publish the story that will make him world famous. Unfortunately, a problem develops: he really begins to like her. William Wyler's direction is spiffy, Rome hasn't looked this good in ages, and Hepburn's fresh charm and adorable demeanor are simply to die for. A real classic!"
3,great relationship,"I did not receive my DVD on time, but the seller was great; once I contacted him, he sent the DVD and reimbursed my purchase. Thanks."
3,"Audry is beautiful, but not as good as I hoped.","I thought the role Peck played was a jerk.As I was watching this movie, I remembered what Eliza from ""My Fair Lady,"" said: ""The difference between a lady and a flower girl is not the way she behaves, but the way she is treated.""In my opinion, Roman Holiday presents a contrasting moral view to the above quote from Eliza (i.e. it's who she is that get the right treatment.)"
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"Don't waste your time or money on this crummy little program. Here are some of its many shortcomings: 1. There are NO instructions, and NO HELP FILES, (your only recourse is to navigate the hard-to-use Veritas web site) 2. It does not remember what files you backed-up, so you have to go through the laborious process of selecting what files to back-up EACH TIME you use the program), 3. There is no way to back-up only those files that have recently changed (incremental); this makes it impractical to use as a daily backup. 4. You have no control over compression, 5. Technical Support at Veritas is pay-as-you-go. 6. There is no way to display what files you have backed-up. This program makes clunky old Microsoft Backup look like a jewel."
4,"Simple, but easy.",I liked the way it installed on Windows ME. It seemed to put my files on the cd so it is easy to backup when needed.
4,Great artist,"This CD is great. The other reviewers have it right. Read their reviews for more detail on the CDs content. Many of the cuts on this CD (and Mouneissa, get that also!) fully deserve 5 stars.Actually, I'm writing this review in hopes of bringing more attention to Rokia and her amazing musicians. If you get a chance to see them live, do not miss it. The band is one of the most exciting, talented, mesmerizing acts to come out of Africa.The ngoni players are two of the most talented on the planet. Having the two together, with their interplay and range, is as good as it gets."
5,Another wonderful HABA toy,"Although this was purchased for our 8 month old, kids of all ages (adults too) find this toy to be very interesting. It's a fabulous teething toy as well as offering manipulative activity.Another favorite HABA toy for this age are the Discovery Blocks!"
3,Was a favorite... until she broke teeth!,"My daughter loved this toy from 6 months on. I often gave it to her in the car if she was fussy, as I did today. However, today I was shocked to see her mouth full of the blue stain when I got her out of the carseat!!! Her newly errupted sharp little tooth scraped stain off of the toy. Thank goodness it is non-toxic-- but clearly not safe as a teether, as it is marketed."
5,Fun for the Whole Family,"This is a lovely wooden alternative to those rubber Vegas-style musical rattle teething rings (which we also have, but which bug the heck out of me). The triangles can be manipulated on the elastic, but there is just enough resistance so it's very satisfying to turn them this way and that. It does not occupy my toddler as long as things that make more noise, but she does like to make it into a bracelet and chew on it. It is one of those toys that seems to interest adults as well.The paint is stained on there and unlike the paint on some other wooden toys she has, it has not chipped despite her attempts to bang it on the hardest surfaces indoors and out.It seemed expensive for the size, but I would buy it again."
3,Nice but too small...,"I just bought this for my son, he is little behind on motor skills (premmie and sick) I always try to buy simple toys that might help him with his delays, the toy overal is nice, is well build..the only issue that I have is TOO SMALL, babies need bigger items to grab etc...and for the price..I think is also overpriced..I dont know..It would be PERFECT if bigger."
4,Simple Yet Fun,My 8 month old daughter likes to teethe on this toy. She hasn't figured out how to manipulate it into different shapes / patterns yet. My husband and I have probably played with it more than her. I think the interest will come with age. It is not made in China so we feel a little better about it being used as a teether.
3,nice toy but chips easily,"I only buy wooden toys or other natural materials. I love Haba and this toy is really a very entertaining one. The triangles can be manipulated in many different ways, the toy is very small so fits in diaper bags easily, and finally, because it makes no noise, is great for plane rides or travel in general.All the great things aside, I am quite disappointed that this toy chipped within weeks of use. I am very careful and never let this toy come in contact with water, except for the expected mouthing by the baby. I don't feel comfortable with the idea of my boy ingesting the supposedly non-toxic paint. I would go for toys that are unfinished or stained, rather than painted."
4,Appealing to a wide range,"This is so simple yet so clever. It was given to a 1 yr old as a birthday gift and a number of adults there were checking it out and ""playing"" with it. So don't know about durability yet. No batteries and no parts to lose whats not to like?"
2,Paint comes off,"This toy has been in our home for only a couple of months and after minimal play (because our then 7 month old was never very interested in it), the blue paint is already coming off. We stopped letting our baby play with the toy because our 3 year old niece got her finger stuck in it and started crying hysterically within 1 minute of starting to play with it."
3,Trix Toy,Bought this toy for christmas for my one year old son. He likes it but I think is a little old now for this particular toy. I also would have liked it to be much bigger than it actually is. The whole toy will fit in an adults palm. Interesting toy over all. Just wouldn't recommend it for children over one.
2,Dissapointed with song length,"I love trance music especially with haunting female voices. This cd is chock full of that. But I am really dissapointed with the song lengths, I like my trance songs to last a minimum of 6 minutes, 8 minutes being better. But on this cd, most of the songs are under 4 minutes!! So just as I am starting to really get into a song, it's over. I feel like this is more like a sample cd then a real one. I don't think I will buy Best of Trance cd's again."
2,"Pop candy, lack of creativity and depth","The short lenghts of the tracks, the silly lyrics, the oversymplified melodic hooks. It is just a bunch of easy NRJ radio recepies. This is not Trance, it is pop electronica for teenagers. I expect Trance to take my hand and make me dream, take me somewhere. This cd just bores me with its over-used tracks with easy remixes. I was expecting fruit nectar and I end up with diluted kool-aid. Just leave it for the kids, it is still a good alternative for Jessica Simpson :-)"
1,Ick,"Just like the other two, this feeds the MTV generation their trance through a straw. Featuring songs as much as two years old, this has managed to commercialize the trance scene just a little bit more. The few decent tracks are interspersed with absolute garbage. Avoid this mix at all costs"
2,cute and empty,"A cute story of a young woman realizing that love does not come in a package but is nurtured and grown through the acts of acceptance and facing the reality... An easy, quick afternoon read when you really want to relax and let your brain rest :)Victoria Evangelina"
2,I Couldn't Finish This Book,"I loathed the main character, maybe because she reminded me too much of people I have actually worked with in the corporate world. I thought she was obnoxious and self-absorbed, and by the middle of the book I had no interest in how it would end."
3,Although I love happy endings,"I found that I only read to the end because I wanted to read the obvious happy ending. Already stated is the unecessary reference to other authors which displeased me. In addition, the use of the word pregnant was drained, and I didn't end the book with much respect for the Lane. However, I was happy that she found her M&M. Other than that it was sort of weak."
1,Can I give it a ZERO ! ?,"Very low quality. Candy arrived in a plain, transparent plastic bag with no markings except stock number. No country of origin, no brand name, no ingredient list, no description, no dates, nothing ! The black licorice (I really doubt it is licorice) tasted disgusting with an after taste that lasted for an hour. The colored pieces were all smeared with the black licorice making the entire mess very unappealing looking. The black pieces were also stuck together in clumps. I've had good licorice and bad - this is the worse I've ever had the misfortune of trying. It was supposed to be Bassett's brand, a decent product, I can't believe it really is. Also, another reviewer mentioned it looked like floor sweepings, I think they are right.One final question: How can a 5 lb bag of candy have a shipping weight of 4.6 lbs ?"
5,Fresh and Tasty,"Our Allsorts licorice arrived quickly - in time for a birthday surprise! It's hard to find this great licorice anywhere locally, and when you do, it's very expensive. We were delighted with the price, service and most of all - taste!"
4,They made a great effort,"Shipping very poor, charged 11 dollars to ship and threw in a USPS cardboard envelope not a box which ruptured by the time it got to me. Had to throw it all away. I was very disappointed in the vendor as well as Amazon for promoting them. I gave it one star because the product actually did arrive. I shop a lot at Amazon and I hope they pressure these people to ship better , especially when charging outrageous shipping prices. My recommendation is avoid these people, good product, VERY BAD SHIPPING!!!!!!I wrote this review, and I wish to change it to 4 stars. This company replaced damaged product without my asking, in fact I said they didn't have to because someone signed for the original damaged product and that is our fault . To do this just to make a customer happy really says a lot of good things about this company. Shipping still needs a little work, but better this time. Thank you very much, msbcontinua"
1,How can they sell this crap,"Just received my 5lb package of licorice allsorts. It looked like it had been in a shop window for years. The candy was hard and it was discolored. This was not what I expected from Amazon. I have had excellent results from Amazon, but that was with books, perhaps things are not that great in the groceries department. I will not order from Cherryfield Candy Inc.ever again.I was extremely disappointed with the product.Licorice Allsorts [5LB Bag]"
1,not fresh,"this licorice was not as fresh as they said and I don't think i would buy this again, nor would i recommend this product to my friends or family"
1,"old, sugarified, tasteless","old, sugarified, tasteless sums up this product. it came in a double plastic bag and gave the connotation that there was a mountain of licorice allsorts somewhere and this was the bottom, shoveled up and sent to poor unsuspecting me. perhaps i can turn this into some garden art, or wait till Halloween and give them away; the time couldn't effect the flavor any more"
3,My favorite candy,I ordered this because I love the allstate and it hard I find them. The product came in an open bag and was not real fresh. Not horrible but was not as fresh as I would expect. The pricing was good otherwise.
2,A little Stale!?,"I was diappointed by this product for two reasons. First, it was kind of stale, not as fresh as the individual packages. Second, and I may be wrong, but it didn't seem like it was the same quality as the regular Bassett's!? I'll eat it, but I will buy the smaller packages next time."
2,dissappointing,This stuff isn't very good. It's all sweet with little distinctive flavor. It has a grainy texture. The product comes in unsealed bags. I'm gagging as I'm writing this.
1,No Way!,This was in no way the Bassetts All Sorts I was lead to believe I was ordering. Tastes nothing like the Bassetts we are use to. Would NEVER order it again.
2,Not what I expected!,"I had my own opinion about what I would like in this product, based of product we had in the past. Unfortunately this product does not match the taste experience we had in the past---We will keep looking for our past experience!"
4,My son loves it,"I ordered this item for my son to take to school, and it has everything we need. The space, the colors and designs and the water bottle. It's exactly what we expected when we ordered it."
2,Two boys' review: A playset that plays more like an accessory,"Pleased with our first playset purchase --Mattel Matchbox 360 Pop-Up Pirate Island(see my review) -- we bought the Ratatouille Kitchen Chaos Playset.So, why the low ratings for Ratatouille?1. The playset doesn't offer much to do. There aren't many accessories, certainly not enough to pretend cooking, which we thought was the point of a kitchen playset. You get a couple pots and ladles but nothing to put inside the pots.2. The playset needs to include more characters. You get Remy the rat. That's it. So, you playtime consists of Remy wandering around an empty kitchen (no food) and nobody else around.A playset should include enough items to make it fun by itself. This is actually a Ratatoille accessory. If you own a lot of the other movie-related toys, you'll enjoy this toy more."
5,An invaluble resource,"This book has TONS of information on an enormous range of foods. It lists and describes varieties, health benefits/myths/concerns, nutritional information, history, and serving suggestions for everything from apples and asparagus to flour and sweeteners. I bought pasilla peppers at farmer's market today, and looked them up to see how they compared to anaheims in terms of flavor and heat. It's a very convenient resource.I was recently diagnosed with type I diabetes, and this book has become absolutely essential to me. I can look up how many calories are in an avocado and how many carbohydrates are in a persimmon. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to control their diet, or is just curious about their food."
5,Wellness Foods A to Z,One of the best and most complete plainly worded explanations for any heathly eating and thoughful person-- although the volume is several years old (2002). It has been the first book I go to when puzzled about practically any food and its nuitrition.
1,"Complete lie and waste of money. We received a package of tiny bits of ginger, NOT a whole piece of ginger root!!! SCAM!","Complete lie and waste of money. We received a package of tiny bits of ginger, NOT a whole piece of ginger root!!! It's a complete SCAM and waste of money!!!"
3,Experimental Barker,"This is early early Barker, at his most experimental. These two films are short and silent with a modern score overlaid. Transfers are rough, and scratchy, but that may be deliberate. If you've seen the AFI-Lynch shorts you know the mood of these pieces. I cannot make a general recomendation but for those of us with an unhealthy interest in Clive's work its a decent investment. Be warned though Redemption Video has an over-long and somewhat silly pre-movie video sequence that is basically an ad for their other releases."
3,For the serious Clive Barker fan only,"I love his work, but I found this a bit hard to get through. It's all images, no text or dialogue (save for the interviews), and though it is visually compelling, it may not be appealing to those who don't like surrealistic art flicks. The Forbidden is beautiful to see, as is Salome...very different from what we're used to. The bizarro introduction put forth by Redemption Video is pure tripe; fast foward through it."
3,Enter the deep dark trenches of young Clive Barker's mind.,"Once you get past the labels bizarre introduction, this is a look at 2 of Clive Barker's first amateur movies. Salome is an interpretation of an Oscar Wilde play. The Forbidden is an interpretation of the Faust legend and looks to be an inspiration for Hellraiser. A must see for Barker fans!"
3,hmmmmmm... stimulated - make that simulated SNUFF....,Well Ladies and Germs! This one's for the ole man in da sky ... an odd but not disappointing first vision of Mr. Barker's sm and then some world. Salome counterpoints Nazimova's version quite cutely - now - the Forbidden? Reminds so much of other student efforts .......Vaguely amateur - but piquant - so we must applaud?
2,For Clive Barker completists,"If you're a maniacal fan of the Hellraiser series, you may find these two short films interesting for historical reasons, since they include some of the actors and themes that turn up in Barker's more professional later films. There are also a couple of interviews which enlighten us (sort of) on what the films are supposed to be about! The adjective ""murky"" (in more ways than one) best describes these fuzzy 8-mm efforts. Not being, I confess, a big Hellraiser fan, I found my primary emotion to be not horror but boredom."
4,Enjoyed This DvD,"I enjoyed seeing some of Clive Barker's early work. It shows where he received some of his ideas, and the extras help to verify this."
2,"not at all related to ""Candyman""","The opening credits in the film ""Candyman"" state that it is based on ""The Forbidden"" by Clive Barker.Only later did I learn that it was a short story and not a film by Barker that the movie ""Candyman"" was based on."
4,Want to show off your legs?,"I hope so, because these are quite short and have a tendency to ride up with movement. With that being said, I would still definitely recommend them because they're made of nice fabric & quality. I anticipate wearing these comfortable shorts for many years to come!"
5,Great History Lesson,"This is a book that my mom read to me when I was a kid and I have read to my kids and we have all thouroughly enjoyed. Unlike most books about historical figures, the Sower Series includes the faith that was so very important to each and every one of the people written about. What a truly awesome way to show our kids the real history of our Nation. One Nation, Under God!"
3,Magnets,"Handling and positioning the magnets next to another is kind of difficult, for they attract each other. It's very hard to keep them into place without attraction from the opposite near it."
1,rip off,I bought a CARS hotwheel at Target for $3.99. I then ordered this one thinking it was a larger car because it costs so much! After 6 days and 29.99 a hot wheel car was delivered to me!!! This is the worst experience with Amazon I have ever had - it seems like when I use their partners there's always a problem. What a RIP OFF!
1,OUTRAGEOUS PRICE,"Nothing wrong with the actual product -- the car -- or any of the others in the series of cars from the movie. BUT the price is outrageously high. You can find this at Target or a kids toy store for something in the neighborhood of $4 (yes, four dollars). So what makes these thieves (""Doodle Duds"") think they can hose people for SIX times that price?!"
4,Concealed Carry A Practical Guide,Concealed Carry A Practical GuideThis book is filled with useful information for anyone considering concealed carry. It is easy to read and quickly gets to the point. Pretty much covers all of the subject areas including the philosophy of carrying a concealed weapon.I would recommend it.J.S. So-Cal
3,Camera Accessories not all there,I received the two lenses and two tripods and nothing even closely related to a lens cleaning kit.I was a little disapointed especially when the tripods can't even support the camera that I bought it for. I Have no idea what I will do with two of them.KR Mitchell
2,Nice preformance,"Nice record, witty lyrics, sorta melodic but poorly mastered. Every track is clipped on the CD. Over there last few years the music industry has been pushing hot levels on the cds, apparently somebody in the AR dept decided louder is better. This one pushes the loudness envelope to the point of distortion. Listerer fatige sets in by the time you get to the 3rd track. It's a real shame because this is a nice CD"
2,Not knowing what to do about these bunyons,"Alright, not sure where to start here with this album. There are so many things that this band could have done better. First off, its overly produced for its style. Second off, far too much compression for my liking. Thirdly, its tiring for the ears to listen to. Now for the good stuff... This album has some very catchy moments, the lyrics however are a bit hammy. So all in all an interesting album, with interesting ideas/concepts...just not pulled off that great."
2,Potential is there.....,"I admit i was quite excited about this band after i heard ""Jerk it out,"" but the truth is that other than this and a few other songs there isn't much in this album or in the Caesars. For instance, there's something definitely wrong when a band puts the same song in two different albums. And the song that just happens to appear more than once, is ""Jerk it Out."" The song is very catchy, but I'd like to hear more than just a few good songs from an album. They definitely have the potential, but they're just not quite there yet."
3,Good Adaptation of an Average Book,"""Almuric"" was Robert E. Howard's only true novel, yet it is in many ways one of his lesser works. It's very derivative of Edgar Rice Burroughs and his ""John Carter of Mars"" series.That being said, no one more faithfully adapts REH's work than Roy Thomas, and Tim Conrad is a top notch illustrator. If your interests run to sci fi/fantasy graphic novels, this is a book you'll want to add to your collection. Just be forewarned: if you love REH's Conan, you may not find this to be up the level of the Conan tales."
5,Classic Alan Watts lecture extracts,"This is pulled from various lectures Alan gave over a course of 10 years or more I think, but well edited to include important areas of Watts teaching. If you resonate with his style of presenting the truth this is a worthwhile aquisition."
3,Would be good for larger kitchens and bathrooms: not so good for smaller ones,"I like Debbie Travis's style, but the homeowner faced with a kitchen smaller than about 15x15 or a bathroom smaller than 8x10 might find the design ideas difficult to incorporate into his or her own home. As the owner of a tract home with a (very typical for this city) 4x6 bathroom and a 9x10 kitchen, I didn't find much of use."
2,Quite Disappointed,"This book is a primer on the subject of awareness.For a more intense study, try ""Awareness: The Key to Living in Balance (Insights for a New Way of Living)"" or ""Consciousness Is All: Now Life Is Completely New""."
4,Alpine type-s 6x9,"I had these in the back of my sisters car which i drove for a year, they were great speakers but not outstanding. Since I knew I wasnt keeping the car this is why I put in these speakers. They do sound great for basicly all music, strong mid and bass tones. I do recomend them but i now that i have my own car I am getting the Type-R 6 1/2 upfront and a Type-R 10inch sub.Over all a great speaker. Very nice sound clean and crisp. I did have the ones with the 1 inch tweeter and im sure it made a small differance but nothing noticeable.Hope this helps."
3,"It's ok, but...","...it's average. There is far better out there. Nice effort, not leveling any great criticism on this, just be aware this is not by any means the top of the music genre, that is, Zimbabwean based marimba bands i.e. Dumi inspired. The late great Dumi had one true great band, his first, Dumi and The Minanzi Marimba Ensemble."
2,I real challenge to read!,"Sophie was a very irresponsible child. She was trying to be responsible in the beginning of the book but as you read farther into it she chose to make choices that weren't in her best interests. She was taking care of more than herself throughout the entire book but many times she didn't show us that. I believe that it shows us again that teenagers are not responsible enough to be parents. I also found that this book was a challenge to read. I was often having to turn the page back to see if I had missed something, only to find out that I didn't and the plot had just changed. I didn't like that. The one thing that I did like was how she felt equal with everyone, not more superior than another race."
2,More self-indulgence,"What an exercise in self-indulgence. I am so tired of reading the writing of people who ""had it all"" (and can't wait to tell everyone) - led a glamorous life, extremely good-looking, a body to die for, a sex life to rival that of a rabbit, courted and wanted by everyone, etc., etc., etc...and then complain about how unhappy they were - page after page. Poor thing.Give me your (past) life for just 15 minutes, and you would NEVER hear a peep of complaint out of me. 200+ pages of ""I had it all, but woe is me"" is too much."
4,very candid memoir,"I will say this about the book. The author has an entertainingstyle, and he does give us somewhat of a personal glimpseinto thelife of the rich and famous. He most certainly has a long list of names. That the author's life seemed a wasteland of superficialvalues, encounters and self hatred was a bit on the depressing side. But then, he now claims he is where he wants to be, even though we are not quite certain how he got there.Confusing? Thats pretty much what the book was all about."
3,Enough already,"My dad of all people recommended this book to me, telling me it was absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately, reading page after page of stories about someone who is smarter, more talented, and better looking than anyone else around doesn't fascinate me... it does help me go to sleep a little faster at night though."
4,"Great read, but a little flat at the end.","A fascinating book, which neither idolized Black Bart, or demonizes him either. Hoeper has really done his research. I never knew the full story about Black Bart before. This story fills in lots of the gaps that people don't know.The only complaint I had was that at the end, Hoeper's ""new evidence"" that Black Bart died in Nevada is nothing more than a mild... ""It might have been him."" I expected some evidence. To this day, nobody REALLY knows what happened to Bart after he got out of prison.Other than a mild letdown at the end, I still HIGHLY reccommend this book. A fascinating story of one of the Old West's most ""larger than life"" characters."
5,Darkness falls is a WINNER,"As a parent of high school age kids, I could relate closely to the adolescent and school issues this book examines. In fact, it deals with such a broad selection of family and personal issues, there's something here that will touch almost everyone. I felt that parts of the story were written about me and I believe that most readers will experience this same feeling. The events are very troubling and this book puts you on the spot, to deal with them and where we're going as a society.Meals served up by Del Vecchio (I think this is his 4th book) are not fast food. But, when you get up from the table, you feel full, satisfied and as if you've just experienced a new cuisine. Sticking with the metaphor, the story repeats on you. The issues and choices will continue to haunt you for a long time."
2,This is funny...?!,"With a market crash just behind us,this couldn't have come out at a worse time.Several major religions have programs of foodstorage for emergencies.Making fun of human fears isn't a real good thing;having lived through the bomb shelter era of the 50'sI have to say that atomic war isn't something that is easy forpeople to be comfortable with.There are cities all over America with 1950'sbomb shelters.I'm sure this fellow thought this was comedy, but it is justpoor taste? The Bush administrationlike the Eisenhower one before has feed on our fears,but they are real fears that we have to deal with."
5,Informative on all levels from collector to artist,"This film will be one of the most beautiful and informative things in the library! I have been a ceramic artist for 20 years and still learned a trick or two here about one of the most (physically) challenging techniques of ceramic production, wood firing! The narratives were great, the steps presented in logical order. Sound quality was good and clear, filming techniques completely professional. Worthy of a TV spot, I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves pottery. I bought it to show my high school pottery class."
1,Rattlebone Rock book,"I was not happy with this product. It came much later than the delivery date in a worn out package that looked like it had been run over on a highway. The book was bent, torn, and had all this white gook on the cover. I guess that is ""good"" condition, I'd hate to see what the next step down would be! Will not order from this person again.However, the content of the book itself is adorable and I can't wait to use it in my classroom for Halloween next year!"
5,Don't Miss This Book,"Hands-down, this is the absolute best Halloween book for young children. We bought this when it first came out in 1997, and it still has an honored spot on our shelves. Every year, we pull it out and revel in the fanciful pictures, catchy rhymes, and joy of the season.We started reading this when my son was only a few months old, and now that he's almost 9, it's still a favorite -- and our younger two kids love it just as much. Don't miss this book!"
3,ok if you have short shelves,I guess this produt would work better if I only have one shelf. I have a double shelf and it does not go back far enough.
4,In my constant quest to get organized...,...these dividers have been great. I'm using them now to keep groups of handbags separated so that I can see them all and get to them easily; I have 3 handbags between every two dividers. I have additional dividers I plan to use to keep my husband's stacks of sweaters from tipping over on the closet shelf.
1,Don't buy this!,"As a big fan of Juan Gabriel i ordered this dvd. The delivery was more than good but i was shocked when i put this dvd on. Lots, and lots of errors. It must have bin een bad copy from vhs tape. The picture quality is really horrible also the sound.Of course 5 dollar is not a lot of money but it's even to much for this piece of s...They never should have brought this kind of copy on the market, it's a big shame!I am foreced to give this dvd a star but even this one star is too much for it!!!!"
3,OS9 procedure,"If you are using OS9 you will encounter the following problem after installing the included Adobe Type Manager software: ""System error type 119."" Canon and Adobe are aware of this and the fix is as easy as going to adobe and downloading ""Adobe Tpye Manager 4.5.2 Macintosh version"" (NOT the deluxe version). At some time in the near future Canon will update the included software, but until then there is no clue about how to solve this problem in the box."
4,An all-around decent unit for home and SOHO.,"I used a MultiPass C635 for a few years with my iMac Rev. A, and other than a few hiccups in the initial driver release, which were promptly fixed in Canon's next release, the unit was very good to me for scanning, printing, and faxing. Also comes bundled with PhotoDeluxe, a very good photo editor."
5,Great Album,"This second album by Mary Bergin includes a few of the songs from her old one, but don't let that off put you. It is very enjoyable and even the old tunes are a bit different."
1,quite a disappointment,don't let this cd influence your opinion of grimskunk; they can do much better. try Meltdown or Fieldtrip.
1,NOT GOOD QUALITY,"Very poor quality. This machine only worked properly for approx. 2 weeks. The machine will still answer calls, play outgoing & incoming messages, but both the outgoing and incoming messages are speeded up causing extreme distortion."
3,It's OK,"Nothing special. Erasing message is a pain and everytime the power goes out or a power surge, I have to redo my message. Bottom line- It's inexpensive and it works."
1,"Cheap price, cheap product.",It's dead after two months of use. Kind of glad it died because now I have an excuse to buy a decent answering machine.
5,Principles and Practice of Forensic Psychiatry,"Many requests for information about how to obtain this book have been sent to the editor. Most problems related to the fact that the publisher of the First Printing no longer owns the rights to the book. The current publisher of the Second Printing (i.e. a second printing of the First Edition) of this book is Edward Arnold Publishers, based in London, Enlgand. The date of the Second Printing is 1998. Books from Edward Arnold Publishers are distributed in the USA by Oxford University Press, located in New York, N.Y. Other persons have inquired when the next completely new Second Edition will be available. The editor is working hard on this project, but the new book will not be available for several years, i.e. probably in 2003."
1,Audacity of Depression,"This man has the audacity to prey on our dreams and desires. 1 year into his presidency do we have hope ? Has anything he has promised been even remotely been discussed, let alone accomplished. You are just a Uncle Tom to your corporate Wall Street masters, Mr O. Don't bring your whitey agenda any where near my consciousness."
1,Politics,And FINALLY the Most Damning one of ALL of his statements!!!!!From Audacity of Hope:'I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.'
4,"Prompt, in condition as promised","Living on an outer island of Hawaii, often ordered merchandise is slow to get here, however, the book arrived promptly and in promised condition. Would do biz again."
4,Obama the man,This was a very interesting read. Obama really explained life the behind politics making him seem like a really likable man. He answered questions broad enough to where you could see the difficulties in making some tough decisions while narrow enough you could see his stance. I know that I would vote for him to be the next president.
4,Barack-What a wonderful book!!--There is nothing wrong with HOPE!,"I really enjoyed this book. I think my view of Barack was indifferent until I read his book. He an idealist, a populist (like Lou Dobbs), a man for the people. I think he is very sincere. The fact that he still has hope and can articulate that 'HOPE' is refreshing. Whether you're a Republican or Democratic-Barack is breath of fresh air. I don't know if he can win the Presidency, but he's got a good chance. Read the book and judge for yourself."
2,THE OBAMA DECEPTION!,"This book does not offer anything new about Obama or his political views. If you support Obama, then you will enjoy the book and continue to support him.On another note, he talks about the centralization of the American Political System, which falls in line with the continued centralization of power in America. What Obama fails to realize about centralized power is that it (almost always) equals tyranny.When reading this book, you almost get the sense that Obama was certain he would be the next president of the United States. In my first book titled ""The Conspiracy Fraud"", I predicted that Obama would win the presidency. It was an easy guess because the globalist needed a dramatic ""face-lift"".Jose M. PaulinoAuthor of ""The War on Terror Fraud"""
5,YES WE CAN!!!,Everyone Hates a Ball Hog but they All Love a Scorer: The Complete Guide to Scoring Points on and off the Basketball CourtGOD BLESS AMERICA AND OUR PRESIDENT!!!
3,Obama's world - a politician who can bridge the gap?,"Mr Obama presents a picture of himself as a solid, yet practical, liberal who is willing to ""understand the other side"". As a relative newcomer to the political scene, that may still be true.I missed his coming-out speech at the Democrat convention since I don't generally watch convention coverage - it's pretty pointless, as are all political ""debates"".My take? He seems like a ""real"" person. If he conveys this in his campaigning, he can go far (as if he hasn't already).Politicians seem to crank out the books to give their candidacy legitimacy. I doubt that it's worth their time though. The VAST MAJORITY of Americans never read books after they get out of school, and those FEW that will read a book like this are already pretty set in their political views."
1,"Fun message, but shallow vision for real progress","I read the book after buying it at a book signing. It was my second Obama book. It was very readable, entertaining and people-pleasing. I don't think his messages have much to say to seniors or baby-boomers. He should be a youth counselor and mentor, not president.After his book signing, as I waited for my ride home, I watched for an hour as people met Mr. Obama to get their book signed. With ""young"" people under 40-ish, he was animated, smiling, pouring on the charm. With folks over 40-ish, he appeared bored and had nothing much to say to them. Watch it on c-span sometime and see what you think. It was incredibly obvious and made me read the book even more closely to see what his message is. I was not ultimately left with much of an impression that he can lead our country and represent the future."
2,New?,"Old time European progressive politics, engagingly packaged. Wins voters, but will not solve real American problems. Doesn't even solve European problems--class warfare, high unemployment, mediocre education, mediocre health care. These solutions will however take your money, make it impossible for you to buy anything good privately, and create a solid class of dependent voters for Obama.Do you really think that he will cut taxes on 95%, increase them only on 5%, and pay for everything! We better have an awful lot more rich people reporting their income every year! Somehow, this sounds as great as the AMT, designed by democrats to soak the rich, and now...But that's OK. Obama will be there with a check when you need it."
1,"A Poorly Written, Failed Attempt at Insight","Barack Hussein Obama's latest book ""The Audacity of Hope"" is a failed attempt at writing. In this book, Barack Hussein Obama claims that we need to ""reclaim"" the American dream. Yet all around us Americans are achieving their dreams. More Americans own homes than ever before and the economy is stronger than it ever has been. There hasn't been a terrorist attack on American soil in years, and Iraq is a free Democracy when just a few short years ago Iraqis were being gassed by the terrorist Saddam.Clearly we don't need to ""reclaim"" something that we already have. We are living the American dream thanks to pro-freedom policies enacted by great presidents like George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Now is a great time to be an American, and a poor time to be selling Americans lies about how miserable things are. Sorry Barack Hussein Obama, I don't need to reclaim the American dream - I'm already living the American dream."
1,"The title should just be ""The Audacity""... period","Good lord what an arrogant self-absorbed narcissist. I gave this a fair shot and can't believe what I read. I suggest you read this book simply to ""know-your-enemy."" And get it from the library. Don't give this worm another penny."
5,Mr President Obama,"I havent read this book but I have listened to the audiobook which to me is much better because Barack is the one narrating his own book with his voice. Alot of valid points stated and well vell open minded person. I wont get into a whole detail since alot people placed their own positive opinions, but you dont really need to read theirs if you already like the candidate. Barack is my hero!"
5,He earned my respect,"I have such respect for Obama's intelligence and insight.In this book, he discusses his priorities and his positions on many issues. What I like most is that he avoids ridiculing other points of view. In fact, he acknowledges the best of their positions, then goes on to explain his own ideas.For example, Obama is pro-choice. But instead of painting pro-lifers as neanderthals who want to enslave women, he sees that many are principled people who care deeply. That, in turn, gives his decision to value reproductive freedom more weight.This is the kind of thinker and communicator I'd like to have leading our country."
1,Audacity of Boredom,I was so disappointed in this book. I was prepared to be wowed and instead I was bored. The pedantic style and monotone narrative was a big turn off for me.
5,Very impressive book,I felt that the author presented a clear view of his political philosophy along with his basis for his beliefs from personal and historical examples. The writing was clear and direct. I became convinced that Senator Obama has staked out a legitimate claim to be considered a candidate for the Presidency of the US.
5,The Audacity of Hope,"To be brief, the vision and energy that shines through Borack Obama's book has inspired me to get re-involved in a political process that has essentially shortchanged the American public since FDR."
1,I couldn't bear to finish this book,"I was hoping to find reason to vote for Senator Obama, and made a game try to get through the book. What made it so hard to read? Misconstrued, incomplete ideas wrapped in ""feelings""? I felt better when I put the book in the bottom of my trash barrel to save others from it. But I felt worse when I worried that it might appeal to them."
1,It's the Content I don't like,I can't disagree with Barack Obama more on MANY subjects. I don't understand his pride in community organizing.It's not really a position a lawyer would want. Makes you wonder why he school documents are sealed.
1,political self-promotion,"why pay to read of his moral superiority? obama tellsus every day on the nightly news . now, if the book had chapters on, say, how to get slumlords to finance your house, or how to sabotage universal health care, or how to stop nuclear regulation (and make exelon your leading campaign contributor) then it would be worth buying ."
2,Political Nonsense,"Obama recognises quite rightly that America is divided but then he goes on to say that he is the answer to the problem. A person, any person, who regards himself as the center around which a society should revolve is a person of so base in morals that he will soon become dangerous. In assigning himself the role of Political Saviour, he exalts himself above everyone else. This is fatal!"
1,I wish everyone read this..,If the rest of the United States had read this book there is no way he would have been the Democratic nominee. His twisted views of how America is 'broken' are just not spoken enough!
2,"All Style, very little substance","Obama's book, is much like his political career, all style no substance. Look, I voted for Kerry in 2004-would vote for him again in 2008-but Obama just turns me off. I bought this book, thinking that it would change my opinion, but he seems much more like a ""life-coach"" and less like a Presidential candidate."
1,More Democrat Trash,The liberals strike again! This book does nothing but attack the Republican and promote the socialist agenda. The last thing America needs is another big government pig like Obama or Hillary. GOP in 2008!
1,4 years later and Hope is what has been missing.,"So, I figured it would be a good time read this book and see if the audacity was really what we would embrace. It is not and I here to say that hope was more of a dream if you take a view of this book for the future and a driver toward that future. Perhaps, that is unfair in the text itself, but this was what was used as a major political platform. I say in theory is it nice left ideal, but in practice as with communism or social democracy, is a failure. I cannot recommend this book or its content."
1,"Don't buy this book to find out what he will do as president, find a different book","I bought this book to see what he thought and what he would do as president. I got nothing. On top of it, it was a serious waste of time to read the book since there is no information in the book. Buy a different book to make your decision."
1,Inspired by the demented ravings of his pastor,"""The Audacity of Hope"" was inspired by Obama's pastor Jeremiah Wright, pastor of Trinity United Church in Chicago. By now, everyone knows about this man who Obama calls his ""spiritual mentor"". Obama is dangerous for America when he looks up to a man who says horrible things about America and travels to enemy countries like Libya to meet with Kadafy with Louis Farrakhan. Obama is very naive, wants socialist programs we can't afford and has said he would meet with Castro, Hugo Chavez and Ahmadinijead without pre-conditions."
1,Pure pablum,"Slick propaganda in the mold of Jimmy Carter's ""Why Not The Best"" in 1976. The ink raises many mysteries.Where is there any evidence that this man can actually write a book, or that he wrote this book?Where is his college thesis from Columbia, or anything he wrote in undergraduate school?How does one become President of any Law Review - let alone HARVARD - without writing an article, or a case note, or a comment?How does any law professor anywhere - even one hired at Univ of Chicago - survive on a faculty without publishing ANYTHING anywhere?This book appears to be another fraud written by a political ghost writer. Save your money and your hope."
1,Most destructive POTUS ever.,"I will admit that I have not read on word from this book. Today, I am taking a play from the liberal playbook and giving a one star review to a book that I know nothing about because I despise the person that authored the book. It was written by a man who is destroying our great country with his agenda. He will exploit anything or anyone for his own personal political gain."
1,Audacity Of Hope,The title should read Audacity of a President.!!Not very impressive.. He tends to write what we want to here.. Similar to his presidency..WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
1,Obama,This book just shows you what a radical he really is.... and the left are in a slobbering love affair with this creep who is destroying our country.
5,A Must Read.,"Barack Obama has a message that is resonating with a huge number of Americans. He is a gifted orator who has ignited the interest of many college age students. He is also the author of this bestselling book. If you have not yet read the book, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of see what he has to say.You might also want to read the following:Hopes and Dreams: The Story of Barack Obama;Living History;The Extreme Makeover of Hillary (Rodham) Clinton;Worth the Fighting for: A Memoir;Why Courage Matters: The Way to a Braver Life"
4,As a potential voter in the upcoming primary...,"I read this book to try and gain a better understanding of how Barack would govern as president and determine if I would support his candidacy on super tuesday. This book met my expectations in that reguard in introducing me to who Obama is as a thinker and problem solver. If you don't want to read the whole book but are looking to understand his domestic and international policy agenda's, focus your time on chapters 5 and 8, I found these to be the most useful."
3,after the fact,"I read this long after the fact. It's a pretty fair book, but with all the ensuing disappointments of his administration, it doesn't speak well for his ""audacity."""
3,A very long campaign speech,"I was not a bit surprised by the content of this book and probably would not have chosen to read it if it weren't my book club's pick. All were agreed that it was a lot of nice stuff, and he seems like a really great guy but that we would have had more respect for him as a presidential candidate if he had taken a perhaps controversial stand on something. We all felt like he seems like the kind of person we'd like to have in our circle of friends, but we got nothing that compells us to run out and vote for him. We were all a bit puzzled by the word ""Audacity"" in the title. There was nothing that smacked of audacity here."
3,"But when it comes to practical solutions, not so much","I usually get through a book in a day or two; this book took over a month. I find Senator Obama's style of talking appealing; but he writes exactly as he talks - - - parenthetically. He has a soaring vision of emotional patriotism, freedom, and equality; but when it comes to practical solutions, not so much."
3,Exceeds low expectations,"Politicians crank out lots of books like this when we get near election-time, so one can only expect so much. That being said, TAoH was a decent read and helped ease some concerns I had about our probable next president. While it seemed to lack focus at times, it did come across as more authentic and more genuine than other books of this type. That, alone, makes it worth reading.Recommended."
5,Great Book,I really enjoyed reading this book. It is especially helpful in understanding President Obama's goals and reasons for the way he thinks about everything.
4,"Bob Hollander's Review of ""The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream""","Well written. Barack Obama appears to be aware of the various sides of issues. I don't agree with all of his ideas, but his thoughts are certainly compelling. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know Barack Obama's political philosophy and ideas."
4,Engaging Insight,"Senator Obama has put into print his ideas and experences in his time in Washington. What comes through is the man's optimistic vision of the future, both for America and the world. He brings a point of view shaped by a type of life few have experienced. And it's precisely this difference that allows him a perspective that few Americans share, but most would benefit from.I wish all the best of success in his quest for the presidency."
4,Refreshing,"Barack Obama is a refreshing politician. If he can be taken at his word (and apparently he can), it is so pleasing to read his ideas on major issues without all the usual obscure language. He speaks his mind simply and with a moral conviction. While I haven't made my mind up about the next presidential election, Obama certainly has me thinking he is a candidate worth considering. I recommend reading this book. It does give one hope that our government can make progress on significant issues."
1,"not about hope, about politics","Okay, I wanted to read this book because of the recent campaigns...I thought it would help me clue in to the man himself. And it does, he is a genuine man with a lot of heartfelt motives. But to be honest, he's better at speeches. I closed this book before I finished the first chapter and stacked it away on a shelf. It would be great for a person who is completely aware of political agendas, history, current events. For me, no thrill here, none at all. A lot of name dropping, names I didn't have a clue about, and a lot of political ramble that truly went in one ear and out the other. So if politics is your thing then this is your book but, I prefer an interesting read. Can't waste my time in that one."
4,insightful,"this is a very well written book by a very well-spoken man. since this man could be the democratic presidential candidate, i felt it was a good idea to understand him and know his views. rather than listen to the media tell me those things, or have my friends tell me those things, it seemed a much better idea to have barack obama tell me those things. if you intend to vote (and you really should), you should educate yourself on both the issues and the front-runner candidates. what better way than to listen to them, and not to an opinionated media, or the public at large? now, on to the most recent writtings from hillary, mccain, and giuliani....space puppy - out"
3,Get to know your president,"(audiobook review) If there are any holes left in this, I couldn't find them. If you want to get to know who your president is and what he's all about, definately check this out. Obama discusses race, religion, sex, and family. He makes many valid points; however, in coming to the conclusion that hispanic immigrants should be treated like human beings, he really doesn't come to a convincing solution to the problem of lack of jobs, or where the majority of latino earned money goes in this country (like, back to their home countries). But, maybe some of that is none of my business...so make sure you learn Spanish? I don't know, if you're curious about his views, check it out. I have a hard time not liking him, and he's even a lawyer."
1,Fiction?,During the last four years the president and biographers have shown that this book is a work of historical fiction. Shouldn't it be categorized as such?
2,Audacity of Hope,"Glad I only paid a penny for this. However, more people should read it and read it carefully. Those who do will definitey know to get him out of office as soon as possible."
4,Intresting & Well Written,I found this book intresting and well written. I was thinking to suggest that he should write a book about the elections and the pain of being a family man and running for office.
5,True Audacity,The real Audacity for me is the fluency and style of the writing; I will seriously recommend this book. Well done Obama (not Osama) for sticking to your name and heritage. Power to you and the election!
5,wonderful book!,"I got this as a gift, it was a great surprise for a friend. I'm told it is greatly written and that I have to read it too!"
1,Such a waste of good paper and my time,"This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Seriously, it such a load of crap that I was barely able to finish it. The best thing I can say about it is that at least I didn't actually spend my money on it. It was given to me as a gift. I'm going to get rid of it as soon as possible. It's not fit for another person to read so I'll probably use it to light a camp fire with or something. I recommend pretty much ANY book over this garbage!"
5,Great Read!,A great book to read if you want a little more insight into the political ideals of Barack Obama. Highly Recommended!
2,Nothing new here,"Senator Obama is an engaging speaker and has potential to be a leader, but this book doesn't offer any new insights or solutions to the political climate we have today in the USA. Nicely written but the next book will tell whether he can avoid the decline into standard partisan behavior now that the Dems are in charge of Congress. Time will tell."
4,Funniest Book Ever,"This is one of the funniest things I have ever read in my entire life. When I read what this man believed I had to check the cover to make sure I didn't buy some comedian's book. I think this man will have a second career after 2012 in comedy. All he has do is read what he has written in this book and he would have his own show. In fact, I think anyone who wants to be a comedian themselves should simply cut and paste this material immediately. I gave if four stars. It would have been five if he didn't try to mask this as a serious political book.For other funny books check out:Hey Ranger!: True Tales of Humor & Misadventure from America's National ParksThere's No Toilet Paper . . . on the Road Less Traveled: The Best of Travel Humor and Misadventure (Travelers' Tales Guides)"
5,Great Insight into his Political Stance,Reading this book is a great way to understand President Obama's policies and objectives in his own words.
5,Read It,This thoughtful and eminently readable book should be read by everyone whether they voted for Obama or not to better understand the man and his philosophy as well as our system of government and its current challenges. This balanced view will give you hope that what unites us is stronger than what divides us.
2,The audacity of arrogance,"Very disappointing read, nothing special, it has a tone of arrogance that I could not get over. I could not finish."
1,"Snore, snore","What a snoozer. Beats me why anyone asked him to write this book: at the time he wrote it he had very little experience doing much of anything. However, it WAS interesting to note the contrasts between what he SAID he believed and how he has actually governed 18 months into his Presidential term. My advice is PASS."
4,good ideas,"presents some really interesting ideas, but it's not something that really needs to be read all at once. a little dry sometimes, but some chapters are great and make you really appreciate his enthousiasm."
4,Short on Details but a good try to explore the issues,"I thought that Obama's book was a fairly good read. My grandma in love with her senator and even though she lives in a downstate conservative area where he is popular none the less as he is viewed as not a part of the Chicago machine. The book again rehashes his political philosophy and isn't so much a guide as it is a musing of generalities. Far more conversational then informative, I think it shows Obama to be a bit old fashioned in style. I feel with so many people with college degrees and a nasty cynical attitude it is important for him to work out the details and to present them to the American people if he wants to remain credible. Regardless, hats off to an American statesman and senator who has served my grandma and her town well."
1,Good Bye America,"Let's just be honest...this man is a- man with a agenda. He represents everything American dream has stood against. In one word, Communism! Take from the working class and give to the people who haven't earned a dime. How is it considered the american dream? What ever happend to working hard, saving money and lower taxes? Since when can we refuse to work and demand perferd treatment? If we lose sight of our consitution and our rights,that is when men like Barack Obama can write junk and be considerd ""enlightened"". You can't take freedom from someone who actually knows the constitution. For those who assume this is racism- shame on you! It dosn't matter what color a person is if they are trying to destroy the american dream. He is attacking the very ideals that make us a great nation!"
4,Haven't Read Yet,"My initial impression was the book was smaller than I anticipated -- only 4"" by 7"". That's probably why it's over 400 pages long. Haven't had a chance to read it yet but hopefully will get to it over the Holidays."
4,the voice of our next president?,"Barack Obama has written an accessible autobiography and political manifesto. He has taken care to organize it so as to present his political argument on the eve of his run for president. That is the main problem with the book: its main purpose is to support his political campaign. As a result, we get neither a satisfying presentation of his life story nor his political argument, but a little of both.Perpahs that is the best way to make a book like this widely accessible. His prodigious intellect (president of the Harvard Law Review), humor and abiding humanity are palpable. Still, Obama's dual purposes in authorship dilute both his narrative and his argument.I voted for him anyway."
4,A bright spot in an otherwise dim Democratic party,"With most books I read, I conclude either this person is an idiot or he's a lot smarter than I am. Barack Obama falls into the latter. Call him a political cheerleader, or whatever you think he might be. He inspires the mind and the soul, reminds we are not the Democratic United States of America or Republician United States of America. He'll be labeled as a ""flash in the pan"" or as someone who is simply ""pumping sunshine"" (I don't think I skipped a cliche') But truthfully, as for myself after 6+ years of what we've been getting, it would be a welcomed break. In short, buy the book and jump on the bandwagon."
4,A liberal conservative (or conservative liberal) reviews Senator Obama's book...,"As another reviewer pointed out, I was most surprised to find this to be an actual BOOK ... not a self-serving political treatise. Clearly what we are doing is not working (at least for most folks). It's time for a change, but an educated, informed, reasonable change.Senator Obama points the way here. If he's serious (and he appears to be), I would strongly support such a candidate."
4,Insight into a future presidential candidate?,Anyone who wants insight into the character of Barack Obama need only read his book. His sometimes-surprising stances on issues and his vision of what Americans need and want is both a look into his own personal philosophy as well as a possible vision of future life in these United States. Worth a read
4,good look into obama,"I thought this book was just you needed if you had any question about where obama stood on anything. It shows you he will stand his ground and his feet are firmly planted, it also shows you he is rather smart compared to some of the other people we have in politics here in the United States."
3,Over my head,"In reading this book , you can tell Barrack Obam is a very inteligent man. You get a good sense/feel for his ideas and convictions. Which is why I bought the book in the first place. But the problem I had with this book (which I did not finish), is that Mr. Obama is so intelligent that much of the book was just plain over my head/over my level of understanding. I will attempt to finish it in the near future, Maybe I just wasn't really in the right mood to read it at the time. But be prepared with a dictionary near by while reading it."
4,interesting,After reading this I truly respect and admire Obama-- it will be interesting to see if his politics truly follow what he states are his values and goals.
1,BAD BUY,"BASED ON HIS ""AUDACITY"" --- VERSUS THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE PRINCIPALS THAT HAS MADE THIS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH - I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH HIS ""PREACHING AND NARCISSISTIC"" APPROACH TO THIS COUNTRYS PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE !!"
4,"Very Thoughtful, A Little Dry","In his book Barack lays out his opinions on a wide range of issues, not pandering and trying to impress anyone, but just telling things the way he sees it. Obviously people will give this book negative reviews because of their political bias (most of them haven't touched the book). Anyways, I am impressed with Barack's willingness to lay it all out on the line, and take a stance on what he believes. Admittedly, the book is a little dry and slow in parts, but the man is a US Senator, presidential hopeful and a father, he doesn't have time to fluff it up for everyone. So, if you have some interest in what Obama really has to say, not what you are fed in the main stream media, pick it up and give it a look, you might be suprised."
4,The Audacity of Hope,"There is alot of interest in what Mr. Obama has to say. He has titled this book correctly when using the word audacity. We as Americans want change to our world, government especially, and hope for the future. What Barack presents is current to our surroundings and way of thought. WE want change, but the change has to start from within ourselves and to ask questions. We again should be willing to accept responsibility for our personal actions and to make our government more responsible for their actions and not so quick to respond to the special intersts for all changes. Changes should be for all of us. If disagree happens and it will, then discuss it and work out a solution. WE as American's have a great way of life and we need to work at it all the time."
1,Megalomaniacal tones abound,I like to know how other people think especially so regarding business 'competitors'. So I read this to gain perspective. My opinion is that this book is a political set up for a scam and it seems very likely it may have been ghost written. Megalomaniacal tones abound and a basic but overwhelming misunderstanding of the American experience. This is very sad. I am not proud to have paid a royalty for this rag but that is the system we live in.
1,Couldn't get through it,"I tried to read this book when President Obama's campaign was just a rumor, made it halfway through before I couldn't read it anymore."
4,Even Conservatives Can Appreciate This One,"As a conservative Republican, I was leery when I first opened ""The Audacity of Hope."" Now having finished, I can say that I truly respect Barack Obama. His desire to maintain integrity, hold to his values, and truly bring about a better America are admirable. Of course, I don't think his plans for bringing these things about are the most effective ones. With such an important political season coming up, everyone should read this book. The best way to make an informed vote is to really know the candidates, so take this opportunity to get to know Barack Obama."
5,"Great book, a must read!","If half of what Barack says in this book is how he feels then he should be president of the US! This is a great eye opening book...a bit idealistic but full of enthusiasm, amazing compassion for fellow man, and an amazing understanding of the constitution and the law. Very smart man! Must read!"
2,got no soul,"Plenty of ideas but nothing to back it up with and the hope message wears thin when you realize how little this man has actually done in his lifetime. Obama is the perfect candidate for the ""Entitlement Generation"" who earned nothing but wants it all right now. I left a Vertigo U2 concert in 2005 feeling that Bono is a much more substantial individual and much more inspiration. Yes, Bush has been a 87% failure and a destroyer of many things America but that doesn't mean this Pied Piper's message will lead anywhere but further destruction for a host of different reasons. Let's ""Hope"" that we can do better than this empty soul."
4,Good read,"It's as if he's too good to be true. It's a pretty easy read, and entertaining but it all seems a little too easy. Still I enjoyed it especially after reading Dreams from My Father. I feel as if I have a good idea where he's coming from."
3,Audacity of Hope,"This is my first book reading on the Kindle, it was slow at the beginning, but it is picking up and I am learning lots of new words. I am on chapter 2. I read on the way to work and from work."
3,Obama book,It was cool but the cover was dirty so I really didn't like that since i got that book as a gift for someone.
5,Excellent service,"This book came on time, there was no problem at all, and it was a good price and I am a completely satisfied customer. I would use this service and again and recommend it to anyone."
1,"according to my style analyzer, he didn't write this","i voted for him and supported his campaign, based largely on the books. Now I find a dissonance between the personality displayed in the books and the personality revealed in the man. I only see this sort of thing in people with a hidden agenda, and frankly, it disturbs me. I like and trust honest folk who, when you talk with them, you get a sense of openness, not a pasted on smile for effect. The comments which follow this review are mainly involved with the question, ""who wrote this book?"""
1,"Hate it, every page!","No way, No How, No Obama! Why do you read garbage or listen to garbage? To relize you are sian and they are not!!"
1,Why does Amazon carry Racist books?,"This man is obviously a racist...he and his wife and children attended a racist church for 20 years. Had he been a Klan member for 20 years, would Amazon carry this book? It's sad."
1,Obama is a mental lightweight,"I browsed this book of lies and half-truths from the man with the messiah complex. Barry O. has no clue as to what makes America great. His election would destroy our economy. With higher taxes and more government regulation on the horizon, what business would want to invest in the future (except maybe trial lawyers). Barry O. would hurt our education system with more political correctness and less true learning.Barry O. would weaken our military and support every anti-American thug and communist around the world. Our country would be left wide open to unrestricted illegal immigration. This guy is a true empty suit who would be the most liberal President ever. If you have any intelligence at all, you will never follow B. Hussein Obama. Obama is a disaster waiting to happen."
5,What Obama Knows,"This is what Barack Obama knows: There's a revolution going on in America and it's happening from the INSIDE out.Is it his passion, ideals, vision, or voice? Or all of the above. His call for HOPE is the single word that is now resonating with people all around the world. In times of dispair, HOPE is a life raft, a hand up, a smile, a pat on the back. It is the single thing we need to remind us that the only thing that we can realy change is US. Ourselves. And yes, working together, we can change the U.S. too!Alexia Parks, author of Rapid Evolution, Seven Words That Will Change Your Life Forever!"
3,Fresh Air,"At last someone who tries to join americans together instead of tearing them apart. If you did not hear his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, go find it and really listen to him. I hope he is our next President because if this country continues to ignore its citizens, refusing basic human necessities, outsourcing jobs, no health care, and continue the use of illegal immigrants for cheap labor, there will be a new revolution. For what G.W. has spent in Iraq, we could have National Health Care, saved Social Security, and still gave all 300 million of the U.S. citizens a million dollars thus eliminating poverty. Obama's book is very uplifting."
1,a simple man,"I listened to the audio book.His narration is entertaining. The content of the book is meloncholy and full of flurishing. There is no real meat here. This is the story of a man whos father left him, he is taken to Indonesia, and his youth iscluttered with no clear heritage or culture.His mother seems to have jungle fever, and Barak indicates this in his comments.This man is simply a man distracted with the task of trying to establishhis value through his heritage.My oppinion is he should just blaze his own trail and forget abouttrying to be someone else."
1,Mr Obama's words,"I think Mr Obama says it best by replacing business with book.I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got best selling book -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."
3,WHAT,I just wanted to see or read what makes this guy tick. just read it and you fine out in a hurry
5,Great,"A wonderful book detailing his senatorial bid and his reign in the Illinois state senate. It has politics, humanity, and a great personal family side of President Obama."
5,Great Service,The service that I received was great. My book was in great condition and I received it in a timely fashion. I'm not hard to please so the vendor may be getting off easy on this review but to be specific I got my book 4 working days after I purchased it. It was in the condition that was promised and to sum it all up I would gladly purchase from them in the future.P. Snow
4,The Audacity of Hope,"I went out and purchased this book as I was mighty curious as to why the public seems to be so entranced by this enigma that is Barack Obama. I read it with an open mind; not pro Obama or anti. His ideas and ease of rhetoric are flowing throughout the pages. Barack seems to be a very opinionated person, he wouldn't be in politics if he wasn't. After giving this book a once over, I'd recommend it to anyone fence sitting, or even a conservative. Obama truly seems to be a once in a lifetime leader and excels at linguistics, good considering our current President has a tough time putting together a coherent sentence.Enemies Among Us"
5,Exxcellent!,Obama has written a highly intelligent and very informed book. It ranges very widely and shows both his varied background and his erudition. A fine book by a very intelligent young man.
3,Not my Dream.,"A Floating space city is certainly an entertaining idea...but that's just it. The tone of te book borders on audaciuosness and a plug for the presidency. Some of the political ideas are interesting and certainly cause for debate, but they highlight Barack's inexperience and almost tease you wih a child-like approach to his platform. Even though I disagree with the some of tennants and suggestions, it is still worth taking the time to read this book."
5,Audacity of Hope,"Excellent read. There's an undeniable humility in Mr. Obama too often absent from most public figures. I found this particular piece to be a good read, and a thoughtful effort."
5,the truth,"If you want to know THE REAL Senator Obama, this book will tell you. Don't listen to the media talking heads. Read this book. You will be impressed by a man of integrity and strength. His views are mixed, both liberal, in the middle, and conservative."
4,Insightful,"This book is highly intellectual. Insights are very deep. I would just like to add a few things:One has to view the race obsession lightly, it is not always someone's experience.Obama is a wise man who himself has come to these conclusions - policies that are for everyone's good or are at least viewed that way will always be supported more than policies targeted at a community, as this tends to isolate or make individuals guilty."
4,The Audacity,"The book that catapulted Barack Obama to power, this work is important in several respects to the present American. In this work, Obama explains his core philosophies. This being said, the informed voter can gain a keep insight into Obama morally as well as politically through the Audacity of Hope. Politics aside, the book is well-written and easy to read, which is what this review is, at its core, about. Does it represent something transformative? Probably not, as reality is always different than ideology, but it is still important to read such a book with importance to the current President of the United States."
2,Racism at it's hightest!!!!!,"It was not that well written. However, like his first it showed his true feelings of the white race. Great insight into his views that do not have a lot of value."
3,A New Zealander's perspective,"An interesting insight into the thoughts of President Barack Obama, written when he the Senator of Illinois. While no one can deny that his aspirations for a more inclusive, more progressive America are expressed in very emotive and thoughtful way, I personally do find it troubling that on some of the tougher ethical stances, which are equally important for supporters of both sides, that he does tend to hedge his bets both ways Chapter 6 Faith is a good example of this. I consider this read a 4 out of 5 for readability and a 2 out of 5 for personal agreement to what he is actually saying. I look forward to re-reading this when President Obama is in the last part of his second term (At this stage I do not see the Republicans being able to find a personality that will be able to surpass that of the President) and reviewing my thoughts."
5,You Don't Need a Reviewer to Know This Book Is Worth Reading,"What could be more important to understanding the new President than hearing what he has to say? After a long campaign of stories about Obama, this book tells the story from Obama's perspective.I found the book engaging, motivational, and interesting. Obviously, Barack Obama finds ways to touch the American people, and he does so in this book."
2,Quotations from Chairman Barack,"This book is not written by a human being, it is written by a politician running for office, afraid of offending swing voters by actually standing for something definite (other than being elected). One gets the impression that Chairman BHO learned all his lessons in flipfloppery, feel-good piffle and general all-around wishy-washiness by sitting at the feet of Mitt Romney. That God (or the next best thing, whichever comes first) should have learned all his tricks from the Devil should come as no surprise. There's not a dime's worth of difference between the Dems and the Reps, and if you think there is, the more fool you."
2,Light Weight Book by a Light Weight Author,"Not a bad read if you want to understand President Obama, but really quite forgettable overall."
2,Pure Torture,"The reason I give this book a two is because it was pure torture for me. I was bored silly. Occasionally, he would say something that I thought was interesting. It took me forever to get through it. I recommend it only because everyone should read what the president thinks about stuff. For me, it was generally a lot of propoganda, and I voted President Barack."
3,audacity of hope,"bought for my 22 yr old daughter. She was enthusiastic to receive this book but it has taken a back seat to the Twilight series which she vowed was ""too cheesy"" and she would never read. Her sister got this series and they have both speed read through them. Sorry Barack. I expect you will get your due."
5,"Full of ""ah ha"" moments","I am amazed at Barack Obama's ability to shed light on the political landscape and the values with which he navigates that landscape. I find myself telling my husband...""Listen, honey,..."" and then going on to read him yet another passage. The amazing thing is that he is always ready to hear another passage. It is full of history (the interesting parts), insight, and practicality. I have enjoyed every word."
1,"It should have been titled ""Platitudes""","I gave this book a shot, but it is so tired and ""obama-ish""Never have I read a book with a platitude every other word. Annoying."
3,Read this before you vote in 08,"I read this booking hoping for more. Instead, I found the typical political memoir that pandered to just about every interst group and political issue. I didn't think it was particularly well-written or organized. If anything, this book made me realize that even as a Democrat, I would most likely not vote for Obama.It's worth reading and it will give the reader a better handle on who Obama allegedly is. Overall, I felt he pandered to everyone and I didn't have a strong enough sense about who he really is politically. He's all over the place, IMO."
4,audacity of hope review,"good book, political writings intermixed with personal experiences to convey the ideas in a better way. I'm planning to keep it and re read chapters from time to time."
5,The Audacity of Hope,"After 6 years of cringing every time Bush attempts to complete an entire sentence, it gives me goose bumps to read someone as eloquent and as articulate as Barack Obama. Here is a man who can think dynamically about difficult issues and can lead us back to our American Dream through common sense. Now what's more American than that! Read this book. You'll be glad you did :o)"
5,Excellent Read!,Iformative read about Barack Obama and what his thought's are on the state of the nation and the direction we're heading.
3,Political stuff,This was ok if a person is into reading and studying politics - learned a lot and also there were things that I did not quite understand.
5,the audacity of hope,he will need this plus the help of god which he have and a strong woman by his side he will accomplish a lot more and my hats off to mr president my god be in front and in back which he is
4,Just a working stiff,"I drive a bus by day and work as a security guard at night to support my family. I read this book on my breaks at the rate of about 25 pages a day. I am by no means a worldly person but I enjoyed reading this book, it lifted my spirits and gave me a little encouragement in the process of government."
2,Audacity is right,"Ok, I am not a fan of President Obama. I am not anti-Obama either. I was soured on him when he won a Nobel Peace Prize just for being elected. I never understood why so many people who actually did something for the world were passed over and he got an award for basically running for president without yet acomplishing anything. I have to wonder if they had waited if he would still receive the award today. Well I am getting off on a tangent. That being said, I still gave the book an open minded read. What is in it is most of his catch phrases from speeches. I was hoping there would be some backing and research for his views but that was completely absent. As another reviewer said ""it is a mile wide and an inch deep intellectually speaking.""That is my opinion too."
3,Too Much background to Reclaim Future,"Although the book was well-written, the style was simplistic. It would make a terrific history text for 8-10th graders to gain an understanding of the development of politics. For my book club, the book didn't have the depth or insight as we had anticipated."
1,propaganda,"I just finished reading this book today. It seems to me that the book lacks any real subject matter that you can lean on to say ""hey, this Obama stands for ____"". The book basically hits the standard fix-the-world topics, but delves into very few of them. This is a great strategy to get Obama'a face out in the view of the masses, but I do not recommend this book."
5,required reading for High School Students,"I propose this book replaces whatever current textbook is used in the junior year of High School for the ""Government"" class. Maybe someday this book will change the title of that class objective to ""Political Leadership"".With Mr. Obama soon to be our Prez Obama, I'm glad he took the time and effort to write this book when he did. The historical references and names included will be a great stepping stone for students. As a writer, I'm enthralled with the style and voice of this book. It plows through, with a unique tone, history and current events. Dry and dusty facts come to life, current events have an impetuous flare!Fascinating reading, strong writing, a likeable hero, in the moment, when history has tilted.Great reading and for those that read the credits, a nice peak at the world of publishing..."
5,A Man Who Means What He Says,A fantastic book written by a man who is proving to be a promise keeper of the highest sort. Phenominal writing.
3,Curosity fulfilled,"This purchase was originally an action of my curiosity, in that I had heard so much publicity about this book,(most critical) I was just really curious to read what it actually did say. I believe we should know what all is entailed, have a thorough knowledge on a topic, before we begin speaking about something. Being interested in politics, I felt this was ""important"" in my reading selection list. I haven't gotten through the entire listening but thus far I'm finding it most interesting."
5,Excellent insight into his policy aspirations,"I read this book before he became the President, and now as I see the policies he has set forth and his comtemplative demeanor during these very trying times, I believe he is for real."
1,Someone Please Define The American Dream?,"I can't remember the American Dream encompassing wealth redistribution, having to apologize for your country, appointing a collection of elitist bottom-feeders for your staff, and robbing the taxpayer for trillions of dollars. Oh well, I must have had the wrong country."
3,Thought Provoking,"Although this book was not what I had expected it to be, it none the less was very thought provoking. I believe Senator Obama gave some good insights of government and offered some interesting ideas for possible solutions to the many problems afflicting this country's government."
2,Such a b.s. snowjob,"You would really have to take leave of your critical faculties (Sen. Clinton termed it a ""willing suspension of disbelief"") to think this memoir had anything material to say about Sen. Obama's capabilities to be a president. The fact is, he's a by-product of Chicago machine politics who brags about his experience as a ""community organizer"" (wow, he organized the slums) who is in over his head. I guess I would recommend buying this book after Sen. Obama has lost in November, when these self-indulgent meanderings will clutter the bargain bin even more than they do now."
1,Typical Socialist Garbage,"Save your money, BO is a clown that has risen because of Affirmative Action and white guilt. Of course if you are a Kool-Aid drinker then read on..."
1,This Book is Worth One Penny!,How can you believe anything that President Barry Sotero says? This is a book of Fiction. Everything about Barry Sotero AKA Barrack Obama has all been a lie. The price of this book is one penny. Worth at least that much on a cold winter night if you need some kindling.
4,Intelligent and Refreshing,It's almost as if he already knew he would be front runner for the Presidency!
1,False advertisement,"Do not purchase this product if you think you are going to get what you see in the picture. This advertisement shows a signed copy of this text book, it's a lie. Not only is the book, I received, not signed by B Obama; but it was also not the first print. The book I received was a re-print of the first print. That does not make it a first print but a re-print. My experience was a complete victim of ""False Advertisement"" without a doubt. In addition to this, the book I received was in poor condition."
5,Hope!,"The ""Audacity of Hope"" gives me hope. Finally someone who has sensible ideas, high ideals, and a plan for our future. This is a wonderful book and should be 'required' reading for ALL Americans."
5,Very good service,"Had purchased from Butcher and Packer some years ago, and most recently became pleased to re-order a variety of different spices from themselves.Package arrived very prompt, shipped very good condition,and each pound of spice packaged very professionally separated from the next.Logically, Butcher and Packer are among the best assets for Amazon and its customers.Shall order far more frequently than in the past,cause their level of quality has never decreased.Anyone wanting to buy spices, i commend this vendor affiliated with Amazon.Keep up the good work.Will submit same exact review for all items of order cause am not intending to review each one separately."
1,Liberal Bilge,"Don't worry, I borrowed this book from the Library and wouldn't have wasted a cent on it even before I read it. Now that I have, I can authoritatively inform you that it is full of meaningless Liberal drivel. Its only redeeming value is that it is a somewhat entertaining read through the benefit of hindsight."
4,War is ... Complicated,"When Siegfried Sassoon threw away his medals and wrote against Great Britain's further participation in WWI, the British government responded by throwing him in a mental asylum for shell shocked soldiers. After all, a ""gentleman"" would have to be mad to oppose the ""good"" war.It didn't change Sassoon's mind; however, during his stay in the asylum, he met and encouraged another WWI poet, Wildred Owen, to write some of the most damning and movie poetry of the war. Both Sassoon and Owen went back to the front. Sassoon survived, but Owen died just a few days before the Armistice.This is a very well acted film about a little known event, especially in the U.S. The only complaint I have is that I could not purchase this DVD in widescreen, only letterbox."
2,wrong aspect ratio,"Marvelous movie, one of the best adaptations ever, but it is a shame that the dvd is full monitor in stead of the original widescreen version. This disrespect for the director's vision keeps amazing me.Jos HodeniusMaastricht, Holland"
4,A Good Movie with a Lot to think about,"This was an excellent period movie that showed several of the literary luminaries of the period in treatment for war related mental issues. It also depicted the horrors of the treatments which might have been worse than the horrors of the battlefields. The uniforms, battle scenes, acting, and story were excellent and well done. It was a sad story that didn't have a happy ending. The horror of war and the aftermath of treatment appeared to be realistic and it was very moving calling up empathy for the characters both the patients and the doctors portrayed. It is a story that needed to be told, especially, in view of world events that are now occurring."
1,Not in English,"The production quality of the dvd was fine, but (unless I am missing something here) what was failed to be mentioned was that it was entirely in JAPANESE! If you speak Japanese, then this dvd would probably be great for you and it would probably be between 3 1/2 to 4 stars, but since mine is terrible, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Very useful,"Highly recommended. I rather liked this book, learned from it, and even quoted it. Insightful & well organized. Best book I've read in this general subject area. Should replace most of the fluffy business strategy books I've been suckered into buying."
1,Only for the unitiated,"I bought this book based on the ""5 star"" reviews out here - unfortunately after seeing it, I am having to send it back. It covers some *very* basic stuff. Not at all useful."
5,Mustard Seeds!,"Great product, arived very fast (I'm in Korea). Tastes great for my Indian cooking I do. Crush them roast them it does not matter. Comes in a pretty big bag. The seeds kind of static stick to the thick bag so you kinda have to scoop them out. But all in all I recomend this product to anyone! Thank you -Andrew"
3,"Solid follow-up to ""Sound of Goodbye""","This is a very worthy follow-up to ""Sound of Goodbye,"" with a lot more remixes. Doesn't have the poignancy of the earlier single, but I'll give it a whirl."
5,"Enchanting, Gifted, Charming Tasha!","Charismatic,perhaps eccentric,Tasha exhibits an extraordinary insight and interpretation of life around her that is shared with us through her wonderful illustrations and stories, written and verbal. We should all cherish life as simply and profoundly as she does at Corgi Cottage. Really makes you reflect on life's priorities."
2,How do you define chaos?,"This book may be useful for children with only ADD with no hyperactivity or children not suffering from any biological problems. But if you define chaos by not remembering to turn off lights or flush the toilet or by forgetting homework, then I don't think you truely know what chaos is. I live with a ADHD and Bipolar child who truely causes chaos in my home, including hitting, slamming doors, throwing things, cutting his sister's hair, climbing out the window, etc., and he is only six. This book did not help me at all. It made me cry and wish I just had the problems they discussed. If you have true chaos choose another book. The Explosive Child by Ross Greene helped me a lot."
4,helpful ideas,"If you can get past the expectations of the author/mother there are a lot of great ideas to help life go smoother at home. Using calendars, lists for morning & evening preparations, and incentives more often than punishments has made life in our home a lot more peaceful!"
1,Prayers of Peter Marshall,"I would like to review the product but I have still not received the book I ordered on November 24, 2011."
2,"a lot of problems, a few bright spots","I bought this for $6, at a brick-n-mortar store. It was amusing and quirky at that price. At $10, there are much better deals for quality tuning, like the Sony and Panasonic pocket am/fm radios. Oddly enough, the build quality was OK, the tuning bezel was very stable, and the earphones were OK for the cost, driven with mono sound across both L/R, which is fine. The fm tuning was wide and not very sensitive. The AFC grabbed some station on most of the dial, but they hogged. Sound was ~OK, better with $20 headphones. On AM, there were a few fat dial-hogging locals (tuning bandwidth issue), and a weird squeeling-birdie sound around distant stations. You could tune those in extremely tight range with a lot of tweeking. Night AM was a crazy jungle. There is a lot of promise in the contruction and tuning mechanics, but the tuner circuits are buggy. I liked the pendant-hanging mode, once I shortened the cord a bit w/ a figure 8 knot."
2,Jwin Mini,Bought this to take to the gym to use on the closed circuit TVs there. Range is very limited and the clip on the back tends to come off. The arm band is pretty much non-functional also.
3,One ear receptor not working at all,"This is a nice light weight small radio I use out when I want to check on a radio show or news. Good sound. Unfortunately one of the buds is not working, not sure what happened."
2,Not high quality,"But what would expect for this price right? the lesson is always the same, quality is always less expensive at the end because we end up throwing away the cheap stuff tired of the bad quality of reception and sound."
3,Red Hat,This hat worked out very well as a birthday gift for a lady who deserves a Red Cowboy Hat. A red feather boa made the perfect hat band.
1,Stoessinger deserves better,"Don't buy this. You can get the same info for free. The doc is short and not worth it. Gives very little insight as to who Stoessinger is. Brevity of content does injustice to a man who fled Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, and who has taught generations of students that nobody ever truly wins a war. Courage - to love, to share, and live life to its fullest, is what he has taught me. Stoessinger is one of the last links to a past filled with tremendous uncertainty. He deserves more than this rip-off of an article."
2,Plus/minus,"Pluses: choice of 4 rings, good sound quality. Minuses: The LCD screen is dim and difficult to read and the battery craps out fairly quickly (yes I did charge it properly)"
3,good book falters towards the end,"First of all I'd have to give the first two thirds of this book a nine out of ten and the last third of this book a six out of ten. It seemed to me that after the careful expostition and elaborately unfolding storylines the last part of this book just unfolded way too fast. Also this story lacked a good antagonist. What was up with the king of gorhaut? He was way over the top. It was like he escaped from a bad goodkind or jordan novel into this book! As well some of the minor characters (roban, lisseut) were overwritten as they were pretty irrelevant to the story while my favorite character Rudel was a little underwritten (whatever happened to him at the end?). Despite these flaws and slight lack of payoff at the end this book did deliver good storytelling while avoiding most cliches that plague todays fantasy. overall I'd give it a seven out of ten"
3,"Beautiful sentences, moronic plot","It's a shame that Kay can write such lovely sentences, such beautiful words that lure the unsuspecting reader into mistaking such an unsubtle book for a great one. All you need to do is read the Gorhault council scene to know that you're not reading a writer who trusts his readers: he instead feels he has to hit us over the head with a 16-ton weight of characterization. I think _Tigana_ was an accidental success for Mr Kay, and that the pandering pastiche of Fionavar is more typical. This book is polished on the surface, but that's as deep as it goes. I suppose that makes it better than most fantasy. But doesn't Kay seem like he's capable of doing something better?"
2,I can't believe this book is so popular.,"The best Mr. Kay can do at characterizing the ruler of Gorhaut is to have him force another man's wife...during a council meeting. Obviously not a book for children, or for anyone unwilling to have Kay's attitudes about the characters beaten into their heads. He would have done better to have assumed the omniscient tone and said: ""He was a very, very bad man.""This book takes Tigana's flaws and elevates them into odious art, but it has few of Tigana's virtues. END"
2,Lyrical prose; poor pacing; developed but distant characters,"Lyrical prose; developed characters; but not enough happening! Not enough wonder or plot; it's more like a Historical epic; I never liked any of his characters and he meanders too much on the prose for my tastes; a lot of people love him though; if you loved LOTR then you may very well like this one . . . while I can appreciate his style, he isn't for me; if his pacing was faster, there would have been promise."
5,Better than....,"The first books I read by Guy Gavriel Kay were the Fionavar Tapestries. I loved them. The second book was Song for Arbonne. The third Tigana. I have to say that Song for Arbonne is my favorite. It has the perfect blend of intrigue, action, grace,and romance. Unlike Tigana, I felt more drawn to the characters and, as to my favorite Kay 'world'? It is that found in Song for Arbonne. For some reason, everything seemed more tangible in this story. Most Kay fans will likely disagree with me, but to each his own."
5,A fine historical novel,"It is interesting how the first series of books by GGK (The Fionavar Tapestry) was somewhat deceiving, in a sense that, as a fantasy trilogy, it established GGK as one of the greats of that genre, but also created an expectation that his subsequent books would fit into the same mold. They really don't; they are history novels that use a transparent trick of taking place in a parallel world where the familiar elements of human civilization develop under different names, with a (very) light sprinkling of the fantastical. Thus medieval Provence becomes Arbonne, medieval Italy - Portezza (or the peninsula where Tigana is located in the book of that name), Tang China becomes Kitai - which just happens to be the Russian word for China - in ""Under Heaven"", Byzantium becomes Sarantium, etc. If you are a fan of the historical novel genre, you will find ""A Song for Arbonne"" immensely satisfying."
5,Excellent book,"The beginning was a little slow, and the names were difficult at first for me. However, this is a great book. It is so good in fact that I think will read the rest of Kay's works to see if they are as good. It would be hard to give details of the story without revealing some its mystery. It's best to say, read it. In the first portion of the book very little happens, but it is essential to setting up the world and how its people live. Once the adventure begins, you are in for a wonderful treat."
4,Almost flawless,"I loaned this book - what a mistake -I doubt I'll ever see it again. It is an evocative and enchanting work rich in history and politics, religion and culture. There are plots, sub plots and Dickenesque twists of parentage. The liberal artistic and beautiful Arbonne threatended by the dour and dark forces of Gorhaut. The medieval lifestyle is elegantly portrayed and the one thing that did not ring true in the entire book was the king of Gorhaut engaging in sexual exploits with the wife of a Coran in front of his nobles. A strict and fundamentalist society does not tolerate such behaviour even in it's kings. It may be harsh treatment but this single slip loses GG kay my fifth star. It was just too large an error for me to take!"
4,Mint shampoo,"Cocamidopropyl betaine is derived from coconut oil, is non-toxic and is used in Johnson's Baby Wash. Since it is plant-derived and not a man-made chemical, they are able to list the shampoo as chemical-free. This shampoo is great for color-treated hair."
5,VERY fine hair is now full of volume!,"I have super fine hair. I mean, I can use a child size ponytail holder for my hair. It's flat against my head and doesn't hold styles. I LOVE LOVE this shampoo (and conditioner). My hair is shiny, clean, soft and full of volume! I was worried about finding chemical free products (I'm currently switching all of my beauty products to chemical free) but I'm finding the organic/natural versions of every product I switch is way better. Think of it like an organic plant based food diet - you feel better and look better! These products do the same - nature provides us with everything we need."
1,Was unsatisfactory,My scalp itched terriby after using. I must be allergic to something in the shampoo & wish I had not ordered it.
3,It DOES contain chemicals!,"I was just about to purchase this product as I have been looking for some good chemical-free products but this DOES contain a potentially toxic chemical: Cocamidopropyl betaine. How can it then claim to be chemical free? I am giving it a rating of 3 simply because I HAVE to give a rating, and I am also trying to at least be partially fair because I have not used it. I simply wanted to point out that fact that it is NOT chemical free as advertised."
5,Everyday elegance,"These glasses look so much prettier in person than they do online. They make your table look like you spent a fortune on glassware, and are the perfect size!"
4,Great Glasses for a good price,"These glasses are attractive, sturdy and have a good weight. A full glass of milk looks great in them. Only problem is my meaty hands have a little trouble getting inside to thoroughly clean them."
5,FANTASTIC headset for a low price@,I have purchased very expensive headset and this a equivalent to the $100 headset. The sound quality is excellent.
3,Nady Studio Headphones BOGO,"I bought the deal. You get what you pay for with these, they're okay, but both sets have a tendency to have the signal fade on the right hand earpiece so you're listening to a mono signal. This is particularly annoying while recording. I've tried rerouting the signal through different outlet and through different components...same story. If you are a home hobbyist doing personal projects...these are probably okay, though I probably would look a little higher up the available models."
1,Badly Done,"You can't blame it on a low budget. Here it is in a nut shell. A bad script and really bad direction leads to bad acting. I believe all the actors in this film is capable of so much more but they were given the short end of the stick. This picture had real potential, but the production behind it couldn't meet the challenge. I'm a person who usually finds good in films that others blast. This film is plain bad."
1,Not the classic version!,"I really like the book, but the movie... not so much. I was really excited when I found a new version of this great book. The movie looks like a homemade one with cheap make up. I was expecting a lot more! This movie should not have the same title as the book. In the movie, Dr. JeKyll (who turned into Mr. Hyde) runs around at night raping and killing women. He works in a lab, which is not in his home, and makes experiences with monkeys. Well, these are just a few examples of how different the movie is from the classic."
2,Not recommended for guitarists,"As a guitarist, I use some of Otis' licks and admire his creativity and power. Otis is a master of the bend, pull, and hammer technique. This particular recording is almost un-listen-able because the two guitars seem to be battling for supremacy by going their own way. They are neither complementary, harmonic, nor do they take build on the other's previous lick. I bought the recording so I could brush up on Otis; that was disappointing, and I have not enjoyed even casually listening to it."
4,Great live videos and courses. Problems with analog control,"If you like the exotic cars this game may be for you. Opportunites to drive a McLaren, GT90, F50, and Jaguar are exciting. The videos and information on the cars themselves is great as well. Much better than the newer High Stakes version. The game did not operate properly in the two player mode when either controller was set to work in the analog mode. The steering wheel controllers may alleviate that problem, but I do not have one. At this price, it is one of the better racing games out there. I have enjoyed it more than the others."
4,Great buy for a favorite gaming system,Dug out my Playstation 1 and didn't want discard it. Purchased this and a few other games and gave it to my nephews. Haven't seen them in the sunlight since. I go into the cave occasionally to teach the youngsters what pain is.
3,Ok,"Well, what can I say, it's an old PS one game. It used to be one of my favorite games for the original playstation and I had been trying to find a copy in town for years without any success. Sadly though I was disappointed when I finally got it. don't get me wrong, it was great shape and came fast in the mail. Everything I could hope for. The problem is just that games have come so far since the PS one day. I just didn't find any joy in playing it, not as much as I remember. Control is terrible. I am happy I was able to find it on Amazon though, otherwise it would have continuted bothering me trying to search with no success."
4,one of the best PS1 games,the graphics used to look great but now I've played PS2 and I think they look kind of bad but this is one of the best playstation games out there use the code to get the ford indigo its the best car
1,A lousy game,"I got the PC version of this game and its A far cry from the others in the NFS series. The graphics are horrid, the cars are weird not more normal cars like the ferraris or jaguars in the other need for speeds. The cars are hard to control, its way to easy to spin out and crash. The menu controls are hard to use to, for instance most of the options dont have A pull-down menu you have to cycle through all the options. If you want great racing get Need for Speed 3, High Stakes, or Porsche Unleashed."
1,Corning Wear,"THis product arrived in the oringal box, not inside a bigger box with padding. So of course there were broken pieces. The company had no replacement, so i sent it back for a refund. Didn't get the refund after a whole week, had to contact amazon and cooking.com to ask where the refund was, still haven't gotten it......Wont order things from Cooking.com again."
2,Not worth the price,I was not impressed when i recieved my order. Everything was a lot smaller then i expected and it definately wasn't worth the price. I'd return it but everything was so tightly packed together i couldnt even get the box closed again.
1,Poorly Packed by Macy's,"When the Corningware came, it was broken. It was very poorly packed by Macy's."
1,Trading on the Corning name,"I would give this product zero stars if I could.For those who are not familiar with the original U.S.-made glass/ceramic Corning Ware, this cheaply made substitute may seem like a good deal. For those of us who still have pieces of the original Corning Ware, this product is a horrible substitute.World Kitchen bought the brand in the late 1990's, promptly ""redesigned"" the product, and shipped manufacturing overseas. WK is trading on the reputation of Corning Ware while offering a product that bears no resemblance to the original in versatility or durability.I'm switching over to Pyrex. It is an excellent product and manufacturing is still done in the U.S."
4,Great Value & Great Experience,"I bought this and it was 34 bucks with free super-saver shipping. I was like, what do I have to loose? Great price! It arrived VERY quickly but to my dismay, two pieces (both 2.5 qt containers) were broken! I called corningware and explained to them what happened. They quickly sent via Fed-Ex 2 replacement pieces. Overall, it still was a great buy and I am VERY happy!"
5,Grandson loves Birthday Gift,Grandson saw me prepare Thanksgiving Dinner using my set of French White CorningWare and immediately asked about it and thought he would like it for his Birthday.French
3,corningware set,This was a gift for my daughter and one piece was broken upon arrival. I opted to take a discount for the broken piece instead of having to pack it all up again to mail back.
4,given as a gift,I can not rate this product because I gave it as a gift. I have a comparable CorningWare bake and serve set that I love. Great for baking and tabletop serving.
5,Love It,"I just love my Corning Ware Set. Before I ordered this set from""Amazon"" my husband ordered one from another company. When I got it, it was broken and it cost more. Thank you ""AMAZON"" MY husband cannot order any more without my say so unless its from ""AMAZON""."
5,CorningWare French White 12-Piece Bake & Serve Set,"Honestly, I really do not care if this is ""the real"" Corningware or not. I bought this set to add to one I bought when I first moved to the US 10 years ago. I really only use them as serving dishes, for keeping things warm in the oven prior to serving, and, occasionally, in the oven for casseroles/stuffing etc. They are sturdy, look attractive, and clean up easily. They are perfect for my needs. The End."
3,Know what you're buying!,"Disregard the CorningWare name. It isn't the old, super-durable ceramic glass you know and love. It's just ceramic bakeware now. It'll work in the oven, but if you want to brown something on the stove top before transferring to the oven, look elsewhere. This cannot do it. Also, this particular set has no handles. That's a little odd. I'm all for style, but not at the loss of function.I've since picked up a set of real CorningWare from second hand stores. It's inexpensive and easy to find due to its popularity over the past few decades. Even heavily used pieces have cleaned up to flawless condition using a light, scratch-free cleanser such asBar Keeper's Friend Liquid Cleaner - 13 oz Bottleand gently wiping with a sponge.Although to be honest, if you're looking purely for oven usage, and don't mind not having handles, this set will function perfectly. It cooks great like all ceramics do, it just isn't as forgiving or as versatile as its predecessors."
2,Also Broken plus....,My set also arrived with two very broken bowls. They were double boxed. The outside shipping box was in fine shape. The inside box from CorningWare was all banged up. The damage was NOT done in shipping. Someone at the warehouse knew they were broken when packed into the second box. Amazon referred me to Corning and they shipped replacements right away with no hassel at all.I too was not aware this was not like the old Corning that could go from freezer to oven so I cannot not use for the purpose I bought them. It does however bake nicely and looks good on the table. The glass lids could use more of a lip and want to slide off at the worse possible moment. Overall not a good experience and will not purchase again.
1,too bad,"I ordered this, didn't arrive in time for Thanksgiving AND when it DID arrive, it was in a million pieces! It was not packaged well at all. This was NOT shipped from Amazon. Buy when shipped from Amazon with confidence."
2,Good product however...,"I bought this product from Target. It does everything I would expect in a bathroom cleaner and the fact that it is a green product made it very appealing. I will say the fumes spray kicked off were so strong I had to wear a face mask while cleaning and that did not stop the fumes from getting into my throat and nose which resulted in a sneezing/coughing/gagging fit. That being said I have suffered form allergies all my life and I am highly sensitive to certain aromas. I believe that this is a product that doesn't agree with me, though it does clean great. I didn't want to throw it away so I use the remainder of it to clean the toilet bowl (worked great). If you have medical issues like me I say use at your own risk."
1,"Cleans well initially, but tub is grimy again in about 2 days","With other bath cleaners I can usually go a week between cleanings. With Method, the bath looks horrible in 1-2 days after cleaning it. Since I have a life and don't plan to clean the bath that often, I'm looking for another product! I think I'll tryBabyGanics Scrub-a-Tub,Tub and Tile Cleaner, Unscented, 32 Fluid Ounce, which apparently helps the bath stay clean for a long time and is also natural/non-toxic.Update: BabyGanics works very well!"
4,Good natural alternative,"I like the idea of Method products: natural and biodegradable. I use this product on my tub every now and then. My tub is fairly clean because I also use a daily cleaner but I like to use something stronger sometimes. For this purpose it works well, but I don't feel it's strong enough for tougher jobs. I wish it had some of the ""no scrub required"" properties other brands have. The smell is ok."
5,Method products are great!,I have been so impressed with this product by Method. The scent is pleasing and the product works great.
3,Greenwashed,"I had bought this case when I started to switch to safer, more natural cleaners. This does work well and smells very pleasant. It just isn't nearly as ""natural"" and ""safe"" as method would lead people to believe. Ever notice how the ingredients list is never on the bottle?"
4,Great alternative to regular chemical cleaners,"Great alternative to regular chemical cleaners, which used to make me sick. This smells great and is just as effective in cleaning the bathrooms. I still use regular disinfectant/cleaner with bleach for the toilet bowl, but I have switched to this for the sinks, bathtubs and floor. This has made bathroom cleaning much more pleasant."
4,the green method......,"I have been slowing switching all of my families cleaning products over to Method products. They clean well, have nice, fresh scents instead of choke worthy chemical scents in most ""toxic"" cleaners, and come in very mod, clean line, eco friendly packaging. Method has made it easy being green.I gave the tub cleaner a 4 instead of 5 because it was a little too strong a scent for me, but it is still WAY better smelling than most commercial tub cleaners. The product does get a 5 for cleaning ability though, especially the ""ring around the bathtub"" on my old porcelain bath.4 stars!"
3,"I LOVE Method products, but...","Okay, so this is an ""okay"" tub & tile cleaner. I have a cleaning business, and I use all natural, not tested on animals, environmentally safe products as much as possible. I LOVE all the other Method products I use (Glass cleaner especially), but this just is not tough enough, even when used with a heavy-duty scrub brush.It just cannot compare with something chemical when cleaning a tough shower or tub. It's fine for maintenance on a generally clean shower or tub, but not one that has been neglected, especially on the soap scum. The smell is great, though, and I still use it as often as possible as a good alternative to burning my nose with the other stuff."
4,Long time user,"Like everyone has already said, this stuff smells great (NOT HARSH LIKE BLEACH AND OTHER CLEANERS) Cleans very well and I wont and don't use anything but the whole method line. The glass cleaner is great as well. Highly recommend!!!!!"
3,Jimmy Smith's Third Blue Note Album on CD,"~ This expensive import CD contains Jimmy's third Blue Note album (Blue Note 1525), his follow-up to ""A New Sound, A New Star - Jimmy Smith at the Organ Volumes One and Two"" (Blue Note Album 1512 & 1514). You can obtain the same material plus an additional 17 tracks for a lot less money on the Blue Note 2-CD setNew Sound New Star.~ The reason for the 3-star rating is not because of the music, but it is because of the value - why pay more money for less music, when Blue Note offers more music for less money. See my review ofNew Sound New Star"
2,Simplistic Evaluation,"Trying Hard is Not Good Enough is a great metaphor pertaining to evaluation and also is how I would judge this book. It's simplistic design will appeal to many social service administrators who need to be able to have data for their boards and funders, yet they still may never get to the theories behind the workings of the program and even if the program actually works as designed. This is just the decades old MBO (Management by Objective) for Human Services, and does not expand the science of evaluation. There are many better evaluation books out there that have expanded far beyond what Mr. Friedman posits as evaluation, which build on logic model frameworks and theory of change.RealWorld Evaluation: Working Under Budget, Time, Data, and Political ConstraintsEssentials of Utilization-Focused EvaluationPurposeful Program Theory: Effective Use of Theories of Change and Logic Models (Research Methods for the Social Sciences)"
3,Got what I needed and then was done...,"Interesting book, hits you over the head with the point. could have been more and less at same time."
5,Trying Hard is not good enough,"In New Zealand as social service providers, we are changing the accountable system to Result Base Accountability and this book gives all the details that is required to change to this system.It is easy to read and understand with humour throughout the book for people like me that can get bored so quickly when it is too complicated to read."
5,another superb recording,"I was ready to not be charmed by this third release and am pleased to announce how very wrong I was. Red Devil Dawn is his finest album todate. Start your listen anywhere, there's not a weak song among the 10."
3,The Emperor's New Jump Suit?,"When it comes to music, one thing's pretty certain: people hear what they want to hear. I see it often in press releases where up-and-coming bands want to be linked with, say, Archers of Loaf, but actually sound like HOOTIE.It seems people want to compare C.F.'s leader/singer E. Bachmann these days with Tom Waits, or Mr. Springsteen, but I don't see why nobody ever mentiones Neil Diamond. Well, N.D. isn't hip, folks.There are good tunes here, but they suffer from a certain sameness to these ears.... the vocals all seem to be delivered with the same level of intensity, in the same narrow range, with similar chord changes, similar melodies and themes. It's fairly simple music, delivered effectively. Now if only they'd do a cover of ""America"". Holy cow!"
4,Teacher's Grade: B,"As a 2nd grade teacher in an urban school district, I'm always looking for new series to excite the reluctant readers that are in my classroom. I bought this book with the hopes that it would stand the test of the classroom!Knife and Packer's first book in this new series is a mixed bag of tricks. The book's format is most similar to that of the original Magic School Bus series, where the narrative of the story is broken up with the inclusion of scientific facts.On the positive side are brief chapters with cliffhanger endings that are sure to get kids to want to turn to the next page. Also on the bright side is the wealth of science facts that accompany the story. Negatively, the science facts disrupt the flow of the story, and the story itself seems very forced.This is an engaging story that is sure to excite 2nd-4th grade boys, especially ones who like superheroes and space. I do wonder what will happen when they discover that the superhero has no super powers."
4,"Nice glasses, but order two to save yourself some trouble.","I gave four stars because they are very nice but should be tempered glass for safety and to prevent waste of all the broken glasses. I ordered one set and when it arrived it had a flaw. A bubble in the rim of one glass popped when I touched it, so I ordered a second set and that one had one chipped and one cracked glass in it. I mixed and matched a complete set and returned the damaged one. The design of these glasses is very nice. They are heavy, clear, and shiny. The rims are thick, so I am not afraid they will break in my hand when washing or snap off in my mouth when I take a sip. Some have an imperfection like a slight lump on a rim or tiny air bubble. I would buy again despite the breakage problems."
5,"Sturdy, nice looking glasses","Got these for entertaining and they are great! Heavy bottomed, so very sturdy, and they look really nice. I'll likely buy the tall ones in the future."
5,great,My wife just loves these glasses. Arrived in good time and well packed . no damage at all as some said.
3,Poor packaging,"The glasses are fine, nice and heavy at the bottom. However, they were very poorly packaged and arrived with two broken and glass all over the box and the other glasses."
3,Add some packing materials,"Every glass arrived broken. The glasses are not individually wrapped. The box they were in was not padded or very thick. The box of glasses was then put into the amazon box with no packing material. No wonder everything arrived. Broken what a waste of beautiful glasses. They processed my refund very quickly though which was the only upside. Pam Seattle, WA"
4,Great Rocks Glasses,I really like these glasses for mixed drinks. They have a nice weight to them and look good. They're also good for non-alcoholic drinks during meals.
4,great,exactly what i wanted. the price was right and the glasses are terrific; glad i found them on this site
1,ok... but broken,I love the glasses but i didnt realize one was chipped until after id ripped the box. Very dissapointing since you have to return the whole set when this happens. It wasnt worth $3 for the broken glass for me to drag all my kids to the post office to return.
1,Broken glasses,Recived a package of broken glass due to poor packing by the seller and the usual brutal handling by UPS.
5,The last neighborhood in town,"One of the greatest 80's movies ever with some of the greatest lines i ever heard. My favorite scene is with Kent(Michael Wincott) who is so stoned he doesn't know what planet he's on. Then there are all the callers; Debbie, Chet, Ralph, and especially the woman who says Ted Bundy could be living next door on the porch, watching T.V. eating potato chips and i wouldn't know it. Strange Air. My favorite line: "" Ralph I am curious, how do you dial a phone with a straightjacket on."" Eric Bogosian is so underated it is not funny. This is one of Oliver Stone's best. One year after Wall Street, he gave us this mind blowing film. Awesome"
4,the sharp and lonesome voices without faces,"Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian) is a tortured talk-radio host who feeds off the moral cesspool of his audience. His caustic worldview consumes his show and life and leads to a dazzling showdown between each; the pollution of his degenerate listeners ultimately being his own to claim. With creeping tracking shots and the camera circling Champlain like a vulture watching its prey, the main set of the radio station is kept alive. Bogosian gives a mesmerizing performance; the sharp and lonesome voices without faces over the airwaves strike a deep chord."
4,Talkin' about radio,"Where do I begin?Oliver Stone certainly reached deep into the corner of his brain for this one and the results were superb.Eric Bogosian is at his finest here & will keep you gripped the whole way.Based on the stage play (where the whole thing is the on-air parts), and the book: Talked to Death: The Life and Murder of Alan Berg, the outside scenes with his wife & girlfriend are Stones creation.The callers hit Barry with the most diverse subjects & they will either piss you off or have you rolling on the floor laughing.It also gives the viewer a look into the business of radio. Many people think it's all just one big party there, but as you will soon see, it has a very serious money making element.A good purchase for your personal collection & worth a re-watch now & again."
4,A Bit Dated But Still Worth Watching,"Eric Bogosian is incredible in his fierce creation of ""Barry Champlaign"", a glib but angry Dallas talk show host. The movie is said to be inspired by the story of Denver radio personality Alan Berg who met a similar fate to Barry's but Bogosian's character owes much more in looks and style to Howard Stern. The film has many good performances throughout with Alec Baldwin doing some of his best work in the supporting role of Barry's boss. Set in a time before the internet changed mass media forever the film is a bit dated and though well acted the character Kent it truly a product of the 80's."
5,Talk Radio,"This is a must have for all movie lovers and critics. Its a great story line and even better acting.... It is a movie that no matter what time in our lives that you watch it, it will always identify with current events."
5,Very suspenseful,"This was a great film. Oliver Stone's over-the-top style was perfect for this style of movie.Eric Bogosian is a Howard Stern/like talk radio host that you know is going to get killed. As the viewer, you just do not know how it will happen. I liken this film to a horror/suspense film. He plays a fascinating role since his characte ris likeable but also very detestable. Since you know he is going to get killed, every (regularly) acerbic caller or heated debater becomes a potential candidate for a murderer.The majority of the movie takes place iniside a radio station. While that might sound boring, Stone's style of close ups, loud volume talking, etc (which was so annoying in ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""The Doors"") becomes the perfect mechanism to make this small film... effectively larger.This is an overlooked gem."
2,class project,This movie was a class project. This is not a movie I would suggest buying for entertainment.
2,"Good Play, Mediocre Movie","It's nigh on impossible to take certain stage plays and make them into good cinema; this is one.The ultimate breakdown is not in the plot. It's not in the fleshing out to fill almost two hours. It's the incredibly bad accents and characterization attempts by the callers. Every one of them sounds like a escapee from a high school production with even the dumbest morons having to mouth pre-meditated, and literate dialogue. I didn't believe a one of them, and several sounded like the same actor trying to portray a different rube.I'd recommend going to see a live revival of the play somewhere."
3,A Must for the Rubber Stamper's Library,"Being new to rubber stamping and mixed media art, I found Nancy's book to be great learning tool. Not only did I learn many of the products available and what can be done with them, but I was truly inspired by her projects and techniques. Thanks to Nancy I am now well on my way to being a rubber addict."
1,Some cheese with that whine?,"What a drab CD. If I wanted to go to sleep, I'd count sheep instead of listening to this poser group drone through an album"
4,"""Fred""","The third reviewer Fred can't spell poseur right, and so I wouldn't trust his reviews. This is a great album."
3,"Fun, but...silly...","Hit The Lights is fun pop punk. It's not going to break any barriers, and it won't be in your CD player for a while, but it's a fun listen once in a while. As my girlfriend would say, it's 'cute'.The one problem I had was with some of the lyrics. Especially the song 'Bodybag', the lyrics 'you're gonna need a bodybag, I'll break bones you never knew you had"", etc. just sound so damn silly coming from someone who sounds like he spends a lot of time getting stuffed into lockers at his local junior college. He just sounds too...what's the word...'girly', I guess.Still, it's a fun record, and worth listening to a few times.= J"
3,A rounded explanation,"I have been working wood for a little over a year and find I enjoy the hand tools far more than the power tools. This book is an excellent and easily accessible read that gives a broad overview of the process right from logging to finished product with valuable nuggets of information for the hand tool worker. The Kindle version suffers, however, from a lack of pictures, which would display well on the iPad Kindle."
2,just did not like it.,It has some good information but just did not like it. Was not what i was expecting it to be about.
1,Not what I was looking for,"Need to have more ""How To"" books for the Kindle. The book was all words and no photos. My feeling is photos put across more than words can."
2,Images don't show,"The price was right (free) but my Kindle e-reader program on my pc does not display any of the illustrations. This may be user error on my part or my program is not set up correctly. No problem with the text, just wanted the pictures too."
3,"good, if you are a total BEGINNER in capoeira","the strategy is less moves and stuff though a better explanation (slow, repeated). Good for the music explanation (few other videos do it). Good for VERY BASIC capoeiristas with no instructor, but a bit ""poor"" on the quantity of moves, kicks, takedowns. I was a bit disappointed just on that. If you are doing capoeira at an average level, it's not worth buying it. Instead if you are about to start off capoeira, I suggest you buy this dvd. The price anyway is too high for a ""copy"" style dvd (purple layer: are you serious?)."
2,Golding Kushner book less than helpful,"I purchased this book because it was highly recommended by the Velo Cardio Facial Syndrome (VCFS) Foundation. I was told that it was ""the bible"" for helping develop speech in VCFS kids. There were only a few pages on VCFS and the thrust of those pages was an argument against the use of sign. On a personal level I am the mother of a VCFS child, and am acquanted with 100's of other VCFS parents, nearly all of whom use sign WITH GREAT SUCCESS with our children.I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a layperson in speech pathology. I would not recommend it to anyone who has a child that is non verbal as a result of anything other than a cleft palate. The book only appropriate for Speech Language Pathologists or Developmental Pediatricians. I can't imagine anyone else finding it helpful. For that matter our Speech Language Pathologist didn't find it helpful either."
5,The Pain and Poetry of Childhood,"As always, Jane Gardam writes with an unbeatable combination of poetry, humanity and dazzling wit. Here her subject is not the agonized adolescence she has dealt with elsewhere, but rather the small events in a younger child's life. A rural setting brings opportunities for colloquial speech, much of it very funny indeed; but Gardam never condescends to her characters, young or old. The writer is wise enough, and skillful enough, not to let her grownup perspective come between her and a complete identification with her child protagonist. Don't look for grand passions or earth-shattering revelations. This is an intimate book that illuminates the everyday with warmth, charm and intelligence."
2,Returning Phone,Callers complained of clarity. LED is very difficult to see.Handset volume is not convenient and must be reset with each call. END
1,Glad to see it's not just me - this phone is a loser,"I was shopping for a new phone today to replace this ..., and stumbled across these reviews. Glad to see it's not just me who is having problems with this phone. It looked like a great deal when I bought it, but mine suffers from all the same problems outlined by numerous reviewers already. It ""loses"" the handset, even when you pick it up right from the base - frequently, you have to hang it up again to let it reset before you can answer the phone. When the power goes out, even for a second, you have to pull the power cord out and remove the backup battery to get it working again, erasing all your messages and settings - so much for having a backup battery! Also, the sounds quality is poor compared to my cordless Lucent and Panasonic phones.Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this phone."
2,Feature rich - performance poor,"I have owned this phone about 5 months now. I have had complaints from others about outbound sound quality at times. May biggest frustration is that when the handset is on the base and a call comes in, if you pick up the handset and try to answer too quickly, the handset seems unable to find the base and I end up having to answer/conduct the business call on the speakerphone, at least until I can hang up the handset and let it ""resest"" itself, synching up the security code I would guess. The answering machine is very versatile, but the battery backup doesn't seem to save messages when the power goes out, only the memory dial numbers! What good does that do?Would keep looking...."
2,Not what I was looking for,I am often looking for good novels. After reading the reviews of this book I gave it a try. The plot and twists seemed evident by about the third chapter. Characters seemed one dimensional and the solutions were obvious and sticky sweet. Different strokes for different folks I guess. At least it was not violent or offensive.
3,Pieces of the Heart,"This is a wonderful story, the first novel I have read by Karen White. I am sold, and will read many more of her novels. it's an intriguing love story, dealing with issues of guilt that are very hard to put aside for the main character. Also, it is not a typical ""sappy"" romance; and it has a happy ending, my type of story!"
1,Pieces of the Heart,"I had not read any Southern Novel before and while looking through Southern Living Magazine I saw a review of such a book. After reading this book I went to Amazon and looked at all the Southern authors, and started ordering books by these authors of which Karen White was one. This bookis an easy read and with a bunch of characters that touch each other but you have to wait until the end to solve the puzzle that are the lives of these people. I loved this book and I hope you do. Maybe more so if you are from the South."
1,Unbearable,"This book was so pathetic and horrid that I am embarrassed to admit that I even finished it. Stilted, amateurish, predictable, and laughable in its lack of depth, I don't believe I've ever finished a novel this poor, and the only reason I did was to find out if I had guessed every detail of the (ridiculously unbelievable) storyline correctly by the third chapter (I did). I usually lend books I've purchased to friends but am too embarrassed to pass this wimp along; in fact I was debating on whether to pitch it vs. put it in my Goodwill basket until I saw that some other readers did actually enjoy it.As with actors trying to save a poor movie, I felt sorry for the characters trying to come alive in this dreadful story, and I will never read about diaries, loons or heart transplants again without blushing, they were so badly abused. I would not have been surprised if this book had started with ""It was a dark and stormy night...."""
5,2 handset cordless phone,The phone arrived in a very timely manner and the sound quality is wonderful. I love having the extra handset.
1,Like Sandpaper,"I got a set of Martex 250 threadcount (60%cotton 40%poly) for Christmas and they are terrible sheets. I washed them two times, thinking the rough feel would go away. It's still there. I don't use these sheets now and have recently contacted Westpoint Services (the makers of Martex sheets) to see if they can offer me a return or exchange. I honestly think there is a defect with these sheets, they are so rough."
3,Martex Sheets,"I have another set of sheets that is 250 TC, also made of 60% cotton, 40% polyster, that is super soft and comfortable, so I thought I was getting something if not exactly the same, then similar. I read the reviews that the sheets are scratchy after I made the purchase, but before it arrived, so you can imagine my apprehension. Well, I'd have to agree that the sheets are not so comfortable, but the price was much better than anything else out there, and they certainly seem strong, so at least we'll get a lot of use out of them. Hopefully as time goes by and we use them more, they'll get smoother."
4,Handy for those with an interest in Otsego!,The title says it all as this book is an abstract of obituaries from newspapers in Otsego County from 1808 to 1875. The abstract contains little more than the name and age of the individual who died and the date it appeared in which newspaper. There's no other biographical or genealogical information on the subject who died and in that respect this works best as a guide to find that original newspaper. That's the good news. The bad news is that the newspapers of the time usually carried little that might be helpful to a researcher. As a result this title is mostly of use to those researchers working on Otsego and its environs who have run into a brick wall and are hoping for a breakthrough.
4,Informative,Purchased this because I had an English 1B essay based upon manners and this helped me to get the information I was looking for.
2,Just not the same Johnstone quality,"I have been a ""In the Ashes"" fan for years, but this last ""Attempt in the Ashes"" falls far short of what I have come to expect of the series. It is time for Mr. Johnstone to spend more time on the series or bring it to a closure."
2,Time to end the series???,"This book seems to be little more than to bridge the gap between his last book, and the next in the series. Mr. Johnstone again resorts to taking entire sections from his earlier books, and quoting them verbatim - this time with the pretext of the villian studying the writings of a war correspondent. Although I enjoyed this series, it has become clear to me that Mr. Johnstone is tiring of writing it. Each new book has less action, and more ""flashbacks"". In my opinion, he should finally put an end to this series - as he recently did to the ""Eagles"" western series, though it was much shorter than this one.If you're collecting the series, go ahead and get this book. Just don't expect any action in the read."
3,"Johnstone's Weakest ""Ashes"" Book to Date","I am a huge fan of the ""Ashes"" series and, due to its great reread value, own all the books. But yhis is Johnstone's worst book in the series. The beginning looks promising but the last half of the book is uninteresting. This is mainly due to the reprinting of scenes from ""Triumph"" and rewriting a scene that also appeared in ""Triumph."" Unlike the other reviewer's I do not want this series to end but hope Mr. Johnstone makes a better effort for ""Warriors from the Ashes."" This is his most popular series and I would think it would be profitalbe if the books were of good quality."
2,What Happened to the Adventure,"I have followed the ""Ashes"" series from Book One. There was adventure, action, a feeling of like purpose righting wrongs. A quality series. But the last book leaves much to be desired from a trusted author. Maybe its time to end the series, devote the energy to the old quality of giving the reader a true action series."
2,Not a true Johnstone,"I understand Bill died, but this book was written by someone who is an idiot. They changed charecters personalities, and added language that makes the characters sound idiotic. I was highly disapointed in the book. I will continue on with the series, with hope that the new author (nephew) gets his head out of his back side."
2,Tyranny in the Ashes,i have read all of mr. johnstone ashes series and this is by far his worst book. it was poorly edited and very repeatative of his pervious books. the book i bought was also missing 40 pages and it was new! i will still be a johnstone fan and will continue to purchase his books. Hopefully his next book is alot better.
5,Shortest path to Fitness,"Functional Fitness provides a 'fitness in a suitcase' approach. These exercises turn waiting in line (at the airport, grocery store, or at the coffee shop) into opportunities to become healthier. This allows people the convenience of using the exercises anywhere and anytime they choose without the aid of cumbersome props and equipment. This is the first commonsense handbook containing the extremely popular Pilates principles and exercises that can be done: sitting, standing, lying down, walking, and even in meetings, in traffic, or on flights. It offers a foundation of exercises that can be practiced 'beyond the mat.' Companies concerned with their employees' well being and interested in increasing productivity can now utilize Larkin Barnett's Desk Freedom Program to accomplish this goal."
4,Decent Fulci,"This isn't the best Fulci, but decent for his work. The story holds up, with an ending that, although not entirely effective, makes a point and should make you think. Makes you feel for the girl. Being the '80s, of course there's gore and nudity and, being Italian, a little more nudity and gore. The viewer isn't quite sure who the killer really is at times. The duck-quack voice of the killer may make some people laugh or put them off from this film, and one or two of the gore sequences may offend some, but what do you expect from this type of film?The blu-ray is miles above the DVD in quality and there's more picture included in the frame. I thought some of the flesh tones were a little bright, but I'm not sure if that's supposed to be that way since the other colors looks fine."
5,Don't get tortured by this duckling,"This duck don't give a f#$%! We've got lots of blood, nudity, and a Donald Duck sounding slasher. Just some nice trashy cinema for the fellas. Nothing too deep, just high impact violence and sex like only Fulci can give you.Lots of rippin quack quackLots of slashin quack quackSleaze quack please quack don't hold backBrutality in all its shocking beauty"
3,"a classic gore movie, By one of the great master's","A great film to add to your horror collection, destined to have a cult collectible status like its now deleted private release laser disc counterpart. By Fulci a great horror master. The story follows a sick serial killers who speaks like a duck, in order to keep an alias, his victims are women who he savages with very sharp blade's starting at there groin and folowing up through there torso. A very sick film, but a must for any horror fan..."
3,a decent slasher flick,"So out of Maniac,Prowler and NY Ripper I've come to the conclusion that NY ripper is the top contender at 3.5 stars.Now obviously two things are needed to make these movies a success on is nudity and over the top kills.This movie has enough of both to satisfy most.Maniac left me baffled as how can anybody think it's ground breaking stuff. (maybe back then but this movie is only a year older and much better as far as I'm concerned)And Prowler was not even half the movie I thought it would be.That being said this is decent enough to merit three and a half stars.It's the closest to what I think a clasic sleazy slasher flick should be like.Of course it's all objective as the varying review ratings will atest it's just this one had more of what I have come to expect from an 80's slasher flick."
2,Crapola,"Even gore hounds will be disappointed with this boring, laughable flick from the ultimate Italian hack, Lucio Fulci, who bears the full responsibility for this mess since he wrote it as well. If you can watch the murder scenes without laughing from the duckman's voice, your are stronger than I. It's just downright awful this film, and it's obvious that Fulci had some major problems with women."
1,Duck you Suckers!,"This is one of those 70's films that captures the urban stagnation of New York and brings absolutely no point to our intelligence. In trying to hop on the slasher band wagon created by ingenious American horrors, Fulci falls flat on his face, namely because there is no story or suspense and what a goof for a killer, a duck of all people! Avoid this at all costs, even the porn theater scene is dull because of the ugly naked women that look like drug users......"
3,"mickey mouse, DONALD DUCK!!!!!!","NEW YORK RIPPER is Lucio Fulci's 'odd man out' film of his gore stint between ZOMBIE and THE BEYOND. Part Italian crime drama, part paint-by-numbers giallo, NEW YORK RIPPER is effective for being a precursor to the superior Bill Lustig film, MANIAC. The story is relatively simple and if you read the other customer reviews, you can get the jist. I enjoy this film a great deal-my reason being is that NEW YORK RIPPER lies somewhere between the seediness of a Jess Franco film and the sleaziness and misogyny of Joe D'Amato, although some (gasp) XXX scenes would have made this a sick flick. Which is a good thing. The ending is understandable but still remains as that makes one say 'huh' to themselves. Maybe I should watch Joe D'Amato's PORNO HOLOCAUST again."
2,wouldn't watch it again,"well,this is a strange film.the way it sounded and looked had a TVmovie feel to it.you know,cheesy,generic 80's music and low productionvalues.yet,it definitely is not a TV movie.it's the first(and likelylast)film i have seen from Italian director Lucio Fulci,who also wrotethe film.it's not that i hated the movie.it has it's merits.for onething,the killer has an interesting(though never explained or put intocontext)quirk.and there were several viable suspects.until the veryend,i wasn't sure of the killer's identity.any time i'm left guessingto the end,that's a positive.i also thought the acting was pretty goodfrom the principals.what i could have down without are the longlingering shots of women being mutilated.that just doesn't do anythingfor me.ultimately this is what sinks the movie in my mind into the'would not watch again' category. none of the positive aspects canovercome this.for me,Lo squartatore di New York AKA The New York Ripperis a 2/5"
3,Not by far,Even if you're a big Lucio Fulci fan you can easily skip this one.On the other hand... this movie features some of the coolest duck sounds in the history of film making.
2,"If you like your horror really dark and weird, then this is for you","Although the Italian horror/slasher genre of the 1970's includes many films that aren't exactly Disney-esque, I found ""The New York Ripper"" to be a particularly unpleasant ride. Lurid violence, depressing cinematography (90% of the film is dark and grainy), and choppy (no pun intended) storytelling made this more of an ordeal than the guilty pleasure I expected. Check out ""Strip Nude For Your Killer"" and ""The Case of the Bloody Iris"" for more polished, entertaining examples of the ""giallo"" form. That is, unless you really, really want to see a movie about a serial killer who quacks like a duck."
2,"Not 'depraved', just a bit dull.","And badly dubbed. This was my first Fulci movie, and I know they're SUPPOSED to be badly dubbed, but I found I couldn't even enjoy this one according to the 'so bad it's good' idea. I became concious as I watched that I was wasting precious minutes of my life, and began reaching for the fast forward button.The level of the film is pitched so low that it's really not worth bothering about arguments of depravity of misogyny - I just simply could never take it that seriously. Maybe it's an acquired taste - but in order to acquire it I would have to spend even more time watching this stuff, and life's just too short.For real film about the gutters of New York, with luscious cinamatography, I'd still rather watch Taxi Driver."
2,What The Duck?,"the acting was awful. the gore scenes are lame & the editing is bad. but i could get passed all of that because the plot was pretty good. however, the whole duck thing lost me. any good qualitys this film may have had was ruined by the duck angle."
2,Not a Fulci classic.,"After waiting forever to see this film, perhaps I was too built up. Lots of Fulci fans list this film as one of his best. However I think it's nowhere near the level of City of The Living Dead or The Beyond. Not even as good as House by the Cemetery IMO. You've been warned."
3,"""QUACK!! .. QUACK!!"" ... ??????",... Honestly!! QUACK!! QUACK!!! .. How novel!! Whatever hapend to the good old heavy panting and drooling for heaven's sake?!!!
4,Ripping Entertainment,"The New York Ripper is an exceptionally violent portrayal of a murderer loose in a sleaze ridden NYC.As such it is a fantastic film particularly if a) you love early '80s NYC as a setting, b) neon-generated sleaze, and c) a dated and cheap electro funk score. Oh, and it also helps if you admire poor dubbing.Anchor Bay's DVD transfer is fine- the odd blemish but considering the film's age and type, thoroughly commendable.Exploitation fans will be delighted while this film should be avoided by moral crusaders."
4,Great few hours,"Yukikaze is a great, deep, and interesting look into a conflict fought a universe away. Showing the perspective of the largely ignorant public, and that of the pilots and machines fighting in 'Fairy', so in essence two distinct sides of a coin. The show has flaws, such as the fluidity of the story and lack of real plot development. It does have awesome action sequences, with Yukikaze itself being the most ridiculous weapon I've ever seen in a tv show (besides Gurren Lagann... ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH!)Really I would give this show a 3.5/5, with 2.5 being perfectly average."
2,Read the book-pass on the anime,"The anime version of yukikaze is not on the same level as the novels. The anime seems too rushed and would make no sense if one hasnt read the books. Vol. 1 has two episodes- part one tries to minimize the plot of the first book, episode two is a chapter from the second. The characters do not bear much resemblance from the novels and yukikaze has none of the draw that the books have. Dissapointed."
1,Seeing the connectors would be a good start,"You know, if the people that list merchandise like this would give a photo of the plugs in the back, it would help a lot! I don't care what the front case looks like...I am shopping for something that can take RCA input and convert it to 75-ohm output. This only says ""accepts multiple F-Type plugs""...well dandy...does this mean that you can connect three incoming 75-ohm signals to one 75-ohm TV? Does it have RCA inputs also? A drawing, photo or other would be nice...until then, forget it!This is like describing a kitchen stove to someone, and saying ""and it gets hot enough to cook food, too""...way too much of the wrong (superfluous) information guys...try again."
4,Good for the Basics,"Simple needs phone...none of the bells and whistles if you don't want them. It works well, the battery lasts and it gets the calls made. No caller ID or fancy features, but if you just want a cordless phone that doesn't pick up random signals and works when you need it, this is it!"
2,SOAKED IN UNREALITY,"Maybe Simic's ""The World Doesn't End"" is a delight and a surprise as the jacket blurb says, but this collection of poems is full of frustration, despair, emptiness, and ugliness. The poems celebrate the significance of the empty, the significance of the impossible desire, the significance of endless misery, unmitigated pain, and this thing here. There are somewhat successful poems about unsuccessful living, but all these poems drain the spirit. They soak the soul in unreality. This is a book of poems that reveals itself in self-inflicted, unconscious, emotional pain."
2,you get what you pay for,"I didn't use this right away so it was out of warranty when the tape player broke after very limited use. The CD player works but the unit doesn't have very good sound--very little bass even with BASS BOOST. I don't even like a lot of bass, but it is even too tinny for me. Not Amazon's fault, I guess you can't expect much for the price."
3,A book one quickly outgrows.,"A pretty book with beautiful, clear graphics and simple, interesting explanations. Not ""advanced,"" however, and only a bit more detailed than its primer, Skywatching. A very good children's book."
1,very smal,ordered this item and it was not as big as i thought it would be was very un happy will be returning this item the pic makes it look bigger then it is if you put it on your neck you wouldnt be able to see it
5,Soft and Hard Blues - a Great Album,"Larry is one of the best Christian artists ever and this may be his best album. Great blues through and through - sometimes simple but well done, other times psychadelic.Frank Black named the first Pixies album after the line ""C'mon Pilgrim, you know He loves ... stop acting like an idget"" in the song ""Watch What You Are Doing"""
5,Still a favorite blues album,"Larry Norman was a trailblazer in the area of Christian music. He is attributed to be the first down the trail of Christian rock and in this album, the first in Christian blues. This album was a tribute Larry gave to his roots in the blues music he loved and that influenced his work when very young. It is an earthy, emotional, powerful retelling of Pilgrim's Progress in the blues genre. Solid, sometimes funny, lyrics that make you pause and think with blazing riffs to please any blues fan. It is spiritual dynamite for the sleepy soul that has grown cynical in the search for meaning. The MP3 download has 3 bonus tracks as well, all of which fit well with the rest of the album. This is a favorite blues album of mine Christian or otherwise."
5,Another Norman Masterpiece,"Larry Norman / Something New Under The Son - 1977: This tells the story of a lad who has given up, and then finds redemption. This album is sometimes serious and sometime hilarious, sometimes soft and sometimes full out Rockin'. This is a GREAT album. This one deserves a Sixth Star."
3,Granny the Pag,"I liked the book ""Granny the Pag"", it was not very exiting but it had a good story. I liked the conflict between the charicters. Theplot was also good.The worst part of the book was when they are in greece, its so boring. The best parts are when her and her granny are fighting.The story elements that were most vivid to me were, when they are at her house. They described everything about it. I also liked how they described ""the pag"". They told about what she would wear and what she would do to be called a pag. ""Granny the Pag"" is a pretty good book, I think you will like it."
5,Both instructional and entertaining!,"If you are interested in becoming a professional assistant, this is a must read. It defines all the skills you'll need to be successful, gives a historical and future look at the profession, and includes humorous anecdotes that will keep you entertained. The paradox is that it is both an instruction manual and a page turner. The author's realistic approach can inspire those who were meant to be a successful professional assistant. As a former NY personal assistant and current certified Microsoft Office Specialist Master Instructor supporting PA's, my specific interest in reading the book was to learn more about the technology challenges professional assistants face. Not only did I discover an author who has undeniable expertise, but one with a sense of purpose to help others succeed in this extremely competitive area. While many people in the business hoard information, Bonnie demonstrates a refreshing collaborative approach."
5,The Ultimate Assistant,Bonnie's book really gives great insight into becoming a CA. The book was a quick read and I read it from cover to cover in a day. Although not a CA I am in a high ranking position within my corporation and can relate to some of the instances. It is certainly an inspiration if you stive to becoming a CA. Lots of helpful hints and tips.
4,a favorite for my 12 month old,A very sweet book for my 12 month old. Its one of his favorites. The sentences are short. the pictures are simple not too much to take in for this age. He can point and we can talk about it before he goes on to the next page. And he loves the rhyming. The book is everything we expected it to be. The cover was in good condition. The inside had no bent pages. It did seem to take longer than I expected to receive this book though.
3,Broken pills,"I would not be surprised if a few pills are broken but this bottle was FULL of broken pills. The packaging by Source Naturals is not sufficient at all. The product itself is fine, panax ginseng is great although you need to take 6 pills a day to get their advertised amount."
4,I have asthma and I see some improvement in lung function!,Read somewhere in a study where mice were fed 2 grams of Red Ginseng and had better lung function in two weeks. Not sure if it is any help in humans but my lung function did slightly improve when I was using it for a couple of weeks.I'm not taking it everyday now anyways because of lack effectiveness after daily use but I'm going to start taking it starting February regularly for 2 weeks to see if there is any more improvement.The latest shipment I got tasted like they were wheat supplements then Ginseng hence the deduction of one star I hope I got the right product but who knows.
5,Danzig in all his glory!!,"I've had this video since it's release. It has the uncensored videos to ""Devil's Plaything,"" ""Killer Wolf,"" ""I'm the One,"" (this is the one where Glenn wrestles a crocodile - really cool!) and ""Her Black Wings."" It runs approximately 25 minutes, as compared to the 40 minute running time of the first Danzig home video (which features the uncensored version of the original ""Mother"" video as banned by MTV!). The video also contains Glenn Danzig reading an abridged version of a verse in Milton's ""Paradise Lost,"" which happens to be my favorite poem ever written. I give this video 5 stars! Check it out!"
5,Great for those able to sit and LISTEN to the tracks,"This guy is a real talent. I had the fortune of coming across him and DJ Spooky at a free concert in NYC. I only had time to stay for Colorform, but he was amazing. I was in my own little world, listening to the ""scenarios"" he created with the records, and would occasionally smile, and then just shake my head in wonderment at the genius with which he wove such incongruous beats, sounds, words, etc. I then went out and bought this CD. It's really terrific. I'd just like to hear more from from this guy!"
4,Great for Outlining and Briefing,"I found this book immensely helpful for briefing for class. It doesn't take the place of reading the casebook material, but helps to clarify the big picture, particularly if you're having trouble understanding a case. I also used it as a topic guide when I started outlining -- the expanded table of contents works perfectly as a guide for your outline, especially when you're a 1L and you're not really sure exactly how to DO an outline. However, be careful if you use it to study -- I found a few inaccuracies in the material. Mostly they involved switching the Restatements around, and giving you the wrong number. Other than that, it's a good inexpensive book to help get you through the first year."
5,Legalines: Contracts: Adaptable to 5th Edition of Murphy,"A necessity for any 1st year law student, Legalines Contracts for the Murphy casebook is a godsend for students. Beside outlining each case in the Murphy casebook and making complicated fact patterns crystal-clear, this book places all the cases in outline form. Students can read the cases in context of the entire course, connecting how each case fits into an overview of Contract law. Easy to read and filled with only necessary detail, this book is a must for any student using the Murphy casebook."
4,Great bang for the buck!,"Excellent design and pretty easy to assemble. The only downfall to this item is during assembly do not place too much force on the bolts as the item can crack pretty easy (only at the bolts) due to the nature of the metal itself. Other than that I must say for this is the best design and price point for a chiminea I have ever seen. The 360 degree range of heat is great for guest and of course since it is not a typical mexican chiminea (clay type), you do not have to worry about the chiminea cracking and killing your whole deck if not worse. I would highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a nice and effective source of outdoor heat."
2,"It'll get you through, but that's about it","I bought the HP Pavilion 6345US in mid 2007 and it's turned out to be so-so, at best, compared my HP 4150US ran so great since 2005. But, the 6345 since then has turned out to be relatively a disappointment. It runs really hot, even you load it clean with XP or Vista - SATA drivers on XP are a must - and it performs very mediocre. If you want something to write emails and browse the internet, then this is for you. Anything more than that, you're going to have to deal with occasional Windows stumbling and stirring, as well having something akin to a plugged in George Foreman Grill in your lap."
3,Looks great but performs slow.,"I own this model from HP. One thin g I will have tp say the new line of HP laptops look so sleey and nice. I love the look. However, the computer boots really slow. Part of it may be because of Vista. I have this model with 2 GB RAM, but it still takes a very long time to boot. I have seen Dell laptops with similar RAM work much fater. Other than that the laptop works pretty well. It has built in blue tooth, webcam, wireless, which are all great features. But overall 3 stars!"
2,Sad and disappointing,"I looked forward to reading this book for some time but only recently had the chance but it was sad and disappointing. The disappointment came from the thin writing -- from a writer who has had such a rich a varied background. Endless repetitions of phrases (He said he was there and not there; he said I was his wife; I felt no guilt). Repetitions of situations, so on. This is a 20 page monologue carried on 20 times -- and with none of the details that one would like to hear from this very accomplished writer.What was it like working at the New Yorker all those years? What was it like to interview and work with people like John Huston, Francois Truffaut, Charlie Chaplin, Oona O'Neil, Frederico Fellini, so on.This book, this writer, needed an editor if anyone did.But a sequel would be welcome by me -- one that tells the other Lillian Ross story/memoir. This 'wife's lament' is, well, not a very poetic one and not one that commends Lillian Ross as a raconteur."
1,I couldn't finish this dull repetitive book.,"I make no moral remarks about the relationship described by Ross. I just found the book to be one of the worst I have ever tried to read. I finally stopped reading this dull, repetitive story by a woman who writes horribly, in my opinion."
3,Learned a lot about the New Yorker,"Not the greatest book, but learned about the New Yorker. Felt excluded from their true relationship. Wonder what her other books are like."
2,Love's blind spots,"How can Ross claim that William Shawn never knowingly hurt anyone? Surely his wife would disagree - and so did this reader. Ross's unfathomable sycophantic treatment of current New Yorker editor Tina Brown seems self-serving and needless. More on the brilliant Shawn, and more emotional honesty (Ross's) would have helped this strangely withholding account."
4,The New Yorker revisited,A great insight into one of America's best and longest running magazines. A great love story between 2 of the magazine's prominent & faithful employees.
3,pickling salt,I am afraid I really can not rate this product yet. I purchased it for next years canning of cucumbers out of my garden.
5,Gran herramienta,"Esta Biblia es una gran herramienta de estudio. La información adicional proporciona el contexto historico tan necesario para entender lo que se lee. Los personajes importantes tienen una pequena biografía y nos ayuda a obtener una figura global del personaje mencionado. Al final de la Biblia hay una amplia concordancia que es definitivamente de gran beneficio. Creo que para el estudiante serio, esta Biblia sera una gran herramienta."
3,Flawless? Don't think so!,"Is it me, or is there something wrong with this plot? Let me get this straight: the Kayser Soze character sets up the whole thing just to kill the only guy who can positively identify him. When this whole ordeal is over, he promptly makes up a bogus story (a story exposed as a lie about three minutes after he leaves the police station) so that now, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. They have his mugshot,they have his prints on file, and he is probably captured by forty or fifty police cameras!Is there a hole in the plot, or is this Kayser Soze guy just the biggest screw-up in movie history?"
2,Alexander no longer so Great,Charles Alexander seems to be in a slump himself - this book is a pale shadow of his fierce McGraw and Cobb bios. The info about the era on and off field is there but the writing is hardly compelling.
5,Timeless,"Time and again I go back to this album. The music is uplifting, enchanting, and spiritual to me. My favorite is ""Yellow Trotter"" with the sounds of nature coming in a close second.Once, years ago, I had the opportunity to see them in concert. They are delightful to see in person and at work. Hopefully they shall tour again.A must for lovers of world music, any music, or if you have never heard music... start here.M..."
3,Does not fit all cars it says it does,"I ordered this part because it was the cheapest I could find, and got quick shipping straight from amazon, that was great. Downside is that when it arrived I realized that while it literally FITS on my car (1997 Chevrolet Corvette)the sensor cannot operate because the rotating center piece turns clockwise instead of counter-clockwise (with the throttle blade.)"
3,wonderer in search,"PORTAL is an adult male quest tale, reminiscent of those computer games of which boys are so fond. Quite lyrical in places, filled with mysterious happenings & imminent danger. It is also in need of an editor.PORTAL is a lively if incoherent read, which is part of its fantastical telling."
5,my sweet tooth says I want to but my wisdom tooth says no,"You have to hear that song to believe it! A nice budget compilation of some of Hendersons bluebird recordings. Although robbed blind by Benny Goodman(who actually hired him as an arranger), these songs will show you where the music came from. And anything with Coleman Hawkins and Roy Eldridge playing on it is worth listening to."
4,True story of the movie Paid in Full,"This is the true story of three Harlem drug kingpins (AZ, Alpo & Rich Porter) in the 80's and documents their rise and fall in the drug game. AZ (Azie Fasion) went to write the story that became the movie Paid in Full. To get the full picture of what happened, it is best to view these two movies together. If you are a fan of hip hop, you will learn more about many of the things and people many rappers talk about in their music because this story has influenced many of them. This is a gripping documentary that shows the real side of the drug game, not some romantic view of what happens with money, violence and betrayal. A true picture of America. While this is not the greatest documentray ever made it does give you that ""slice of life."" A definite must-see."
3,Don't throw out your old stuff yet,"When I used this product, I found that my lightly soiled items (clothes mainly)seemed to come out as clean as with your normal type detergents. When I washed my bedding and towels, I could visibly see body soil on my boyfriend's pillowcase. I am talking drool and dirty hair residue. I rewashed with my old detergent and they came out super clean.In general I recommend you keep some of regular detergent around for the heavily soiled stuff."
1,Its not a good one.,"The features of this phone, is not good as it sounds. The buttons are very hard to operate. some features of answering machine didn't work.I learnt a lesson for online shopping: Read the reviews before u shop. (infact these reviews were posted already).Overall this phone is not good."
4,Great Phone,"I bought this phone at a yard sale as a second phone in the office. It has great features such as; Simple controls, easy to use, and best of all the speaker phone.It has no manual, how do you set the clock?"
3,It worked for awhile,"This answering machine was decent for a number of years but recently it's been a source of trouble. The fact that picking up another phone doesn't shut it off was always annoying, but our troubles grew as it went haywire after a series of power failures. It now says that memory is full even though no messages are stored. We can no longer record greetings, meaning that it is now useful only as a phone. The most frustrating part is that Casio's customer service number is no longer operable and their website does not list phones and answering machines as products they currently produce. Thus, if you have a problem, you will be unable to receive support. If you're considering buying this now (2006) or in the future, I'd recommend something else."
2,A difference of opinion,"I just purchased the above phone for my parents. I did so based on the excellent reviews from others that appear above. I must admit, I was sceptical in doing so, since I own a Casio/Phonemate product which I am unhappy with. My skeptism was justified. The display on the phone is barely readable, just like mine. When my mother used the phone for the first time, she said it sounded echo-ee. I have a Phonemate cordless phone which is about 7 years old. It was excellent. However, when Casio merged with Phonemate, quality went down the tubes. There is no doubt the phone has many nice features, but does a poor job with the basics such as sound quality and display. Stay away from this one."
4,Color is a problem,"I've had this phone for a month now, and it has been wonderful. It works really fine. Casio has come up with great product. Its design is relly good and looks great...I give it 4 stars for its value. Only problem is its color-> white. I wanted black....but could not get it...."
4,"Pretty good, I'd buy another w/o looking around","I bought two of these phones for my parents (for main phone and a home office phone). The great thing about the phone is that it has a digital VM and Caller ID in one phone. It also can be set to have the VM pick up on the first ring when a telemarketer calls (and blocks their number). The VM is annoying because, like was already mentioned, if the power goes out, your greeting is erased. Two other annoying things, you have to listen to the whole message before erasing it and the VM doesn't shut off when you pick up the handset. I'd buy another one if it meant I didn't have to look for a better one."
4,nifty phone but BAD SOUND,"Cool machine! Nice rotary button A loudspeaker helps a lot compared to my previous phone so when Pac Bell (or other institution) puts me on a long wait I can do other things in my house. There was only one headache: On a recent trip to Paris I was remotely reading messages and suddenly erased all messages OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I just found recently how to do it: press * (BACK) OR # (NEXT) It's wonderful that I discovered that. I will rate it 4 and not 5 because the numeric sound quality is poor (just make a greeting interlaced with some music, you can hardly tell the music. Old tape machines had better sound) Is any engineer reading this?: Can I take the machine appart and install a better chip with more megabytes? E.S."
1,Simpleminded,"While Smith is to be commended for his advocacy of minimalism and simplicity, this book is of little practical use in designing a house. It's tiny, for one thing, and contains very few useful technical drawings and very little factual prose. The prose and drawings aren't inspirational in an abstract way, either -- mostly, they're just mushy, New Age-ish platitudes about minimalism. They're not worth the cover price. Check out Tremblay's ""Small House Designs"" (ISBN 0882669664), which is far superior and just a few bucks more expensive."
5,An excellent work - well done!,"Thank you Mark and Bruce for putting together the book ""Conquering Depression"". I believe it to be the best and most practical book I have ever read on the subject. For once I have found a book outlining a workable program, that develops tangible skills, and that forges and sharpens mighty weapons to defeat and overcome depression. A book that addresses the tri-part nature of man: his spirit, his soul (mind, will and emotions) and his body. I am convinced that should people who suffer the dreadful effects of despair and depression follow the 30 day program outlined in your book, they will be empowered to overcome and defeat their depression. Again, well done !"
3,"Cute Doll, but Too Top Heavy","I bought this doll for my 2 1/2 year old daughter who adores Madeline. She loved it, maybe too much, because the more she played with it, the more we found out that the head was way too heavy for a 2 1/2 year old to handle. She actually cut her lip on the hat when it flopped over on her. The voice of Madeline is not all that clear but my daughter finds it very easy to squeeze her hand to hear her talk. I always get a little nervous when she plays with it for fear of the hard hat doing more damage. Other than that...a doll is a doll."
4,Spring Color,It's still a CA winter so no seed germination as yet. The seed balls were applied to a down slope so some of them rolled all the way down the slope and had to be reapplied.
5,Our grandson's favorite!,This is our grandson's favorite toy! With all the toys out there - that says a lot! Makes a nice little sound when he shakes the fish.
2,not worth the money,"First of all, you should read the product description before purchasing, I did not. The toy is bright and colorful, which is good. But it is small and made out of wood and not worth $15 in my mind. My 10 month old daughter keeps trying to put it in her mouth and it is small enough to fit. However, it is difficult for her to pick up. The size is too big for her hands."
5,"A gorgeous, heirloom quality toy","The photo on Amazon does not do this toy justice. The colors are bright with glazed paint so it practically shines. If you hold the base and shake it back and forth, the discs will clack against each other and make a nice sound. I saw this in Pottery Barn Kids for $17 and I knew I wasn't leaving the store without it. If only I had restrained myself until I could check Amazon and order it online!! My boys are 16 mos. old and they find this toy interesting because it is new but it's really for a younger baby. So I guess I have to 'fess up that I bought this toy for myself!! Oh well."
4,Worth it for the 2 covers,"Very interesting to hear non-electronic versions of Postal Service songs. My favorite is the cover from The Shins. It's the same song, but it takes on a whole new life."
5,Postal Service,Loved the album. I received it shortly after ordering in excellent condition. I am a recent Postal Service convert although I have heard their music for years and just didn't know the band. Now I own three of their albums.
3,Not Kaiser Permanente song,"Nice music, but not the same music as what is on the Kaiser Permanente commercial."
3,Director Ulli Lommel's rare first film finally comes to vide,"TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES, director Ulli Lommel's rare first film, finally comes to video. Best known as an actor for director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Lommel and Fassbinder teamed up for this shocking film about a serial killer, with Fassbinder serving as producer. Following this collaboration, Lommel moves to America where he helmed the cult classic COCAINE COWBOYS starring Andy Warhol before filming a series of horror movies including THE BOGEY MAN and BRAIN WAVES."
5,"Astonishing, artsy, provocative, inspiring, intense and yet",Fassbinder and Lommel created a masterpiece that's been unavailable in the US for 25 years. It's the most shocking portayal of a serial killer I've ever seen. The mood and the performances are awsesome!
1,poor quality control,"When the toilet seat was shipped and still in the protective wrap, it had the stitching badly seperated. We returned it! The return was handled very well!"
1,shipped fast,i bought this hoping it would be by last one to buy but its not.the seat came apart so the next one i buy will be a solid one all wood or all plastic.i gave it 1 star because it shipped very fast.
2,Was expecting more,"I have to say I am quite disappointed with this book.. I was expecting more and in fact what I got (what I paid for) was a somewhat dis-joined mix of pure theory and marketing for SQ. I feel that I could have got this level of company information myself, for free from the company website or other marketing material, and obtained the theory based info from other means. I wanted more connect between theory and actual.. but it was not here for me. I feel I could also saved much time by simply reading the ""Case Study"" at the end of the book and not bothered with the rest of the book since the case study essentially provides a good summary for the preceding 200-odd pages."
2,"Great at first, but quickly deteriorated","I purchased this item because it looked comfortable and I was tired of inflatable lounges. It is very comfortable and has a cup holder, but after a few weeks in the sun, the material started to deteriorate. Edges are fraying and the material is simply falling apart in your hands. I have yet to find replacement material. It is really a shame. I have 2 and they are both comming apart."
3,It's just OK.,"Easy to assemble, it took my husband less than 15 minutes. He is impressed with the rust resistant hardware, but unimpressed with the crackable plastic frame. The great comfort of the sling and padding is sabotaged by the stupid design of the arm-rest! The arm-rest has a raised 1/2"" wide molded seam running down the center where I think it should be a flat comfortable surface. I also have a problem with the foot-rest sleeve slipping off the frame and I may try to apply some adhesive velcro strips to it."
1,Terrible image on this Synergy DVD!,"THE SLEEPING TIGER is a terrific film with a knockout performance by Dirk Bogarde in his first collaboration with director Joseph Losey.It deserves to be seen in a clear print. This Synergy Entertainment DVD and its smudgy print is a travesty. Do they preview these films before they sell them to unsuspecting buyers?If you can't play a reg. 2 DVD, pristine image from Optimum....... get the reg. 1 ""Dark Crimes - 50 Movie DVD Set"" from Mill Creek Entertainment under $12 for 50 films. Don't be put off by the ""50 movies"" bit. Their print of THE SLEEPING TIGER is as clear as you're going to get, and as good as the Optimum. I stumbled on this great find and was amazed. It's also available through some interlibrary loans so you can check it yourself.Good luck."
1,Bummer!,"I was really excited about this purchase. I even painted my bedroom to match this ensemble. However, the product was itchy so I washed it in cold water on delicate cycle. Then tumbled dryer it on low, on short intervals to make sure it would dry evenly. I went to put on my bed and it shrunk considerably. I purchased a king and now it would fit a full size bed, which means its too small even for a queen. Then the returns policy is a partial refund with return costs on me the buyer. I would look elsewhere for camo bedding.Turns out, the product didn't shrink, it has now flattened out from washing. However it is still itching after one wash. That may change after several washings, however, I hope it doesn't fade."
1,Taylor Outdoor Stick Thermometer,"The ordering, shipping and all else went beautifully. The only problem is that this thermometer doesn't work. It registers 10 degrees higher that any of our other thermometers. We an email and no one answered."
3,Like the look but.....,"This is the second one purchased. I thought the first one falling off after several monthswas a fluke, but the second one also fell off after a drastic temperature change."
1,serious junk,"Another made in china useless piece of junk; readings are off by 10-12F. Don't buy this, invest in a decent thermometer instead."
1,"This hat is not ""SATIN"" it is a see threw hat.",Ordered this hat thinking it was going to be SATIN. It is not. The other reviewer i thought was just sent the wrong hat so i ordered it anyway thinking i would recieve the right hat. This company sent me a Fabric gauze see threw material witch hat.
2,This hat is NOT satin!,"This hat is not satin as advertised. The material is see-through like gauze. Even the tag says ""fabric witch hat"" rather than ""satin witch hat."" It is also much flimsier than the photo makes it appear. BUT for the low price, it is adequate for my child's dress-up play. I just feel misled by the product description."
3,Provokes you to put your belief into action.,"This is a book that takes a look at practical, primitive religion. However, I wasn't pleased with the stereotyping of the characters. When speaking of black women, it would have been nice to see them described as gently as the other characters (who were assumed to be white). Black women do not have ""broods"" of children and black female police officers are not imposing and threatening. Anybody in a police uniform is imposing. This fact was neglected when the main character was giving communion with an armed guard present in the room. Am I too assume that he/she was white and less imposing by way of his whiteness? The overall message of the book was clear, and I can appreciate what the author was trying to say. However, the descriptions of the ethnic races throughout the book didn't reflect the message the book was trying to present."
3,Mostly a review of other peoples' writings,"This book has some interest value - but does not really get to the point and heart of why music has such an impact on our minds. It is more of a long review of other peoples' writing on this topic - mostly psychologists, sometimes turgidly long. Read Oliver Sachs as well, and get nearer to the mark."
5,Labyrinth Fan Must-Have!,"I wrote a review previously on the condition of the book I received (great, and fast shipping too! Thanks cactuswren!) and now I have a little to say about the story itself. I absolutely loved it - as someone who's seen the film maybe one too many times, the book is refreshing. It's a fun combination of the original script Jim Henson had and the script used for the film. The personalities of Jareth, Sarah, Hoggle, and even Sir Didymus are given a little more depth (I especially liked the ballroom scene!)Like the title says - a must have for Labyrinth geeks ;)"
3,Awesome!,"If you love the movie this is a must have book! It tells the plot of the movie while adding discriptions that make you feel like you are in the movie. In fact, sometimes when I read it I feel as if I am Sarah and when I am in a mischevious mood it makes me feel like as if I am Jareth the Goblin King."
3,Super Reader,"Luckily, as far as this book goes it is pretty far away from the other Lois & Clark type books. It is much more of a straight Superman adventure. This, as far as reading the thing goes, is most definitely a good thing.Cherryh does a reasonable job of handling Superman doing one thing, and Lois another, as usually happens. If you are a Superman book fan and see this somewhere really cheap, you may as well grab it."
1,I was very disappointed in the book.,"I really like Lois and Clark and I really like the author C.J. Cherryh but the book is definately not up to her usual standards. There is practically no interaction between Lois and Clark and that is what makes the stories work on TV. If she tries again I would remind her of ""The Gate"" series she wrote with Morgana. I loved that series and it was the reason I paid as much as I did for the Lois and Clark book she wrote. I would hesitate to do so again because of my disappointment."
2,"Good in parts, but I've read far better L&C fanfiction","One thing about the title was right: it is a *Superman* novel. It is not a *Lois and Clark* novel: if you're looking for Lois and Clark interaction you won't get it. There is a vaguely interesting story about Superman assisting with a natural disaster in Eastern Europe, while Lois is depicted missing Clark and unaware of where he is. The plot around substandard building work which causes collapses in Metropolis is interesting, and of course seeing Lois depicted as a hero makes a pleasant change. But why on earth does Cherryh make Lois visit Lex in prison? And why do we only get a page or so of very unsatisfying L&C interaction right at the end, since the story takes place shortly after their engagement.If you're looking for an interesting story with plenty of L&C interaction, you'd be better saving your money and visiting the fanfiction archive on the Internet."
5,the best,"The Wusthof knives are the best in my opinion. This ""cheese"" knife is extremely well-made and durable. Fits the hand easily and maintains the edge forever (or at least as long as I have been using it). You pay more for the quality, but it is well worth it."
3,Beretta review,"The book is very dated but contains come great historical information about the company and it's flagship pistol - the 92FS.Ayoob is a conversational writer and tells an entertaining story. He has also compiled quite an extensive set of details about Beretta firearms - most of which are no longer manufactured.But if you like Beretta or have an older Beretta that you want to get some details on, this is a good source.Three stars because of the outdated nature of much of the material."
1,Not Worth The Paper Its Printed On,"I am a practicing licensed professional engineer that was looking for a book on Excel written for practicing engineers. This book's title is totally misleading. It implies that it is written for ""engineers"" and ""scientists"" not engineering and/or science students. In my opinion, this book was written for high school students.Don't waste your money on this if you're looking for a practitioners reference book. I wouldn't recommend this book to another professional engineer even if it was free.The book is also obsolete since it was written in 2003. Excel 2007 has many significant changes to the GUI (i.e., the ""ribbon"" interface).It's not worth your time to even browse through. This book falls very short of what the title implies. I made the classic mistake of ""judging a book by its cover"". I wasted my money and time on it."
1,Remakes,"The original Night Stalker from the 1970's was the best,sometimes when people try to remake something they screw it up royally,and they did it with this one.Seems like nowadays producers can't come up with anything new so they try to do a remake, but in the end, the original is always the best.I grew up watching the 1970's tv series when it came on friday nights at 10pm.we had a black and white 19 in tv.,and had to go out side to move the antenna to get the channel in to see it.I was only a kid and so was scared to death after watching every episode.I wished that it had kept on going from yr to yr.I bought all of the dvd's from the 70's.They are great.This is what led to all the movies and show from the 80's til now,this is the Godfather of the shows,this is what started it all.So watch and beware if you can.Watch the originals from the 1970's"
1,Buyer beware; bad DVD packaging,"I have returned two sets to Amazon; both arrived with the first disc loose and badly scratched. Amazon tells me the problem is ""more widespread than they thought"", and are unable to replace with good set."
1,Not good at any level.....,"I attempted to watch this series when it originally aired on ABC but was unable to continue past the second episode. Why? The acting was bad, the scipt contrived, and the whole idea of trying to remake a classic series redundant.The fact that the person who wrote for this series also wrote for some X Files episodes is ironic considering that Chris Carter, the creator of the X Files, stated that the original Night Stalker was an inspiration. This series attempted to be like the X Files by being 'mysterious' and totally reworking the original Night Stalker series, but it failed due to bad casting, writing and a main storyline that nobody really cared about.Do yourself a favor and watch the original series. There is a reason why this show got cancelled as fast as it did."
4,Shame it didn't go on,"Great series, shame it didn't continue. Pays some minor homage to the original series, however has more of a little X-files feel mixed in."
2,This is a DVD!!,"I cannot believe that they put this lame series out on DVD and yet so many great series have never be done in DVD (such as WKRP).This series was X-Files part 2. However, the stories were disjointed. The acting was horrible, and the characters had no personality. Can you imagine? Carl Kolchak without personality?Any resemblance with ""The Night Stalker"" with Darren McGavin is purely coincidental. Essentially, they used the title and character names but nothing else resembles the real Night Stalker. What this series is, is a lot of hip-moody music, dark shadowing lighting, popular dizzying camera cuts, and very lame stories.I cannot imagine they were able to fill a single DVD with episodes since the series was (rightfully) canned early on."
1,The worst TV show ever?,"In my opinion, this is absolutely the worst remake of a television series ever done.I don't know what Mr. Spotnitz was thinking on this baby, but he should retire and live off his X-Files and Millenium residuals, because this turkey is the worst show ever.If you are into collecting the worst of the worst, then this one is for you.Otherwise, save your money and catch Darren McGavin in the original tv series on dvd."
4,Worth purchasing for 1st episode,"The newest version of The Night Stalker pales in comparison to the original starring Darren McGavin.Some of us are starved for this genre of television, that we will watch to hope it comes close to the excellence of the old series - This DVD is worth purchasing for the meeting of the new Kolchak with the old in the newsroom - episode 1. Darren McGavin, reading a newpaper, wearing his trademark hat, nods to the new Kolchak - it is a classic homage from the old to the new.The new series got caught up in some silliness and never held the watcher as the original. But for me, seeing the 2 Kolchaks was worth the DVD price.However,I was a fan of the 'new' Night Stalker - made you think that the truth is out there beyond your reach...and not every series can say that."
3,Not as good as the original,"The maker of this series should have included monsters like vampires or werewolves instead of real life killers and criminals,was very disappointed"
3,Worth it for Joan,"This is one of those bad movies Joan Crawford made toward the end of her career. But her fans needn't feel any embarrassment here (as we do in the case of TROG) for I SAW WHAT YOU DID is simply light, tongue-in-cheek entertainment that will leave you chuckling over its sheer absurdity. Joan's performance here is a serious contender for her all-time worst, but it's funny-bad. Whether you love Joan or hate her, you'll laugh out loud when she catches that young girl snooping around John Ireland's house and commands her again and again to ""GET OUT OF HERE! "" Only problem is, a viewer unfamiliar with Joan's otherwise excellent work may wind up thinking she took acting lessons from Wile E. Coyte.The letterboxing is welcome; however, John Castle doesn't exactly have Fellini's or Antonioni's artistic eye.Bubba"
4,"very slick and witty script, almost as eerie as blair witch",i really enjoyed this old movie because you can see how an innocent joke can turn into a serious scare.
1,BORING!,"I couldn't find this movie for rent so I took a chance and bought it, and boy do I hate wasting money. The whole movie was about Libby chasing her stupid younger sister around: ""Tess, come here!"", ""Tess, where are you?"", ""TEESSSS!"", ""Tess, do this!"". I HATE TESS! Stupid little girl running off into the night, LET HER! The background music was very distracting too. Throw a swear word in the dialogue and make it believable! Completely bad."
4,fun movie....,"I bought this movie because the plot appealed to me...two teen girls make prank phone calls to handsome stranger who has just murdered his wife! Sounds great...and although I enjoyed this film very much...the comedy and humor just did not seem to fit in, although by the film's climax, I found myself engrossed...this film was fun to watch, a little tacky and dated, especially the music...but it was a good time..."
3,"I saw what you did, really I did. Okay it's a prank. Thank God no caller ID.","I remember this movie from back in the day and for the fellas please tell me if you don't think Joyce Meadows was shapely or not? She played the mysterious wife who gets killed in the beginning. I had to rewind a few times to believe she had that kind of figure. Overall a campy movie, but the music in the end was just completely out of place. A dead guy is in the back seat and the kids are giggling over their parents being upset at them. Strange ending to what could have been a really good movie."
5,I Saw What You Did and I Rate It a 5!,"This movie is really a great film for the Low Budget films of Days gone by. Joan Crawford is in this, but just for a few fleeting moments. It's not her best acting gig, and she sure didn't get any awards for this film. I noticed that some people gave it only 1 star...I bet that these people are younger and don't remember our old phone systems and the simpler days of living. This movie will keep your attention, especially if you are a baby boomer or older, as you will remember all the pranks that we all used to do on the phone. The first time I ever saw this film, it scared the crap out of me! The out in the middle of nowhere house, the fog...Boy can I relate to that growing up in the country!This film is scary, without all the blood, gore and violence that you see in todays horror films! I highly recommend this film!"
3,A cute little horror film,"This movie is cute. Its not scary its fun with William Castles gimmicks. I think in its time it was possibly scary but its very dated. You have Steve Marak, just committed a crime, and 3 little girls call him up and say ""I saw what you did and I know who you are"". Somehow, I do not want to give away too much, he finds out where they live and goes to get them. The movie is a little slow but quite entertaining. Joan of course camps it up as a desperate bitch. Its worth viewing and is campy, not quite as campy though as berserk, queen bee, or trog. Just get it any enjoy yourself you can never have enough Joan!"
3,UXORICIDE ANYONE?,"Well, we do see Ms. Joan - albeit for a few fleeting moments in this rather quirky little thriller about two teenagers playing the usual phone-pranks, with not too pleasant results ..... seems that an unusually uxorious husband has just successfully silenced ...... well, that would be giving the plot away.....Quite a delicious little Castle here - fits quite well with ""Macabre"" and the operatic, and little seen ""Homicidal"".BUT what IS Miss Crawford wearing around her neck? Memories about that 'enhancement' still drawfs the rest of the movie.WARNING : Never leave your Driver's license within open view ......."
4,A excelent child's book. An inspiration for myself,"This book, combined with it's excelent artwork (at least in the version I read) was a excelent story for childern of all ages. Actually I read this book 32 times when I was a child"
1,Do Not Buy,As with many of the reviews below my monitor went blank one month after the warranty expired. The screen just went black without any warning. The power button blue light is on but does not work. I have to unplug it to turn it off. Take my word for it DO NOT BUY this monitor. There is an obvious problem that Gateway will not fix if it is out of warranty.
1,JUNK!!!!!! DO NOT BUY,"I bought this momitor late January of 2006 and it quit working April 2007, of course this is just a couple months out of warrenty as this monitor only has a 1 year warrenty, A few months ago I started getting a red vertical line down the center of the screen, Gateway tried to tell me it was my video card, which is was not because it worked fine with other monitors. After a while the line went away so I did not pursue it anymore, A couple days ago it just went blank and now does nothing. The blue power button light is still on and i cannot turn it off so have to unplug monitor. I believe the same porblem was described by A Simms from Texas. I find it despicable that monitor that cost close to $600 only has a 1 year warrenty. Yes it was my fault for not reading the fine print, but trust me Gateway well never get another cent from me."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This Piece of Junk,"Bought this monitor along with complete Gateway System about 20 months ago and now, like many others, the screen will not come up...Blue light on all the time and of course Gateway Support says "" Oh too bad for you, we have your money, Ha Ha."" I will never buy another Gateway product and you may want to think it over before you commit. I'm thinking about smashing it on Youtube...to send Gateway folks a message."
1,1.7 year life unacceptable for $500. item,"Power button useless shortly after the year warranty was up and display totally gone after 1.7 year use. Product was great while it lasted, but for $500. I expect a longer life."
1,Gateway fpd2185w,"Forget the BBB, File a complaint with the Fair Trade Commission. We might actually get somewhere there. [..]"
2,Gateway on a Mac,"I purchased 2 of these 21"" and 1 Gateway FPD2485W (24"") for my Mac Pro. I got them because they where the second best for color for photographers under $1000. Apple Cinema`s being #1 under $1k.Well I have issues after 2 years. One the digital out will not work and had to switch to a analog cable. This worked for 3 months and now it goes black at random. I can turn it off and back on and it works or (mostly) doesn't. The other one is starting to flicker. Turning it off and back on works so far.The 24"" one is great so far."
1,disappointed,"Two years old and monitor quit working. First it would not turn off, needed to unplug the power source, then it just turned to black. A complete waste of money. Why should a $500+ monitor quit working after just two years. Will not buy another gateway product. They do not stand behind their products."
5,Great monitor still running,I've had this monitor for 4.5 years now and it's still running perfectly. No dead pixels or other issues. The swivel feature is great!
1,It bored me,"I found nothing of interest in this collection. Many of the tracks used the little trick of recording someone speaking in a normal voice throughout the ""song."" Not rapping, just speaking. How boring is that? Did the producers imagine that this is clever?Volume 10 is quite good. This one is a waste."
1,Sounds like a good idea when you buy it,"There is a TINY notice attached stating that you should charge (wind) the battery every 3 months.You are keeping this for emergencies. If there are no emergencies, you are not likely to think about it. When the emergency comes up and you haven't faithfully wound it up every 3 months, guess what!!The unit I bought a couple of years ago still emits light, so I guess it's better than nothing. You crank like mad to keep it going. The radio gets local stations in the unlikely event they actually have a report.Better: Just keep some good batteries for emergencies. Get some candles."
1,Avoid product; not emergency-ready,"Marketed as an emergency must have, the product fails to deliver when needed. After about a year's time, the capacitor does not hold a charge after minutes of winding the crank. In other words, the flashlight is now useless.I have kept the flashlight/radio in my car and did indeed wind it every three months per the instructions. Even then, it only holds a charge for about 30 seconds and does not illuminate enough to see well.This product is NOT suitable in emergency situations, is marketed deceptively, and should be avoided.RTM"
3,Good Light,"These are good flashlights, they give off a bright LED light. They are very easy to charge, and it's a nice bonus to have an AM/FM radio but mine doesn't pick up stations very well."
4,"Thanks, Mr. Bus Driver!","Just got back from my first visit to NZ (3 weeks - not nearly long enough, and I'll be back). The bus driver on my day trip to Milford Sound played this album on the return drive... exactly what a bus-load of tired tourists needed. I kept listening thinking ""Some of these songs sound vaguely familiar... and these voices.... familiar."" It wasn't until Weather With You that I clued in and thought ""it's a Finn!"" But which one - I had to ask the driver, and he told me the name of the album and I picked one up in Auckland just before I left. I'll listen to this one a lot, I think!"
5,Excellent reference manual for Software Process Improvement,"This book is the best implementation guide on the market for Software Process Improvement. Whether you're a fledgling company trying to design quality software with no guidelines to go by or a well-developed organization with processes in place, this book offers up many ways you can improve your software quality.It gives you a benchmark to compare your company with ISO 9001, CMM and others which is invaluable. If you're looking for help bringing your software processes into alignment - you want this book!"
3,Precise but theoretical,"I found this book to be pretty useful in terms of explaining SPI in totality. However, it is not very practical in nature."
5,NIGHTMARES IS A UNTIQUE HORROR FLICK!!!!!!!!,"Nightmares is a great horror story flick and each story is different and untique and has a great cast to go along with it!!!! If you a fan of Tales from the Crypt and Tales from the Darkside and Twilight Zone then you should check this movie out!!!!!! You have a maniac after this woman which is on her way to get some smokes and then you have a kid that loves video games and the game takes over his life and last,but not least a giant sized rat that is terrorizes this family!!!!! I love my 80's horror flicks and this one is no different and its a must watch movie so go out and rent it tonight!!!!!!"
4,Awesome horror movie for the 80s!,"This movie used to always play during the ""Horror Matinees"" on the local channels in the 80s. This movie used to scare the you know what out of me as a child, and it still gives me the creeps as an adult. This is a must-have for any 1980s horror movie collector."
2,"Decent, but rent it first",Four short stories. The first one about a lady and a serial killer is done well. The second I really liked because Emilio Estevez plays a charcter similar to the one he did in Repo Man. The last two stories stink though.
2,"WATCH ANY NETWORK ""SPECIAL"" PROGRAMMING","First and foremost, I heard about this movie for years. And as legends grow, so do the myths. A friend of mine ALWAYS talked about a movie that had a ""BLACK TRUCK"" in it. This truck was evil. It had a ""UP-SIDE DOWN"" Crucifix hanging from the window. ""BIG WHOOP"".The ONLY scene that me ""JUMP"" was the first episode. The only ""OTHER"" reason to buy this tape is to see a young Emillo Estevas, (THE COOLEST OF THE BROTHERS) and to hear the ORIGINAL MISFITS and FEAR. Other than wanting to be sixteen/seventeen again, I can do without this movie.I'll leave alone the ""RAT"" story, only because i still like the guy who Ann Romano boyfriend on ""ONE DAY AT A TIME"" (RICHARD MASER)No thrills-chills or whatever. A recommendation, ""Trilogy of Terror"".THANXX, FREEBIRD"
5,NIghtmares should not fade into obscurity!,A young Emilio Estevez shines in this great short story compilation. All the stories are good but the one Estevez is in where he becomes obsessed with a video game is the best one. It sort of like Cat's Eye or The House That Dripped Blood. If you enjoy short stories and horror pick it up.
1,USELESS JUNK,I bought it to remove a security gate. I followed all instruction but I can only remove a loose one-way screw with this tool. It did not work at all on other tightened screws. My $5 pliers work better than this crap. DO NOT BUY THIS!!
5,While I give this 5 stars...,"This was not the development period of his now secret work. For the ten years prior to Pike's peak Tesla lived in NY and while trying to prove Hertz's claims Tesla accidentally discovered 'radiant energy' in a different form. This (after 10 years) led him to learn how to stimulate energy by an 'electro-static event."" Later his focus was on understanding how to capture the energy from the electro-static event and then convert it back into normal electricity. It was in Pike's peak (the period this book covers) that he develops new hardware for the already understood event that he wished to reproduce, just on a massive scale. Pike's peak was the preamble to the famous tower and first working prototype of it."
3,"Poor publishing, post-it notes to ""correct"" printing errors.","The quality of this book from the OUTSIDE looks great. The inside, however, has much to be fixed.This NEVER should have been released to the public with such errors, and sloppy ""fixing"" by pasting small pieces of paper saying ""this should be on page 41"" and the like. Some information is missiong that SHOULD be in the book somewhere. If it is, I cant find it. Not everything is translated, and messy handwritten notes, while interesting, add nothing to the book other than nostalgia because they arent translated.I'd love to see a book published in a dual-page format that isn't a mess like this one. I'd be willing to pay much more.I feel I was cheated because of the price of this book."
4,It was a gift for my brother in law.,He really liked it. We had seen the movie 'the prestige' which featured a fictional tesla. No need for fiction with such an electrifying life!!!
3,And that's all it is....notes! Cryptic and nothing else.,"I have read this ""book"", and it is very true to its title. This is just a transcription of his thoughts, but not at all coherent, nor is there any insight provided by anyone. But all in all, it is ""notes"", and not much else."
2,I guess I'm in the minority here,I really didn't like this book. Seemed the characters jumped into bed way too quickly. This whole anger thing that Jack later has towards Angela was a bit off. It wasn't her secret to reveal. And hey never mind there wouldn't have been a secret if he didn't have one first. Seemed this wasn't addressed to the fullest at all. Granted the incident happened years ago but still he was her boyfriend and just because they had a fight didn't mean that he needed to jump in with the first woman he comes across.
3,Wrong Package Information,"At the back of the case, it states containing 2 dics. Indeed, you can only find one disc. I suppose the packaging information of DVD is wrongly duplicated in Blu ray. Such a mistake should not be made.The quality of blu ray is quite good. Frank Mir was no match for Brock Lensar."
5,UFC best event,"These UFC event is a have to watch and buy for all UFC fansand great for first time watchers to see what it is like,because you have three great main match plus the all of the other good matcherslike UFC Hall of framer Mark Coleman vs Stephan Bonnar,It's the best card they have put together."
2,Not always accurate or up-to-date,"I used this book twice on recent hiking trips to Washington and Oregon and found various inaccuracies for at least half of all the hikes I tried from this book's descriptions. In many of those cases descriptons on how to get to the trailheads where inaccurate, or if or what parking pass is required at some of the trailheads. But what really is missing is information on the road conditions to the trailheads: I found that many of them can only be accessed with a four wheel drive or high clearance vehicle -- something that would be good to know ahead of timeif you only have a plain old passenger car like I do. My recommendation is to take the information in this book with a grain of salt and to consult at least one other hiking guidebook before you venture out to go hiking."
3,"Quality products, but not a beginners workout","My main objective for this purchase was for the ball. I used it during my pregnancy (birth ball). Since I do have a background in yoga and pilates, I didn't need an in depth video, just demonstrations on poses. So for the price, the bands and the ball and outline video--it is a great deal. It isn't as bad as what others have written. But it isn't a workout video...just a basic rundown of some positions and techniques in using the ball and bands. Another thing, is with workout videos, they get repetitous (sorry for the spelling) and this video encourages you to 'mix' up and create your workouts, so you don't get bored. It gives you more independence. Again not for beginners but for those who have a background and want more independence in their workouts."
1,Lousy Product - Absolutley worthless video,"I bought this kit hoping that, as a beginner, the tape would be a good guide to the Pilates exercises. The tape goes through exercises, but only for about 10 seconds each - hardly enough time to grasp the exercises. It is more of an outline than an exercise video. It goes through basic exercises, then band exercises, then ball exercises. There is NO WORKOUT in this tape!!! I feel ripped off because now I feel like I have to buy a Pilates workout video!"
1,Nightmare,"I had the Core Secrets ball for months and loved it till my cats popped it and I had to buy a replacement. I decided to buy this one because it was less expensive and I didn't care about the extras, I just needed a new ball. What a bad idea to save a dollar. The ball would not hold air, there were no instructions on how to fill the ball or how big to inflate it. The pump that came with the ball didn't fit in the hole and leaked air as fast as I could pump it in. Horrible all the way around. The money I saved, I spent in gas driving back to return this piece of crap."
1,Absolute Rip Off,"There is no workout in this kit! The video only provides quick demonstration of the exercises - about 10 seconds each. You go through forty minutes of intruction and then the video ends with a suggested workout, but it is only outline form - they didn't even have the courtesy to provide it for you so you can do it while watching the tape!!!"
2,Not much guidance in this video,"The packaging of this set is great, each piece is individually packaged and placed in a box. The ball was fairly easy to inflate with the included pump, although it takes awhile and your arm gets quit tired. The strengths of the bands are good, with a wide range of resitances between the three.The video and included leaflet left me really confused. The leaflet gives an overview of yoga and pilates, and covers a few moves of each, which are not necessarily included in the video.The biggest dissapointment is the video. It gives demonstrations of several moves on the floor, with the ball, and with the bands, but does not include and instructor led workout. It gives an example &quot;good beginner&quot; workout, but you need to be familiar enough with the moves to create and perform it on your own. Of course you can order additional guidance, on CD, from Reebok.Overall, for a busy mom, there is not enough time to learn the moves, create my own workout, and then do it."
3,--inside a thug's heart,"i feel as though angela ardis was most definetly played. nobody knows who she is. he never spoke of her. at the end when he 'supposedly' showed up at her house, she never told us if i was real or another one of her fantasies. he was in jail for 11 mo so who knows who else he was writing. but i did see a sweeter side of him."
4,Excellent,"I was never much of a fan of Irish traditional/folk music. I mainly liked Clannad for their later, 'new age' music. But I was given this album and, let me tell you, it rocks. The songs feature great musical arrangements, especially ""Eirigh Is Cuir...Coiriu,"" my favorite fast song on the album. It's a really catchy song (I especially love the instrumental-only part of the song) that will get your feet tapping. The album also includes some beautiful, moving ballads, such as ""Eirigh Suas a Stoirin,"" which feels like a soft mist descending and then rising. Those 2 songs alone make the album worth buying, but the other songs are great also. In fact, if I were more of a traditional-music fan to begin with, I would probably give the album 5 stars."
3,Hands on Log Homes,"I'm about half way through with the book. It is basically just short stories about people who have built a log home. Very little inside about the actual construction which is what i was led to believe with the title, ""Hands on Log Homes""."
2,The sequal on Satrun was awesome this though...........,"I loved the arcade version and the Saturn version of the 2nd VF. The original was a break through in graphics introducing 3-D models, generated by a computer. However, that is all this game has to offer pretty much the graphics are really outdated and aren't colorful like they are in old school street fighter and Streets of rage games. The game play is the biggest down fall by far!"
3,Original 3D fighting game,"32X was brought about to compete with the SNES's graphic engine. 32X was better, but it cost more as an add on so it failed. Also the rumors of Saturn and Playstation didn't help matters.This game is a flagship game for the 32X. It is a great collectors peice, since it was such a historical game for the failing system."
5,Fast heat up,Liked the low wattage to put it to rest- and it goes to full power quickly. It does have the first use smoking problem but it's comparable to regular usage.
1,Hoped for something better - I guess you get what you pay for,"I purchased this iron about 2 years ago and had high hopes due to the decent reviews. On the very first use, at the lowest heat level, the iron started smoking from within the bulky part of the handle. Smells like PCB or internal components burning. Makes the iron pretty much unusable. I might have time to take it apart and figure out what is wrong later..."
1,"You idiots sent me solder, not a soldering iron","You idiots sent me solder, not a soldering iron. The label on the package even said it was a soldering iron, and someone had even written on the label that it was the wrong product (mislabeled). I can't even imagine anyone could mistake solder for a soldering iron. DUH!!!"
3,Nostalgia,"Talk about the effectiveness of advertising. I bought this album as a teenager because of the incredible cover photo. I thought with packaging this slick, the double album must hold some interesting songs. The CD release contains two lp's, and like most of Linda's albums, the results are mixed. There are some very good tracks, especially ""I Can't Let This Good Thing Get Away"" and ""Sweet Melodies,"" which are not available on her greatest hits collection. There are also some very weak tracks that one suspects were foisted on her by a record company looking to recreate the sales of ""If My Friends Could See Me Now"" and ""Runaway Love."" The knock-off's are not pleasant, more grating and irritating. However, a good sales gimmick is enduring; I saw that sultry cover photo and bought the CD years after I had sold the vinyl record at a yard sale."
5,Your Private Sky,"I was looking forward to receivinging this book .........The newly published book was just what I expected. It contains Bucky's whole life history and his various ideas that arised during his life such as the famous geodesic dome, dymaxion products, tensegrity, world game and so on. Many are what I have not obtained so far in detail from other literatures already published. So they are extremely usefull and fun to me. The most important thing that I could get from the book is that I could feel strong power to live the daily life again with fresh dreams."
3,It slides...,"My seat has been in daily use for eight months--it seems durable enough, looks great, and has held up just fine. I love the design, but that's the only reason it's still installed. After a short while, no matter how much I tighten the bolts, the seat loosens and begins to slide. I thought maybe it was just my toilet until I read the other reviews here. Very frustrating!Also, another reviewer noted the title says ""embroidered"" but the product isn't--my horse design isn't either; it's printed fabric under a clear plastic cover."
3,ok horse decorated toilet seat,"This would be a great item if they had put the design under the lid as well, unfortunately , the lid must always be down in order to enjoy the horse design , which is really nice!"
2,Good product but doesn't last,"We were excited to get this for our ""sea creature"" themed bathroom. We have had this less than 6 months and the lid is falling apart. The ""seam"" has come apart and the foam is coming out... just regular use of putting the seat up and down... super sad!!!"
1,junk,"I was excited to see the made in USA tag,considering we don't get to see it much any more.Mostly we see made in China!Big disappointment;the poorest quality I seen in a while.This product belongs in the toilet instead of on it!"
3,"Made my son happy, but not best quality","My son just wanted a ""fish toilet"" and I bought this. He likes that its soft, but there is a hole in seat seam already."
4,Great resource for learning how to use Access to analyse your data.,"While most Access books focus on designing forms and reports, this book goes straight to the basics of analyzing data. After a short review of table design, the author quickly gets to the heart of data analysis by showing how to construct queries by using Access's graphical interface and illustrating how to write your own SQL. Advanced query techniques using subqueries and domain aggregate functions are fully described.The author demonstrates how to create pivot tables and charts from within Access and how to use Visual Basic for Applications to increase the power of your application.I recommend this book for beginning and intermediate users of Access who need to learn how to use Access to analyze data.Truitt L. BradlySenior Actuarial AnalystMicrosoft Office - Access - Most Valuable Professional 2007"
2,Good Book Problems with Kindle Edition,"This is a very good book for doing exactly what the title says. Easy to follow and there are a lot of useful tips on how to design queries and perform solid data analysis using Access. This is not a beginners book on how to use Access but a good learning tool once a few Access fundamentals have been learned elsewhere.The Kindle edition has problems. Many of the screen shots of the actual examples (in particular of the query builder) are not readable on the kindle (and aren't readable on the kindle for PC), unfortunately for many of the sections this renders the information useless since it means you can't actually read the instructions for what is being demonstrated.The hardcopy book is a 5 the Kindle version a 1 or 2. Hopefully the Kindle version can be reformatted and redistributed."
4,Access,I purchased this book as a textbook for an Access class I am taking. It is a very good source to help with the class. I especially like to be able to go to the site listed on the book and work with the data on line. This helps me to practice the different tasks the book is teaching. I recomend this to anyone who is learning Access.
5,the reason why I like Access,"This is a book for anyone who has to deal with data sets. Not for people who have to learn about relational databases or Forms or Reports or who want to learn SQL, but number crunching (not for banks, or IBM or Walmart). That is what the intro says too. The examples actually work. The author also points out that sometimes Access is great to do front-up work for back-end Excel analysis. Tool selection and/or sequencing can make a big difference. One of the most helpful/useful books I have read regarding my work."
4,Access does a lot,"I ordered this book in order to find out how to set up a data file. I know the basics, but each data base software is different. This book answered this questions in two pages and I will use the book later if and when I actually set my data up in Access. Right now I have it in Excel which is satisfactory for what I am doing.ThanksH.S. Munro"
4,"a good, quick, read.","As a fan of Wonder Woman, i support any work that includes her. Bryne's novel is to the point. It isn't much different from his writing in comics but still is a good story. I thought that the book was good in having a more realistic view towards the large issues that are brought up. The only problem that i have with the book is the fact that it is written omnisciently. It would have been better if it were all told through wonder woman's eyes. Like a previous reviewer, i too would like more detailed action scenes."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"The amazing thing is how someone who did such a good job remaking Superman in the mid 1980s could do such a horrible job here. This flies in the face of the credo of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Wonder Woman had already been recreated masterfully by the great George Perez (who collaborated with Marv Wolfman on the award winning Teen Titans and Crisis on Infinite Earths). Byrne basically shredded everything that Perez had done.I won't even get into how he later screwed up the whole Donna Troy history. Maybe he can do Hawkman next. At least that character is so screwed up with so many revisions that Byrne can't possibly do it any more harm!"
2,better if it containes more fighting scenes,It bought it to entertain battle scenes against her foes. But it lacks of these scenes except for last. And last scene are too short and lacks of direct description either. I'd like more hard-boiled battle scenes.
1,"Well, nice try","I'm going to be brief, I had high hopes for this book but it failed to entertain me. The art was by far Bryne's worst work ever nor was his writing particularly good. He fails to follow threw on any plots, the characters have no motivation and Diana is so hideously out of character it makes me cringe to think about it."
1,Byrne can not write prouse,"This novel pretty much read like one of Byrne's Wonder-Woman comic book stories, except that he expanded it to a novel. Wonder-Woman does not translate to prouse very well at all. When she uses her powers, or something of big importance happens to her, Byrne leaves the exact details of it out of the text, it is left to the reader to figure out what's going on. John Byrne should stick with comics instead of trying anymore novels."
1,Horrible read -- BuyY the Loebs/Deodato Collections!,"John Byrne was a great comic book writer/artist -- FIFTEEN YEARS AGO...However, his skills have been failing him since then... Wonder Woman represents perhaps the lowest point in his otherwise remarkably good career. As a previous reviewer stated, this IS his worst artwork to date and the character is written COMPLETELY out of character.If you want a Wonder Woman written IN-CHARACTER with excellent art, I refer you to Loebs/Deodato Wonder Woman collections, The Contest and The Challenge of Artemis...Otherwise, with the Byrne Wonder Woman you ARE wasting your money in my opinion..."
4,THE MYTHICAL LEGENDARY PRINCESS OF AMERICA,"Wonder Woman is such a best-selling comic book been told by William Moulton Marston. This adaptive series covered by John Byrne on Diana (The Amazing Amazon) adopted The Mythical Folklore Stories of Hercules having the same formula. Like other Mythical Heroes were introduced to the Series that Mr. Marston had brought up the great ancient Superhero taken over Hercules role in the stories. Wonder Woman is the 3rd rate Superhero from the Justice League of America was picked after Superman, Batman, Aquaman, and Green Lantern.Wonder Woman tells a story about the amazon nation living on a magical island called ""Themysciria"" where all women were trained to be warriors. Queen Hippolyta was gifted to create a clay statue name Diana to life and brought her to man's world by becoming an ambassador."
5,Amazingly helpful resource for educators!,"This collection of things to do to promote cultural understanding within oneself and inclusion in the classroom is essential for every teacher's library, teacher education classes, and for all educators interested in preparing our children for a diverse universe. Filled with practical suggestions, intrasprective honesty and sensivity to a wealth of differences, this could be a text for methods classes dealing with ways to create safe classroom environments, as well as culturally proficient students living in our multicultural world."
5,Most valuable addition to my library,"Tired of stockinette? Try Modular Knits. Each technique in this wonderful book is clearly explained and practice directions are included. This make creating beautiful items easy and interesting. People will stop you on the street and ask you how you make these. Scarves, shawls, bags, garments are all included. And they have no seams. I just can't stop making these things. Try one scarf and you are hooked. This is a great book and a valuable adddition to your library."
5,Spectacular Complex knitting made easy by innovative designing,"My whole knitting world has changed with this book. I have knit modularly before and hated picking up stitches and sewing everything together. Iris has made this method obsolete and explains everything with an ease that make modular knitting truly fun. I can't wait to see how each block or triangle will come together and think, it can't be this easy, but it is! If you are a fan of handpainted yarns this book is a must have!"
5,A GREAT book with new techniques,"I love this book. The techniques are new, allowing you to create a unique item without having to sew in a lot of ends. YAY!! There are patterns for scarfs, vests, shawls, purses, etc., etc. Lots of color pictures of everything. Iris tells you exactly what yarns were used and gives you substitutions as well. I have made several of the scarfs in the book and love them. I HATE sewing in ends, so these patterns are excellent for me. Thank you, Iris, for sharing your talent, and I look forward to seeing more from you."
1,Modular Knits Iris Schreier,"Ms. Schreier requested that her internet group write a positive review of her book with the promise of a free pattern.The book has really good ideas, and with the help of my local yarn shop I was able to knit the zigzag scarf. The instructions in the book have errors.Most of group member seems to be requesting help for the same errors. One would think she would write corrections to her book.When I contacted Ms Schreier I was told her instructions were correct and I should join her group.I would buy the book only if you can get help from your local yarn store or you have been knitting a very long time."
5,Fabulous New Knitting Concept,"Modular Knitting by Iris Schrier is one of the newest concepts to hit the knitting market in a very long time. Her novel approach to design and execution has lit a fire under new and oldtimers in the knitting world. Take a look at this book, try out some of the designs and be on the way to knitting ecstasy. Flaunt those fashions that you create."
3,Great Concept,"I checked this book out from the library prior to purchasing the book. I thought it had some great projects in it, now if I can only find the right yarns for them.I am not a fan of some of the colors in the projects that are showcased in the book.I have yet to make anything from the book..."
5,Simply fabulous!,"I have never been one who particularly enjoyed the thought of picking up stitches, and I have always adored variegated yarns. This book has patterns which fit both of my tendencies perfectly! The patterns are easy to read and follow, the knitting relaxing and enjoyable, and the final results are spectacular! By the way, using variegated yarn is not essential, but it sure does adds to the fun when watching the object grow on your needles. No advanced knitting abilities are required, either. Enjoy!"
5,Innovative Knitting,"This is a fun book for the intermediate knitter. Modular knitting is a great way to use odd balls of yarn or to avoid the boredom of straight knitting and the tediousness of seaming a garment. It is particularly fun to either mix yarns or to use the the new ""hand paint"" color mixes and watch what happens as you knit. Some prior knitting experience would be helpful, but the projects are not difficult if one can read and follow directions. The book is well written and understandable and the projects are lovely. The styles are reasonably classic but fun, both to make and to wear. By ""classic"" I mean they will not go out of fashion like a passing fad. After investing your time in creating an item, you will be able to enjoy wearing it for many years. I am totally delighted with the book and will enjoy using the patterns and ideas for many projects. I highly recommend it."
2,This book needs a makeover!,"I have to agree with those who found this book wanting. I am an experienced knitter and while the photos and illustrations were well done, the instructions left a lot to be desired. I found errors and places where one had to assume the progression. Because this is a technique that is fairly new it is even more important that instructions be written for novice knitters as well as those who can on the fly create their own designs from a few moments instruction. I have sucessfully knit many Aran sweaters with complicated Celtic cables as well as other patterns. With this experience I find writing comprehensive step by step instructions requires a skill few designers seem to have. This could have been a first rate book, but I did not find it so."
4,New Techniques,"I loved Iris's book for the new techniques in it. I too hate to sew seams and with this technique, there are few seams to sew. The projects I've worked on have been great conversation starters with both knitters and non knitters."
2,Efforts doesn't always pay,"It seems that Cuica is the effort of 2 blokes (Simone Serritella & Pete Herbert), that wanted to create a Jazzy-Dance-Samba groove with strange beats and loops but trying to create the perfect disc they created a Frankenstein. Sounds and songs are very repetitive and dance-oriented with the brazilian flavor, but they weren't able achieve what they expected: too much arrangements and too much brazilian sound doesn't make a good record, sometimes the sound goes from the Chill-out to the Samba to the Dance and they just don't know how to finish the song, probably you can enjoy some songs in the record (the rest is kinda boring): track 3 (Mesmerizing), track 6 (double blues) and track 8 (night over vauxhall), out of this, doesn't worth to listen to."
2,Not worth the cash.,"I bought this on Webster today, and I just don't like it. The rubber base you're supposed to take off is a little too snug for quick removal. the Delete button on the unit is next to impossible to move. The pictures are too dark compared to what they originally were. It should have been USB, because too many things use the serial port, and USB would've been much faster, and USB hubs are easy to get.. The image quality is poor. The pictures load too slowly (1 picture takes 10 seconds, and it can hold 20). I've had trouble where pictures on the Webster get corrupted somehow, so they're unloadable, but the thumbnail view shows up (???). The only good I see in this product is what its meant for. Not worth the money, in my opinion. If you just want something to scan i-zone pics or other unneccesarily small objects, go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your time"
3,I bought this?,"woah, 1999 called.. and wants it out dated scanning tool back. - I don't even know where I have this damned thing. I know I don't have any of the cameras anymore. WHEN I did have the cameras, and this little doo-hicky, it worked like a charm though. I think I was under the guise of.. OOH LOOKY! SMALL AND CUTE!.Do they even still make these??"
2,The way we live,This book is Ginormous! I was super dissapointed with it overall. The cover suggests beautiful layouts and views into gorgeous decor's - so not the case...Loaded with boring photographs........
4,Solid and logical,"THE RESUME KIT is a great book that covers its topics in a very straightforward and conservative way. It contains everything you need to know, with a short section on cover letters, and doesn't include risky suggestions. Rather, he explains the risks of certain strategies, and why some strategies seem like good ideas, but aren't. There are many great sample resumes and it's really just a very comprehensive and useful book."
4,I remember when X-Files was the golden standard of TV on DVD,"Please put X-Files on Blu-Ray. I remember the first X-Files seasons being out on dvd in like 98 and wishing other tv shows got the ""X-Files"" treatment. Crap wasn't a season like $150 back then. Why can't we get this on Blu-Ray!I remember watching Dod Calm like 4 times in a row....First episode I ever watched on TV was Darkness Falls.I miss the Lone Gunmen.And John Dogget was awesome"
5,It is taking long time...,"Come on, it is taking so long, I am getting old :).. Release the bluray version with everything that was inside the DVD whole series collection with all the interviews, special features and more and I will be happy.. I love X-Files and still watched some reruns on tv. One of those TV Shows that was really thought out it is a blend and mixture of scifi, mystery, action, adventure, friendship, love and some comedy (Bad Blood) and dry humor of course.Is it really going to be release in Bluray anytime soon? I want to believe...."
5,A masterpiece that deserves a quality collector's edition,"Even if it's not touched up to HD standards (which for many reasons would be quite involved, especially with the earlier seasons), the X-Files remains a landmark series for the sci-fi genre and television in general. It deserves a quality collector's edition and the DVD release just fell short. The storage capacity of Blu Ray can be leveraged to fit the series onto a reasonable number of discs (ie, less than 60+) and would give Fox a chance to not botch the quality control (just google around a bit, of the DVDs in the collector's edition some would invariably fail out of the box as plenty of people can attest.) Even if it's just the straight SD versions put on to Blu Ray I'd buy it if they could assure that all the discs would work. Fewer discs would be a lot more convenient too."
5,Still Waiting,"I have ALL the previous DVDs for every X-File ever produced I think, but a BluRay set would be awesome. Scully in HD... sign me up!"
3,OK.....but,"Fine product, but had to fabricate to get it to attach and be stable on my moms' walker. As long as you have a little DIY skill, this is a fine buy."
1,Very disappointed. Not as described,"The description made it sound like it would fit any walker. My sister had a standard type walker, but when we put the basket on it was loose and hung at an angle. Didn't fit at all."
3,Old one was better,"I had the same sprinkler, but an older model. The newer one isn't as sturdy and I can't seem to control the area to be used as well as the old one."
1,very frustrating,"The track did not fit together very well, it left small gaps between each piece. The batman car did not make contact with the track 90% of the time. The contacts for the batman car was made from braided wire (not a very good design). I have a 6 & 8 year old that played with it for about 15 minutes before becoming frustrated. I played with it and I also could see thier frustration level.The batman idea is a neat way to suck you in to buying this product, but don't waste your time."
1,waste of money,"Don't buy, I got this toy for christmas for my Batman fan and what a disappointment to me and him. opened it the day after christmas and the batman car would not go around the track I went to toys r us and waited on line for 45 mins to exchange for another one which they had and when I got home, yet another disappointment same thing happened , needless to say my son was very upset. WASTE OF MONEY - BUYERS BEWARE"
1,Do not buy this!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this for my 8 and 5 year old sons for Christmas. It has NO power at all and seems to be junk. As all parents know, its so hard to disappoint on their faces over something Santa bought."
1,Does not fit AIREX Coronella mat !!!,"I purchased this yoga mat bag to hold an AIREX Coronella mat. However, the rolled up mat was too large to fit in this Yoga mat bag (unless you were to take 20-30 minutes squeezing and pushing to get it in). Don't buy this mat bag unless you plan on only using a thin yoga mat."
5,"""The True Queen Of Disco & Soul""","Linda Clifford is a true star! She has a warm & rich voice and can sing anything. Her covers out shine the originals and she makes them her own. Linda put real soul in her music,even her disco songs. These may not be her best,But they are worth buying. Was this review helpful (yes) or (no)"
5,best vocalists,"From the Twin Cities, these vocalists have all had very successful solo careers, but every year they get together and sing as a group, for old times sake, usually to help a charitable cause. They are wonderful, gifted people and the harmonies are second to none. Their holiday CDs are my favorites, and hard to find."
3,If you Meditate in Nature you may like it,This was just too slow for me - gorgeous description and exquisite detail - more than I need - about some of nature's realities - I know folks who love it - I did not - Had to force myself to finish
4,Very Depressing Viewing,"Nil by MouthThis is definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting is top notch but I get no pleasure at all from watching the dregs of society - drunks, junkies, wife beaters, bullies & utter boneheads going about their business. Only the women in this film have any sense of morality and right and wrong. The language is strictly from the gutter and adds perfectly to the portrayed pond lives that are using it.Of course, this is how some people really do live their lives but entertainment it is not. It would make a decent documentary I suppose but as a film I won't be watching it again, nor will it linger on the memory for too long either. Once is quite enough!"
5,very decent business card case,"Before I bought this case, I first tried a leather business card case since I wanted something that would feel comfortable in my pocket. The leather case was not a wallet and was made just for business cards. However it was way to flexible and, therefore its ability to keep my cards crisp was at a minimum. This metal card case is much smaller and yes even lighter then the leather one. It slides easily into my pocket and is not intrusive. It is a great looking case that attracts attention when I use it and keeps about 20 cards pristine. It seems to be very well made aa well. The only concern I have is that the metal may scratch if the case ends up in the same pocket as my keys. The packaging was very nicely done and shipping was prompt. A very decent business card case..."
5,Classics in any language,"Vikki Carr's first Spanish album on Columbia redirected her career, lifting her from the pack of standout pop artists into a stands-alone category. This ravishingly gorgeous album was unsuual in that it focused on contemporary material rather than the expected Spanish standards. The arrangements are superb and Carr's singing never less than thrilling. ""Hoy"" was a beautiful followup. Together, the albums are sublime."
4,Musical Album,"Woderful rerelease, on a CD, of two musical albums performed by Vikki Carr. I bought this CD to replace the vinyl versions of the albums which I can no longer enjoy."
5,Emotional,Vikki Carr has one of the most beautiful voices. She brings something special to her latin music. Her style of clarity and emotion is truly moving!
1,American music with spanish lyrics,"I don't like this album. Good music has an strong effect on the listener, but this album is not good, and the music does not ""send"" the listener anywhere. I own, and am a fan of, music by Lucha Villa, Vincente Fernandez, Luis Miguel, Roberto Carlos, Jose Jose, Nelson Ned, Los Iracundos, Los Bukis, and Eydie Gorme. So for an american, I think I am familiar with, know and appreciate spanish and mexican music as well as most. And I'm telling you, this album is not ""it"". The long and short of it, is that the music does not ""send"" you. That may be a subjective judgment, that is, unique to the listener. But I think that my feelings areshared by lots of listeners, who for some reason are not represented in this reviews section. If I were to analyze the music, I would say that it sounds to me americanized, in an overdone Doris Day sort of way. Its mexican or spanish soul is absent. In its place, I would recommend Eydie Gorme."
1,Whinefest,"All he does is whine and moan about everything he comes across. He tries way to hard to make stupid jokes...ever heard of editing. Edit some of the 50 to 60 puns and lame jokes out and maybe, just maybe it could be funny. Maybe the show would be better if he didn't try so hard to be funny and he wasn't such a wuss. Who named this guy a bad boy? Just because he smokes and drinks doesn't make him a ""bad boy"", toughen up Anthony and quit your whining."
1,"Awful, dull and extremely lame","Overall you would have to say that this series takes a extreme political position towards the left. Its less of a food or travel show as it is a political airing of a drunk, usless washed up loser the main protaginst Mr. Bourdain. Its unfortunate after a promosing first season this show quickly crumbled in its second season and this season is no different."
2,IT COULD OF BUT IT DID NOT.,"Evergrace first and formost was born to late, it may have been special if it was released 7 years ago, but it was not so here we have a PS2 game with ps1 graphics it's a sure recipe for failure, then we have the sound by the way it's not really sound it's vernacular sound distortion.This not for a gamer maybe for a 8 year old kid who have never played any RPG's it's no zelda or final fantasy.However i kinda enjoyed this game so forget the bad review you can certianly give it a try, you may like it's barbie appeal well laterz folks and gamers"
1,worst game in all,this was one of the worst games i have ever played.graphics and storyline are horrible.DON'T EVEN WASTE 5.00 RENTING IT!
2,!!WARNING!!,Evergrace is a RPG. A bad one though. The medioker graphics the [poor] story the total absence of crativity and fun all lead up to one thing... don't buy this rushed title.
3,A Fairly Good Game for its time........,"Yes, I understand this game came out pretty much cose to the same time the actually PS2 did. From the same company as Eternal Ring (another PS2 RPG), this game isn't that bad. I don't own, but I rented it from my local blockbuster. I was expecting alot better than it actually was, but hey, it wasn't all that bad. This is the first review I have ever written on amazon, so bair with me. I mean, now, there are tons of better RPG's out for the PS2, but keep in my mind, it was one of the first, and had nothing to compete or compare with. The graphics are pretty good. I'd give them a 4 star. Gameplay, just a LITTLE repetitve, but not too much, I also give that a 4 star. But the controls are yucko. I give them a 3 star. Anyways, my advice, rent before you buy. Some people may like it, some may not. It's one of those middle games."
2,Not a Good Start,"While the original cut scene is pretty and promising, the game lacks. The plot has holes, the game is easy, the dubbing is terrible, and its too short. It had potential to be good but someone really cut corners and production time on this game. I really hope PS2 comes out with some better games than this."
5,3D Old school goodness for your PS2,"It's so easy to pick a game to shreds..King's Field it isn't, but that's a good thing. First thing you'll notice is you get two games in one. You can play two main characters in the game (one male the other female) and the adventure for each is quite different. Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable game with good eye appeal and playability, so I'm left scratching my head as to why all the bad reviews.. with so many game titles out there that are much worse (and more expensive) - try this, you may like it."
4,"SOME GAMES ARE STUPID, BUT THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD","When I first started playing ""Evergrace"" I thought the buttons were confusing, but I got used to them after a while. I found the game to have good graphics. And since I was constantly running in to different monsters and challenges, it kept me interested. Also, having the opportunity to have different and better armor and weapons along with magical powers made me want to keep playing. The plot was a little strange though. Other than that, I found it to be a good game."
1,The REAL deal,"This is perhaps the worst rpg ever written. The combiniation of unoriginal game play, and an absolutely detestable story line your money would be more well spent on .5 pencil lead. Fear not however, if you bought this game rest assure that this WAS a playstation 1 game that was rushed into PS2 service if only to fill the vaccum created by the lack of RPG's in Song's repitore. The only thing sader than is PS1 polygons, is the lack of a clear involving story line. However bad the story is on most RPG's it doesn't seem to matter by the time you find a place to save you are completly encompassed by the plot, the developers of this game must have DELIBERATELY attempted to make sure by the time you got to level 2 you would be using the the cd as a steady, reliable, non-slip drink coaster!"
1,This Game is Horrible,This game is one of the worst I've ever played with the execption of Catfight. Do not make a mistake do not buy this game.
1,Totally AWFUL!!!,"my gosh!!! The whole little movie in the begining was bad, and I totally didn't understand it at all. If I had a choice I think I would give this game a 0, and I'm sure Japan can do a lot better than that! The graphics were great, and everything else was great, but the story line I must say sucked! So if your planning on buying this, SAVE YOUR MULAH FOR SOME OTHER good game!!! like ATV Ofroad Feary 2 or Midnight club 2!!!Gentle Goddess"
4,Rushed RPG Launch Title,"Evergrace is a boring RPG title which was rushed so it could be a PS2 launch title. If it wasn't a launch title, no one would have looked at it twice. Basicaly, they put their ... out as a PS2 game because there was a small selection of 30 games and they thought they'd have a good chance of selling their game. Bottom Line: Skip. There is supposidly a Mediocre sequel to this game with a different name. If you must play an evergrace game, play that."
4,easy to play RPG,"This game was very fun because the fighting style and storyline are very easy to get into.I also like that there wasn't any textto read wich makes the game more easy to like. If you like think the turn based fighting style is to hard, then you'd like this as an RPG."
4,It isn't as bad as the other people say,"Well, first of all, I originally got Summoner, whichREALLY[wasn't very good]. I ended up buying Evergrace, not expecting much. On the whole, though, it isn't a bad game. You don't really get emotionally involved with your characters, but you DO get caught up in beating the various monsters. I haven't finished it yet, but it's an engaging game, and it has kept my interest."
2,It sucks.,Evergrace is a very annoying game. It has horrible graphics. Bad voice acting and you have to have your power bar full to attack. (which is very very annoying)Graphics:2/10. I think they're the worst I have ever seen on the PS2. The people are blocky and fuzzy. Resident evil 3 for the ORIGINAL playstation had better graphics. Even the movie Graphics are lame.Sound:3/10. Horrible voice acting and cheasy music. I expected so much more for the PS2.Control:3/10. You even have a power bar for running! And beileve me. It's just as annoying as it sounds.Pros:uhhhhhhhhhhhh......Cons:Horrible graphics.Annoying power bars.Bad voice acting.More annoying power bars.
5,Outstanding....,"This CD has song after song of outstanding tunes. Like the previous reviewer, I heard first heard the Weekend Players on KCRW. The into the sun track is especially good. I highly recommend this CD you won't be disappointed..."
4,Weekend Players,"I bought the album because I heard the song ""Jericho"" on my local smooth jazz station and liked the song. The rest of the album is quite interesting, but the best part is the song ""Jericho"". It is quite haunting."
5,A wonderful album full of excellent songs.,"I have not heard of Weekend Players before but I will certainly be looking out for more material by them. Rachel's voice and Andy Cato's music are a perfect match. There are songs here that have great lyrics and superb tunes. My favourites are Jericho, Angel, Higher Ground and I'll be there.I guarentee that once you have listened to this album you will want to repeat it again and again.Stunning."
4,Gee kinda reminds me of Groove Armada,"Balancing dancier songs with more chilled out one, lots of females vocals over lazy chords and amazing dub lines? I wonder why they sound similar. This is a great debut and the bonus remixes are excellent as well. At this price pick it up it's definetly worth adding to your collection."
1,Not really that special,"Talk about an overrated album. Uninspired drums and synthesizers coupled with an insipid vocal track. Sorry, just doesn't get my adrenalin pumping. Of course, maybe you have to listen to the album five or six times to ""get it."" I took a few new CDs along on a drive through the Poconos last weekend in a pursuit of happiness but I could endure listening to this disc only once before replacing it permanently with Deep Forest's Comparsa, an exquisitely soulful collection of tribal melodies that really connected me to the scenery, enticing me to explore my strange new surroundings. All the songs on the Weekend Players disc just sort of blend together, and are bland together. After reading the reviews on Amazon I had high hopes for ""Jericho"" but it's better on Caia's The Magic Dragon."
1,Broke witin a week.,"This yo-yo was awful. after the original friction stickers wore, i bought some more friction stickers from the duncan website. after putting on the new friction stickers, the string would slide off the ball bearing and i would have to keep taking it apart and putting the string on the ball bearing.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,not what I expect,The moisturizer did not do much for my skin but it's not greasy. I have better result with the cheaper olay moisturizer. The pump seems convenient but you can only use about 2/3 of the content since 1/3 of the cream sticks to the side and couldn't be pumped out. I prefer the jar so you can get all the cream. To avoid contamination use a Q-tip or a tiny spatula (like those in Chanel skin care products).
4,My husband loves it but I can't use it.,"I bought this moisturizer for myself because it was highly rated on a skin product review site. After about 3 days I started having a reaction to it and had to stop. It made my face itch. If I hadn't had the reaction I would have continued to use it because it is light, non-greasy, moisturized by skin and had good sun protection. My husband started to use it and he loves it. He has been using it for several years now."
1,Bad!,"the seller send me a book ""new"" with notes on it...in chinese!at least he could take an eraser and make it better, don't you think?"
3,Didn't know what I was getting...,"Not knowing what I was buying, I thought I was getting a video capture card. Not so -- apparently you need a video capture card to plug this card into. I write this as a warning to others who may be thinking they are getting a video capture card. I'm sure it is a good item, but not what I wanted."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","After reading a couple of good reviews for this book, I found a used copy and plunged in. After I was done, I wasn't really satisified with the book. While some ideas were good, others were flawed or good but weren't taken to their fullest.The general plot is ok in the beginning of the book, but about halfway through it just begins to take some strange twists and turns. And after awhile it just gets wierd. Another reviewer complained that the book is a combination of several different styles, and I have to agree.While this isn't a bad book, it also is not a great book. This is the kind of book that you can read and get some laughs. Avid Sci-Fi readers will get some chuckles from some in-jokes or references to other book series by other authors. It's decent, but really can't hold it's own against others in the genre."
4,Unexpected and unguessable,"I thought I knew what I was getting into when I got this book. I can usually guess plot lines, but not here! Excellent writing with satirical wit."
4,Traditional Gaelic music,"Before they became household names and collaborators with the famous, the Chieftains started out as an all instrumental traditional Irish band. I was lucky enough to pick up this in a perfect shape vinyl about a year ago (so I can't speak to the quality of the CD sound). The music here is old fashioned Gaelic music played on old fashioned Gaelic instruments and played very well. Those who enjoy this type of music will be very pleased with this."
2,tooo easy,"Bought this hoping to have a little guidance to get myself moving. I guess I need something a little more heavy duty, as this was way too easy. Good for an elderly person that needs to move more."
2,Senior Exercises,I didn't care for it as there was too much talk between exercises and just went too slot for me.
5,book was great,"The book was quite comprehensive and alone more than enough to take and pass the exam by a GOOD margin. You CAN pretty much just read through this book, do the examples, and pass this exam. You cannot just read the book and pass the exam if you are merely memorizing answers and have no thorough knowledge of why certain answers are correct while others are not. Java is a very cool language. Take the time to understand it. If you're only goal is to merely pass the exam then you've missed the point."
4,Right on the money,"We are using the this book to get 100+ certified Java programmers in our Java Practice. This will help us reach our goal of becoming the Java service provider of choice. So far, we have 60+ certified Java people. Also, about 98% passed the Sun exam on their first try. This book is helping us to achieve our goal of becoming a world class Java practice."
4,Excellent Reference,"Excellent source of information for all the certification needs. Basics are explained crisply.But the only problem with the book being the CD and its coverage of API. Eventhough the 'Tester' in the CD very much resembles the actual testing interface, the questions are the same you find at the end of the chapter which makes no sense of writing the test in the first place. Secondly I felt that the API's included in the book made it much Bulkier and was not much of a use to me.But even inspite of all these, It is an Excellent Book and I recommend the people to use 'Exam Cram' as the supplementary to this book."
2,A waste of money,"Don't buy this book. It is a fast update of a previous edition leaving way to many errors in the text. The provided tests also contains errors, some of the questions are about AWT - a topic no longer on the test. And the samples promised by the text is not on the CD ROM as otherwise told.All this leads to frustrations and I recommend you not to buy this book"
4,Practice Makes Perfect,"As a comparison of the three books I've read, they are all very good but none are excellent.However, they all stress how important practice is... Well, if you have to hand type sourcecode, then you probably won't get much practice.Title: Complete Java 2 Certification* Publisher: Sybex* Techically: Good - slighly better than the other two books* Source Code: Hand type from book or Acrobat filesTitle: Java Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2* Publisher: Syngress/Osborne* Techically: Good* Source Code: Copy and paste from HTML filesTitle: Java 2 Certification* Publisher: MacMillan/New Riders* Techically: Good* Source Code: Copy source code directory from CD"
3,"Fair, Not Perfect","has lots of stuffs in, including both Programmer Exam and Developer Exam. Very thick book, about 1/6 are Indexes and Appendix.Content is Good, but not so good for Exam. Some of the very important part of the java exam are not emphasized in the book, i.e. Inner Class, etc. Some not so important part are talked a lot, like AWT classes, etc.."
3,Only if you already know java,"This book is a good book to read some days before the exam to remember all the stuff. But you need to leanr java somewhere else. There are no working examples, no ""real world application""...just a long list of rules, very difficult to remember if you don't know java or you don't have programmed for a while. If, on the other hand, you already know java and simply want to take the exam...this book is the fastest way to understand what they will ask you.p.s. I apologize for my english...I'm italian :-)"
2,Only good for first part. Second part isn't very good,"The first part which is the Programmers certification ismarvelous, but since I got to the Developers Certification, ... . The author is assuming a lot of stuff and providing incomplete source code and descriptions. Even the CD-ROM doesnt have any source samples.So I guess for the second part we have to find some other good book."
3,Not enough,"The book is not enough for exam. It is far too basic. It definitely is not a ""complete"" study guide for java progremmer certificate exam; especially for server side java programmer, I/O and awt are too weak in this book. Don't depend on the book for exam. It cost you at least $300 to pass the exam"
2,It is just too far away from real Exam,It is hard to pass the Programmer Exam if you just study this book. It is just too simple and sometimes misleading.
5,Excellent ! But .....,"No doubt this is one of the best books for Sun certificaion. This book excludes ""Grid bag"" lay out from programmer's objectives. In the real exam I came across atleast one question about ""Grid Bag"" layout. One questios does not sound big deal but it is big deal in tough exams like this. I know people who failed by 3% (roughly 2 questions). Also this book is not very good for Developer exam preparation."
3,Content doesn't match 1.4 objectives for programmers exam,"In my opinion this book was published too soon. Inside the front cover lists the objectives of the exam, but the content of the book does not mirror these objectives. Chapter 9 on Input/Output is no longer part of the exam. The programmer's final exam still includes AWT questions which are not part of the exam. Having both this book and the second edition it is surprising how little has changed, though the exam essentials is a good addition."
3,A Java Certification guide book but not enough.,"This is a very good companion book for Certification Exam, but definitely not enough. I just got passed my Certification and the real Certification test was way more difficult than the practice test in the book; But the key strength of the book is it keeps you focused on the subject matters; the only thing is the book has a lot of typos and some answers in the test exams are incorrect, so got to verify each one of them. Learn the core fundamentals and practice, practice, practice. Overall, it was worth it to have a book like this as a coach."
5,The Final Book to be read before the exam.,"I was preparing for the exam and had gone through a few books before I came across this book which was used by a friend who also got certified in java. I read this book in 6 days flat and it is amazing how this book concentrates on the Java 2 exam and is a must read. For staters to java this book must be read in conjunction to other books to get your concepts cleared in OOPS. For non-staters, I guess this book should be a fullstop. I cleared the exam with 83% in my first attempt.Great book."
5,Best study guide for the certification exam,I studied this book two weeks and passed the test easily. I think it is the best study guide that you can find in the market. I strongly recommend this book to programmers who are willing to write the test. The material necessary for the test is clearly and precisely discussed and presented throughout the modules. The only thing that I would like to criticize is the practice test on the CD-ROM which is the repeating of test questions found at the end of each chapter. I could not find any reason for that.
2,Poor Quality,This book is the worst book for the exam. You would be better off useing online study guides. The CD the book comes with contains out dated exam questions that contain AWT and Input/Output IO content. The book it self contains some good info but seems like a rush job. The chapter summarys are some times at the end of the chapter other times they are scatered with in the chapter at the end of individual sections. Their is also a chapter in the programmers section on I/O that doesn't pertain to the exam. Authors excuse is that it is preping for the Developers exam. HELLO!! Put it in the developers section!
4,Not a bad choice for success,"I passed these exams a few months ago and as I now look back and see my continually growing library of IT books and certification guides, the Sybex books simply stand out from the others.The book is pretty much on the mark for what the exams test. Having now completed my MCSE, Java, OCA and Linux++ certifications, I can honestly say that a combination of the Sybex guides and Self Test Software test exams will get you a pass mark in any of these certifications."
5,A must-have for the exam,"I've been programming in Java for a couple of years, but I don't think that experience alone is what helped me pass the exam. I credit some of my success to this book. I read each chapter, worked through all of the questions and walked through the code. The book helped to ingrain all of the nuances of the language that you don't necessarily have to think about in every day coding. The exam was really a test of your programming and debugging ability, and ability to find errors without depending on compilers or other aids. This book was accurately reflected that focus and did an excellent job of preparing me for the challenge.I have just begun working on the assignment for the developer's exam - and the insights this book provides have proven helpful thus far.This book is not for beginners. The test is not an easy matter of straight memorization. If you're serious about preparing and buy no other book - buy this one."
3,Review questions are far too easy,"I haven't sit for the test yet and I'm not confident enough after reading just this one book. I got all the review question at the end of each chapter right and it was a major dissapointmet when I found myself unable to answer many of the questions on the mock exams. I've done many othe mock exams on the net getting just around 70%, so I decided I need another book. This book might be good just for getting an initiall preparation for the exam but it defently lacks deph on details must likely to come up in the real thing."
2,Don't buy this if you want to pass the test,"Haven taken the Sun Certified Java 2 Programmer Exam, I guarantee that you will not pass the exam by using this book as a study guide. Confusing and down-right wrong examples in the programming area will lead you down a road to failure. The publisher has deceptively bloated this book by filling half of it with the Java API. Thanks.I have no experience with the developer exam so I cannot comment on that portion.This book may be of some value in learning the concepts on the exam but not for passing it.Try Exam Cram, unless there's a big hole in your bookshelf that you need to fill."
3,just enough,"this book will help to understand fundamentals but you will need some more to pass the exam.also the sample test in this book is not much helping. this book surely has some missing parts, hence for passing in first attempt you need another book."
4,"Good book, but not enough","This is good book to start with. Combine this with the ""Exam Cram"" by Bill Brogden. But reading these books is just not enough. Try writing sample java code using JDK1.2 to reinforce your concepts. Apart from this, try the mock exams available on the net. This will help you remember the points that you might have overlooked while reading the book or even while doing the project."
4,The Question are not as difficult as the real test!,"It's a good book and you get an indepth look into Java 2, but the Questions are not as difficult as the real ones. If you want hard questions, get the Java2 exam cram. Another thing, you get a Java testing engine with the book for simulating the test with 200 questions included, but the questions are all taken from the book, so where is the training?"
3,Don't Buy Just For Sun Certified Java Developer Exam,"This book will get the job done if you're using it to pass the SCJP exam. However, it is not at all helpful when it comes to the SCJD assignment. The book gets way too advanced when it comes to the SCJD part. It glosses over topics like distributed event notification, and creating a thread pooling mechanism. These things are not necessary for the exam at all and the book's explanations are way too generalized to help you understand them anyway. I found the book's style to be too formal and much less readable than the book by Kathy Sierra. If you're just taking the SCJP test, this book will work for you. But, if you're going for the SCJD, I recommend ""The Sun Certified Java Developer Exam With J2SE 1.4."" This latter book goes into way more detail and is much more helpful for SCJD."
2,lacking info,hey guys i passed the java programmer 1.4 exam last week ..this book was very poor in the following parts-garbage collection:there was alot of questions about that part in the exam which is not covered in the book-threads:the threads chapter in the book is very confusing and was not clear ..and the exam asked alot of questions that were not covered in the text.-Collection framework:the book does not cover this part well and the exam asks alot of questions about this part..other parts in the book are good what i recommened that you need another reference and this book is not enoughGood Luck !!Saedd
2,Useless. Covers the Wrong Material,"If you are planning on taking the 1.4 exam, the practice exam in this book is useless because it covers the wrong material. About 20% of the practice exam questions are on AWT and IO which are no longer included in the exam."
3,Wait for reprint!,"The following is from Sybex's errata:AWT in the Programmer's Exam and Final Bonus Exam on the CD. .""The inclusion of AWT in the Programmer's Exam and Final Bonus Exam on the CD was due to a production error. We are currently correcting the problem and placing the correct questions on the book's web site at www.sybex.com. Inclusion of AWT affects very few questions and the book will be reprinted soon with alternate questions. It's important to note that the questions on AWT are answered correctly and may be used by anyone taking a pre-1.4 version of the Programmer's Exam. We've included a chapter on Input and Output because knowledge of this subject is critical to learning good programming practices in Java and also in understanding Java well enough to take the Developer's Exam.""So Amazon, send the unsold books back and wait for the reprints."
4,A great book,"I found this book very helpful when preparing for the exam. It is well written and easy to read, with clear examples. However, I do agree with some other reviewers in that the real exam is a fair bit different, and the API in the back of the book is fairly useless (although it seems to be a prerequisite for Java books!)Overall, I found this book to be a great help."
2,a book need improvement,"Not clearly explain author's ideaFewer real code examplesDifficult to understand the book meaningWritten in a novel style, not like a technology bookWordy, not concise"
2,Not Rigorous Enough - Look Elsewhere,"I started out studying for the exam with this book. I quickly realized it was not detailed enough. I don't have a lot of Java experience, so I didn't feel comfortable with the amount of info I was getting. I switched to ""A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification"" by Mughal, et. al. I have never been happier with a book. It requires a large investment of time to get through it, but you will KNOW Java when you're done. It's taken me almost 3 months, but I feel very confident."
5,Learn and Pass the Certification exam,"This book (The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide by Simon Roberts,PhilipHeller, Michael Ernest) is good to learn Java 2, and it prepares you for certification exam. It guides you straight for the exam, no extra story to read. Other than this book you should read Java 2 Exam Cram by Bill Brodgen, William B., also take a good look at APIs and tutorial (when you down load Java, do down load documents also so you could get APIs and tutorial). Don't forget to practice on testing tool. Good Luck!"
4,OK...........,"This is good for any one who has only one thing on his mind, to become a ""Sun Certified Java Programmer"". This does not deal in great depth, the ease of programming and flexibility offered by the java programming language, but goes in and out of the certificate goals, the review questions at the end of every chapter gets you thinking. This is THE BOOK for JCP exam.... a must have............."
2,Sample exams on CD are buggy and wrong,"The exams on the accompanying CD are crap.The engine is buggy (sometime you cannot see the whole text) and answers are wrong. E.g.Q: ""Which access modifier will allow access only within the class and package?""A: ""friendly""Maybe friendly, but definitely wrong."
2,Provides a false sense of security,"I bought this book a couple of months ago, I studied it, did the tests after each chapter, sat the 'mock' exam on the CD-ROM, I was passing very comformtably, infact I was averaging about 95% on these test.However, when I actually sat the exam I found it to be much more difficult, and even in some instances there were questions in the exam on subjects not covered in the book (GridBag Layout for example).Therefore I feel that this book, though its content is good, provides a false sense of security about the exam. And as such, I find this book dissappointing. Unfortunatly now I'm in the situation of having to 'revise' on a few weakness and sit the exam again. If the book had portrayed a more realistic simulation of the actual exam then I might not be in this position.Be carefull if putting your faith in this book..."
4,Good enought to score but some topic is not cover,I manage to use this book and pass with a good rate. Anyway I found some of the topic is not cover or need to improve:1)Thread - join() (not cover)2)Array declaration - need more form3)interface - need more explainationHappy reading:-)
5,Great book,"The absolute best book in this area. Questions are right on the point. No errors (at least I did not notice any). The book is just great. And the CD is good too. If you get decent score on the mock-up exam, you are ready for the prime time."
3,nothing to write home about!,"Overall this book does a good job of giving you a well rounded look at the Java programming language, but it isn't detailed enough. That and it has quite a few errors! This book does an excellent job of covering the basics of some topics, such as, Strings and Threads, but other areas of the book leave a lot to be desired. Upon reading and studying this book you will NOT have mastered the basics of the Java programming language. Upon finishing this book, you might be able to pass the exam, but I would sincerely doubt it. I suggest getting a much more thorough study guide for the exam: ""A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification""."
4,Excellent book to prepare for exam,This book was invaluable in preparing for the exam and the 4 practice exams on the CD were very good. The only thing I want to mention is that this is not a book to learn Java - It has few examples and no exercises. Buy another book to learn the language (I recommend The Programmers Guide to Java Certification) and then buy this one to pass the test.
1,No good at all,This book is no good at all. Half the book is the useless API reference - who needs that junk? Those superficial chapters neither teach you JAVA nor help you practice for the test. Go get another book.
2,Many errors in the text but OK,"I don't like to read a 4th edition that have so many obvious errors in it. They should be gone by now. Most of the errors are only the text that have some kind of encoding errors which in this case means that a lot of the code samples that should contain "" instead shows . It is annoying to read strings like this: System.out.println(Some string). Also the disk that comes with the book contains these errors along with contradictions in the answers.I would try another book if I were You."
3,The Programmer exam has harder questions than this book.,"I just spent two weeks cramming for the programmer exam using this book. I passed, but I found the questions in the real exam much harder than the practice questions in this book. I do server sided java for a living, and I missed a number of the awt questions. I wish you luck with the test."
3,Good to start with.,"I found Robert/Heller to be a good book for someone who is just starting to prepare for certification. The basic concepts are clear enough for a beginner. But this isn't just sufficient. In order to pass the exam, I would suggest reading the Exam Prep by Bill Brogden along with this."
4,good book but falls short,"Definitely a good book for reference for Java2 certification, if studied one can for sure do at least 25 questions correctly. This book looks very bulky but thats becasuse of useless API index. AWT and IO are not delt properly, perhaps the most important drawback is the test questions, which are very very easy then the actual test and does not prepare for the test. A good pool of test questions can be found in Exam Cram, which could a perfect suppliment to this book.The best book that I can recommend for certification is Java Language Specification by James Gosling. Except AWT almost everything is covered and no question can go beyond this book."
3,"Warning: For the first time good, but not enough for test.","For the first time of preparing, this book is good. But if you want to get the certification, it is not enough. With the testmachine i scored 93% and in the real test, i got only 68%. The test is harder than the questions in the book. You need deeper Informations!For the certification as programmer, you need only the chapter 1-13."
1,It's not worth it.,"A third of this book is taken up with a list of class definitions and method signatures, but *without any comments or doc*. They are complete useless, and only serve as space filler. If you are trying program in Java, this book isn't much help either. It might help you pass the test, but you need another book to learn to program in Java."
1,it's over rated.,"i was told it is the #1 best selling JAVA exam stydy guide. after i went through it, i thought it was over rated. in this book, a lot of useless messages are presented just to fill up the space. for example, it can use half page to tell you primitives of double cannot be implicitly converse into int since it's narrowing conversion, and use another half of page just to tell you int primitives can be conversed into double types since it's widening conversion. all these kinds of junk is full of this book. also it can use a huge space just to put a figure such as pouring a coffee into a cap. it is not worth. if you want to buy a book on java certification exam, it's better find another one."
2,Good but not comprehensive,"I just took Sun's JAVA 2 Certification test, and I failed horribly. I studied this book for a good six weeks, and knew it well. When I took the test, I knew some of the questions right off the bat, remembering exactly what I had read in the book. Then there was the other half of the test. I was reading labels of classes, layouts, and packages that I had never even seen in the book. It was a disaster. I should have looked for a more comprehensive book to study from. Now I have to spend another $150 to take the test again, because this book was insufficient."
3,Brief touch of exam objectives,"I bought this book because so many people seem to recommend studying this book. It seems to cover almost every topics for the exam but it didnt give me a thorough, satisfying explanations for most of new topics(for me understanding thread and event handling stuff was so hard.) I think this book touches exam topics for those who have studied Java for at least few months. For beginners, I dont think this book is enough to understand the complicated topics and features of Java. I'd recommend for beginners to read more thorough Java programming books then before the exam read this book."
3,Bood Material; Lousy Software,I could have given this a 5 star but the software included with the book is a pain to install... Which I believe can be done much better.The book is also thicker than necessary because of the list of Java classes. This list should have been ommitted or placed in the CD-ROM.
4,This was all I needed!,"I studied this book carefully twice through and passed the exam easily. It may not be perfect, but it was all I needed."
4,Good One,"This is a great book for the exam. But remember it is not for the beginners.It is only for people who have some level of comfort with OOP. Remember, every line and word in this book makes sense. So be careful not to miss anything as you read.Also this book alone would not help. You would definetly have to suppliment this with Exam Cram from Bill Brogden. Great Buy ."
4,"Its great, but a little unstable...","As a relative newbie to the modern PalmPCs (my last device was an old 2mb black and white Psion 3c) the Cassiopeia was a really pleasant surprise. The colour screen is wonderful, the sound and video quality are great and the connectivity with my ancient laptop is slow, but very convenient. The only flaws are the occassional hang ups of WinCE, a slightly low battery life, and the very slow parallel connection to your desktop. Also, with only 32 megs of RAM its not as good for multimedia as promised on the box, but stick a couple of CompactFlash cards in there (as I intend to do very soon) and it should be wizzing..."
3,It is not as good as it looks,"I recommend buying a memory card.... the existing memory, if you install 2 or 3 more programs, is not enough... I have one week..."
5,Casio E-125 is a great choice!,"I purchased the e-125 as a replacement for an em-500 I had purchased and returned a few days before because the em-500 lacks a CF slot. The e-125 is to me a great choice of pocketpc. I don't notice an appreciable speed difference between the slightly faster ipaq and my new e-125. Also, the casio's better screen and better button-layout clearly make up the difference. I also purchased a CF ethernet card with my e-125 and browsing the net is clear, easy, and effective. This is a great machine that I would recommend to any prospective buyer."
5,I love mine,"I use my E-125 for everything now - the usual PDA stuff, as well playing MP3's. It blows Palm right out of the water. I recommend loading yours with the following: - Transcriber from Microsoft - Handwriting recognition software. I like it better than the pre-loaded software that comes with it because it's easier and more flexible. - EZBeam from BSquare - Allows you to beam info back and forth between your Pocket PC and Palm OS devices. I was used to doing a lot of beaming of business cards and appointments with my old Palm V. Now I'm able to share info in meetings with all those Palm users."
2,Casio Blows their lead,"Casio, a leader in retail electronics and one of the first on the market with the Pocket PC (windows CE) device has sadly let their lead slip away. They remain the most expensive of the Pocket PC's and it's darned near impossible to find accessories. I have a Cassiopeia Pocket PC which I will keep but if I had it to do again, I'd save a hundred bucks and buy an HP or Compaq Pocket PC. Same quality, better price, and easy to find goodies like keyboards and cases."
3,E125 woes,"I have had a visor for over a year and I out grew it. Needed something with more. I bought my 125 a couple of months ago and I have been somewhat disappointed. I travel alot and I have a few computers that I sync with. I noticed though that every once in a while my data (notes, email, programs, and etc) would just disappear. The backup program gets about half way through before it gets stuck in a loop and never finishes (at least 10 tries ranging in 30 mins to all night to give it a chance). I am not sure what is the problem (guessing that it is activesync 3.1) but I never had those issues with my visor. I love the colors, ethernet, mp3 ability, and so on. Just hasn't been all that reliable."
5,This little unit Rocks,"Can't believe how they can get so much in so little space. I bought the 128mb storage card and in the WMA format, loaded over 100 of my favorite songs. Plugged into my outdated tape player in my car, through the headphone jack of the Cassiopeia and a casette adapter, this thing just rocks. It's much more than just an organizer, but I use it to know exactly where I've been and what I've done as far as work and billing my hours for payment. Battery life is phenomenal and recharging is a snap in the USB cradle, as well as downloading or uploading info to my desktop."
2,Poor customer service,"My screen cracked about 5 months after I purchased my E-125. I did not drop it or misuse it. I called customer service. They told me to send it back to the manufacturer with a check and it would be repaired in 5 - 10 working days. Today is the 16th working day. I called to check on the status and they told me it would be another 2 weeks before they would even begin to work on it. I'm very upset about this (obviously) and would recommend that future buyers purchase insurance against screen breakage, and check out the customer service ratings on other Pocket PC's. As for it's performance, I loved the E-125! I'm only dissatisfied with the CS. By the way, my check cleared my bank 2 weeks ago. They took my money, but they are unwilling to repair it under warranty, and they are still making me wait another 2 weeks or more."
5,Beautifully Done,"This is a must have for Tasha Tudor fans. It is beautifully done. It gives you a glimpse into the life of Tasha and a mind that is is rich with imagination and fantasy. It is the best of all worlds because it puts you in a Christmas mood, but it also is of interest to anyone who loves gardening, old houses, beautiful illustrations and animals. I would highly recommend it."
5,Great Service,A small business that does a great job. I particularly liked the personal contact immediately placing the order let me know my business and feedback were appreciated.
5,"Easy to Store, Perfect for Poker","This product is perfect for poker enthusiast who don't have a lot of space (aka apartment living). I can easily pull this out and set this up in less than 30 seconds, but when I'm done, I can throw it back in the case and put it neatly in the closet. The case also makes it convenient to take this to other people's house when it is there turn to host poker night."
4,Great Poker table,I bought this for my husband as a gift. He loved it! The shade of green color is great. The table is big and sturdy. Easy to storeway. We got nice compliments from our friends as well.
3,Inciteful,Great book full of information but a little too old as far as planning ideologies but still great book to read.
5,Excellent book on urban design,"Kevin Lynch descibes the visual attributes of cities and towns, paying special attention to how we find our way around, how we build a mental image of these places. It is not only relevant to city dwellers, but to anyone interested in the subject of creating communities, real or virtual. A truly wonderful book, with lots of insightful drawings and images. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointed,"I had heard this was a great book on the people of Appalacia. I purchased the book for my dad for Christmas. He's from the Kentucky/West Virginia area so I hoped he would be able to relate. I was surprised to see there was no representation of these areas in the book. It should have been called The Face of North and South Carolina. That would have been more accurate. The book on its own is ok, but not what I expected."
5,Great Jam,I loved finding this nice bag of Pectin for so reasonable. I have a Plum and Peach tree and this summer started getting tons of fruit which I shared with all my friends but decided to extend my crop by canning. I bought several little boxes of pectin in the store but they get pretty expensive. This nice large bag was enough to make 9 recipes of Jam and we love it. It tastes much better than store bought Jams. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who makes jams and I will definitely be buying it again next summer. Thank you!
2,If you like really really weak coffee...,"These pods deliver very weak tasting coffee. They include about 1/2 as much coffee as other pods you'll find on the market. When shopping for pods, always check the weight in addition to the pod count. If you like a stronger brew, I suggest the Melitta pods, they also come individually wrapped for freshness and flavor."
1,strong with no taste,"this doesn't taste like hazelnut at all, it's probably the less favorable of the senseo coffees. No matter how much sugar and creamer I put in it, it still tastes like bitter coffee. It's definitely not hazelnut."
2,Ash bucket,"Sorry, but I was disappointed in what I got for the money. I guess I was expecting something a bit more substantial than what I consider a sand bucket."
1,Software and Tech Support are really bad.,The hardware itself for this CD-RW isn't bad but everything else is terrible. The software needed to produce discs comes with little to no documentation and has multiple problems writing files. abCD (one of the packaged software tools) is suppossed to let you drag and drop files like a floppy disc but many times won't write to my CD - RW. The tech support advertises a toll free 1-800 number but after hitting re-dial on my phone over a hundred times (I kept getting busy signals) I was then put on hold for over 30 minutes - Then automatically hung up on because Sony had a high number of calls. RUN don't walk away from this bomb.
4,Excellent driver with disappointing software...!,"This is my 4th CD burner. So far, I have not been very happy with Sony CD burners since other similar burners such as Recoh and Plextor are simply better with small price differences. Anyway, I decide to give another chance to Sony, and I see a lot of improvement over past Sony CD burners. Although its recording speed is little bit slower than its competing burners, the difference is not significant, just few more seconds. It has no Burn-Proof technology, but 4Mb buffer is good enough, and I have burnt more than 30 CDs without single error. Its audio extraction rate and reading speed are excellent. However, its bundled softwares are disappointing since they are not easy to use and not as convenient and speedy as Adaptec's Easy CD Creator. I would more stick to Easy CD Creator. You should upgrade your Adaptec's Easy CD Creator to version 4.03 to work correctly with this driver. Overall, the dirver itself is excellent without Burn-Proof technology."
3,Updated rating,"I wrote the previous comments and after further review decided to upgrade the rating on this to 3 stars for the following reasons...I finally did get in to Sony's support line and spoke with one of the best support people I've every spoken with - VERY helpful and knowledgable. I was directed to some websites that contained the proper manuals for some of the software (called CD Extreme) packaged with this CD-RW. Ever since, I've been much happier with this unit. I would have easily given this unit 4 or 5 stars if it would have come with proper manuals (or at least tell me where I could get them) and if it was a little easier to get into their support line. But all in all the unit itself is solid and once you figure out the proper bundled software to use (my opinion: CD Extreme is good, abCD terrible) this is a pretty good package."
1,Garbage,"I won't boar you with the details of the week I spent in Sony Customer Service hell. Suffice it to say the drive was defective right out of the box, the documentation says it is Windows 2000 compliant (it isn't) and Sony offers no software update which is W2K compatible, only that they apologize for the mis-representation. Add to this their only remedy for the defective drive is to repair it in 20 to 30 days. So, I end up with a rebuilt drive (they specificaly said NO NEW replacements) after paying for a new one that does not meet the requirements of my operating system. Good Luck."
4,Oak headboard,"Exactly what I needed, If it were a few inches taller it would be a dressier appearance as mattress and boxspring take away from the style."
5,Sublime Folk,"There was a time in the 70s when British and Celtic folk music conveyed the passion that seemed to have evaporated the American scene. Steeleye Span,Five Hand Reel, The Chieftans,Pierre Bensusan, Alan Stivell, Fairport, Bert Jansch, and Richard & Linda Thompson. Plantxy's first solo effort is right up there with any of the aforementioned and remains one of my most cherished possessions. The exhuberant playing is uniformly transporting, and though Andy Irvine shares the vocals, it's Moore who carries me furtherest, and whose solo career I subsequently followed.(I can't understand why his self-titled album isn't on CD, while the less impressive'Prosperous' merits reissue)) Not a blotch on this Irish landscape though."
4,Cool Brazilian Jazz,"This is very mellow and relaxing music. Bebel Gilberto wraps you up in a very dreamy Brazilian mood. She has a very nice style all her own, but with obvious links to the past. This a very good CD. I look forward to hearing more from her."
5,Bossa Nova for the New Decade,"After discovering Antonio Carlos Jobim via the 1959 classic Orfeu Negro (Black Orpheus) in junior high school, I have been enamored with the Bossa Nova sound. Now as one of the founders (Joao) creation steps in and represents for us late 20's early 30's crowd...it is evident that Bossa Nova rules...Buy this album, jam number #2 (August Song) and imagine Carnival..."
4,Cool new Bossa Nova and simply delightful.,"This is Bossa Nova for the millenium - cool and sensous, and some new production technology. I love everything that Jobim and Joao Gilberto did, and this album harks back to those wonderful jazz-tinged sounds of Brazil. It's infused with the warm and sensual vocals of Bebel Gilberto and with the help of an excellent production team, Tanto Tempo is simply a class act. Check out ""Samba de Bencao"", ""So Nice"" and the title track, and prepare to be charmed."
4,Outrageously Good Brazilian Music!,"Bebel Gilberto's unassuming stab at modern Brazilian music are some of the best Brazilian songs I've heard since Elis Regina and Jobim. Exceptionally well produced and harmonized, Bebel's voice is the smooth banner of relaxation and inspiration.'Samba de Bencao', 'Sem Contencao', and 'Samba de Amor' carry her vocals well while 'Tanto Tempo' and 'So Nice' show her songstress sensuality. This girl is awesome!Highly recommended!"
3,"Competent , But It's Deju View All Over Again....","I seem to recall that one of the other reviewers of this album used the term ""Brazilian Elevator Music"" to describe Tanto Tempo. I won't go that far, but upon listening to it, it just doesn't excite me that much. And, I am listening to the CD as I write this. I wanted to see if my impressions from a few months back still held. They do.I am not really ripping this album apart. To each his/her own. I find it pleasant, but if Tanto Tempo were to vanish tomorrow I would not feel compelled to replace it. I feel as if I have heard this music before. It strikes me as being ""Generic Brazilian"" music. Fine to help set a mood, but it lacks the excitement of the early Getz-Gilberto collaborations. Bebel has a nice voice, but again, it seems generic. Bebel's stylings sound as if she listened to an early 1960's album of Brazilian bossa nova vocals and mimicked them to perfection. Enough said."
5,smokey loungey sexy bebel,"I'm a fan of brasilian music, and bebel's tanto tempo has become my favorite summer night with cigarettes and glass of cabernet CD. The first track is amazing -- i think it's written by vinicius (sp?) who's a legend himself."
4,Interesting Twist on Bossa Nova,"It's a mesmerizing album with Bossa Nova, pop and jazz mixed together! She's very different from her father's music...she has her own bossa nova style! I simply love this refreshing music and her languid, dreamy voice!"
5,Just Listen,"This CD will return to you however much attention you give to it. The musicianship is expectedly impeccable, the songwriting fluid and the vocals are pleasingly effortless.The nuances and subtle cross harmonies are apparent only if you give it a close listen. But even if you don't, the brazilian samba, bossa nova whatever melodies are sure to please."
4,You should pick this one up!,"When I bought this disc I wasn't completely sure what I was buying. I got it because I like other things from this label, and because of who Bebel Gilberto has collaborated with - Thievery Corporation, Amon Tobin and Mario C. (Beastie Boys) just to name a few. This disc is a perfect mix of familiar Samba with more modern sounds. The vocals are warm the rhythms are terrific. Those who enjoy the compilations released by the ESL record label won't be disappointed with this either. A great disc!"
4,Great and refreshing,"GREAT, simply put.A refreshing twist on bossa and Brazilian music. A perfect entree to Bebel if you have never purchased any of her CDs.Beware, however, that if you buy this her others are a ""tad"" behind this gem. (not to say they are bad at all, just saying this CD set the bar very high)."
4,A Voice That Drips Like Honey,"I just saw Bebel in concert last night, and she was marvelous. As is her CD. I give it 4 stars instead of five because I can't quite swallow the synthesized sound effects. I honed my love for bossa nova on old school albums, such as Getz/Gilberto, the standard for all bossa nova. Perhaps I'm just being old fashioned, but the wind sound effects, etc. just don't do it for me. That being said, it's an immensely listenable album. Bebel's voice is wonderfully mellow, and the music sways your hips gently. I would recommend this album for both long-time fans of bossa nova and novices, who are sure to find the CD relaxing and soothing."
2,Too Short,"I was really looking forward to this CD but was very disappointed when I realized how short it was. You barely get into the groove and then the song is over. The CD is over in a flash. Additionally, the recording is very poor technically. All around a big disappointment."
3,Interesting,"The CD contains a spotty collection of ""reworked"" bossa. And it's that annoying kind of spotty where each track has an equal share of good and bad moments, which makes me wonder if other reviewers only listened to the first ten seconds of each track. Bebel's voice may be beautiful, but it lacks what fellow Brazilians (Veloso, Gil, the other Gilbertos, Lindsay) seem to offer up when they sing- emotion. Still, if you've got the Brazil bug, ""Tanto Tempo"" has enough pleasing moments to warrant purchase. You might want to try ""Red Hot + Lisbon"", or anything from Arto Lindsay, especially ""Pride"", for better treatments of modern Brazilian grooves."
5,Don't Hesitate.....so relaxing & inspiring,"My husband & I do not know one word of Portuguese, but it doesn't matter. The music on this CD transcends all language. We thoroughly enjoy listening to Bebel Gilberto while having a glass of wine, as she offers us an opportunity for reflection or conversation of the highest quality. While listening, any task will be easily accomplished, as time just flies by....then, replay. I love every entry on the CD. Don't listen to the negative critics, (very few) and buy the album. You can thank me later....along with all the other reviewers who enjoy really good music; I trusted their reviews and they were 100% accurate."
4,Excellent Introduction to Bossa Nova,"This CD is a great introduction to Bossa Nova. Undobtedly this is Bebel's greatest work and one of the most solid Bossa Nova CDs. The smooth and percussive rhythms paired with Bebel's seductive voice makes this an excellent choice for lounging or chilling. My favorite track on here is Sem ContencaoMy second favorite is ""So Nice"""
3,good mood music,"This is a well-crafted bossa nova CD. It's lush, sensual sound is great to relax to after a long day, or week.Unfortunately I have a poor opinion of Bebel Gilberto herself, having recently seen her in concert at the Beacon Theater in New York. On stage her sexuality, such as it was, was calculating and at times unintentionally funny. She wore a slinky, provocative dress, but really showed no charm, no guile, no heart, no reason to want to fall in love with her. Her vocal range is limited, and one breathy song after another gets old after awhile, especially if there is nothing behind it. Bebel was totally upstaged at the Beacon by the opening act, Angelique Kidjo, who sang with verve, heart, and AUTHENTICITY! The CD is good, but if you want to see a good quality performance, forget Bebel, and go see Angelique!"
1,No good,"Bebel Gilberto has nothing to make it, absolutely no talent, but she still seems to be getting good reviews. I really wonder how...I listened to her album and saw her live at the Beacon Theater in New York: what's the hipe all about? She has no voice, no musical ear, and no presence on stage (half of the audience also left before the end of the show!). The idea that she is mixing the good old bossa nova (sacred) with electronic music is nothing revolutionary, and she doesn't even carry it well. Anyway, she is not the one playing the music, and being able to sing a weak tune in a microphone when she has heard bossa nova all her life is no talent to me! Disappointing, that's all."
2,Good voice lost in a misleading conception,"So they invented drum'n'bass. They define it as being Bossa Nova with a new beat. I tell you it's nothing at all. I think they could add new material to it if they really wanted to create something new.What's wrong here is to find that this is a new way of playing and feeling Bossa Nova. No, not absolutely, this is not Bossa Nova.Repertoire is good Brazilian music. Voice is fine crystal.Unfortunately this 'drum'n'bass' ensemble is just a passing wave.Ms. Gilberto owes us something better."
2,Too literal,"Ursula K. Le Guin usually imagines faraway worlds with societies and problems that resemble our own, but are usually unique enough to fascinate the reader. In ""The Telling"", her producer-consumer society seems too much like China in the cultural revolution, while the outlying mountainous region seems like a carbon-copy of Tibet, complete with old wooden monasteries being buldozed by the new regime. The religious Telling is slightly interesting but seems contrived, unlike the detailed portrait of Odo's anarchic society in the Dispossessed.And as with all her books, the ending is too convienient."
2,Trying to Be Fair,"A fan of Ursula K. LeGuin who loved THE DISPOSESSED might have the wrong expectations about THE TELLING. Gone are the intrigues of plot, the psychological complexities, the paradoxical choices. Instead we are presented with LeGuin's lucid poetic style and richness of image in the form of an allegory.There is nothing inherently wrong with political treatise, and certainly the criticisms LeGuin offers of our ""producer-consumer"" culture are valid. The solution she produces to the ""something-for-nothing"" dilemma of shared technology is well-supported as her plot unfolds. The problem is, this isn't truly a novel. How readers will respond to it will depend entirely on their expectations."
3,I'm Not Sure What To Think,"Ursula K. LeGuin is my favorite author, but I have to admit that this book dissapointed me just a little bit. I like books whose lessons I have to work for, so in that sense I was very pleased, yet it seemed all too laborsome to read through only to arrive at a breezy conclusion that, to me, constituted no more than a giant question mark. There's so much development towards the inevitable ending, but not much matter to tie it all together with. This is not to say, however, that I do not appreciate The Telling, just that I'd call it a guide into ones own thoughts before I'd call it a novel, which is perfectly fine if you consider the value of the insights which, after reading, one can gain."
2,"Thin, thin, thin","I am a great fan of Le Guin's. She writes beautifully and intelligently, and she always explores some interesting sociological or anthropological concept in her writings. But she normally has a good solid story that the concept lives within, as well as excellent character development. Not here! This isn't a concept living within a story, it's a philosophical tract thinly disguised as a story. And I didn't connect with the characters at all. All right, I speedread. I do that when I get bored. Maybe I missed something. But I'm not going back to look for it. Life's too short. I move a lot; I limit my collection of books, but ""Tehanu"", ""The Beginning Place"", and ""The Dispossessed"" have travelled thousands of miles with me. Not ""The Telling."" I'm only glad I got it from the library and didn't spend money on it."
1,Less Than Hoped For,"Slight. Dull. An apparent try at ' spare ' narative. Half-interested authors shouldn't be putting out books. Being that she is one of the few living authors I have enjoyed reading in the past twenty years, this is a true shame."
1,Terrible,"Unfortunately this book was my introduction to LeGuin and I don't think I will ever be able to read anything else she's done because of it. I'll keep the review simple; The Telling was pretentious, plotless and without character development. I also got the impression that LeGuin was feeling pretty clever when she wrote it. It comes across as a mere outline for a novel; unfinished and exceptionally boring to the point that I could not bring myself to finish it. Please don't start here as I'm sure her other works MUST be better than this based on her reputation."
1,"A different Le Guin, and not for the better....","I am a huge fan of several of Le Guin's earlier works, especially the Earthsea Trilogy, and many of her other ""early"" sci-fi/fanstasy works. However, I have found that much of her new writing has dwindled away from the class of good literature, into the realm of garbled preachiness, such as this book. In truth, I have read bad fanfiction that is better. I was terribly disappointed, as were others. I recently saw an entire stock of this book from a bookstore at a dollar store, because nobody was interested in buying it. I would say - read Le Guin's earlier works that include such masterpieces as The Tombs of Atuan, and leave her newer works alone, as they are no longer up to par."
4,an exploration of censorship and oppression,"The Telling by Ursula K. Le Guin is a lovely little science fiction novel. Sutty (born in India and raised in Canada) decides to become a researcher and leave the Earth of her time, which is in tumult from terrorist attacks from religious fanatics. She is sent to the world of Aka, where the new regime has systematically been destroying all traces of its original culture, history, tradition, and literature. But Sutty gets the opportunity to travel to a backwards mountainous region of Aka, and there she encounters the Telling, an oral tradition of the past...a deep and intelligent short science fiction novel that I really enjoyed.This is science fiction, but it is not space opera and it is not filled with action and adventure. Rather, it explores issues such as religious fantacism, oppression, and censorship through the lenses of history and the ""soft' science of anthropology."
3,"Good, but a bit of a let down","There's not much to dislike about the Telling. Like all of Ursula LeGuin's books, it's well written, it has some interesting ideas, and at times it's quite engrossing. The trouble is, though, there's not enough to like, either. The culture of Aka was fascinating - but I kept waiting for it to be developed further, and it never really was. The major characters had potential - but the reader never really got to know them well enough to care very much about them.Anyway, if you're a fan of Ursula LeGuin's writing, I'd reccomend picking up this book - it's a good read. But if you've never read LeGuin before, this isn't the place to start. Instead, get The Left Hand of Darkness, or The Dispossessed, or Four Ways to Forgiveness."
4,The telling,"1. too hard to read for non-English reader2. Very nice written, but by too much descriptive parts3. With more action would be more fun"
2,Wouldn't recommend it to a studeneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,The manual had some good information on radio communication but employed the use of multiple cards. This was verycumbersome while trying to fly the plane.
5,Simple and stright to the point,"This book is just what the Product Description says it is. ""32 script templates and accompanying instructions take the guesswork out of what to say to whom and when"" As a Sport Pilot CFI only a few apply to what I teach. I would recomend this Pad to any new flight student."
5,All we needed!,"This excellent guide got us there and back in one piece, with all the travel and cultural information we needed to have a rewarding trip. It is easy to read, adequately covers the region, and includes various budget options. More importantly, it guided us off the beaten track for diving, birdwatching, caving, and jungle-trekking (as well as for a ruins romp). While some of the prices and accomodations may now be dated, the book is still a gem for its coverage of the national parks and Belize's wide variety of natural treasures."
4,A fine guide,Explore Belize is packed full of helpful tips on planning a trip to and touring Belize and the outlying cayes. Extremely useful for finding off the beaten track spots.
1,Do not buy,"I should start by saying I already wrote a poor review for this product, but they cleverly changed the name, so it doesn't show up. This bench is junk. First off, the back rest has a 1 inch pad. Honestly, it feels like you're laying on a piece of plywood. The leg curl/ leg extension attachment has a j-pin that you put in to raise the seat pad up to perform both exercises. That pin bent, so I contacted them and they sent me a new one. The 2nd time using it, it bent. Without the seat raised, it is impossible to perform either leg exercise. I weight 185 lbs, so its not like i'm a huge man. This product is very poorly designed. Basically, this bench is worthless. Now i have to spend another $300 to buy a bench that actually works. I find is hilarious that 2 people gave this bench positive reviews. They must not lift much. DO NOT BUY THIS BENCH. Or anything from Yukon. You will regret it."
5,The Proof You've Been Loking For,"This book clearly disproves the protestant claim of ""Sola Scritura"". It provides 21 undeniable reasons why Tradition (Catholic Church), along with scripture, provide the complete truth. I recommend this booklet to all Catholics who need to strengthen their faith and all protestants who are sincerely seeking Truth."
5,It's all right,"""The Cookcamp"" was a heart-warming story about a boy being sent to the home of his grandma, who he never met before in his life and his crazy mother just went and sent him there anyway without saying anything to the boy. When he arrives, he feels like his mother just dissed him like he was nothing. So after a few weeks of spending time with his Grandma, he felt like he was more than something! Then all of a sudden, his mother wanted him back. Then he go back home, the place he didn't like to go to. So that's what his forgetful mother does to him and that shows HOW MUCH SHE LOVES HER ONLY CHILD(HER ONLY SON)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I recommend this book because it's a heart-warming story because of what happened to the boy."
5,I LOVE THIS MACHINE!,"Mix N' Blend IIBlendTec Mix n' Blend II Mixer/Blender - K-tec Mixer / Blender ComboI LOVE THIS MACHINE!I make alot of bread and bread products and I have had no mixer that compares to this one. This machine is loud (it is a big job machine) but wow, does it get the job done. An ""Auto Knead"" feature...what a great idea...I've had many, many different stand mixers and this one is top of the line and my favorite. This mixer does it all and it's light weight compared to others. This machine takes up very little counter space compared to other machines in its class.I'm in Love...Thank you BlendTec for making a stand mixer that does far more than what it claims and is worth the investment!This is the stand mixer we've all been searching for..."
1,don't buy it,"This is cheaply made plastic. It arrived broken. I sent it back and bought a Vitamix which I LOVE!!!!! Just buy the Vitamix. It's expensive, but totally worth it."
2,Works great when it works!,"I have owned this mixer for about 7 years. I used it mainly for frosting and cakes, and the first time I tried to make bread 5 years ago, the gears all stripped out. We called the company, and were told that we couldn't buy the parts. $350 down the drain. My husband finally talked to a manager who sent us the plastic gears that we needed. I made lots of bread over the next few years and was generally happy with the mixer, (the blender was nice too, except that the plastic has started to crack around the blades) last Feb. I decided to make sugar cookies, and the gears stripped out again. After all of the trouble it took to get the parts last time, I'm giving up... Time to move to my original plan and get a Bosch. My mother's has run without a problem for almost 30 years. That is what I expected... not what I got. A mixer this expensive with such lofty promises shouldn't break so often. I tried to go American made, and have been disapointed overall."
1,"Pretty but did not work, Cute but no sigar","This item is cute, and sits well on the counter, but functionally for me it did not work, the motor began to smell after my first 20 seconds strawberry smoothie, don't ever try to make soup or ice-cream I don't know, maybe my unit was defective, Blendtec is a good company, but this particular unit left me disappointed, I love the look, the dual function was great, but to get the unit to do work was another thing, the motor just overheated every single time.I am ordering the new :Designer Series WildSide, they promise stronger motor, upgraded cooling, and capacitive touch panel, we will see, yep we will see."
2,Fiestaware should stick to plates,"I love Fiestaware almost as much as my kids, but tablecloths are NOT their forte. This piece shrinks almost 50% unless you wash it by hand. The design is slight and it looks and feels like it came straight from a street bazaar in India. It doesn't work with my urban, mid-century modern decor."
3,So far so good,"I have tried it with hasitation.however,I do not find hair in my hands when I water wash my head in the morning.I guess one goal is already in.I trust the product stops hairloss, but I strongly believe no product today can regrow hair in questioned areas."
2,rent it don't buy it,"I decided to rent this game and see if it was any good. I beat the thing in four days. I was very dissapointed in the end boss and the ending. The talking sequences sucked. The only thing i liked about the game is the fact that it is a rpg. So my recomendation is walk don't run to the video store and if you are really bored and love frustration, rent this game."
1,Please don't buy this game :(,"This game was made by the same people who brought you the dismal Ever Grace and features a thin plot, poor controls, graphics and playability on top of what was originally a good idea. An example of the poor coding in this game?--monsters can hit you with projectiles THROUGH WALLS (and you could hit them only if you knew where they were)! Talk about bad coding :(Zakarius"
1,This game,I personal thought this game (...) becuase only thing i could do was do alittle jab with my sword. I would get ankle deep in water a my guy would fall down and die in 1 secound flat. (...) So beware users dont waste your money unless you are disperate to buy this game no matter what no body can change my mind about this game (...)
2,Cheap Game,"This game was not very well thought out. Other than the talking characters, the game play feels really cheap. Feels more like a PS1 game than PS2. King's Field II is way, way better... so was the first one. I was expecting this game to be like King's Field since it was made by the same company. Other than the first person view/feel, attacking, and picking up items, it is nothing like it. The music is cheap, alot of the rooms look the same, there is no map, and the gameplay is too fast and rushed. I'm in a poison area where you have to keep activating your Protect Ring to keep yourself safe. I'm trying to fight monsters and whatnot. Having to constantly use this item and waste magic doing it instead of being able to use your other rings is a pain. The game was not very fun to play to begin with, so I don't know why they threw in that poison area. Don't get me wrong, the game isn't the worst I've played, but it's definitely not what I expected or even remotely close to it."
2,Nice little earner!,"This is the first review I have ever contributed to Amazon. While the basic points made in the book are valid and pertinent, creating a 'book' out of what amounts to two pages worth of saliency stretches the notion of value to the extreme. The anecdotes / examples fill space and add nothing to the narrative, in fact the anecdotes devalue the validity of the kernel. I would not have bought this book if I had seen it first. That said, the authors understanding and interpretation of female motivations is excellent.A little more proper analysis would have been helpful - and advice on moving forward with relationships."
2,So-so to poor,"the author is kind of a weird dude. He does have a few good ideas, but other parts are pretty far out there. I read it once and I'm actually flipping through it again right now thinking what guy goes online to meet a woman on the other side of the country and thinks there's a reasonable chance that it could work out... I know, a crazy guy!! LOL"
1,This book sucks,"I have never purchased such a bunch of crap in my life. This is the got to be the worst ""Man's guide"" I have ever read. This guy has got no game to speak of and his best advice is to not drive 60 miles out of your way and get husstled out of a bunch of money by some chick. Duh!!! [...]"
5,"The anti ""Rules Book""","I know Marc Rudov intended his book as a guide for men, but I was extremely surprised at the powerful insight he offers to women. The Man's No-Nonsense Guide to Women, the antithesis of that ""Rules"" book, is a must-read for every woman. Rudov uses intriguing, thought-provoking metaphors to upset the apple-cart of antiquated socialization that keeps men and women at odds. I highly recommend this book."
1,"If you want to know women, do not buy this book","Written by a complete moron, this man wouldn't be able to get a date if he were the last man on earth. Seriously this guy has momma-issues written all over the place, and he has the audacity to write a book for poor SAPS desperate for some romance. Well let me save you your money. THIS WILL NOT WORK. THIS MAN IS AN EGOMANIAC AND KNOWS NOTHING."
5,"Insightful, practical and useful.","I've read a number of books on women, dating and relationships and I found several insights in Marc Rudov's book. Unlike many other ""dating"" books Marc takes a practical, everyday look at dating and romance and he does it without the shameless self promotion which permeates other similar books.This book is certainly worth a careful read, everyone should be able to find one insightful element from this book."
1,Rip Off Recording,"... The cd is taken from an overseas lp master tape and is not mixed for cd. If you want the best sound quality, purchase the America version (MCA - 088 112 043-2)lovingly remastered by Stephen Barncard. The three bonus tracks aren't even by Crosby & Nash. Two are by Stephen Stills and one is by an unknown artist."

Two are by Stephen Stills and one is by an unknown artist."
3,Sweep Is Amazing (This one wasn't the best in the series),"I loved the sweep series, of the books this wasn't my favorite, however it is still a great book. You shoulder, however, start with novel 1 ""Book of Shadows""Great writing: the characters are well developed and in depth, even the side characters. The plot is a steady pace, not very fast paced, but steady and firm. The sentence structure is amazing, strong language, descriptive, and not overly complex, I hate novels that show off as many huge words as they can manage is the hopes of looking like a smart author. Tiernan is very talented; she can, while using statements and observations about other characters, tell the reader what the other characters are feeling, in first person without it being obviously, like stating something ""He seemed sad.""If you love paranormal, romance, love-triangles, high school drama, and suspense you will love Sweep."
5,Love the series,"This is a fun series to read. The author keeps everything fresh and new. Each book leaves you wanting to read the next one. I thoroughly enjoy reading these books. They are a short read but worth it especially when your sitting and waiting somewhere, this book is perfect."
4,Strife,"Strife was a very interesting but frustrating book. Morgan was accused of causing bad things to happen, and I couldn't believe that the people closest to her believed she could be behind this. Like the other novels in the Sweep series, it is a page turner. It seems the author is trying to shift the focus to a ""new"" character, and I am not sure if I even like this ""new"" character. I was also trying to figure out if either of the new characters introduced are actually trustworthy. A fantastic read, and I will continue to look forward to the forthcoming novel in the Sweep series"
4,Can Morgan take everything?,"Morgan finally believes that all of her troubles concerning Cal, Selene, and Ciaran are over, but she is wrong. Almost everywhere she goes something bad happens. These occurences are always happening to hurt her, or someone near. The council thinks it's Ciaran, but can it really be? Everyone thinks its her fault, after all she is a very powerful, yet unitiated, untrained witch. She knows that it's not her, but will anyone believe her?I really enjoy Cate Tiernan's books. But watch out for this one's ending!"
4,A little something for just about anyone.,Let's start by saying tastes in erotica vary. This collection has a little something for everyone. The stories are more consistently sensual than erotic per say. While some of the story lines did nothing for me there are a number of gems here that make the collection well worth the read.
2,Not as good as 2000,I received the 2000 edition from a friend and I thought it was a bit over the top. Then I decided to buy this one and I was very disappointed. It was boring.
4,Definitely good music for many places...,"Subtleties abound on this soft-spoken and depressing album. The vocals hum softly over extremely delicate instrumentation. The percussion is muted, adding to the effect. I caught the band opening for Album Leaf in Chicago and would certainly recommend their live performance as well. My only complaint with this album is that I personally would like to see a few more directions taken in the songs, but I realize that the concept is stark, and so it wouldn't necessarily fit well with the aforementioned instrumentation."
5,fascinating views of food and customs of the Middle Ages,"Professors Carlin and Rosenthal are to be commended for their wide-ranging exploration of a subject we too often take for granted - getting food to the table and eating it. From the fascinating ""Fast Food and Urban Living Standards in Medieval England"" to the the grisly ""Cannibalism as an Aspect of Famine in Two English Chronicles"", this is a scholarly look at how another culture approached meals and eating. I could not put this book down. I found myself needing to know ""Did the Peasants Really Starve in Medieval England?"" and enthralled by ""Driven by Drink? Ale Consumption and the Agrarian Economy of the London Region"". And I still want to know how ""From Michaelmas 1412 to Michaelmas 1413 Alice de Bryene served more than 16,500 meals at her Acton manor house"". There's a lot about cooking in this book, and a lot more about history and economics, but it's eventually about people."
4,Avoiding the Scanning Blues,I was very pleased with the condition and the promtness of receiving this book. I highly recommend this seller.
5,What an amazing concept,"Mr. Simmons has done it, an action hero in the 1930's who is an African American. The book captures everything a good action book should and is a nessesity in any good collection"
3,Beware,As much as I love these boots just note the first 20 times or so I wore them I had toget help to put them on. After awhile it gets easier and you can do it yourself but darn the journey to get that point.
4,Heroin Mon Amour,"The tale Shoenfelt tales is a familiar to anyone who's read THE STORY OF JUNK, JUNKY, CANDY, HOW TO STOP TIME, namely ""how I fell in and out of love with heroin."" Shoenfelt is very good on the details--you are right in every awful place he shoots up; unsparing and unsentimental about the attractions of heroin; the concactenation of pleasure and humiliation; difficult personal insights addiction can bring and the fact that doesn't redeem the misery you're making of your life and the lives of others. He also has a great sense of humor; the ability to laugh at himself and others; also sympathize with them."
4,My wife likes it.,"I got this for my wife, who is about 4 months along in her first pregnancy and needed some TLC. She likes it a lot. You have to sit in it for a while to really benefit from it, because the vibrators are not extremely strong. If you relax and read a book in it, you will really feel better after 15 minutes. You can plug it into the wall or into your car outlet.We have only had it for about 1 month so I can't speak to its durability over time."
2,BEWARE using this product,"My wife used this device, and fell asleep on it. She got seven 2nd degree burnsfrom using it. Be Careful using it, it should have a timer on the heatoption."
3,Watch out for the crotch vibrator...,I have a big ol booty so I didn't find this to be the best fit for my body type. Then to top it off the remote is in a rather uncomfortable spot. The heat is in the lower back. I don't use it. The vibration is strong and steady. It gets a little boring/numbing after about 10 minutes. One naughty benefit that surprised me was that this massager vibrates your crotch really well because of the location of the seat vibes. I chose to fold up the seat cushion for a stronger lower back vibration. That provides good lower back support too. So I don't exaclty use the massager as was intended but I made do. I have had better massagers but this one it not to bad.For the price it does the trick.
3,Heat is in low back only,"This heats the low back area only. It was disappointing for me, since I need something that will heat the leg area."
2,"Maybe good for a car seat cushion, otherwise weak lame massager","I was so looking forward to lying on this in my bed and getting 'kneaded', after my little lumbar massager burned out. Boy I was disappointed. Absolutely felt NOTHING! I heard the buzzing but there was almost zero pressure.I suppose if you are ultra sensitive or have painful pressure points and need minimal pressure, this might be okay, but for most people you are not going to feel this at all.I was just too lazy to send it back, and it now sits in my garage.I re-ordered the lumbar massager which gives real strong kneading plus heat."
4,Great Christmas Present,I have bought this for my boyfriend( he is 23) in december for xmas. He work a full-time job as a hotel operator so he sits from 6-8 hours at a time in a chair and he complains of lower back problems from sitting all the time. So I decided this will be a great gift. It turned out he loved it. All his co-workers asked him where he got it etc! i mean it only been almost a month but I was very satisfied! The price isnt too bad either. His favorite is the heated part. I tried it myself and I like it. It vibrates and heats up! Great for a person who works sitting down.
3,ok great for the price,"its great for the price and dose exactly what its supposed to do massage ... but by vibration not a kneading action. it could have used 6 motors instead of 5 though my problem spot is right between my mid and lower back, but the lower back only has one motor."
3,works fine; easy to operate,"i bought the seat massager primarily for our 20hr car ride to florida. i bought 2 of these for the front seats, but only used one on the way down. i will however use the second one for the ride home. it was very easy to set up and use. it did provide ample heat to my back which was very nice. the massaging portion was ok, not awesome, just ok. i did find that my leg didn't fall asleep while i was driving like in the past, so it did help. my husband even thought it was ok (which is a positive thing because he doesn't usually say too much!)"
4,soothing for mid level to low level pain,I bought this as I was recovering from a bout of sciadica. It does the job if you have low level pain and stiffness in your lower back. Also if you sit for extended periods. I use it in my car during commuting time. It just keeps things loose by warming and gently massaging. Its no miracle cure but is a nice tool toward recovery. It also feels good after a workout.
4,Cushion Massager,"My wife uses this in the passenger seat on long trips in the car to ease back discomfort.It works well for what it is designed to do. The only drawback on this and other similarproducts is that the massager must be turned off every 15 - 20 minutes to avoid themotor burning out. This somewhat defeats the purpose on a long ride, but is still satisfactoryoverall."
3,weak motor,"The heating element is strong. youl'll feel the heat pretty fast. As for the motor massager, its more like viberator."
3,Product shipped quickly-Exactly as pictured,This product is adequate for those needing something for long drives or the occasional backache. There really is no massaging action it's just vibration but the heating element in this back massager works very well.
2,massager,Vibration is quite effective.. its quite thick and tend to stick to your back when seated although there is a hook on .it is a discomfort to me..
1,poor availability of blades,"The dewalt saw is a capable compound miter. The problem is the 8 !/2 inch blade, which is a odd size and does'nt have any fine tooth available at all. The only blade that I could locate is a fast woodcutting, which is unnacceptable in some instances. There are many different blades available in 8 1/4, why they made this saw 8 1/2 is beyond me. Why make a saw with no blades available."
5,little saw with a big saw heart,"I've just had the saw a couple of weeks, but I did a small trim job with it and it worked great. It does everything a 10 or 12 inch saw would need to do on a nice trim job with about half the weight. I owened a 12 inch dewalt slide compound a few years back that someone stole from me, it was a great saw but it was so heavy to move from job to job. the 8.5 slide is the perfect trim saw for me and I love it and I'm glad I bought it. I give it 5 stars and I'm left handed."
4,"Accurate, but not accurate","It's accurate for sliding miter saw, but not dead on. I also don't understand why it does not have symmetrical fence on both sides. The blades are expensive for the size. If you do flooring work, this is your best friend."
2,Terrible design,"I thought I would love this saw just like my 12"" slide Dewalt, but the design is terrible. The shroud around the dust port hits the workpiece as does the cast aluminum around the slide. It is impossible to cut anything higher than 3.5 inches at a 45 degree angle. I cant believe this saw made it to production. If this wasn't paid for by insurance to replace a stolen sawbuck that is out of production, I would return it. It is now relegated to a blade turned backwards to cut vinyl siding. Worthless!"
3,Pretty good.,The machine itself is excellent but they put a cheap saw blade on it. I immediately replace with a Forrest CM08H606100 which leaves a smooth as glass cut behind.
3,Too damn expensive,"I bought one at Harbor Freight, made in China like this one, it has worked great for 2 years for 130 dollars. This is also made in China, probably the same place as the Hbr Frt one. Your nuts to buy this crap, your only making some corporation ritch."
3,A little disappointed,"The saw delivered completely setup (no assembly required). Disappointed the saw off approx. 3/16 inch (straight cut) instruction book was good explaining how to correct. The wrench supplied with saw very poor quality,end rounded off. The blade supplied good for framing application. Portability and weight OK. I will work with what I have, if had to do again, I would purchase 10 inch slider, has best selection and availability of replacement blades."
4,Nice saw,"I picked up the Dewalt 712 to replace my 10"" makita. Cuts smooth and was cutting square out of the box. The one thing I found was when you finish the cut, you have to make sure the saw head has been pushed all the way back or else it leaves a small amout of material uncut. They need to push the fence forward a 16th of an inch. Also for $400.00 they should include a dust bag! Overall a good quality saw."
4,Dark Fae = Good Book,"This is not your kids type of faerie book. This book's mythology is based on the old myths of the Fae. They are not nice creatures, but dark, very dark.I think the dialogue was interesting and smart. I said before that I liked some of the quotes, and one in particular still sticks with me:""Duncan sighed, 'Our Dreams become smaller and more desperate as we get older. I think. The world strips more from us, until we'd trade anything just to get back what we once had.'""That quote is something I think most adults can relate too, with opportunities coming and going, doors opening and shutting. Sometimes we wish we could go back in time to when all the opportunities were open to us.I liked it, and I wish we'd see more books steeped in the older, dark, Irish-style faerie tales."
3,Original and fast-moving,"But I think I would have enjoyed it more had I been a teenage girl. While free from errors and with characters not totally flat, it did still read like a book intended for ""young adults."" And while only a tiny element of the book, when other reviewers say ""romance,"" what they really mean is ""bodice-ripper."" Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book as a light read. I'm just not sure that I will continue on to her other novels."
3,Not As Described,"The item description states the set comes with two standard pillow cases. Well, it only comes with one!"
5,Creative ideas made me money...,"I'm glad I read Garage Sale Magic before my latest garage sale. As a result of some of the ideas in the book, I had my largest garage sale by far, even though I did it in only 2 days. The idea about adding merchandise to the sale was very worthwhile. I also went into this sale with a better attitude, and had much more fun during the sale. I've read other books on garage and yard sales, but this one packed the most info in the most readable format. I plan on buying their video with some of the money I made."
4,Well worth the money!,"I read ""Garage Sale Magic"" less than a month ago, and just completed my first garage sale in almost ten years. The last time, I didn't do well and was frustrated. This time, I made well over a thousand dollars, and plan on having a sale each year. The book pointed out many important things to remember - it served as a good checklist for me before the sale. Very easy to read and put me in the right mood before the sale. I recommend it!"
3,sort of useful,"I found this booklet - because it's way too skinny to be a real book - to be somewhat useful at best. It gives you a few good tips, but tells you lots of stuff most people already know when preparing for a garage sale. (i.e. make sure you have change - no kidding! And I thought their suggestion for how much change to have was too little to boot!)If you can find this book very very cheaply, it might be worth it. If not, cruise the internet for some of the more useful garage sale websites."
5,The best mob story I ever read.........,"This is the best mob strory i ever read, it took a great deal of courage for George Fresolone to do what he did, i hope some day to see this story on the big screen.............."
5,What is really going on in the mob?,"What if you are a boy growing up with your dad doing illegal gambling, and working with the mob. well in the book Blood Oath by George Fresolone. George goes through the book and explains to you how his life in the mob started out and how he became one of the mob families gambling buddy. He explains to you who he worked for and what he did for his boss. George gives us great detail in how the mob was formed and how it was ran. My opinion I believe you should definately buy Blood Oath, because it's a book you could read moer than once. You can certainly expect alot of info about what they did, and why they did it. Also he explains to you how he actually came around in helping the law. The author likes to give his info in large paragraphs to give more detail to everything."
1,a box of false advertising,"This toy is SO overpriced for what you recieve. It shows what seems to be real toy airplanes on the box but when you open it, inside you get 4 paper airplanes to put on balsa and one rubber slingshot plane and a few airplane flash cards. Obviously children will be disappointed upon opening it (not to mention the parents.) The balsa plane crashed quickly. Buyer beware. (One more thing- Wilbur Wright's name is spelled ""Wilber"" underneath his photo on the flashcard.)"
1,Completely misleading and disappointing,"The people responsible for packaging this product deserve an award. They make this product seem like it's going to be totally cool for kids to make and fly their own planes. DON'T BE FOOLED!! The planes use incredibly flimsy balsa wood and they don't fly at all. Basically our son colored some wings and planes and then watched them drop to the ground like rocks when he tried to fly them. Your child will be extremely disappointed, as mine was. The only redeeming quality to this product is the little bit educational info they provide (what is lift, etc.) But it's not like you can't find that info someplace else. This is a big waste of money. You're better off buying a really good paper airplane book and making your own."
1,You WILL feel cheated.,"The other reviews are correct. You WILL feel cheated. The box is very well done. Even if you meticulously read the box,(it does describe one balsa fuselage and balsa wing with other cardboard wings) the size and box art will convince you that there is a durable, old fashioned model airplne kit inside. When you open the relitively large box your heart will sink to see a single thin metallic envelope inside, and about 90% empty space. It is upsetting to realize that someone purposely designed that box to mislead..."
1,disappointed,"I got my package on time but,when I opened it one of the bags was busted so I lost some of the clear jel due to the way it was package.Other wise I liked the clear jel it did a great job and easy to use."
4,Got my ClearJel TWO days after ordering it!!,"I ordered this two days ago when I saw a limited time sale on peaches at my grocery store. Today was the last day of the peach sale and so I bought some really firm ones, thinking that it would take at least another week to get my ClearJel in. When I got home though, there it was waiting for me! The packaging was just fine for me, I think they must have changed the way they package because mine came in a box.Thanks Kitchen Krafts!"
5,A lot for a little,It worked great in the vegan lemon meringue pie I used it for. I wish it was sold in a smaller quantity.
5,Arrivd as Ordered,I purchased two bags of ClearJel and they arrived well packaged and undamaged. I have yet to begin cooking with it...that comes this weekend with an abundance of peaches we have.
2,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"I purchased this book as a replacement to our Calvert School book needed for homeschooling. I went on the picture that was displayed and instead I received a very old covered book that was not from the Calvert School collection. I have not started using it to see if it indeed contains the same written material, but I think this seller needs to be more forthcoming with their books. They knew it would sell better with this cover and that is unfair as I am not in a position to return it at the moment."
5,Sign,"We were decorating a room with a New Orleans theme. My husband's son had a sign like that in his room years ago, so we searched for one on the internet and it was just what we were looking for!"
3,Dracula revisited.,"This novel takes place in a parallel world where women rule and men are essentially non-existent -- but for one, a pseudo-Dracula keeping a dungeon full of captives for sexual training and ultimately impregnation. (In this world, women have to ""learn"" to get pregnant, apparently, and they are ""taught"" by being raped repeatedly.) Lots of lesbian sex, naturally, most of it involving sadism, bondage, corporal punishment, humiliation, etc. If you understand and buy into the plot, this is an OK read. (You should read the author's earlier book, a prequel to this one.) Otherwise, pass it by."
2,2 stars at best,"nice little cd, but honestly not worth the buy unless you can get it for less than a dollar. the songs are monotonous and unimaginative with a real lack in original ideas.hope I help someone not waste their money."
3,An Introduction to Chaos,"The book is deception by the author! He says he is letting you in on chaos, but doesn't. He tries but is not talking in the language that he actually thinks should be used to talk about these systems. He is only decieving himself and not the reader! I wish he had written this as if he were trying to explain it to his children and not as a way to make money. Your unique Associates ID is: thefractaltransl."
2,huh oh,Make sure your wife likes this kind of stuff other wise you look like a jackass and it makes you hate valantines day!
5,This is what IMAX is all about,"You can go watch a movie like The Hunger Games in IMAX 3D but it is not going to be even close to watch this kind of documentary on that amazingly huge screen, and the conversion to Blu-ray is just as fantastic. Of course is not as immersive as being in the theater because of the screen size but is a fantastic story and the picture and sound quality is the best you can get on any Blu-ray up to date because of the film being shot with IMAX cameras.Thanks amazon.com for getting this Blu-ray a day before release day!"
1,Not worth it!!,"We just got a 3-D TV and player for Christmas. Looking for a great 3-D movie to watch so I ordered this one. It's a boring documentary about saving a monkey and a elephant. I was hoping to see a lot of Africa animals, not so. I've already gave it away!"
3,Decent movie but 3D needs to be on IMAX screen,"Movie is good, and the effects are decent but they were generated with the idea you would view them on an IMAX screen. There I am sure they are amazing!! However, I would encourage home screens to avoid IMAX movies for this reason. I was far more impressed with movies that know they will be living on smaller screens so they zoom up on objects and the 3D feels more inclusive. Just my take."
5,A cute movie with a Very Important Message,"I'm a self-professed orangutan lover. My computer screensaver? Picture of a baby orangutan. My phone's background? Orangutan. I have orangutan stuffed animals, and anytime I'm in a city that has a zoo with orangutans, I make a point to stop by. Born To Be Wild is a short film stuffed to the brim with ADORABLE baby orangutans (oh and I should mention, ADORABLE baby elephants too). Honestly, what more could you want? Nothing. Except Born To Be Wild didn't only meet my expectations, it exceeded them! It also included a wonderful treatise on the importance of protecting our world's species, especially in this time of deforestation, poaching, and climatic change. Fortunately, it never becomes preachy, probably because whenever it risks entering proselytizing territory, a baby orangutan swings into the scene.Seriously, watch it. BABY ORANGUTANS...and elephants."
5,Great stories,Our child (and we) learned so much watching this. She now wants to go to Kenya and work with animals. This is a much better way to spend a family movie night than with some animated feature.
5,Excellent movie!,What's not to like about a movie that Morgan Freeman narrates? I went to the theater and saw this movie twice. Now I own it and I am very pleased with the 3D quality. It's a really touching story about two women who are helping to save animals. It's refreshing to know they're out there. Get the kleenex out though!
5,Amazing 3d Movie,There were many WOW!! moments. There is a scene where the baby elephants play and dust themselves with the red sand. We could see the dust coming out of the TV screen for couple of feet.One of my best 3d collections.
2,Unimpressed with 3D overall...,"The narration by Morgan Freeman was nice and the critters were cute. Otherwise, the movie offered little more impact than it's 2D version. There are no 3D effects or other characteristics that would motivate me to watch this in 3D vs 2D."
4,not enthralling but very good,"For anyone who loves animals, this movie would be a great way to try out the 3 d glasses. It's sweet but a little slow, and didn't hold everyone's attention for the whole movie."
2,Where are the 3D effects?,"This is an OK film, but you could see similar and better ones on Animal planet for free. People buy 3D version for the effects, which there were virtually none. Yes, there appears to be more volume to the picture, but if you expect anything to be ""coming out of the TV"", look elsewhere! The narration was quite boring and monotonous. Definitely is not worth the price!"
2,BORN TO BE WILD,I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE MORE ANIMALS IN THE WILD AND THEIR HABITAT.ONLY MONKEYS AND ELEPHANTS IN THIS ONE.BORN TO BE WILD.
2,3D or not 3D !,"This blue-ray 3D actually contains some of outstanding 3D images , there is a few scene that attract viewer to pay attention but overall this is boring documentary cause of the film script have no glue of what it want to show or to tell ."
2,Not great.,"Compared to other 3D DVDs I've watched, this one was far below standards. Overall an ok video, but would have been just as good in 2D."
4,about monkeys and elephants,"It was done nicely,but I didnt realize it was only about monkeys and elephants. It was very interesting and my two grandchildren liked it."
2,just okay,Can't figure out how to get software setup to get the entire package with the label printer and scanner gun together working. Bought the deluxe wasp nest package thinking it would be sufficient only to realize I needed the label maker also. HMMMMM. Turned out to be quite the costly investment.
2,AVP review part 5 unfortunately part 4 is on the triple packs standard edition reviews 3/10,"Yeah I was serious on part 4 that Robocop 3 Terminator 3 Street Fighter 94 & MK had better characters & it was more interesting. Back when Sigourney Weaver filmed Alien 3 she wanted to kill her character to liberate the series quote ""I heard they wanted to Alien vs Predator which just sounded awful"" Mrs. Weaver would be right but they tried to attach a great set of movies to this crap setting it in 2004 before the Alien quadrilogy the only reason I give 3/10 & that's being very generous after 3 viewings because of the action scenes they rocked & Lance Henriksen. Paul WS Anderson the only fim I liked that you directed was MK & that was 14 years ago so s**t Paul you can't direct for s**t. Just watch the 4 stand alone Alien movies with Sigourney Weaver & the 2 Predator movies."
5,A really good batch of movies !,"Predator triple feature is really an awesome set of movies. I was really young when I saw Predator for the first time and I did not remember what happened in the jungle. So, I particularly enjoyed it. Furthermore, several languages are available which is also a good point for foreigners like me. I give 5 stars to this product even if I think they would deserve 4.5, mainly because of the impressive number of incoherences in the AVP screenplay (in particular, compared to what is known about Aliens from the Alien Legacy). My marks are: 5/5 for Predator, 5/5 for Predator 2, and 3.5/5 for AVP. Also note that 2 versions of AVP are available in this package, the ""theater version"" (~100 min.) and the ""long version"" (~ 102 min.) which is shorter than the unrated version (~ 108 min. and not available in this package)."
3,People like it,Sorry they are not my kind of movies. It was bought as a Christmas gift to a really big fan.
5,Perfect name for a book,What a fact filled book! Perfect for the novice to read and re-read. Hope that Mr. Sagazio finds the time to write a part two with all the new products that have come out since he wrote this one.
2,Poor Safe-Cycling Tips,"I flipped through this book, but read their advice on traffic cycling with care. It's just plain shoddy, and could get someone killed. For example, theygive an absurdly complicated scheme for making left turns on multiple lane roads. I could hardly make heads or tails of it, and I've been commuting, racing, and riding recreationally for 15 years! The best I could figure, they have left turning cyclists turning across the path of straight through motorists, which is both illegal and dangerous, instead of properly merging over to the left turn lane."
4,???,"Uh, I checked the label and there is nothing that can be considered a chemical. My only issue is that it doesn't detangle my long hair too well, but it's a great scalp treatment."
4,This is GREAT for good-looking laminating!,"I haven't found any other product like this. If you need to laminate things and want them to look nice, this really pops with that clean black border. You end up with an attractive document, and not a thin flimsy one either. The only way this could be better is if they figured out how to do it without heat."
5,"Truly a great anime, especialy for history buffs","A few things that I like about this anime:The characters are very real, and some of the moral delemas they have are interesting. There is a sense of great confussion and a bit of anxiety among the crew also which fits well with the events of the story.The military weapons and systems they use in the series are accuratly portrayed also. This series shows how powerfull a modern day destroyer truly is.I would recommend this series strongly to anyone interested in ww2 history . Even if your not into history it's a great story that most will enjoy."
3,"Decent product, slow service","For some reason this book took a long time to come in - about 3 to 4 weeks. Otherwise, it was in great condition.The book itself has great pictorial representations for easy understanding, but it wasn't as in depth as I'd hoped it would be. If you're a female like me who doesn't know anything about cars, it's very helpful. If you know what you're doing a bit more, you might want to try for something a bit more advanced."
5,Truly Awesome,"This is an essential book for auto repairs. It helps get some of the basics down so you can repair your own car savings a lot of money! I recommend this book for anyone starting out doing your own repairs like oil changes, and the like."
2,Size Dissapointment,"When I received this shirt, it seemed really nice- color, look, feel, etc. It was advertised as a woman's shirt, so I ordered size XL. I was dissapointed when I opened the package at it was so small in size. Maybe it was a junior's or even a misses XL, but certainly not a women's XL.There is a link to a manufacturer's sizing chart, but I found no information there."
2,Ebook,"Guys, Please be aware while buying this ebook that you cannot print more then 21 pages. I bought the hard copy and upgraded to ebook. I have a habit of reading from pages instead of reading online, I upgraded it to ebook jy=ust because I had to read it urgently and I was so frustrated when i came to know i cant print the book more then 21 pages.So make sure what you want before you upograde it to ebooks. I think amazon should mention before selling ebooks that how many pages can one print. I think amazon just try to misguide by not mentiponing the number of pages that can be printed before selling the ebook."
4,Great Game,"Armored Core 2 is a fine addition to my PS2 Library. It offers good graphics and sound, and extremely fun gameplay.You will not be able to just pick up a controller and start playing. It takes a little bit of time to get used to the controls. Once you do, you are in a for a fun, Mech experience.The thing I enjoyed most about this game is that I can choose either missions to complete, or 1 on 1 mech battles to earn money to upgrade my mech. The 1 on 1 battles can be pretty tough. You will die a lot until you learn how to control your mech quite well. Once you do, you will still find some of your Mech opponents to be quite challenging.Overall, this game is a winner, and offers a unique, yet fun style of gameplay that can not be found in any other PS2 game. Mech fans will surely love this. All others should give this one a try as well.Recommended!!"
5,Tite game!!,This game it a mager hit!! If you play this game do mitions untill you get to a destroy reserch team then go to arena and kill every one!! The higher you go the more money you get for winning!! trust me it is a live saver!!
5,Awesome!,"Very, VERY complex. Tons of parts to build with. Great controls, and awesome, detailed visuals and explosions!"
5,Armored Core 2,The game looks neat and has awesome grafics with hundreds of different mechs. It is one of my top picks and I recomended for a must buy!
2,Wana waste some $ cash ????,"This game is horrible! If you enjoy wasting your money than this is the game for you. The graphics are the only thing that makes the game seem exiting. The missions enventually get extremely boring...I personly recomend a game such as Final FantasyX or Capcom VS. SNK2. But.. if you fancy a waste of time and ...{money}, than ....HAVE FUN WITH ONE OF THE WORST GAMES OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!"
2,Not Good Enough For Your PS2!,"Armored core is a fun game, but I don’t think it’s a good game. I believe this was the first game I really really enjoyed on the PS2. Unfortunately, I didn’t think it was worth the hype and the expense of getting the machine. Honestly, I felt as if I could have played it on my N64 and saved [price]. It was disappointing because there was so much potential with the combination of the platform and the genre. Yet, it was the same as always. I enjoyed the game, but I think if you want a fun game that shows you the power of the machine spend your money on Twisted Metal: Black or wait for Metal Gear. I think Armored core is no better than what a lesser machine can run. As a result, spend your money elsewhere and find something that makes your PS2 sing."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"I would of gave this game a zero star but the lowest is one. The game play is messed up, sounds mess up in the game, get close to the wall and u see through it, ang analog on controller. You are slow amd its hard to dodge shots. I can't believe i wasted my money on a game like this. Wait intill September and get the third one. Hopfully there is no bugs."
2,Not a good book to jam with your band,"This book is only good for those people who wants to play the whole tune with the piano. If you have a vocalist, a guitarist, a bassist and you want to accompany on piano then this book is not recommended. It doesn't provide you much on the background piano as what you have heard from the album. Not even 20% of it. But you can use this book as a guideline to find the exact background piano played on the album."
2,Quick Book Made From An Episode,"This book is disappointing.As a previous reviewer said, the book feels like it is missing words and parts of the story. It is not a pleasure to read.For instance, Dora needs to get eggs out of the pond. The reader is asked to help pick which item will help from her backpack.Then on the next page the eggs are out. Or the reader is asked to help wake the sleepy sloth to get an egg on her belly.On the next page Dora suddenly has the egg but we never see the sloth wake. These sound silly as I'm writing them but they are important parts of the story to a kid!When I saw the episode that this book was based on, it all made sense. They just wanted to make a quick buck with a book and unfortunately, by trying to create an age-appropriate length, they cut out tons of stuff.There are definitely better Dora books out there."
1,Worse TV ever made,"We are now getting a Sony after 2 of these Toshiba's blew up. The first one made loud popping noises, and then after being only 2 days old the whole picture became distorted. We got a replacement, that after a week, it started making popping noises and the convergence has to be realigned. Now it can no longer be aligned in the corners. Do not trust this model!"
3,Adequate & Annoying,"The authors' explanation of the workings of the Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc systems is adequate but is not particularly well written and often lacks clarity. This is certainly not one of NOLO's best offerings.Especially annoying was the authors' frequent and tedious editorializing. I suspect most readers of this book want the facts, not the authors' socialistic, simplistic opinions."
4,"Reasonable drill, needs a little more power","I ordered the 1-9/16"" Dewalt hammer drill to drill holes in granit. I was drilling 1-1/4"" holes. I know granit is harder than concrete but I was drilling 1-1/4"" holes instead of the 1-9/16"" that it is rated for.The first one I recieved- the plastic collar where the depth bar mounts was broken. That is a weak design. That collar should not be plastic. I had to return the whole drill and get a new one. The new one was intact.I have drilled about nine 1-1/4"" holes 36"" deep with it now. It works well for the price but it is a little underpowered. I would rate it 1-1/8"" instead of 1-9/16"" it is currently rated at. If my 1-1/4"" bit would get stuck it wouldn't even have the power to unstick it. I have three 1/2"" chuck drills, two of them have more torque than this hammer drill.If you have 1-1/8 holes or smaller I would definately recomend this drill. It's a nice hammer drill for the price. If your holes are larger I would recomend going up to a bigger size."
4,A broad sweep of astrology and its mythological foundations,"While this unusual book seems to drift all over the sky, it is basically coherent and definitely well-written. If you're looking for a book to better understand the underpinnings of astrology, then this book offers insights not found elsewhere. Each zodiac sign is examined in the context of myths from several cultures. The last third of the book is a collection of articles that deal with myth-making, the cycle of year, personal myths in the horoscope, etc. This book is appropriate for newcomers to astrology who will appreciate all the connections drawn between signs and planets and the things of everyday life - like language and calendars."
2,Catfish mailbox,I was so excited to get this fish. It was a Christmas gift. It arrived on time and I peaked in the box before wrapping it and giving it to my Daughter and Son in Law. She was very excited about the fish until we took it out of the box. The bottom of the tail had all the paint rubbed off. I was upset and told her I would return it. She refused because she loved the mailbox so much. I wish I would have removed it from the box instead of peaking before I wrapped it.
5,Fun summer nights!,I bought this fireplace as a gift for my parents. They have really enjoyed it and have used it almost every night. Setup was a breeze - no problems at all. The shape of this fireplace is great for building a fire - the logs fit in easily. It's also bigger than I expected. I would highly recommend this outdoor fireplace. You'll have plenty of fun enjoying a fire once the sun goes down.
5,This is the one!,"Guys, this is a great purchase. It's a quality unit and is bigger than it looks on the package. Charbroil has done a fabulous job of making such a good little unit for such a good price. Unless you're looking for something totally snazzy and are willing to spend a lot of money, don't pass this one up!"
1,MST3K Material! Definitely!,"I plan to put this film on my worst films ever made list. I mean it was absolutely terrible. It [is bad]! It's only redeemable quality is that you could back and crack on how stupid this film is with friends while you are less than sober. There is a [pjysical gratification] scene that is perhaps novel for 1980, yet of course it's not worth getting this film over, I had more fun watching Hobgoblins that was made around the same time."

4,An Near Perfect Bizarre Thriller.,"A Young Man in his Mid-Twenty by the name of Eric Binford (Dennis Christopher), which his First Love is Movies and he also Absorbing Them. When Eric falls in Love with a Marylin Monroe look-alike (Linda Kerridge). But Eric has Problems with People, who are Giving Him a Hard Time, soon, He goes over the Edge.Written and Directed by Vernon Zimmerman made a Suspenseful Thriller, which Movie Buffs and Horror Fans will love this. Because of the film`s Interesting Promise. It`s a Thriller with Some Horror Elements. Dennis Christopher gives a Tour de Force Performance in this flawed but Genuine Film. Mickey Rourke has a Small Role in this. Peter Horton has a very Small Part in this. This is a Excellent Film. Grade:B+."
5,In the Arms of God,"The merchant was very kind to send a second book when the first one arrived damaged. I would recommend that better packing materials are used in the future - I think the book(s) would fare better if they were sent in a bubble envelope.The book itself (In the Arms of God) is amazing and I would recommend it as a gift to anyone who is grieving or going through a terrible time. I wish the publisher would make more available, as right now they are hard to get."
1,Eeeew.,"I bought this sauce tonight because I felt like some linguine alfredo and it was on sale.I opened the jar and got a whiff of something completely artificial. I can't even properly describe it... it was like plastic. I thought, huh, maybe it just needs some garlic (I could smell no garlic whatsoever despite the self-described ""roasted garlic"" label). I mixed in half a tsp. of minced garlic. Nope... still smelled like melted plastic.I heated it up. It smelled worse. I tasted it. It tasted worse than it smelled.Bottom line is this... if you like alfredo, don't buy this. You'll only end up throwing out your dinner and most of a jar of sauce like I did."
4,Heely Replacement Wheels,"I was very happy with the Heely wheels I ordered for my daughter. They were easy to find and were the exact size for her shoes. THe only thing that would have made them any better is if they would of been a little cheaper. They were 1/2 the price of her shoes themselves, but without the replacement she was not able to wear them to roll around in."
5,highly recommended,"This is a really great book both for learning the basics and as a quick reference guide. I love that it's arranged alphabetically. Although it's divided into 2 parts (tools and techniques) it's still easier to look up topics without having to search through the index. The full color illustrations are clear and the numbered instructions are simple and easy to understand, very similar to ""Top 100 Simplified Tips & Tricks"". Anyone who liked that book will love this one as well."
2,Metaphysical Maundering,"It's not that parts aren't interesting, but Wilder's metaphysical maunderings (which pop up with disheartening regularity and which he would have probably termed ""philosophizing"") are (1)frequently incomprehensible, (2)often foolish in their overgeneralized assertiveness, and (3)sometimes exasperatingly contradictory, as if he himself were befuddled about what he's going on and on about. Maybe the last half of the book contains the parts that so many readers are adulating the whole of it for, but I sent the novel to the trash can about midway through. Too self-indulgent for my tastes, and I'm at a loss to account for the number of commentators who found the book such a meaningful delight."
4,"Correction to your ""Editorial Review""","In your editorial review you wrote that Douglas, Arizona is a border town in the Rio Grande. Although it is, in fact, a border town, that portion of the border is not where the Rio Grande is, as a quick ""Google Maps"" look will show."
3,Worth reading,"I read this book because it won the National Book Award for 1968. For much of the time I was reading I thought it inartfully written, the story line awfully contrived, and often boring. But there is a certain power to the story, and it depicts good people--John Ashley, above all--who should be admired. I guess I am glad I read this book, but I can't say I think it is felicitously written. I concluded the award of the National Book Award to this book was more to honor an old and famous writer than because the book is a great book."
5,A great travel guide to the Great State of Texas!,"If you live in Texas (and why wouldn't you?) or if you are planning a long trip to the Great State of Texas, you should buy this book and use it to plan out some weekend jaunts. The book is composed of 52 weekend recommendations, or trips. Each weekend recommendation is centered around a particular area and includes many activities, from leisurely walks and shopping, to adventureous ones. I have found the recommendations to be right on the money. This book is also a great read and provides substantial background information about each of the areas that serve as the center of each weekend ""trip"". Using this book as your main guide will help you experience all the great things that Texas has to offer."
2,Not what I wanted,It really doesn't help much but only tells you summaries of places. I was thinking it would be more of a travel planner. No pictures either.
1,Judging By Its Cover...,"I haven't read the book because I didn't get past the cover - because prominently displayed in the upper left corner is a saguaro cactus. That cactus is found in the Sonoran desert (Arizona, for example!), not in Texas (which has the Chihuahuan desert). Granted, the saguaro is a cliched image of Texas, reinforced by numerous John Wayne movie sets. It is not, however, a true part of Texas. A nice prickly pear would have been a better choice of cacti. Makes me suspect of the rest of the book. Surely someone at the publishing house should have checked this."
5,Great Lens for the Price!!,"If you are looking for a fun lens, for wide-angle shots, you could not do better. This lens comes with a longer warranty than the competitive brands, a lens hood (which some brands do not), and presents no compatibility problems with either my Minolta 5000i or Maximum 5. The range is very functional, with standard wide angle working well at 28mm, and the availability of some very interesting "" special effects"", if desired, with close-ups at the wider 19mm range. If you do not wish to spend for the ""name brand"", this your lens."
5,Its wax,Works as it should. The size makes it easy to hold and work with.Bright colors make it easy to find amongst my archery supplies.
4,Dewalt 18V Trim Saw,I have owned this saw for several years and aside from the battery draining down pretty quickly when cutting anything heavier than 1/4 to 3/8 inch it works fine as does most DeWalt tools.
2,handy and nothing else!!,"power of this saw is very week,it is very importent!If u dont have secend battery,dont be disapointet if u stop in the midle of your job.It really called ""TRIM SAW"" for a smal peace of wood! If you tryaing use TRIM SAW to cat wood 2x2, or 2x4 or plywood for longer time ,battery will dead very soon."
3,Tamron 28-300 on Sony Alpha 230,"I did quite a bit of research before buying this lens and discovered nothing but great reviews. Unfortunately for me, I never could quite capture the crispy clear images that I thought I would. I find my Sony kit lenses work far better than the Tamron lens. I'm going to give the lens another try to see if this one is faulty. I do love the wide range from macro to zoom, but my photos just aren't as clear as I'd like. I'm an amateur photographer and the lens just doesn't wow me like the Sony kit lenses."
4,Tamron 28-300 mm/3.5-6.3 XR LDZoom Lens,"I ordered this lens through Amazon, it came on time and in good order. I tried it with my Sony Alpha 100 camera right away. As an amateur photographer, the photo quality came out quite good for the price that I paid for the lens. I love it and I have not removed it from my camera. For a traveler like me, it's great since I don't have to carry too many lenses along: just this Tamron 28-300 mm lens alone is good enough for me and I am quite happy with it.Great lens for the price that I paid!Phan Dam"
2,Bed Hopper,I still have not installed this item due to poor instructions that accompany the item. If you have a tailgate rail protector the fit seems off. I need someone with experience to determine if it will work before I drill holes in my truck.
2,Get Pimp Chronicles Instead,"The same routine as his HBO special Pimp Chronicles. Pimp Chronicles has better sound, light, and production. The jokes in this video was the first time. The HBO special is the EXACT same jokes but polish and delivered better."
2,Don't waste your money.,I was very unimpressed with this dvd. Kat was not funny at all. He is funnier in movies.
3,Disappointed,"I was a disappointed with this DVD. It was the same routine as the HBO special, and the jokes just wasn't that funny the second time around."
5,UNIQUE COMEDY SPECIAL,I've never seen a comedy open with a mini documentary. It was powerful! A must see special!
3,OK,"I already had Pimp Chronicles and this was practically the same stuff. It was funny the first time, but boring this time."
2,A waste of money,"If you ownThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1then you should avoid this. This had about 98% the exact same material performed in front of a different audience and in full screen. So I found it to be a waste of money. It's one thing for comedians to repeat a joke or two as a filler an to repeat the same material for new audience, but to release it twice? What a way to screw us out our money! So if you ownThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1, then this would be a waste of money, if you ask me. Either release, the comedy is hilarious and worthy of 5 stars but this specific DVD only gets 2 because it's the same. It's a waste of money if you haveThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1. But if don't have either, go with this one, as there are a couple extra and extended jokes."
5,I can relate to the jokes......thats a +++++,"I have both the live and pimp chronicles, which he tells some of the same jokes. however he tells alot that are different and its worth getting both of them. Everyone whom i invited over took turns roling around on my carpet. i loved especially the joke he told about the crazy baby mamma, and how not to let the kids stress you out. on that note we all reminised on our own childhoods which made it all personal. It was definitely different from other comedic approaches and I love this dvd."
3,Not as good as his 1st DVD,"I love Katt Williams, but I was a little dissapointed that 75% of this material is the same as in his other DVD. And I don't care for the amature camera shooting as well. I had to give it 3 stars because of KATT, but if u own the other DVD, pass on this one."
1,GARBAGE,"It looks like this film was shot in someone's basement. Katt didn't sale his jokes. But his uses some of these joke in the ""Pimp Chronicles"" and he really sales them. Wouldn't recommend this dvd."
1,E.Diddy,"I expected it to be funnier..but he concentrates more on sex jokes than jokes on life, growing up and being black in America...waste of money..."
2,Stop The Torture {2 Stars},"This is another Katt Williams DVD that I had the misfortune of sitting through. Call me a hater if you want(which I'm sure you will), but dude is NOT funny. His HBO special was worse than Mike Epps (who I happen to think is hilarious) and now all we need is for Chris Tucker (also hilarious) to lay an egg on HBO so the Friday Sidekick Circle can be complete. Not only is he corny, but Williams has been bleeding this ""pimp"" routine ever since his role on Friday After Next and it's getting -- no, scratch that -- it got old about 3 years ago. While his role in Friday After Next was somewhat funny, this DVD is totally unfunny. He may tell a joke here or there that might make you chuckle, but nothing here will make you laugh.I have to ask though, was he doing these jokes BEFORE he did Friday After Next? Seriously, whether he was or wasn't, it's time for him to move on already, or at the very least, update his material. Avoid this DVD if you can."
4,Katt Williams LIVE,Just funny. Nothing else to say. Katt Williams is a hilarious man and I will buy everything that he is in just to get a real good laugh...
4,Hysterically Funny,Katt's take on fatherhood and growing up in general. Must see at least once. I've seen in on cable tv many times and found it on dvd (amazon.com). Want every one to see it.
3,This Guy Is Funny and Always Makes Me Laugh!,"I really like Katt. He is just funny, you have to laugh. He can talk about any color, anyone, anything, and it is funny. I laugh at him just jumping around on stage like he does... especially when he gets laughing at himself, and he does! This particular DVD was good, but not quite as good as The Pimp Ones. I liked this and glad I got it for some of the material is different, but I LOVE the Pimp ones - I ordered those too.If you want to laugh, and can laugh at everyone and everything, this is the guy!"
4,Hilarious,I ordered these because my husband loves Kat Williams. We laughed ourselves to tears. I definitely recommend this product.
5,Best/most helpful book to have on hand - covers everything!,"I have a very old copy of this book, and have used it till it has fallen apart. Dr. Vine covers everything in this book from the newborn pup, all the way through a dog's life, until its death or euthinasia. Dr. Vine writes as a caring, sensitive veterinarian, who understands dog lovers' emotions involving their dog(s), while at the same time being completely informative as to the stages of a dog's life, all the diseases, normal and abnormal (neurotic) behaviors, emergency treatments of all types, training dos and dont's, and Q & A sections too. And, throughout the book he interjects some of his own humorous stories and emotions too. Great book to have on hand and just to read!!"
3,Not as good as in the old days.,"Too bad,,Baron was once an OUTSTANDINGaftershave,,cologne, had lasting fragrance.When the maker failed years ago,the greatfragrance was gone.Oh,,for the days ofyesteryear,,,Current product is ok,but notlike the products used in the '70's."
1,Not as advertised,"This case DOES NOT look like it's advertised. I bought the white case, but the actual color of this product is a nasty yellowish-gray; it has a cheap black! plastic clip that looks like it will break in a week. And I agree with previous reviews, it looks like it was bought at a 99 cent store. Of the pictures posted, the one of the red case looks like the product you get."
2,leather case,The case is bulky and feels like you have a phone tied to your hip. This might be inpart due to the size of the Zen. You have to decide weather to wear you cell phone or the zen. The case is also not good when you want to go to the gym.
5,Great Flavor,This product has a great raspberry flavor and a nice color. The candy I made with it went fast. It's inexpensive and a single serving for my purposes.
5,Intense raspberry flavor.,"A fabulous product for adding flavor to just about anything. As a diabetic who's always looking for new ways to satisfy a sweet tooth, I use several drops to add some excitement to sugar-free frosting, a smoothie, sugar-free brownies and so on. Highly recommend. I've been using LorAnn oils for years."
3,Covers a lot of ground . . . but not always well,"Unlike many physics students, I grant a lot of leeway to books on mathematics for physicists. I think it's all right for an author to engage in hand-waving arguments if this enhances physical intuition or even to make the occasional statements without proof if this allows more ground to be covered. However, if a proof actually is presented, I expect this proof to be correct. In this book, proofs are sometimes only for special cases of theorems stated more generally and often contain logical errors."
2,No exercises at all,"I haven't actually read this book, but from just skimming it, I see that it contains no exercises at all. Without any exercises, it would be really hard to use this book for self study, and hope to retain the material. Based on the reviews, it looks like the better books available on the topic are ""Geometry, Topology and Physics"" by Nakahara, and ""The Geometry of Physics: An Introduction"" by Frankel."
4,Excellent overview and graphical explanation,"This book shows you the geometric view of some advanced mathematical topics. It can greatly assist your intuition of what is going on in a mathematical setting when reading a true mathematics book. Armed with this book the other advanced text in Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Differential Geometry make more sense from a Physics point of view."
2,A Different Sin,"About 1/2 of this book is spent with our protagonists separated. In the second half, the author grinds on, page after page in an exhausting dialog about the civil war and a heterosexual affair. FINALLY IN THE NEXT TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH ON THE LAST PAGE, our protagonists meet. If one is interested in a novel about two gay men, don't buy this. I'll check with Bruce Catton on the details of the civil war."
5,This Pay Per View Is Great,This pay Per View Was Great It Featured KJ Noons Yves Edwards Ron Waterman And Nick Diaz The Main Event Was KJ Noons Vs Yves Edwards This Match was Great And After This Fight Was The Shocking Fight Between KJ Noons And His Dad And Nick Diaz Like I Said Before This PPV Was Great.
4,The start of a very good thing.,"These guys have one of the freshest sounds and consistently awesome output of any band in years. It's pop punk, but without all the cliches and corny prom references. It's pop punk that will kick you in the junk.A must have for any (pop) punk lover. And their follow up effort, Mutiny Pop, is equally, if not even more, indispensable."
2,A little dissapointed,"If you have a previos experience in the field this book doesn't give you examples nor ways to discover how much bandwitdh you're really saving. So don't expect much from this book. If you want to have a general line-up of WEB CACHING, this is your book. It explains why caching is important but no more.I'd rather recommend SQUID:The definitive guide from the same author. That book will answer your questions."
5,Prompt Delivery,The item arrived on time and in the condition that was promised. I couldn't be any happier with the purchase and I'll make a point to shop through this store again.
1,WTC,I was expecting more visual interaction with the events of 911 on that day (inside & outside). The entire movie was shot inside the apt. with a little bit too much over-acting.Couldn't really recomend anyone to see it.
4,Primos Hardwood Grunter Call,"It was reasonably priced and does the job expected of it. On top of its price and functionality,I have include that it actually got to my house on time and for me thats huge."
3,Its just ok,"It doesn't do very well making doe bleets or fawn bleets at all.Buck sounds it does great, but it just doesnt hit the high pitches needed for does and fawns (to draw in those big mature does).I have 100% success with just making a bleep without the call to get does to stop and come into me, but this call hasn't worked once to draw them in and almost always scared the does away immediately."
3,Gift for step dad,I bought this item for my step dad and he seems to have liked it a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who would want to buy it!
5,SLAVERY'S TRUE HERITAGE,"On its surface a novel about corporate corruption, 'Family Lines' has at its heart the deeper message that, if you are a Southerner and black, you'd better love the white guy sitting next to you because chances are you have the same blood running in your veins, and ditto vice versa. If we are to love our families, we had better love each other, black or white. That, not division, is the true heritage of slavery."
4,"Great, buying 2nd one.",This flat iron is the best I've used. I bought it 5 years ago and have used it everyday on my thick wavy hair. It works excellent. Today one of the plates stopped heating (after 5 years of much abuse) so I am buying another!
3,Not A good as I hoped,"I used this straightener while on a recent vacation with friends and I loved how I only had to make one pass on my hair to get it silky smooth and shiny. However, there seems to be some issue with quality control as the unit I received does not seem to get nearly as hot and I have to go over the same section a few times. I will say it performs better than other straighteners I've owned."
4,Hot Tools Flat Iron 170 Watts Model 1190,"I love this flat iron. It is wide enough to handle big areas of hair at a time. It also heats up fast. Only problem I have is that is can't hold its temperature during use. It quickly cools down. However, the fact that it heats up fast makes up for it"
5,Love it!,"This flat iron is professional grade amazing! I have very thick, long, curly hair. On its hottest setting this flat iron does wonders on my hair. Products (mine at least) don't stick to the plates. I cannot live without it!"
4,Awesome Iron!,I bought the iron and use it regularly. It creates an awesome straight look for my naturally wavy hair. The only thing i think that hot tools should work on is being bale to get the back of your hair better. But over all i love the iron and are now thinking about but the curling iron.
1,Not What It Used To Be,"My last Hot Tools flat iron lasted for 15 YEARS of professional use. So, when it finally died recently I didn't hesitate to buy another. But, like everything else they don't make them like they used to. On about the tenth use, I turned it on to heat up and it made a popping sound, started to smoke and the handle melted. I had owned it for 35 days, (five days past Amazon's return policy) so I can't return it. I'm stuck sending it back to the manufacturer and paying shipping both ways. Boo!"
2,NOt the best product for African americans.,"This is a terrible straightener. It causes extreme breakage, it burns your hair off, your hair lacks movement(frozen) even the wind can't blow out your hair , and your hair becomes frizzy in a matter of minutes. I don't recommend this product for African Americans with virgin hair."
1,Bum one!,It didnt work! Upon first use out of the box it barely heated up twenty minutes later on highest setting. Ugh.
4,Best Kind of Flat Iron,"I have thick, wavy hair, and it was always hard to find a straightener that will actually STRAIGHTEN my hair. Hot Tools works really well. It only takes 30 seconds to heat up and once you straighten your hair, it's silky, smooth, and AMAZINGLY shiney. This flat iron is one of the best...it works really well, it works quickly, and it's cheap!***Just a tip, doing your hair in small sections works the best. One way to make create sections is to put your hair in a half ponytail and straighten. Then, take the hair that is pulled back and straighten it. Don't do too much hair at one time!!***"
4,This is a great Flat Iron,"This is my second. The first I bought from my salon 3 years ago. After 3 years of very heavy use it burned out. I was very happy to find it on Amazon. Very durable, doesn't rip your hair as you are using. Great for people with long, thick hair. I highly recommend!"
5,smooth finish,"This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It gives a smooth finish to my 4a type hair. Plus, it is affordable and lasts a long time. Definately worth the price and then some."
5,Hot Tool Review,My daughter has been through sooo many hot irons over the years. I use to spend alot of money on Chi's- only to have them break as well. The problem with less costly irons was that they don't get as hot as a Chi. This one does and it's very reasonably priced. My daughter is very happy with it.
5,Great Product,"Before I bought this flat iron my hair would pop back up with waves with in a couple hours.With this Iron set at the highest setting because my hair is so difficult to work with it actually stays flat!!My friend told me about this specific one, I tried hers and I love it, I will never again buy one from the local department stores.In case you wonder I have thick, wavy hair naturally.I would suggest a good conditioning spray before you use irons though just to save your hair.I love this iron...."
3,Not as good as the ceramic Hot Tools,"I used my sister in law's ceramic hot tools flat iron with great results. This one just doesn't cut it. I have very thick, wavy hair that is easily destroyed by humidity. This one does not leave my hair as smooth as ceramic flat irons and it also takes a few passes instead of just one to get it straight. If you have fine hair that doesn't have humidity problems I think this one would be fine for you, but it's not great on thick, wavy hair. It is definitely better than my old Conair one, though."
5,The Healing Room was aptly named,"The Healing Room was aptly named. I have gone through the grieving process, but did not really understand the emotions that I felt. I found this book to be extremely helpful in identifying my feelings. Even though I knew how it would end, I couldn't put the book down. This book is not complicated to read, and can be finished in one sitting. However, there is much to digest and I will want to open the book again and again. The Healing Room will be helpful for anyone who is experiencing, or has experienced, grief from any type of loss. I highly recommended it"
4,Nice sturdy folders!,"I was impressed with how sturdy these folders are. I use these frequently in my work, and was unable to find them in town. I would recommend these with no hesitation."
4,Irish Music with a modern twist,"Planxty, which I believe is no longer together, featured performer Davy Spillane, who most recently was a member of the Riverdance band. Traditional Irish (and one American) folk music, with systhesizers and other modern instruments, they have a kind of ""New Age"" touch to their music. Very good in the field, especially for those who appreciate Enya or Clannad."
4,Right on time information etc. Real Good--but pricey!,"This is a must-have for every Musician, Singer, Board of Directors and Pastor/Bishop! Its on the expensive side, but I guess the church is not paying the author properly, so, I'll presume he's recouping that money. LOL.*If you are in a church that refuses to pay you what you're worth (or even at all), get this book. Get informed. Meet with the Pastor, if nothing can be remedied....LEAVE THAT DAMN CHURCH! Enough is enough with these ungrateful ingrates of Pastors/Leaders.How are you Preaching the Word and not living it too? Get out now, if there can be no agreement.And might I add, don't become a Full-time church Musician or Director or etc. without drawing up your own contract.Hope this helps!*Also there are a lot of links given in this book, that isn't working or up-to-date. This book should be $15. But get the book."
5,I Built a house with this,"Have owned this for a little over 3 years now. No problems. The nail depth adjustment is a fine feature. Run it at 110 PSI.I am a DYI'r and just finished building a house. No problems.A little difficult driving stainless 16d nails into .6 treated SYP though . . .nothing that a 20 oz. Plumb hammer would fix though with a few good smacks. (on the nail, that is)I have been in building industry for over 20 years. Senco, buy it and you'll never need to get another."
1,It's NOT what I expected AT ALL,"Beware, this is not written for or by Jews! This is some X-tian missionary (and an evangelist, I think) rambling on about HIS INTERPRETATION of prophesies, etc. I am sending the book back after reading the inside cover. By the way, the author lives in Jerusalem and does work that is clearly forbidden by the Israeli law."
1,An big disappointment!,I am planning a trip to the ANWR Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and I hoped to gain insight about the region from the experiences of another. I expected to read about the wonders of the ANWR. What I found was a book that was full of negative advertisements to save the ANWR. Debbie Miller definitely is passionate about the ANWR and her book is the story of her crusade to save it. When she does tell of her journeys throughout the ANWR her story becomes sidetracked by her save the ANWR chant. The book fell short of my expectations.
3,Still a good value,"While the book was in good condition, it was obviously not ""new"" as advertised (the book had a used bookstore sticker on the side of it). However, I would have still purchased the book for the price had I seen the book before hand."
1,AVOID,"The content is this book is awful. This book is for a low level statistics class and fails at teaching even the basic concepts. If you want to learn math with words instead of numbers and symbols this is the book for you. I would not recommend this book to anyone. A better buy is Mathematical Statistics with Applications Sixth Edition Wackerly, Mendenhall, Scheaffer. I had that book for my MATH 483 class and it was a breeze. Can you believe it I actually enjoyed my statistics class!"
3,Statistics is not an easy class,This is a pretty good book for the challenging course of statistics. There are some good problems to solve and answers in the back of the book. It helps to have a ti 84 calculator with this book.
2,Novice at Stats,"I have never taken a Stats course before and I find this book deficient in several areas. First of all, I do not think it gives comprehensive explanation involving many concepts. Secondly, the problems at the end of each chapter incorporate formulas, equations of concepts that haven't been covered previously. Therefore, it's difficult to complete homework without much invesetigation and frustration! Lastly, I do not care for how the book refers back to previous examples on several occcasions. This cause you to have to jump back and forth in the book. Besides that, many of the illustrations have similar titles (e.g. example, figure, exercise..) and can lead to some confusion."
4,Not bad,"This book gives tons of examples in statistic application. It doesn't required high math skill. When I took statistic course in university, I found that the course are very theorectical and difficult to digest the contents. This book makes concepts easier to understand. I recommend undergraduate students to use it in complement with another theory based statistic textbook."
3,"Powerful, but blade bent","This item is now, and very powerful. The blade on mine bent the second time I used it. might of been my error, but I got this at a good price, Amazon shipping had it in next day. Great experience."
4,Here you go,Works very well. Good price also came with free shiping Comes with a nice case. Can't think of anything bad to say.
5,Strong enought,This saw was made for the weekend warrior. My son loves it andso do I. It's easy to get in tight places.
4,Black & Decker Sawzall,For $50 its a great product for modest home use... Not for the professional contractor or all day use because it gets very hot in short order... But minor home use its great..
4,Not bad for the money,"I bought this one based on price alone. There have been many times when having a reciprocating saw around the house would have been just the ticket. After looking around and not wanting to spend the money on a cordless I decided to give this one a shot and am glad I did. There is plenty of power for everything I've needed it for, the blade locking system is fine and provided you choose the proper blade for the task it will do what is needed. One thing to keep in mind is that blade selection is 75% of the equation with these things. Wood blade for wood, metal blade for metal, etc. DO NOT go with cheap blades and you won't be disappointed."
5,Great value,"I bought this saw a few years ago and have used it for a few small jobs. However, it proved itself this past weekend as we gutted our kitchen down to the studs. We used this saw to cut out an arch that was built into a breakfast nook area. It consisted of several layers of 2x4 boards, metal drywall corner pieces, metal mesh, etc. This saw zipped through all of that and we pulled the arch out in no time. I also used it to clean up the mess from our project and was impressed with how quickly it cut through the debris to make for more manageable pieces. I started my cleanup with a buddy's saw and its blade became stuck in a chunk of 2x4/plaster and I couldn't get it unstuck. I used my saw to get the other blade cut out and the rest of the structure cut up. This saw and a pack of good blades is all you will need for most demo projects!"
1,Very Disappointed with the IMAC,We purchased an IMAC for it's supposed amazing digital photo and DVD capabilities. We were very disappointed. iPhoto has crashed twice. We have lost entire folders of photos. Simple children's games screwed up settings and contiminated preference lists. It has never been the same after a simple upgrade. Would not recommend this one to anyone.
5,The Long Walk,This is one of the best books I have ever read. I sit back and wonder how a true story such as this one can't be #1 for years.
2,Read and enjoy as a novel,"Don't try and stretch your credibility to read it as a true story. (Walking impossible deserts, meeting bigfoot, etc) Great story none-the-less."
5,Great Read!,"I thought this book was one of the better books I've read in some time! True or not, it's a great read!"
5,Superb and Awe-Inspiring,"This book reiterates the incredible possibilites of people. To everyone I have shared this book with, it is simply incredible that anyone would have had the strength and stamina to go through what these men went through. It reaffirms ones faith in the future of mankind."
3,An amazing story - I just wish it was true,"This is an extremely gripping and truly amazing tale - but the fact that it may well be largely a work of fiction, rather than a true account, means I have had to give it only 3 stars. I don't agree with claiming something is true, when it isn't.I only found out that the book might not be genuine after I finished reading it. I was disappointed; to discover something is not genuine definitely takes value away from the story.It's still a great read - and I wish it was true - but there does seem to be a lot of evidence which suggests the much of the account is a work of fiction, not fact."
2,AN UNLIKELY STORY,"I don't doubt that the walk or something like it took place but the confessed lack of notes, maps or diary combined with the passing of time since the event and the significant guesswork employed takes the edge and the enjoyment off what turns into a rather monotonous story of escape, but such places did and do exist and people have escaped. In this case as a survival story it is an physically unlikely account of extended endurance in a hostile climate by men in a weakened state, and when you add in lengthy encounters with Yetis at close quarters and the temptation to close the book grew strong. I would imagine that the naming of names of the people in the prison camp would not have brought their gratutude. But for 99p it passed the time."
1,Embellished but True?,"I agree with the objections of Mr. Dunn, who points out several flagrantly impossible feats presented as fact. I, too, have spent a lifetime backpacking all over the world, and for a true outdoorsman it is impossible to suspsend disbelief sufficiently to take the author at his word.Nevertheless, many of the anecdotes seem too vivid to have been completely fabricated. Perhaps the author needlessly embellished an already amazing story to ensure a book deal? Perhaps, for example, they received quite a bit more help & guidance than the author lets on?It rather reminds me of ""A Million Tiny Pieces."" The author could have saved everyone a lot of trouble had he merely published it as autobiographical fiction rather than an autobiography."
5,I am in AWE...,"Unbelievably real. Totally engrossing. You won't believe it's true, but it is!!! I can truly say that I have never been so glued to a story."
5,Like Glue,"The book kept me glued to the pages for hours on end. I can't remember how many times I stopped to highlights points of intensity throughout. I've never read a piece of nonfiction in which men not only endured, but pushed themselves through their own hell.It wasn't until about halfway through reading that I head about the veracity of the book being put into question. The story seems almost unbelievable enough to categorize as fiction, but that might only be because it is so incredible.If you're looking for something epic and gripping this is the right book!Now to see how the film compares..."
4,Good story,My husband liked this book so much he had to have the companion Walker book too.It is a good story with great information about the will to survive.
5,WOW,"In a place so bleak, to find a bit of compassion from such an unlikely source that leads a courageous group to freedom....This was a great story. I'm grateful to be an American who has not endured war, prison, or work camps. I have passed the book on to numerous people who also couldn't put it down!"
4,Skeptics aside...,"I began reading this book with a keen sense of cynicism from the observations of skeptics who had critiqued The Long Walk. The story grabbed me after a few pages and I couldn't put it down. It didn't matter if it was true or not, even if he we lying it would be a classic fiction adventure novel. So dont worry about the truth, enjoy reading a captivating struggle for freedom and the triumph of the human will."
5,Uplifting,"I loved this book. Despite true hardship and perseverance, I felt a sense of hope and optimism portrayed throughout the incredible journey."
5,The Long Walk,"There is no way to comprehend what men will do to gain freedom. The lucid memory of the author carries the reader through every step from the Artic Circle to India which included up to nine days without food or water, day afterday. The natives they met along the 2,000 miles was an education in itselfPatsy K Barber"
1,It is too good to be true....,"If Rawicz's account of his escaping from the Soviet prison were true, it would be one of the most extraordinary testament to the human endurance. The author claimed that during the crossing of the Gobi desert in the middle of the summer, the escaping party didn't have a single sip of water for as long as fourteen days, ( whereas a normal human being needs as much as a gallon of water per day just to survival). Rawicz's account of crossing the Himalayan mountain range during the winter without food supply makes his story even less believable. He even claimed the party throwing rocks to a couple of Yeti to make them move out of the way! Little wonder in the fifty years since the book was first published, nobody else has confirmed Rawicz's story. One should read Heinrich Harrer's ""Seven years in Tibet"" for a little appreciation of just how much effort is needed to walk across the Himalayan range."
