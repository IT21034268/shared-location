2,I would suggest a different headset,"The Plantronics M2500 sits at a tilt in your ear and feels a bit heavy. Most people I talk to say the microphone picks up a lot of background noise. Even in a quiet room, I'm told I sound like I'm in a crowded lunchroom. I would not buy this headset again. Though a bit more expensive, I recommend the Plantroincs Discovery 640."
1,Waste of Money,"I am using this device with an HP IPaq 6315, which is admittedly not the world's greatest phone to begin with.The Plantronics is basically useless unless you can insulate yourself from external sound sources. So you can exclude such mundane uses as walking on city streets. In Manhattan the only way I could hear another person was to cup one hand over the Plantronics unit. If I wanted to do that, I could have just held the phone to my ear. What's the point of a hands-free connection that requires hands to use?Keep shopping and leave this thing on the store shelves, where it belongs."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for use with a Treo 650.It took a couple of tries to get the two devices to play nicely together.The instruction manual is particularly hard to follow. Each page has a cryptic drawing followed by a single sentence in about ten languages, followed by another cryptic drawing, etc. The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate precisely even for someone with small hands.The battery does not hold a charge for anywhere near the hours it is supposed to on standby.I have fairly small ears close to my head, and the headset always feels like it is about to fall off. Sometimes it actually has fallen off.The rubber gizmo that is supposed to rest inside the ear comes detached *very* easily. The unit ships with two spare gizmos, which may not last me a month.Sound quality is okay but all in all this is a long run for a short slide. Plantronics usually makes better products than this."
3,Watch out for fit,"While I found the range to be quite decent (>20ft on a Nokia 6230) and sound quality to be a bit staticy but still fairly good, the thing just didn't fit very tightly. The headset is large and moves around easily, particularly if you use the buttons a lot or wear glasses."
1,"Argh. I ignored reviews, as they were conflicting","So, because of the ""It's great!"" vs. ""IT SUCKS"" reviews, I ordered a few of these for people at my office. We have voip phones, and staff in New York, Portland, and... I wanted one myself because they seem neat.Everyone hates them, and we're all using different hardware. It works ""Fine"" with my Motorola a630, until is disconnects randomly or if I need to use while moving *At all*, then it becomes excessively staticy. I also want to use it with my laptop at times, for the softphone, and... what a huge pain. I still can't figure out how to make this stable.Other people are using it strictly with a PC or a Mac (both, in this case) for voip soft phones... and they either stop working randomly, are staticy, and in one case the mic just sounds HORRIBLE on the other end.suck. Will return them all, I guess, in exchange for something ""better"". sigh."
2,"Fits nice, sounds lousy (to others)","PROS:Fits wonderfully. You can wear it for hours comfortably, and it won't fall off.Plenty loud enough, with easily controlled volumeSound quality is excellent for you, but....CONS:Everyone I called said they had trouble understanding me.Battery life seemed low. Lasted only about a day on standby.Hard to turn on/off.As a result of the cons, I've returned this item."
1,People can't hear you clearly.,"I was really excited getting a bluetooth headset. But it turned out to be a bad experience with this one. You can hear other people clearly, but when you talk they can barely hear you, the people on the other end said, that they felt like i was talking on a speakerphone probably 50 feet away.I used it with the Nokia 7610.Pros - PriceCons - Bad sound quality, the headset can be broken easily if stretched too much while putting it on."
2,Nice Design / Bad Performer,"I have yet to evaluate other units - but I can say that this unit no where near approaches the 5 hr battery life. I am a lawyer and am trying to use this unit with my blackberry. I got about 1.5 hrs of talk time out of the box and then slence. It also appears that stand by time is limited when the device is ""connected"" via bluetooth to the blackberry device. The best I can discern is that there are frankly not that many bluetooth devices but once more blackberrys and cellphones support headsets like this, I would hope and expect performance to significantly improve. Right now this device is absolutlely not ready for prime time. If you are a gadget freak and your girlfriend doesn't mind you wearing an imbeded headset - go for it. Otherwise, practical minded businesspersons should avoid this headset."
2,crackling and windy sound from the other person's (listener),"On my treo 650, and my gf's sony ericson phone with bluetooth, there were crackling and windy sound was noticed and annoyed by the person I'm calling or talking to. It sometimes will connect clear and others not when I listen, but it always was crackling and had a that windy sound according to the person I'm talking to.I have to say that the fit is great, and it is very light. Talk time is probably 3.5 to 4 hrs. Too bad you can't replace the battery on this, it it will be disposed when the battery loses charge."
2,There are better ones out there,I have tried this product. It worked fine for couple of days after I bought it. Now it needs to be charged almost every 2 hours. It loses connection whenever and wherever. would not recommend this product.
1,Plantronics M2500,"The item is a scam... I got the unit from Plantronics. Before I purhased the item I asked if this items works with HP6315 iPaq. They say yes... A week after I received the items I was having a lots of problems with it, So, i call Plantronics ... Now there story was that the M2500 has a clitch with iPaqs. For the unit to work properly I had to so a soft RESET after every use. Everytime I got a message I had to manually reset the M2500. They refuse to return my money. (Buyers beware of ""Plantronics"" products)"
5,"I am partially deaf ,, I like this product","... it sticks into your ear enough to give good conduction. The fit sometime feels loose, but yu don't realy want something totally stuck onto the ear canal anyway.Charge time, setup and other that other is great."
3,Just Average so far,"I bought this item on Monday and I have found it average at best. I like the fit of it. At first glance I thought that it would be bulky but once I got it to fit, I forgot I had it on. Battery life for is awesome. I haven't had to recharge mine since I got it. The first one I bought from Amazon was quite staticy and had a tendency to drop my connection from time to time. I call Plantronics and they are sending me a replacement so I hope that one will be better than this one. I will post again when I get my new one. (3 weeks later)....After trying out my replacement headset with another phone as well as my own, I've found that this model headset is total crap. For the range that you get, you might as well be wired to your phone which pretty much defeats the purpose of having Bluetooth in the first place. I suggest spending the extra money on something else and staying away from this one at all costs."
2,Unless you have a very quiet place to talk...,"The problem with Bluetooth headsets in general is they are near your ear but 4-5 inches your mouth. Therefore the microphone is reaching a long way to pick up your voice and has little ability to screen your voice from everything else around you. Unless you are in a quiet room, forget the current offerings of Bluetooth headsets.This headset is no exception. There is a little rubber ear piece with sound holes one one side that swivels to accommodate left or right ear. Unfortunately this rubber piece eventually gets loose and falls off. Plantronics apparently knows this as they include two. I lost both.On the other hand, it is comfortable and works well if you need it where it excels, a quiet room.However, I'll wait until an offering is available that works outside the quiet confines of the design lab."
1,Did not work well,"I bought this from Amazon and it did not work. The volume will completely drop down after a few seconds on a call. Thought it was a defective unit, got a replacement and that too behaved exactly the same way. Although a friend of mine bought the same model from a local store and I tried that - that worked very fine.I really liked the fit and how the mechanics are behind the ear unlike the usual ones where the product hangs outside the ear - looking dumb. I would have really liked this M2500, if it worked!"
4,"Great item, Great Buy","I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about this product after reading the reviews, but the positive ones swayed me. I'm glad they did because I really enjoy the headset. The calls are clear and I haven't had a single dropped call. I have a Blackberry 7100T.There are two reasons I don't give it 5 stars. First, speaker piece that fits inside the ear is a bit too large for my ear and is a little uncomfortable. Secondly, the on/off/volume switch has to be pushed in just right to turn it off or on. Not really a big deal, but could be frustrating for the impatient types.If you're looking for a good buy on a Bluetooth headset, I recommend this one."
2,Decent at Best,The ear piece does not stay in your ear properly and people on the other end have a hard time hearing you. I would not recommend it.
4,Light weight and good sound,"In contrast to the people that had problems with this headset, I can only express my complete satisfaction. It is one of the most comfortable earpieces I have experienced and when I ask the people on the other side of the call, they mostly cannot tell a difference whether I am speaking through this headset or directly into my phone. Needless to say that for me the reception is certainly so much nicer through the headset than if I were to put my phone to my ear, especially while driving the car.I guess that a car charger (it comes with a wall charger) would be nice, but certainly would increase the price on this already lower priced unit."
1,HORRIBLE,"I can hear just fine, but the people I call can only hear a broken robot. Terrible product, and waste of money!"
2,Bad,"This headset is very uncomfortable, and does not get as good a battery life as the Motorola's or Jabra's. Spend an extra $20 or so and get something you'll use more than twice. This is really disappointing as Plantronics makes really good wired headsets."
4,Lightweight and works great!!,I have tried a couple of different wireless headsets and this one is the most comfortable so far. It holds a charge for 3-4 days and is very clear.
2,Worst on/off switch.,"I got this headset because it was cheap. I'd recommend spending a few extra bucks on something nicer.The main problem is easily turning it on or off. It always feels like a guessing game. To turn the headset on, you have to push down a scrolling multifunction button for several seconds, and wait for little light. This is a really bad on/off switch.The rest of the controls are fine and easy to use, but the on/off switch is the one control that everyone uses the most!Sound quality is great both ways.Large but not uncomfortable."
2,"Was excited, till I made a phone call","I was excited when I got it, I had background checks on this item and was rated very highly, but it is really Staticy. SO much, I had to buy a different one. DO not waste your money."
2,Disappointed and sending it back,"I tried this headset with my brand new Treo 650. It sounded like an old-time LP with cracks and static so bad it was distracting from the conversation. I only chose this brand because a magazine recommended it. As soon as I find the magazine, I'll be sure to remember to ignore their reviews."
3,Decent quality,"This piece is priced towards the low end and it is satifying for that price.The inital connection with my T610 was seamless. And here after my phone has no problems locating the 2500 whenever the range is close.The battery life on continous use worked out for me as mentioned in the manual. I havent yet got the time to test the standby time. The voice is clear most of the times. But at certain times, depending on the location, the signal gets weak and the voice is noisy. But that is only for 20% of the total conversation I had.There is voice dialing, volume control, mute on this piece thus maaking it more useful. Also the charger is quick to charge the 2500."
3,Fun while it lasted..,"It finally died on me after about a year of moderate usage. As others have noted the on-off switch is quirky, and you would never know if it won't start, as if finally did. Sound qualtiy was actually quite good both ways, used with my RIM 7100t and with Skype using a Linksys Bluetooth USB adapter. A decent entry-level BT headset, but I am moving to a Jabra BT250v. will give a review of that when that arrives."
2,Plantronics M2500,This headpiece is very uncomfortable to wear after just a few minutes. My ear really started to hurt. Also people were having trouble understanding me when I was using it.
2,not recommended to other customer,"delivery on time, comes as expected. item head up too fast and power is not for long. I throw away after a few days use"
2,Close but no cigar...,"I have had several Plantronics Bluetooth headsets,This one works fine, paired easy, has good controls,however, it is not made to use with a lot of back ground noise, you can hear, but the person on the other end has trouble hearing over the noise.Maybe in an office or for home use it would be OK."
2,Uncomfortable and confusing,"This was my first bluetooth headset and it was just bad. Very inexpensive, but still not even worth the value. It grips the ear in a very uncomfortable way and everyone I spoke to complained about the sound quality."
4,nice Item,I can say it's a good item but the describtion was not precise. it's only good for using on the right ear and it's an old style .. overall I will give it 4 out of 5 to be fair.thanks
2,"Uhh, could be WAY better...","I've been trying out the M2500 with my new Treo 650. I can say that if this is what Bluetooth is all about, then it's not ready for prime-time.The unit fits well enough, if you don't mind things stuck inside your ear. I prefer the type that rest ""over"" the ear. The sound control is good (compared to a Motorola unit I tried). But overall, the unit just isn't there.If you get over 2-3 feet away from you phone, it gets pretty scratchy, and people you're talking to will let you know. I thought Bluetooth was good up to 30 feet?This could be an issue that resides in the Treo 650 also? I don't know, but I'm going to have to give this one a thumbs down. :(Best Wishes,Jivedaddy.com"
1,A real piece of junk,The real fell apart bringing in a fish and I lost the fish. Had to buy another real for it. Pole bends over bringing in a bluegill.
2,Uncomfortably tight if you use the right wraps,"I ordered these gloves in 12oz and found them too tight. I am an average size woman (5'2"") with small hands, and the fit was very tight, and my hands and fingers were painfully cramping up when I had wraps on. These gloves may be more suitable for children and teenage girls. I ordered the regular everlast pro style training gloves and they fit much better."
4,Great starter set,"I purchased 2 sets of these gloves for friendly sparring within the house hold. My siblings and I are about the same size 5'2 so I purchased the 12oz. They fit great, love the color and not as heavy as they appear they might be. Only cons I had was the lining builds up sweat fast which makes it hard to grip the piece inside while your fist are clenched. Happy with the set they are well made love the pink and they come with a mesh bag for storage."
3,good value,"at the 1st time ,it was too tight and hurt my fingers,but i put water bottles for days and finally because loose enough to use.anyway it was much cheaper to buy here, it cost hk$330 (include shipping) but it cost 600 in local shops in hong kong. for next time, i want to buy 14 onz which is wider( not tight inside) and better protection."
4,8oz great for smaller hands,"I purchased the 8oz model as a gift for a female; 5'3"" with a small frame and small hands. When I say small hands, I mean she often buys kids sized gloves. I also purchased the 108"" hand wraps. Both worked out to be a good fit for her. These are being used as bag gloves, not boxing/contact gloves. The fit and finish are similar to my own Fairtex and Windy bag gloves."
5,love them,"I am 6' tall and have big hands, these fit me perfect. I enjoy using them because they fit so well and they don't hurt my hands no matter how hard I hit the bag."
1,Horrible Quality! Lasted only a month,"I bought these gloves for teaching and training purposes. I teach classes and train 4 days a week. If you plan on using these more than two times a week, invest in a GOOD pair instead of these. Cheaply made, fell apart at the seams after just one month of use."
3,Getting A Little Stale...,"Salvation is a detour from the main Preacher storyline. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just that there is absolutely nothing new here at all. Custer goes to a small texas town and takes care of the bad guys. So what? In the process, Ennis espouses the same old predictable, tired themes...Be nice to misfits and people who look funny...Nazis are bad, bad bad... Black people should be treated as well as white people. Now there's nothing wrong with these ideas, but it's getting old.Steve Dillon is a good artist, but his limitations in character drawing is really showing. He is utterly unable to draw unique character faces. The one-eyed woman, for example is just a Cycloped Tulip. Everyones' eyes look alike.It's still one of the best books going, and definitely worth the read. The requisite weidness and violence is all there."
4,Even without the gang....,"Seems to be a mixed reaction to this story. Personly I enjoyed it a lot, the new charaters like Jesse's mom and Cindy are very good and Quincannon is a good bad guy so I'm giving it a 4 but I'm geting a very X-files feel to the series. It appears to move without ever going anywhere and if the next one is the same then I going to rate it much lower."
5,Awesome Comic!,"I love this series and after checking out my local book stores, I found the 2 titles I was missing on Amazon.The book was in good condition, was delivered within a week!As far as the series is concern, this is a fun, fast, addicting series.I love that there is an ending, unlike other comic series that i am reading, so owning the 9 trades won't hurt my wallet or my book shelf space."
4,the weakest in the series,"Salvation is the weakest of the nine collections, but that isn't to say it is bad in any way, it's still a darn good book (and really, it is only weak compared to its own work, and not that much weaker). The real problem is that for a while we are taken completely out of Jesse's quest to find God. And Tulip and Cassady are both missing. Maybe for a one shot it would have worked, but we were too far from where we need to be, especially at this point."
2,The worse Preacher storyline but still good,"after the amazing War in Sun and Proud Americans, this collection was a piece of **** (but still good compared to other stuff). first of all, it ONLY stars Jesse who does nothing playing sheriff in a hick down. I read this for the biblical armageddon stuff, the Grail, Starr, violence, Saint of Killers, etc. this had NONE of it! I don't why Ennis decided to waste a precious year of Preacher with this ****..."
2,"Cars, Cars, Cars and Nothing but Cars","Beware this is not a book about the 50's, but a book about cars of the 50's, well actually more of the late 40's then the 50's. This book is marketed as a general book about the 50's but it is completely about cars. The section on fashion is one page, showing a man in a leather jacket. The section on magazines, is one page showing a car magazine. The section on TV is a page showing cars. If you want to know everything there is to know about cars in the late 40's to mid 50's then this is for you. But if you want to learn about anything else, look elsewhere. I ordered this book for my Mom and she was so disapponted that we are going to return it."
3,"Easy, but okay...","This book is quite pictorial and thus easy to read, as it's intended to be: a first introduction on undergraduate level to topology. However, it's a pity it doesn't go into topology very much. It stays very informal."
1,Greatest Hurt,"I expected this book of authorized arrangements to have the piano music which is prominent in her recordings. This book only has guitar chords, melody and lyrics."
5,There's nothing like a Cuisinart!!!,"I used my other immersion blender many, many times ... until I dropped it on the floor! When it came time to replace it, this Cuisinart model was the one for me. The price was right, the name brand was right, and it's a beauty! That red is gorgeous. I've used it many times and it has performed -- and cleaned up -- well each time."
5,I'm in love!,"I just got this product, but I'm already completely hooked. It works fabulously! I used it tonight to blend ingredients for a vegan alfredo sauce - I would say it took about 5 seconds to make it the perfect, smooth consistency. And clean up was simple. Plus the red is so pretty! What more could you ask for?!?! HIGHLY recommended!"
2,Great item..too bad it only lasted 6 months,"I was so impressed by this kitchen device that I bought it as a gift for three people last Christmas. I had purchased my own Red Smart Stick in November but by the following May the blade shaft had become so distorted that it no longer fit onto the motor component. I do not know for sure what happened to cause the plastic to warp. I can only guess that it was not really dishwasher safe as it said in the instructions. Cuisinart agreed to replace the entire unit as a replacement shaft was not available in the same shade of red. I still think it is a handy and affordable device, but I will definitely be hand washing it from now on."
2,"didn't hate them, but didn't love em","these are soooo pretty and when i got them i was thrilled, until i tried them on.they are soooo high and have no ankle support. it was like wearing a pump that just had a sole and no sides to hug your foot.at first i thought maybe it was just too big, but the length was right and the width was normal for me....they are just really high, which i don't normally have issue with...something just wasn't right...."
2,Incomplete,"In general I have been happy with Target furniture, but this piece arrived without directions. When I complained to Target and then to the packing company, they assured me I would receive a replacement directions packet within 3 working days. It has now been two weeks and the pieces are still sitting in my bedroom. It has been a frustrating experience to deal with these companies."
2,Disappointed and Annoyed Customer...,"When I saw these items I thought it was perfect the price for the look. I looked everywhere including IKEA and couldn't find such a great deal.I read some of the reviews before purchasing this item and noticed people complained about getting this item (scratched/damaged) I wish I would have listened because the same happened to me. I purchased 2 items the Secretary desk in black and the 2dr black Armoire and they both were damaged.The Desk came chipped and scratched and the armoire came broken in half. So I warn you if you are prepared for the aggravation of ordering this item, waiting home for the pick up of the damaged item and then waiting home another day for the delivery of the new item then be my guest.Also none of the pieces come labeled so it is like trying to put together a puzzle. Whoever created the assembly of these items obviously was not thinking of the average person."
1,foolish mortals! hiss,"It's kinda funny how something once seen as subversive like dissonant lo-fi black metal can be milked with the careerist intensity of your average rock band. All Xasthur albums pretty much follow the same formula, so if you've heard one, you've more or less heard this one too. And at this point, the pathos is strained and seems disconnected from the real world in the worst way; Xasthur's angst is like a hissing cartoon vampire cursing a smiling cartoon sun with sunglasses.The Europeans did this stuff a lot better. Try Mutiilation instead; they flirted with some of the same ""grim kvlt"" cliches but put out some really strong and distinct albums."
5,a true masterpiece,"it's like horenstein's advance from the vox (vienna symphony) version of bruckner's 9th, and his bbc philharmonic offering, decades later. the difference is obvious. this recording shows similar maturity, compared to the vox version of horenstein's 'youth'. relativity aside, as a stand-alone performance it maps out most insightfully what can only be said to be the last work of an era. unlike klemperer, this version doesn't seem to overburden one,(though that may have been mahler's intent...)opting instead for a deeply spiritual, fascinating journey through life and what may lie beyond, tempered by an emerging acceptance of both. the botched parts referred to above seem to be a staple of some of horensteins later conducting, and i dont put it in the realm of impossibility to suggest it intentional, as it would further inform the chaotic ambience of the movement...rest assured this one is a keeper."
3,BODY BOOTS AND BRITCHES,A GOOD BOOK WITH LOTS OF INTERESTING INFORMATION. HAS TOO MANY BALLADS AND SONGS FOR MY OWN TASTE BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT SORT OF THING YOU'LL BE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF BALLADS FROM EARLY AMERICA.
2,Terrible for language review,"Compared to other books by Miller, this is a big disappointment. The photos are poorly cropped so you can barely see what baby's holding/eating. I bought the book for my son because he's been trying to learn food words and I thought I would use it to label. However, besides a banana and a cracker, there isn't any food in this book. The other pages are ""spoon"" (which is fine, at least it's close), ""bottle"" (which my breastfed son doesn't even recognize), ""yummy"" and ""messy"". Couldn't Miller find other actual foods out there to photograph? If your child is an infant and just wants to see baby faces, try a different Miller book. If your child is older, this is not a language acquisition tool."
3,Baby Food . . . good for a few minutes of distraction.,"Baby Food is a series of close-up baby pictures with one word descriptions like ""messy"", etc. Like most babies, my son (9 months) is fascinated by the faces of other babies. This book is worth five bucks to me but it's not something that you will spend a significant amount of time with. I sometimes open a PARENTS or CHILD magazine and point to pictures of babies for my son to look at while he sits on my lap. This book is sort of the same thing."
2,Small Book,"The book is a favorite with many of the children I have worked with in Sunday School, babysitting,grandchildren, etc. But the original book was larger. I overlooked the size dimensions. I really wish the publisher had not reduced the size."
4,From rags to a hero and back,"Unlike ""Kiss of the spider woman"" [...] this movie provides inside into the makers of history, where deception, personal gist for power and by-date imminent interest rule.Due to an accustomed trend of contemporary show- bestsellers, creators deploy sexual fantasies game and dominantress to memorize a dramatic eclipse of a story where a way from rags to a hero and back lasted about a quarter of century, blood, tortures and murders follow.Nice performance, beautiful cast and intrigue depicted simplistically, and a ""nave soldier"" Joe does not look like a young recruit at all.This dramatic story is of a very gloomy vogue final."
4,The implacable wheel of fate!,"The cruel metaphor of the restless cycle of the power, tragic and irreversible. When a simple officer who keeps in prison to a dangerous political prisoner, begins to think and eventually aids him for the unavoidable coup d' etat. Once Thorne comes to power, his delirious thirst of repressed instincts will flow and in the name of the great ideals of democracy and liberty, the shadows of opression wing over the nation to refound a new tyrany. But this man assumes a bold and courageous attitude that eventually will lead him to dark horizons.Witty and satyrical flim that reveals the eternal wheel of the history. Those who fight for arriving the power, once they reach it, then fight for keep themselves.Sutherland and Fiennes are the driving forces of this movie. No doubt ."
2,Depressing Political Satire,"I just wanted to pass on the information that this film while it tells the all to true story of how dictators works, it is a real downer that drags on and on. Our hero was stupid, he was to idealistic and should have gone with the flow. END OF THE STORY."
4,Small 3d world dictatorship movie classic.,"This movie needs to be watched from beginning to end to get the whole story. But, it is worth it. Interesting music too."
1,Don't waste your time,I bought this DVD because I like Ralph Fiennes as an actor but this film is just too bizarre - off the charts - to be enjoyable. The story is so ridiculous that there is no amount of acting that can save it. To me this is the kind of film that seems to drag on forever with outcome obvious from almost the very beginning so what's the point of watching something that is nothing more than absurd theater. Sorry for being blunt but that's how I see it - thank god it's over.
3,A Hodgepodge Movie Trying to Figure Out What It Wants to Be,"LAND OF THE BLIND is a strange horse of a film. It is so full of gimmicks, silly scenes, awkward dialogue, and mixed metaphors that it sinks under its own intended farcical weight.Robert Edwards wrote and directed this take off on totalitarian governments and the crises that arise with the corruption of power, sprayed it globally and historically so that it can include everyone in its aim, and shot it in a Felliniesque fashion that just falls short of significance. Abetted with a strong cast of actors (Ralph Fiennes, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander, Lara Flynn Boyle, etc) one would think this overproduced piece would have made it. But alas is sinks into somnolence despite its oh-so-very-obvious attempt to be a significant statement about politics today. The biggest task required for this movie is trying to stay awake to the final frame. Grady Harp, September 06"
1,Pointless and Tasteless,I don't know how distinguished actors like Feines and Sutherland can let themselves be degraded by performing in such a piece of trash. The writer and director have a truly sick bathroom obsession. Skip this one.
3,A different world,"With a subtle and graceful precision, Jones renders the lives of gay men and boys in Wales and of Welsh heritage. Through varying viewpoints, he explores notions of family, homophobia, coming out, and more in this excellent collection of short stories. Some of the stories tease and beg for more, and there are a few that are just not as compelling as others. All told, this is a remarkable book that will interest anyone curious about other cultures."
3,A little disappointing,"I was all excited about this product because I had read great reviews on it. When I used it, it was ok, but it didn't give the ""wonderful"" experience that I had read about. However, I used it in the ""backdoor"" and it provided a good experience. Not my favorite toy, but not a waste either."
2,less funny than obnoxious,"This author reminds me of the kid we all knew in high school who got a big laugh at one of her jokes and from that point on, it was ""all stand up, all the time"". I think the punch of her wit is watered down substantially by the fact that we see it in virtually every single line. We get it! You're funny! Now, will you please get on with the story?? I'm only halfway through but I honestly, i have no desire to continue. Enough already."
5,Great book... Notaro at her best!,I love this book probably the most out of the Laurie Notaro series. I am currently reading her 4th book (We Thought You Would Be Prettier) and I definitely think Fat Bride was the best overall. So glad that I got into this series
2,Unsatisfied,"I am engaged and preparing for my wedding, I thought that this book would be a fun read. I found that this book was extremely anti-climatic and there was absolutely no plot. I did laugh out loud several times while reading this book, but a more appropriate title would be Fat Bride turns Fat House Wife: A collection of super short stories. Another reviewer said that this book ""tried"" their nerves. I felt exactly the same, it was such a quick and easy read from the start but was such a struggle to finish."
2,Not enough LOLs,"Notaro has an interesting perspective on life and is someone who I'd love to have as a friend. However, as a comedian writer, the real laugh out loud moments were few and far between."
2,not as funny as her first book,"My friends and I were very disappointed by this book, which is not as original as book one. Perhaps it is simply that too much time is devoted to The Wedding. In general weddings bore me a little. I felt that Notaro seemed more tame and less blissfully self-involved than in her first book, whciih is probably better for her personal life but much less exciting reading. I will give her other books a chance however"
1,Potty humor is only so funny.....,"I guess I'm in the minority here. I really didn't find this book too funny.Definitely NOT escapist literature here! After the 20th doody comment, 12th BO joke, and umpteenth gross hygiene story, (and I'm barely half way through the book) I was ready to throw the book in the trash. Being an un-glamour girl myself, I was looking forward to a book about people like me. I like to think we 30 something women have a little more class and refined sense of humor than jr. high school boys! The humor gets a bit repitiously gross in this book. You've been warned!"
3,"Funny for about half the book, tried my nerves for the other","This is the first book I've read by this author. Judging by the synopsis on the back cover I purchased it. I laughed out loud for several chapters, even at the never-ending poo jokes. It finally got to the point where this disjointed story just tried at my nerves and I wanted it to end. In the beginning her habits are charming. She's overweight. Her men keep running off (which are the most interesting chapters in the book). However, after she gets married it just goes downhill from there. I don't want to hear about stepping in cat poo. Her touch of laziness became downright slovenly and I could practically smell her through the pages. Her mother began sounding more and more reasonable. And that husband of hers is pathetic.Buy this book for a little summer fluff. Or to put in your winter fire to keep you warm. I personally recommend ""The Devil Wears Prada"" over this or even ""The Nanny Diaries""."
3,Not Bad,"Notaro's second outing isn't actually bad. I could especially relate to everything that happens after she gets married. I didn't truly care for her first book, but I found this one to have more humor and be more relatable. In this book, she seems more human.The book picks up where ""Idiot Girls..."" left off. She's looking for a good man, gets married, her sister has a baby and she decides she wants a house in downtown Phoenix. Of course, those of us that live here are wondering what was she thinking, but that's beside the point. Downtown Phoenix has it's special charms. All her trials and tribulations in the book are understandable if you know where she's coming from. It also helps if you have been in similar situations of marriage and home-owning, etc.Try it if you must, it's definately better than the first. Yet, there are more valuable things you could waste your time with."
1,HATED IT!,"To each her own, but I thought it was idiotic, and, I won't buy anything else written by this author."
1,Anesthesia for 30-Somethings,"Being on the cusp of 50 and harboring an IQ well above average, I was bored by this ""woe-is-me"" tale of 30-something angst. I found the scatalogical humor to be juvenile and the story itself paralyzingly dull. If this is the type of book that young women find engaging, I fear the gains of feminism have been lost.If you are intelligent, thoughtful reader, save your money and pass by this dull, narcissistic book."
5,Terrifically Funny,"I laughed out loud more times reading this book than any other I've read in years. Notaro has brilliant powers of observation about the mundane and a wicked, almost evil, sense of humor that rarely fails. I've not read her first book, but plan to. The characters are great: the hostile QVC Shopping Channel-addict mother, the out-of-touch with reality grandmother, the long-suffering husband, the royal emperor spoiled-brat nephew, and of course, the author, desperately attempting to stay one-step ahead of White Trashdom. This book is a perfect plane read."
5,Laugh So Hard You Cry,"Laurie Notaro's books are those kind of books where you finish it then have to pick it up and read it again until you can get the next one. With each book, you can't help but wonder how a woman can meander into such hilariously horrendous episodes. Her fans are just glad she wrote them down.The countdown to Notaro's newest: April 19, 2005"
3,Pretty funny...,"I enjoyed this book. I was not doubled over laughing or ""in need of Depends"" as others have suggested, but if you are in the mood for a light-hearted, quick read -- this is a pretty good book. It makes all the crazy things I've done in life seem a little more normal. It probably won't change your life, but it might make you smile for a while."
3,Not as funny as Idiot Girls or I Love Everyone,It is a good read. I just did not have the outbursts of laughter that I experienced with Idiot Girls Club and I Love Everyone. I am glad that I read it though.
2,Not as funny as everyone says it is...,"I felt this book was all over the place, the MULTIPLE chapters were annoying. The author thinks she is funnier than she really is and I found myself just wanting for it all to be over. Maybe I'm not like everyone else and this book wasn't written for girls like me BUT the bad hygiene, laziness and white trash ways in this book really turned me off. I already have the next book ""I Love Everybody"" and granted I will probably read it, I am contemplating taking it to the used book store and finding something else."
5,Notaro's view of the world is wonderfully askew!,Autobiography of a Fat Bride is full of laugh-out-loud chapters on her adventures as a bride and a new wife. A must-buy!
1,Why do atrocious writers get published?,"I have a Ph.D. and I am appalled by the grammatical errors in this woman's books. I think it is remarkable that she procured an agent and that her books have been published. The syntax is beyond poor; there are misplaced modifiers and commas, inaccurate use of words, overblown, florid language, and sentences that make no sense. Yet, she is represented by the Bent Agency which I thought had a good reputation. This phenomenon is further proof that the current state of fiction has everything to do with what sells than with beautiful writing. The Ann Tyler's and Jane Smiley's of this world are few and far between."
4,out-there funny,Very funny book--think Erma Bomback on crack. Found myself (52 year old grandma) laughing out loud.
3,Handle broke after first use,"I guess that's what you get when you buy a pole for about 10 dollars. My only other complaint would be the amount of fishing line on this ""pre-rigged"" pole. There's only about 40 feet of line and when the fish finder show the fish at 55 feet you're sol unless you add more line yourself.Save yourself some trouble and spend a little bit more on a better pole."
1,iPAQ replacement battery,I give it one star only because i can't give it a zero. This does NOT fit the iPAQ's the vendor says it will. I live in Alaska & return shipping would cost more than the product is worth. Needless to say this vendor will get no more of my business.
5,Five Star Cast--Five Star Singing,"Norma with Sutherland at her height; the youthful and powerful singing of Cossotto as Adalgisa; Charles Craig as a heroic and ringing Pollione. Truly amazing singing in the duets and ensemble pieces--my favorite is always the Act I finale and here it is sung in full glory, with Sutherland capping it off with one of her signature unearthly high notes. Get this and add to your other Norma recordings, you won't be disappointed!"
2,Not Sturdy,Not a very sturdy product. It will break easily with normal use and handling by kids. You need a large empty space and good wind to fly. A vacant lot will not do it.
2,review,this book is out of date and bought it for the price. bought the most recent updated version and use it everyday.
4,That was easy.,"A quick summary of the disease and nutrition intervention. Great tool and better that Krause's Food and Nutrition Therapy book, which after reading you still feel clueless."
5,Nutrition and Diagnosis - Escott-Stump,Excellent reference material for dietitians. Recommended by a student intern and have used it many items in my clinical practice.
3,GREAT MOVIE--so so sound track,"Gloomy Sunday is great(in its original english language version--by Billie Holiday------It is hungarian) this one is OK. The only highlight on this so-called soundtrack is THE AFGHAN WHIGS ""beware"" which is also on their CD ""UPTOWN AVONDALE"". The rest of this soundtrack is, simply put, all right---nothing great--but has its good spots here and there."
4,a soundtrake that takes you into the woods with the students,"A COLLECTION OF MUSIC PERFECT FOR A NIGHT LOST IN THE WOODS. NOTHING SUMS UP EERIE FEELINGS LIKE A REMAKE OF BILLY HOLIDAY'S ""GLOOMY SUNDAY"" OR ANYTHING BY THE ULTRA SOMBER BAUHAUS. WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE WOODS OR JUST LOOKING FOR A GREAT CD FOR A DARK STORMY NIGHT, THIS IS A SURE HIT."
5,Appropriate Music,"This is a great collection of both early and recent alternative and goth, and fits the movie. The last track is the only one heard on film. Obviously if you don't like this type of music don't get the CD. The short clip on the enhanced part is also not in the film."
1,I don't get it.,"As best as I can remember, the only song that was in the movie was the tune that was playing on the car radio when they pulled up to the guy's house and Heather asked if they weren't going to get to meet his mommy. Still though, they have managed to make an entire album of song's that were on his mix tape. I, for one, am not going to buy into this blatant attempt to cash in on a hot commodity by adding to this already grossly overhyped movie by paying 12 bucks for this thrown together hodge-podge of music that they obviously made at the drop of a hat to just make even more money off of this movie."
5,One of the best soundtracks made,"This is a great listen. Everything in this is dark and gloomy, which I like, and of course if you're going to have a ""gothic"" soundtrack, you have to include Bauhaus, and this is one of Bauhaus's best tracks. Everything on this is haunting and spooky, like ""She's Unreal"", that song made me feel creeped out for some reason, maybe it was the lyrics, but I love that song too. I didn't like the movie that much, and the clip that came with this CD was just more of the same stuff. This CD is reccomended to anyone who likes dark rock music."
3,"Contrived & overly comercial, but a good collection","In 1994, 3 college students disappeared in a Maryland forset. 5 years later, the country is flooded with commercialism about it.I'm torn with this one. I agree that the mere existance of this disc is crass comercialism at it's absolute worst. Especally considering that more than half of the songs included were released AFTER 1994...the period of time the movie was supposed to happen.Getting past that...it's a good collection of darker material. This is certainly going to be played at a lot of Halloween parties. Personal favs are the Type O Negative track ""Haunted"", Laibach's ""God is God"" (and you thought Ramnstein was something new), Bauhaus and the Creatures. Hey, it's Siouxsie...So yeah....the mere existance of this disc is total crap. But at least they didn't fill it with the usual soundtrack tripe (Bryan Adams, anyone?). Once you get past what the disc is ""supposed"" to be, it's an interesting, odd and well-thought collection. Goth 101."
3,Good tour of '80s & '90s goth that fits the mood of the film,"When is a soundtrack album NOT a soundtrack album? When only one of the songs actually appears in the movie, and even that song--Antonio Cora's ""The Cellar""--is so quiet as to hardly be noticable during the climax of ""The Blair Witch Project."" The songs on this ""soundtrack"" are, in fact, a decent collection of '80s & '90s goth that, oddly enough, fits the mood of the film very well. Any collection that manages to gather Skinny Puppy, Bauhaus & Laibach in one place is well worth owning. The packaging of the CD is worth noting, too: The CD is a facismile of one of the 16mm film cans, the booklet opens to reveal a miniature movie poster--and it comes with a stick-figure tattoo! How cool is that?"
4,More creepy and weid as the movie!,Just as good as the movie and greater then the video. This is so bad it is good. If you like the Movie get the CD. The best part is the new video clip. Beter then the new footage on the on the video! Get POPULA by Digginlilies. IT has Rigors. The only song in the movie. Rigors is not on the CD but you can get Digginlilies POPULA! You can get it on Amazon.com
3,There is only one thing good about this CD,the enhanced version of the CD has a very good part of the film that was unfortuneatly cut from the film now if they had used scenes like this it would have been worth the money to see.
4,Creepy.....very creepy.,"Ok. The movie was ultra-creepy. I just saw it. I know. The website is quite creepy. And this soundtrack (even though it has only one or two selections actually FROM the movie) is yes...creepy, very creepy. All goth bands and coffinrock (hmmm Coffin Rock, that's a place in the movie....) and sound bytes from the film, it delivers the chills even after you have left the movie theater. Long after. Lots of weird songs and sounds here. Perfect for reminiscing or just mood music when you're playing an eerie game like Doom. I personally like this kind of music and am already quite fond of the CD which features the likes of Skinny Puppy, Bauhaus, and Type O Neg. However...If you don't like Gothic music or the movie, you probably shouldn't get this CD. It isn't going to appeal to everyone, so I gave it a 4 out of five. It's a must-have, though for fans of the movie."
2,Was expecting more,"Some of the tracks are good. I'm definitely in love with Meat Beat Manifesto. Also the Laibach song is wikkid. But the other songs really didn't hit me. It dragged on and on. In addition, I wasn't too cool with the audio clips being incorporated into the CD as they were. It would have been cool if some remixes were done to make it smooth. Must say that I was impressed with ""The Cellar,"" but I can't say that about the entire cd."
1,Great Movie!---Poor soundtrack :(,"The Blair Witch Project movie was one of the most exciting, innovative, truly creepy movies ever to be made. In this age of Hollywood slick schlock movies, this movie is refreshing. The soundtrack on the other hand is poor. Except for a couple of tracks, it isn't even a good sample of GOTH music. You are probably best to just enjoy your good memories of the movie--and skip the soundtrack. The soundtrack is just a moneygrab based on the hype of the movie. This soundtrack is about as tuneful as kazoo. If you like dated sounding 80's alternative, then this is the soundtrack for you."
1,Anything to make a buck!,"I won't waste your time or mine.This is lame. It goes to show that everyone is out to make a buck.Should be titled ""Music that they MIGHT have listened to""This CD Has NOTHING to do with the movie...Period. Don't waste your money."
1,Pathetic,"Why make a soundtrack for a movie that has no music? The answer? Money, money, money. It's pathetic. What's the point? I ever personally feel that the movie was stupid. I go in expecting the scaries movie of all time and what do I get? I stare at the ground the entire time and listen to heavy breathing. This movie sure doesn't beat Silence of The Lambs."
3,a myth,The book itself is great. It goes into a lot of the meaning behind the myths. The binding of the book came apart after about 6 weeks. This book was used in a college class and all of the books came apart. The text itself rates 5 stars.
2,Editing,"This book could have been edited better before being published, as I have found several typos, misspelled and misused words in just the first two chapters."
1,Completely Inaccurate Info on Civil Rights Movement,It is surprising that such a distorted view of the FBI's role in the Civil Rights Movement could still be published and taken seriously today. I guess this is not surprising since the book is written by Hoover's right hand man. The book is a total defence of Hoover and his policies. Deloach can see no wrong in anything Hoover did. Deloach is completely wrong headed when it comes to his description of the FBI's role in the Civil Rights Movement. The FBI worked against the Civil Rights Movement and saw it as a threat to the USA. There is no doubt that Hoover was a racist and unfairly targeted Dr. King for espionage and harrassment. That Deloach would still defend the FBI's harrassment of King and still cast doubt on King's honor is a shame to both his legacy and the FBI.
2,The One Sided Story,"If you are a right-wing, ultra conservative member of the Christian Coalition then you will love this book.According to DeLoach the FBI has never done anything wrong, Hoover never kept any secret files, and the sexual innuendos surrounding Hoover were unfounded. This may all be true as I am sure that the tales we hear of Hoover are exaggerated in order to generate interest in the man but it is other comments throughout the book that strike me as proof that the FBI can't and shouldn't police itself.DeLoach discredits anyone who suggests that Hoover was gay but yet uses the same type of proof when detailing Martin Luther King's sexual escapades (why was the FBI investigating and wire-tapping is the better question?), that students in the 60's were wrong in their protest of the US Gov't because it could lead to communism or that homosexualtiy is thrust upon us by the media. He believes in the American way so long as its his American way."
3,"Great bargain, but not build for long lasting","This item was a great bargain. I purchased three of these industrial fans and went back the second day to order a 4th one but the price tripled on me. I was unable to purchase the 4th fan for the price I had purchased the first ones at. Although I made due with what I had. My son and I put the fans together and as long as they were not mobile/moved, they were okay. But when I stored them away for the week I was not using them and put them back out the next week the screws starting falling out and the fan started making noises. Although the fans provide a substantial amount of air quality, the noise can be distracting at times. Let alone trying to keep up with the screws as they fall out. If the stand was built with longer screws this would be a 5 star product, but because of that one mishap it drops it down to 3 star maybe even 2 star because of the noise."
4,NIV Luke Commentary,"This series of commentaries are a good resource for the Bible student. The author writes about the historic meanings and then makes contemporary applications. Occassionally, they are a little on the liberal side, but overall, well reserached and an asset to the student."
2,Save Your Money,"Boasting the fact that it is not only a CD but a DVD and magazine as well seems to be a key marketing tool for this product but ""buyer beware"" as none of them get the proper treatmant. The DVD is packaged in a CD case, the magazine is more or less a CD booklet with a few less-than-informative interviews, and the CD has a lot of dated and pre-released material, most of the tracks clock in at under a minute.The DVD itself doesn't offer much. You get a couple of video clips with 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and Jadakiss but they really aren't doing anything exciting. Snoop is smoking as usual and 50 drops a few funny lines but nothing landmark. It's more or less ""rappers washing their cars"" or playing football with their kids. Pretty boring. I like Whoo Kid's mixtapes but the one included with the DVD was mediocre. Better off getting his ""Hood Radio, Volume 1"" CD."
2,Flapper Costume Review,"This costume was for my teenage daughter for Homecoming Dance - the theme was Roaring 20's. I did pay extra money for faster delivery, and did receive the costume before the dance - but when we opened it up and she held it up, the ""one size fits all"" was HUGE and very thin/see-through! We then folded it up and decided we would send it back. Which is where we are right now - I will be sending this back for a refund. I'm sure it makes for a great costume piece for an adult woman - large size. Perhaps the sizing could have been more accurate."
3,Not a photography bk per se,"This is not a photography book. It's more for mountaineering buffs. But, his photos are included in this book."
2,NOT Reichel at his best,"I'm afraid I cannot sincerely say I enjoyed this CD. I bought this after listening to ""Lower Lurum"", his more recent release which I love. ""S.O.T.R."" cannot hold a candle to ""Lower Lurum"". ""S.O.T.R."" tends to drag on a bit. Each of the many tracks starts out with a clever idea, then takes it nowhere while taking its time about it. The album has its moments, but generally lacks any clear structure, direction, or coherency. In the notes, Reichel states explicitly that the music is essentially just a demonstration of the daxophone, intended to familiarize the musical community with his rather odd invention. The daxophone's full musical, artistic potential is more apparent in Reichel's later work. Get ""Lower Lurum"" instead."
1,totally worthless,"i'm sorry, but this may be the worst med-spanish dictionary ever done. the authors treat the reader as first-graders. i would definitely not recommend this as there are many other books which do a much better job."
5,Nice and Loud,This is a great album to buy if you like your Christian heavy rock music and like to play it with the volume turned up to near ear piercing level.There is a good variety of Bride's songs on this album.Even if your not into Christian music but still like Heavy rock and roll music I urge you to buy this album
3,Grand Piano: Narada Collection,After listening to several Windham Hill collections this one from Narada seems boring and uninspired. Track after track of new age lite.
2,Nothing special,"I'm sure Narada could've come up with a better anniversary album than this.Other than Lanz's ""Summer's Child"" and the tender and romantic ""The shape of her face"" by Michael Whalen there is not much else that is especially memorable.This is a good background music if you play it at a level where you almost can't hear it.Not exactly the reason you buy an album,is it?"
4,Donald Glaude tears it up... but 10X better live.,"Im from the Seattle area, and am lucky enough to see Glaude spin as often as I want to. Hes at virtually every party every weekend here in seattle, and his energy constantly tears up the dance floor with his pumped-up house tracks. Still... this album doesnt do DG enough justice. The sound quality is a little shotty (Moonshine?), and he can do just so much better live. But you say, well he only has one album out?!? WRONG! Tomorrow (June 23, 2001), Glaude comes out with a new album in stores called Mixed Live. I had the opportunity to preview it and its BANGIN. Its one of the best house albums ive ever heard, check that one out if u want to hear what everyone has been talking about when they say Glaude will be the next big international House DJ! Peace."
4,Donald is always off the hook!,I agree that Donald Gluade is one of the most phenominal djs in the world.I just saw him spin at Buzz in D.C. are he tore the roof off.He definetly gets the crowd rollin and rockin.If you ask me I think this cd is one of the best progressive house cds out.So pick the cd up and rock your speakers like he rocks the speakers at the club.
3,A dissapointment,"I'll just echo what has been said already. After seeing DG live, I picked up this album. There is no way he could achieve the intensity of his live shows, but the CD doesn't even come close. Save your money and wait for him to come around. He gets the crowd so worked up it's better to experience him live than listen to a CD that won't really move you."
4,This pretty much includes it all!,"This is an excellent and comprehensive collection of Rozz's art-both written and visual. A DEFINITE must for all fans. The only complaint is that my book fell apart after the first thumb-through-the binding is of very poor quality. However, I am thankful that this book was made as a tribute to Rozz.My only request for future editions (if that ever happens) is to include the lyrics to Spectre."
5,The Amazing Art of Rozz.,"This book is truly an asset for every Rozz Williams admirer. Page to page will send you on a visual (and often surreal) trip through Rozz's mind and out through his eyes, voice and hands. The art is amazing, and there are plenty of pretty'n'twisted collages to feast your eyes onto. This.is.a.VERY.good.book."
3,Drama!,"I started watching this show in its 4th season. The show was filled with drama from the start, it's entertaining."
1,WHERE IS EPISODE 5!!!!!!,"I PURCHASED THE ENTIRE SEASON BEFORE NOTICING EPISODE 5 IS MISSING!!!!WHERE IS EPISODE 5!!!YOU CAN NOT SELL AN INCOMPLETE SEASON!!!!OH HONEY CHILE,HELL NO!!!!!!"
4,Better than I first thought,"When I saw this film I got a little seasick from the hand held camera, and I thought it was a little light diversion. But I found that the characters stayed with me and I kept thinking about it. And months later it is still with me. My son recently asked me if I thought it would work to rent a motel room for 2 and sneak in another person and I just started laughing, and I ordered the DVD for him. It turns out the characters are still with me, and I am extremely fond of this movie."
5,"The best of ""mumblecore""","This is the epitome of everything I wanted from an indie film in the early 2000s: Fun, funny, and quirky while still grounded in a palpable reality. Amongst the so-called ""mumblecore"" genre, this was one of the best (along with Hump Day and Beeswax, in my opinion). Mark Duplass does a great job here on the acting end and his brother Jay does an excellent job with the direction. And the film holds up great. In my opinion, even better than the Brothers' next film, Baghead, which I like a lot."
2,Puffy Chair?,"Why ""The Puffy Chair"" for a title, when the premise was about a relationship doomed to fail. ""The chair"" element adds nothing to the film. Actually They could have made any excuse for a road trip besides the stupid chair. Another thing, why the R rating? Language was a little off color, but that's it. No nudity, some lame violence and a chair on fire. Did I miss something? The female actress was the only factor that kept me watching. I was hoping to see MORE of her. ;) If you like LAME movies you'll enjoy this ....Yawn."
1,Thank you to the one star reviewers,"I made it about fiteen minutes in to this horrendously awful movie before I turned it off. The acting is brutal, the production values non-existent - just utter CRAP! I could randomly pick two of my neighbors out of my building, and would bet you anything that they could act as well as the ""actors"" in the movie within a few days. If someone had a gun to my head and I had to pick whether to watch the rest of this movie or have a few fingernails ripped off with pliers, I would have to think it over for a few minutes - and I'm still not sure which I would choose."
1,OH MY GOD WAS THIS FILM AWFUL,"This is the laziest, most thrown together piece of completely inept filmmaking I've experienced in a long time. The plot is non-existent. The characters are completely contrived at best and just plain annoying at worst. This is really a horrible film. I seriously cannot fathom how people could like this."
5,Complement to Bible study,"This book is part of a series from Concordia Publishing House called, the People's Bible Commentary. It is a fine way to complement daily scripture reading. This author takes several verses at a time and provides additional historical info, helpful explanations and points the reader to his own sin and need for the forgiveness that has been bought by Christ on the cross for you. Thank you Reverend Toppe and CPH!"
5,Well researched,I am rereading this book. It is well researched by Levy to help him explain his experience. It sure saves me a lot of time. And it helps me to explain and the historical context of my experience too. This book is a keeper.
3,Very quirky item,"I just needed an easy way to get pictures off my camera onto my computer. After emails to and from tech support we got this product to work. And for what I need it for it works fine. I have even used it to upload some ringtones to my phone which worked fine as well. There is some tweeking that needs to be done from time to time. (Re-booting usually does the trick.) I paid way too much for mine, but for the price here it is probably a decent value.Haven't tried to do much more with it but may try someday. If you want something simple, or get frustrated easily, find something else."
1,Not worth it.,"What a rip off! You can download updates for 6 months for free. Most people get a new phone in 1-2 years. Guess what? Your new phone will not work with the old software! They will give you a ""promotional"" (read SUCKER) discount that ""allows"" you to purchase the latest versionn that will work with your phone for $27.00. Gee thanks....NOT! Don't waste your money with this company's product."
2,Not well made,The wrap is glued on only on the top of the bokken and gets loose quickly. The wood under the wrap was cracked. Weight and balance was nice but it is not dojo quality. You can do much better for not much more money. This one will sit by the front door for people who ignore the no soliciting sign!
4,Just what I wanted,This is what i wanted to practice with a Katana as you really cant do it safely with a live blade. Strong and sturdy.
2,It broke!,"I received it on time but when I pulled it out of the packaging, it broke! Not very happy but I just taped it up and used it anyway."
1,bad bokken quality and bad packaging,"i baught this bokken from Martial Arts Land, i recieved this bokken in a tight box with little to no protection for the bokken inside.opening the box i find that it was inside a plastic cover and i open that cover to find that the bokken had a crack in the tip and what seem to be a crack near the tsuba of the bokken but at that time i thought it was the way the wood looks cuz some wood have rings but to be sure i put a little super glue on the crack at the tip and ring....the next day i took it outside to practice and immediately after one swing it broke in half..like,i didnt even hit anything and what i thought was a crack near the tsuba was indeed a crack..i warn those who are looking to buy this bokken to look elsewhere and not to buy from the seller mentions at the beginning.."
1,don't buy,I did a soft hit to the ground and it snapped in half. I have used old branches that were covered in moss and a year old that were stronger than this.
4,Nice product,The tsuba was broken but the swords I use do not have tsuba's so it actually worked out well in the end. But 4 stars nonetheless do to a broken piece of the product.
3,"Good, but smells","For me, the most distinct feature of this bokken is that it smells! Once the plastic wrapping came off, I got a whiff of the strong smell that seems to be all over this sword, but mostly on the cord wrapped portion. It smells like fake incense...and it was annoying enough to stink up my closet in a few hours. So beware!As for the bokken itself, it probably isn't strong enough for dueling, but you can probably wack someone with it a couple times. I bought four, so I will say that the wood stain is not equal on all of them; some are darker than others. Some do have imperfections in the wood as well, but for $10 you can't really argue.3.5/5"
4,Yes!,Wooden sword...must I say anymore? The piece of wood itself is not perfect but is a good value for the price. Love it!
3,"Ok for the price, not great quality","I have not used this bokken to strike other bokkens, so I cannot testify to it's strength. But given the quality of the other parts, I wouldn't expect it to hold up. There is a slight curve in the wood, which is not enough to throw off the balance, but disappointing nonetheless. The chord wrapping on the handle was very poorly done - it was very loose, and kept sliding off. The only method used to ensure that the handle wrap stays attached is two lines of gum/residue under each thinner side of the handle. I ended up taking the wrap off and re-wrapping it myself. Finally, the guard is also fairly loose despite the provided rubber ring used to secure it in place. I found superglue to be very helpful in helping fix the above issues.TL;DRWhile this product is fine for practicing forms, I would not recommend it for serious sparring. Expect to make some modifications for comfortable use."
2,"Great music, but poor mastering","I like Christmas music played by a good orchestra, and this music definitely meets my criteria. I enjoy this music.However, while playing the music I heard what sounded like noticeable distortion in several places. After doing several sanity checks to make sure it wasn't just my audio system, I extracted the CD onto my computer and examined the waveforms. The music is clearly limited to -3dB, and zooming in on the areas with disortion I can see the flattened tops of some of the waveforms in the distortion areas. I don't know if the music was clipped at some intermediate stage during mixing/mastering, or if someone just set a hard limiter too agressively, but the end result is very unpleasing to listen to.This distortion isn't noticable in most of the recording (I'm guessing 10-15 seconds total), so if you can ignore those imperfections this is a nice CD. Unfortunately for me, those few seconds of distortion tend to ruin the rest of each track that containing it."
4,catchy pop-punk at its best,This new release from The Goodwill is an excellent album. It features unique vocals and a catchy acoustic track as its closer. It features good riffs and fast paced pop-punk. Fans of NFG and other pop-punk bands will really like this album. The only thing I can see wrong with it is it sounds a little repetitive throughout but otherwise It's definitely worth it.
3,"other, pop-punk band *sign*","Like a lot of other people I heard these guys on mp3.com; I wasn't that impressed, but they were better than a lot of other bands. When mp3.com was shut-down I totally forgot about the goodwill, but then I saw the cd at my local record store, used and marked down to like three bucks, so I picked it up. The goodwill is a pretty good pop-punk band, and if your into stuff like Mest, you will love this cd. For me, if this cd wasn't three dollars I would never be writing this review. The goodwill are one of those bands you listen for a week then forget about."
1,Brian Barbuto needs to go,"I got a demo fo these guys a little over a year ago for a firend who went to hihg school with the lead singer Brian Barbuto. When I first listened to it, I thought ""hey this is pretty good for a little unknown band, but nothing spectacular. I was more inpressed that a kid right out of high school actually got a demo out. then a few months later I hear that this Band The Goodwill, has been touring with the likes of Taking Back Sunday and Yellowcard, and I think to myself this can't be the same band. Unfortunately it was, and what was worse was that the songs on this cd were exactly the same as the stuff on their demow, there was no growth or maturation, and Barbuto's voice is horrible. despite all of those problems, every song sounds the same, there is not variety. damn stupid Goodwill and their lead singer with the horrible voice. Here's some advice, dump Barbuto and get anew singer, you will be sucha better band"
4,Pure joy,"I bought Arnold from a local vendor about three years ago for myself. I'm an adult stuffed pig collector and at the time of the purchase, I was going through a hard time in my life. Arnold was quick to cheer me and has been one of my favorites. He has brought joy to me and many others.Unfortunately, his adorable voice and motions don't last forever. :( After three years of varied use and great care, he stopped working. I changed his batteries and my husband cleaned the battery connectors, but nothing worked.I am very sad about this. I know nothing lasts forever and Gund makes excellent, durable products. Still, I was hoping Arnold would be snoring and talking for many years to come.I can't see myself buying another one because nothing beats the original."
2,Broke after 2 days,"We love our Gunds, but this one broke after 2 days. The ear part doesn't wiggle anymore. Will return. Besides that he is cute and adored by my little pig loving girl."
3,My daughter's pet,"Cute stuffed animal that makes snoring sound and speaks short funny phrase. Good for kids to cuddle, no removal parts."
3,Wow,"Who knew you turn into a whore buy losing your virginity? And who knew that while getting raped, halfway in you like it so much you turn it into love making. Akin would be proud of this movie."
1,Maid In Sweden,"One of those Sleazy softcore latenight poor quality flicks, only plus side is fast forwarding to the good stuff, other than that pure bore and bad quality even on Netflix! Recommended for Pervs, but storyline is boring and I am sure no one watches it for the story but why Softcore? Why not watch Hardcore instead?? :)"
1,RAPE is RAPE,"This was an OK movie until ""16-year-old"" Kristina Lindberg is raped by an older man and the next morning instead of calling the police she tells the rapist that she's ""sorry for being so childish"" . Then she starts dating the guy!!!!! Then before she goes back home, she's raped by her sister's boyfriend!?!? This was billed as a coming of age story and I find it hard to believe this was OK in Sweden, even in 1971. Before you perves who are into rape scenes lay down your money, the rapes, and the movie as a whole, has very little nudity. So take a pass on this movie."
1,consumer product safety commission recall,The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on March 17th issued a recall for Wire-O Bound journals and calendars due to a lead paint hazard.
2,Big Disappointment,"After knowing and loving the records of the ""Vienna Horns"" by heart, I thought it's time to try the London Horn Sound. Maybe I am spoiled, but it was a big disappointment - especially the title Titanic, no depth, no feelings -unbelieveable! If you want to listen to really fantastic horn music, I only can recommend the Vienna Horns' ""Director's Cut"" or ""Vienna Horns"". Sorry Guys!"
3,Its alright,"This CD has some really beautiful playing, but a lot of the selections are cheesy. i.e. Titanic. They might as well have hired Celine Dion to sing along with them. And although there are some real ""wow"" moments like when you listen to Caravan for the first time, (The lead horns sound like the trumpet section in a jazz band), overall, the Cd isn't that exciting to listen to more than once. On the other hand, Take 9 is a CD featuring the American Horn Quartet & The Horns of the NY Philharmonic. Not only do they kill the Londoners with their technique and intonation, but the repertoire better suits the medium than lame pop fantasies. Of note is the orchestral transcription of Overture to Candide. I say transcription because yes, they even play the flute and clarinet solos in the correct octave. TAKE 9 Check it out!"
5,absolutely Inspirational,"This is THE CD I listen to on the way to rehearsal. It truly inspires me to do my absolute best! You've got to love Roman Carnival - so excellent! I would recommend this CD to anyone, especially horn and brass players. These performers are just phenomenal. What else is there to say?"
5,Heaven on Earth,"This CD is incredible. The horn is shown for all it is worth. From the beauty of the ""Titanic"" Fantasy and Hansel and Gretel to the latin Tico-Tico, jazz of Ellington in Caravan and the incredible rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody, the horn proves it is not as limited an instrument as some may think. Both the high and low ends of the horn are highlighted. Simply heavenly. If you like horn playing at all or even if you don't, you will want to give this CD a listen. It is well worth your time and money."
5,"""Young at Heart"" by Rachelle Zuckerman, Ph. D.","I've always felt young at heart even after turning 52..but never knew the ins and out of finding and keeping romance. Tom Blake recommended I read, ""Young at Heart."" This book is Great! I've read it once, twice, and now again so that the messages become ingrained and spontanious.I can't beleive how nieve and stupid I've been about my relationships with men. So many errors and mistakes. If you're a single, divorced or widow woman approaching 50 or 50+ you've gotta read this book! Keep it near your nite table for review. Dr. Zukerman Thanks a million for writing a book that women ""redating again for the first time can truely use!"" ""This book gets a 10+ from me."""
5,A Wonderful Collection,"Bret Johnston's debut collection of short stories is an excellent, powerful book. Such talent, compassion and insight coming from such a young writer is extraordinary. Johnston knows his craft, and ""Corpus Christi: Stories"" is beautifully written."
3,Well-Written,"The book was well-written and read quickly, but the stories themselves were a bit on the depressing side, and many had the same theme: man and woman meet, fall in love, have kid, kid dies, relationship goes down the crapper."
4,Elevating the ordinary to something extraordinary,"If you like visual journal type of books like ""Drawing From Life"" you will probably enjoy this. It is a nice sized book with a great textural cover. It seems like a lot of thought was put into the printing of this book and the feel of the paper to the reader's touch.Will you learn any art techniques from this? Nope...not that kind of book.There are interesting visual experiments, a funny personal collection of name misspellings and several other text and/or visual anecdotes of every day life.I liked ""Drawing from Life"" just a bit better because I felt more of a connection with the contributors since the commonality was the obvious journal. This book does not have that same connection for me but I still enjoy it simply as a lover of a visual feast."
4,Good book,"I am very pleased with this product. The quantity for the price was very fair, and the packaging was nice as well. Thank you"
3,Kind of Boring,"The Townsends would NEVER sink so low as to sell Wonder's first foal. Maybe Brad, but not Townsend Sr. I mean seriously, they must have seen that he had the most potential on the farm. Kind of scattered. The townsends will really get on your nerves after this."
3,not as good as the first,"i have read the first 7 books, and loved the first 4, i am still reading them over and over, i found the books where Sammy came in a bit dull and repetitive of the first four over all it was still pretty interesting"
5,graet book! one of the best!,"i loved it!pride,wonder,ashliegh,and samantha.what more could you ask for?a great match.all in all,a wonderful book!"
5,Exceptional,Really a nice collection of designs from the 50s era of home building.Check it out you will like them.
1,Only got to use once,Had to exchange first coat as the arms ran small for coat size.Second coat (larger size) fit good and was happy at first. Exactly what I wanted.I work outdoors and got to use the coat in the rain once. Coat was in good shape when I put it up to dry. A few days later I got it out of my truck to use and the plastic was cracked/torn everywhere. Like it was dry rotted or something. (see photo of blue coat above) I would send back but it cost me $9 to send the first one back. So I would have more invested in postage than the coat is worth. First thing I ordered on-line that I am unhappy with.Very disappointed.
4,yellow coat with strong chemical smell,"coat was as described, though it has a very powerful chemical smell to it. Even after sitting outside for a week, the chemical smell is still very strong. coat fits well; good for multiple layers, it is also very long, the large size i got goes halfway down my shin, and iam 5'5. coat is a nice yellow color, bright but not to the point of being shocking."
1,Poor performance,"Fit was great, but after a very few wearings I noticed cracks in the jacket along the legs. More cracks appeared within a week. I finally threw it away. If you want a jacket to last more than a month, do not buy this one."
1,rips easily,"the buttons on the front connect to snaps, which are only held onto the coat by a very flimsy thin fabric which is glued, not sewn, on - so flimsy that just opening the package ripped off the top connector. BOO!"
5,One of the first Southern rap albums,"I got hip to Southern rap long before MTV thought about playing a Master P video. C-Loc was (and may still be) the local boy representing Baton Rouge, LA. ""Who's Gonna Ride"" is a serious song about the artist's possible death and his desire to know just who will ride for him (make sure the killer gets croaked). It's powerful. The whole album is increadable, with several tracks that hit uncontrolably hard in the club. Get this and know that Nelly ain't sh8t."
5,Overlooked Superb Initial Album of a Rising Talent,"Michael Gettel provides highly original music which lightens the heart, often races the pulse and sometimes, just sometimes, has enough unique beauty to bring tears to the eyes. My first encounter was in the early 1990's with ""The Key"" and have since acquired all his albums. My last to get is ""Return"" - his first. I highly recommend this overlooked album because it clearly displays his incredible talent, from the get-go, to create and perform powerful original compositions. Especially inspiring is the song ""Avalon Rising"" which can be downloaded for a mere 99 cents. Give it a spin and see what I mean."
4,Great book to refer for the names and specifications of tropical fishes,W&#304;th the support of the pictures this book is helpful to learn the names of the fishes. Good quality and good price as well.
5,Great ID book,"This book is great! It uses full color photos and even has tips to help distinguish between similar fish. It is rather big and may be difficult to travel with, but has tons of great information."
4,One of the best out there!,"This book revolutionised fish ID in the tropical South Pacific when it first came out. We live and work in Fiji in the marine environment and have 4 of these on our shelf (for use of staff in the field as well as office)The only drawback we find is the bizarre choice of common names. There are already a plethora of other books out there with common names fairly well established in Fiji by Lieske&Meyers.; Seems to follow more of an Australian theme for these than the prevous Paul Humman books which use the American common names.But overal a MUST for any diver who visits the Tropical Pacific. If you use it in conjunction with Lieske&Meyers; then if you don;t find the fish you're looking at, prepare to be published!"
3,Reef Fish Identification for the fish watcher,"I am a fish watcher, which is to say that I keep careful track of the species of fish that I see on my trips. My wife and I are headed to Bali for a month. This guide was recommended to us. Reef fish of the Tropical Pacific pictures lots of species and covers a very large area. The pictures are fairly good for the purposes of identification. The ranges given for the fish are fairly helpful, but we find it difficult to interpret exactly when a species might occur in our area. Distribution maps would be an improvement. Having said that, this guide may be about the best available for areas of the tropical Pacific for which a specific guide does not exist. jeff"
3,Too much information?,"Although this book is everything you would expect, it actually was too much information (if that is possible). We were looking specifically for fish i.d. for Hawaii. This book covers such a larger area that it was difficult to find just the fish of Hawaii, so we opted to also purchase a book specific to Hawaii fish. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book, it is thorough and complete, just not what WE were looking for.If you want to know the fish of the entire tropical Pacific then this IS the book for you."
4,GREAT RESOURCE BUT COULD USE UPGRADES,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY DIVER. HOWEVER SOME OF THE PICTURES ARE RATHER POOR QUALITY AND COULD USE AN UPGRADE. THE BOOK IS A MONEMENTAL ACHIEVMENT BY THE AUTHORS
5,Enlightening Read into the Retail Industry!,"This has been a most gratifying read...only just finished reading all the valuable insights into how retailers have been reinventing themselves in the tight marketplaces and carved strong niches for themselves with the detailed database knowledge accrued from their existing and would-be customers. Amazing the lengths to which companies, especially the SMEs, go to garner a strong fellowship of loyal customer base."
5,GPSW system,For the money this system is excellent. It performed well from the start. While it is easy to set up I have to learn some of the details for storing data and using it. Shipped quickly and accurately from the vendor.
1,Just ok,I purchased this product for a trip to North Carolina. It does ok for a straight shot to somewhere. One BIG problem is the fastest route it gave me was to go straight thru Baltimore and Washington. Not the beltway around each but straight thru. Your best bet with this unit is to have a map and know where you are going first then you can choose a better way in spots that are not straight to the point. The best route on these is not the best route. For some small run arounds in NC it worked well
3,a Navigon,"Trying to help the decision making process of my friend's wife, I revisited my experiences with this product. I think my biggest problem with this product was that I picked it up rather late in it and consumer gps development relative to its cost and features."
3,Good and bad points,"This is my second GPS. What I'm pleased with is that it ALWAYS seems to get a signal. It even gets one near a window in the house. It's fastest route is based on road speed limit compared to distance. You may go a long way quickly but get there faster going a shorter route. I'm also on my second power cable. I don't know why they fail but I end up twisting them ""till they work"", and that's just NOT cool. I like mine but I'm SURE the new models have more and better tools."
2,"Long term customer, Bought new, Shipped used with parts missing","I have been a Prime Amazon customer for years and just bought the Delphi for my husband trying to sell him on buying from Amazon. The Delphi came in a box that was pushed in, packaging was on top not on sides which is where it was pushed in. The internal box was open, the bracket was missing the screen had fingerprints on it and it appeared used. Wow, what a disappointment. He was wanting to use it this week too and I said Oh Amazon will get it here and it will be great. I was wrong. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH PRODUCT AND DELIVERY."
1,Worst Navigation I've Used,"I had this for 2 days. Lets just say, if you have slightly bad eyes, I would not reccomend this for you for the small text they have. Also, the map colors are the worst that you have to move your head up closer to the unit to be able to focus clearly. The verbal navigation stopped working on mine after 2 days and it just kept saying new route in the corner and customer service could not help me at all. When you see a POI on the screen, you can not read what it is cause they picked a color that is very hard to see so there is no way possible you can read it. I'm only 19 with good vision too."
2,Limited Capabilities,"I bought this phone for my home office because my 2.4GH phone interferes with my wireless network. The good news is this phone improved that issue. If you are operating this phone in the same room all of the time and you don't care about voice quality this phone may be adequate for you. When I move downstairs the phone could not get a good enough signal. My previous phone was a (several years old) 2.4GH Panasonic, I could get great reception anywhere in my home and even in my yard. I have now replaced the VTech with a Panasonic KX-TG6021M 5.8 GHz Cordless Telephone, so far I am very pleased with the new phone."
4,Reliable Phone,Just as the title says this is a reliable phone for very low cost. Who could ask for more?
3,Hmmm,"Not the best phone I have ever had, but works. It is a little scratchy but I know when people are calling. I will look for another phone after this one."
3,Reasonable Value,"Reasonably good value; works fine most of the time. The reception seems to be not as good as the transmission of sound, thus we cannot hear as well as the people at the other end."
1,Terrible voice sound quality.,"Like another reviewer, I bought the 5823 to replace my old Vtech 2426 -- which I've had for over eight years and am only replacing it now because the keypad is finally wearing out. But the brand-new, 5.8 GHz thing sounded terrible! So I'm returning it and searching for another 2426.Incidentally, for those who have a problem with the battery in the 2426, my experience was that the battery that originally came with the phone lasted for at least five years, maybe longer. At some point it would hardly hold a charge anymore -- so I bought a new battery. About $5 later -- ta da! Battery was fine again. This was a couple of years ago, and the new battery is holding just fine."
1,This grinder sucks!!,"Was just looking for an inexpensive grinder for the workshop. Bought this Neiko grinder as i wanted an 8"". Wow, the wheels were so unbalanced it vibrated like a SOB. It vibrated so bad the light bulbs would burn out in seconds as it would kill the filament. I dissaembled it hoping i could take care of the issue and not have to go through the return BS. But after i relized what i cheap chinese pice of junk it was, i decided my hard working American money was not deserving of this grinder.I boxed it up and requested a RMA#. This purchase really made me re-evaluate buying stuff online you cant touch and feel and see in person to evaluate. Very disgusted."
3,It's a guy thing...,"It seemed like a prescription for enjoyment. The main character and I are the same age, have lived and travelled in some of the same places, and were even at the University of Oregon at the same time. I also write all the time though I don't have a burning passion to publish.Did I like the book? It was only OK. I appreciated the short chapters that took me into other spaces at lunch hour. But, it was a familiar whimper without any breakthrough thoughts for me. California angst. Middle-aged angst. Writer's angst. Self-help angst.Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm was due to my gender. For a woman it's interesting to be inside the mind of a guy, but in this case I was happy when the well-written denouement finally came and I closed this book. I would rather be rereading Arthur Rosenfeld (!!!) or Craig Carozzi for male points of view.Sutton should keep writing; he has a lot to say to some people. I'm just not on his wavelength."
3,"Nice, but...","Nice, but I am some disapointed. I got this based a lot on other reviews, and was let down. Just not my taste, I guess."
5,Satori-Music for Yoga and Meditation,"The sound is open and spacious, highly evocative and emotionally complex.If what you'll looking for is a delicate sensitivity,the warmth of wood, withoutwestern music structure or pulse, you'll enjoy this cd."
3,An interesting idea,"Welcome to the world of Cassandra French, twentysomething lawyer in business affairs for a major film studio. Between dodging calls fom her under house arrest mother and dealing with a distinct lack of meaningful work at work, Cassandra also juggles the needs of her three boys.Is Cassandra a single mother? Oh, no. Cassandra runs an elite school for boys in need of correction in her unfinished basement. And there's a brand new student...hot young actor Jason Kelly.Enough with the fluff. ""Cassandra French's Finishing School for Boys"" is a quirky, satire of a novel. Be warned there are some dark moments with interesting outcomes. The cover may look like a chick lit novel doodled on by a bored teenager but inside is a quick moving tale that spoofs Hollywood actors, dating, pet owners who think Fluffy can do no wrong and the legal system."
2,"1 star for concept, can't give 0 for content","I am very glad that I checked this book out at my local library. The girl at that counter told me it was a funny take on chick-lit. Boy was I surprised. There was nothing funny about this book. I didn't even read the whole thing; I just wanted to know if Cassie bear got caught so I skipped to the end. There was nothing believable about this book. How did this small woman contain grown men for months? I found the characters annoying, even the normal Stuart got on my nerves. I like dark comedy when done right. This was not. This book would make a much better movie, less drawn out, but will all the plot twists."
1,Wasn't worth finishing,"I did the same thing as many other people: started reading it, didn't like it, and skipped to the end, hoping for an outcome I didn't find.I don't often give books up without finishing them. This was one of the few.Oh, one another thing, the book jacket, which I didn't read before picking up the book, describes Cassandra as ""endearingly amoral."" For me, those just aren't two words that go together.If you like characters who behave selfishly with no consequences, this book is for you.And as for the laughs? I read about 150 pages before I skipped to the end. I didn't laugh once. Not in my head, and not out loud, either."
2,Pissed me off and not in a good way,"My friend made me read this book since she wanted someone else to suffer and have someone to discuss the absolute whacked stuff that happens in this book. I will admit that the book is well written, but I did not like any characters in the book and was completely unsatisfied with the ending. Cassandra French isn't an anti-chick heroine but a freaking nut case who deserves to be put away for life. She hears her freaking dead dad in her head and doesn't think it's weird at all. Come on! Cassandra is annoying, her friends are annoying, and there are no basements in Southern California to keep any ""boys"" in!"
1,cass french finishing school for boys,"This is the most disgusting book i have ever had the misfortuneto read.I couldnt finish it,because i wanted to vomit.Bookcover completely misleading,definitely not hilarious or funny.Should only be sold in porn bookshops or those for thecranky. I brought my book back to the bookshop and got a refund.Dirty and creepy and twisted.I feel sorry for you,america !"
4,Funny and surprising,"This book was thoroughly odd and enjoyable. It tracks the progress of Cassandra French, a bored Hollywood lawyer whose dead father's voice urges her to reform the ill-behaved men around her. Accordingly, she locks 3 men up in her basement with manacles and handcuffs. She gives them fashion tips and shows them movies featuring kind treatment of women.Everything goes awry when Cassandra gets mixed up with an actor, Jason Kelly, who's suing her place of employment. Jason is so slick and disrespectful of women that Cassandra drafts him into her school, but he's not as cooperative of the others.The book definitely has a dark streak, as demonstrated by the S&M; gadgets Cassandra uses to restrain and control the men, but it is funny as well. I didn't think the ending went as far as it could have, and was in fact kind of timid. Still, this was an interesting and different reading experience."
5,nonrevisionist history,"Too many accounts of history are written by those who live in ivory towers and sit in comfortable chairs. A. S. experienced the Russia of which he wrote. He documents what the reigns of communist premiers from 1918 to 1956 (especially Lenin's and Stalin's) were really like: terror, perverted logic, unjust sentences, and at least 20 million Russians executed, starved to death, or sentenced to the Gulag.The author's style is unique; some of his sentences are the length of a long paragraph but one is able to follow them to their and his conclusion. And he offers many conclusions as he details trials sentencing innocent victims to the frozen wasteland from which few returned.This book so shook me that I could not read anything else by A. S. for 15 years."
4,Great introduction,"As a cardiologist with an interest in vascular imaging, this was a very good introduction. I appreciated the colloquial style and illustrations. The only critisism would be the absence of any mention of variations caused by vascular pathology"
4,Excellent however there is a But,"Superb resource and I would agree with Don's own self review except for my two nits: First, it needs a better binding than the horrendous glue job that the Davies' printer provides. The pages fall out quickly. Second, we need an update edition which rearranges the illustrations and plates to be more useful. This would be an enormous improvement for learning and using the text ""on the job"". Perhaps, if it was printed with a quality ring-type (or smyth-sewn) binding with more color plates and illustrations that are facing on opposite pages to the relevant text when opened flat, then both of my requests for improving this great resource for vascular technologists would be met."
4,Good book.,Great way to start learning about vascular scanning. Book was in new condition and its very informative.
3,"Plot happens, characters stay the same","The title sums it up for me. Events happen to these characters, but they emerge from the book exactly the same as they were before.I did like the characters, who were sweet and refreshingly normal for a romance novel, but it seemed they fell in love out of proximity. There was no sense of them completing each other or being drawn together out of unmet needs the other could fill. Perhaps it was because the hero was already in love with the heroine when the book started, but I saw no reason for them to be in love."
5,Gut wrenching and gripping.,"This is a thorough description, by one of the main investigators, of the 1983 murders of 11-year-old Ricky Stetson, 13-year-old Danny Joe Eberle, and 12-year-old Chris Walden by John Joubert in Bellvue, Nebraska."
4,atmospheric but involving,"This new one by Osby has more shape and focus than ""Banned in New York"" which was more a collection of good moments than strong versions of the tunes. Though Osby is not strongly represented as a composer, his stamp is unmistakably on the material. His alto sound and arrangements unify the proceedings. The addition of Andrew Hill here, particularly, is of note. The same atmospheric, elliptical feel one finds in Hill's own work infuses this material (two of the compositions are his). The album's best moments are the duets by Osby and Hill, ""The Watcher"" and ""The Watcher 2"". Only the mushy sounding guitar on the head of ""Nature Boy"" (check out either of Coltrane's versions of this tune to hear definitive versions) is a noteworthy misstep. A contemporary, legitimate jazz album which sounds interesting and up to the minute without being arduous to listen to."
4,refreshing,"This is a very enjoyable cd. New material with a great appreciation of motown and funk, with a euro groove. Will definitely put a smile on your face and a nod to your neck."
5,Nicole Willis & Her Brood Are A Pleasure To Behold,"To hell with anybody who'd review this disc less than a five, listen to it twice and I think you will agree, Nicoles vocals are those of the underdog. She perfectly scores the neosoul soundtrack that you wish would accompany your life in a biopic. The arrangements are lush and funky, and Nicole baby, you are sweet as honey!!!"
2,"Promising music, ruined by the vocals","This was recommended to me by a store clerk when I picked up the latest album by the Budos Band,The Budos Band II. Open to trying something new, I picked it up. The instrumentals started out promising, but Nicole's vocals -- up front and largely unadorned -- must be an acquired taste. Uncertain, often off-pitch, occasionally shrieking (as in the title track), they made it impossible for me to love this album. And the lyrics! ""He's my four-leaf clover / Lucky that he walked over"" and ""He's my baby / No, I don't mean maybe"". I'm sorry, but lyrics that sound like they're straight out of a 7th-grade rhyming dictionary just don't do it for me. So, I have to pass on this one."
3,Nice little track,"After Mario's hit remake ""Just a Friend"" in 2002, he's been written off as a one-hit wonder - until now. Mega-hit ""Let Me Love You"" is a nice little song from a fairly talented young artist. You can tell Mario's voice has been played with a bit on this track, but it's still a nice, if forgettable, little song."
3,Somewhat misty,"It's not a bad new age cd, though much of it doesn't stand out as being particularly original. The more ""exotic"" pieces, tracks 1,2 and 3, are nice but have a very polished feel. It's too obvious that the artist was trying to convey a deep, rich, mystical experience. Among all my ambient cd's, I don't find myself pulling this one out hardly at all, even though the music on it is nice. Perhaps if this were the very first new age cd I ever heard I would have been more impressed."
1,Arrived Incomplete!!!!,"I was very excited to make lamps for Christmas gifts. The order arrived over a week ago, but I just now took a look at it and it came without the important cork! I will probably be able to makeshift something out of it, but items should arrive complete and I see that I'm not the first person to have experience this. Will never work with this company again!"
2,It's a great idea but didn't work for me,I saw this idea in a magazine was so excited to make a personal lamp for a gift. But the cord just hung down awkwardly and the whole thing was wobbly. I had high hopes and it was a bit of a disappointment.
3,lamp kit,This lamp kit is of great quality but did not fit the wine jug I wanted to use it for. The cork insert was just too small to fit the bottle opening. I am wondering if it would fit any wine jug opening perfectly as it is quite small. I did manage to use it by using some filler around the cork itself but would have preferred it the insert had fit without help.
3,"Good idea, not amazing execution",I agree with the previous rating that the chord is a bit awkward. I had to drill a hole into the bottle and jimmy rig it so that the chord wasn't so cumbersome.
2,incomplete,"It is a great idea; however, a base for the bottle is needed or it will all fall over. So far, I haven't been able to find one."
2,Wine Bottle Lamp Kit (Set of 2),"Although the inintial shipment was recieved within a few business days, one of the products was missing parts rendering it unable to use. Howver, when I phoned the company -they shipped out the missing parts. All in all -I am quite happy with the product. Although it was not shipped Ready-to-use as expected.Then with the additonal shipment required and time it took to get all part(s) it was rather an annoyance."
4,I only wish that they have a clip also,"Not everyone wears jeans all the time to attach the velcro piece to.I love this case and recommend it to anyone with a 5G iPod, (5.5G iPod-ders Beware! IT won't fit!)I wish that it had extendable sides or was able to be smaller to accomadate other iPods, but I suppose that's how they make their money."
2,Integrate three volume to one,"I feel that the writing style is a little confusing even though Jensen is a master. I also recommend to integrate the three volume to one due to the simplicity and vol. 2 just took 182 pages. In addition, the notations relatively differ from the ones in Peterson's Petri nets."
2,Integrate three volume to one,"I feel that the writing style is a little confusing even though Jensen is a master. I also recommend to integrate the three volumes to one due to the simplicity and vol. 2 just took 182 pages. In addition, the notations relatively differ from the ones in Peterson's Petri nets."
4,Several story lines.,"I've read a few of Sharyn McCrumb's novels, and I've liked this one, She Walks These Hills, the best. There are a few story lines going here--one is about an escaped convict with a brain disorder caused by alcohol. He's been in prison for 30 years and is looking for his family as they were 30 years ago.Another is of a grad student trying to trace the route of a young woman kidnapped by Indians in the distant past. A third is about a woman who wants to become a deputy in the local sheriff's office, after having been the dispatcher. Her boyfriend, a deputy from the same office, does not like the idea, but the woman wants to better herself. The sheriff must decide whether to give her a chance.Still another story line is about a radio disc jockey who has a phone-in talk show,and who is intrigued by the elderly convict and the reason he was sent to prison. All their stories intersect, and it makes for a very interesting read."
5,Appalachian Revisionism,"This novel makes such a strong statement about the destruction of a culture and its environment through the use of mystery, suspense and well-drawn characters. It also questions conventional perceptions of heroes and villains and thus revises the myths that the author is drawing on. That's what makes it so brilliant. She Walks These Hills in the best book I've ever seen from Sharyn McCrumb. I am in awe of her achievement."
5,Sharyn McCrub,"Any book that Sharyn McCrumb writes is going to be an excellent read. Grab a cuppa ""joe"" or tea, put your feet up and enjoy! Just be sure you have plenty of time because once you start, you are going to want to finish at one reading. My Grandmother was gifted with ""The Sight"" and my mother is also gifted with ""The Sight"" and so I always enjoy the books that include ""Rattler"" and ""Nora""."
5,I'm hooked,"In the past few years I'd given up on reading mystery novels. Then someone handed my this book. With fully-realized characters, an interesting plot and a fascinating historical background, I just couln't put this book down. Then I bought ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" and thoroughly enjoyed that - and I just ordered ""The Rosewood Casket"" - I'm definitely hooked on her ""Ballad"" series."
5,"A book for anyone who loves history, mystery ,and suspense","Sharyn McCrumb is, as usual, a goosebump experience. Her novels set in the Great Smokies, are so atmospheric, you can get lost in the fog. I only wish she could write as fast as we devour her books!"
5,Great service but could't read the small print.,"I received the book quickly and it was in good shape as described; however, I can't read small print. I thought it was going to be in large print."
4,Engrossing and thought provoking.,"This was a good read. I have one small nit to pick: in Chapter 2, Mrs. Pentland says, ""He went to prison in 1968. I was twenty-eight then..."" Two pages later Sheriff Spencer says, "" It's been twenty-five years since Harm Sorley went to prison, and his pretty young wife[now Mrs. Pentland] has become an old lady he wouldn't even recoginze."" And later, she is referred to as ""a woman in her sixties."" Well, in my math class 28 + 25 = 53!! And that is NOT and ""old lady""! Inconsistencies like these are distracting. Good authors like McCrumb deserve better editors!!!!"
2,"Story line seemed contrived, characters were not engaging","I have a hard time believing I read the same book as the other reviewers. Although it was a mildly entertaining 2-hour read, I found the story line contrived, the characters hopelessly cliche, and the ending an anticlimactic let down. The resolution of the story's loose ends was just a bit too neat, and the end result left me with a hollow, wasted feeling. Save your money and wait for the Lifetime movie on cable-- Cold Mountain is a much better bet."
5,One the best works of historical fiction,"Despite its turgid title, ""She Walks These Hills"" is as captivating as Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude."" I was hooked from page one. McCrumb's thorough research and well-drawn characters populate an Appalachian journey in which the events of two centuries are intertwined. I first read this book more than 15 years ago and keep going back to it. Also recommend McCrumb's ""The Rosewood Casket"" and ""St. Dale."""
5,Great service!,Simple purchase of a simple product with great service and fair price. I'd do business with this vendor again. A++
4,Great book,"While I agree with a previous reviewer that there are some instances in which a quote is clearly taken out of context, the overall thematic elements in the book show a true consistancy: Prior to the early 1930's no Christian Church accepted contraception.One must ask then, regardless if they are Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant, did the Christian Church, for 2000 years get it wrong? Are we only now 'discovering' truth in the Bible?Or perhaps being 2000 years removed from the time of Christ, it is those who embrace the culture of death that have it wrong.Look up the very first command that God gave to man in the book of Genesis directly after mans creation. I'll share it with you here: ""Be fruitful"". Now find in scripture where it states that God's command to be fruitful is fulfilled or superceded by another command. There is none.http://www.flyfreeministries.org/forum/ http://phorum.phatmass.com"
5,Small cute and good quality,It has only been a few days but I liked the fit and finish. Nice sound to it when the blade hits the wood. So far I am happy. Will update this review if I find any issues..
5,Great Fun!,"This is an excellent book for fun, learning and just great family times. Some of the ideas are more complex then others so the activities you choose depend on your time and how much you want to get involved at that time.For every activity it lists all you need and complete directions which are really detailed for that activity.The resources are wonderful! It list magazines, books, websites, organizations which are related to each topic and just branches out the fun and learning.This was a nice book to keep around for further reference. Great to have on hand!"
4,"365 Activities for Fitness, Food and Fun for the Whole Family","This book was purchased to be placed in a Silent Auction basket for a school fundraiser. The book inspired the theme. All donations for the basket were related to healthy living. Items such as jump ropes, flying discs, bike gear, etc. were included with the book to supplement the book. I did not read the book myself, but I did look through a few activities and I think families would thoroughly enjoy having this book handy when trying to think of creative activities to do together."
2,Steering Problems,What can i say ...The parts i ordered did not arrive the first time.Parts were resent and i received them and amazon refunded my money because the company was not taking care of it.Way To Go Amazon.When i received the parts one was the right one and the other did not fit.Emailed the Company and they said they needed information and not i have 1 part i can not use and have not heard from them since ...Amazon receives a five star rating*****Mowtown receives 2 stars ....
5,Great Product Fits well highly recomend for 250r's,"Awesome fit, great great shipping. I highly recomend for all 250r's looks great on my bike. i had doubts when purchasing this but luckily the quality, look, and functionality of this product exeeded my expectations.thanks,"
2,"On Target, is off target.","Shima presents good insights and interesting ideas. However, the video does not provide enough concrete and useful instruction. Way too much time is spent by shooters he has trained giving testimonials about how much they learned from him. Seems like you need to take his lessons, you sure can't improve your shooting from simply watching this video. p.s. I read a review like this before I bought the video. I did not believe that review. I wish I had saved my money."
2,Dissapointed,After reading other reviews and knowing what kind of shooter the author is I was expecting a self help video with some tried and true fixes for shooting problems. The video does gloss over a few techniques however it's mostly interviews of shooters that have taken Shima's classes and how much they learned at those classes. I wish I had saved the money for the video so I could afford to go to one of his classes.
2,Stay on Target with John Shima,The least informative DVD on skeet shooting I have ever viewed. Almost as boring as Todd Bender's DVDs.
2,Totally NOT worth it,Being a BIG lover of Gigers work I couldnt wait to see what he had to say and what sort of thing could be packed onto a C.D. This DVD is just a money spinner for the giger fund I think. Dont waste youre money..........buy one of his books instead.....GUTTED!
4,Big Readable Paperweight,"Television has always played a major role in the recent history of the Olympic Games. What alot of people don't realise is that the first television broadcast of this event was the infamous 1936 Berlin Games albeit via a closed circut network within the surrounding areas of the venues. The 1936 games were also the where the first lighting of the Olympic Flame began.This is where Nigel Blundell picks up with the torch with a quick history of the games (politics, tragedy, drugs etc...)and a very comprehensve history of the results, medals etc with an overview of the stars of the games.This book was printed before the XXVII Olympiad, 2000 Sydney Games but as it was intended as a complement to them, the venues and Sydney it'self are included in this large and rather heavy to hold and well illistrated book."
3,Ok - but I wanted higher power,They're cheap and you get what you pay for - I preferred using a 10X lens that I bought.
5,This charger rescued all my AA batteries,"I have 12 AA Energizer rechargeable batteries. After using for more than 3 years on camera and other devices, all of them were dying. For the past 3 years, I recharged them by using Energizer charger in 15 minutes, they could last only for 10-20 shots on Canon digital camera. After I read reviews of this product, I would like to give it a try. After analyzing all of the dying batteries, some of them were even below 100 mAh(the full capacity is 2200 mAh, some are 2300 mAh), but after following the simple instructions, I rescued all of my batteries, all of them are above 1800 mAh (with one exception -- 1460 mAh) some even close to 2000 mAh. For more than 3-year-old batteries, I am very satified with the results.Also, in the manual, there are some important knowledge regarding battery recharge. If you have some dying batteries, this product is the perfect rescuer for you."
3,No good for AAA's,"Since there are so many other long reviews, I will keep this short and note one significant shortcoming.First, all functions seems to work as expected with AA's (double A).But this exotic ""smart"" charger is not smart enough to know when AAA (triple A) cells are being used. As a result it rejects many good AAA's as bad and refuses to charge them.So rather than prolonging the life of AAA's, it deems them un-chargeable (hence unusable) long before they have died a natural death.Even a cheap AAA charger may be better for getting full life cycle from AAA's."
3,Many options,I had hoped this giant beast would revive and recondition some older batteries I have. Most were revived. However most of those held so little juice I ended up tossing them anyway. Using Eneloop now. Still use the old Maha quick charger I have most of the time. Think I'll only use this once a year or so to condition the batteries. Not sure I really needed this after all.
2,"Great for AA, but not AAA batteries","Got this charger about a month ago and used it for AA batteries the first month. Now we have been trying various AAA rechargeable batteries in it, with no luck. It still works fine on AA batteries, but using AAA batteries of the same age and brand does not work. It is a great charger if you only want to charge AA batteries, so I gave it 2 stars instead of only one star. But for me, this is going back and I will get a different charger that can handle both battery sizes."
4,When Fresh Batteries Are Crucial,"I'm glad I got this charger! I use it to recharge my batteries, but the best function is that it can tell me which ones are going bad. I love the lcd display that tells how much capacity each battery currently has and how much charge it holds. Reliable equipment is key to by business - I'm a pro photographer so having freshly charged batteries is critical to my daily work. The Maha Powerex MH-C900 ensures that I have good sets of fully charged batteries at all times. A+"
5,The Rolls Royce of chargers!,"This widget is a nerd dream for a battery charger!An ordinarily boring device with maybe an LED or two, is completely transformed by Maha. No primitive bar-graphs, you get numbers. You get programs to cycle and recondition the batteries. Simply awesome, several sets of batteries I thought were headed for the recycler were made nearly-new by the reconditioning capability of this charger.As a serious geek, I looked past the JUNK they give you with the LaCross like a travel bag and some mediocre batteries. They are to make up for product deficiencies. You get a LaCrosse maybe it will melt into a plastic lump someday or refuse to charge batteries that the Maha will.You want the best, get this one, you won't regret it!"
2,dying after 2 years,"i bought 2 of these chargers...when they were new...they worked great... however...i'm no longer of that opinion... i'm a very light user...maybe once a month...which means...in the last 2 years...these charger have hardly been used...imho... first, the prongs started to lose their connectivity and grip... now...2 slots won't charge... first 1 charger went...now the second is exhibiting the same problems... i have one at home and one at work...so...i doubt it's a power problem... anyway...i no longer recommend this product because of it's lack of longevity..."
3,Good in general but has risky moments,"I recieved this item one week ago and so far charged about 23 AAs and AAAs.One of the cheaper AAA NiMHs I charged overheated so badly that I could not get it out of the charger without using a screwdriver to pry it out. A melted part of that battery is still in that charger AAA slot, fused to the plastic. The charger still works fine but what is going on?06.05.2009 - Time for an update. The hot battery issue hasn't repeated itself. The battery bay where it happened doesn't work quite as well for certain batteries, but generally I don't notice or remember the issue. Overall I just love the Maha charger. I've been using it since the incident for an average of 4-8 batteries a week, and it just does it's thing. I'm going to see if I can raise my original rating to 5 stars.I love being able to set my charge rates and see what each battery takes and holds. And it has worked 100 % ok since the original meltdown, with no recurrence of that issue."
2,doesnt charge properly,"I dont know if I have a defective unit but when I charge AA batteries it only charges to a very small fraction of the batteries full capacity. Batteries that charge up to 2400mah with other chargers only charge to 150mah on MH-C9000. The other functions work properly and it does refreshing, breaking in and discharging batteries but I cant get it to charge batteries to a decent capacity. I dont think its faulty batteries because it does it with all of the ones I have, new or old. Energizer 2450 and 2300mah, EcoTrends 2300, Duracell 2000, Panasonic 2300 all charge to 20-230mah. IT did a nice job of reviving the Panasonics I have though. I have been using them for around 7 years and the MH-C9000 revived the capacity closer to 2300mah."
5,Totally Awesome,"The only two things that stand out, aside from the overall awesomeness, is that this is a large charger not suitable for travel and the display cycles so you have to wait a few seconds to read the numbers you're interested in. Having large fingers and not needing to travel with this, the size is actually an advantage. I've been using this product for about six months withGE/SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries. You just pop in the cells and remove then when the ""DONE"" lights up. The default charge rate of 1000mA just happens to be what Sanyo recommends as the maximum charge rate for their Eneloop AAs."
5,Outstanding Charger,Ordered this charger to replace one made by another company that quit working. This one arrived very quickly and I am impressed with its ease of use and the various mode it provides in charging and analyzing your rechargeable batteries. Would definitely recommend as it is one well thought out and well built charger.
5,sturdy easy to use,Unlike so many products today the instructions are clear and well laid out. The LCD display is excellent and construction is solid.
3,"Great technology, engineering misses the mark","This AA and AAA NiCD, NiH charger offers great selection of functions and parameters, but it has hardly any preset charging or discharging rates and the user input method is miserable. Only the IEC ""break-in"" mode calculates the charging and discharge rates, once the battery's nominal capacity is input. Every other mode requires that you decide what rate(s) to use, giving you plenty of opportunity to undercharge or overheat a battery. I can live with all of this. What I can't stand is how easily the power cord works itself out of its jack in the top of the charger, given that the slightest interruption in supply reboots the charger to its default mode of charging at 1 Amp (for both AA and AAA!)I don't regret buying it, but I resent paying so much for such poor engineering."
2,Too Scary for My Daughter,"My daughter has loved Tom and Jerry, so I bought this for her as a surprise while I was out-of-town. Well, she couldn't watch much of it. It was too scary for her. VERY disappointed to have wasted money on this one."
5,Great product,"I purchsed this for my son & he loves it, it was a great price & shipped fast. Good length of time on the DVD also."
4,Interesting,"Sherinian explores the freedom he receives after leaving Dream Theater. Perhaps he went a bit overboard, but all in all, this is a good instrumental album with some excellent shiners like Day in the Sun."
4,Nice book,"I like this book mostly because my 2.5 year daughter likes it. As the other reviewer stated, the language in the book is rather simple. However, that is not an entirely a bad thing. My daughter has memorized most of text and now, is able to read it along with me."
4,Was hooked....,"I was hooked on this series from the start. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the ending was very disappointing. I was so upset that I wanted to demand they rewrite the ending. HA That just shows how addicting it was.So, for those of you who don't like to watch something without a fairytale ending (like I don't), I suggest you steer clear."
5,Beautiful Drama!,"This was the first drama I ever bought online and not the last. Highly recommended drama. A bit pricey at the time, but well worth it. Great shipping and delivery time, too."
5,Fresh takes on good music,"Debbie Davies does a great job here with John Mayall classics including ""Room to Move"" and ""Chicgao Line"". And a strong set of guest stars- Peter Green, Mick Taylor, and James Cotton all add appeal to a really strong set. Her versions are not meant to be exact copies but more affectionate tributes.She plays to her strengths not just the song's strengths. She's not going to get anyone to play Mayall's harmonica solo from ""Room To Move"" so she wisely steers clear of that but fans of Mayall and Davies will enjoy this as well as fans of good blues."
3,Not sure about the SACD pressing,"I agree with the other reviews that the performance is a fine one.The SACD pressing, however, is not that impressive. It is recorded at a considerably lower volume than the analog version. As a result, the final 2 movements which often are used to demo audio system capability sound pale. Take the same hybrid disk and play it on a regular CD player and it blossoms."
3,Good for the price,"Not all that padded but for the price, it's exactly what I expected. I wouldn't put my bass in this case if I were travelling a lot but as an amateur player it's perfect for me."
4,"Beautiful, but drilling instructions are incorrect.","The stainless steel shelf is awesome, I love it. But, the instructions tell you to use a 1/4"" drill bit for non-stud(drywall) mounting. You are to use the provided plastic expansion anchors. Well, the 1/4"" drill bit size was, for me anyway, too big. I recommend starting with a 1/8"" drill bit and using a slight circumferential rotation(wobble the drill a little) as you drill to enarge the hole slightly, then check the fittment of the plastic anchors. If they slip in effortlessly, the hole's too big or you'll need bigger anchors to fit snugly in the holes."
4,"Great jig saw, great price",This is a powerful unit and does everything you need a jigsaw to do.Bought reconditioned due to ++++ experience with Bosh factory rebuilt products.would recommend
5,Accurate Title: New Directions for Old Tunes,"This is (was) a very young band of very hot players. I recommend it highly both to listeners with a broad background in jazz and to those without. Those with a background will recognize all the tunes: Song for My Father, Recorda Me, Beatrice, Three Way Split, etc. They are all great jazz tunes, redone in a hip style. Those without a background will encounter a set of great compositions, played in a very engaging manner. The rhythm section grooves--hear especially the odd time-feeling of Recorda Me--the soloists are hot, and most of all the arrangements are novel and exciting. Greg Osby's alto playing is great, and the piano playing of Jason Moran is a special highlight. It is a CD that you can easily listen to many times over. I recommend it."
3,Concept of honor holds venture in right direction,"The concept of young cats playing the Jazz signature tunes of remembrance, Is not of Infant eyes,yet I must give respect and honor to any of the young cats playing this music. With this In mind and a list of classic signature cuts that cant go In the wrong direction, this recording manages to show moments of solid playing, yet It falls short on many of the tunes, the solos sometime lack confidence and go through the motions of improvisation, It lacks the power and virtousity of fellow cds released by Terence Blanchard and Nicholas Payton, yet Its concept and choice of tunes keep this cd from being a recording of minor league level."
5,Very Realxing,"This is another one of my favorite ""plinky"" music CDs. The music is great for meditation, relaxing in the tub, or unobtrusive background music."
5,Quiet Heart/Spirit Wind,"I just love it. It is beautiful, relaxing music & I would buy other CD's that Richard Warner has out in the future. In Fact, I am listening to it right now. Beautiful."
2,Buyer Beware!,I have ordered this CD new directly from Amazon twice now and both times the 2nd cd does not work at all. Very disappointed!!! 2 stars because I did like the one cd that worked but will be returning it since I didn't get the full value for the price. Did I mention how upset I am at the hassle and still not receiving a fully functioning copy of a much anticipated purchase? Do not buy until this issue is rectified!
2,Defective cd,"I ordered several cds of ""relaxation type"" and this is the only one I am dissatified with. I never have heard the music on it because it cracked or was already cracked (not sure which)from the center hole to the body of the cd when I placed it in my portable Sony cd player.I guess I am out the cost of this one."
5,Great flute music,This two CD set is great! I use it during energy work sessions as well as just to listen.If you like bamboo flute you will like this set.
4,Quiet Heart & Spirit Wind,I took a Tai Chi course at a local rec center and my instructor used this CD set. It is very nice for relaxing and ambiance.
5,A great album by a non existant band,"To be honest, I didn't care much for the film ""Prey For Rock & Roll"". I found it depressing an inexessible. Not so for the soundtrack CD! Excellent punk/metal with obvious nods to Iggy (""stupidstar"", ""the ugly"", ""my favorite sin""), Patti Smith (""pretty pretty"", ""every 6 minutes""), Joan Jett (""Ms. Tweek""), Courtney Love (""4 Into 3"") and X (""punk rock girl"", ""post nuclear celebration""). Best song: the title track. Interesting that one of the best punk albums of this decade is from a band that doesn't even exist! Here's hoping Gina Gersion continues on this track and gives us another CD.Other good soundtracks to not-so-good punk movies: ""Hard Core Logo"", ""Josie N the Pussycats"" and, of course, ""Great Rock & Roll Swindle"".And ""Clam Dandy"" fans should buy CDs by The Gits- who, no doubt were the inspiration for this movie."
4,Gina Gershon is a Fabulous Punk,"Rather than downloading all these songs from KaZaA or some other free mp3 program, I'd recommend you purchase this CD for three reasons - 1) Gina Gershon is on the cover and she's aesthetlically pleasing 2) The music's actually pretty good and if you liked the movie it'll cause minor nostalgia and 3) This is a CD you want people to see you have in your soundtrack collection :o)The music is all right - definately listen-worthy. I think some if it (if not all) was made specifically for this film. The tracks range slightly - otherwise they're all pretty much the same sort of stuff. (Amazon provides you with samples)Get the soundtrack, see the movie - it's all good <3"
4,Excellent singer,"Gina sings like she has been doing it for years,she sounds every bit the rock goddess she plays in the movie think of your favorite female rocker and she measures up to them. A most download for any rock and roll fan."
1,Are you joking? 1/4 star is a generous rating!,I'm a Gina Gershon fan but I honestly have to say that I rather have a root canal than listen to this album b/c it would be less torturous. Sounds like someone threw my buddy's cat in a potato sack and kicked it around the condo for however many miserable mins this CD runs.Just b/c you're hot and famous and look great in leather pants doesn't mean you can sing. Sorry Gina. Stick with your day job :)
2,A very bad Dictionary of Angels,"There are several books claiming to be dictionaries and encyclopedias of Angelic beingsThis is not such a book, there is must reading to find the most basic information on only a few Angels"
4,Basic but handy,"I bought this for my wife thinking it would be a great little pack for travel. Turns out she had to add a few things to get it to be ""adequate"". I still think it is better than nothing and handy in its little pack but could be more expansive."
5,Best history of VIetnam War,Another brillant work of Scholorship by Kolko. His material on N. Vietnam motivation is particulary interesting
1,One-sided leftist claptrap,"Found the book in the used section, was quite surprised at the unremitting whitewash of anti-RVN forces, but at least the dated Marxist terminology was quite entertaining to parse. Uncountable amount of opinion stated as fact, with very thin references. If you're looking for a black & white account of the conflict, this one's pretty good."
4,first act first affordable and good quality,I purchased the guitar because it was affordable and very stylish. I've been playing guitar for 17 years and just wanted something cheap and cool to play around with. I was very surprised with the quality and for the price I couldn't be happier. Great first guitar or second and very cool looking. For the experienced guitar player looking for something just to play for kicks..this is a great option.
3,Thread Count Sucks,"From my wife:The design is so cute, and really pulls together the baby's jungle nursery theme well. However, the threads snag and pull out so easily. I have this blanket laying out on a queen sized bed in his nursery, which I used as a changing table. I change him on this so this explains the ware."
5,This thought-provoking book speaks to my soul!,Fred is a God-gifted writer and encourager. He is a change agent. I am reminded of how Jesus brought radical change to the traditions of His time on earth. I pray we all become Christ-like and do the same.
3,A BIG OK,"I am slowing buying all of Woody Allen's movies in the Used - Very Good category of Amazon. This movie gets a huge OK from me. ScarJo is beautiful, Huge Jackman is beautiful ... but you already knew that. The movie is a murder-mystery-comedy set in England. England is also beautiful in this movie. I was a bit bothered by Woody's acting in this movie and perhaps he WAS trying to play an awkward little old Jewish man who couldn't act, but he did it looking like he was an awkward little old Jewish man who couldn't act. Scarlett's acting was a bit off, too. She was great in Woody's Barcelona movie but here, she was amateurish. She didn't convince me of not trying to act. The acting was what bothered me. Perhaps two other actors would have had better ownership of their roles and made the movie flow better.You might like the movie but this DVD may end up in my Charity donation pile.It is OK. The story is cute ... you may like it more than I did. Let me know."
5,Perfectly Executed Comedic Gem,"Charming, quirky, macabre, dark, mood lightening, well directed, hilarious... These are just the beginning of a much longer list of adjectives I could use to describe this wonderful film. If you are a fan of Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, or Scarlett Johansson you simply MUST see this film. The chemistry between the actors is delicious as are the wonderfully scripted lines and gags."
2,"Woody should stick to New York, or at least to the USA.","I don't think that Woody Allen's personality as an actor transcends the Atlantic. His kvetching and wisecracking among English society as portrayed in this film just didn't fit. Scarlett Johanssen was fine, but his performance was grating, and annoying.There was one major problem in the plot. How come the combination worked . . . wasn't that pretty much proof of the entire premise of the story. And it was never mentioned.All in all, it was predictable as far as Hugh Jackman's character was concerned, and I was glad when the movie was over. Woody should stick to New York, or at least to the USA."
3,LONDON MURDER MYSTERY,"Pale remake of MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY made in 1993, SCOOP is a bitter disappointment for the Woody Allen fans. During the projection of SCOOP, I had the strange feeling to watch one of his first efforts such as TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN or BANANAS. Like SCOOP, they were funny at times but they were rather a succession of scenes than real movies. Unlike Allen's precedent film MATCHPOINT, SCOOP is short of the elementary rhythm one can expect from an humourous movie. I just hope that only the guys in the editing room are responsible for this misfire. However, I still give three stars to the movie considering the always stimulating pleasure to admire Woody on screen.A DVD zone can do better."
1,Complete garbage,"I cared enough about your time to write this review to save you from this movie.Though the title basically covers it, I did want to address how insipid this film is on every level: extraordinarily bad acting (though Hugh Jackman is passable), transparent and awkward writing, horrible dialogue and direction...anything that can be wrong, was. No, that's not entirely accurate. The production, being set in England, was at least decent to look at.Take a hint from the cheap looking cover art (that was my first clue but I ignored it) and AVOID this film. There is absolutely ZERO tact, subtlety, and entertainment value. I don't know what movie these other people watched that gave it 3+ stars, because rating it at 1-star is being generous for me. It's nearly as bad as Rollerball (and that's saying something)."
2,Don't waste your time...,....boring and Woody Allen will drive you insane. He never stops talking!!!!
1,Ok to Miss This Movie (not even worth renting on DVD),"This movie was probably the worst I've seen -- at least in the last decade. I had high hopes for it -- the story line was inventive and could have been very enjoyable if written appropriately.But, instead of a tight story line with a few nods to Allen's antics woven in, this movie was solely a series of Allen's (badly done) vaudeville acts with a few minor plot elements thrown in so that the viewers wouldn't walk out. Allen's monologues (of which there were myriad) were trite, repetitive and added absolutely NOTHING to the story. Unfortunately, they were all that the story offered.All in all, I was extremely disappointed. I should have known that the movie wasn't worth seeing when I walked into the theater (at 9:45 on a Saturday night), and only 6 other people were there."
1,Purely awful,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing. I wish I had knitted a pencil sharpener muff, or assembled vacuums, or welded sheet metal earrings, or clipped my toenails while I watched it--anything to make the time spent ""watching it"" worth my while.I was left bored and unenlightented and without having accomplished any of the aforementioned things."
1,Big names can't save this movie,"Purchased this DVD because Hugh Jackman is in it, and I was glad to see other big names listed as well. There is no suspense and there is no mystery. One ""clue"" leads directly to another. Scooby-Doo had more suspense and mystery than this movie. Jackman's charisma and Allen's goofiness couldn't save this movie from itself. My husband and I chose this movie from our to-be-watched pile when we had no internet connection, no TV, and no phone service. After 10 minutes, we chose total silence instead."
3,Entertaining,"This is very entertaining, an HBO movie that you watch in the middle of the day when you don't have to work. Also, I do think Hugh Jackman is absolutely sexy...wow...but I think this was a good film to help me pass the time. It is cute and comical, and I don't think it's supposed to be anything more."
1,What Have I Missed Here?,"I had to give up on this movie 30 minutes into it, which is upsetting, considering I paid over $10 for a movie I lost interest in after the first 5 minutes. I totally agree with some of the other reviews, which indicated disappointment in Woody Allen's using the same old shtick for his own character. But I was also disappointed in Scarlett Johansen's portrayal, as I found it flat and almost uncomfortable.If you are intent on seeing ""Scoop"", I would recommend renting it, if you can still find it in a rental store."
5,vERY FUNNY,"i LOVED THIS FIRST OFF AS I LOVE BRITISH COMEDIES, AND THIS ONE WAS GREAT! IT IS A SUSPENSE MURDER MYSTERY COMEDY, I WATCH IT ALOT AND I LAUGH EACH AND EVERY TIME!"
2,Pale Imitation,"Imitation chick-flick/date-movie, a waste of performers's talents. Woody Allen charming, but barely a supporting character. Scarlett Johansson sweet but ditsy, much given to falling into sex with men with litle forethought. Hugh Jackman in a role well below his talents, his character unforgettable beyond being suave and handsome. Johanson speaks of her adoration for his character, but we see nothing showing this developing. (Teachers stress show, don't tell.) It is hoped better vehicles come along for all involved. Instead of this, watch anything by Allen, Jackman as a worthy love-interest in ""Paperback Hero,"" or ""Kate and Leopold."""
2,HERE'S THE SCOOP,"Clumsy comedy-mystery concerning a dead journalist, who receives a news tip that is SO good, he leaves the afterlife to pursue it. Another trivial parlor game from Allen, that beholds a comedic and cinematic vacancy under it's brisk and snappy pace. Scarlett Johansson is all nerves and girlish charm as Allen's counterpart, and while the film is dependent on their co-presense, the sparks between them fall flat. Hugh Jackman, as an English aristocrat who may be a serial killer, serves well as the film's contrast to the silly proceedings, but stands alone like a partner without a dance. At the theatrical viewing of ""Scoop"" that I saw, several young teenagers, there apparently for Johansson's sake, laughed uproariously at every good and bad joke Allen cracked. If nothing else, maybe the film will have a younger generation searching Allen's backlog of true comedic masterpieces."
1,Tired Woody,"After reaching a career high with ""Match Point,"" Woody Allen hits bottom in this romantic-comedy trifle - a tired rehash of his previous successes. ""Scoop"" ranks among Allen's weakest efforts and may feature his worst performance to date. Strangely cast as an old-time Brooklyn magician, Woody loses his comic mojo while delivering painfully flat one-liners. Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson register zero chemistry, but Ian McShane provides a few laughs as the ghost of an investigative reporter. When considering the amount of talent involved, ""Scoop"" represents a dismal failure by any filmmaking standard."
3,oh Hugh Jackman!!,"Scoop is not the best Woody Allen film, that's for sure, but it's funny and entertaining. Scarlett Johannsson is fantastic as usual but the real asset of the film is the gorgeous Hugh Jackman. He's perfect in this role: handsome, elegant, ambiguous and funny sometimes. And Woody is just Woody: one of the best actor-director ever."
1,So glad it was FREE!,"I rented this movie because I registered my TIVO with Amazon and got the $15 credit. I thought it might be a good opportunity to see some movies I wouldn't normally rent. I watched the trailer on this, thought it looked like it might be amusing, and downloaded it. Unfortunately, the only funny scene in the movie was in the trailer and I ended up falling asleep the first 30 minutes into it. After I woke up, I thought maybe I hadn't given it a fair shot and went back to try it again. I was right to fall asleep the first time through. I don't usually rate movies - or anything for that matter, but felt compelled to share my opinion with anyone who was seriously considering spending money on this one. Spend that $3.99 on a burger, or a good book...anything else but this."
2,"Poor writing, acting and no chemistry among the actors",I'd like to have that 1hr and 47 mins back. This is the bottom of the Woody Allen barrel. Among his worst.
2,Watchable -- but not by me...,"I paid $3 for this in a discount bin at my local ""dollar discount"" type place. At the time I figured ""how can I go wrong?"" -- now, I think it was over priced.If you like predictable plots, mediocre acting, jokes that fall flat, and the usual Woody Allen rants, you might like this. I didn't make it through the whole movie. I know that a lot of reviewers say that you'll never guess the ending. Sadly, I couldn't wait that long, and I really didn't care after about a half-hour."
2,Mediocre Woody,"This is not vintage Woody Allen but pleasant enough. The young actress, Scarlett Johnasson, made it all worthwhile. The actors did their best but they had little to work with. I was disappointed in the film because I'm a fan of Woody Allen, who has made some great films in the past. I hope Allen hasn't burned out and that we can still look forward to a few more fine films from him."
2,Place names obscured by physical features,"Many names of towns, regions, rivers, etc, are obscured by physical features such as mountains. Unfortunately, this is a fatal flaw in an Atlas that otherwise has much to commend it."
3,eh...too new agey,"Although I like some new age music, I guess it boils down to, I'm more of a classical Christmas music person. This is just too over-the-top new agey for me."
3,pretty good,"this is one of the better PS2 games i've played.. the story, dialog and how you go into the sewer is cool. the action is enjoyable. the graphics are good. what i don't like is 1. aiming arrows is too difficult in my opinion, making it not as fun to play an archer and 2. it gets kinda repetitive."
1,All messed up,"When I purchased this game it was suppose to be a Christmas gift. I received the game that is to be for a PS2. The cover said PS2, but when you open the game it was for a XBOX360. The game is useless for me and ruined my surprise."
4,solo para adultos,"En la ajetreada redacción del gran diario, los enredos del ambiguo Max Broden, casi adolescente, con el ya maduro plumífero Luciano Quaranta tienen los encantos -y los peligros- de un remanso.Allí, Quién que no era yo... se complica en mil intrigas cuya explicación, en la alternancia del hard-core, la ironía y la más extraña liviandad de lo neutro, confunde los humores de los personajes y del narrador a la vez que va tejiendo la tela -delicada e implacable- en la que caerá el lector."
3,Good review and primer for night flights,As a student pilot I read this book in preparation for night flying. It has a good overview of instrument flying and tips for how to best fly at night time.
3,Overall good,"I felt the writer did a good job of picking comforting scripture for the devotions. However, the writing seemed simplistic and didn't speak to me as a 54 year old widow. It was probably written for someone older than me; I'm not the typical retired widow who has a lot of time on her hands. I didn't dislike the book but didn't gain a lot of insight from it."
5,Finding Your Way After Your Spouse Dies,"This is an excellent book for a widow who is in that ""widow fog"" and having trouble reading much less comprehending. For my full review, please go to my blog at [...]"
4,Finding Your Way,This book was very informative and helpful. At a time like this you feelreally lost and it is good to have something to refer to that teaches you how to take those baby steps back to a normal life.
4,helpful,This book has some wonderful ideas for widows and widowers to overcome your loss. Thats why I liked it.
2,The same thing happened to me,"I too had the DVD player just stop working. My kids never touched it. I put it on and when they fell asleep I turned it off. Then the next day, the TV worked but the DVD player had no power. I took the whole dvd player apart to get the dvd out. There are alot of screws. However, there is two screws that you need a special bit for to unscrew it. You can get the dvd out though. I finally got mine out."
2,upsetting,"the same exact thing happened to me, now I have a vault disney dvd lost forever, and it was my daughters favorite movie. I even tried to take it apart to get the dvd out, still no success."
1,No more Memorex Products for me,"After my experience with a Memorex TravelDrive, I am never going to buy a Memorex product again. I do not trust the company. The U3 technology on the TravelDrive apparently overwrote or modified some system files on my computer and a card reader stopped functioning. After spending several hours trying to deal with it, I ended up hiring a professional to get things working again (and paid four times the cost of the TravelDrive). The TravelDrive also apparently put some programs on my computer in a hidden way that reinstalls the U3 junk on the TravelDrive if I remove it. I got the TravelDrive planning to use it to transfer files between computers but I would never expose another computer to this. This should have a rating of minus 5."
1,U3 the problem child.,"I have two of the Memerox 512 mini drives and also a SanDisk 1G jump driveboth have U3 software on them and all 3 have caused Windows fatal errors,when installed, shutting system down. On reboot the system hangs on these drives and stops. Did some web surfing and found alot of people have trouble with U3 and a hundred's of different conflict problems. Memerox support said remove Sonic MY DVD and a list of other dvd software confilicts with U3. Didn't work. Then said my USB ports won't support the drive. Found out if hold shiftkey down when installing drive, stops the U3 from loading, I can now copy files to the non U3 side of drive. Oh by the way even after gaining acess to the U3 part of the drive you can't delete or reformat it. Found good place for these drives called the trash recycle bin."
3,"Works fine, good value for the buck, but a couple minor issues keep me from giving it more stars","The sound quality is fine, I like being able to use the caller ID and adjust the volume, BUT... the remote unit is staticky (admittedly, I have not tried harder to resolve this issue), and when I cradle the handset between my cheek and shoulder, I often bump the ""transfer"" button, which I think transfers a call from one handset to the other, but ends up causing the call to be lost. I have retrained myself not to cradle the phone, but it's a minor annoyance.On the plus side, it's an overall good value for the buck, has all the features you could want, the answering system works fine (although we have since gotten voice mail so we stopped using the answering system), and its look is sleek. If you are not a phone cradler so you can devote both of your hands to another activity, this phone could be the answer to your search. If you are a habitual cradler, however, you may want to look elsewhere."
3,Sophisticated and stylish,"Elias' pianistic abilities and imagination make up for the lack of a great singing voice. Not my favorite of her CD's, but if you are a fan you won't regret owning this one."
1,Got that right,"1 1/2Boring robo-pop gloss aspiring to a third-rate Kraftwerk in finer moments, the group's sound will only remain relevant for the few Euro-club hounds whose idea of art revolves around thumping predictability and stale synthesized melodies."
1,Piss Poor Product,"Blue Rinnon Plant Sinkers are brittle and do not bend easily. They are useless, breaking easily when bent even slightly."
3,just okay,got 12 of these as the page says but on bigger plants you need two and one of the plants i have needed three! i have the fake plastic plants the very small ones were okay with one the medium sized ones needed two and the large ones need three or more which ended up making twelve not enough otherwise they work and once the plants are in the tank its not easy to notice they are on them and my oscars love that they can rearange the plants whenever they want without them floating and covering the top of the tank..every morning the plants are in a new spot..if you dont mind using more then one per plant then these work well
5,Essence of the San Juans - on one disk,"Refreshingly different than some of his earlier synthesized works, this CD uses sounds of the Northwest waterways with bass and piano that celebrates the San Juan Islands. Having lived in and near these islands for 25 years, no music is a close to capturing the feeling and mood during the stages of the day- twilight, a ferry ride, whales, a contemplative moment-- it's all here and if you can't tell, is my favorite Gettel CD. It's not the standard Gettel, but a work of art unmatched by his other works, and unique. Best shared on a summer evening with a glass of wine."
1,POOR - TOTALLY WORSE THAN VOL. 1 - WEIRD SOUND!,"I have owned San Juan Suite Vol 1 for over 12 years now and pretty much wore out the tape before I bought the CD. It is an awesome CD.Vol. 2 turned out to be a HUGE disappointment. The sound is totally different, and he uses a strange, low, synthesized sounding instrument in addition to the piano on almost every song. It is dull and actually annoying, and the songs sound very similar, not creative.Avoid this one, stick with Vol. 1."
2,Disappointing,"I recently bought this CD after having fallen in love with Vol. 1, and was so disappointed. I should have listened to it first, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor. Nothing new here."
3,frankly speaking...,"As with their ""midnight"" album, this one tries oh-so-very-hard to capture Frank's swing, his voice, his inflection, his phrasing... might seem amusing or cloyingly obnoxious, depending on your mood and tolerance level. Anyway, the band sparkles at time with crisp horns and percussion, making it somewhat dance-able. A pleasant album overall, but no comparison with the original."
4,Practical dictonary on Modern witchcraft,"This second book of Jan De Zutter is a useful lexicon. The book is in reprint in the Lowlands, perhaps you can obtain it here.De Zutter is a journalist of newpaper The Morning and leads a greencraft (alexandrian) coven in Antwerp. He also wrote books on prostitution, radical ideology among pagans and about wicca in europe. Sometimes he repeats his information to much, but it is still interesting."
5,The most sexy CD I own...,"... which is a fairly frightening declaration I admit, but nonetheless, this CD is beautiful, moody, dark, and occasionally spooky. The sound of the CD can be compared to a melding of trip-hop, electronica, dance music, and trance. If you like Portishead, Gus Gus, or Poe I would recommend this CD. I bought this CD in the Christmas season of 2000, and it is still in steady rotation on my CD player.Incidentally, I first heard of this band on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, much like the other reviewers below. Also of note, the actor who plays Giles on Buffy, Anthony Steward Head, is planning a collaborative album with George Sarah, the mastermind behind T.H.C. I can hardly wait to see what they accomplish..."
5,If you like this...,"If you like this, check out George Sarah's ""Opus Eleven"" album. It's a bit different, with different vocalists, but also very good."
5,Seduction,"Smooth sexy vocals, music you can feel, and poetic lyrics make this an awesome CD. Best tracks are 1,3,5(WOW!),6,and 7. If you like Enigma or Sade you may like the sensual voice and dig the trippy music."
2,Doesn't do it for me!,"With great expectations I slipped this disk into my player, sat back and spent the next hour trying very hard to find something to like about this CD. It had all the elements that I look for; trippy, down-tempo grooves backing female vacals, but they didn't come together into anything remotely close to even my least favorite tracks by Massive Attack, Hooverphonics, Portishead, Morcheeba, or Esthero. I love to explore new music, and my tastes are very broad, so I bought Adagio based on the reviews below. I have done this before with very good results. I have discovered gems like Kruder & Dorfmiester, Thievery Corp., and Gus Gus. There was no gem this time around. This album feels like it was recorded in someones garage. Most dissapointing was the disconnect between the music and the vocals. They simply didn't mesh. Who knows, maybe 5 years from now THC will mature and become a standout."
1,watch out,"If you did not notice it above this film is in German with English subtitles. So if you did not get your fill of reading a movie While watching ""the passion of the christ"" please feel free to buy this product. If you are like me and think that reading a movie takes the fun out of it then make this one a skip. Movie makers could at least give us the option of an english soundtrack. They can fit two versions of a movie on a disc but cannot include a dubbed version? too bad for those of us who like to read books not movies. This is the second movie I have had to return because it was subtitled. When you are writing a review it might be nice if you mentioned it was subtitled."
4,Vitus,"I have watched this movie 6 times so far..and I have never watched a movie more than one time before! Of course, I am a little prejudiced, being Swiss and a musician. However, I have shared the movie with other people, and they were all amazed how well it was done and how well the characters were portrayed. Furthermore it is especially valuable since the young prodigy plays the music himself, no substitutes there.."
5,Vitus Review,This is by far one of the best films made and that I have ever seen.The music and emotion of a young boy struggling to find himself inhis genius. I must say it was one of the better foreign films of this time.Cindy
4,Good book for a serious people!,"I think this book is quite a good overview on the modern financial subject. I myself am not a finance people but can grasp some ideas based on thier mathematic equivalent to my field study. [Brownian Motion, Stochastic Process, Random Walk etc.] It's amazing for me to link my background in Polymer Science to this new area quite well. [I observed that there is a new area called 'Econophysics'.. perhaps I am the people in this caterogy]OK... this book is not for a people who need a 'recipe' to make money. It's a good book for people who love to learn a new thing. I think a researcher from other area like Physics, Math/Stat or other academic discipline will find something useful for your starting point of a new area of finance.King+"
2,A book for Rocket Scientists!,The book sets well explaining in simple words the concept of investment and uncertainty but nothing points to what follows which is 300 pages of differential equations and complicated mathematical formulae. For people interested to improve their calculus to an advanced level this is the right book!!!!!
1,Greatly Overrated Academic Book on Real Options,"This is probably the most useless book on real options which I own. The book is extremely difficult to follow and uses academic mathematical notation which is difficult for practitioners to follow. In addition, the authors have largely ignored both the underlying business operations which create real options and the existing operations literature on project management, operations research, petroleum engineering, manufacturing systems engineering, etc. which provide many of the tools necessary for practical evaluation of real options. The bottom line is don't waste your money on this book."
1,Greatest dissapointment,"I was a big fan of Flor Yvon when I heard her sing in a compilation album, Mexico Voz y Sentimiento, a few years back. Her voice was beautiful and had a tone I had not heard-it was just right for that type of music. I thought for sure she would be the next great female ranchera artist. I bought this album with great anticipation and excitement. All I can say is that she has bad management. Her choice of music for this album was horrendous. It deviates from her strengths and was badly written and arranged. Her beautiful voice gets lost in this album and the songs seem like they were written and produced by an amateur. No wonder she disappeared from the music scene. A shame indeed. I threw away the CD."
5,Mind calming,"I love this CD, it's beautifully produced. I listen to it while I do my yoga and also just to ground myself when I know my thoughts are going everywhere. I recommend it highly if you are looking for something to bring you back to where you are."
4,CREATES A PEACFUL MOOD,Riley Lee has provided some beautiful Japanese music to provide peace and calm after a busy day at work.
5,Excellent,"What more can I add to what other reviewers have already said? This is perfect for meditation, relaxation and for just escaping a hectic and busy day."
5,Very nice to use for mindfulness meditation,"After I was more advanced with meditation and did not need the reminders to focus on my breath from my guided meditation cd of John Kabbot Zin I used this CD. It is really good, but I only use it for meditation, so I do not associtate it with anything besides meditation. I really like this it is just perfect for someone who is more advanced with meditation and already knows how to focus on their breath. I would not recomend this for a true beginner. John Kabbot Zins mindfulness meditation is the best and I even need it when I am rusty in my meditation practice and need to remember to focus on my breath more."
3,kids need help,"Got this for my 10yr old and we both have trouble following the directions. Its kind of complicated and for a lot of the assembly you need 2 people. He gets frustrated with it, but I think eventually he'll just start making his own creations instead of relying on the directions."
1,MISSING PARTS - MANUFACTURER COULD CARE LESS,"Bought this for my grandson, purchased it early (hugs mistake)- fast shipping, great seller, manufacturer sucks . . . . emailed them twice that there are 8 parts missing - nothing, tried to get contact information ie . . .phone etc, cant find it. Clearly they are not US based and you get what you pay for - its junk. I had one of these when I was a kid and this is not YOUR erector kit or anything even close to it !!!! Bottom line, dont waste your money . . .quality control went the way of US manufacturing jobs . . . . gone forever. Guess I will just have to be happy with the box of parts I have that wont build anything . . . . thanks for nothing !!!"
1,Not Erotic At All--Only read His Wicked Ways,"Have you ever read a menage a trois story with two girls and a man where the girls were not as intimate with each other as they are with the man? No, of course not. So why is it that when it's two men and a woman the men are not intimate with each other, other than the fact that they're in the same room having sex with the same woman. What's up with that? In this story the men do not get it on. So if you like your erotica as bland as cottage cheese, you'll like this story. Two gentlemen are offered the wager that they can seduce any woman in England. The woman chosen is a childhood friend whose husband has recently died and she blames the two gentlemen for not being there for her. They do indeed seduce her and all three live happily ever after. What a waste of my money?I will not waste it on Winter Thaw."
5,Very pleased to read it,"I just finished reading this book. I have read the three musketeers and the man in the iron mask a few years ago. Now, it is my attempt to try reading all of the series.First of all, this work did not disappoint me at all.However, the characters, in the first part of the book, are not as closed as it used to be, which clearly defies ""one for all; all for one"" spirit. But, behold ! it just gets better..My only disappointment with the book is that in the conclusion, d'Artagnan did not reveal to the queen that the cardinal hid all the gold from her.But, it is just my personal wish. Anyway, read it. You would not disappoint...."
3,A worthy sequel to Three Musketeers,"When I first saw this book,I expected a further story of D'Artagnan and his friends.I wasn't disappointed.D'Artagnan's rise in the ranks of the Musketeers and his reunions with all threee of his old comrades reaffirm their famous moto:ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL!I loved the delightful way Dumas blended actual history(like the 1648 Fronde rebellion in France or the 1649 rebellion in England)with the lives of these heroes,with Athos remaining the most noble and heroic.(Footnote:This is the only book that gives D'Artagnan's first name and the first one to give the real names of all three of his Musketteer friends.)"
4,Very not bad,"Dumas is one of the best novelists of his time. This one is definitely worth a look if you enjoyed ""The Three Musketeers."""
5,Is This Really The End?,"Is Twenty Years After really the end of the four adventuresome friends? Anyone who has read The Three Musketeers and this sequel will wish it was not. In this thrilling tale of friends divided by politics and united by friendship, a foreign cardinal, a powerful queen, a young king, and a Paris in turmoil, Dumas has again outdone himself. The cunning wit of D'Artagnan, the wisdom of Athos, the strength of Porthos, and the militaristic abbe Aramis are enough to return to France the power that it almost lost. In this moving tale of enemies become friends and the incarnate evil of enemies past brought back to life, one cannot help but wonder at all of the strange twists in the plot of this magnificent tale. A recommended read that will leave you wondering if this is really the last of four faithful friends or if their adventures are still just beginning."
4,Great to see Dumas back in vogue!,"I've read four of the five (and it's not a TRILOGY with 5, gang!), as well as 9 other Dumas classics now out of print. It's great to see the classics coming back in style again!! If you like Dumas, check out Rafael Sabatini. H. Godfrey"
2,Sorely Disappointed,"Three Musketeers is on my all time best books list. This sequel is no where close - not even mildly enjoyable.Three Musketeers is filled with action, laugh out loud humor and intrigue. This, its sequel, is filled with mind-numbing palace and political intrigue that is not very intriguing.The only part that was mildly interesting was how the four characters turned out after twenty years. There is also an intriguing descendant of deWinter, but his role is only sporadic.When I think of the original Three Musketeers fondly, I am sure I will have long forgotten this long interminable book of palace political maneuverings. If you loved the original and want to leave your recollection untainted - skip this one!"
5,It took me two weeks to read all 788 pages of it.,"If you are as devoted a reader as I am to Dumas, be sure to read La Reine Margot. This book has the action, romance and intrigue of the muskateer series."
4,Jennifer Who??,"The name Jennifer Hansen was vaguely familiar until I spotted ""Beautiful Goodbye"". I bought the cd on a whim and am very glad I did. It has become one of my favorites. I love the variety of music and was so impressed to find that Jennifer does most of her own writing. As far as the voice quality--that's a personal preference--her voice doesn't especially stand out to me as an unforgettable voice, but the songs themselves do stand out and her delivery is very convincing. I can't help but connect with her on ""Never Been This Far"". The upbeat songs are fun and light-hearted, but the ballads really speak to the heart. My favorite overall is ""Simply Yours"". Take a listen and decide for yourself! Overall for a debut album--2 thumbs up! I look forward to the next one."
2,"Well... one song was good, anyway.","I heard 'Beautiful Good-bye' repeatedly on the radio and really enjoyed it. It's so much fun to sing along with! So, when the cd came out, I grabbed a copy. I was, unfortunately, disappointed. Most of the other songs are forgettable, and lack that special touch that makes Beautiful Good-bye so wonderful.This cd could be classified as extremely mellow country, or very laid back pop. It doesn't really commit itself one way or the other.On the up side, Jennifer Hanson sounds eerily like artist Amy Grant. Her voice is so similar, it's scary. So if you like Amy Grant, you ought to get this cd just to hear quasi-Amy singing.To sum up, there's really only one song worth listening to on this cd. Buy the single."
2,just o.k.,"i totally disagree with alot of these other reviews! I really loved the debut single from this cd ""Beautiful Goodbye"", but I was very disappointed with the rest of this cd. A few songs are o.k. but the majority are kind of boring."
5,A great album,"This is a really great album. I have a very large collection of country music, and this is one of the best albums in the whole bunch. I think it is very well written, very well produced, and Jennifer's performances are great. The album has a nice variety of upbeat, cool stuff and thoughtful ballads. Jennifer's voice reminds me most of Roseann Cash, but that's not a bad thing. If you are looking for traditional country, this isn't it. If you're looking for some great music to turn up and enjoy, this may be what you're looking for. I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Definitely above average,"Yes, this cd is ""radio friendly,"" but don't dismiss it because it's easy to enjoy the first time around. ""Beautiful Goodbye"" is a catchy lead off single, and I'm sure anyone who enjoys it will find at least several other songs to put on their latest mix tape. I'm one person who's looking forward to more great tunes from Ms. Hanson in the years to come."
4,Must have for any Cosmos fan,Purchased for my Father in law who cannot wait to watch it. Definitely a must have for any Cosmos fan.
5,Outstanding book - very worthwhile,"In an overall sense, this is an outstanding book. Rybczynski, has an ability to force the reader to think about life situations normally taken for granted. In, Waiting for the Weekend, the author looks at several angles concerning the ideas of the ""weekend"" and ""leisure"". After reading this book, I will never look at leisure the way I did in the past. This is not the type of book to read if the reader does not want to be challenged. Rybczynski's writing style is thorough, witty, and informative. This is a worthwhile book."
5,"Durable, fashionable, thin, and well-priced",I am impressed by these control top tights. They are very durable unlike most of the other ones of the same price range. I would say they are very scratch proof. It also doesn't keep your body odor after use: it stays odorless after wearing them for a long long day. Amazing! I am very happy with them.
1,not like they used to be,"I bought Hue for many years - in fact, they were such great quality that I haven't had to buy any in several years. Well, they're not making them like they used to. The control top is a different fabric & while the old ones used to just give you a nice amount of comfortable control, the new ones squeeze & pinch like sausage casings. The overal quality seems to be lighter weight as well. I'm not impressed."
2,disappointed,Want so badly to find a good pair of black tights! Where are they? These ripped during the first wearing. The search goes on.
4,mrs,Super tight. I am 5'3 150lbs and I bought the 3 Wow..that is some control top. Super opaque and what I was looking for. Next time I will buy a larger size but I will buy again.
3,They are tights nothing more nothing less-average at best,Well aside from the fact that it took me about 5 or 6 month to recieve the product. I would say it was average with so-so fit and style.
3,really big,"I am wearing the size two. My height and weight are within the range indicated for this size. Yet, they are really big on me, with the waist band sitting mid chest. Not as opaque as I expected either, so these won't help much on a cool day."
2,Not that Opaque,"I erred on the side of caution and ordered the bigger size, hoping these tights would be super opaque. They lose their opaqueness with the slightest stretch, just like many of the tights I have worn before. Also, today is my second day wearing them and there is already the beginnings of a hole in the crotch. Kinda disappointed with these."
1,Only wore twice!,I have purchased Hue Tights in stores before and they have lasted years. I wore these twice and the entire back seam ripped. They were garbage after only wearing twice - terrible quiality!
2,Not even opaque,"I have long skinny legs and have been searching for truly opaque tights. These don't come close. If you just want some black hose they are adequate. If you want tights that cover your legs, try something else."
3,"Everything fit, but...","Everything lined up, on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, including the track and the window bracket.One problem was that the gear (seen at the bottom of the picture in white) did not fit my original (stock) window motor.The only reason I bought this was so I didn't have to buy a new motor too, considering mine works fine.The second and final problem was that the holes did not line up with the holes on my motor (so I couldn't attach the engine).Again the window regulator did not fit my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, as amazon had said it would.Other than that, the part was of good quality, infact it looked like better quality then my old stock window regulator that broke.I'd buy ACI again, but I only wish amazon would match the item to your vehicle more acuratly."
5,Excellent,The product showed up soon after I ordered. It was in excellent condition as stated. Very pleased with my purchase.
1,Product description and item do not match,"I love these pens and when I saw them on Amazon, I ordered them immediately. However, I received the .7mm pens instead. Not even close to the same great pen. Sending them back for a refund.... :-("
1,Not what is advertised,"Exactly the same thing happened to me. Amazon sent me the 0.7mm pens instead of what I ordered. Not only disappointing, but dishonest as well. If the item became unavailable after I placed my order then I should have been contacted instead of being sent something else."
2,It Falls Short,"Although I loved the interview segments with the motocross heros, especially Pomeroy, the footage of racing was lacking something. The camera work was unimaginative. Just a bunch of shots taken from the sidelines. It wasn't telling a story. Nothing to indicate where the footage was taken. No slow motion ""art"" shots. Just boring documentary type filming. I expected this film to come close to ""On Any Sunday"", but was completely let down. I will probably give this DVD to my older brother, because he is such a Palmeroy fan."
4,Overpriced but works well.,Costs was too much for the product that was received. Product looks like it cost about $2 to make. Product works well but wastes about 1/2 inch of the vegetable that is being processed.
2,not what i had hoped for,this product worked but not as well as the other reviews would have you belive.I spent more than I had planed to spend based on the revews I read. Wish I had just got the one I was going to get at first it most likly would have worked as good as this one.Just somthing to think about if you are going to spend the money.
2,Benriner Cook Help,"I purchased the Benriner Cook Help after playing around with a spirylyzer (can't recall brand) that I thought was a cheaper version. I was utterly dissappointed with the Benriner. My zucchini turned into a dissapointing mush. The handle needed to be ""jammed down"" during ""spirolyzing"" and the base was not wide enough to avoid tipping durng the process. Overall,I felt suckered. Isn't there a decent product out there, substantial in construction and easy to use, that actually works? I'd rather pay extra money for a good quality product that is easy to use and actually works than waste a small amount of money on junk."
2,Just okay...,I use this slicer for making Raw meals and it slices much thicker than a less expensive spiraler that I already own... It's not what I expected.
1,terrible,I just wished I saved my money. I am not a stupid person but this item is simply not worth the work involved
2,Singing birds with music,"Although there are singing birds on this CD, the music overshadows them. The music is lovely and relaxing, but if what you want is the sounds of birds, this CD is not for you."
3,This is piano music- not a paperback version of the book!,I just saw the words paperback in the title and assumed I was ordering a copy of the kid's book. When I received the book in the mail it was piano music. I have no piano training to know if it was a good version of the songs or not.
2,Give it a little time...,"We've owned and operated a dozen physical medicine clinics over the last 13 years. We have gone through more Jamar Dynamometers than I can remember. They simply do not last, even with good care and light to medium use. Every one we have owned has lost accuracy or simply stopped working, some after only a few months of use. Jamar recommends an expensive maintenance program, which does not guarantee that your device will stay in shape. If it has an oil leak, they will give you an option to purchase a new one for $65 off the list price, but will not fix. If you can't match your serial number with you company name, date purchased and billing info they will not even look at it. Unfortunately these are the best of the worst ""affordable"" hand dynos as we've tried the others as well. If you want something that will service your needs for a reasonable life span, look somewhere else."
4,good,"you need to make more movies with her in it the movie is good ,but hurry up and make a another one"
5,My son's favorite Halloween movie!,My sons watch Nickelodeon a lot and when this came on last year I was worried that it might be too scary. My 3 year old did find it a little scary but my 5 year old LOVED it. He watched it every time it came on and begged me to check OnDemand for it. After hunting for it on DVD I gave up and downloaded it to our PS3. My son was SO excited to be able to watch it whenever he wants. My kids think it's funny and the scariness is tempered with silliness. I even enjoy watching it. It's not Oscar-worthy or anything like that but it's entertaining. There are even some allusions to past Halloween movies (Mel Brooks fans will catch this with Brooke Shields' character).
2,Not good value for money,"Ducks, Geese & Swans is at best suited for children in the 3-6 years age group. Nowhere is it mentioned that the whole book consists of only 19 pages. Their is nothing wrong with the quality of the book, but it should be pertinently stated that this book is for children. The price also gives the impression of a more in-depth study of waterfowl. If you want a very basic introduction to waterfowl for your children, this might be it. If not - steer clear of this one. Your money can be spent much better elsewhere."
2,Much ado about nothing,"There is very little of substance to this book with regard to concrete suggestions on strategies a person can use to work with ADD as an adult - especially in the work place; lots of ""stories."" There is great emphasis about enlisting the help of family, friends, coworkers. People with ADD just want to work with it; they don't want their world to be involved in it. A very disappointing missive."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,I had such high hopes for this book guiding me through some very challenging times at work. While I gained some valuable tips from Making ADD Work:... All in all it has not been as helpful as some of the other books I am consulting. It comes off as more of a discussion group than a true problem solving solution.
2,Could have been a lot better,"A big fan of NASCAR I looked forward to this take on the behind the scenes of Jeff Gordon documentary. The DVD was fairly good, but seemed a little dry and slow in its delivery. As expected there are a lot of wonderful comments made about Jeff and his successes but it is taken a little too far and becomes repetitious. I think this DVD actually is somewhat of an injustice to Jeff and his accomplishments based simply on the way the thing is put together and delivered. Whether you're a Gordon fan or not, there is really nothing on this DVD that you don't already know or have seen. I would save your money until a better documentary comes out.The 2 star rating is based entirely on the way this thing is produced and not on Jeff Gordon himself who as I mentioned is much more deserving than what this DVD delivers."
2,Jose Feliciano's Christmas Album,"It had a few good songs and instrumentals including ""Feliz Navidad"" but it could have been much better. I was disappointed."
5,Highly interesting introduction to the New Testament world,"I found this book to be a great introduction to the NT world. Longenecker clearly delineates the portions of the narrative which are based on solid evidence, those that are somewhat speculative, and the rest which is completely fictional. This book was required reading for one of my seminary classes, and I found that I enjoyed it enough to highly recommend to my friends. While 'narrative through letters' style is not new, I must admit that I have not read many other book that fall into the category. That said, Longenecker pulls it over beautifully. This book would be a great gift."
4,Good merchandize but bad service,"The item was what I expected however, It took them weeks to have the item shipped. I sent over emails to follow up and they never responded. Bad customer service."
3,The Bedside Dream Dictionary,I was very disappointed. This book was not what i was looking for in a dream book. It's okay for basic information.
4,NEAR MASTERPIECE,"The first film in Larry Fessenden's unofficial ""monster movie"" trilogy (followed by ""Habit"" and the soon to be released ""Wendigo""), ""No Telling"" may be the best kept secret of the contemporary American cinema. Though sometimes its themes are a little too overtly spoken through dialogue (it is after all a diatribe against animal experimentation and a cheesy horror flick at the same time) this is a boldly stylized, thoughtful exception to the typical Hollywood excesses of the 1990's. Had a chance to preview the DVD, which comes with a not-to-be missed ""Making of.."" made by Fessenden, with his customary wit and mock self deprecation, in itself worth the price of the disc."
1,no longer for sale means something,"I bought two of these cushions because a co-worker of mine wanted one for Christmas and I thought that if she liked it then maybe it would be a good gift for my boyfriend. The concept sounded good- a heated, massage cushion that can be plugged into an outlet in your home or in your car. The good thing about the cushion is that it does get remotely warm so its nice if your backside gets cold when your driving, but the ""massaging"" part is just some fast vibrations which makes your teeth chatter and your muscles tense up. Its horrible if you have back and neck problems. I really wish that I could send mine back but since they were used as gifts (which I feel terrible about giving), then it will just stow away in some closet somewhere."
1,BEWARE! You will not get what you see,"They really do not have this pair in stock. They sent me a pair of cowboys and NOT a cowgirl and cowboy. When I complained, they immediately sent out the same wrong pair, and when i COMPLAINED again, I was told they never had the pair in the first place! Sorry! My kids were so disappointed."
2,Two cowboys,"I also got two cowboys. Amazon did replace my order which came with two cowgirls. So, I got two of what I thought I had originally orderd."
3,Missing Cowgirl,"This set came with two cowboys and did not include the cowgirl. The previous reviewer also stated this so I was not terribly surprised. The paintjob on one of the cowboys was much better (not sloppy) than on the other. They tend to be quite heavy and I am wondering whether typical Christmas tree branches can actually hold their weight. Despite these flaws, they are cute and children like these S'Mores ornaments."
4,Great book about the Fayette county area and coal miners!,Enjoyed the book so much since I was born and raised in this area!! Found out things I never knew about the valley and it's people.....
4,"Only as compared to ""Cockadoodledont""","This is TLSS's first album, and while it sizzles with the same energy of their latest ""Cockadoodledont"", it is somewhat tentative in comparison. Comparing the two songs that appear on both albums (""Hunkerdown"" and ""The CB Song"") finds the renditions on this album not quite as rich and glorious as they would become later. The sound is a little ""thinner"", I guess you could say - the arrangements of the songs just not packed with as much intensity and fire. This album is a plate of hot chocolate chip cookies, whereas ""Cockadoodledont"" is a big pan of jet black chocolate fudge with frosting flowing over the top and down into the oven, making a smoke that fills the kitchen. Also the band is entirely different on this album - only that hairy lunatic Colonel J.D. Wilkes is the same.Buy this - it's great. ""Sherrif's Ranch for Boys"" is especially good. But don't stop here. BTW, their new album is due out in October of '05. Yahoooo!!"
2,returned this book,"With today's digital recording and tiny microphones I expected authentic sounds...... there were none, just weird scratchy, nothing like the sound of an engine."
2,Not Perfect,"Although my 2 and a half year old son normally loves these kinds of books, this particular one didn't live up to the test. My son is not a rough kid, but when the sound stopped working after only half a day he easily tore the sound panel from the book. The watch type batteries couldn't be replaced so we had to throw that part away, but still have the book. There are better made sound effects children's books out there."
1,This DVD is absolutely horrible.,"I love Zeke and I really hoped that this disc would be good... unfortunately, it is not. The editing is horrible. The sound is horrible. The presentation is horrible. Everything about this disc is horrible. This disc would be worth $3.99, just because I love Zeke... otherwise, save your cash.In short, this DVD is worse than a really bad bootleg recording."
5,I will tray to review before to buy it.,"I could like to use this book in one of may subject that I teach in Monterrey Institute Technologic Campus Chihuahua. The name of the Subject is ""Developing Multimedia Systems Applications."" And is one the course of the undergraduate information systems programs."
4,Celestial healing music,"I just wanted to say that this CD is a great for using during a celestial healing (angelic healing), it sets the mood and helps create the space of being in the angelic realm."
4,"Not Smokin', but Good Pie","If you liked ""I'm a Fool for a Pretty Face"", you'll like this album. The first 6 tracks are the strongest. If I had to lose a cut, it'd be 8. ""My Lover's Prayer"". Altogether, this is a good enough record to be in any Marriott / Pie fan's collection."
5,Extremely Helpful!,"A truly amazing textbook! Perfect for teaching a genuinely biblical theology of mission. It scores high on doctrinal orthodoxy, exegetical scholarship and apologetic/missionary engagement in the contexts of contemporary global-local realities. A rare combination! It has a defiantly high Christology (YES!), a breath-taking appreciation of the Old Testament's all-too-neglected treasure-trove of teaching for a fully integrated Christian worldview, a surprisingly refreshing exposition of familiar New Testament texts, and an authentically 'global Christian' perspective that holds so much promise for Christianity in the 21st century. This is the kind of Bible-sourced, intelligent, horizon-expanding reading that young Christians worldwide need to read for their theological formation, to live and preach the Gospel of Jesus as Lord and Saviour to their grim and jaded generation. As a teacher of theology, I am thrilled to recommend it!"
4,Excellent Text on Missiology,"The Message of Mission is more of a biblical theology of mission, or missiology, than it is a book on missions. The authors explore key biblical passages to investigate the mandate, message and mission of the Christian church, especially the character and purpose of missions. With the authors representing both East and West, their scholarship has a refreshingly global character. Their approach makes good sense. As our world undergoes dramatic changes, it is important to return to Scripture to gain guidance for how the church should address changing needs. Although the flow of the book seems to falter at times, I would still highly recommend this book to those interested in missiology. If you're looking for a ""how to"" book on missions, you might want to skip this text."
3,"first-rate performance, bad engineering","Litton and the Dallas Symphony give a technically brilliant performance. I bought this album for the Festive Overture, a difficult piece to find played by a major symphony, but enjoyed the other works as well. The major drawback is the absolutely awful engineering. It sounds like it was recorded at a very low dynamic level as noted by other reviewers, then ""played with"" to make it sound more ""dramatic."" It did not work! If you are looking for a great Symphony No. 5 with superb sound, try the Previn/Chicago Symphony remastered edition with the 4th as a great bonus. It is an interpretation with real bite, superb playing by CSO, and exceptional sound. The Haitink/Concertgebouw disc is DDD, and the interpretation, while a bit more reserved, is also spot on."
2,Turn Up The Recording Volume!,"Although the performances MAY be excellent, you'll never fully realize it because the recordings on this CD were done at such a low lackluster volume. At the beginning of the Festive Overture you can barely hear the clarinet solo and are constantly straining to hear details afterward. Very poor. Don't waste your money on this CD, there are many more worthy performances available."
1,Looks good but lasts a week,I bought this case so that I would have some protection against everyday scratches and shock-- however this seems to be too much to ask. I dropped my phone on the ground (as I was sitting in a chair) recently and the case just snapped in two places. This shows how poorly made this case is-- I would advise anyone who may drop their phone from 2 feet high to consider buying a better quality case. I went ahead and bought another case from a different company-- I can probably say this is the worst $12 I have spent in a long time.
1,Didn't work for me,The case wouldn't even snap together but it was so inexpensive it really wasn't worth the effort to do anything about it. I will not purchase anything like this again.
1,One good song,"The intro started this CD off ok. It wasn't anything special, but most intros aren't. It went downhill from there. I honestly didn't like anything after the intro. It's amateur hip hop at best. Not everyone can do it, and not everyone should."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Faerie biffo.""The elf raid on Trollheim was to be a strong one. Fifty longships were manned with the best warriors of Britain's elves, and veiled and warded by the soreries of Imric and his wiest warlocks.""""Ax and sword! Spear and club! Cloven shield and sundered helm and ripped byrnie! Red gusy of elf blood meeting cold green flow of troll's! Auroras dancing death dances overhead!""Trolls 1-0 ElvesSkafloc the elf survives, becomes an outlaw, as his evil twin lives it up. He realises he has to fix Thor's broken sword to have a chance to win. He also happens upon the bright idea of asking the Tuatha de Danaan for help. Add those two together, and a whole lot of trolls learning that sleeping with the enemy is really stupid, you have :Trolls 1-1 Elves, Elves win in extra time."
5,diana will touch you with this cd,this is one of dianas best lps from 1973.it includes the title cut that was a #1 pop hit and helped push this lp to #5 on the pop charts here in the us.the lp gently moves from classic pop with the tilte track to smooth r@b to jazz as the cd glides along with one great performance after another from ross.i think this lp could have done without the cover of the Carpenters songs and perhaps included some of the unreleased tracks Ross recorded for her unreleased standards lp from that time period.perhaps one day we will get a deluxe treatment for this cd.this is without a doubt one of her best ...even with the carpenters cover.a lovely performance by ross.should have also included the extended version of the tilte cut as well.
4,"""Classic Ross""",Loved this album as a teen in the early 70's. I was thrilled to have a chance to revisit on cd. It is classic Ross.
5,From a Supremes vocalist to a Supreme vocalist !,"The first time I heard ""Touch Me in The Morning"", it was evident from the opening bars of the song until the last note that her performance, was stunning and destined to be her second solo #1 single.(And the first of her recordings with Michael Masser, who co-wrote among other songs they recorded together,""Theme from Mahogany"" and ""It's My Turn."")The rest of the album lives up to that standard. Compare her interpretation of ""Little Girl Blue,"" to the version recorded on ""The Supremes Sing Rodgers-The Complete Sessions,"" to experience her growth as a vocalist."
5,Touch Me in the Morning,Touch Me in the Morning was one of Dianas' greats..I wish the rest of the album could hold that type of excellence...Its said there was tension between Ms Ross and Michael Masser but one can only wonder the great music they could have made together..considering some of the other great music he made with Whitney Houston on her first groundbreaking album and other works..but we will never know..
4,At her best,Touch me in the morning and all of my life = all time classics.we need you and leave a little room are just beautiful.Great cover of i won't last a day without you and john lennons imagine
1,What is this really for?,Is this for my pets or is this for my garden? I have had great success with these sprays for my farm animals. But I've unsure with the description how and where this is actually used. I'll be checking back to see if anyone responds.
2,"Fluff, fluff, fluff","I was extremely disappointed by this book. Rather than a complex exploration of a generation (""Generation J"") of Jews who are searching for what it means to be Jewish in the postmodern world, this book is a rather fluffy and trite exploration of one woman's rather shallow search for how she could be a Jew without having to be Jewish. In this facile work, she ends up where she started because it wasn't a search at all. Perhaps her editors just saddled her with inappropriate marketing and a bad title. Something like ""How I Stayed Jewish Without Feeling Too Bad About It"" would have been more appropriate."
2,a good magazine article stretched into a mediocre book,"This book is a story of the author's personal adventures rather than a intelligent exploration of Judaism, so if you're looking for the latter don't bother to read it. If the most entertaining and interesting portions of this book had been boiled down into a magazine article, it would have been a cute, amusing 15 minute read. A few of the stories I liked--her antecdotes about the mikveh gave me a better feel for what that ritual was all about, and I think I understand the Jew/Buddhist relationship a bit better than I did a few days ago. But I'm not sure it should have been turned into a full book, and she padded it out with bits of silly whining (in the ""why won't the rabbi help me marry a gentile"" vein) and stories of utterly icky behavior (misc. tattoos, including the very last story). At the end of the book I was left thinking ""Eeew, Gross!"" Bottom line: worth skimming but not worth reading."
3,Not what I expected.,"Although it was interesting hearing about Lisa's journey to finding her Jewish place in a non-Jewish America, her story did not relate to the masses. If your story differs from hers in any way, the book looses its value. I was hoping for it to be suggestions on how to find your Jewish place, but instead it only told her story. Other than that, it was fun to read and a well written memoir."
2,Memoir,"Ms. Schiffman's book is not at all what I thought it would be. From the jacket, it appeared to answer all of our questions about why our generation grew up in non-religious homes but we seem to be lingering back to our parents/grandparents Judaism. Problem... she doesn't discuss this. She talks about her own life and why she hates/loves Judaism. She's angry that she couldn't find a rabbi to marry her, but she married a gentile. Sorry Lisa, but I have better things to read than your life story!"
2,Pointless Journey,"While I admire the author for undertaking a journey to find her spiritual roots, and publishing an account of that journey, I find her methods utterly laughable. She goes to everyone but Jews to validate her Judaism. When a person tries to learn about something and their place in it, its best to go to the source of that thing. She generally ignores the idea of talking to and interacting with other Jews, is very uncomfortable with her own heritage, and regards any steps which she makes as little prizes to be shown off and complimented on. It's also a very misleading cover- the book does not talk about our generation and our attempts to examine our Judaism, only hers. The book is readable, but just barely."
2,More personal than I expected,"I feel that this book was somewhat mis-marketed. It is a very personal, ideosyncratic journey through Judaism in a very specific place, with very specific issues. I had hoped for more of a broad survey of how young Jews in America are approaching their Judaism, the questions they are asking, and the answers they are arriving at.Instead, it is primarily Schiffman's own personal experiences, flavored heavily by her own prejudices. While this can be the basis for an interesting exploration, I don't think she ever really examined her fundamental beliefs and postulates in a way that provides her a usefull base from which to extrapolate her own experiences."
4,Thorough but won't help with VB updates,"I bought this book so that I could update a Visual Basic application that had been written for Access 97. Unfortunately, I discovered that you would be better off rewriting the entire application because updating from 97 is essentially impossible. This is a great support book for intermediate and above (not for beginners) but it will not help you upgrade from Access 97 applications."
5,Simply excellent,I will only say one thing. These books are simply excellent.I can only recommend them.PS: I'm really 45 but the review form accepted only 12 as max age
4,Thrilling Stormy Weather,"A very impressive recording. The song: Stormy Weather is a real thrill. Summertime is also a joy, and my favorite Summertime recording. Just simply a very exciting recording. In conclusion, I want to listen to other Lena Horne recordings."
1,NOT THE RCA ALBUM PICTURED!!!!,"This does NOT seem to be the actual RCA-Bluebird reissue that is pictured! SEE INSTEAD:Stormy WeatherThis deserves zero stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that!"
3,Somewhat biased and fearful to tread in dangerous waters.,Drug abuse damage to the children is brushed aside. A little overly-political correst.
3,so and so,"the book is nice but the quality is not so good.it was ""like new"" but it isn't (borders at the angles are not in good conditions).lucky me the inside is ok!I guess it happens."
4,nice new book,"This a great photography book. The prints are very nice.If you like Joel Sternfeld, you will love this book."
5,Love em!,"I normally get the Hanes or Fruit of the Loom for women and haven't been overly impressed, so I was a bit scepticle when I ordered these. Well not any more. I absolutely love them. Then seem to be made very well and fit nicely with a nice flat waistband.I have horses and when I ride, the others often ride up on me which is very uncomfortable. These stay right where they should be and make riding my horses a much more comfortable experience! I would definitely recommend and will purchase more of them in the future."
2,"you get what you pay for - rough material, bad fit","I did not think underwear can make a difference. Cotton briefs are cotton briefs, right? No, if you care about whether fabric is rough and pilly and the shape is shapeless. The price is good, but here there is a correlation to fit and quality."
3,Ok,"It was an ok book. Didn't really come together till the end, made it hard to understand and really enjoy."
3,The Maneater Rulez,"This is the most unexplainable book! I cant say whether its stupid or ot. its so hilariious but has too much of inimportant and useless stories which have no relation with anything. i have to write a book report so i read it. anyone else who has too will really like it. i didnt think it would be good but pretty much liked it. i like the ending especially. anywayz, now i'm going to copy the other persons review, give it to my teacher and get 5/5. thanx amazon and the reviewer from manchester!"
4,Unknown Gem,"Terrific EP reminiscent of Rockpile at their peak, apparently better known for his compositions, Mr. Kennerly deserves to be a star in his own right. Other than his single on A&M in '82 (produced by Edmunds), it is not clear if he has any other recordings of his own."
5,Very good show!,"We purchased this set because we love Two and a Half Men. It is a great product, quality discs, and NO COMERCIALS!!"
5,That's what the Spankers are about,"This is of course not the best place to start your collection of Asylum Street Spankers CDs. Nasty Novelties is for the advanced user of spankings only. The titles say it all. Are they nasty? Oh boy. Are they fun? You bet. How is the music? Spanktastic. If you want me to love you, buy Spankers CDs and go see their concerts."
3,"Ok, but.....","nice and small, but not enough intesity control, goes from 0-60 with nothing in betweeen"
3,Feelin that good vibration,This is actually my fourth time purchasing this item. My only disappointment is that the item pictured is the one that I normally get with the three inch rod. The item I received only has a 1 1/2 inch rod. Difficult to hold on to but same great power. I prefer the three incher so I probably would not dare to order from this company again fearing that I would receive the wrong one again.
2,NOT QUIET!!,"Not even sort of ""noiseless"" ! Actually this is powerful but louder than the standard version we already had. If your looking for a silent addition to your bed room this is not the one for you"
3,Not my favorite.,"The packaging was flimsy, but for the price I wasnt surprised. I bought this to experiment with new types, but I'll just stick with my previous one. It has medium vibrations, just too localized for me. All in all, save your money."
1,"Bon Apetit: Travels Through France - Knife, Fork, &Corkscrew","BUYER BEWARE!!! My daughter collects Mayle books. Imagine the disappointment and disgust to find I had purchased this book, only to have it the very same book as ""French Lessons"", which I had purchased several years before. How was this allowed? Very discouraging and misleading."
2,disapointing,"Purchased for a '08 500 Sportsman. Save your money. May quiet other ATV's but not worth it on Polaris. Most all noise you hear is engine not exhaust. Objectively, I would say you may experience 20% reduction in total noise. That is my opinion."
2,What happened to the Kings?!,"Man, this CD is not what I was expecting. After Rollin Stoned, they have been losing the punk - rock - rap style. Little guitar riffs and they changed it into underground rap. Kind of Crunk, underground rap. I guess it's more mainstream but I'd rather listen to their old stuff. High Society is their best Album. Rollin Stoned is pretty good too. Oh well, new sound but I'm still gonna go to their concerts cause they get the crowd rowdy!!! d[-_-]b"
4,Warn 31727 for Ram 2500,"Installation is straight forward, easy instructions.The problem I have is the tube is so heavily powder coated I have had to file and scrape for hours to let my Cargo Carrier, Front Ball and Winch Basket slide easily in and out of receiver. If it would have been only one of the items I tried I might have dismissed it, but every 2"" Accessory I tried to put in took a hammer and an extra set of hands to put in and remove. But all these accessories fit the rear factory receiver just fine."
1,Never received book,"Ordered the book, but a refund was initiated apparently because the book isn't available although I am not exactly sure."
5,good for kids and moms too!,"i love this stuff,,,i make myself frothy milshakes twice a day.. much healthier than frappacinos sp? or other milkshakes! gives me more energy.. i also put it in brownie mixes so my kids get even more nutrition! jen p."
2,not interesting,"We have read many books for our 1.5 year old. This one is probably the least entertaining and only mildly educational. Miss Spider's ABC's, Sandra Boynton books, lemons are not red, don't let pidgeon drive the bus are much better."
3,Not the same as the big books,"We were a little disappointed with this book and a couple of the other board books in this series. Our one-year-old son LOVES the full size ""How Do Dinosaurs"" story books, but he hardly pays attention to the board books.First of all, the words and rhymes aren't as clever. Maybe the concept of counting or colors just isn't as good of a material as going to bed, eating your food, or going to the doctor.Second, the books are short and the artwork is very scaled down and much simpler. My son loves the artwork in the bigger books but the white background in these is kind of boring.Maybe time will tell, but he is getting past the board book stage and I am just not sure that these books will hold the attention of kids who are at an age for learning colors or numbers. I wish there was a full-size version, and I wish I had known the content of the board books was not as good as the big books. Now YOU do!"
4,"Too Similar, but...same great pictures!","If you don't have any of the books in this series, definitely get one! But...unless you have a kid who is REALLY into these books the dinosaurs, etc...one is plenty because they are so similar i can't remember which one i have read! and my oldest son LOVES dinosaurs!"
2,an archieve of old Typographica Magazine,"The name ""Typographica"" sounds great but may be misleading! It's not an index book or source about nowadays modern typographic design but a memory of Typographica Magazine which has been published over between 1949-1967. Includes collected sample pages and scripts from the old magazine. It's just history..."
5,Brilliant product,Rare cd much required by Stravinsky enthusiasts. The best reocrding of the Flood and Movements available.
4,Very good taste.,We enjoyed the macadamia nuts but I felt they were tooexpensive for us to order very often.I would recommend them as a special treat.
4,Overall good effort by Arkenstone.,"David Arkenstone puts in a solid effort on his album Another Star In The Sky, dedicated to the memory of his mother. Sure, Arkenstone's not a great singer, and he's only a mediocre lyricist. His real gift is melody, and there are plenty of strong tunes here, ranging from the Moody Blue-ish ""Far, Far Away"" to the Native American themes of ""Canyon Of The Moon"" and ""Naked In The Wind"". Nice!!"
4,The worst of some artists is better than others' best.,"I'm in the process of collecting Arkenstone, having only discovered him a few months ago. What I've been missing! This is not the strongest of the six albums I have to date, and at first the vocal tracks irritated me (I had gotten used to thinking of him as an instrumental artist, and was not expecting them), but they've grown on me. ""Pool of Radiance,"" ""Canyon of the Moon,"" and ""Ride into Midnight"" especially are worth the price of admission. ""Naked in the Wind"" has my partner muttering, ""I'm sure that's Cheyenne."" Don't forget to look for more of Arkenstone's work under 'Troika' a trio that performs his compositions."
3,PLEASANT CELESTIAL JOURNEY,"This early 90s effort is certainly pleasant enough. Heavily synthesized with sweeping strings simulations, it's refreshing to hear 'real"" instruments as well. Arkenstone also adds his vocals to three tracks---not a great singer but it does add variety to the mix. My favorite tracks are the cinematic flavor of CANYON OF THE MOON, the buoyant drive of TAKEN BY THE WIND and the haunting POOL OF RADIANCE.David has attained a respectable reputation in the New Age community, offering enjoyable if unremarkable collections."
3,Nice CD,"This earlier work by Arkenstone and I enjoy it more than a lot of his later work. Not one of my top 2 CD's by this artist though: ""Celtic Book of Days"" and ""Spirit Wind""."
3,friction 5,I think I've alredy reviewed this book and so totally not what I thoght it was going to be. For some reasone I thought it was going to be a single story.
5,Excellent buy,"Bought this for my daughter's birthday, couldn't have been happier with the item, just what we were looking for. Just as described/pictured, extremely fast shipping. Highly recommend this vendor."
4,swamp classic,"man this cd is a classic.it features tru.master p,silk,young bleed,to name a few.this original version is very hard to find,but i have 3 of them UNOPENED 4 sale.have a ton of out of print cds,decent prices. drop me an email."
1,Not worth the paper and ink to print the book,"I am a gang and youth violence expert working with the San Diego County Office of Education, Safe Schools Unit. I have alerted many of our schools about the series of books by Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams. I do not recommend the purchase of this book. The content of the books are not appropriate for young people. The images of gangs are not accurate (Too much negative sterotyping). The book is written in a simplistic style that will quickly bore young students. Youth need to critically examine information not be talked down to. You may email me for alternate suggestions for gang prevention books for youth."
2,Not worth it this time,"I religiously buy the San Francisco guide of Zagats as I found it to be the best resource. However, the 2004 issue is very disappointing. I don't agree that 24 of the top 40 restaurants ALL being given the same score. Also, one of the restaurants that was named in the top 40 for food was in actuality doing very poorly, brought in a new chef, a new menu, and new decor. There was no mention in the review of this.With Zagat expanding into other areas like movie reviews et al, it is obvious that the quality control of the restaurant guides is suffering. If you purchase this book I would ignore the reviews and use it for more of a convenient restaurant phone book."
5,Kelly dolls are so fun,Kelly dolls are so cute and fun for my 3 year old to play with. She plays with them in her Plan toys dollhouse. They have adorable little girl faces. I would rather her play with these than Bratz dolls.
4,"Great Vacuum, Great Price","After reading other reviews from buyers of this item, I decided to go ahead and buy this vacuum. It is indeed a great deal. I needed to replace my older Hoover with one that is more quiet and powerful. This one fits the bill. It is definitely a powerful vacuum. The carpet in my bedroom was always a problem to clean with my other model, but this one sucks everything up quickly. It is still a little noisy but very acceptable. Love it."
4,Good vacuum after some trouble with the first,"We purchased the Hoover windtunnel vaccuum. The first one that was shipped broke the first use, a little plastic piece came off when I changed it to the hose portion of the vaccuum. We contacted amazone and they sent us at no charge a 2nd one. This one seems to work pretty well and after about 10 uses it has not broken. It does seem to pull the dirt out of the carpet with the upright part, however the hose suction is a little less than I hoped for."
4,So Far So Good,"We've only had the product for a short time, so durability remains to be seen. Just my impression is that the construction might be a little lightweight, but we'll see. The performance so far is great! This thing sucked up things we didn't know existed in our carpet! We love the little power attachment, and it is very light so pushing is easy. Cleaning the filter is not a problem as we have seen some people complain about, we really don't know what their problems were, quite simple actually. We have recommended to friends already."
4,Hoover Turbo Power,"This is by far the best vaccuum that I've ever owned. With two rough collies, I needed something that would work well with dog hair and this product does it. Great power and suction. The attachment with the brush does tend to get a bit clogged with hair though, but its easy enough to clean out."
5,Best Vacuum I have owned!,"This vacuum cleaner picked up rug dirt and cat hair that my canister vacuum left behind. It's easy to empty and the ""turbo"" head for the hose pulls up the mat of the carpet on our steps. This is the first air powered cleaning brush head that has worked and it works well."
4,Fabulous price!,"Great product that does the job. My only issue is with the bagless system. A lot of large debris like cat hair gets through the screen filter between the intake side and the HEPA side. Cleaning the HEPA requires a lot of tapping to get fine particles out of the folds. I now use my old canister (also HEPA) to vacuum it out. I also wouldn't empty the bagless cup inside the house at all. Take it outside and use a small trash bag held as close to the unit as possible to prevent dust flying, then vacuum it."
1,HORRIBLE vaccuum!,"Yes, when we first bought it, it worked great!! Loved it! And I loved the ""clean/dirty"" lights. But after 3 weeks of use and replacing the filters it no longer was picking up pet hair or lifting up matted carpet, and it began to smell like the a belt was burning. My husband (very handy) tried his best to fix the problem and no luck. We returned it to Costco thinkig it was just a defective model. We got another one, AND IT DID THE SAME EXACT THING. We even read all the paper work to make sure we were doing it right! I then looked up reviews all over the web, and Amazon is actually the only place that gives this vacuum a good review.Finally, we returned the vacuum and we're now trying the Eureka Altima, which I've yet to hear any bad reviews online (and not just from the Amazon site). And on the first pass, we found way more embedded dirt and hair then the Hoover ever did."
5,A Great Product,"This vacuum is powerful & easy to clean. I love the attached tools. It is heavier than I thought it would be & doesn't roll real easy. However, this machine really cleans."
2,Worked great while it worked; very short life,"This vacuum worked great for about the first year of use but died a lot sooner than I've ever had a vacuum die before. It still runs, but there is no suction and the level adjuster for the beater doesn't work so the beater never touches the low carpet in several rooms. We've completely taken it apart and put it back together...there are no blockages, no slipped belts, no obvious reasons why it doesn't work. The repair guy looked at it and said 'throw it out; buy something decent.' So...if you want something that will last a little while but work great while it lasts, this is your machine."
3,its okay,"I must say that I was expecting a little more out of this highly rated vacuum! It is nowhere near quiet like I had hoped...very noisy. It does pick up everything, but to clean out the container is kind of a chore. It will work for now until Im ready to spend more money on a dirt sucker.."
3,Hoover Vacuum,"I didn't realize this vacuum would be so heavy, but the worse part is that it is soooo HOT. You work up a sweat vacuuming just pushing this thing around, but having the heat coming out of it just makes it worse. Vacuuming in the summertime is the pits, even with the airconditioning on.I have to say though, that it does a very good job at cleaning the carpet and lifting the pile. The carpet looks great when I'm done, I just look like heck.Hoover U5725-960 TurboPower 6500 Windtunnel Bagless Upright Vacuum"
3,It's ok,"So I had two of these vacuums and they work great for a while and then slowly but surely, they stop picking up the pet hair. I have a cat and now two long haired dogs. The dogs don't shed that much and I attempt to keep up with the machine but no matter the tender love and care I put in it. The machines just gradually go down hill and I have only had my current one about 2 years if that. I want to buy a Dyson but some say it's not worth the price...I am waiting for the off brand :)"
4,superior cleaning,"Although a bit heavy, vacuum does great job. Grooms carpet very well, better than any vacuum I have had. Not to good if you must carry it up and down stairs."
5,My All Time Favorite,Had to buy another cd as the first one wore out from over use. Great to accompany meditation or as back ground music to set the stage for a lovely time!
1,YUCK!,"Cloying, ooey-gooey essence of banality. The CD is composed of syrupy synthesized strings played behind aimless piano tinkling. This is the sort of nasty treacle that gives music flying under the moniker ""new age"" a bad name. AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, if you are in anyway prone to depression, do not buy this CD lest you begin poking yourself with sundry sharp objects. I suppose if it helps you relax, it's an improvement over heroin. I can't imagine anyone being addicted to this. If you're interested in mellow piano music, check out George Winston or Clara Ponty instead."
2,Nice music - POOR SOUND !!!,"There is not much I can say about Mike Rowland music. Simple melodic piano tunes with synthesizer strings. I like it and it's the reason I bought it.I originally had bought the ""Fairy Ring"" on tape, and quite recently I decided to buy it on CD too, to enjoy it on my just bought, multi $$$ thousand stereo system. The man who remastered the recording however (if anyone did at all), must have been deaf. The CD sounds as bad as(if not worse than) my worn-out tape cassete. I was thinking of buying ""Titania"" too on CD, but I probably won't after that. That's too bad for the music cause I honestly think it's worth it. I hope the ""Fairy Ring Suite"" sounds better."
2,"Yet another tired, relatively thoughtless, retread","Here's a group whose output desperately calls out for a good, well thought out, boxed set. This ain't it. Instead, you get a straight reissue of their first eight albums. Ho-hum. I can't imagine that anyone who'd even consider buying this set wouldn't have most/all of these already. The packaging is nothing special, nor is the accompanying ""book."" Instead, I'd recommend you buy the REAL crown jewels--the first four albums--and flesh those out with the hits discs for most of the tracks you'll miss. One day, someone will put together a real boxed set that traces the history of this group with key tracks, unreleased masters and scholarly annotation. Until that day, save your money."
3,"Great Music but the ""Box Set"" leaves a lot to be desired.","As I knew it would be, the music on this collection of CD's is fantastic! The 1970's Queen music was by far their best era. I was however very disappointed in the cheap package that came with this collection. The CD's are simply packaged in paper jackets that will be destroyed after a few uses. The book is nothing more than lyrics to the songs with a handful of pictures. Nothing too interesting. A band with the history that Queen has has got to have a TON of interesting things to put into a box set. But unfortunately you won't find much here. I would like to recommend to the people at Hollywood Records to go buy AC/DC's Bonfire collection and study it to learn how to make a quality package."
4,An Excellent Source for Writing Treatment Plans,"This is a great book for help in writing treatment plans. The book is vauge, however, in that in clumps together a variety of disorders for one specific treatment. Nonetheless this is a great book. You won't regret the 40 bucks you spend on it...It's invaluable"
3,Tx,This is geared toward licensed therapists. Not AOD counselors. I didn't really have a grasp on what it could provide in my arena.
1,There are far superior conga players...,"Not bad for a Spanish Harlem boy from the corner of 111th, who spent his youth banging tin cans, then split the US for, of all places, Sweden, then ended up ditching music to run a strip joint and then die while working on some travesty of a project for Richard Boone. That's just a history lesson. Honestly, you can hear much BETTER Sabu Martinez playing on some other Blue Note records, where he appears as a side-man, such as J.J. Johnson's lp's. This...it just gets a little tired, very quickly. It's noticeable and rather sad.At any rate back to the disc at hand, it's very much in the tradition of conga that was popular at the time of this recording. But, there are far, far, far superior recordings available that deserve your fanbase and $$, rather than this. Pick up anything by Patato or Candido, or even Francisco Aguabella. It will be money better spent. All in all, to be a bit more accurate, I'd probably give this a 1.5 to 2 stars."
5,Even better the 2nd time through!,"I know the experience of this book should be tempered knowing it has potentially fictional parts that may not be distinguishable from the facts . . . but the overall impact for me (even the 2nd time through) is an enjoyable read. It lends great perspective of WWII that we don't get in school! Afterall, we don't say 'truth is stranger than fiction' without reason!!!"
1,A counterfeit spy,"The most respected historian in the field of espionage, Nigel West, studied all of Aline's spy books marketed as nonfiction and concluded ""...all four of Aline's books should be regarded as fiction, and nothing more..."" Read ""Counterfeit Spies, Chapter 3, by Nigel West, 1998."
3,One year of adventure,"When this book first came out I read it with the eagerness of a vicarious adventurer. Now, many years later, I read it again. Yes, it is dated and is pretty unbelievable, but still a fun adventure. It could be said that it is a female James Bond story. Our book club is discussing the book, and I am sure it will be a fun meeting."
5,An Awesome Book!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was extremely interesting. My enjoyment was enhanced by the fact that it was based on real events.
4,Intriguing!,"THE SPY WORE RED is a first hand account of WWII espionage set in Spain and told by Countess Aline. This is a fast-paced story just filled w/ interesting characters both Allies and Germans--friends and foes. The most amazing aspect of this book is the fact that Aline is so very young and inexperienced when she is ""recruited"" by the U.S. government and sent to ""spy"" school. Her ability to move through Spanish society and gain confidences that enabled the Allies to carry out secret missions is quite remarkable.THE SPY WORE RED was a book club discussion choice and provided us w/ lots of meat for discussion."
4,Good Overview & Basic Real Estate Primer,"This book is used as a college text for Basic Real Estate 101. It covers just about every Real Estate topic you can imagine, from brokerage to finance to appraisal and so on. Whether you are trying to learn about the profession of Real Estate and the types of jobs that entails or if you are trying to improve your knowledge of the sales process, this book will give you an excellent overview."
1,Body Language In Action by Richard Mulvey,"I can't say if this dvd is any good or not. It's listed as ""All Regions"" in it's ad, but it will not play on my dvd played and just gives a message about being the wrong region. I would not have ordered it if I had any clue that the ""All Regions"" designation ment all regions but the one I'm in. My dvd player is not that old. This has given me reason to doubt ordering dvds from Amazon again."
2,Sub-par Mendoza project,"This one didn't do it for me, and I'm a huge fan of Vince Mendoza. His arrangements save this from becoming a really dull excursion. Honig plays like he's heavily burdened by something...no excitement to these ears, and nerves could have been the issue. The real disappointment is the drummer who plays so heavy-handed without complimentary dynamics, no bounce, like he was having lots of trouble following the charts and dared not add anything at all to the pieces. Maybe nerves also contributed to his conservative approach. I wonder if Mendoza in this context would have a choice in contracting the musicians?Anything with Vince arranging, though, is worth a listen, so 2 stars for him and the nice mastering."
5,This may be my favorite movie of all time!,"I watched this movie with my two daughters and it moved us all. We went out and got cds of the early Temptations that we listen to all the time. The acting is awesome - we especially loved the portrayal of Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin. You will not be disappointed -- get this movie today! I had it taped but ordered it on cd! The TEMPTATIONS will never die!! Almost forty years later my mom, me and my girls (three generations) are still loving them -- how many groups can say that!!"
4,Enjoyable,It was an enjoyable video to watch however the movie did not go into a lof of details and some of the facts were modified for TV movie purposes.As a Temptation fan you will enjoy it but if you are real big fan and have followed the group over the years you will be dissapointed with some of the glossing over. I would have liked to seen about some of the other members in the group.
2,Poor video,"The video is very poor on this, but hey it's the Temptations! It's not my favorite concert but I'm glad I have it. But if you are craving listening to the Temptaions, get the movie instead. It is excellent!!"
1,Do NOT waste your time!,"This video was horrible! Not only was an hour and a half missing from the video, the most important parts were left out! What was the point of putting half of the movie on tape? TRUE Temptation fans would appreciate the full length of the movie all 4 hours! TRUE Temptation fans would want to see all the ego tripping, backstabbing and smooth dance steps of the guys. What a waste of my time and yours too, trust me! Beg NBC to replay the movie! You'll understand where I am coming from."
5,The Temptations,"My husband and I love the music sung by The Temptations,the movie makes you love them even more. What a shame tohave achieved so much only to have so many unfortunatecircumstances befall the group. We highly recommend thismovie, especially if you love Motown, 1960's.G. Hargis"
5,The Temptations,"Musically oriented filmmaker Allan Arkush directs this fine biopic which tracks the legendary career of The Temptations. One of R&B's most influential, revered bands, the five men enjoyed overnight success and helped define the Motown period. Like many other success stories, though, this one has a dark side -- with self-destructive impulses and personal problems threatening to destroy the band's reign. In addition to capturing the drama of the group's rise and fall, THE TEMPTATIONS features eight of the classic songs which made them legendary, including ""My Girl,"" ""Papa Was A Rollin' Stone,"" and ""Get Ready."" This movie is absolutely wonderful. The amazing acting, wonderful storyline, and admirable tear-jerker ending. You'll love this classic."
5,The Temptations,"I thought this was an excellent movie. I lived in one of the close by suburbs of Detroit an remember The Temptations well. They were a great group, extremely popular once they climbed to fame, but had so much heartbreak in their lives. It was an outstanding movie, a movie that you don't mind watching more than one time."
1,They suck,This company is no longer selling on Amazon and I heard that via email from Amazon. They have refunded my money. All this before I could even file a claim. Amazon really is great and I am happy they have recognized and resolved the problem. Thanks Amazon!
1,Not Happy,"I was not happy with the Video. I had it taped from TV years ago and so many parts were not included in the VHS I received. Why advertise such a great movie and take parts out, it is not fair."
3,What A Rip Off,"Who ever decided to cut so much out of this video was an idiot. Those of you who brought this video got ripped off. Those of you who plan to buy it, you will not see the entire mini-series. I was fortunate enough to order the tape from NBC the night the Mini-series aired. That version is the whole mini-series. Marla and Tara are absolutely correct in their reviews. The song Paul sang Marla was ""For Once In My Life"", It was the party scene after the TEMPTS had won a grammy. You also don't have Smokey singing ""Be Careful What You Wish For."""
5,The Temptations,"I believe this is the kind of movie you can sit down and watch with your family. It isn't like all these other movies with all that violence and foul language. I like the way Otis tell his story, he describes those thing he went through so well , I feel like I was there myself. All the characters fit the parts they played well (especially Christian Payton). I really enjoyed this movie alot and I think Otis tells his story well."
5,Excellent!,"I live in Detroit, and was amazed at how accurate the Hitsville building was inside & out. The choreography was great. The acting done by Christian Payton, and Terron Brooks was magnificent. It is uncanny how much the 2 of them resembled the real Paul Williams, and Eddie Kendricks. I wish I could give the movie a higher score. After seeing it, it turned me into a Temptation's fan (of the Classic 5 anyway.) Ignore the critics, and enjoy the music."
4,Great movie,This is a great film. The best part of it is the music. The acting is surprisingly good.
3,Tempted to Watch It Again,"I loved the early part of the movie. It shows how this phenomenal group came to be, how their energy & passion propelled them into fame. My only complaint is that it seems the producer tried to cram in a great deal of their lives but without significant depth. Should have been a two-parter, but I'll still watch it more than once."
2,Temps Movie,Very bad quality. It gets dark and light all through the movie. I watch this movie at least once a month and I hate the quality.
1,Delivery date way past,"I have watched the movie on TV, that part I am happy about...the movie is brilliant.I placed the order on 27 January 2007. The expected delivery date was the latest 8 March (standard international delivery). I still haven't recieved it today on the 15th of March. That part I am not happy about."
5,touching movie,"THE TEMPTATIONS WAS A FAVORITE OF MY HUSBAND AND I. WE SAW THEM IN CONCERT NUMEROUS TIMES AND WATCHED THE MOVIE NUMEROUS TIMES AS WELL.MY HUSBAND LIKED THE SONG THAT WAS SUNG AT THE FUNERAL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, REALLY GONNA MISS YOU. HE TOLD ME HE WANTED THAT SONG SUNG AT HIS FUNERAL.WELL IN MARCH, MY HUSBAND PASSED AWAY AND I HONERED HIS WISHES AND HAD A VERY GOOD FREIND OF OURS SING IT AT HIS FUNERAL.YOU WOULDNT BELIEVE HOW IT TOUCHED PEOPLE. THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR EVEN ASKED ME IF I COULD GIVE THEM THAT SONG TO THEY COULD OFFER IT TO OTHER FAMILIES."
5,Excellent!!!!,"I can't stop looking at this movie. The actors almost had me believing that they actually were The Temptations. They were excellent. The casting director could not have found a more talented group of actors. I loved all of them, but especially Terron Brooks' portrayal of Eddie Kendricks. This movie is definitely a must see. If there is a part 2, I hope that they get the same set of actors to play the roles."
4,"The ""Temptations"" review",The movie was excellent but the version I recieved cut off the credits. I wanted to know who played each part. Also the part about how David Ruffin died was not factual.
5,"Temptations - Today, Tomorrow & Always Forever!","The Motown sound lives within the very essence of me. When this movie came out, I had to have it. Watching this movie draws you even closer in knowing each individual Temptation more on a personal basis. The Temptations are ""the sound"" of Motown. Nobody can even come close to being as good as they are. The Temptations are and always will be #1 in my heart! I have even purchase The Temptations Live In Concert to complete my set. God bless each and every Temptation past & present. And to you Otis, my friend, never let your candle go out. You have brighten so many lives, including mine. God bless you my friend."
5,A MUST SEE FOR ANY MUSIC FANS,"I WAS NEVER A TEMPTATIONS FAN UNTIL I SAW THIS MOVIE. I HAVE SHARED IT WITH EVERYONE I KNOW AND THEY HAVE LOVED IT AS WELL. MY MOTHER HAS GONE CRAZY OVER IT AND IS PURCHASING ANYTHING WITH ""THE TEMPTATIONS"" NAME. THIS SHOW SHOULD HAVE WON THE AWARD IT WAS UP FOR. THE ACTING WAS WONDERFUL. YOU COULD NOT TELL THE ACTORS WERE NOT SINGING THOSE SONGS. THE CASTING DIRECTOR DID A WONDERFUL JOB. I LOVED THIS SHOW AND EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT!!"
5,The Temptations DVD,"The DVD was in excellent condition even though it was used, also i recieved it quickly in the mail. It was real easy to submit my order. I definatley will use Amazon again!"
4,great movie depiction of the temptations career & lives,"this was a really good movie, I enjoyed all the old music from the 60's & 70's & felt like I got to know each member of the group. Anyone who likes the Temptations or Motown music will love this video. Does anyone know who Leon is that played David Ruffin"
5,Brilliant,"Before this movie, I liked the Temptations but I didn't realize just how talented they actually were. The actors in this movie: Terron Brooks, Charles Malik Whitfield , DB Woodside, Christian Payton, and Leon did an excellent job in portraying these fellows. This movie is filled with the ups and downs that the group endured along with songs that make you boogie. Plus, if you're confused about all of the people who came in an out of the group over the years this movie's got it covered up until the late 80's. If you loved the Jacksons miniseries or the Little Richard story you'll love the Temptations!"
3,DVD format wasted,"This is a great movie, but one expects more from a DVD edition than this one delivers. For example, the original run time has been trimmed from some 3 1/2 hours to 150 minutes. The pivotal scene which explains how the name ""Temptations"" was arrived at has been deleted along with others. The result is a great loss of continuity. It's certainly a worthwhile view, but if you're expecting the extras that come along with most DVD versions, you'll be disappointed."
3,Hurt and Disappointed,"I loved the movie when it aired on televison, but I was SO hurt when I finally found the video. The video was CUT horribly. There were so many small details about David and others that were missing from this video. The movie was so great that it was a huge dissappointment to have ANY of it left on the editors floor."
5,LEAD ROLL FOR TERRON BROOKS,"After watching this movie over and over again aleast (50) times studing the acting ability of each of the actors....I just know Terron Brooks would make and exellant choice to play the part of Marvin Gaye...another great star that was ahead of his time....Terron has his moves,looks, and I'm sure after studing Gaye's past concerts he can master his sexy style...have Terron ever been approched to play the part of the late, great giant?....Oh, do Terron respone to his e-mails. I really want to know his opinion.THE TEMPTATIONS # ONE FAN FOR LIFE R. M SMITH/ & IT'S NOT JUST MY IMAGINATION THESE GUY'S ARE STILL THE BEST"
3,a good movie if you aren't concerned with facts,"I have watched this movie about a dozen times and loved every minute of it. Then I read the book that Otis Williams wrote, and that the movie is supposedly based on. Almost every scene is changed. From who sang lead on certain early songs to who said what and when. Places, dates, characters names, they changed 90% of it to suit their movie. I don't understand why movie makers do that, nor do I understand how Otis Williams can allow it. It's a great movie if you don't ever read the book and don't care about the truth."
5,The Temptationd DVD,"GREAT entertainment if you love the old Motown, Soul, and Volt-Stax Mussel Shoals studios music sound. Also good if just interested in some of the early roots and groups of this phenomonon. It gives a look at a number of the Motown artists we all know about as real people with the same joys and struggles that we all share.I saw part of this movie\mini series on cable one night and as soon as it went off got on Amazon to see if it was available. I think just about any music lover will enjoy this."
4,Great biography of one greatest R&B Group of the sixties,"This is a great movie if you like biographical drama of the entertainment industry. It filled,with drama, musical numbers performed by the actors who portrait this famous group. There is love, unity, friendship, egoism, etc. This is real story of a group's humble beginnings to their ending. You love the music, the drama and the actors."
3,Temptations (VHS version),"I had already watched this on DVD. A reviewer said that the DVD version was cut - much shorter than the VHS one. So, based on this, I got the VHS version. I was disappointed to find that in actuality it was the VHS version that was cut, not the DVD. Sorry I wasted money on the VHS version. UNcut, this movie is a mustsee for Temptations fans.In 1967, after a Temptations concert at the old Latin Casino, my buddies and I accepted an invitation up to their suite. Although all of the group members we met were friendly and perfect gentlemen, I remember David Ruffin above all. Mr. Ruffin chatted with us, played records for us, let us take his picture with us, was down to earth, friendly, and very funny. I saw no evidence of the unstable and troubled David Ruffin who was fired between '67 and '68 who is portrayed in the movie. He was the perfect gentleman that night with us. That is a wonderful memory indeed."
5,it's the greatest,i've watched this video over & over again....my 15yr olds granddaughter & 15yr old niece have both become temp fans frm watching this video...a must see...the uncut version is the best
4,A good movie.,"I was reluctant to see this movie, after having seen movies like ""The Jacksons,"" ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love,"" that Little Richard movie, and the ""Five Heartbeats,"" which is STILL my favorite. I just didn't want to see Leon in yet another music movie role. I kind of saw bits and pieces of this movie on Christmas day because all of my relatives wanted to watch it. Our DVD seems to be uncut; the missing scenes were there. This movie wasn't all that great...but it was GOOD. But I must hand it to Leon; he was good as David Ruffin. AND he was hillarious--that scene when he comes to the concert and grabs the mike and starts singing AFTER having been fired from the group is CLASSIC! Good for a cold winters night, but ""The Five Heartbeats"" it ain't."
5,CLASSIC ENTERTAINMENT!!!! EMMY VOTERS TAKE NOTE!!!!!!!!,"A TRAGIC TALE, TOLD IN EXCELLENT DETAIL-FEATURING FINE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND CHOREOGRAPHY. LEON TRULY DELIVERS AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE! THE SOUNDTRACK SIZZLES RIGHT OFF OF THE SCREEN! TEMPTATION FAN OR NOT, THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE A PART OF EVERY VIDEO COLLECTION....."
5,"A MUST SEE MOVIE, GREAT FOR ALL AGES","I ABSOLUTELY POSITELY LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! I HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME FAN OF THIS GROUP SINCE I WAS A KID, BACK IN THE 70'S. AFTER I SAW THE FIVE HEARTBEATS, I KNEW I WAS GOING TO ENJOY THE NBC SPECIAL, WHICH I RECORED. WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. THE TEMPTATIONS CAME TO NAPLES, FL OVER THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, AND WHAT A CLASSY AFFAIR IT WAS. THE INVITATIONS HAD A STRICT DRESS CODE GIVING DETAILS OF WHAT TO WEAR. IT IS AMAZING THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THE GROUP HAS MAINTAINED SUCH CLASS AND GRACE. THE NEW GROUPS SHOULD TAKE SOME POINTERS FROM THEM, MAYBE THEY WILL LAST LONGER, IN OUR EVER CHANGING MUSIC INDUSTRY."
5,"Tall & Talented...Teasin' & Tan, Back to Back & Man to Man","I am a serious fan of the Fab Five (48-yrs old). I was afraid to watch this film because I thought it was going to be another 5 Heartbeats (ugh!). I was pleasantly surprised and appreciate the respectful treatment and superb portrayals of the greatest male group ever. All the actors captured the souls of ""Corn"", ""Ruf"", ""O"", ""Blue"" and ""Poopie"". I watch it everyday to cries of, ""Mom, Please! Not again!"" Does anyone know who does the singing? (When the records aren't playing, that is). This is an excellent effort. Payton and Brooks are subtle and hauntingly accurate. It's like seeing the ""original"" tall, tan, talented, teasin', temptin' Temptations all over again. (Which are the only Temptations, for me.) Watch this movie then listen to Paul's live version of ""For Once In My Life"" and Eddie's treatment of ""You Can Depend On Me""...and you'll agree, ""Temptations Forever."""
5,one of the best movie i have ever seen,THE TEMPTATIONS MOVIE WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN WITH SO MANY GOOD LOOKING BROTHERS IN ONE MOVIE. AND MOST OF ALL (CHRISTIAN PAYTON) TOOK MY HEART AWAY IN THE MOVIE I DO WISH HIM THE BEST OF LUCK.
2,Jerry's songs,"Song selection was not as good as expected, and sound quality can only be described as D minus."
4,Great Buy!,I was looking for a camcorder to film my young child as she grows and anything else important. I find this one very easy to operate and very compact and neat. Picture is hi resolution so it looks really good on TV. It also takes great snap shots I have gotten compliments on how nice it is.My only negatives are the DV tapes are kind of expensive (2 for $16) and I have not yet figured out the CD that came with it. It is easy to save on a video cassette tape but I havent figured out how to save to a DVD.Great buy for the Price Amazon provided for me!Amazon's great!
2,"nice look, bad quality",this camcorder has a very nice look and compact- but has grany picture indoors and unbearable motor noise- received today- returning tomorrow
5,Just for Fun,"Loved this series since it first started. Will continue to collect the series to enjoy sans commercials. Plus, it's nice to get to see some scenes that needed to be omitted for commercials."
1,"Squab, 2 and a half ment","I never received this episode. It was the first one I was trying to get but it never came. So, I paid for it but never got it. It would be nice to have it. I bought my Kindle new and had no idea how to work many of the things on it, no instructions."
5,"Great Characters, and constant laughs!","I've never really watched this show before, but my mum and brother love it. Ordered this season as it was good value. I loved every eposide, great writing, great comedy, great acting, great cameo's, can't beat it!"
2,product quality,The quality of the DVD's in this set was so bad I was forced to return them. Disc two was completely unuseable.
1,bad customer service!,"I e-mailed the seller on this twice and contacted Amazaon as well to help me get a hold of this seller... I wanted to see if I could upgrade to faster service on shipping. But I coulnd't even get this seller to respond!!!I will not use this seller again, they can't even reply to a simple e-mail!!!Tammy Smith"
2,eh.,"This show is funny, but it is with all of the wrong things. It deals with sex, sex and more sex. That is not the only thing to make jokes about. I know several other struggling comedies on TV that can't make it even though they are absolutley amazing. How I Met Your Mother or 30 Rock are amazing shows that do not base their jokes strictly off sex. (Yes, they do contain it, but it isn't shoved down your throat over and over.)"
5,Still hilarious!,"Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer are the perfect ""brother"" combination. The show is comedy at it's best!"
5,Every episode is good.,You can sit and watch season two episode after episode. They seem to blend together like it's the next day or a few days later and Charlie and Allen are up to something new again. This is something I can watch over and over again!
4,Men men men,Can't go wrong with two and half men. Decent pricing on brand new DVD. Most I see are like 30 bucks.
5,Love it!!!,"If you want a good laugh ,buy this...now!! I have nothing bad to say, this is great and as usual Amazon is great with shipping...fast and cheap. I have Prime and I love it. Amazon is great!"
1,Oakland Raiders Bumper Strip,"I got the bumper sticker promptly, however; It wasn't the sticker I order and the stickers I received were faded. I sent an email to the company and no one responded. I just ended up eating the cost."
5,Absolute Blessing,"Vashawn Mitchell's CD is a an absolute blessing. Whether you prefer contemporary or traditional gospel- you will be blessed by this album. Also, if you enjoy D. Lawrence, Karen Clark-Sheard, Byron Cage, etc., then you should definitely add this one to your collection. I would encourage you to read the lyrics before listening to the CD because they are empowering. Stay encouraged and blessed."
3,Necessary if only for one song!,"I will purchase a CD for only one song if I like it enough, and this disc is such a case. 'Anna' is definitely one of their best songs, and a must-have in my pop collection. However, I found that the rest of the album didn't have any other standout tunes. If you want to sample classic Spongetones check out their first CD, 'Beat and Torn', a cleverly titled compilation of their first album and EP. This is pop (power or otherwise) at its best. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Honest Review,"Lets face it a Strategy Guide for DoA3 is very lame. BUT it is insightful. Another reviewer said that it's as useful as a guide for Pong. Well they have a point, DoA3 is a fighting game whos objective is to bash the other player. Play long enough and you learn how to do just that. What this guide shows you is how to do it in style, how to take out the other guy with that rare combo, and with some practise do it everytime. If you are like this Gamer, who is NOT 14 and can NOT spend 12 hours in front of his XBOX (though I wish I could), then this guide is for you. Enjoy it.PS Rember Pong was the #1 selling game for a long time back in the day."
1,useless and stupid...,Strategy guides are horrible. Why use one ESPECIALLY for DOA3? ITS LIKE A STRATEGY GUIDE FOR PONG!!!!!!!
4,Another good short-story collection,"Of the three collections by Haldeman that I've read, I'd have to put this after None So Blind, but before Dealing In Futures, even though I gave them all 4's. It contains a good number of stories, and as always, the first entry is excellent. Two of the reasons I love Haldeman's work are evident here - his descriptive ability, and the fact that his stories don't always end on an upbeat note. One problem with this collection in general, however: Haldeman is a combat veteran and has a graduate degree in physics... almost every story's main character has some advanced math/physics aptitude, is a vet, or both. I can understand putting yourself into your work, but this is too self-indulgent. If Haldeman weren't such a good writer, I would have tired of this very quickly.*Unfortunately, you'll have to haunt the used bookstores for this one."
3,necessary topic,"The novel is a good read and covers a much needed topic in American Literature: the experience of Chicano/a people during the Vietnam War. The novel promotes a sense of responsibility of human beings for one another, regardless of race or nation, and this is an important message in our times. At times the plot was a bit too predictable, but there are also moments of poetic beauty in SPD's writing. I'd read another novel written by her, though I'm not sure I'd introduce this novel into my classroom. Perhaps a second read will convince me, though."
1,Not what it seems.,"This charger does not work with the battery depicted. Only works with batteries that have terminals on the bottom, not with side terminals."
2,".bad service, i did not get the item that i ordered, i tried to contact Amazon and the company that shipped the iten, no way of","i ordered and paid for a Craftsman 15.6 volt charger, and recieved a 18.0 volt charger, that would not fit my power drill. i tryed to contact Amazon, no easy way of doing that. i tryed to contact the company that provided the charger, no easy way of doing that! i gave up and have something i can not use, but i did learn one thing from this encounter, DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH COMPANIES THAT YOU CAN NOT TALK TO!!!!! i rate amavon as a absolute zero!"
3,Not the right product I was looking for,"Once I received the package, I knew I ordered the wrong thing. It arrived as promised & was the described accurately. I was the one at fault & luckily I was able to return it to a Sears store near me. I gave it 3 stars, but I am in no position to give it any sort of rating."
2,Charger,The battery charger was as described - ad ststed with Operators Manual - NO MANUAL AND THERE WERE FEATURES I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE - I EMAILED AND THEY STATED THE MANUALS WERE OUT OF STOCK - WHY HAVEN'T I RECEIVED ONE YET - POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I PAID FOR FULL ORDER AND RECEIVED A PARTIAL ORDER
2,not pleased,"this bracelet came broken and i didn't have enough time to buy another one, it was packed very poorly, if it wasn't broken it would have been very pretty, it is quite a bit darker than the picture shows"
4,Great fun accessory,"This bangle is great for casual wear to dress up an outfit for spring or summer. Colour is true to screen display. Note if you have big hands, it may be an effort to get it on (if at all)!"
3,Notable for the title track,"This record may not please latin music or jazz aficionados, but is notable for the title track. ""Thousand Finger Man"" is a house music and dance staple and can reliably put people on the dance floor."
3,one great song and a lot of filler,"I heard the track ""Thousand Finger Man"" on a Blue Note compilation last year and was totally knocked out. Great rhythms and bongos to die for. If some dance act hasn't sampled that one yet I'd be shocked; a groove that will keep you going long into the night. Really, that track is a classic. But as for the rest of this album, it's not bad, just very repetitious and samey sounding. Many of the other songs sound like a reprise of the title track at some point. So, not a lot of variety to be found on this album, but still some insanely infectious conga and bongo playing by Mr. Candido."
2,Time Machine,"This takes you to 1969. Boogaloo craze meets Blue Note records. The band is great but they're just going through the motions here. Candido plays like crazy but he can't do it alone.If you want background music for an ""instrumental sounds of the pyschedelic sixties"" get-together, be sure to have this one on hand. If you want to hear what Candido, the master conga and bongo player, sounded like, try to find ""Brujerias de Candido, Candido's Latin McGuffa's Dust"". I cannot explain the translation of the title, but I can tell you it's got music for dancing and listening, not just rolling around on the floor in a hallucinogen-inspired frenzy."
3,Cool pooh,This charm has a Winnie The Pooh and I like him so he gets one star there. The color is preety good so one more star. They covered most of the charm so you don't see the metal as much one more star.3 stars
5,If your a fan of Oteil Burbridge this is a must have!,"I kind of stumbled on to this CD/DVD set, not knowing what to expect. If you liked hearing Oteil in ""Bass Day 98"" I think you'll enjoy it. The DVD also has a 40 min. Bass Lesson ( more of a question and anwser series)and a commentary with him and musicians involved on this prodject. If you have a DVD rom on your computer you can print the music also. The CD is great! The only way I can describe it is ""Soulfull"".This CD/DVD set offers alot more, and is worth checking out."
4,Play it LOUD!,"I first saw Boss Martians live at a festival 2-3 years ago, and they totally blew the other bands away! Great power/pop/punk attitude. Think Cheap Trick on steroids with some Elvis Costello/Replacements/Paybacks in the mix. Great songwriting and Evan Foster is a SHREDDER on guitar. Top to Bottom this is slightly more solid than their previous effort, ""Making the Rounds"", but I'd give Making the Rounds a slight nod as the best songs are stronger. All in all a GREAT band that's flying just slightly under the radar thought probably not for long. I hear they're in the studio putting together a new album now (Feb 06)."
3,Not as direct as I had hoped,"I bought this book in hopes of improving my lighting skills in 3D Max. So far, it's more informational than instructional. I agree that there are a lot of intriguing images throughout the book, but the content doesn't give enough direction.Still, if you want to learn more about lighting in 3D Max, this book covers more than most books do these days. It WILL tell you why lights react the way they do in your scene, as well as where you should insert your lights in order to render an interesting scene."
2,Disappointed,"Not exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a book that would guide me through the pit falls but what I received was a mish mash of vague ideas and then there were comments like, ""I hope you see that this stuff is great."" It was like reading molasses. Please learn to create outlines and procedural steps. Everything in this book can be learned from online tutorials and the 3DS Max help and tutorial system.If you like pretty pictures you might buy this as a coffee book but don't expect to get any real tips as to how to get up to speed making those images."
3,Basic stuff,An ok book but for me this was very basic stuff and would suit someone starting out in 3d lighting.
3,Lights..camera...?,"This is a good looking book with full color prints. One of the tutorials was highlighted in 3D Magazine as an example of 3 point lighting. I experienced some difficulty with some files when I tried to use the radiosity plugin. Also, one tutorial has missing files. The instructions kind of jumble together in think prose. Not easy to follow. The material, however, touches on light theory, shadows, HDI, and renderers. The HDI tutorial is a good one to introduce you to the concept and yes, HDI maps are included. I think this is a good cocktail table book. Nice discussions and great graphics. Can't take learning specifics about Max lights seriously. But good discussion and some good examples."
2,Fooled by the Size,"This was an attractive pin and lived up to its description, except how small it was. Yes, it is my fault I did not pay closer attention to the size of the pin, but be aware it is tiny. Maybe the size of a quarter. This small size will not work for my intended use so needless to say I am returning it."
1,waste of money,after i got the subs i hooked them up in my blazer come to find out one of the subs were ALREADY BLOWN! i know you get what you pay for but dam atleast give me something that works cuz this aint doing it. my word DO NOT GET THIS P.O.S on the other hand the one kicks hard and it looks good (do to mirror on floor of box) with my neon lights. to save you the trouble and head ach spend the extra 100 get good subs and be happy. looks-8 sound-7 the product- -10 hope this helps you.
4,great for metal or rock music!!,great sounding with heavy rock music. keeps up with every note. its decent with rap but not mind blowing. just know how to tune ur amp and u can have it sound great either way. i would recommend it. enjoy
3,Stargazer,"I'm a fan of Shane Alexander's music since hearing it during an episode of Bones. I was planning on buying an mp3 of my favorite song off this album. I noticed that the songs listed as being on Stargazer are none of the songs that are actually on Stargazer. I was going to purchase ""Shipwrecked"" which is number 9 on the actual track list. I don't know what the screw up is with Amazon's track listing for Stargazer but it certainly doesn't match the track list on Shane Alexander's websites, my space, or cd baby which sells it for $12.97.??????????"
1,Disapointment!!!!,This costume was sooooooo disapointing. First of all its not at all like it looks in the picture...the material was really cheap and very see through...it looked like a worn out night gown that my grandmother would wear and not sexy and suductive as they make is seem in the pictures. very misleading.
1,horrible,This was the most aweful thing I have ever spent money on. I put it on & it was so see through that you could actually see my skin. it was so shear not even a slip would help. I bought it to wear 4 a church function & now I am stuck with this horrible item. DO NOT BUY!!!
3,Very outdated.,"This book was good at it's time, but it's very outdated and the information is not accurate any more. Try looking for Anabolic Review 2003 or 2004 if it exists."
1,Needs updating,"This book is old and out of date. It might have had some value when it came out back in the Stone Age, but now you can get better, more current information for free online."
4,Not bad.,"The only complaint I had was that it was a little short compared to O'Conner's usual work. The relationship that developed between the character was tough and not easily formed, but their story was very heartfelt. I suggest seeing the other high star reviews (they are better written and describe the story much better then I could) as I agree totally with them."
3,oracle wireless doorbell/intercom,"This product works as described. However, there is a big design flaw. You cannot call or talk to the front door unit from the inside intercom system. The outside unit must be activated first, then and only then can you talk to whoever is at the front door. I purchased this for an elderly family member in hopes they would be able to talk to the front door without opening the door even if the visitor rang the original wired bell already existing in the house. This is not the case. The visitor must press the call button on the outside unit in order for the person inside to talk to the person outside. You have 30 seconds to respond or the unit goes into sleep mode and you cannot talk to the front door unless the person outside pushes the call button again. It is a nice unit but the manufacturer needs to address this problem to make it a truly uniqe intercom system."
1,Snell Neuro = As useful as an AOL disk,"I have the major Neuro books, of which Crossman (for overview) and Nolte (for detail) came out on top. Snell's Neuro was very poorly illustrated, typeography made my eyes strain, illustrations were irregularly labelled often missing out the most important aspects, text did not focus on important points, no heirarchy of importance of information. I cannot even in good conscience take someone's money to sell it second-hand, so I think I'll give it to the library. Snell Neuro was money down the drain. At least AOL disks are free."
1,Look elsewhere...,"The diagrams and text seem disjointed. I grew weary after having to turn several pages before finding the diagrams referred to in the text. And after all of that flipping around for the diagrams, the diagrams themselves leave lots to be desired. This title is the required text for my neuroanatomy class, so I'm keeping it, but will look into others to supplement my studies."
3,it is a good book but,The edition review of this book is for the new edition.But generally speaking the snell neuroanatomy is one of the best book.this 1980 edition is good only if you want a picture review of the gross anatomy
4,Very Helpful,This is an awesome and helpful book. The only thing that it is missing is how to sing. I would recommend this to anyone who is shy and wants to develop a much stronger voice.
5,The best $1.00 I ever invested,"I found this CD in $1 Store in Santa Cruz, CA about ten years ago. I had never heard of Tall Stories before, but for $1 I figured it was worth the risk. After listening the first time I was totally disappointed!!! What in the world was a band of this quality doing in a $1 store? I would have loved to have heard more from them and seen them in concert. Unfortunately, Tall Stories turns out to be a sad story about how the music industry is not interested in talented musicians and good music, but rather pretty boys and sexy chicks that can prance around the stage and have a good marketing imagine. While I am happy for the success of Steve Augeri as Journey's new frontman, I am sad for the other members of Tall Stories who never got the recognition they deserve."
4,Cartel 1882,Loved it. I just love Westerns and this was one of the best I've seen in a while. Good acting and just loved the old fat guy. Lots of blood and fighting...my 8 year old will love it!
1,Don't Bother to Buy or Watch,"I have a large collection of DVD movies. I threw this one away directly after my first viewing, not wishing it to fall into the hands of anyone who might waste their time as I had. I can't even tell you what it was about, it was so not good to be remembered."
3,Good but I've liked his others better,"Natural States was a good CD but I preferred others more. True, it has the same melodic qualities as his other music but it just lacked the fire of his other work."
1,Unsatisfied,Seller was very uncooperative when I attempted to contact them about the false book they were advertising. Now I'm stuck with a book I didn't want. I Do NOT recommend and will NOT be doing business with them ever again.
5,Incredible scope,"The depth and breadth of selections makes this book a treasure. It features a wide diversity of pieces, ancient and modern, secular and religious, from many disciplines. What comes through in all the selection is the human drive to pursue ultimate questions and attempt to find ultimate explanations. It pulls together many writers I studied in fragmentary fashion in my philosophy, theology, and science classes. I highly recommend it as a masterful collection of writings."
2,"Overpriced, too little analysis","Ever put on your favourite TV show only to find out they made a ""clip"" episode just full of all the old moments so the episode itself has nothing too new to say? The collection of exerpts are interesting but hardly make it a book."
1,I'm sorry...,"Awesome looking book, but the seller (Amazon.com) sent me a damaged book. I'm pretty disappointed. It had a huge, heavy crease through the entire book. Like several hundred pages of a diagonal, embossed crease. It's as if someone took the entire book, put half of it in an iron clamp, and pulled on the other end."
4,"I disagree w/ the person who wrote on July 8,1999 .","I have not bought this album yet,but I disagree with the music fan from NY,NY who wrote on July 8,1999 . I have bought the other albums of Limite like:Por Puro Amor,Partiendome El Alma,and Sentimientos.I think that Limite is one of the BEST Tex-Mex groups ever.That person should not talk that way about Tex-Mex music because is oviest that as being a Puerto Rican he/she ain't gona like Tex-Mex music.I know that is hard for people from the Caribbean,or Central America to like Tex-Mex.Most of them are gona like merengue or salsa.I don't think he/she should exprese that way about Limite just because they don't like Tex-Mex music."
5,EXCELLENTE,"Para esos que critican a Limite, pues cada quien su gusto. Es logico que si viven en puerto rico, va pegar mas la salsa o merengue, y si vives mas para el este(East) pega mas la musica grupera y tex-mex.Cada region tiene su musica, les aseguro que si vienen a Texas, Colorado, Chihuhua, Durango Etc, la Salsa y merengue no se oye para nada, e igual se rieran y diran que esta bien gacha esa musica.A mi me encanta Limite y su estilo es unico. Pero en Fin CADA QUIEN SU GUSTO, no!"
4,Paralegal now has a clue,"As a paralegal, I assist my supervising attorneys in writing briefs for administrative hearings and federal court. We had a brief due in which we were citing federal law, California Education Code, and a plethora of State-generated publications and web content that were created in response to State and Federal mandates. I had no idea how to format the legal cites for some of our more unusual sources of data. I ordered the ALWD Citation Manual and had it in my hands within days. It was a little confusing to look up which types of cites applied to my materials, though. Some things were pretty easy to figure out, but other things were more cryptic. In the end, we figured it out and it helped us get our brief out on time and properly formatted."
3,Good Book . . . Bad Binding,"I'm currently a second year law student and member of my school's Law Review. I can say from first-hand experience that ALWD is an excellent citation manual. However, the binding is very weak. Mine started to fall apart after about 3 weeks of use last year. The same was true for a number of my classmates. I oftentimes transported the book in my backpack and I'm sure it got jostled around a bit. However, it seems like the publisher should have designed the book to withstand this type of wear and tear when one considers that law students constitute such a large market for the text.I would love to see ALWD publish a hardback version of the third edition. I'd be the first in line to purchase it, even if the cost was a bit higher than that of the spiral-bound version.Perhaps our school bookstore simply got a batch of ALWDs with substandard bindings. Have any other ALWD purchasers experienced similar problems with the bindings on their manuals? Feel free to comment."
2,ALWD Book is irrelevant,"This book may be a fine book if one wants to laboriously learn how to do legal citation, but why would one want to when they dont have to? There is a software product on the market, CiteIt! that automates everything this book teaches. Simply type in the info and CiteIt! automatically places it in ALWD or Bluebook format.This software has done to this manual what spell check did to the dictionary. OBSOLETE."
2,Fine but ......,"This is a fine book, however with programs like CiteIt! I am not sure why you would buy it unless it was required or something. I used CiteIt! through my legal citation/writing class and never got a point off on any citation excercises, which game me far more time to concentrate on my writing.My whole class used it. I would like to know what problems the reviewer below had with this program. Oh I know they teach legal citation and this program puts them out of a job. ;)"
5,Excellent Manual,I aprecciate this manual. I think tha it's a necessary tool for every lawyer. I don't go anyway without my citation manual.
1,Flopping like New Coke,"While I agree in principle that a citation book should be readable and easy to use, I find ALWD to be decidedly useless in the real practice of law. Although forced to purchase the book as a 1L, I have to meet an attorney, judge or legal scholar that uses it or would like it to replace the Bluebook. In fact, during a firm interview, the attorney and I joked that we would like to start an anti-ALWD club to prevent 1Ls from being tricked into preferring ALWD over Bluebook. Sorry ALWD."
2,What a struggle!,"I know citation is a difficult concept, but this book didn't help me at all. It was required for my 1L writing class. I struggled with this book all year to find the proper citation instructions. The layout and headings were difficult to follow."
3,Adequate,Our professor required this manual because he is one of the authors. It's a citation manual. Quite unremarkable. It's adequate.
1,Choose something else,"I have had this model for five months. Actually, I have had it for three months because it has been sent back to be repaired twice. The VCR has stopped recording and playing both times. Hopefully, they will get it fixed or replace it this time. I would not make this purchase again. Dec.21. It's official. The machine has been in the shop for more time than I have had it. First repair was under warranty but not the second because it was beyond 90 day labor. The repair will cost $64.20 plus shipping. You guessed it, I'm pissed. Right now I'm on hold and have been for the last twenty minutes. Merry Christmas"
5,So Far So Good,Have had product a little over a month and so far so good. Has alot of features and is easy to use and setup. Upconverts to 1080i and seems to make all those old vhs tapes look alot better. The fact that is does not have a tuner is not a factor for me. I would recommend this product!
3,Samsung DVD-VR357,"This item is good, but it has no direct cable connector, so I have to use my old VCR to connect to the cable and use that old VCR output as DVD-VR357's input.Otherwise, it works fine."
2,JUNK!!!!,"Following is my first review, I am forced to amend it.THE THING PLAYS NO DISKS!! A DVD PLAYER THAT WONT PLAY DISKS IS JUNK! There has been no abuse and only moderate use.I have found many glitches with this unit. Mostly it works fine, great even, but sometimes it refuses to play a disk for no good reason, or it will give only audio output. I have seen a few error messages on-screen that were bothersome also.I like it, when it works."
2,Weak DVD player.,"I thought it would be convenient to have a DVD player, DVD recorder, and VHS all in one cheap machine so I could save space in my house and not have to buy multiple machines. Turns out I STILL have to get another DVD player because this dumb thing doesn't recognize a number of DVDs still. I have a lot of Region 0 DVD's that don't work at all on this machine. Usually any DVD player should be able to play a Region 0 DVD release. VCD's (which usually every DVD player can play, even my old one did) do not work at all on this machine either. The VHS to DVD copying is the only thing it has a practical use for, cause it's one lousy DVD player."
1,Did Not Work,The unit would not record or play DVDs. Samsumg determined that it needed a firmware update. It took 3 weeks to get the disk to do the update - and that didn't work! Damsung wouldn't replace the unit but offered to repair it - meaning I would have to take it to a repair center a wait to get a repaired unit rather than a new unit. Fortunately Amazon agreed to replace it and the new one is OK. But I'm not happy for having to go through the agrivation I went through.
3,Just about worthless.,"When it works, it does a great job, but I've had this one less than 6 months and it already has problems loading blank disks. I've had to retry anywhere from 2 to 4 times before it would load one for recording. Then there's the problem with it freezing up without warning, and the only way to get it to do anything is to unplug it because none of the buttons will work on either the machine or the remote. By then anything which has not been updated to the disk is lost, including the disk space (if it freezes while paused for example). It also has a habit of stopping about 20 minutes into any dvd you're watching. Remote is cheaply made and tends to break easily...especially if it falls against the wall right after spending over an hour working on a dvd, and the machine freezes up.I'm open to suggestions about how to stop these problems if anyone has any ideas. I'm sure the remote wont fall against the wall anymore if the freezing up problem is solved."
1,Avoid,Item never worked for copying vcr to dvd.The DVD stopped working entirely after 6 months.The VCR stopped working after 9 months.Avoid this item!
1,Junk - Stay Away,"I purchased this item in October 2007. The first unit arrived with a dead remote control. That was replaced and the very lightly used unit worked well enough until this month. Now any disk returns a ""This disc cannot be played. Please check disc."" error. The same error noted by several other reviews."
1,STOP -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MACHINE!,"Shoppers beware - I wish I had been warned about this product.There is something wrong with the design on this model. I say this because I have plenty of Samsung electronics that function perfectly well, so I know the company's products are generally sound. It's this particular model that is the problem. My first VR-357 deteriorated right from the beginning, eventually losing the ability to record onto dvd altogether. Samsung was unable to repair that machine, so they sent me a reconditioned recorder, same model - and right away it was clear that it had the same exact problems as my first recorder! Please believe me, this model is a headache that you don't need. Do yourself a favor and give this one a PASS."
4,Trouble recording tv programs,"Bought the 357 a week ago and have not been able to figure out why it wont allow recording tv shows. We can watch movies, and we can transfer vhs to dvd but we cannot record anything from tv on to dvd. WE have hd cables one going from tv to cable box and one going from tv to dvd player. 357 does not have coaxil connection to connect to cable box so what other cable should we have to make proper connections? If its not a connection problem might we be making the wrong choices on the programmed menu? Thanks for any input. We want to love it - but not there yet."
2,VCR stopped working,"* VCR stopped working after 3.5 years or so* VCR: Sometimes the cassette tapes get ejected* VCR: Sometimes they play, but the magnetic tape gets stuck* DVD: still plays, occasionally there's a region or format issue"
1,Piece of junk - Bought several and all had same problem,"I bought 2 of these recorders - one for upstairs and one for downstairs. The VCR works great and it seems to play DVD's OK. But after several months, the DVD recorder freezes while recording which ruins the blank DVD. Both of the Samsung units did this and I returned them. The new, replacement units did the same thing after a few months. I am shopping for a new recorder and won't be buying Samsung again."
1,100% Junk,"This worked great----for about 3 months. Now, it won't play half the time and when it does, the DVDs skip, stop for no reason, etc. When we place the DVDs on our other DVD player, they all work fine. Also, IF by chance the DVD decides to play, this player takes a LONG time to finally play. Even brand new movies fresh out of the box won't play on this thing one day and will play fine the next. DO NOT buy this item, spend you money on something else."
1,piece of junk dont waste your time or money,this player never quite qorked well and I returned it several times to get one that worked. When it did work it never really recorded properly and now the DVD player just will not work at all. Its basically a $200 vhs player. What a waste. Samsung will not do anything to fix the problem either. They said they were sending firmware to me and never did. Horrible service.
1,Beware - Beware:,I purchased this DVD Recorder on January 15 2008. From the start it was very noisy when turned on. This should have been a clue of what was to come. In about two months it would just not play at all. Then it would and then not and so on. I have read the nightmare repair problems so I let it go. Now it has not worked for five days. I am not sure what I will do now but I am not happy. So DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.
1,What a pile of doodie !,Samsung DVD-VR375 Combo unit is total crap. Worked fine for 8 months. I didn't buy a warranty. I sure hope I got my moneys worth out of it....I recorded 10 old family home movies off VHS before it failed. I really hate living in this world of disposable electronics. JUNK !
2,I had to return the product,"It may be a good product, I'll never know. When we opened the box, there was no user manual. Now, I know I can download and print it out, but it was 88 pages of printing. When I phoned Samsung to ask them to send us a manual, the lady said it's Samsung's policy not to send out manuals. So, we were left with either buying a manual or returning the recorder, so we returned the recorder to the store. Don't think we will be buying a Samsung product again."
4,So far so good,Received product fast and so far so good with regards to functionality. I haven't tried burning anything yet but I'll review that soon. Do wish it had a built-in tuner though. I kept my other Samsung DVD/VCR connected so I could tape shows on TV because it has a tuner. I chose this method versus buying optional cable and configuring unit to work with my cable box. I may connect it solo in the future but now its fine with the two connected together.
1,PIECE OF JUNK GLAD I BOUGHT IT AT AMAZON,THE DVD RECORDER / VCR COMBO WAS A PIEC OF JUNK AFYER A WEEK OF USING IT THE DVD PLAYER STARTED MAKING ODD NOISES AND WOULD HAVE SKIPPING IN THE PLAYBACK. IT DID THIS WITH BOTH RECORDED DVDS AND REGULAR MOVIES. THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT AMAZON HAD NO PROBLEM WITH ME RETURNING IT AND GETTING MY MONEY BACK. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE
4,Really good value,"This DVD/VCR recorder does a good job of transferring formats back and forth. One big problem: we just want to change our kids' old Disney VHS into DVDs and it won't permit it. ""Copy protected""Other than that, a really great value."
3,Unsure of product support,"After a month, it lost the color from its video output, both composite and S-vid. Sent it back to Samsung (my shipping $$), but they returned it to me with same problem, unfixed--said it performed properly. So I returned it to Amazon and got another one--works OK so far. No other brand has the feature set I want for this good a price, so I thought I'd chance it again. To be fair, Samsung did offer to look at it a second time, and to pay for the second shipping to them. Too late, and too much trouble."
2,"Well it worked, for a while - annoying remote control","Very annoying remote. The tiny buttons are in very inconvenient spots and you have to press them VERY hard to make them work. I spotted one at a neighbor's and she had the same complaint.The DVD worked fine for about 11 months, then a DVD got stuck in the drive during a write operation. I could not get it to eject. Took it to Best Buy Geek Squad and they removed it for me free, but wanted $75 to make the door open and close again. And who knows if it still worked! The VCR lives on.I spent another month trying to find anything to prove its still in warranty, so now in the 12th month, I am stuck. I ordered a new Toshiba today and will guard the paperwork this time......"
4,Works as advertised,"I connect this to a computer monitor via hdmi-dvi cable. I like it bevcause it has play all my divx videos. I have only burned one VHS to DVD and it worked fine, IT did use a cd-R just because of all the reviews about +R's not working. I have yet to try to burn a DVD from my camcorder, but I think it will be just fine. I did need to get a DV-DV cable in order to try when I get the time. I got the cable from monoprice for $3.70 shipped."
4,"Good value, but HDMI difficulties","I've had this combo player for a month now, and overall it's a good unit. The recoding in VCR mode is good, and the DVD recordings are excellent. Playback in both modes is fine except for a problem with the HDMI output that I still haven't resolved. I can get the HDMI video to work just fine while displaying the setup menu, but every time I try to play a DVD, the screen goes black (the sound works fine). My workaround was to hook up the component outputs instead--the video looks quite good this way, but may have been slightly better using HDMI."
3,Does what I need,"This recorder does what I need it to do, but isn't really compatible with my TV. I wanted this to copy home video to DVD. I find I need to use another VCR as an intermediate step. Perhaps when I become more familiar with this recorder, I will be able to cut out this step, but right now it is a problem. This recorder is not the easiest to use. The recorder I had to do this job was much easier to use before it declined to work at all."
1,Piece of junk.,"This item is so cheap...I plan to return it ASAP. I bought it for a gift, but wouldn't even take it to a ""white elephant"" party! The packaging was horrible and it arrived completely bent...I don't think there is any way to make it even look DECENT."
2,Some of the disks are duplicates,"We returned our first set of CD's and found that the second set still wasmissing the first 6 segments/chapters of the radio series. The first disk of the 6 disk set was a duplicate of a subsequent disk. It was not worth trying to return it a second time. While Amazon.com was very helpful in guiding us through the return process, we did not receive the product that was advertized. Whoever did the copying of the disks did not do a very good job of quality control. We will try to get a copy of the first 6 episodes another way. This product did not deliver! This was a gift for my husband who remembers this radio show. I was disappointed and embarasses that I gave him an incomplete set."
4,30 amp Thermo-Magnetic Breaker,"I ordered this for a custom build load center for my 6KW generator. I needed a panel mount 30 amp breaker and this seemed to fit. I read the rating information on the side and is says it trips at 40.5 amps at 34 seconds (this is typical for thermo-magnetic breakers). This will work for short control, but not for generator protection (for that I need to trip at 30 amp instantly).Other than needing the next lower size for what I intended it seems to be a very good product. The load and line connections are stainless steel with stainless screws as most of the internals seem to be. If one side trips the other trip automatically. It comes with 2 types of screws for panel mounting.The description could have been more informative of the actual function. Overall, a quality product."
3,THE POOL,"WAS DISAPOINTED NOT MUCH NUDITY, MOSTLY YOUNG MEN IN THEIR 20'S ENJOYING THE PRIVACY OF A POOL"
1,Bianchi is such a wasted talent,"I used to respect Tom Bianchi as a visionary photographic talent. Now he's just a glorified pornographer peddling his wares are ""art"". This is a truly disapointing turn for someone who could have been among the ranks of Herb Ritts, etc.This film does nothing for either art or porn. It's really just a bad attempt at self proclamation on Bianchi's part."
2,Interesting but not complete,The author apparently has not adequately appreciated that (1) computers were not invented but gradually and continuously evolved since the first: the abacus; and that (2) the following two books should have deserved more attention: (2.1) Herman H.Goldstine: THE COMPUTER FROM PASCAL TO [JOHN] VON NEUMANN (1993); and (2.2) William Aspray: JOHN VON NEUMANN AND THE ORIGINS OF MODERN COMPUTING (1992).
1,Unfortunately based on incorrect information,"This book, as well as the many tales of the ENIAC, are factually incorrect. This was even proven by a federal judge in the state of Minnesota.On October 19, 1973, US Federal Judge Earl R. Larson signed his decision following a lengthy court trial which declared the ENIAC patent of Mauchly and Eckert invalid and named Atanasoff the inventor of the electronic digital computer -- the Atanasoff-Berry Computer or the ABC.Mr. McCartney does a great job of ignoring the facts that were proven in the case,and instead believes the hearsay, and tarnished depositions that were later recanted."
5,My Thoughts,"I am a 10th grade student doing a school project on early computers. (ENIAC, The Atanasoff-Berry Computer, the Turing Machine, etc.) I found this book exremely helpful, especially for someone who is interested in the history of computers, but have nowhere to start, I recommend this book. Mr. Mcartney is a very talented writer, with an exellent grasp of history, and offers an unbiased view into the controversial subject of the inventor of the computer."
4,First class history of the dawn of the electronic computer,"The real fun begins after Mauchly and Eckert and their team build ENIAC. All of the characters in a great drama come together in this fascinating story of what happened after ENICA began to crunch numbers in quick time. If you want the real low down on conniving university administrators, unprincipled selfeserving academics, greedy corperations, and a legal system which applies linear thinking to 20th century problems, this is the place to learn a great deal about it. It is fascinating to follow what happened to Mauchly and Eckert and to recognize that events, such as those described in this interesting book, were characterized by the Greeks centuries ago"
3,Not the first computer,"The 'World's First Computer' is misleading, giving the impression that Eniac was, in fact, the 'World's First Computer'. It wasn't. The Abacus has existed for centuries. Babbage built a 'calculating engine' that he had first described in 1837.The first 'electronic computer' was Colossus, built by the British to break the Nazi enigma code. For many years the American ENIAC was considered the world's first electronic computer. Recently, however, the governments of the UK and the US have declassified and released papers relating to Colossus. Most Historians now agree that Colossus was --in fact --the world's first electronic computerAnd lest we forgot: it worked and the allies won the war."
2,Disappointing... could have been a magazine article,"This should have been a long magazine article, not a $23 book. That's not to say the topic, the creation/invention of the first computer, isn't deserving of a historical, scientific book-length examination. It certainly is. But this book isn't it. It lacks detail, historical context and a discussion of the implications of the invention and what it meant to the era in which it was created. There were many places where I wondered why the author didn't go just a few paragraphs further, explaining key details to us or telling us stories. Instead we get a recitation of events. For example, he mentions that it was hard for the ENIAC project to get parts. OK, tell us why and how they got them. Instead we get a sentence or two. I feel like there was a story to be told here and it was merely outlined."
2,First Computer?,"Ok, heres the deal. Calling ENIAC the first digital computer is not a fair statement. You could call the Attonasoff-Beffy Computer(ABC) the fist digital computer or Colossus the first digital computer, but not ENIAC. The fist computer in a modern sense was the Manchester Mark 1, by saying modern I mean a computer that can store its program. By the way I have not read this book."
4,What about Collosus?,"I haven't read this book so can't review it. However, it appears the book may have been written before the cryptanalysis done at Bletchley Park was declassified. Wasn't Collosus built before ENIAC? If so, doesn't credit for the first computer belong to Flowers and Turing?"
3,Not his best effort.,This album doen't compare to the likes of 'Yakety Sax' or Boots with the Knightbridge strings. I'm not sure if something is missing or too much of a good thing. The material is good but the sax in not in your face as his sax usually is. Somewhat subdued. Very short album.
3,Photogenic Acting,"This movie show how these two attractive sisters can make a entertaining film that is good for more than just soft porn .... itake that, back for $2 or $3 it serves as good ,cheap, soft porn , thanks girls ;)"
1,Not as Pleasant as Getting Your Wisdom Teeth Pulled.,"I really wanted to like this movie because I think the Duff sisters are cute and actually have some potential. This movie has nothing about it to offer additional points to that train of thought. Hilary and Hayley are two spoiled brats who lose all their money, then get it back--an obvious parody of the ditzola factor the Hilton sisters live for real. About as painful, stupid and empty as My Date with the President's Daughter (UGH!), the only redeeming thing about this vapid little teen chick flick is Anjelica Houston. For good teen flicks that are thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend 10 Things I Hate About You and the old 80s classic hit, John Hughes' Sixteen Candles. Where this movie is concerned, I wouldn't recommend it to your dog's fleas."
2,Duffs really are Material Girls,"Material Girls really is about the Duff sisters. Yes, they are beautiful, can act, and Hilary Duff can sing. This movie could be funny if there was some originality,but there isn't. Hilary Duff needs to get in touch with her inner ""Lizzie McGuire."" She is no longer charming and cute. That's really a shame. Lizzie McGuire was lovable. Hilary Duff is not."
3,Hilary Flopped,"I saw this movie in the threatre and was sort of surprised at some scenes. It didn't seem like a kid's movie, more like a teen chick flick.I was really surprised when Haylie Duff said a bad word in the movie. This movie is OKAY.I wouldn't mind seeing it again, but it's kind of stupid. I'd save your money on something worth buying."
2,Not the best :-l,"While I'm not a teen anymore, I still like to watch the occasional movie in this 'genre' (ones that appeal to the tween market) and I do normally like Hilary Duff but this was NOT GOOD.Hilary was OK in this, but her sister was annoying. There were the odd funny moments here and there. The plot was OK (two rich kids lose their money and become broke, yet bounce back into riches again). It was mostly unbelievable, yet kind of cute if you are of the age that this was intended for. I think kids would like this, but I found it to be only average."
3,Not Worth Buying!!!,"I rented this movie yesterday from Blockbuster and I was'nt that impressed. It was alright but it was'nt great! I thought it would have been a bit more interesting. It's kinda like the movie Cowbelles on Disney Channel. It's pretty much based on the same idea. Two sisters who's family owns a major company, and they become poor and get rich again. If you're looking for a good movie, I would recommend Step Up. Now thats a movie worth watching!"
1,No wonder I had never heard of this movie...,"I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half of my life on this. This movie is dumb and trashy. I wish I could say that Hilary redeems it, but she doesn't. She seems very out of place in such an empty, mindless flick. Maybe she's doing the ususal child-star thing of ""Look, I'm older now, and I'm going to make edgier movies..."" I can't imagine that working for her.If you want to see Hilary at her best, see ""Raise Your Voice""."
3,A good effort but....,"3 stars for effort.This ALMOST was a good movie. I thought for sure it would be good because usually riches to rags stories are. (Just my luck"" was cute, I thought.)This went nowhere, then DIED in the middle.Although the IDEA was good, the story flopped, and this is why.Whoever edited it did a bad job. It was choppy, and a lot of it seemed FORCED.Certain scenes seemed totally out of synch.ALSO, It was more Haylie's debut film, and Hillary was sort of just thrown in there...and truth is, I really don't care for Haylie Duff.But all stars try getting thier sisters in, I guess.Britney did it with Jamie Lynn, Lindsay Lohan is trying to get her sis Ali in, and so on...Anyway, had there been better editing, and the focus wasn't so much on Haylie, it could have been a good movie. The IDEA was good, but that is where it ended.Maybe worth a rental but not a buy."
4,Good movie,"This movie is not bad. This movie actually is quite relaxing to watch and quite funny as well. For the story, it is just like a regular comedy movie story type. So, it is satisfactory. For the acting, this is the best part. It is because Hilary Duff and Haylie Duff really shine in this movie. I also think that they are absolutely fitting the roles of Tanzie Marchetta and Ava Marchetta. For the direction, they are quite logical. For the visuals, it is perfect. It is because for the DVD, this movie is made with 2:40.1 widescreen formats, which is a good surprise for me. Therefore, it is always a good visual effect to see in this kind of widescreen version. For the music and sound effects, they are good as well. Overall, it is a good movie and I like it."
2,How unfun,"Starts out with a horrible version of the song Material Girl and gets worse and worse. Lame acting, very lame, nothing is believable, especially the ending which didn't even make sense to me, so how could the two clutzes figure it out? This movie was a parody of paris hilton's life I assumed. In the extras the two sisters talked about making the movie fun and zany, but it wasn't at all--let's go people, how hard can it be to make a funny crazy movie - especialy with your own sister. OH well, it's worth a rent only to laugh hysterically at the bad acting and plot."
1,Actually became a little boring through the middle !,"I was actually very dissappointed in the movie ! The acting seemed a little forced and very predictable. Although from the previews I wasn't all that surprised! The writing was just average. There were a few cute scenes but just not enough to save the movie. The jokes began to suffer mid-way through the movie. It was like watching Paris Hilton on the Simple life -- can these girls really be this stupid? I don't know, I became a little bored. I would suggest renting this movie, it really is not worth $30 at the movies it cost to take my 2 girls."
2,Duff Fluff for the Cinematically Challenged,"Wow, sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff co-starring together in the `06 film `Material Girls' [let me catch my breath]! I can almost see their agent shopping this one to MGM. Hilary's a pretty hot commodity right now with a hit television show under her belt and movies galore and Haylie was in that big hit `Napoleon Dynamite.' What could be more perfect?A lot of things I think. Yes the Duff's are attractive, that I'll admit, but this film is sooo predictable, and cliché, spoiled rich kids go from mega wealth, to dirt poor, to wealth again. Gee.. how original is that? I have to wonder why the girls even bothered. The only plausible answer is the Olson twins must have been unavailible. All kidding aside, if you're a little girl twelve or under you'll love it."
3,good grips with some effort on your part,For the money this is a good set of replacement grips for the Dan Wesson 357mag model 15. However its gonna take a little modification and some patience to get the original screw to work. Had to use a drill bit to make the set hole in the grip a little deeper. A good set of grips though once you get it to work
3,Not good enough,"Hogues are usually great, but steer clear of these. The screw holes don't line up and are improperly sized. A 30-second swap job was turned into a 2 hour headache of fitting and shimming."
4,One of the best books about the spanish bullfight,"Lewine is a very good reporter and storyteller. Armed with wit and grace, he dares enter the difficult world of the Spanish bullfight and exits with wonderful insights about Spain and its bullfighting tradition. Lewine's keen observations are rarely found in an english-language book. This book is a pleasure."
5,"A terrific survey of the art, history, culture, and business of bullfighting","""Death and the Sun"" is a terrific book that fully captures the experience of being at Spanish bullfights. The author has followed one bullfighter throughout his ""season"" and writes compellingly about the personal, family, business, celebrity, and bullfighting aspects of this torero's life. He also explains very clearly the role of bullfighting in Spanish culture and history, and its sports business aspects---running a bull ring, bull ranches, costuming, keeping an 11 person crew on the road for eight months a year, etc. This book is beautifully written and at many points reads like a thriller!"
5,Perfect Solution,"I teach group fitness classes, and the cord from the mic belt to the headset always caught my arm at the worst time. This was a simple and elegant solution to my problem. Very easy to clip the cord to the back of my shirt and now I have no problems!"
3,Plantronic clip,"Item was shipped and received as promised. Item, however, did not meet my needs. I didn't know the attachment for the cable could be different sizes and it was too small for holding the wire. It would be helpful to state which types of earpiece could use this clip."
1,Worthless,"Not only is this clip unable to hold the wire, it's too small and flimsy to wrap tape around. The part where the wire goes is loose, and most wires are too big to fit into it, while smaller mp3 headphone wires are too small and slip right through.A binder clip is better than this worthless trash. Save your money and get a 100 pack of binder clips instead."
4,Very helpful,I always hate how the earphone cables get in the way when I run. This doesn't completely solve the problem but it is quite helpful.
4,This is a great little tote...,This is not to big for me and it fits so well around my arm. I use it for work. Thinking about embroidering the logo of my company on it.
5,GREAT BAGS!!!,I ordered these bags for my Bridesmaids. I was pleaseantly suprised from the price how sturdy and durable they were! I even had them embroidered - my ladies loved them!
5,The perfect tote!,"I bought this tote, actually bought 6 of them. For a women's conference at church and gave them to all my family that came. It was perfect! All 6 girls LOVED them. The size was perfect, and the strap stayed on our shoulders, and it's true to color. we were able to carry our personal items, plus our Bibles, note books, and a small sweater. Other women also stopped to ask where I got the totes! When I am ready for a few more totes I will be purchasing this one again. I now use it for grocery runs, or carrying the toddlers and baby's things to and from Mimi's house... AWESOME!"
1,Saddened,"I was gutted to find I was sent 1 bag instead of 4 I had ordered. Then was shocked to see I was charged $26 for postage on a $3.50 light as anything bag, and in comparison a large box of wooden hangers I'd purchased elsewhere cost me $14 for delivery - ripped off :(I attempted to resolve this via Amazon and this company as I believe each to be at fault but no luck. I guess I will use paper bags for my bridesmaids in my wedding in March :("
4,Great tote for the price!,"We ordered these totes in 3 different colors as gifts for a bridal shower. Everyone really liked them. The totes are perfect for running errands, grocery, etc. The fabric is thin though, so don't expect the thick canvas of other totes (LL Bean, Land's End, etc.)."
4,A handy tote!,"Well constructed. We have about 6 of these totes and use them all of the time for carrying groceries. They definitely can carry a good deal of weight so you can stuff them full without having to worry. Some stores will give you a refund for bring your own bags, but that isn't really the point. Don't know what else to say - it's a quality canvas bag at a good price."
2,Expensive Blank Book,"I've bought a lot of 'blank journals' over the years and some as much or more as the $19.95 I paid for this book when it first came out, but I knew that I was buying a blank journal. In this case I thought I was buying something with a little more substance.This book is basically a large blank book with some colorful drawings throughout and several pages with a few words written to give you suggestions of what to fill the pages with, but even the words are very simplistic and don't offer much in the way of prompts.It was a huge disappointment and in my opinion a waste of twenty dollars."
5,SARK is magical,"This journal and playbook has opened me up in more ways than i could have imagined. It is amazing and perfect for souls of any age, and i highly recommend it."
5,THIS BOOK IS FUN!,"I am a full time college student and so is my roommate. We both just purchased this book and love it! It is so much fun coloring in it with markers, adding stickers, etc., just like when we were kids. But, it's more than that, this journal inspires you and lifts your spirits. It has helped our self esteem plenty. Also, we love taking ""Sark Breaks"" and working on our journals. I'd recommend this book for almost any age from kids to grandmas!"
3,Pages not thick enough,"I like the many huge blank pages left empty for me to fill. However, I was a little disappointed to see that the pages are kind of thin for certain markers. see, I was used to using these markers in my previous journal. I found that my previous journal has thicker and much better quality paper...and you must be used to Sark's writings in capital letters (most of the time), which may sometimes appear to be shouting out from the book :)"
4,~ Positive energy ~,"SARK is weird. This book is odd. And fun and great and unusual and full of positive energy. The pages are pretty blank, so if you want a psychobabble self-help book, this ain't it. It's a JOURNAL, and the author encourages YOU to write about YOUR LIFE: happy things, scary things, dreams . . . And she prompts you to look at situations in your life from a positive light. The handwritten pages have ideas at the top and bottom to get you writing: How have you amazed yourself? What are your favorite books? What unusual private things do you enjoy doing? Design your own special dream space. Live juicy! It's calming, encouraging, and if some of the pages you don't want to do, don't. I'm sure SARK wouldn't mind."
5,"Sublime fans, ska fans, and anyone who likes NEW ideas","If you have not listened to the Ziggens yet then this is the album to buy. If you liked Sublime you might like The Ziggens. The Ziggens were a major influence in Sublime's music and can be heard in some of their songs. I am a major sublime fan and I just bought this CD 3 weeks ago and it has not come out of my CD player since. It is really an amazing blend of so many different types of music but they do it in their own way. Most of the songs make you feel like surfing, especially the songs on the Surf CD. I have never surfed but this is the music I would listen to if I was going surfing. There is also a lot of punk rock in thier music as well as country, polka and some other things I don't know how to describe. You really have to buy this CD it's awesome. PLUS, it's impossible to download, I tried. Don't even bother I never buy CD's but I bought this one because it's impossible to download. Overall Rating - A++++"
3,a student's perspective,"This book contains a lot of information for the beginning/intermediate learner of motor speech disorders. However, is not very easy to read. It can be dry and more wordy than need be."
5,Best book for motor speech disorders.,Duffy presents a comprehensive and cogent overview of motor speech disorders using the 'Mayo' classification system. This book is intellectually satisfying and a scholarly work of the highest order. The revision only improves on the first edition. A classic.
5,We should drag every President kicking into the White House!,A very well written novel about a 3rd generation colonist from Titan. He attends the Quincitennial in Washington. While there he finds a lost love and reveales her secrets. He also decides to carry on the family line.Clarke does an excellent job depicting the future in this brilliant novel. Personally I loved it.
3,Allright,The story of a third generation Jovian colonist and his first and only visit he could make to earth.As usual Clarke is a master at the tech side of Science Fiction. Very imagative when it comes to technology but kind of slow sometimes boring when it comes to an interesting story. The title is decieving and has very little to do with any Empire. Worth reading mostly because of the future innovations Clark imagines.
3,"Sometimes fascinating, sometimes mundane","As geese are currently no longer bothering to migrate in my neck of the woods, I looked forward to Heinrich's insights into the realm of my feathered neighbors. When I read A YEAR IN THE MAINE WOODS, I was intrigued by Heinrich's examinations of the natural world, but found myself occasionally bored by his writing style; and THE GEESE OF BEAVER BOG suffers from a similar fate. Heinrich has a tendency to focus on the mundane, details like the time and date are used over and over, appropriate perhaps for a journal, but tedious in this setting. His personal connection to the geese is endearing, and the examination of the behavior of nesting geese is often fascinating, but I still found my mind wandering as the general dryness of the descriptions just becomes a bit tedious. I think my biggest problem here is personal; I know that this writer knows so much and I wish he would share it in a manner that I could find compelling instead of just mildly interesting."
5,Best performance ever,"As some of the reviwers said I also agree that this is the best performance of the TWC. I don't know if Bach would concieve the speed and magical colors that Richter achieves but Bach is a box of of surprises and if you've got the the talent you can find it all; this is what Richter is able to do. And he shares with us Bach's possibilities, and show us that he (Bach) is the the Master of all ages."
5,Exquisite,Listen to this album a lot. It is exquisitely played by Richter and a beautiful collection of pieces by Bach.
4,Molto bene - ma....,"I very much enjoy this recording. It's one of the more listenable WTC's as Sviatoslav - galvanised-steel-fingers - Richter is playing on the edge of his remarkable abilities. And very musically at that, too. He really forges the WTC into one of the highlights of musical unity. Drawback is the far from perfect sound quality, but that should never EVER prevent one from buying this album.Remember though, there is more to the WTC than Richter's interpretation. I began to fully appreciate the pieces when I had listened to the Gould and Perahia-sets as well. And the definitive recording? There is no. And there will not be."
2,Richter gives great WTC but not on this recording,"Sviatoslav Richter brings his superb technique and penetrating musical intelligence to bear on the WTC and the result may not please scholars but it is deeply enjoyable (which is probably what Bach had in mind). Unfortunately the sound on these recordings is abominable. After listening for more than a couple of minutes I give up. I think it is the fault of the original recording in an over reverberant acoustic but there is a constant ""aura"" which really gets in the way. There is a far better and consistently more exciting version recorded in Innsbruck in the early 70s but it is only available in a CD version on ""Polo"" which is published in China. Presumably RCA Victor has problems with the dissemination of this version in the West! It's not a perfect recording by any means but it is far more listenable."
3,"It's Bach and Richter, but the recording quality....","I love this music and Sviatoslav Richter is one of my favorite classical artists, but the quality of this recording is horrible and is so bad that the quality of both the performance (excellent!) or of the works themselves (wonderful!) can not be overcome by the quality of the sound."
2,Poorly written,"I felt like I was reading an essay someone wrote in the eleventh grade. The story of Hans and his life seemed interesting, but the writing was so poor, it was a struggle to read the entire book. Too bad!"
3,Wouldn't recommend,"I read this book at the suggestion of a friend. Although the plot was interesting, it couldn't keep my attention. I prefer Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series to this. I will not read any more of Kate White's books for the simple fact that I can't get into them as well."
2,Stilted writing,"The premise of this book is good, but the writing style is choppy and the characters are unappealing. Despite Bailey saying she's not ready for a relationship she seems desperate to jump into bed with the detective and her ex-boyfriend. And for a journalist, her questioning definitely lacks finesse. The characters aren't portrayed in a sympathetic manner so it's hard to care who killed the victims or that the spa owner's business is being destroyed by the murders. In the hands of a better writer, this could have been a great story."
1,totally unengaging,"I read half way through and then gave up, not even enough interested to look at the end to find out whodunit. What turned me off were the non-existent sexual morals of the protagonist."
3,Hated the ending,"I enjoyed this book, though not half as much as I enjoy writers Marcia Muller and Sue Grafton. Bailey Weggins is a likeable character, though, and it was a fun summer read. I liked that the characters were complicated people. There were times when I couldn't put the book down. Until the ending, that is. While I won't give it away, the ending was a huge disappointment. The motive and the murderer were totally not believable."
1,Mediocre,The author gives more (too much more) empahasis to the protagonist's person life than the mystery element in the story.And this makes the book a drag and like a bad version of Bridget Jones' Diary. By the middle of the book one totally loses interest in who committed the murder. There is no nail-biting suspense nor a feeling of impending doom one may associate with a mystery novel. This also does not say much about the story-telling ability of the author.The stoty opens in a spa and the novel somehow does not cash in on the glamour element which could have made the book more interesting but rather makes any spa look as interesing as cardboard. None of the characters are well developed (not even the heroine's whose personal life shoud be of absolute disinterest to the readers) and story proceeds in a meandering style going everywhere and touching nothing.I would say skip it.
2,Don't bother....,"Don't bother spending any time with this book. It lacks everything--suspense, good character development, good writing. You know who ""done"" it in the first few chapters and you really don't care about any of the characters because the author has done such a poor job of developing them. She should go back to Cosmo."
4,"Great concept, and visually striking.","Bikinis and fishing? When I first ordered the video I didn't know quite what to expect, but I've wound up watching it over and over! Mixing models and big game fishing is a great idea, and this video does it without being tacky. My guy friends love it, but so do my girlfriends! Go figure!"
3,Good Book,"If you are looking for a deep intellectual book, you will not find it in Kiss Me, Creep. However, it is a very adorable, fun, fast, and easy read. I personally would recommend it for People ages 11-14 years old. It's a very cute book!"
4,First Impressions Can Be Deceiving,"Thus is a very nice book about two teens who fall in love. They hate each other at first, but quickly discover that appearances are not all there is to a person and that their first imperssions of each other were quite inaccurate."
5,Nothing more to say...other than this book is great!,The other reviews here sum up this book nicely. It is very insightful and great to read. Highly recommended.
4,SONG TITLES LISTED HERE:,1. One Heroic Moment2. If Only3. Don't You Think I Count ?4. You Don't Know The Half Of It5. Here I Am6. Thy Will Be Done7. What Difference Does It Make8. What I Wanted To Say9. Your Own Little World10. Without You I Can Do Nothing11. Will You Too Go Away
5,This is a cool book!,"Libby on Wednesday is a really cool book. The characters are really cool and interesting. The plot is interesting, and a big scene at the end makes this book totally exciting. This is a really great book!"
4,LOW is very pulls-u-into-it-til-u-cant-stop-reading-it-ish,"this book really 's got a lot going for it, and is good for kids ages 8-about 11 or 12. it has examples of a good family life and good friends, as well as a wholesome, if somewhat odd, girl. I would read it if I were you."
1,Kitty Herbs,"I,ve been growing these for my cat for 6 years.The last two batches were expired.Bear in mind,I never knew they had an exp. date.Look at the back of the pkg.If the test date is 6 mos.or over,they probably will not grow properly.Mine were coming out moldy,brown and very sperse.I called Cosmic directly to resolve the issue."
2,Craptacular,"Unless you use this book straight away after taking an intensive Calculus II course, you're going to have absolutely no clue how they are doing any of the problems. They leave the ""explanations"" at an unacceptably high-level abstraction so that only those very freshly well-versed in Calculus can venture an understanding. Also contains no refreshers, not even a simple list of common integrals or integration formulas from Calculus. Just a crappy book, in my opinion."
1,I'm certainly glad I'll never have to take another calc class after dealing with this crap,"This is by far the absolute worst math book I have ever had the misfortune of using. The discussions teach everything using either completely abstract formulae or by using the absolute easiest example of that problem type. Then you get to the questions, which expect you to have mastered the concept of the preceding 10 pgs or so and be able to extrapolate these concepts to other topics (which the book offers no explanation of how to do). Overall, I would say you're better off learning this material from your cat's litter box, as it will probably make more sense. Also, i'm sure your cat put more effort into its litter box than the author's of this text put into writing this text."
2,Not compatible with Vista,"Here is Kingston technical support on the issue:Hello,This drive is not compatible with Vista and there is no update to make it work in this OS.Regards,Glenn NeumeisterKingston TechnologyTechnical SupportMonday - Friday 8am to 5pm PacificSo, think twice if you're planning to access this drive on a Vista computer at home, or anywhere else for that matter.."
2,Disappointing Flat Top Hat! Good for Halloween Costume Only,Order this hat if you're looking for something to top off your Halloween outfit only. It will arrive flat in a box and you will have to shape it yourself.For the price I thought it would be of better quality. I would expect to pay half what I paid in a Halloween shop.Quite disappointing!
1,Run for your life!,"The Gay bed and breakfast of Horror is the worst film ever! Attack of the killer tomatoes which has been voted the world worst movie is an A grade blockbuster compared to this film. Think of the worst film you have ever seen then multiply how bad it is by 100 and you might get close to how bad this film is. The plot of this film was weak and the acting even weaker. The script of this film should have been used to beat the writer about the head and shoulders as a fitting punishment for what he has inflicted on the world. Apart from a few of the characters looking good semi naked this film offers nothing to anyone who loves not just a good horror film but any film, ever! I'm sorry to those who are trying to sell this DVD but, I can highly recommend that you DON'T waist you money on the film as you will be disappointed."
2,Not even a good romance novel,"I am not a romance reader, but I have read a few good romance novels over the years. Some of them were even half way decent techno-novels. Ms. Saintcrow is telling us she is a paranormal romance writer, but she falls short in both categories. There are too many short cuts, glossing over high action details, long time gaps where the reader is expected to fill in the details. For the romance side, I thought I was reading a story of two angst filled teenagers. The character of Delgado was completely non-believable. He is supposed to be this ultra tough operative, but only swoons at Price's presence. I guess he is the perfect man, super bad boy, but like totally in touch with his feelings. She comes up with some good plot starts and themes, but never follows through, that silly angst thing keeps getting in the way.Sorry, but two stars is the best I can give this story."
3,Super Reader,"A young woman is more than a bit different. In fact, she has psionic abilities. This makes her of interest to two groups, the government Sigma agency, and a group of underground psionicists called The Society, that want to prevent such people being used as government tools for spook operations, etc.Of course, the society is set up like a covert agency themselves, out of necessity.The young woman is powerful, hence all the interest. Throw in the usual bloke that helps her out she will like, and a not too bad leave you wanting to find out what is going on ending and this book is ok."
3,Paranormal,I like Lilith Saintcrows writing style and her books have plenty ofaction. Sometimes the quilt trip of the two main characters got irritatingbut overall it was a good book.
2,"OMG, I am falling for her ... I must not ... OMG, OMG, OMG","Yet another icy, dangerous, flat-eyed hero who falls for a moping heroine.And every other page(!) we are treated to Delgado's innermost thoughts: OMG, I am falling for her. OMG, I must not fall for her. OMG, OMG, OMG. Not so heroic and really 2-dimensional. Thankfully, the heroine Rowan, whilst guilt-ridden and a little mopey, is not so downright silly.Having said that, the story idea is good and overall the book is better than just sufferable. I'll just ignore the torn and ultimately whiny hero. ;)"
5,Perhaps the best TV movie I ever saw,"This movie tells the true story of an African-American teacher who opted out of the public school system and succeeded with kids who everyone said could never succeed. An inspiring modern day ""Horatio Alger"" story of achievement and the overcoming of obstacles. What happens when failure is not an option."
4,Great movie lacked one issue,"Yes, the movie was very good. I am a follower of Marva Collins, who I consider the greatest teacher of our time. I only wish the DVD came with an interview of the real Marva Collins, or at the least, a copy of the TV 60 Minutes story which is only 15 minutes long.Also, if the DVD came had a Spanish option, it would reach a lot more who need to hear her message.I also highly recommend her book where she and a co-author tell it like it is.She is as great as Martin Luther King Jr. Both state that skin is not the issue, but the content of one's character which Marva Collins pinpoints with success.God bless them both."
2,Crap Dimension,"Some good action early on. The story really begins to drag... I found myself asking ""Is it over yet?"". Very odd sex scene as well. The ending leaves many loose ends. Not worth the space on my DVD shelf."
2,charlie's angels in japanese animation style,"if you want to see some japanese anime to be transformed into real-person movie, then this cheesy movie is definitely for you. leave your logic, reasoning, sanity and whatever you usually thought normally human out of the door, enter into this new generation of crazy japanese movies heavily affected by their animation comic books. there're so many movie like this being made and produced not just in japan now, it's like plague, even the third world movie industries are making them now. watch it like watching cartoon movies, then you'd be fine."
5,Bermans brilliant playing,This is a CD that I would recommend to anyone.The playing is is of a superb standard. I have never heard a better version of the Funerailles or the Erlkonig.The Scriabin is new to me and I was greatly impressed. The recording is good and the disc is an incredible bargain at the price.
3,Being a Buddhist monk.......,"I have no money, and live in Tibet. Through some karmic mechanism, I received one of these jackets in the post. There is a note, indicating that it was bought by a Rabbi in Brooklyn, and sent to an evangelical Christian, who returned it to Amazon. A shipping clerk in Idaho then sent it to the Mormon Church, and it was carried by a young man on a bicycle for 4 days prior to being shipped to me. My observation is that, while all is suffering, there is always joy. Thank you for sending me this jacket, which required the killing of no animals. Namaste."
3,ok,"is ok, got it at a great price. doesn't keep you very warm, but that's not so much of a problem for me; live in the city. not very stylish."
5,a Saint for every day,"I am an avid reader and faithful Christian.....this book gives me inspiration, very truthful and to the point....I realize that even a saint has faults...."
3,Mixed bag,"The author gives interesting details about many of the lives, but too many are covered as merely legendary. What are the the legends? As long as a day is reserved, the story could be interesting!"
2,religious,I purchased this single book hopeing it had mor indepth information on the lives of various Saints. It is good to a point if you are interested in the saint who's feast we're celebrating that particular day. It is a good book but if i had the money i would have purchased the full set of Butler's Lives of the Saints.
3,Butler's Lives of the Saints,"I say it's OK because I was looking for something with the details of the miracles the saints are connected to in order to qualify to be canonized a ""Saint"". In all fairness, the cover does say it is ""Concise"". I was hoping for something with much more detail."
3,Good general-purpose cheese knife,"Contrary to the - unfortunately very silly - previous review on this item (the one that complained it was too sharp) this is a nice, general purpose, all-around cheese knife. Admittedly, its a jack of all trades though master of none, but I wouldn't be without it. Its useful for things from soft moist cheese (the flat, solid blade is convenient for spreading) through semi-soft cheese. Too firm, and the blade isn't an ideal shape to bring weight down through the cheese. Not the first knife I'd get, or even the second - get Swissmar's planer and a knife from HenckelsJ.A. Henckels Twin Collection Cheese Knife- but I've found it useful as a small, handy knife."
1,be careful,Wanted a simple cheese knife for my husband and upon inspection my son cut his finger on it. Way too sharp for anything. I feel it is not necessary for a cheese knife to be this sharp!
1,Unreliable,"I'm on my third book and I haven't own it more than 6 months. The first one died after I unplugged it to move it to another location. It lit up but there was nobody home. Lost all my data. Second one just died the light just blinked on and off. Lost all my data again. Third drive, not taking any chances this time. I'm going sell it on ebay and cut my losses."
3,Mixed review,"Had the 160 Gb drive for over a month now, got it on special for about $90. Reformatted it into NTFS upon receipt and started backing up files from two old computers.The GOOD: it seems to be working fine, just plug-and-play, Windows XP does the rest.The BAD: (1) the drive does make some noise at times, not really expected from WD stuff (have had other of their products in the past, no complaints), (2) you cannot 'disconnect' the drive from XP at least 9 out of 10 times, as the drive still runs even though you're long done accessing it. I've tried to let it run to see if it would stop by itself and 30 mins. later, had to boot off my laptop before unplugging this thing... Cannot take any chance erasing the date inside, although they say it's safe..I might switch to another product soon if I cannot get any patches for the latter problem."
4,Classy looking drive with excellent performance,This is definitely the classiest looking external drive out there. It is super fast and worked great out of the box with my MacBook Pro and PC. I would be lost without it.
5,"best value, sturdy and reliable, looks great on your desk","my WD My book has been so reliable, holds a ton of memory, is the best external HD you can get at this price, and looks sleek."
5,Very Pleased,I have found the my book essential edition is easy to use for backup and retrieving files. It is quiet and has filled my need for more space.
3,Not as good as expected,"From the description and all the reviews, I was expecting more of an every day conversation, and was disappointed. This is the intermediate/advanced version. I am an intermediate french speaker and wanted to spend more time listening to real french conversations. This was more of a presentation given by one person, not a dialogue of everyday conversations that I could practically apply to daily living. The level of french was OK but simply boring and tedious to listen to. It looks like the beginning version was more of a true conversation so I'm thinking that is more practical for most people. Unfortunately, I decided to return it."
5,WOW!,"This is an amazing book of short stories. They will make you think make you laugh at times and may even change you. All the characters are women but don't be fooled. The stories have a great deal to say to MEN too. The writing is very concentrated like a cup of strong espresso. I read a lot of nonfiction such as psychology, philosophy and spirituality. This book of stories is as thought provoking as anything I have read. Moreso because you enter worlds that are stripped down to basic emotions and ideas. I have read it twice so far. I plan to read it again and then go looking for another book by this author."
3,Good But Incomplete,"The Stranglers were a great band and this collection has a lot of great songs, but it is inexcusably missing their two best---""Hanging Around"" and ""Get A Grip On Yourself""."
2,Ripped off!,"The ad on Amazon stated this was the 2008 release of this cd. However, the catalog # on the spine itself is for the 1991 pressing. Not impressed. Beware!"
2,Disappointing,"I will keep this slicer and use it; however I was disappointed in the cost VS quality of this item.It works well enough for occasional use, I am hoping the blades do not rust or corrode."
1,NOT HAPPY,"Being from New Orleans I was really excited to see this CD on Amazon.Bought a copy for my sister and one for myself and when it arrived NO WHERE on the CD doesit give the Artist who is singing the song. They have the song titles on the outsideas well as the inside of the cover but not who is singing the song.So if someone ask who is singing that song. I guess I will have to say, hold onand let me look it up on the internet!!!What a dissapointing and absolutely stupid oversite on the makers of this CD.Do not recommend for this reason."
3,Beautiful illustrations but a celebration without fireworks,"I really looked forward to seeing this book. The subject matter is dear to my heart and a quick glance through the illustrations promised a great deal. But, despite some interesting interviews with ex-employees and some great Roy Cross artwork, much of the dialog is rather bland and insipid and it actually became a bit of a chore trying to get to the end of the book. Part of the problem is that there are some bits of Airfix history which really aren't worth celebrating but which the author has presumably felt duty bound to include to the detriment of the overall package and it's also very frustrating to find references in the text to kits which aren't illustrated in the book. A few more reference photos would have been nice but please, why the grubby looking cover?"
1,Looks great if only using once!,"I purchases one of these fountains for a party I was having. It was a huge hit. Though later when I brought it to a scout function (where I was in charge of coordinating the food and drinks), it didn't have enough force to pump the punch all the way to the top of the fountain. Without the trays on it, boys thought that it looked like a red bubbling volcano. Not quite the elegant look I was going for."
1,One Time Use Only,"Out of the box, everything went great as expected. One year later, I used water to test the fountain...no dice. It appears the pump is shot or is not providing enough power. The warranty is already expired. I opened up the unit to take a closer look at the pump and it says, ""water only."" How about juice, soda, etc? Next time, we'll find a fountain with a two year warranty. We wont buy this brand again."
5,AWESOME INFORMATIONAL CD...,I think this CD is great...It has some really good info on different animals. I use it to homeschool my son whose in 3rd grade.
4,Colorful broad look at Nature's variety with easy navigation,"Easy to install CD-ROM with sophisticated detailed graphics, linked throughout, good sounds, videos, back ground music. Informative with pocket book for the mouse impaired or coffee top. Kids 6 and up."
1,This is RUBBISH,"Having known Donna since teaching her children in preschool through high school age, I am appalled at what is written here. IF you are interested in Donna's life then read Ordinary Life and leave it at that. Donna truly is one of the sweetest people in ""celebrity life"" that I have encountered. And its really upsets me when these kinds of books are written as a informational book. SAVE your money!!"
5,Donna Summer:Her Life and Music by Josiah Howard,"i thought the book was very well researched,i was impressed by the early rock n roll band stuff i didnt know Donna did(and im a big fan since the beginning!)i was completely SATISFIED by the uncovering of the ""gay scandal"" stuff...all in all i COULDNT put this book down!it left me wanting to know MORE, MORE, MORE about Donna the woman, mother, and wife...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
1,fairly weak,considering the Subject matter i expected more details than some things that were long ago known.this Book feels more like a copy&Paste.Donna Summer is a Foxy lady&Has Made some Very Important Music&this Book doesn't capture that at all for me.looking for Her Book later this year.
3,okay book,"This book is the best one on physical exam that I've found, but is not great by any means. It's very boring to read. Unfortunately, physical exam is something you have to practice, and reading a book won't help much. You have to SEE someone with experience perform an exam for it to really sink in.I think it's way too expensive."
1,"Errors in book, lacking correct information","I would not recommend this book. On techniques of examination of the Nose and Sinuses this book shows and tells you to use an otoscope with an ear speculum to examine the nose. This is wrong. The correct way to examine the nose is with a bivalve nasal speculum and a penlight or a headlight. Also an ear speculum should only be used to examine the external auditory canal of the ear. When Dr. Barbara Bates was the author of this book this correct information on the nasal examination was in the book. Dr. Bickley should not have taken correct information out of this book and inserted wrong information. Also this book does not have posterior rhinoscopy(examination of the nasopharynx with a nasopharyngeal mirror), indirect laryngoscopy with a laryngeal mirror, anoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy. I recommend Textbook of Physical Diagnosis 4th ed. by Mark Swartz, M.D. for Physical Diagnosis courses not Bickley's book."
5,Very good resource,I purchased this book for a course I was taking to supplement the lecture. The book is very detailed and will remain on my shelves as a reference for years to come.
1,Disappointed in documentary,"I was expecting more then this documentary delivered. After viewing the documentary I was not persuaded by it. While the current rating board is not perfect, it is still a guide. In every situation in life we can always find examples that may show an inconstant behavior in judgment. We can use the Baseball Hall Of Fame as an example. One player may gain entrance while another, with similar life time stats does not. So I am not surprised we find the same situation in movie ratings. Ratings are important and I am sure that rating a film is not always easy. Those that want a more friendly movie knows what they have to do, yet we find them complaining in this, so called, documentary. They would rather change the system then change their movie. While some may have valid complaints displayed in this movie, the system as a whole, does do an effective and difficult job. Any system replacing it would also receive criticism."
4,Interesting......,Very interesting documentary about how corrupt the ratings bureau is. Too bad they don't do a documentary about how they can change the way the Papparazi are allowed to operate as insurgents and terrorists to the hollywood stars. That is more disturbing than the ratings system.
4,A Crippling blow to the MPAA,"I despise the MPAA. Ever since I was a 12-year-old kid sneaking into R-rated films I was more than mature enough to watch, I have been amazed at the arbitrariness of it all. It's a voluntary ratings system that really isn't voluntary. Standards are unclear and contradictory. Its raters are secret (until now) and appeals rarely happen.There is something terribly unjust about a small cadre of white, conservative, upper-middle class Californians deciding for the whole country what is and is not appropriate. These are not average parents, nor are they representative of a divere nation.As for the film itself, it shows graphic material that didn't get an R-rating. Some of it is stupid, such as Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Orgazmo. Others, like key scenes in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" are truly awful calls by the MPAA. At the end of the film all the raters are revealed and some will come out thinking the MPAA ratings system should be at the least reformed, if not abolished out right."
4,Hypocrisy unmasked,"This documentary is at its acidic best in pointing out the hypocrisy of the MPAA in its relative treatment of sex vs. violence (hatchets in heads and bodies dismembered by chainsaws are ok, female pubic hair is a definite no-no), male vs. female sexuality, and straight vs. gay encounters. Unfortunately, the film meanders into sidelines such as video piracy and McCarthyism without ever suitably tying them to the central theme, and too much time is spent with the rather boring private investigator trying to identify the anonymous members of the MPAA's secret cabal. Overall, however, a strong indictment of the MPAA and, on a broader level, of those who would limit all society's access to artistic expression to what fits within their own personal moral views."
4,awesome doc,"Awesome documentary. Very informative. Although, I sense some cool details were edited for the same reason other indie movies are rated NC 17. Its still a great documentary. Goes hand in hand with this other doc; indie sex."
4,A steping stone for better communication,"This book had some great points to it. It basically goes through about eight chapters discussing an easy way to communicate. I had the pleasure of reading the book and take a class with the author which very delightfull. Some of the down fall to the book, Some of the examples are out dated. I do suggest this book for anyone intersted in learning a better way of communicating."
2,"Theoretical,takes work to translate it into something useful",One can tell that this work stems from the research of the author but he fails to translate it into something useful. It took a lot of effort to translate the concepts into something that my students would use in the database real world. I got sick of the little sidebars that had interesting but useless tidbits concerning notions of time. This is not for the developer but it might be useful for someone that is SQL knowledgeable that wants to check out some variations on time and temporal specifications.
1,Not a case of 6 kits,"This ad is misleading. This is a single starter kit with the wand and 6 disposable heads. It normally sells for around $10 in our local stores. (Not a $70 value as ad states). The product is very good. I have purchased it locally quite a few times and use it both at home and at my business. It is so convenient and cleans very well. But I was expecting to receive a total of 36 disposable heads and 6 wands, not one kit with 6 heads in it."
1,"Misleading title, not a case of 6 kits!!!!","This is NOT a case of six kits as the item description indicates, it is a single box with six brush heads. Customer service was friendly and provided me with an RMA, but buyer beware on this specific item, it is NOT a case of 6 units, it is a single unit."
1,Misleading,"As other reviewers have stated, the title for this product is very misleading, the product itself is excellent, the issue in play is the expected quantity. I expected 6 kits, 6 handles + 6 cleaning pads in each kit or 36 pads. What I got was two handles and 6 pads...a far cry from the $70+ value implied in the write up.Furthermore, I could never get any response from the company regarding additional pads, or return information. Overall a very poor transaction."
4,Under The Radar,"I recently had a conversation with my my brother in law, a brilliant guy, who worked in the music industry, and we both arrived at the conclusion that the best music is the stuff that flies ""under the radar"". YOU have to seek it out. Also, like a good book will lead you to other good books, a great musician will usually lead you to other great musicians. I heard of Nguyen Le through the work of the otherworldly double bassist Renaud Garcia-Fons. ""Bakida"" is an excellent album that rewards the musical seeker. It is difficult to describe as Le has successfully absorbed elements of rock, jazz,and ""world music"" especially from his Vietnamese heritage. He passes it along to us in a sound that is improvisational in nature, familiar to Westerners, yet exotic and adventurous.I would also recommend ""Fragile Beauty"" by Le and Huong Thanh. I recently gave it to a dear Vietnamese friend who said the songs made her homesick (not my intent!)"
4,"A recovered classic, but....","I've been a devoted Eric Andersen fan since about 1969. I knew about the missing tapes for decades, and was really excited to learn they'd turned up. That said, ""Stages"" is really good, but as a follow-up to ""Blue River"" it's a bit of a let-down. Some of the songs were done better on ""Be True to You"" (though it's great to have ""Time Run Like A Freight Train"" without tympani, and ""Can't Get You Out of My Life"" as a country song instead of an imitation of ""Court & Spark""). I like it a lot, but it doesn't rank with ""Blue River,"" ""Ghosts Upon the Road,"" or ""More Hits From Tin Can Alley."""
4,So glad they found it in the vaults!,"I believe it is also worth noting that the last four tracks on the disc were recorded in 1990 with help from Rick Danko and Shawn Colvin, and are among the standout tracks on the album!"
1,Dissatisfied customer,"I have had trouble with this software to translate English to Spanish. It seems to lock up on the computer, and no instruction came with the software."
1,This pool is useless,"We bought this pool, brought it home and set it up. The included literature describes the ""new and improved"" valve- I don't know what it was like before they improved it, but this valve is terrible. I inflated it- there's no one-way flap on it, so as soon as you try to plug it up much of the air escapes- and inserted the plug on the valve. Ten seconds later the plug popped out and the ring deflated. I repeatedly tried to inflate it, but each time the plug would pop out. It's going back to the store this afternoon."
2,Great pool; bad valve,"My son received this pool as a birthday present. We loved how quick it was to set up and easy to store. After a few uses, the air valve came completely out of the socket, so it will not hold air, making it useless. It is a great idea and so easily stored. I hope they will improve the air portion of the pool, or eliminate the need for the air pocket all together."
1,SEE A LAWSUIT HAPPENING!,Children could get stuck and drown between the spring base and air filled top if not filled to the very top!
2,not as expected,"i ordered this product with the thinking it was tobe like shown yet was not and displeased witht he purchase yet will not send back as cost just as much to send back as i purchased it for so will find someone who can have use for it,,,the return policy at amazon is not good if you purchase something you should be entitiled to free shipping in return like other places and sites on here so i dont think i will be purchasing from amazon any longer."
2,i don't recommend this one!,"my children were so excited about getting this. within five minutes most of the accessories had ripped or were broken. the little plastic/rubber strips for the tank and the vest broke almost immediately. maybe this would be fun for an older child. ????? it doesn't really do anything and after all of the accessories broke, my kids ignored the doll, didn't want to even play with it and i finally tossed it. sorry. it is a cute doll and the shipping was great, it arrived quickly, etc, it just didn't hold up in our house."
4,Cute and comfortable,These are one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've worn in a while. Never had to break them in. Were comfortable from day one. They were also true to size for me. I normally wear a size 8.5M and they fit perfectly. A size 9 would have been too big. Got the blue and wish it were a bit darker but hey the color was described as blue and not navy. Still looks great!
3,Great but not perfect,"I love the styling of these measuring cups, but the handle bent when I was measuring brown sugar. I just scooped it out of the canister like I normally do - and it was nice and soft. I wish the handles were stronger."
5,The Best on the market for the begining HTML user!,"I have read at least 10 books on HTML and this is far and away the best!!!! With an excellent lay out and format, Lee Anne Phillips starts at square one and progresses to more advanced topics. You will not get bored or lost with this book. Co-Author Bill vernon's support and interest is the best seen to date! If you want a homepage, buy this book!!"
2,Terrible as an HTML companion book,"Although this book covers pretty much all the elements of HTML, I discovered a significant number of incomplete syntax specifications. I was especially disappointed in its coverage of forms. The chapter just breezed through all the different types of form elements and didn't explain how data from these elements are handled when submitting a form. Because of the inadequacy of this book, I often find myself having to surf on the Net to find answers to my HTML questions."
5,Outstanding Reference Guide,"QUE's ""Unsing HTML 4"" was and continues to be a great reference quide. It also has easy indexing for new HTML authors. This book is definitely the best choice for either experienced authors or beginners."
4,A Good Tutorial if You Have Some Previous Web Knowledge,"Using HTML 4 Spec. Edition is an excellent tutorial and reference for the consumer who wishes to learn HTML. The only downside to this book is that you must know a good deal about web design already, not neccisarily HTML, but the overall idea of web design and publishing. I would recommend this book to most people who are interested in learning HTML."
2,"Comprehensive, but often overly chatty","You can read a book like this in two different ways: 1) as a reference 2) reading straight through.I found the style of the writing to be too casual to comfortably use as a reference. After awhile, I got annoyed by the author's overly-conversational tone when describing how things work (e.g. interjections of ""Cool."")Reading straight through I found the examples too repetive. For instance: a 10 line excerpt is repeated twice within a paragraph, where only the first line differs. This happens again and again. In longer examples the waste of space gets much worse.I think the text and examples would be both easier to follow and more compact had there been more thoughful use of font and color.On the good side, the text does a good job of warning where incompatibilities exist between browsers. It also puts quite a bit of effort into giving the reader starting points for accessing additional resources."
5,I love this CD,"I love this CD. I was in search of the single ""Dancing in my Sleep"" by Joi Caldwell and found ii on this cd. I enjoy listening to all the tracks which take me back to the old school club days !!"
3,Best of British,"I will give Black Belt Books an A++ for fast delivery, but the actual CD gets about a C+. I had hoped for more old school Lovers Rock because of the look of the cover, but alas it's mostly newer stuff. With 17 songs on the disc, I would say maybe 8 fit my listening taste so it was worth the money...but if you really want some old school Lover's Rock, go for the Vol.1 - Best of British Lover's Rock with the back of the topless lady on the cover."
4,Peter Cushing IS Sherlock Holmes,"This is the closest you'll ever get to see the late Peter Cushing in a ""stage play."" Watching him portray Sherlock Holmes is watching him become the character. No matter how many of his movies you have seen (and I've seen many, many of them), you must see him in these Sherlock Holmes stories."
4,"Elementary my Dear Reader, Elementary","My love for Sherlock Holmes is not easily described in a Review, so I'll simply say, (if) you're of the PBS persuasion-this Sherlock Holmes is for you. This Sherlock Holmes is a live Version, if you will. At times you will see Scenes of transition or flashback to a retelling of the Crime, overall you're getting an Onstage Version of Sherlock Holmes. <...> For those looking for a ""Movie"" you'll be disappointed. For the PBS viewer, you'll be very pleased to see these again. This Sherlock Holmes features Peter Cushing, no stranger to the role of Holmes, and Nigel Stock as Dr. Watson and was put together in 1968, a coninutation of earlier ""Holmes"" that featured Douglas Wilmer. BBC-PBS viewers, this Holmes is for you."
3,Disappointed,The production quality is old TV grade and is a distraction from the storyline. I'm sure I loved these episodes when they were originally broadcast but they are hard to watch now. The reviews warning about this factor are on point.
1,The Sherlock Holmes Collection,I wasn't able to watch the disc as it is the worse transfer I have ever seen on a $20.00 DVD. Full of artifacting and block noise. A tenth generation VHS looks better then this awful release. It's to bad as I was really looking forward to seeing these episodes. I can record better DVDs than this crap and day of the week without any effort.
3,A tedious Holmes,"Although this series was created 50 years ago, I've grown up on Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Britt in the title role. So, for me, Peter Cushing just didn't seem right as Holmes and that made the episodes tedious for me to watch."
4,Sherlock Holms Collection,"The dvd collection is very nicely done.I would say to anyone looking to see vintage peter cushing in action, that this would be the collection for them."
4,"Great release, but incomplete","It's great to see this on American DVD (NTSC). I have the PAL set from BBC but it doesn't play well on my all-region player. This set is much better. It's too bad A&E didn't arrange to include the two earlier b/w shows from the BBC with Douglas Wilmer as Holmes: the 1964 pilot (The Speckled Band) and the first of the 1965 series of 12 episodes (The Illustrious Client), which appeared on PAL VHS from BBC in 1996."
5,Fast shipper,"Ordered this Item and got it really fast , had no problems and fit great too. I would reccomend them to anyone.."
1,Total Disappointment!,"What a fascinating story this would be if this video actually told it! Instead, what the viewer gets is about five minutes of video about a guy the Lord seems to be punishing by making him do the AT--oh, and with said guy reciting verse by painful verse the words to the Amazing Grace hymn. Nothing about planning, training, people he met along the way, adaptions for the hike, feelings, how he teamed with his dog, Orient. Not even insights into Bill Irwin's spiritual experience along the way. This is a corny and amateurish production. And at just a few minutes long--about like a long music video--it felt like a rip-off, too."
5,Jesus was a Capricorn,"I can remember watching my mom iron with the headphones on listening to this record (and singing at the top of her lungs&#65533;sorry mom! ) when I was just a child. I was checking this album out to purchase for her, and am sorry to say, she will have to buy her own! It made me cry, the songs are so wonderful. ""Why me Lord"" did not make any sense to me when I was a child. I thought it was a tragic song about someone who had bad things happening to him. This song (as well as most of the rest) make me feel so good, they give me such hope. As a child, I could not see why she thought he was so beautiful, well now as a woman I can see! Kris Kristopherson has a new generation of fans!"
2,Looking for Ed,"Ed Burns broke into the New York film world with a bang, but it seems he didn't have much to say after his first movie. Looking for Kitty might just be the weakest of his films. The male bonding is clichéd and a little unbelievable; goody-two-shoes Abe is never a compelling character, so you spend most of the movie not giving a damn whether he finds his wife - and understanding why she left him in the first place. Understated, yet powerful and moving, the end is the only thing that's of value in this movie."
1,Random Assemblage of Tracks,"The best part of the CD is the case--a metal, round CD case with a painting of Ella. Otherwise it is a random collection of cuts from Ella with no information on where the cuts were taken from. Although it is called ""Early Years"" the track with Louis Armstrong is clearly from the 1950s, not the early part of Ella's career. Sound quality is OK, not great. There are better collections of Ella out there."
1,Camp without talent,I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this ... I gave it to my own three evil sisters .. they seemed to enjoy it.This is s chick thing .. guys beware.
3,Well made but...,"This wallet arrived in good condition and is good quality. I bought it because my old wallet was finally breaking down after many years of use and I needed something to hold my many cards and a few pictures. I am disappointed to discover that it only holds about 1/3 of the items from my old wallet.Pros: Many different places to put things, including a zipping compartment. Well constructed.Cons: So many dividers that they take up the bulk of the wallet. Limited capacity.Overall, a good wallet for someone who does not have more than 5 cards of any kind, plus a couple pictures, plus cash."
4,Sassy Lady,Definitely an amusing gift for any Frida Kahlo lover. The doll is very cute and complete with a unibrow!
5,Great Writer,Reading is one of my favorite pastimes. Johanna Lindsey transports you to another place and time. Medieval Romances are my favorite thing! I will definitely be ordering more books.
3,Misunderstanding,That's what this book should have been called. Overall the book was okay certainly not the best I've read from Ms. Lindsey. Leonie at times was annoying and Rolfe was just slow at catching on to things. Not bad but not great.
5,Medieval Love Story,"After her mother dies, Leonie's grief stricken father turns to drink and sends Leonie away from him. She lives in exile,at Pershwick, a keep left to her by her mother. Alain her neighbor and childhood friend has had his property stolen by Rolfe, the black wolf, and must flee. Furious, Leonie curses him. Unbeknownst to her, her people begin to plague Rolfe. In order to maintain peace, Rolfe asks the king's permission to marry Leonie and gets it. Rolfe has no desire for a wife and allows her to stay at Pershwick while he lives with his mistress. But Rolfe keeps thinking of the single night he and his wife spent together and realizes that he wants her in his home. Can Rolfe and Leonie look past his mistress and her family to find happiness together?This is one of my favorite stories by Lindsey. Leonie is warm and giving, although rather prideful. Rolfe is dark, dangerous, and handsome. Together they sizzle. A delightful love story."
3,No Consistency,"The author wanted us to believe that the heroine was a strong character, but didn't back up her opinion with action. Leonie and Rolf spend passionate nights together where they treat each other as equels and Rolf supposedly loves her. Then comes daylight and he's back to treating her like someone of a much lower stature.Then he continues to keep around his ""former"" mistress and never tells Leonie why. He continues to act like the rake that he is and she TAKES IT!!Leonie and Rolfe do get together and it infuriates me to no end!!! Do you see my frustration!!!!"
4,I could not put it down!!!!,"This was an excellent book. I picked it up and did not put it down until it was finished!!! JL has been a long time favorite of mine and I love all of her books. I gave this book four stars because I thought that overall there were just so many petty misunderstandings, that they took away from the storyline a little. Other than that, I loooved Rolfe. What a great hero! He was a terribly honorable man and I love that in a hero! I liked Leonie too, except that she was the one who instigated most of the misunderstandings. In spite of that, this was a wonderful book and I truly enjoyed it from start to finish."
3,Pretty good...,"This wasn't Lindsey's best novel, and Leonie was kind of annoying, but it was still better than the average romance."
2,Not quite what I thought.,"Earrings are pretty, but look cheap and very flimsy. I know they are supposed to be delicate, but they are not what they appear to be from the picture."
5,The Philosophy of Funny,"This book is absolutly hilarious, and gives the reader a view of the world I'm sure few of us have even considered. The obvious has never been so funny and philosophy never so modernly witty.It's a fantastic work of mind-bending, ""laugh-out-loud"" wonder.Umberto Eco has created a philosophic masterpiece for the masses.A MUST READ!!!"
3,Would benefit from photos of the finished shirts not just line drawings.,Has good ideas but could benefit from photos of the finished shirts not just line drawings. Hard to imagine how some of the fabric will lay.
1,VERY CREATIVE IF YOU LIKE TRASHY,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't believe this book got any good reviews. I've owned it for quite sometime, as well as both Generation T books which i highly recommend. I surf the net for recon ideas all the time. I've shown this to my teen daughters and their friends, and the consensus is summed up in this actual quote from one of them: ""THIS BOOK IS SOOOOOO INAPPROPRIATE."" I suppose if you have a perfect body and are looking for new ways to expose it, you would love this book. For the rest of us, not so much.The authors are clearly creative, so it is not for a lack of talent. I just wish they'd use that talent to built UP a T-shirt rather than chop it to smithereens.Generation T: Beyond Fashion: 120 New Ways to Transform a T-shirtGeneration T: 108 Ways to Transform a T-Shirt"
1,Really bad,"I didn't expect much from this book, but it delivered even less. There are no photos -- just stylized line drawings. Every project has an uninformative name (like Mimi or whatever) so looking at the table of contents tells you nothing. Which projects are shirts? Skirts? Totes? You'll have to flip through the entire book to see. The project descriptions are insane. A ""professional"" cut-up t-shirt? Ha! The designs are by and large unattractive, the instructions are very terse, and information that I would consider ""getting started"" (like how to make a dart) is actually placed at the end of the book. Not very helpful for new sewers. Frankly, I don't think anyone would get anything out of this book. Check it out from the library if you must, but don't waste your money buying it."
2,Great in theory--not in practice.,"If you look at the pictures in this book, you'll see that they're completely enchanting. Unfortunately, however, they really don't work in practice. In order for the draping of most of these shirts to work, you need to be working with a very fine jersey, which most tee shirts are NOT made of (particularly cheap event tees, concert shirts, etc). It seems to me that the people who put together this book did not actually MAKE any of the shirts themselves, which is why there are no photographs and only these very enchanting drawings.Plus, the instructions are convoluted and glossed over--a lot of the patterns would benefit from eight- or ten-step instructions, while we are only ever given four or five. Overall, if you're looking for a book like this, I'd recommend the much more comprehensive and comprehensively-photographed Generation T by Megan Nicolay instead."
2,Lots of mid-drifts and backless,"This book wasn't quite what I expected it to be. There were a LOT of backless and mid-drift models. Which is great if you're thin and don't need to wear a bra, and not much else.I also found the instructions to be very sparse, depending on diagrams almost exclusively to indicate where to cut or sew without explaining anything. I wanted to know if cutting a tshirt like that would cause it to unravel and what the longevity of the new fashions would be but there was nothing there that really addressed that.It wasn't really what I was looking for but there were some pretty clever fashions there for someone young enough and skinny enough to really enjoy them."
4,Fantastic,"I just love this book, I have made 18 totally different style t's. Easy to follow instructions.The book rates the level of dificulty and approximate time it takes to complete the project. I love it!"
5,I learned so much!,i got this book for my girlfriend because she loves to be creative with her old shirts. She loved this book and she's making her own fashion statement at her college now. She keeps telling me how easy some of the techniques are and how unique it is.I highly recommend this book for anyone not wanting to throw away your old t-shirts.
4,Creative ideas for T's,The styles in this book are geared toward the teenage years. It made a great gift when put together with the the 4 bargain priced T-shirts I bought to go with it.
5,30 Minutes or less to creative wizardry!,"You won't believe what you can do with some old T-shirts, a little time, a few odds and ends and a sense of fun. Many of the designs are best for the slender young-adult because they do show some skin. However, part of the fun could be layering the revealing cutouts and strips over other fabrics, making them appropriate for every age.Team this book with 99 Ways To Cut, Sew and Deck Out Your Denim for a wardrobe that is totally one-of-a-kind."
2,Cut and wear,"Nicely illustrated, BUT you probably won't make many of these. They are primarily for long-waisted, very young, very thin women who are showing more skin than most women should. Love handles and over-hanging bellies, girls, are just so NOT sexy. Besides, is sexy all we have to say about why someone should give us a second look?"
2,Risque designs with little instruction,"Most of the t-shirt designs in this book are just plain bizarre... A lot of large holes cut out of the t-shirt or jagged edges cut through it. Not something I would ever, ever wear (ok, I would maybe wear three of the 99, honestly...). A previous reviewer had it right when she commented the designs are made for skinny women who like to show off. This targeted demographic isn't a problem, but this is definitely not a book for every woman, and (if I had children) I wouldn't give it to my daughters as inspiration for art projects.Also, there are zero actual pictures in the book and relatively little instruction. There is one color drawing of each design (so of course it looks great) and a cursory explanation of how it was created.I think this book might be more appropriate for someone who has some creative sewing juices but needs a little extra help thinking of unique designs to create and someone who is not afraid to show off."
3,"Lots of patterns, but....","This book really does have 99 patterns for t-shirt reconstruction. However, at least half were either too ridiculously revealing or too off the wall to wear in public-- and I am not the most conservative twenty something. My main problem with this book is that IT HAS NO PHOTOS-- you really can't get a great idea of how something will work out unless you see a photo. This has cute little penned drawings, which really dont tell me if this would work out, how it would hang, etc. Also, instructions are limited, mostly diagrams, and if you are not a visual learner, that might prove difficult. Also, a lot of the 99 are variations on the same theme. But, it could spark some creative ideas. Check this out at the library before purchasing--"
5,Norma by Bellini,"I heard this recording, again, on [...] a Seattle-based classical music radio station. They recommended this version and I think it is one of the best opera recordings I have in my collection.This recording with Maria Callas is outstanding, and thoroughly enjoyable."
3,Probably would last forever...,"These pads would likely last just about forever, however they don't have great initial bite and are pretty much equivalent to really worn pads for the actual brake power they deliver.They are however really consistent, relatively quiet (they tend to squeak if light pressure is applied at low speeds, e.g Stop and Go traffic when you just barely wanna creep forward) and don't seem to dust up too much but I've only had them on a couple of weeks.I'm returning them most of all because my wife needs sharper pads on her car and I don't want to go between the cars and feel a major difference; otherwise I'd deal.Application: 2007 G6 Base non-ABS."
3,A Fast Paced Learning Experience,"Though not the ideal bok for the novice horseplayer, this book give insight and information most people interested in the thoroughbred racing game have no idea exists. Written by a reporter, the prose is quick and is filled with quotations by trainers, owners, jockeys and track officials in a real time, fast-paced dialog that is powerful but sometimes difficult to keep up with.There is no glossary or index of terms and many of the terms used are over the heads of those just learning about horse racing. This book is focused toward a betting audience or readers who currently follow racing and want to learn the intricacies of this most captivating sport.Funny and hard hitting, this is good read and for the most part well done. Again, not for those just making a foray into this unseen world of lovely mounts and high stakes, but a good book to get acquainted with what happens before and after the starting gate opens."
1,Have it; Don't read it,"Many of the Annals books, including this one, of Ireland are essentially unreadable. The prose is so dry so as to dessicate the history it purports to record. They are bogged down (no Irish pun intended) in tribal minutiae so arcane and irrelevant that the books could almost be spoofs. Judging from its prevalence in these books, it must have been the style of that format at that time, but it is still deadly. Most buy these books because of a family affiliation. I am confident that the vast majority of these books end up on shelves unread past the fifth page. If you want to own this book so you can have a complete collection of annals from your part of Ireland do so, but don't even think about reading it."
1,Howdigeburned?,"I had watched the original and honestly found it a little too British - slow, not all that mysterious and hard to sympathize with the main character. But this version - awful, just awful. Cage's hysterical overacting and the just plain weirdness - the bear suit scene has to be seen to be believed - make it sort of tolerable, but only once you've completely given up on seeing a straight horror/mystery and just sit back and wonder what paranoid misogynistic thing will happen next. Taken with that attitude, you get a lot of ""huh - didn't expect *that*"", but that's hardly worth making a movie. The youtube highlights video shows you everything ""good"" about the film and is short and free."
1,It gets one star only because there is no option for zero stars,"Who ever heard of anything like this?A town in which the men are afraid of the women?People who actually live in reality and no one else knows that they are there? (As in, government officials.)A police officer disappears and no one notices? And this is after taking off of work and mixing police and personal business?I only spent about US$0.30 on this movie (CNY2) and I still sometimes want to slap myself for wasting even that much money. This movie went *straight* into the trash after I viewed it."
2,Not Very Good!,"We had seen the original Wicker Man so we knew what the storyline was about, however this version left so much to be desired. First, let me say, that I truly enjoy Nicolas Cage and think he is a wonderful actor, but he should have passed this movie up. He did the best job he could do with what he was given, but the movie...well! As you know he is searching for his ex-girlfriends daughter who turns out to be his own.Determined he insults everyone on this weird island and is totally clueless to what is about to happen to him. Which might I add waS totally gross. I was bored and I had some questions that I wanted him to find out the answers for....why did the men stay there (the few that they showed,) and why didn't they fight these woman? Did they for sure kill any male children born?? The answers to these questions would have made the movie at least a little bit more interesting. Anyway, I'll still enjoy Nicolas in other movies I'm sure, but this one needs to be put to sleep."
2,Just awful,"Gave it two stars because all of the cast actually did a good job. The costuming was fabulous. The sets and locations they used were terrific. But the changes made to the characters and the plot watch like the work of several different people who couldn't be made to agree. Beyond the details that were tweaked, as a thriller it doesn't work. The original cop never saw it coming."
1,IQ Lowered,"This movie was so absolutely terrible that my IQ lowered, and now am stuck with knowing I will never be able to get those two hours of my life back."
1,Please listen to me!,This was Horrible!!! Don't listen to anybody who says this was a good movie. Don't waste bandwidth by downloading via bit torrent.
2,Let's put Neil LaBute in a Wicker Man!,"Ok..so maybe that's a bit harsh, but this is truly shameful and sad. I will say that I much preferred Edward Woodwards deadpan serious performance over Cage's silly, obnoxious and way too familiar over-the-top portrayal of the lead. This ""remake "" is just too silly to be believed. It is sad that fine actors like Burstyn and and Sobieski wasted their time on this film. Cage can basically have at it with these kinds of unwatchable dreck because he is quite simply a bad actor. Those of you who have not seen the original 1972 classic...RENT IT! It is brilliant!"
3,"Not great, but not totally worthless","I must say right off the bat that I've not seen the original upon which this remake is based so I had the luxury of not comparing the two while watching the 2006 version of The Wicker Man.No, this is not a great movie, but on the other side of that, it's nowhere close to the worst that I've seen either. Cage chews the scenery so much that much of his performance is laughable, but at the same time I couldn't turn away. The movie kept me engaged and curious to see it though to the end. While I've not seen the original film, I am aware of the climax of that movie and was curious to see if the newer version would carry through.Go in with the purpose to be entertained and The Wicker Man will deliver; just don't dwell upon it too much after its over."
1,Garbage,"I saw this DVD on my suggested items list and I just had to warn people that its pure garbage.The only good part in the entire movie is when Nicholas Cage goes on a rampage, steals a black bear costume, and decks some crazy woman. Other than that it just drags and drags and makes you want to light yourself on fire."
1,Lucky to get 1 star,"This movie is a complete waste of your time. You could watch the first and last scene and save yourself a lot of time and frustration. In fact, here you go:Scene 1, Man wants to save girl.Scene 2, Man shows up at island to save girl. People surround man, hold him down, break his legs, hold a bag full of bees over his head, drag him to a gigantic man made of wood, pull him to the top of it, and light it on fire.The end.You could substitute the Cage character going to a baseball game for the middle of the movie and it would make about the same amount of sense."
3,WITH A FEW MINUSES -------,"I did like the settings and the colors - the acting was excellent - the plot confusing for a while -- in the end just plain gross.Poor, demented Edward -- why didn't he just shoot someone when he had the chance?maybe worth one watching but -------- not worth the aggrevation of finding the Wicker Man. Could had done without him.Will definitely not keep this one.See it if you must but be it on your head."
1,SPOILER ALERT,"Really it stretches the meaning of the word ""spoiler"" to say there's a plot spoiler following: but, with that said:PLOT SPOILER:Watch this movie if you want to see a man tortured and killed for being male. All through the movie it seems that the matriarchal islanders are evil and have the upper hand, and at the end you find -- surprise! -- they *are* evil and *do* have the upper hand.A snuff film.Possibly intended as a masturbatory aid for sufficiently self-loathing males.Conrad."
1,give this movie a negative star,"This movie is horrible. The dialouge is incoherent and the acting is the worst I have seen from any of these actors. Do your self a favor do not bother renting, buying or watching this movie."
3,The ending saved it.,"The wickerman will probably bore you throughout most of the film but the ending saved it a little. I won't say what happens but it made the film at least rentable. It is kind of mundane but you know that something crazy is gonna happen at the end, and it does. The movie never did tie up some of its loose ends. For instance the whole car getting hit but noone knows who's body it is. It was weird that the ""shocking"" alternate ending was just a little more graphic than the original and left another scene out. Some movie editors suck."
1,Bad,"I just saw this movie and it's one of the worst I have seen, it's a waste of money and effort from the studios and the ""movie stars"" that did it.It's dissapointing to see Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn in this disgraceful movie."
1,Don't waster your time,This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Nicolas Cage should be forced to return his Oscar. Thank God I saw this on an airplane.
1,Definitely in my top 5,"of the worst movies of all time> And I've watched ALOT of movies. This is MS3TK bad and I'm not sure they could even help it. I was actually seething with rage by the time it was over. Pure cinematic garbage. I would rather pick belly button lint from a 500lb man then ever watch this again. Yes, it's that bad...My suggestion, if you see one of these dvds> Destroy it, for all of humanity's sake...."
1,Obviously not the top of his class at the Police Academy,"Nicholas Cage plays a police officer who witnesses a disaster, and during his time of leave gets a letter from an old fiance who states her daughter is missing, some 8 or so years after they last spoke. So he decides to take it upon himself to investigate. Sounds interesting, but really really stupid. He must have been the last one in his class from the academy to figure out that A. It's his Kid B. He should just leave (swim boat, whatever the heck you can do, just leave) C. He's the Pawn in a game. The movie was predicatble, and a downright snorefest. Save the cash, save the time, pass this one by on the shelf."
1,"Ahh, my legs!","This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The story, acting, and script are horrible. Knowing this, it could be fun to watch. Your mouth will be open and you'll just look at your companions and none of you will say anything because you will know exactly what one another is thinking: Are they serious?"
1,Don't do it!,"I died a little on the inside watching this movie, it was that bad. Do yourself a favor and just hit yourself in the crotch with a hammer instead of watching."
1,Oh My Goodness What a Bad Movie,"I usually am a fan of Nicholas Cage movies, but this one is just plain awful. As others have said, very depressing and pointless. After watching it, I wished I had one of those memory eraser thingies you see in sci-fi movies. I sincerely don't ever even want to think about this movie again."
4,Good.,"I don't care what any of the other reviewers think This is a solid 3-4 star B movie. Granted it is Nicholas Cage who has a so so movie career. This is a high point for him as far as I am concerned. At least better than ""Bad Lieutenant"", a good movie. Certainly better than ""Ghostrider"", which is awful."
1,I had to give it one star because there's nothing lower,I wouldn't even take this if someone were giving it to me for free. Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy the Original starring Christopher Lee.
1,Avoid at all costs,Saw this in the theater. That's two hours and $17.00 I'll never get back. Avoid this movie and you'll thank me later.
1,Incredible,"No, it is not worth watching it. It is really a waste of time. One could have been doing something else, i.e., playing golf (movie is more boring). I wonder what the director was ""thinking."" Everything in this movie is bad. Photography is a perpetual state of fogginess, so is the acting, the plot, etc.The are so many holes in the plot that it feels like playing hopscotch without the numbers. Things appear an disappear without connections: accident, motivational tape, the death of the pilot, Leelee jumping Cage, the burned doll, the bees attacking the ""drone"" alomost killing Cage before the ending...The list is unending.I wouldn't describe this as a film, but as hodgepodge of meaningless ""ideas."""
1,Utterly Appalling,"This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. It is an insult to the original movie, but even were it to stand alone it could only be described as meandering, trite and totally incredible. What on earth were the directors and producers thinking of?The movie flits between stealing sequences and lines verbatim from the original and introducing utterly pointless, meaningless sequences that have nothing to do with the original story. The directing, acting and bizarre distortions of the storyline combine to turn every scene into a complete mess. Cage's acting is always crap, but William Shatner could have done a better job of this.Lazy, cheap and nasty. Watch the original classic British horror film - it's great, but don't waste your time or money on this truly awful drivel. Drying paint is more captivating."
1,wicker man is b wicker rated,"this movie stunk, the old one is stupid too. all horror movies are dumb, have no reason for existing. people who like to be scared have something really wrong with them. these people are seriously disturbed and need psychiatric help. anyone who likes horror movies i feel have emotional problems and mental health problems too. if not now they will later on in life. Wicker man is b wicker rated like all dumb stupid plot horror movies are. halloween is stupid and so is horror movies, hollywood needs to stop allowinig this crap in the theatres and stop producing filth that corrupts the morals of adults and teenagers."
5,What are all of you talking about?,"What is so wrong with this movie, it was so good, you are probably thinking i am a retard because ""I don't have good taste in movies"", personally i think the original one looks totally boring. i saw this movie snd thought i had great acting by nicolas cage, i had a creepy storyline, and it was very suspenseful. also the original one looks slow and drawn out rather than edge of your seat like this one is."
2,The Wicker Man Review,The Wicker Man was actually an interesting movie. It had a little bit of horror but also mystery and suspense! But it was very weird and twisted!! The village that he ends up in is ridiculous and i keeps you wondering. The people there are very secretive. Pretty good.....but........... the ending was THE most STUPIDEST ENDING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! it ended where they sacrificed him and then he burned in the fire and it ended right then!! it was ridiculous beyond belief!!!! that ruined most of the pretty good movie!!!!!!!
2,Pointless,"As enough people have pointed out already, this movie is painfully pointless. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot but I feel the end ruined the movie. The main character has visions and flash backs which, as far as most people will be concerned, are totally pointless. I would recommend renting this for the plot, but don't expect a spectacular finish.... Or a point to the movie...."
2,Horrible ending,"The movie kept you on the edge of your seat, no doubt about it. Maybe I should give it more than two stars, but the ending was horrible. This movie reminded me of the Tom Tryon book Harvest Home. Very well acted, I must say. Ellen Burstyn gave me the creeps. Nicholas Cage gave a flawless performance, as always. Don't know why he is never given more credit than he gets. He should have more than just one OSCAR win to his credit."
1,"Burn, Nicholas, Burn!","What is it with Nicholas Cage and fire lately? Between this and Ghost Rider, Nick up in smoke does seem a pretty fair metaphor for his career these days. It's hard to imagine what anyone was thinking as they put this together. It's beyond bad on so many different levels and never really tries to make much sense of anything. But Nick himself couldn't have been worse if he'd been filmed while reading the script for the first time. It's hard to imagine while watching this mess that these folks are professional actors, and pretty good ones, too, given half a chance. The only thing that would have made this hideously botched remake more bearable would have been to immolate the director in the final scene."
2,Unsettling and pointless,"I didn't know anything about this movie or that it originated as a novel, so this is soemone's take who is basing the review soley on this version.1 Build that gets old and slow at times2 plot holes and loose ends galore (ie; What was the deal with his visions??)3 this reminded me a lot of the Village which was a much better movie - better acting and more creepiness, too.4 Left me feeling unsettled due to the brutality near the end. If there was more history given, this might have added to the movie instead of just letting you wonder ""Why?""Two stars because I actually made it to the end - though I don't know that this is a good thing. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Horrible!!,"I have just recently seen this movie and I thought it was horrible! The actors were less than good at making me believe their roles, it did not catch my attention or give me the chills or scare me AT ALL, gives Horror a bad reputation, Nicolas Cage's worst role ever!! Good thing I did not go ahead and purchase this DVD. I recommend only renting this movie, if you are wanting to see for yourselves if you don't believe these reviews here."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!!",Anyone that gives this more than one star is either getting paid to do so or said person is just stupid. I received this from netflix and it is 100% the stupidest movie I've ever watched. There is a such thing as a good bad movie and this is not even remotely one. Right away when he gets to the stupid island you know he was intended to be there by the ramblings on of the bad actors. Cage is sacrificed at the end. He's the stupid wicker man! That's all you need to know. Do not waste your time on this idiotic film like I did. I wish I had the power to make all traces of this film disappear from the face of the earth. Worthless garbage!!!! I am now a dumber man for sitting through it.
1,The Wicker Man,I do not own the movie and will not own it. I saw the movie in the theater. Even though it is based on a true ritual it was still a very bizzare movie. If the reviews could give minus stars then I would give it a negative 1. I just don't think it is worth buying and definately was not worth seeing to begin with. I think Nicholas Cage could have made better time of doing another movie and not wasting his acting experience.
2,Another boring mystery movie..,"Let's not have anymore of this kind of so called mystery movies! Wicker Man will give you a very hard time trying to stay focused as hardly any exciting events take place. Could this movie by any chance secretly be another M. Night Shalyman movie? The way the story is being told reminded me of the Village, that other boring creepy story. Nicholas Cage stars once again as a police officer who needs to investigate the disappearance of a little girl and ends up in a place that is dominated by women. Without giving away the plot it is fair to inform you, that Cage boring performance is illustrating the lack of credibility of The Wicker Man.He looks just as if he already realizes, that this movie, will not interest anyone.(SARR)"
1,"Terrible, terrible movie","The HD DVD picture quality is decent enough, and that's the only positive thing I can say about this film. The dialogue is horrible. Nicolas Cage's performance is barely watchable. Kate Beahan's performance is one of the worst I've seen by any actress. The plot is predictable. This film is barely watchable."
1,Embarrassment,"Some of the worst screenplay and acting Cage has ever put forth. For the first twenty minutes he seemed to struggle portraying a bungling detective, then after noticing his bags were rifled through, he fails to check his weapon. This movie's plot was the weakest and it perverted the original author's intent. Character development seemed to be the only sturdy aspect of this film, but then it seemed like a bootleg copy of Studio Pro was used to fragment the scenes that otherwise would have given credence to the supporting actors roles. Too bad one star is the lowest rating you can give this film, because in my opinion Nicolas Cage should be forced to personally hand-deliver refunds."
2,"So bad, it was funny","We watched this because it was so badly reviewed. Anyone that wants a horrible nick cage movie, look no further."
1,the wicker mess,"If I found a dog turd in my yard and put it on a table,then sat and watched it for almost two hours,it would still be more enjoyable than watching this piece of garbage. I'll never get those two hours back."
1,Total Mess,"To be short and sweet...The Wicker Man with Nicholas Cage is an absolute mess. With terrible acting, embarassing makeup (see Ellen Burstyn's Braveheart tribute) and horrible script, this movie will go down in my history as one of the worst movies ever made!"
2,Another miss by Cage,"This movie is atrocious. I strongly recommend reading the book. Or even watching the original movie set in England. How the directors and producers could have interpretted the book this way, I have no idea."
1,Totally...,"WORST MOVIE, EVER!!! I felt like shooting myself for having watched this film. Seriously TERRIBLE."
1,Absolutely Abysmal Film,"If you want to see a decent version of this film, watch the original, which, though dated, has an ending that is truly chilling and horrifying. This version is absolutely abysmal."
1,The worst movie ever made,"I don't write many reviews, but this movie is so bad it deserves this many words about it... ""________________"". And I normally love Nicolas Cage movies. What a disappointment."
1,The Horror! The Horror!,"In cynical fashion, the major studios churn out needless remakes aimed at young moviegoers who lack imagination to track down the originals. The latest casualty is ""The Wicker Man"" - writer-director Neil LaBute's desecration of the 1973 British horror favorite. Like most contemporary remakes, it has been justly ignored. Hollywood's creative bankruptcy never ceases to astonish me."
1,WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!,"STUPID - EMBARRASSING - RIDICULOUS - LAUGHABLE AND FRUSTRATING. Just a few words to discribe this joke of a movie. Poor Mr. Cage! This is a career killer! At the end we both looked at each other with jaws agape and started laughing. ""you're kidding, right?"" STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS STINKING PILE OF POO!!!"
1,As if an idiot was asked to remake the original.,"It's that bad.I've always been enamored of the original version. Although it has flaws, it has always been among my favorite films.This version misses virtually every important point behind the original, and is nothing more than a sloppy, stupid, and ultimately incoherent mess.I really don't want to waste a single second more on this review. See the original. Please."
1,I want a refund!!!,"I was forced to see this after arriving at the theater and finding ""Snakes on a Plane"" had been unceremoniously cancelled. This is the worst movie I've seen in a looong time: stilted dialogue, lack of suspense and amateurish acting. Ive taken beginner's drama classes and my classmates were all much more authentic and engaging than these ""actors."" And Nicolas Cage's cheesy romance with the ditzy Willow ... Im still cringing.OH MY GOD IT WAS SOOO BAD. THE DIRECTOR OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR SPEWING OUT THIS OFFAL!!!"
2,I really don't know what I can say that hasn't been said already,"Sometimes I write long reviews and other times a short review works just as well. To compare this in any way to the classic movie of 1973 is an insult and to call this film a remake is an insult to all halfway decent remakes. This is the only movie Cage stars in that I have to go with the majority and say that he is not a good actor. Most of the time with Cage movies even if the story isn't very good he is at least passionate about the role.That just never arrives here. This doesn't even make it into the ""so bad its good"" category it is just bad."
1,As bad as a movie can get.,"This movie easily ranks on my top 10 list of bad movies. It's unwatchable. Everything about it is bad. The acting, cast, story, script, directing, and even the soundtrack are all horrible. This has to be Nicholas Cage's worst performance ever, and that's saying something. I always thought he was the most overrated actor in Hollywood. The story and script are so bad, that I could not finish it.I'll save you the horror of watching this trash by telling you what it's about. In a nutshell, Cage is lured/tricked to an island by a secret ""religous"" cult, of women, in order to sacrifice him via burning in the Wicker Man. They had a bad harvest of honey, so they felt a sacrifice was needed to improve next years harvest. I found out the ending through a coworker who obviously had a stronger stomach than I did. Even the thought of watching Nick Cage burn to death, is still not enough to get me to ever watch this piece of garbage again."
1,"Not the bees? Yeah, not this movie either!","The 2006 edition of THE WICKER MAN is, without a doubt in my mind, the very worst remake in cinematic history. It is also dangerously close to being one of the worst films ever made. I think that Robin Hardy, Ed Woodward, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland and all that were a part of the 1973 version (a great film everyone should see) should get a free kick to the nuts of ""George Lucas Look-alike Contest"" runner up Neil LaBute and Nicolas Cage. I couldn't believe how awful Cage was in this pile of llama dung! I wanted to turn the movie off so many times, but I was frozen in awe of how utterly atrocious it was. Watching this movie is almost self-mutilating. I know this is just another negative review, but I feel it is much more. I feel a need as a compassionate human being to steer as many people away from this movie as I can!"
2,Will Hollywood ever wise up,"From the movie,plot,location,music,and actors,this movie is toilet paper compaired to thr orginal,get the 1973 show,you will be glad you did,and let Hollywood,foul lang.and porn.are no replacement for well done."
1,MIND NUMBINGLY BORING,"HOW OR WHY NIC CAGE GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS CRAP, BEGS BELIEF, IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE MONEY.THE ORIGINAL WAS NEVER THAT GOOD, ALTHOUGH IT DOES MAINTAIN AN ADULT THEME THROUGHOUT, LOTS OF NUDITY ""ALWAYS A GOD THING""THIS REMAKE IS SLOW AND DIMWITTED, UNSUSPENSEFUL, AND ONE OF THE MOST BORING FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN.IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL, ITS WORTH CHECKING OUT TO MAKE COMPARISSONS, OTHER THAN THAT, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
1,why bother?,"this is by far the worst movie ever made with nic cage. mark my words you will be sorely disappointed. ranks right up there with ""the village"" by that m knight shamallayayallanannn guy. it sucks bad. dont want to ruin it for you but the best part was seeing nic burn alive for taking this role."
1,Doesn't hold a flame to the original,"Other than the titular character/thing, this movie bears no resemblance to the outstanding original. No paganism theme, no Christopher Lee, no Ingrid Pitt, no Britt Ekland serenade, and no sexual tension. All the things that made the original so great have been excised for the sake of commercialism (and to avoid offending religious people who can't bear to have their beliefs questioned).I won't say it's the worst movie of all time, or even the worst one I've seen this year, but I had to see how it compared to the original (not well). Maybe if they had called it something else, it would get more than one star from me.Just watch the original; nothing to see here."
1,Horrible ending,"I thought the movie had a great story line, and I loved the twist that it was all part of a greater plan, but you don't kill off the hero of the movie, especially not by his own daughter. I thought it was terrible!"
1,Reduced to a missing persons drama,"I saw this movie before I realized it was a remake. Yet, I still found the ending predictable. This is largely because (as I have now seen the previous version) the islanders are turned into a bunch of vicious maneating feminazis. The second mistake was the switch in setting from Britain to the U.S. You can't turn Pagans into Puritans. Yes, they made reference to Celtic ancestors, but they seemed much more as if they were from Salem. It is as if the original has been sanitized of its nudity and religion, and made into an empty shell of a movie."
3,Where are the Puritans when you need them?,"There's something fishy here. This movie so far has thirteen 5 star reviews and ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN 1 star reviews????? How is that possible?? I didn't think it was_that_bad. I thought it was tolerably suspenseful (where's the child?) and appropriately creepy (matriarchy- enough said), with a totally unsuspected ending (even though I hated it.) I thought it was a pretty good movie. I just think a lot of outraged Wiccans conspired to trash this movie on amazon because of its negative portrayal of their ""religion""."
1,THE worst movie I have EVER seen,"I've never been more sorry that I wasted my time watching such a pathetic movie in my life. It tastes of bad anti-pagan propaganda slop. It shows a clear hatred of women of all ages. The ending was depressing, stupid & anti-climatic."
1,As bad as it gets,"This has to be on the bottom 10 list of all time. I can't honestly say it's the single worst movie I've ever seen, but it's very close. Save your money and your time, don't buy this movie!"
3,"Short of the mark, but still decent.","This movie does miss the mark. Not only did they move the scenes to america, they changed the main evil characters sex and a few other liberties were taken.But the underlying plot is still a good one.Asked to investigate a missing child, a detective goes on his own to try and solve the case only to ultimately find out he is to become a human sacrifice.The problem with this movie is Nicholas Cage's acting is over the edge. There is a great gap in the other's acting and his. The sense of brooding and paranoia doesn't come through. And there's no growing feeling of doom either. It's as though the characters are just interpreting lines to their own liking instead of playing the movie out together... as a team.The Wicker Man is a wonderful mystery. However, I heartfully recommend the original way above this one. It plays on your fears, developes the senses of urgency, deadly secrets and dread."
1,Why...OH Why???,And I say it again. Why...Oh Why??? Was there any need at all to remake this? The obvious answer is NO there isn't!
3,Not as good as the original,"My oppinion: This new version of the Wicker man is horribale. they changed alot from the original story. most remaks stay true to the original but change a little but this one changed alot of it.About The Film: The wicker Man(2006) is a remak of The Wicker Man(1975) and the movie is about this california cop who witness a car accident and is on medication to help him, but when he gets a message from his ex-wife about a little girl Who is messing on an island he goes there and trys to help find the girl. can he find her lets hope.My Second Oppinion: This movie is really diffrent from the original. they changed practually the whole story. But cages performance and beging in the movie is the only reason for seeing it and in my personal oppinion buying it. watch the original and you'll understand how much they screwed up the story.If you liked this movie check out The wicker Man(1975) & The wicker Man original motion picture Soundtrack."
1,The worst blu-ray in my collection,"This is by far the worst movie in my blu-ray collection. The movie is just horrible. I bought it used off of E-bay, and the previous owner hated it so much, it appears to have been purposely scratched. I almost understand. That's not easy to do with blu-rays scratch-resistant coating, but there is a wavy scratch going all of the way around the disc (human-made, obviously). Despite this, the disc worked in my PS3.Avoid this movie."
2,The Village meets 8mm,"It seems Nicolas Cage is in a movie every other month nowadays, so they can't all be good. This movie falls squarely (and flatly) in the ""not good"" category. Having not seen the original, all I can say is that throughout this flick (it seemed much longer than it was), I had the underlying, horrific feeling that it was supposed to be deeper than it was - that it hasd some ""message"" that I was somehow missing. Now having read the reviews of this version and the original 70s version, I understand why this movie had the ending it had. But otherwise, the ending definitely leaves you with a ""what the hell was the point of all that?"" feeling; that is never a sign of a good movie. It fact, it is usually the sign of a bad one."
2,Worth a rental,"Let me start off by saying, I have not seen the orignal Wicker Man. This movie kept me guessing all the way through, which earns it one star. I couldn't tell if Willow was intentionally mysterious or a victim of bad acting. I did enjoy Ellen Burstyn's performance as the ""Queen Bee"" so to speak. So many unanswered questions or things that didn't add up stop this from being a 4 or 5 star movie. I am generally not a fan of neat, tidy, happy endings, so that wasn't a problem for me, but the numerous loose ends were. Worth a rental, but probably not worth purchasing."
1,"If I could give it a half a star, I would","This movie was a total waste of my money and time. DO NOT be pulled in by Nicolas Cage being in the movie!!! He is a great actor, but this was so beneathe him. He even had times when his acting was over the top. It was a disappointment, so don't buy it. If you are that curious, just rent it and waste your money that way."
2,cage acted bad in this film!,"i know this is a remake and i have only seen this one, but it really was really weird.. it kinda felt like watching the village mixed with the village of the damned.. just in that cult type way. i can not point out why i didnt like this all that much. the only reason it gets 2 stars is for some pop ups.. this was the hardest film to review cuz i cant point out why i didnt like it,, but i didnt"
2,Sharpened Only on One Side,"This knife does not work well for slicing cheese. It is sharpened only on one side, so there is a bevel to the blade that forces the knife into or out of the cheese you are slicing, biasing towards one direction. This makes it nearly impossible to get a uniform slice of cheese, and often I get only a few shreds while the knife fights against me. It is of high quality construction and is quite sturdy. It has little teeth on the blade that help it bite into the cheese, but will prevent later re-sharpening. Even after much practice I cannot get it to work to reliably slice uniform slices of cheese."
2,Get the Cutco cheese knife instead,Bought as a gift - because I love my Cutco cheese knife (Cutco #1764) but was too cheap to fork out the $50 as a present. Thought this one would be similar - but it wasn't. It's passable for a cheese knife - but the Cutco cheese knife is by far superior - I use it several times a week to slice thin even slices off Tillamook cheddar bricks and it works like a dream - perfect and easily sliced pieces every time - I've never had a cheese slicer or knife that was half as good and I've tried half a dozen or more.
5,It's a good knife,"It is sturdy, lightweight and balanced, the openings in the blade cut down on the ""drag"" when cutting soft cheese, and it goes into the dishwasher. That's all I wanted and I got it."
4,The Waltons - a great family show,"I love the Waltons & I've bought all the seasons. They had such great family values & I Think all the episodes are good. I missed not seeing Olivia, John Boy & grandma in these though, but otherwise, I enjoyed the 6th season."
5,Goodnight John-Boy...,Purchased all the DVDs in this series.. I you loved the show you'll love the DVDs.. Quality is good. Would purchase again..
5,"""Grandma Comes Home"" is remarkable episode","The final episode of Season 6 is unbelievably touching, as Ellen Corby returns to the show, still struggling severely from the effects of her stroke in November 1976. But her courage is remarkable and her acting ability, through her eyes and facial expressions, is still Emmy-worthy. Her scene with Michael Learned, trying to prepare the string beans, and then the final scene ever with Will Geer, who died unexpectedly two months after the filming of this episode, are unforgettable."
3,It's ok. but all good things do come to an end,"This is a great show in general. But as with all things, there is a time and a season... and this show is clearly nearing the end of its life. Without some of the original cast/characters, the show is just not the same."
4,Walton's DVD,"Who knew that Amazon.COM has all of the Walton's DVD's? I have found that out and my wife is very happy. This series is a wholesome, family TV show and she loves them! Thanks again Amazon for making my life easy."
5,"Great Season, Speedy Delivery","I ordered for two-day delivery and got it before estimated date. I had one problem with Disc 3 Side A where my DVD player wouldn't play it at all, but worked in my DVD recorder. I was afraid I would have to return it. I was happy I had no problems with duplicate episodes like others have reported.I wish they weren't on double-sided discs. They are prone to accidental fingerprints when handling. I plan to order the rest of the series because I've been a huge fan of The Waltons since it was on the network."
3,The whole Walton series 1 through 8,The Walton movies are all very good programs. The big problem is that on all of them there are missing programs that are supposed to be in the series. This is the second batch that I bought and the same shows are missing as in the first batch that I bought. Neither you nor Borders have a reliable source to supply you with a complete program series. This is very frustrating as I really wanted the whole set. I watch them every day now that they are no longer on the Hallmark TV station. Of coarse the ones that are missing are some of my favorites. Now what do I do?
1,An Old Favorite---Ruined,"A travesty that key sections of this movie were cut in the video release. I wanted desperately to replace my well-worn copy. Now will not even consider a purchase of this video. The events that were cut are artfully portrayed and so key to the character played by Bissett that her role may as well have been eliminated entirely. So...I wonder whether Ted Turner's company has had a go at editing the film ""Barbarella?"""
1,another disappointed viewer,"This film is very interesting, considering that the director's career began all the way back in the classic film era. I agree with the other customers-- the editing of this video is totally destructive. It has the same negative effect that colorization has on the great black and white films. The distributors obviously have no respect for filmmaking whatsoever. This purchase was a waste of money."
2,Dreary Sudser,"What a tedious exercise this flick is. The decades long friendship between a writer of highbrow elitist woman's fiction(Jacqueline Bisset) and one of lowbrow pop romances (Candice Bergen) is not only uninteresting it's unbelievable. Bisset makes her character palatable but the makers of this dreck villify Bergen's character making her an unbearably shrill shrew. A more accomplished actress could have engendered sympathy for their character but marginally talented actress like Bergen is not up to the task. ""Rich and Famous"" commits the cardinal sin of not being quite bad enough but only being mediocre."
5,Rich & Famous,A classic movie. The last movie that George Cukor directed. It's a movie movie with all the sentimentality and sex you would expect from a classic movie. A fine performance by Jacqueline Bisset but Candice Bergen steals the show. She is hilarious. I highly recommend this movie. For me it has become a perennial favorite because it has a Christmas and New Years scene.
1,Godawful,"Though released in 1981, this seems horribly dated today, with the male leads all but invisible and the storyline unsure whether to be a comedy or a drama. It's neither. It's just plain awful. The two women, Candace Bergen and Jacqueline Bisset have zero chemistry, so why they are lifelong friends is a mystery here. Mostly they scream at each other in supposed jealous rages over their careers and men. Made by a Hollywood dinosaur, George Cukor, this one is of use only as a curiosity piece. I found it agonizing."
3,"DVD gets a ""D""","In answer to recent and future reviewers: the new DVD version of ""Rich & Famous"" is NOT complete and uncut. Yes, the famous sex-on-the-airplane scene is there in all its turgid glory - but only minutes into the film there was an unexplainable cutting of a few seconds of scene and dialogue when Bisset and Bergen are running in 1959 for the train. Bergen explains that Doug was first Bisset's date, and then there's a sharp cut in the scene. I took out the DVD, popped in my old video version, replayed the scene, and sure enough Bisset explains, out of breath, that Doug was only a blind date. Not a pivotal moment, but still, I expect the entire film to be on a DVD. I was angrily reminded of DVDs of television shows (like ""Laverne & Shirley"") I've purchased that have similar cuts. Unfortunately there are probably other cuts in ""Rich and Famous"", and there should be none. A letter of complaint to the DVD-makers is probably in order. What a disappointment for long-patient fans of the film."
1,Where's a DVD COMPLETE version AND why not?,"I only know what I've read below... I also know that I saw the ""real deal"" and would give it FIVE STARS ... Maybe if NO ONE bought the VHS version, notified ""Wormers"" (Warners) re: the reason.... since I'm sure it comes down to some legal fight, which translates to $. So, when people talk and their money walks... THE REAL VERSION maybe released IN ITS ENTIRITY. Until then - tell the studios to put these attempts to placate ""where the 'money' don't shine""."
1,No DVD Yet?,"Every New Year's Eve I think of the final scene of this film and want to watch it again propped up in front of a roaring fire, champagne glass in hand. Each year I come here to look for it hoping to find that it has been released on DVD so I can celebrate by throwing this truly horrible VHS version in the fire. 2007, 2008, 2009? There are so many worthless things being released. How can this gem be overlooked year after year?"
5,Hopefully uncut,"This had better be the uncut original theatrical version, and not the laundered M-G-M VHS version that was released several years ago. I stupidly bought that, without reading the on-line reviews, and was dumbfounded at the ten minutes worth of trims. Hello, there's worse than what was cut on commercial television. I won't buy the DVD until someone reviews it here, confirming that it is the complete version of George Cukor's last movie!"
5,Oldie but goodie,"Thoroughly enjoyed it, Had seen this movie back when it first came out. It was good then but just as good now. Candace and Jacqueline are both class acts."
4,A Roast of Rhode Island,"RhodeIslandiana is a humorous satire of Rhode Island. It is a contemporary and historical miscellany written as memoir. The incidents have been collected from more than thirty-five years of observation. The book is a roast of Rhode Island with the serious intent of reform of a culture of corruption but in which humor predominates---and expressed in a drollery that befits the state. All the episodes are true and really happened. Rhode Island is a funny place. This is not known among the states of the Union. Some Americans doubt that it is legally a state, and suppose it to be an aprocryphal small place. RhodeIslandiana resolves the issue with panache."
3,Average Soundtrack from an Average Musical.,"LOVELY TO LOOK AT is an example of a musical typical of the style of film when it was made. The only thing really significant about the soundtrack is that it has Red Skelton singing on several of the songs. Other than that, that's about it. I own a ton of movie soundtracks and more often than not enjoy musical soundtracks. However, there really isn't anything here that is outstanding. It's an average album from an average musical. I only recommend getting this album if you're a fan of the movie or if you are a major Red Skelton fan."
4,"Decent, fun, and entertaining",This is not a book for learning Greek myths so much as it is for having fun reading a myth-book. He leaves some details out and uses lots of modern-day metaphors to describe how the Greek Gods lived.
3,Disappointing,"This was a strangely disappointing purchase. Given Robert Graves's reputation and his poetic background, I would have expected something that was concise but lyrical and engaging. Instead, while this book does seem precise and organized, it comes across more as vehicle for efficient information transfer than a collection of some of the world's greatest stories told by one of the world's great storytellers. The tone is dry, even mundane, and sucks much of the drama and power out of the myths - eg, this happened, then this, then this, then he/she died, the end. Oddly short on the sort of language and narrative arc that generally make myths exciting and memorable."
3,Good intro and excellent for overviews.,"I gave a lower rating as I need more background information. The book does exactly what it says: give you an overview and an introduction to Greek mythology. It's a very raw form of introducing the novelty reader to the material and meets that need well. I agree with a previous commenter who stated it's great for kids and teens.Regardless, this should be in your shelf as a reference."
4,Decent Kneepad,"I never had another kneepad, so I can't compare it with other kneepads. But this product worked fine for me and was surprisingly comfortable. It was also machine washable, which was a big plus. I deducted one star because after the first wash, some of the threads came loose a little."
1,Poor print quality,"The work of Jeans is great but the reproduction quality was poor. Also, there were many markings in the original they copied from that should have been erased, or they should have found a better original. I should have purchased an old original version."
3,Quick Read - Basic Info,"If you're looking for a book you can pound through in a few days, and some tips to improve casual jam sessions with buddies...then this book will probably do the trick.The author provides basic progressions, some decent riffs and solos, and rythms. He also provides info on blues artists, and stuff like how to ""look"" like a blues musician - all of which I could have done without since I was just looking for a quick read to help me sound like I know what I'm doing while jamming with friends.In all, the book helped me do that, and stays true to it's title...faking that you know what you're doing."
5,Deep & Satisfying,"Street by street, a plague of despair and lethargy is slowly consuming the city of Viriconium. Neither cause nor cure is obvious. Is it the art dealer Paulinus Rack, warping the artists of the Low City into sentimental hacks for the rich of the High City? Is it the Barley Brothers, the two drunken idiots who may or may not be gods? Or is it the murderous little dwarf, ""from the north or the sky,"" remaking a small quarter of the city for his own hidden reasons?As the third book in the Viriconium saga, The Floating Gods takes a different approach to themes it holds in common with the first two books in the series: the culmination and demise of art and science, a threatening invasion, and transformation. Our protagonist is a painter instead of a warrior. As with all of Harrison's work, The Floating Gods is exceptionally well written, short, and satisfying to no end; the kind of book that benefits from multiple readings. I heartily recommend the entire Viriconium series."
4,Only if your a fan,"Yeah, this is a good movie if you a like that sort of music, so it's was pretty good"
5,A story that is both entertaining and inspiring,"With her flair for detail, Lori Paris takes you right where she wants you to be--right into the thoughts and life of Sara Martin. You will feel Sara's grief in losing those she loves and with the loss of identity when she discovers that she is adopted. You will feel her joy when she realizes her strengths and 'will not quit' character which helps her move forward into romance, meaningful relationships and determination to find her birth parents. This story will touch your heart and inspire you to move forward."
1,Don't buy this book...,"This book is NOT an ""Introduction"" to Genetic Algorithms. It is an academia blathering about genetic algorithms citing mostly other people's work with no practical examples. If you are looking to actually get some program code up and running to experiment with genetic algorithms, this is NOT the book to get. If you are a professor searching for a GA book to use in your classes, please do not select this one. Your students will hate your class.However, if you are looking for a discussion of some variations of genetic algorithm approaches to solving various problems from a higher level perspective, it might be worth a read. I realize this review may seem harsh, but when a book is so completely mis-titled it is misleading. This book is written for people with a thorough knowledge of genetic algorithm use already."
2,Introduction ... for Researchers Maybe,I have to agree with all of johnnied7 criticisms. This book is pitched at a level too advanced for an introduction. It also reads and is structured like a research paper. Not recommended.
1,Rather mediocre,This book is a bland and rather disappointing volume. Try the Chan Encyclopedia instead
1,"A Boring, arrogant American Snob...","The Author of this book is the type of person that gives Americans a bad name.A borish, racist, ignornant leftist that tounge and cheeks her way through racist and ignorant comments on a culture she obviously nows nothing about.If you like snoody, rich, white, elitists accounts of 'indian country' then by all means waste your money."
2,A Pulitzer???,I had high hopes for this book but was sadly disappointed. Read this book if you want to study long long sentence construction. Each sentence was a test of my concentration. The story however did warrant this much effort. Perhaps Pulitzer is a reward for the most number of words with the fewest periods? I gave up.
2,One D Thing After Another,Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with.
3,Independence Day too confusing for teens?,"The story ""Independence Day"" is about a man named Frank Bascombe living life trying only to get through with a good attitude. He deals with normal problems that most people have to deal with, such as moving, divorce, and jobs. His wife divorced him and moved to Connecticut and also took his kids with her. For the most part, Frank is happy, but he does go through some tough times and hardships. He has very high hopes for this upcoming 4th of July weekend. He plans to pick up his son and then plans to take him to see as many sports halls of fame as they can in two days. Personally, I didn't enjoy the book too much; I thought that the story line was a little too hard to follow. If anything, I would recommend this book to adults and not teenagers or children. I gave this book three stars out of five."
3,Frustration With Part 2 of the Trilogy,"I am not sure why this is an award winning book. Mr. Ford develops a host of characters. He provides multiple story lines. I enjoy Ford's observations on life. He reminds me of Woody Allen in the way that he expresses his beliefs through his work. He leads me along just well enough to keep me interested while also keeping me frustrated with characters that seem to go nowhere described in sentences with lots of commas and jumbled, meandering thoughts that are difficult to follow and require much rereading to grasp. There are a few parts of the story that just do not seem believable. Part 1 of the series definitely seemed more focused."
2,Wordy,"Arduous reading. And wordy-lordy! Maybe I just missed the comedy that is referenced in the reviews, but I didn't smile once. That's ok, but neither did I see any redemption. I'll grant you that it has insight, but it's bleak and depressing. Maybe I am at the wrong stage of my life (mid 30's, one 2 yr old) to sufficiently appreciate it. Also, I read it immediately after a Vonnegut novel (Bluebeard, which was pretty good), which is kind of anti-wordy and has more obvious humor, and so on."
1,Boring.,"Yes, Richard Ford can construct a nice sentence and he has a fine command of the English language. However, if this book is an example of his story-telling abilities, he's missing the boat. Other reviewers have gone into depth, describing the plot and characters, why they liked or disliked them. I'm not interested enough to do that. Basically, this book was boring. I cared nothing about any of the characters and there was NO plot. So, unless you enjoy reading about a 40-something year-old-man who analyzes everything from the state of the real estate market, to a bus load of Canadians in a truck stop, don't waste your time."
1,Most boring book I have ever read.,"If the purpose of this book was to make the reader experience three of the most boring days, in the most excruciating details, with a pompus, pretentious, and simpleminded idiot, it was a success. I couldn't stand this book. And I didn't even have to read it, I listened to it on tape. After 5 tapes I skiped to the 10th, then quickly to the last tape. I don't feel as though I missed out ony any important information in the book, just my life. What a waste of my time."
1,A Pulitizer for this???,"Frank never collects his rent. He works too hard for nothing. He helps people out only to endure their contempt. The book is filled with descriptive prose that goes no place slowly. A great many characters are introduced who don't figure. A great many words are written alluding to something that is to happen many pages away, and it fizzles. The book just fizzles. The hero is emotionally crippled and he just stays that way. A better title would have been The Frog Pond, because he's waiting for someone (a woman) to fish him out."
5,Just A Little At A Time,"So many books are ones which ""I just couldn't put down"" but our lives rarely allow us to focus like that - we have all kinds of little things that require our attention. This books reads like the pull and push of our lives and you can take a little in at a time, go on to something else you need to do and then return as naturally as we do in our actual lives. I have rarely had that kind of experience with a book. Thanks."
3,Lack of Chemistry?,"This is the story of Frank Bascombe's transition from his Existence Period to his Permanent Period, neither term I entirely understand, even after 450 pages.An interesting, life-like aspect of Frank is that he seems to be a different person in his life than when he's narrating the story. As Frank's hot-dog vendor employee says, ""Frank, you seem one way and are another."" And so we all are. Frank's not the most likable guy in the world, but he's real, with real, believable concerns about his life.The book just didn't click with me. Maybe I'm too young at 37 to understand the Existence Period, maybe I just wanted something (anything!) to happen. So though I liked the book's style (similar to a favorite author, John Updike), I'm still left unsatisfied."
5,A wonderful book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There are scenes of laugh out loud hilarity. A truly great novel.
5,A Classic of the Modern Voice,"Independence Day is the sequel to The Sportswriter, Ford's brilliant narrative on the present and past life of Frank Bascombe. In Independence Day, Bascombe's life has succumbed to the inevitable - change. His ex-wife and kids have moved away, he has a new career, a new house, a new girlfriend, and he's five years older. Though along with this change, he tries his damnedest to cling to the comforts of the past while navigating the present and fending off the future - his ""Existence Period.""As with The Sportswriter, Ford masterfully blends the story and dialogue, while unlike The Sportswriter, he doesn't need to rely on the flashback to fill in the blanks. Whereas they have a common thread, Independence Day stands on its own and shines and can certainly be regarded as a masterpiece of modern literature."
3,Stirring capture of human desire in turmoil,I found this book well written but lacking direction. The author describes a man torn with the realities of life and trying to make sense of the life he is leading. Beautifully written vignettes of the characters despite what I said about the direction of the book.
2,Emotionally threadbare account of a non-pivotal moment.,"The book lacks any of the richness we associate with fine novels.One character dominates the book, and everyone else is filtered through his self deluded know-all understand- all sensibility. The great moment which is supposed to signal the end of Frank's existence period is underwhelming. Some good descriptions of small-town ambience may be the best part of what is otherwise the portrait of a remarkably passive and uninteresting person. There had better be a better novel on contemporary life being written out there"
2,"A long, weary slog.","Tedious, overwritten and overlong, Independence Day tackles one great theme; the existential human predicament of 'being in the world in time' and misses the mark by miles. To centre one man's crisis around two or three relatively mundane situations is risk enough, and Ford is no E.M. Forster. He lacks the subtle judgement that Forster used to sustain the narrative structure and his use of language, though often clever and evocative disappears in a mire of inaction. This is a hard book to get through, partly because of backward nods in the direction of experimental fiction but mainly because of its length and lack of narrative pointers. Ford's descriptive talents are good and his characterization excellent, but character development over 450 pages isn't much of a challenge if that's all you're doing. Where's the novel?"
2,"Who are these ""Judges"" that hand out the Pulitzer?","I admit it. I read a mere hundred and fifty pages of this book which I feel is as heroic a gesture as I'm capable of. A hundred and fifty pages of epilogue. A novel in which the major events have already taken place, leaving one the feeling of getting to the ball park just after the last pitch is thrown. Reading this gobbler is like listening to a lousy comic explain why his mirthless jokes are funny. Dull events, lifeless people. Another middle aged man's apology for the boredom and confusion he inflicts on himself and others.Humorless and filled with pointless observations. Life is too short for this kind of ""literature"". I quit."
5,wondrous writing-modern day Ulysses,"Originally, I felt this book was worth only 3.5 stars, but the language keeps coming back to me. This is a book that at first glance seems boring and superficial, but a second look reveals that Mr. Ford's writing captures life in the late 20th century ... life not as wild events, but life though the experiences of several Americans who are ""normal"" people. The writing is delicious."
4,Meet the author,"I read Ford's Independence Day after he came to my University to do a reading. I hate to admit I didn't read the book before his reading because I thought it would be boring, but through his readings, the subtle humor of the work comes through which may be hard for some readers to extract from words on a page. A must read, I only wish great books weren't so predctably ironic or depressing. A suggestion for those who didn't get it the first time through would be the audio tape."
2,Too much pathos,"By the time I was half-way through with this book I no longer cared about the main character Frank Bascome. He seemed so self-absorbed and frankly whiny. The writing is excellent but I don't understand how I am supposed to relate to this person who seems so out of touch with every other person he comes in contact with. He doesn't understand his clients, his ex-wife, his maybe-girlfriend, his son. I just don't find the writing to be Pulitzer Prize material unless, like some modern art, it was meant to be above all of us plebeian readers. If this is my problem, I accept that but I read to be entertained, not to have to analyze each sentence."
5,Why Does Amazon Let Readers Review?,"When I see award winning authors getting 1 star reviews from Amazon customers, and it usually includes some lame, scathing review, it makes me wonder why they (Amazon customers) are allowed to voice their opinions at all. If you fall asleep reading a Pultizer Prize winning book, you probably are sleep deprived. You try writing a book and see how difficult it is develop plot and strong characters."
1,S Riden claims this is JUST NOT ENOUGH,"I read Ford because he's the son of our 38th president, my personal favorite. But Ford (the author) just not up there with the Clancies and the Krytons. Firstly, this is no companion piece to Born on the Fourth of July (Kovacs), whatever anyone says. That's misleading. That's just a lot of chin music, nothing else. Ford gets compared to Hemingway sometimes, but Independence Day is nowhere near as good as The Sun Rises, too. Just hooey with a capital H. Absolute hooey."
1,OMG this book sux,I had to read this book and it made me so bored i fell asleep at the wheel just thinking about it. This book totally sux.
5,Excellent Read!,Excellent read - so well written! Kept me involved from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book. Peter Haggart
2,Amazingly bad excuse for a sequel,"After reading the authors first book, I just could not read this one. I was very dissapointed. One character dominates the whole story line whereas the other characters are just nobody's. I would not really recommend this book for anyone to read unless you are going of somewhere and have nothing to do"
3,long short story,"There are isolated moments of real insight here and it's a shame they're lost in such a meandering, pointless story. The book is strongest when it shows the impact that a realtor has on the lives of his clients -- something I hadn't really considered previously. The story of the Markhams, how the compromises they must make in settling for the home they can afford instead of the one they really want is a powerful metaphor for the lives of these two people, for the choices they've made and how they will live out their remaining years. It's about making tough decisions and being honest about yourself and your situation in life. I would have loved to see this as a short story. Unfortunately, the novel has little else to offer. The protagonist's insights into his own life are fairly shallow and repetitive (if I had to read the term ""Existence Period"" one more time I was going to put the book down for good). Pulitzer prize? Come on."
3,middle aged male angst; it has been covered better elsewhere,"There are many fine books, such as 'Revolutionary Road' and the ""Rabbit"" [John Updike], that cover the sad, confused life of middle aged American men. Somehow the American dream seems clouded for these people. 'Independence Day' shares this same theme. We have a divorced realtor in New Jersey who takes his son on a male bonding trip for the July 4th holiday. We learn all about this guy's ups and downs, his strengths and weaknesses, etc. It is all very introspective and brooding. Insightful? Sort of, but it is also extremely tedious. Despite being very well written I was glad when I finally read the last page of this book.Bottom line: proof that fine literature can be total downers. Not recommended."
2,Zzzzzz...,"I tried with this one too, I really did, but I couldn't get through the first one hundred pages of this book for the life of me. After two different tries I must say that this is the most boring novel I have ever read, and that's a difficult thing for me to say. I have always been able to hold my own with literature, past and present. I waded through ""War and Peace"" with relative ease. I LOVED the heavily-interior ""The Scarlet Letter"" and other older, canonical works, but this one didn't have anything interesting whatsoever in it. Only invest your time in something you could get insight, entertainment and pleasure from, not this 450-page snoozefest."
5,A Great Work of Art,"Richard Ford just has a writer's skill for putting exactly what the the human mind is thinking into words. He captivates the reader with his mixture of humor, sadness, and occasionally, sexual themes. He is a truly astounding writer with amazing talent, and I can't wait till his next book comes out. READ THIS, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
1,Kindle version full of typos,"The writing is excellent and the story is compelling. However, the Kindle version is full of typos that should have been obvious."
4,"Literature, not popular fiction","I laughed out loud, I stopped to think about what I had just read, I looked up some words in the dictionary, I paused to remember my college Emerson and Shakespeare when the author referenced them, I reflected on my marriage and my parenting, I highlighted areas in the text, I will recommend this to friends who are serious readers. It is a serious book and deserving of the honor bestowed by the Pulitzer committee."
5,"This cd is waiting to be disocvered, by you........",I have wanted to buy this cd for sometime. Well that wait is finally over. I have bought it and just about worn it out in the short time that I have owned it. This is a MARVELIOUS cd. You must own this cd if you are a romantic and love the sound of beautiful music.Wayne seems to play with emotion and a lot of love fom his heart. I know that he must be one of us romantics. He has a wonderful touch on the ivories. I think that he might be one of the best kept secrets around.Please do yourself a favor and fall in love again with this beautiful music. I promise it is that good!
5,"Pau Casals, the Universal Catalan Cello Player","It is sad that the universal Catalan PAU CASALS is remembered with the Spanish name 'Pablo'. I still remember his speech at the United Nations proclaiming his love fro Catalonia, a country devastated by the Spain of Franco, who prohibited and prosecuted the use of the Catalan language. Anyhow ... this recording is a must!"
3,Guitar Genious,"For me, Cassals can play what ever he wants and I will like it. WHY? say you? Because the spaniard had an enormous amount of talent. Let's say like the ""Midas"" touch of music. Cassals always went out of his way to perform his best. So much so that many times he surprised himself doin it so. highly recommended CD. Elegant, classy, easy listening but with gusto and above all passion, the Bach style in Cassals fingertips.. Enjoy"
1,second disc skips,Very unsatisfied. The second disc skips and is totally unuseable. I don't have the time or patience to try and return the item.
5,Great ideas,I have used this book in my classroom and it really helps to spark ideas. I teach high school and this book translates well to upper levels.
1,Would not work on my Brother MFC 420 CN printer,"I ordered the 8 pack of these from Factory Depot. Only about 3 of the 8 cartridges worked, the rest dried up and clogged the print heads. Some would not work at all, some worked once and never again. Factory Depot said it wasn't their fault, but said they would refund my money. We'll see if that happens. I had used other generic LC41 cargridges with no problem, but this brand are just no good."
2,POOR QUALITY,"It has poor color quality.Good for little children while they play on computer ,they can print and color."
3,Brother ink cartridge substitute,"I buy these cartridges as a substitute for genuine Brother ink cartridges which are ridiculously high in cost. There is a tendency for the plastic body of the cartridge to leak a bit when opened and that sometimes means you get inky fingers when you switch cartridges.The cartridges do not seem to last as long as the genuine Brother cartridges do. The ink quality in these cartridges is good, but has a tendency to fade a little more when exposed to continual direct sunlight than the Brother ink does.Even with these drawbacks, they are still a better-than-acceptable substitute when you can get them for a smoking price. The thing that really bugs me is the obscenely high shipping fee. I include the shipping in my cost comparison and still come out quite a bit ahead. But these are small ink cartridges. Shipping per unit is too high.Overall with ""C"" being average, I would rate these a ""B-/C+"" experience."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I got these ink cartridges and they had a tag on them that showed a picture for this tag to be removed. When I pulled the tag off it exposed a hole and the ink was under pressure so it sprayed all over my hands, computer, computer speakers, monitor, desk, and hands. I went ahead and installed the cartridges and when I tried to print I got a blank page. I tried several cleaning cycles and still blank pages. Now I have ink all over my hands that won't come off and cartridges that will not print.UPDATE: I put in the second set of cartridges without pulling the yellow tab. Still get a blank page when printing. Absolute garbage."
1,Not a Good purchase,I had loved the price so I purchased 4 sets to start. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!!! Not one of the yellow work. three red leaked in shipping and three blue registered as empty after 4 pages.Find another supplierBuiyer Beware!
4,Great priced ink,I hesitated to buy this ink being that it was so cheap but I'm pleased to say that it has worked out really well and I'll be buying it again!
1,"Says Free Shipping, but then they charge you in the shopping cart","Product description says Free Shipping. I put it in my cart, was about to order, and guess what...shipping is more than the product itself...plus they charge tax."
4,Great bargain ink,The ink cartridges were as promised and appear to be working fine after a good head cleaning. One of the 8 could not be detected by the printer but the seller immediately sent a replacement one that worked fine.
3,I was shorted...,I wasn't completely satisfied with the ink I purchased because one of ink cartridges was empty. I guess you get what you pay for since I only paid less than $10 for 8 cartridges. I know not to order recycled ink any more. At least one of the cartridges I needed had ink in it. I will still purchase goods from Amazon but not ink.
4,Be carefull,"I just bought two sets and they work great, the thing is the are no instructions for installation. I had to remove a little plastic cap for the black cartridge after a while of not knowing how to install it."
4,Printer Ink,"Ink came on time, good thus far for regular printing. Have no complains. Good price also."
3,not exactly compatible with the original,"Ink cartridge should have 2 cirles with a dot in the center in the bottom of cartridge. The one that I bought has only one. Printer is very sensitive to use a generic one, it should copycat exactly the original otherwise would create damage to my printer and it did. My printer is dead now! not only so, I had to pay 2 ways of shipping charges. It is not fair for consumers, especially we do not see the full image of the product.Beside the above problem, the services was very prompt and courteous."
5,fast delivery & works well,"The product is great! Works just as well as Brother brand ink, but at a reasonable price. Delivery very quickly! Will definitely purchase from this vendor again."
3,Not The Brand of Ink Displayed,"I ordered this ink based upon the BRAND of ink displayed on the page. I had used the displayed brand previously, and found it to be satisfactory. It was on this basis that I ordered the ink from this vendor.When I received my order, I found the brand of ink to be different than that displayed. I have not yet used this new ink so I do not know how it will perform. Hopefully, it will not cause printing problems.I am just disappointed that the vendor did not display on the product page the brand of ink they are actually selling."
1,Not compatible with Brother,"I am very disappointed with the product. It does not work properly with my Brother printer. After initial installation, it smeared the printout, making the print letters fuzzy. This is my first time and last time to try this product!"
4,Printer cartridge replacement,"Seems to be just as good as OEM, but they do look a little different. Print good, no complaints."
1,What's the tab for??,"I may change this later, but I received the ink cartridges and I noticed a pull tab on them with some sort of cryptic icon about what to do. No instructions. No directions. Nothing. My OEM cartridges do not have this tab so I have no clue what its for or whether or not its supposed to be pulled off or not. I pulled one off, which squirted ink onto me and left what appears to be a gaping hole. Is it supposed to be there? Some sort of instructions would have been nice."
3,Great Value for the price but does not last long.,"I will buy this in again. Works in my Brother printer. The ink quality is good and color prints out well however, the ink seems to get used up a lot quicker but for the price, I'm not complaining. The only thing I noticed when loading it was that it was a little harder for my printer to recognize the newly replaced cartridge."
2,Not at all like the picture,"I used the G & G brother compatible black ink before it was exactly as those shown in the picture (other than it is black) and it was great. The product I received this time, however, is completely different from the picture. They are not individually boxed, not G&G; branded and the sealing of the individual cartridges are very sloppy. It was like someone just throw 8 cartridges into a plastic bag, seal them and ship. The most disappointing part is the black cartridge is definitely smaller than an LC-65 and probably is just a LC-61. I did fit my 2270DW and so, I decided to keep it for convenience.So, one star deducted for not matching the picture, one for sloppy packaging and one for smaller size. The test page did come out okay though, so 2 stars."
3,Sent the wrong item but refunded quickly,They sent the wrong item which was a drag because I kinda needed to use my printer but they refunded me and sent call tags very quickly so I was ok with the transaction overall.
1,"Only Six Cartridges, Yellow Missing","I only received six cartridges, two each of black, magenta and blue. No yellow. It was cheap enough that it's really not worth following up with it. I'll find some other way to complete the printing I was going to do. Not happy."
1,"Didn't Work, and Leaked All Over","I wouldn't use these again even if they were free. After I installed the first cartridge, the printing results were very poor. I ran the printer's clean cycle several times and printed several normal pages. The results didn't improve. It looked to me like the print head was clogged. I thought I had ruined my printer.Then, I put a brand-name Brother cartridge in and everything immediately worked fine.When I removed the bad cartridge, it dripped ink inside the printer, on my hands, and on my desk."
3,Not Bad,"Like everyone says, the amount of ink is pretty low, but so is the price. Also, the cartridge has a tendency to break easily, so be careful when removing from the printer. For the price, it's a good deal and works well."
1,Doesn't Work Well,I bought these for a Brother 5840CN printer. They look similar but have some distinctive differences. The printer didn't initially recognize the cartrideges when inserted. It took several resets to get them seen. Even after they were detected the printer is unable to read the correct amount of ink in each cartridge. This may be a problem later because the printer won't operate if it thinks any one of the cartridges are empty. When you remove the piece of tape that covers the ink reservoir hole ink can leak out. Color on photos definitely not as good. I won't buy these again.
4,Cheap and good,"This is my first time buying products like theses. Easy installation without any problems. The printing quality is fine. The only things I was little disappointed is the quantity if ink. For the prices of these, it is definitely worth it. Will buy again."
1,DISCRIPTION WRONG DOES NOT WORK WITH MY PRINTER!!!,"Based on the item discription this ink should have worked with my Brother MFC 420CN, well it doesn't. After receiving the ink I put it in my printer and absolutely nothing printed on the test page. I cleaned the printer and tried again, nothing. I called my computer tech serviceman to my home and had him look at my printer and see if there was something wrong and he said, Yeah you have the wrong ink!! He said I was lucky I didn't break my printer!! Sure this product is inexpensive and printer ink costs can add up but buy the name brand made for your printer, you never know what you're getting when you buy a generic one size fits all because, appearantly one size doesn't fit all!!"
1,Brother,"The quality of this product is poor. Some of the cartridges are leaking into the plastic wrapper, making them useless. In addition, the printer does not recognise the cartridge as valid"
1,Cheap but waste of money...,I bought this ink for my Brother MFC-420CN and it did not work. The ink was very inexpensive but did not work with my printer so it was a waste of my money. The item description states that it should work with my printer so I bought it and was very disappointed when it did not work.
1,PASS,The ink only came out as red when I printed... no matter what color I was trying to print. This was a waste of my money... I threw it way.
5,The work every bit as good as brother ink,I was nervous to use non name brand ink. Until my 8 yr old son learned how to print off the computer. So for budget sake I tried them. They work great I will never by brother brand ink again. They are a huge price savings and I don't notice any printing quality difference.
2,INK or PRINTER IS BAD,"Don't know if it's the ink or printer but the printer will not print. I get a faint light blue color on anything I try to print. Like I said I have not tried other ink and the printer was off for about a year plus, but I troubleshot the printer and did all kinds of cleaning and aligning. I don't have a good test to go off but if I had to do it again I probably would just spent the money on the brother ink. At least then I would be motivated to return it or get a new printer."
4,More Printing for a Lot Less,"I could have headed over to some office store (as I used to). Now, to save wherever I can, I check prices at Amazon. I got 8 Cartridges for my printer for less than 1 at the nearest Office chain (including free Prime shipping). They work fine and I did not need to take the time or use the energy (mine or other carbon based) to go to the store & return."
1,"Bad Ink, Waste of money","I just bought these thinking that these would work out fine. I just put in a new LC41 Y and it turns out that when I try to print pictures, Reds turn purple, Yellows and browns don't even seem brown, they're more like pink. Wouldn't recommend this. That's what you get for the low price, Cheap/Worst quality. STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Substandard,"Fantastic price - perhaps too fantastic as none of the cartridges actually worked. So cheap, not worth returning. Sometimes one must pay to learn..."
5,Good buy,Its worth of your $$$... It has some issue while installing it on my printer but not because of this product. I rate it 5. Its working absolutely fine with my printer.
3,Nice Alternative,This is a nice alternative for costly original replacements.Just keep some stock of these things since the cartridge empty when you need it very badly to work.I think they should put more ink volume in these replacement cartridges. I am putting only 3 stars for this reason.
2,Doesn't work with my printer,These cartridge are missing some little valve on the bottom and all the ink leaked out after installing. Although you get a lot of cartridge for the money but it didn't work for my printer.
4,Great value for the money,Can't beat the price. I got two of each for less than the price of one cartridge. Great value for the money. Second time I have bought this at Amazon. No regrets.
4,Great value for the price.,"I have the Brother MFC 210C and MFC 420CN, both of which use these type of cartridges. Bought these generic cartridges to save money and am in general very satisfied with them. Have used them for years. Very few problems. No problems with printer heads, and prints pretty much the same as with factory cartridges, but I should specify that most of my printing is simple black and white (legal documents). I have had one or two times over the years where the machines would not ""recognize"" one of these cartridges, but I have almost always been able to resolve this by simply reinstalling the cartridge. Recall once or maybe twice over the years where that did not work and I just threw the replacement cartridge away and used another. Still saving a lot of money. Very happy overall"
2,not recommended,This is an update. I found out problem when I use the second package(the black). although it is a new cartridge and full. It shows half full on monitor. then there is smear on every piece of paper i print. It is quality issues. It is not a good generic substitute.be aware. I think I ruin my printer nowthe price is really good. but run out very fast. definitely less than ad. it is ok if you do not use that much. otherwise need to order a lot.
5,We Save A Lot Of Money,"We save a lot of money on these cartridges. We do a lot of color photography in our garden and go through a ton of ink cartridges.Be sure to keep your ink heads clean. Occasionally, the printer does not recognize one of the cartridges and we simply toss it and pop in another one. Overall, we are satisfied with these cartridges."
1,Buy brand name,"I bought these for my 420CN and the result is constant clogs, and fuzzy pages. Even after repeated cleanings and calibrations, the quality is terrible. Next time, I'm buying from Brother."
1,Ink clogs,I thought this would work out okay using cheap ink to print kid's school papers and such. The first cartridge I used was not even recognized by my printer. Subsequent cartridges clog the ink jets frequently which causes me to change cartridges VERY frequently. I have thrown them all away and am back to the expensive stuff.
1,Don't Buy this item Buy Black n Decker,I used this item 5x. it stopped working I had to send it back.buy Black & Decker 4-in-1 Multi-Purpose Grill at Walmart. It is the exact same thing
1,"Good Idea, bad non-stick.","As has been mentioned in a previous review, the non-stick coating flakes off after a few uses. I was able to get replacements from the manufacturer, but the same thing happened with the replacements. After a few uses, the poor quality of the non-stick coating fails and makes this appliace a total waste of money and time."
1,useless,"This product fails to heat in the promised time. Pancakes and waffles don't brown. When I tried to make a grilled cheese sandwich, the cheese melted before the bread browned. The sandwiches were soggy and I'm still trying to get the cheese off the appliance. Moreover, the instructions are inadequate. There are no heat controls. Everything cooks at the same fairly low heat. I found this thing useless."
1,"This is a total piece of crap - Don't buy it, don't !!","I used the grill plates twice and the Non-stick coating peeled off.I thought I would try one more burger on the grill plates just an hour ago and this time the burger stuck fast to the ""Non-stick"" surface and to clean the stuck burger will probably result in another large area peeling off.I contacted Koolatron after the plates peeled but they never gave me the courtecy of a reply.A total waste of my retirement money.I give it no stars (though I had to click 1 star to complete this review) but feel they owe me 6 stars.Total Chef TCG08G-CA 4IN1 Sandwich, Waffle, Grill & Griddle"
