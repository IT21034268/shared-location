3,Definately a B-movie,"Watch this movie only if you like B-movies, because as a film by itself, it isn't very good. Graphics are laughable, and the dubbing at times was badly translated, not to mention the fact that the movie is clearly titled Dragonball, when the actual balls are refered to throughout the movie as ""dragon pearls."" The acting is worthy of daytime soap, and some of the make-up was a scary reminder of the 80's, but the movie is a fair representation of the anime series. Basically, do not buy this unless you have seen the series at some point, and can enjoy a b-movie."
1,"Ok, but not a very good movies","I really love dbz so I decided to watch this movie because it is based on dbz. dbz=dragonballz. well anyway, the dragonball are called dragon perls and it is just weird if you know dbz and other dragonball shows like dragonballz, dragonballgt and just plain dragonball. It took me a while to ajust to the settings and everything. I do not recomend this movie to people who truly know the world of dragonball because then you will get mixed up."
5,Brought me to Sam,"This was the first album that I have heard from Sam Phillips and my life has never been the same. I bought it on recommendation of a friend and have never regretted it. Full of songs of superb popcraft, striking lyrics are set to deceptively catchy melodies and the results do not disappoint. ""Go Down,"" ""Tripping Over Gravity,"" ""Where The Colors Don't Go,"" and the title track are not songs (or hooks) one wants to argue with and the rest of the album follows suit."
2,not my cup of tea,"I borrow the cd from my local library... i listened to every track but found some of them almost unbearably monotonic. for example the 12th track - Jygach Ooz Komuz - Kambarkan Folk Ensemble (try the preview) sounded like someone not playing music, but some types of machine. maybe i just need to get used to such music. and there are of course a few good songs. but overall i am disappointed by this collection."
2,"Cat loves it, but","My cat thinks this is the best toy he's ever seen. However, apart from the problem with the cat easily knocking it over, the toy began to develop problems within the first month.First the motor began to act strange, and wouldn't fully twirl around, getting stuck at points (different batteries didn't fix it). Also, our cat has learned how to break the string, requiring a never ending supply of new strings.Without these problems this would be a great toy. With them, I'd be reluctant to recommend it to anyone one. Broken strings are common with cat toys, but the problem with the motor has made it unusable. I may have just been unlucky, but this was my experience with it, and I'm not willing to spend more to find out."
1,Fragile,"Although the toy is great and our cat likes it very much, it's extremely fragile. After a few times the ""motor"" is not running properly any more. I've ordered a second one since I thought the problem was caused by coincidence, but the second one gave the same problems after 3 times use. All in all too expensive for the quality offered !"
3,"3 stars, but only because my cat likes the toy","my cat likes this toy a lot. she gets very excited to play with it. i think the toy is not well made - my cat frequently topples the toy even with the extra stabilizer that comes with the toy. the wand is also ripped off quite easily. if your cat is very gentle, this is the toy for it. otherwise, no."
3,"Fun toy, but.....","I left my cat playing with the 'mouse' while I left the room, and when I returned in a few minutes he had the cord wrapped around his neck and the more he pulled, the tighter it became. I feel I can never let him play with this unsupervised."
2,"Great toy, but......it doesn't last...motor breaks down....","My cats loved this toy, but it just doesn't last long... the motor burns out......I have replaced it three times because they love it....but, too expensive to keep buying the same inferior product. The motor is not good enough; burns out fast. Would be a great toy if it was re-worked. Too bad. Another thing they could do, is make the base more secure so it doesn't fall over."
2,"Nice idea, but...","Cat loved it but, it only lasted a day. The gear on the metal shaft that holds the wand stripped. I can't believe they didn't design in a way to allow slippage when the cat is holding down the toy at the end of the wand so that the motor isn't fighting the cat. The plastic teeth just gave away and there is no way to contact manufacturer for replacement parts that I know of. You can buy replacement wands but not a new gearbox or geatbox with motor. Very sad."
3,Panic Mouse,"I received the first one as a gift back eight years ago. It was electric and lasted about a year. The ones since then have been battery operated and with daily use of an hour, have lasted me anywhere from sixty to one hundred eighty days. I have bought many of these because my feline girls love to interact with their toy as I prepare for work every morning. I tire of buying new ones but I don't believe the girls will ever want to be without one. Petco no longer has them on the shelf, I can only find them on the internet now. Thanks, Pat"
3,Great Toy At First...,"Was an entertaining toy for my 2 cats (9yrs & 7yrs). My cats are very playful but seriously have a bad case of A.D.DThey played with this for about 45 minutes straight the first day it came and maybe an hour total since in the year we have owned it. They have gotten bored, they got used to the tricks and will catch the little mouse and hold on to it and kill it, so all you hear is the motor TRYING to work but the cats are holding it down!But, when they do play with it, it is entertaining for us to watch them play with it as it is for them to actually play! :)"
4,A great kid movie that honors friendship over romance,"If you are as tired as I am of all the typical Disney fare with the prince and princess riding off into the sunset, then this is the kid movie for you. It's a sort of post-modern fairy tale. I'm so glad to see a major studio put something slightly less formulaic out there and stop filling our kids' heads with unrealistic notions about love and romance. This movie, even with all its flights of fancy, is a nice antidote to the traditional happily-ever-after scenario, yet the ending is not unhappy -- just a bit surprising. To find happiness, this movie's three main characters have to relinquish their preconcieved notions about boys and romance in order to grow up a little bit. Bravo! Good performances by all. I agree with other reviewers who said it wasn't as enjoyable as 8 Below, but it was still a good movie to see and discuss with your kid."
4,Became a classic in our family,"After renting this DVD so much, we finally decided to buy it. Great story, with lots of fun. Didn't know JoJo could act until this movie!"
4,Aquamarine,My wife and I watched this and felt it is well done. Young teenage girls will enjoy it the most since the girls portrayed are that age. Two girls meet during their Summer vacation and discover a mermaid in the pool at the resort. They all become close friends and do what all teenage girls love to do.CA Luster
4,good girl movie,"This movie had our girls wishing they had blue streaks in their hair, and pretending to be mermaids for a few weeks after seeing this the first time. The only thing my 9 year old did not like is the story is nothing like the one in the book. The book even has the same picture as the DVD on the front, but the story is very different. She did appreciate both stories though, and have asked to watch it numerous times."
5,love it!!!,o.k. so i'm 35yrs old but i just love this movie. it reminds me of when i was a teenager.
4,Aquamarine,"Kid's movie, but I watched it twice with my grand daughter. The acting was quite good and the story was a fun journey with the mermaid and her adventures as a person. I recommend it to anyone and everyone."
3,Good movie for the kids.,This is one movie where the ending made a real difference to an otherwise cliche teen movie.
5,A Nicole Review,"Two best friends get exactly what they fish for in Aquamarine, a laugh-out-loud hilarious comedy about friendship! Emma Roberts, Sara Paxton and pop sensation JoJo star in an adventure that's ""the sweetest treat since Princess Diaries!""It's the end of summer and Claire (Roberts) and Hailey (JoJo) have a major problem. In just five days, Hailey's family is moving halfway around the world! These girls need a major miracle, and they get one in the form of Aquamarine, a beautiful mermaid who washes ashore in a late summer storm. Sweet but clueless to the ways of romance, she offers to grant the girls one wish if they help her find the boy of her dreams. But when they attempt to reel in the cute local lifeguard, the result is something none of them expect and they discover that sometimes what you wish for isn't what you really want after all!"
4,ChickFlick for 12 yr old Daughter,"I don't count. I'm the Dad. So, my eyes rolling matched her pre-teen eyes rolling, but it's a cute movie. If you got to watch one of these with your pre-teen daughter, might as well be this one.She loved it, and has watched it several times. Once was enough for Dad. haha!But then, I'm ""OLD""."
4,Aquarine,My eleven year old really enjoyed this movie. It is definitely age appropriate and even though it is an older movie stil enjoyable.
4,My Sister's Favorite DVD,"She goes to college. She watched this as a kid and has a sort of nostalgia for it. This is a really good price for Blu-ray. The video arrived promptly with Amazon Prime Shipping. The packaging was great and as pictured. I looked far and wide for this DVD. Various search engines failed to find a copy. Amazon, I was pleasantly surprised, actually still carries this item! The movie was made after all quite some time ago. I would purchase this again from here!"
3,Hmm... not the best but not the worst either,This is another form of a chick flick! now as a mermaid freak i am i though this movie would be awesome! well u would expect a personlike me to see it on the first day as i did. and boy what a waste of 30 bucks! i should of read reviews first. this is nothing likr the commercial explains. the plot of the whole mermaid finds true love cause her father does not believe it is terrrible. but the fact that a 13 year old girl and a 16 year old are ' best friends for eniternity ' just makes it more boring and unrealistic. emma roberts acting is low rate of 2 but jojo makes a great actress! sharar is beatufil as a mermaid and i must say even i laughed at the stupid stunts these girl do to get boys attention! please dont see this movie in theaters because u will be wasting a lot of money when u can just pay a buck and rent a chick flick of ' true love ' wait to rent it but that is my opinion.by: MovieGirl
2,aquamarine,"Aquamarinethis item said in the inquiry ""like a new"" i differ because it's have a various segment frozen, i need to change this movie. please let me know"
1,When was this a movie about Lesbians.....,"Oh yes, Totaly that was the intent. These three women are more then just friends and if you look between the scenes and the lines you can see it.Should have been rated R for Rotten Garbage."
4,"Sweet, innocent and entertaining","I watched this with a group of girls aged 6-9 and they all loved it. I will tell you what I would want to know if I were thinking of buying or renting this for my daughter: it is very sweet and innocent. The most these teens aspire to is to kiss the cute boy. There is no bad language, nudity, or ""suggestive"" situations, so I think it's appropriate for any age. I also liked the message that it's not all about boys; these girls end up defining love as friendship and loyalty to one's friends. It was also nice that one of the main characters ends up considering her mother's feelings in addition to her own."
3,Entertaining for early Teens or Tweens,"This was an OK movie for early Teen or Tween girls.I watched it with a 2 and 7 year old, and they were entertained."
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is amazing. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but as I listened, I became more aware of the quality of it. Although the entire album is great, I especially like track #10, ""In Your Presence"". The first few tracks are praiseworthy, but when you get to the worship...look out! I highly recommend this CD for anyone who just wants to bask in the Glory."
3,"Good Product, Bad Shipping","I ordered this whole grain teff in January, 2009 and I was looking forward to the shipment. To my dismay, the pack was not well padded and all but one of the four bags of teff burst in shipping. Thankfully, most of the grain was still in the bags when it arrived, but a lot had spilled out into the bottom of the shipping box. This shipment was all grains and several of the other bags of grain also leaked. After this experience, I will not be buying grain from Amazon again any time soon. Otherwise, though I had to rebag the grain, it seems fine."
5,Where is the DVD?,"I've been waiting for a while now and Amazon still says ""Out of Stock"" I saw the movie in Orlando and Loved it! Please Amazon get it in stock. Thank you........"
5,I think it is great.,In my opinion I think this is great. It has held bananas well and I put apples in the bowl.
5,great fruit stand,"The product is very sturdy and holds a good amount of fruit, plus it has great lines and is pleasing to the eye"
5,Stylish way to hold fruits and vegetables,"We had some wicker baskets to hold our fruits and vegetables, but this is much better. You can see what you have, spot rot and they seem to last longer when they get air circulation.What is important is to hang bananas so that their curve matches the curve of the holder, per the product photo. We found that this unit, plus the also-reviewed two-tiered stainless bowl, holds a pretty typical selection of fruits and vegetables.Well made, stylish and useful. It seems minimalistic enough to fit most any kitchen design. I like it."
1,Great if you like miniature fruit,"I bought this based on the picture and made the mistake of not carefully looking at the measurements. The picture shown must have miniature fruit because in reality, the bananas hang so low that they actually touch the fruit in the basket which makes the whole thing look kind of weird. I'm adding a picture with real, normal-sized bananas so you can see the comparison between the image on Amazon and how it really looks. It is also pretty flimsy and the hanger bends when you put fruit on it. I'm sending this back.If you usually buy those cute little bitty bananas, though, this would be perfect."
4,rating of fruit bowl,I believe this to be a very good product. I would like to see a little more spot welding to make it more sturdy. I love the design and would recommend it to everyone.
4,Love this - but largest hole in center of basket might be too big,"My husband was sick of me using a metal bowl to store fruit and purchased this for me as a gift. I LOVE the idea, BUT the center hole in the bottom is big enough for a clementine or a medium apple to fall through. It could use a slightly larger basket. This one probably holds one bag of apples, but if you have bananas hanging, your stacking ability will be limited. For the price, though, I do believe it is better than the aforementioned silver bowl."
1,Came Broken,"This product looked very nice, but arrived broken. There is a small weld that holds together 2 pieces of the bannana holder that had seperated. Perhaps if the packaging was better it may have been ok. But I would imagine it would have broken eventually during normal use."
5,Great fruit bowl!,I love this fruit bowl. It fits perfectly on my kitchen counter and I love that it includes a spot for hanging bananas!
4,Nice additional to the kitchen,"This is a nice combo piece for fruit, however, it is a little larger than I thought it would be based on the description. But overall, it's still good."
4,Good storage,The fruit bowl was purchased as a gift and i know it is being used as was intended. The recipient loves the bowl and i would recommend this to anyone as a usable item.
3,Hole in the bottom too big,"The smallest ring in the bottom of the bowl is too big. Anything smaller than a full-sized orange, like a Roma tomato or a clementine will fall through it onto the counter beneath. I acquired a small saucer to place in the bottom to solve the problem, but there needs to be one more smaller concentric ring in the bottom for this to get a better review."
5,Very Good Quality and Design,"As the title says, this fruit bowl has very good quality and great design. Looks great on the kitchen counter, holds all kinds of fruits and gives an adequate ventilation because of the open grill design to help the fruit stay fresh longer. So far, no bruises on my apples. An overall great buy and great value. It looks like it will hold up for many years."
2,"Bananas ripen other fruit, so be careful!","If you didn't already know this, bananas ripen other fruit more quickly. Although the design seems to be a great space-saver, this will cause your other fruit to go bad more quickly!"
3,Tips over!,"We've had to hang the bananas scooping inward (the opposite of the picture) to avoid the whole contraption falling over. I suspect that if the base was just a smidge larger, this would not be a concern."
4,One tiny nitpick with it,"This has been great for our kitchen for keeping fruit at hand. My one gripe with it is that the bottom of the bowl has a sizable gap in the center of it where they didn't bother to put another circular rod. As a result, anything about the size of a small peach or tomato tends to migrate there and sit on the counter rather than being elevated to allow the air circulation that keeps it from goign bad as fast. Otherwise, it's wonderful and looks nice on the counter top."
5,Smart Fruit Bowl,I love this bowl with the banana hanger. So important to keep fruit aerated. But also the hook allowed us to hang it from our Metro rack and save some valuable counter space.
4,"sturdy, nice looking","This wire fruit bowl is well made, and sturdy. Good balance. I have looked in stores and only found very cheap breakable plastic, or clunky wooden banana holders, so this was a nice surprise, good price."
2,Fruits smaller than Grapefruits may end up on the floor!!!,"All the people giving this product a 5-stars rating probably eat fruits bigger than grapefruits or try to modify the product to close 3"" diameter hole in the bottom of the fruit bowl. My plums, apricots, and nectarines all went through the hole as soon as I picked up the bowl. It is a poor design. OK, 2 stars for making it look pretty on the Amazon's picture. Feels cheap when you hold it in your hands. Thanks for Amazon's return policy."
2,Not worth it if shipping outside USA,"I wanted a fruit bowl with a banana hanger. Since I'm Canadian, I looked at the ones available at amazon.ca but alas, none had banana hangers! So I ended up stupidly paying $60 in total to ship a fruit bowl that would've cost an American $12.95 + shipping and handling. Ridiculous shipping fees! And of course, they don't provide a quote before you click buy! To add insult to injury, the item was poorly packed in a too large box and the banana hanger weld didn't hold. I had to use a clamp and krazy glue to get it back together. I feel like a fool. Caveat emptor indeed!"
2,Doesn't fly,"The premise of this novel is marvelous; Soraida, a quick thinking, sharp talking parrot defends her human family when they are summarily put on trial. The crime : character. In addition to mother, father and the two girls who watch all but say little, there is a dusty grandmother with chicken feathers on her eyelids. Uncle Jaime makes ""pointed brassieres that make adequate cat bowls"", while Uncle Rico is branded as ""incorrigle tango player, copious weeper"". Set in an unnamed South American country, this should be a book of color and delight. But, though fanciful, the characters are distant - there is little chance to meet them directly. And the magic of the talking parrot wanes as her crude and obscene insults increase."
5,Great product,I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter's room. It looks great on her wall and was very easy to put together! Holds up well too
3,"Baseball Shelf - Scratched, Odd Color, Missing Screws","We ordered the baseball shelf for our son's room. It was not packed well for shipping and arrived with scratches and gouges in a few places. The red is an odd shade, almost closer to fuschia than red. To top it off, it was missing a few screws. It looks cute put together, but we would not recommend this product."
3,Sorta 'new' joys of yiddish,"I hoped there'd me more actual language and less American-isms. But I get it now that I've read it - and the introductions. It was not intended as such. But I didn't really know that before I bought it. It's a classic, and I still really had fun with it."
3,Missing important items,"It left out some very wonderful terms and usages and stories from the original Joys of Yiddish, and that was disappointing to me."
5,The New Joys of Yiddish,excellent.howver I still like the ORIGINAL better. Are there any around?In essence this is informative.but I again say...the original was better.
5,Lerning about Yiddish,There are so many Yiddish words that are in the vernacular of the English language and many people ask me what the words mean. Now I can tell them.
3,Fiddleresque,"Found this is a New Bedford goodwill store for 10 cents. It has a lot of interesting info in it, but drenched in Fiddleresque sentimentality about Jewish expressiveness. One interesting theme is his ongoing campaign to claim disputed slangwords for Yiddish as opposed to German, Gaelic etc: fin, shamus.He barely touches one important subject -- the adoption of Yiddish syntax into slangy English, ""enough already,"" ""you should only live so long,"" etc."
1,sanitized for understandable reasons,"For example, for an honest translation and etymology of ""shaygetz"" or ""shiksa,"" see the Meggido Modern Hebrew-English Dictionary:""sheqetz: unclean animal, loathsome creature, abomination...."""
2,The Understated Joys of Yiddish,"Simplistic and without real scholarship, one wonders why this is the book that people chose for any kind of language enhancment of the joys of that most subtle and lovely of langauges."
3,"Too ""cute""","Academic setting. Good plot. Well-drawn characters. Nice touches of humor. What's not to Like?Well the hero, Gervase Fen, for one thing. He has the arrogant intellectually superior attitude of the early Ellery Queen -- ""I'm so smart that I know the solution but I won't tell you, nayh, nayh, nayh"" -- that puts himself and others in peril.Also while the plot is good, it is so overly complex (it takes a 20 page next-to-last chapter for Fen to explain it all) that I found myself saying ""Give me a break"". Yes, Sherlock Holmes can get away with this kind of plot, but mere mortals should avoid them. Moreover, the two action scenes (in the woods and the car chase) do not work for me -- they are somewhat hackneyed and the overlaying of humor seems forced."
1,Amazon removing many bad review - buyer beware,Typing yet another review as they remove many bad ones mentioning the severe echo on line 2 making this phone useless.I imagine it makes it hard to sell. If you do buy this phone line 2 will be useless forcing you to buy another phone for line 2. If thats what you have to do why buy this one in the first place?
1,Interchangability limited,"I have a TRU 9485, and thought I would upgrade to a two line system. Beware, because Uniden has made the handsets not interchangeable. The add-on TCX-905 is, but the handsets sold with bases are not. So your ability to expand, combine or otherwise interchange handsets has been limited by Uniden.BTW, no where in the Uniden literature did I find notice that the handsets are not interchangeable."
3,Not a wall phone!,This phone seemed nice but certainly would not fit where most wall phones would be mounted. It protrudes too far into a traffic area.
1,Can't work with international caller ID,"In spite of all the wonderful features of this phone which are quite impressive I found that this phone is 100% useless to me as I receive international phone calls and none of the Uniden phones show the country code in the caller ID display. I ended up getting an ATT phone That does show the country code. This is also a nuisance when adding numbers from your caller ID as it will not show the number 1 for the USA country code unless you push the * button, which isn't so bad if you can remember to do that. So if you do international business and use caller ID, this is not the phone for you."
1,Never buy this product,"I shouldn't even rate this phone one star. Some features I was looking for like 2 lines, wireless, speaker were ok, but after reading the discription a little closer, It did not have an answer machine. It is programable to use the Telo answering phone feature. Another issue I had,when using the phone, was while on one line and the other line rings, the ring was outloud during my converation from the other line, while I was on a conference call, so everyone on the conference heard it.Needless to say I sent it back."
4,"Good phone, but be careful","Overall I'm pleased with this phone, but three minor issues.1) The first phone base I received didn't work worth a damn. Tons of static and a range of around 10ft. So I took it back and demanded a exchance. The second one worked like a champ. The only problem seemed to be the emitter in the base unit.2) In our situation we have two lines both with their own vmail accounts. There is no way to tell which mail account has the vmail from the phone base. So essentially if you have a voicemail(s), you need to either listen for the tone skip on both lines or call each one since you may have a vmail on L1, L2, or both. This is rather silly, but compared to the other phones in the market, it is worth the tradeoffs.3) The vmail indicator seems to have a rather long delay before reseting. Seems like a simple thing, but has some hiccups."
3,Great Product However....,"This cordless system has great features. I like Uniden products. I loved the fact that I could have a cordless handset with charger in my kitchen. The answering machine worked great. I could access my messages from a remote location.However, I noticed with my last two Uniden products the handsets malfunctioned after a year. Certain buttons ceased to function. On the TRU9466 the large button in the middle to access the phone book and numbers in memory stopped working on both phones.I could still talk and redial the last number but I needed that button to access phone numbers. I know many of us don't memorize numbers any more and not having that feature to recall the numbers was frustrating.I don't know if I will be purchasing another.I would like to add there is only one adult in my HH and no children. So the phone was not abused."
5,Very satisfied!!,"Very durable, good sound and the 3 phones are perfect for my home. I have one upstairs and two downstairs. They have gotten through so much abuse and are still ticking. Imagine having 3 teenage boys!Definitely a great buy!!"
4,excellent features and value,"There are very few cordless phones for 2 lines and none that I have owned work as well as this Uniden set. Very easy to add information, update phones, add a new phone, use the caller ID and easily put calls on hold and pick up from another handset. Really like the Do Not Disturb button that routes all incoming calls to voice mail.I have had Uniden products in the past and found them to be quite reliable except for the NiCad batteries that last less than a year and are quite expensive to replace. This set uses NiMh batteries and I have individual handsets that have been in use for 18 months an still work great in terms of their holding a charge."
4,Pretty good phone,"We got this phone for a 79 year old man with 2 phone lines. The numbers are large and the display is also large so that he can see it better. The downside is that it does not have an answering machine, rather, it uses voicemail through the phone company to do that."
4,It is what I needed except for one thing,"I have used this phone for only two days now. It was easy to set up. It was easy to enter phone numbers into the phone book. The sound is acceptable. The range is suitable for my needs.The only thing I have found so far that I dislike, assuming I didn't miss something in the manual, is the fact the banner on the handset and base are dark unless a button has been pushed. The Panasonic I had before was not so dark when not being used that I could not see it. If I have been out of my home office and come back in, I like to be able to see if there have been any incoming calls while I was away. Simply cannot do it with this phone."
4,Good Range,"Very nice unit, which I have with the extra handset. Really no complaints on the unit, if it had (it never claimed it did) an answering machine, it would have been perfect. Comfortable feel handset, clean sound, easily programmed and long lasting battery power."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE bf READING THIS,"read all over the internet about this phone to ensure I wasn't making a mistake. Well I did the line 1 echoes and after ensuring it was not my phone provider, I typed in the model number and the word echo. I found lots of people have had the same problem that I did right out of the box. I tried to contact Uniden support which they responded within 2 days expect gave me info that didn't resolve my problem, so I told them that what they said did not resolve my problem, they replied with hours with a solution which didn't work. I would not purchase this product."
2,Frequent freezes require unplugging battery,"A very good phone, but the handset freezes and has to be rebooted, like a bad operating system. You disconnect the handset from the battery for a few seconds, plug it in again, and then recharge it, and you love the phone till it happens again, which it does. Two Stars."
5,5 years later - Still a great system.,"I just dropped one of my handsets again on the concrete shop floor and I thought I should write how durable these things are. They are great! We have three regular ones in a relatively dusty plastics shop and they have hit the concrete countless times, tumbled down stairs etc. One gives us the occasional complaint due to this but the rest are still in original working order.Sound it fine for us in a noisy business environment so office users should look at other reviews.Cheers."
5,Superb Azucar Moreno,"This one was Azucar Moreno's real first big album, and the only thing I'd like to say is that ""Ven Devorame Otra Vez"" was their huge claim-to-fame song; which helped them as a springboard for future successes.Hail Azucar moreno!!!!!!!!"
2,Good series...terrible format,"The series content is very good, however the company that produced the DVD did a terrible job of formating the episodes/scenes. They split a one-hour show across two DVD's to save using a fourth disk in the series. In doing this, the scene access for the second half of an episode will not play; it jumps to the beginnig of the next episode. The only way to view the 2nd part is to fast-backwards all the way to just after the start of the scene and play from there. If you go all the way back, it takes off at the begining of the next episode. Very Frustrating to deal with the formating faults on this DVD. I will think twice about ordering another DVD from this studio."
2,Beware of Format,"Bramwell is an outstanding series. The rating of 2 stars is for the following reason. To add to AGPym's formatting issue, Shanachie has also issued 7 episodes and labeled the dvd as season 1. According to the PBS web site I printed out with the Bramwell retrospective, listing all seasons and episodes, this dvd combines seasons 1 and 2 (which originally totalled 8 episodes)and leaves off the final episode of season 2. This missing episode involves a subway (underground) train crash which I did originally see when the series was new. Also check my customer review for the so-called season 4."
5,Bramwell - a view of Victorian London,Brilliant series which illustrates the prejudices of Victorian England against educated women. Also graphically shows medical practices of the time and the attitude to the poor. Combining this with excellent acting and costuming make this a series worthy of recommendation.
4,"Bramwell, season 1","Great series, with both well-acted drama and keen insight into medical practices and life in this period of British history. Our only disappointment was that the episodes are randomly split among the dvd's, requiring that you change the dvd in the middle of some episodes. And the final episode of the series was corrupted half-way through, so we never got to see the end of it. I don't know if this was just the one we got, or if the recording of others is also damaged. But the dramas themselves are great, though a bit bloody in places - those with weak stomachs, be warned!"
1,Bramwell - The Complete First Season,"I know that I will love the DVDs because I have the VHS edition of this show. However, I am not happy with the company who is suppposed to have sent them. I was supposed to have received them late in October or early in November and I still do not have them. It is November 30 today. When I look at my order it shows that they were sent but we have not received them. Kitty Brilliant"
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"Excellent instruction and practice pages, but without answers it is totally useless. This book should be sold to schools only, or should at least indicate that it is intended to be used in the classroom. I see that others have made similar comments. I just wish they had commented earlier so I could have saved my money. For anyone considering this book...DON'T...especially if you are planning to do self-study."
2,No Answers,"As others have stated this book contains no answers, so the exercises really don't help much. I contacted the publisher to find out how I could obtain the answers. I was told this is strictly a student text and that an instructer's manual was needed to gain the answers. Great...NO Why? because only an educational institution can order the instruction manual. I think it would be nice if Amazon included that in their description."
1,Used This Book Distance College Course,"AH! This book was SO frustrating! Took this class distance and had a terrible time! I am very self motivated and have taken distance classes before, usually no problem working through a book--but this one was so vague in areas that it made doing the exercises impossible. No answer key to check your work, and if you get an instructor like mine (who didn't seem to have the time to teach anything indepth) it will make using the book worthless. This book only left me with a very basic understanding and looking to a future in coding, I transferred to another college that uses different resources."
1,Don't bother with this one...,"I purchased this book thinking that it would be a good self-study tool, but it is basically worthless for studying on your own. Unless you need it for a class, skip this one..."
2,MASTERING CODING,"Excellent instruction and practice pages, but without answers it is totally useless. This book should be sold to schools only, or should at least indicate that it is intended to be used in the classroom. I see that others have made similar comments. I just wish they had commented earlier so I could have saved my money. For anyone considering this book...DON'T...especially if you are planning to do self-study."
2,Like sex with someone you don't love anymore.,"It must be difficult to write a book this complicated,with so many characters and so many plots and make it feel as though the writer is just going through the motions. Crumley has always come close to going over the top with his characters, this time he has. Too bad. Crumley can both write and put a good story together but he did not do it here. Everything does not have to be to the nth degree to make it of interest.Pure coke,for instance. Right. Can't have Milo doing pretty good coke.The most beautiful woman he has ever seen is a con artist hooker waiting for her heart of gold to be warmed by Milo.Serial killer TWIN brothers in law enforcement with body parts in a secret basement.The BEST computer guy ever.Read Crumley's The Last Good Kiss to see what a letdown this is. This is sort of Carl Hiaasen goes to Austin,without the humor."
3,Hangover,"Crumley's hero Milo can out drink, drug and fornicate others decades younger. A story too long, with too many names and a ""drawing room"" conclusion that ends with a not unexpected disclosure, are still not enough reasons to ignore this very talented writer."
4,"Please Milo, don't mess around in Texas again","James Crumley is the best mystery writer at work today, and at times he even conjures the ghost of the great John D. MacDonald. But Crumley's best writing is wrapped up in his love of Montana, and ""Final COuntry"" is set in Texas. Not to mention all the other disagreeable associations Texas has for us New Yorkers... Milo never seems quite at home there, and it shows. But Crumley doesn't fail to deliver a tight plot, lots of ultraviolence and a raft of double-dealing hotties. Even marooned down south, Crumley's still head and shoulders above the rest."
3,"Good content, poor format","Brazelton's discussions of child development and his parenting tips are spot-on and very well supported by research (and common sense). I really dislike the format of this book, though. It's written as a narrative about 4 children with different temperaments and it makes it difficult to locate imformation and to figure out what's relevent to your own child."
5,touchpoints 3-6,This is such a good resource for me as a pre-school teacher and instructor of college intern and practicum students. The information in this book gives me additional information to share with parents and students in the Human Development and Family Studies Department.
5,Love it!,Between Brazelton & Sears...I have all the child development advice a parent needs. I like the way Brazelton speaks to PARENTS and not child development experts...it's a very easy to read book with LOADS of great info!!! Very practical and yet has a loving approach.
5,They also serve who only stand and wait,"Cheerful and compliant, and they seem to get along well with others of like background."
3,Disappointing,"This is my first Jaid Black book. After reading the reviews on it, I expected much. And was a bit disappointed.The plot is fast, so fast that we do not have time to explore much of the two main characters. I would have liked a bit more of background... even if it would have meant a little less of those steamy scenes...In other words, I regret the fact that the romance part is a bit left aside. Is it not suppose to be a ""roman""tica?"
4,:0),"I really liked the first and third story. But the third story was not expecting that ending, was a bit of a surprise would not have guess and i guess thats why i liked it. Good quick read.****************"
3,"Two new ones, one old one","We get two new stories and an old one. The first has been published before, but still it is the best of the three.The second one: The Hunger:The story of Elizabeth Batory with a new twist. Sad to say that I missed some of the steam and ideas that Black normally uses in her stories. The hero was a bit too tame and the heroine had no special character that I wanted to read about.The third one: Politically Incorrect Stalked:Famous singer gets kidnapped by high school crush. The end is somewhat of a revelation. Here we have the ideas that I love about Jaid Black again.So: get the book for the first story if you haven't gotten it, yet. Otherwise you can really use the money for better works from Black."
3,"Good, but pricey","The sauce was good, but very costly. Whole it is easier to open a can than make sauce from scratch, it is not worth the price. I'll cook my own from now on."
5,This stuff Works!,"I had been purchasing this item at local pharmacies in the 30 pearls box for as much as 15 dollars a box. It really helps keep my digestive system behaving well ;-)At Amazon.com, the price is fantastic, so that is where I now purchase them"
1,No poopies,"Didn't work for me! Maybe there is milk residue in it? I am lactose intolerant and I also have minor bouts with IBS. I have tried another probiotic for IBS and it worked well but I didn't think it was great enough, so I tried these. I guess I was wrong. I ended up throwing them all out because I noticed major constipation mixed with bad pain and more bouts of IBS. I am going back to my trusty IBS probiotics."
3,A Disappointment,"I guess depending on your needs this may work, but personally for me, It did nothing. I took them for 2 weeks to give them a chance, but they did not improve my digestive tract. Maybe for some people, this would be a good product. I think it is one of those things you have to try and see if it works for YOU."
1,Not working for us,"After hours of research the reviews of these seemed to be of the best, unfortunately these do not work as well as we need for gas, back to the research, we've tried Align which did not work well either, and Philips which has worked best so far,"
2,Gluten may be the problem. Ask your dr.,"I have stopped taking Align. I went on a restrictive diet because my doctor told me my blood chemistry was not doing well--specifically my cholesterol was bad. So I stopped eating carbs and lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks, but I also noticed all of my stomach problems went away. I then started looking into online forums to see if anyone had similar experiences and there were several people who noted that they too had felt better after losing carbs from their diet---more specifically bread/gluten. I have removed gluten from my diet and do not have any more problems unless I accidently eat something with gluten in it. Hope this helps, it has changed my life."
2,HP,"Well, I really wanted to leave a 5 star review!!! These pills are very small in size and they are very easy to swallow. Unfortunately, however, my doctor thought this product did not contain enough probiotic. Pearls contains 1 billion lactobacillus, however, my doctor wanted me to have at least 9 billion! So, I cancelled my subscription and instead, I bought the Bevko brand of probiotics (paid $30 for 120 caps, 9 billion in each capsule)."
4,Probiotic Pearls...,"I have only used the Pearls for about a month, but I think I am feeling better overall. I definitely found some regularity and do not have as much stomach discomfort as I experienced prior to this purchase. I take a pill daily and am hopefull that with more time, the effects will be even better. Great purchase!!"
2,Not enough differing strains in this product,"I initially wrote a glowing review for this product but have done more research since. A good probiotic does need to survive the digestive juices, which this one does due to the coating. However it only contains TWO different strains of bacteria and a low dosage at that. Now I know I need to look for as many varying strains as possible to better match the natural gut flora and at least 8 billion per dose.This could explain why I initially began to feel better after taking these for a few months but the benefits then decreased. I was taking them to eliminate constipation which I still haven't managed to do."
5,Excellent Vitamin,Excellent Vitamin!! My Doctor Highly recommend the Acidophilus Pearls. Especially theEnzyamatic Therapy brand they don't have any yeast in them. My Candida level have alwaysbeen very high. Now with my last blood work they went down 1 point. And they will continueto decrease !!! yeah!!
2,Noticed no effect ... unlike standard Lactobacillus Acidophilus Capsules.,"Took the pearls, as directed, and noticed no effect.With standard Lactobacillus Acidophilus Capsules, the results were immediate.Will not be buying this product again."
2,Try something else.,"I took these every day and did not notice any difference. I have recently started taking ""Trubiotics"" and within a week I have noticed a change in my digestion. Whether you try ""Trubiotics"" or not, skip the ""Pearls"" and try something else!"
3,ok align works better,i got these looking for a cheaper replacement for align and align is by far a better product if your looking and pro bios just start with the best align
5,Excellent product,This product has been very beneficial. It has greatly helped my digestive problems and has also boosted my immunity tremendously. Easy to swallow and easy to carry as each one is idividually wrapped and they don't need refrigeration. I highly recommend it.
2,No change,"I was encouraged by all the rave reviews, but after using these for 2 weeks, I have noticed absolutely no difference in any of my symptoms. I appear to have gained a little weight and feel that I am retaining more water than usual. I don't intend to finish the full month."
1,"Ineffective, hate the packaging","Didn't work at all for me, I do much better on the cheapest acidophilus tablet from Trader Joe's. And the foil packaging is awful, my sausage fingers are clumsy in the early morning and the spheres are really small. I can understand why the pills aren't loose in a bottle, because if you spilled them you'd have a skating rink, but I wouldn't buy this again even if it worked."
4,it works,I've been using this item for a week and I personally consider this item really works; I've decided increase consumption to 2 pearls a day (morning / night)in order to expedite terapy process. I've purchased similar prebiotics from others sources but I have not felt same results I've obtained from these pearls. Highly recommended.
2,Still too early to tell if it's doing anything,"I've been taking this about 2 weeks now, hoping it would help with my IBS (C), especially with the gas and bloating which can get pretty unbearable. Honestly, though I have yet to feel any relief so I'm a bit disappointed because of the rave reviews. However, I'm still giving it some time to work. If there's absolutely no real relief in the next month, then I'll just have to cancel my automatic 3-months' renewal, and continue to get the other health benefits from regular yogurt:("
3,NOT good for people with serious IBS,"These may be good for people with MILD issues, but not for those with bad IBS; the kind where you plan your daily activities around the availability of restrooms. ALIGN works much better, although it is quite expensive."
3,warning - trace lactose,"I bought these based on the reviews. I didn't discover the trace lactose until after I had been using them for a few days. My husband thinks they are great. I continued to use them, as my research has suggested that a lack of lactase in the colon might be a part of lactose intolerance. I have even tried taking them at bedtime. Still gassy and bloated. Meh. I really wanted them to work for me. My husband has gotten a good product. I am still on the lookout for a lactose-free, gluten-free product."
2,Its been a week...,And still pretty upset.. I'm hardly ever normal when going to the bathroom.. Most of the time I'm either constipated or have diarreah as soon as I eat something that upsets my stomach. I've been constipated all week and somewhat gassy. I dont know if I should give myself more time to adjust or try something else.
1,doesn't work at all,"This pearls didn't do a thing to my digestion problems, I could take as well tick tac so I'm not sure from where these all positive reviews, maybe from the seller??? had to return to 3lac which so far is the only one that works."
3,Does not work- update it does somewhat if you use more,"After my gall bladder surgery I searched for a product to be more regular and reading all the great reviews I thought I would give it a try. Sadly it did not work for me, only bloating, discomfort and gas.Yet at the price I guess you could give it a try, the pills are very very easy to swallow, they are tiny like little pearls.i wanted to write an update, as I gave this product another shot, and I started taking about 4 of them a day, well this seemed to have helped some, but i am unsure if it is safe to use that many.Like i stated it sadly does overall not work for me, but giving the many positive reviews from others I will end up rating it 3 stars, as for the price it is worth at least a try I believe. Maybe you get lucky"
3,didn't really notice a change but can't hurt right?,"I guess I just have a seriously wonky digestive tract. I notice that SOMETIMES after taking them bowel movements are a bit easier to pass; however, this is a really inconsistent outcome. I wouldn't count on it to change your life in any meaningful way (unfortunately for IBS-C sufferers).Not bad but certainly not a huge impact on remedying my bathroom woes."
5,Much better than regular acidophilus,I have been taking acidophilis for years with minimal help with my digestive tract. Then I found these that don't get clobbered in the stomach and actually get delivered to where they belong. I have had much better results with this brand.
1,I'm sure it works wonders . . . just not for me,"I honestly don't believe I have a sensitive stomach (I usually don't eat exotic foods, but I can stomach the average meal without any issues). I wanted to believe in using this pill because quite frankly I don't eat much yogurt to get the healthy bacteria, but after about 2 weeks of using this pill my stomach started hurting & cramping. Once I discontinued use everything was back to normal in about a week/week and a half. Like I said, I'm sure it works wonders for quite a few folks but there is something in this pill that severely upsets my stomach."
5,Perfect!,"Friendly bacteria or probiotics are very important to good health.This brand is very easy to take and delivers what it promises.The pils are very tiny and so easy to swallow.Start the new year off right with a commitment to good health which includes daily probiotics, your body will thank you. I will purchase this item again."
3,SusieG,"Been using for a couple of weeks now - haven't noticed any difference yet, but will continue to take daily and see what happens."
2,mmmmm,Didn't really notice any change. I would keep looking for some other way to help.... There's got to be another way.
5,Good for your body,"I've been taking these for 2 weeks now and have only noticed minor improvements in achieving ""regularity"". I'm pretty skeptical about how these can actually provide relief from constipation, fiber supplements would be better for that. However what I did notice after taking these pearls for a few weeks is a reduction in breakouts on my face. When I went to get a haircut a few days ago my hair stylist actually commented on how smooth my forehead was and how much fewer pimples I had. I told her it was because of ""less stress"" since I was too embarassed to mention these pearls. The probiotics contained within these tiny pearls are definitely doing something good for my body, and are very convenient because you don't have to refridgerate them."
5,My first use of probiotics was to counteract the effects of a course of antibiotics.........,"My first used of probiotics was to counteract the effects of antibiotics and discovered it has made me more regular. So, I continue to use probiotics and found it helped with my heartburn and eventually took myself off of my prescribed heartburn medication which I had been on for years. With my continued use of probiotics, I could now consume milk products without the aid of lactase tablets which I also used for years.I am enjoying life more now that I am on the Pearls. The results that I have achieved to date has been me taking Pearls twice a day for over a year. Pearls helped me be more regular, able to enjoy milk products, and be free of heartburn.Pearls worked for me and I am very happy with the results achieved.My best wishes for good health to ALL!!!"
5,For colon health,This product is recommended by my colo-rectal surgeon. I am a colon cancer survivor and find these `pearls' to be excellent for maintaining my digestive health.
1,misleading labeling,I wish the producent put on the labelthat it contains milk residues.I suffer from Systemic Candida andcan't tolerate the smallest amountsof milk.
3,Not as good for IBS,"I thought this product would work just as well as the more expensive ALIGN recommended by my doctor for my IBS-D. Unfortunately, it is not as effective and I will have to go back to the more expensive ALIGN. I'll finish off the Pearls and will update this review if anything changes but I've been taking it for several weeks now with no improvement in my condition."
5,Works,I always have my doubts about non FDA tested products but since I started taking pearls my digestive problems have vanished. I'm kind of shocked. I had tried drinking all kinds of fancy whole foods kefir's and greek yogurts. I'm glad I found this stuff.
4,Very convenient for a probiotic!,Love the tiny little pearl that you only have to take once a day... Hurray! Have only been on it for a month but so far so good. Will try to update after more time has passed. Also love that I can use the auto-subscribe with Amazon... so easy!
5,best probiotic,"These are great probiotics and do great at keeping a regular digestive system, acid reflux, bloating. I referred these to my brother in law who has ulcerative colitis and he is now off of prescription meds and is strictly taking these with no exacerbations of his condition. You can safely take one twice a day. A holistic MD originally referred me to these and now I have referred them to multiple people. These are better priced through Amazon than through the local grocery stores and health markets."
2,A bit disappointed,"As a candida sufferer i take pro-biotics regularly, i found that this one has little or no effect. The dosage is very low at 1Billion compared to the more effective products at 11-50 billion. I tried 2 boxes for 3 month, taking 2 a day. Very disappointing."
1,"For Me ""Align"" is the Superior Product","I bought someAlignawhile back and it cleared up my IBS issues in a week!I saw this and and read the rave reviews and the price of the ""Pearls"" was much cheaper than theAlign.But taking this product daily (for over 30 days) I would think it would have taken away my symptoms, but no it didn't.For Me ""Align"" is a Superior Product, it is almost TRIPLE the price of ""Pearls"" but worth it!"
2,does not work as expected,"It works marginally. I think it depends on people. Some people may feel this product works fine, but not for me."
2,Doesn't work,"These aren't anywhere near as good as Phillips Colon Health. I thought because they were a couple of dollars more expensive, that they'd be even better, but I should've stuck with what worked. Only good thing with the pearls is that they're super easy to swallow and you can take them any time. But convenience doesn't beat quality."
5,Pearls,"This product was recommended by a good friend. I've taken Acidophilus before but not in this form. I stopped taking it for a few days and noticed a difference and feel that I need it to maintain good a digestive system. It's wonderful,I'm going to place another order."
5,Fantastic,"I have always suffered with bloat and constipation. Two weeks ago, I started taking the pearls. On day one, the pills worked. I am so happy and so relieved, literally relieved. I am getting ready to order three more boxes to make sure I don't run out. These are worth their weight in gold. I have tried others, but nothing can even compare. This is worth buying if you suffer from bloat, gas or constipation."
5,Love Them!!!,"Was having a terrible time with gas, bloating for about a year. My stomach also sounded like a garbage disposal. Went to the doctor and had tests. They never did find out what was wrong with me. A friend of mine recommended these pills and I am so glad she did. I have been taking them for 2 weeks and my problems are gone!!!! Will take them every day for the rest of my life. The price on Amazon is also much cheaper. I bought a 30 day supply at Walmart for $12.50. I just got a 90 day supply for $5.00 more."
5,My Husband LOVES PEARLS,"My husband battled a systemic yeast infection for years. After several 30 day rounds of diflucan, he sort of gave up and just accepted the fact that the yeast wasn't going away. He had such an over abundance of yeast, that he had a ring around his neck, it looked like he had been hung. He also had rashes behind his knees.Out of desperation, I ended up purchasing yeast cleanses for my husband. He was so desperate, he agreed to take them as I prescribed.Garden of Life Fungal Defenseis the first cleanse I had him do. Followed byRenew Life CandiGONE. The rashes cleared up. After looking around on Amazon, I decided I'd have my husband takeEnzymatic Therapy Acidophilus Pearlsdaily. I also have him usingGrandpa's Pine Tar Soap. He's been yeast free for about a year!!!My husband swears by these Pearls and the Pine Tar Soap."
3,Just not for me.,"These probiotics don't seem to be as effective for me as far as bloating. After switching to these instead of the Raw Probiots for Women for a lower cost, I have came to the conculsion that these are not for me. The do not seem to be benefiting me nor hurting me, which is why I gave them 3 stars."
4,Seemed to fix some of the problems,"Bought these thinking it would help my constant diarrhea. Problems seemed to be resolved immediately. Thought this would help regulate the amount of times I went to the bathroom, but this wasn't the case, which is why it got 4 stars. At least I don't have to clean the toilet on a daily basis.After not taking the pills for a few days, my body seemed to be fine without them. I'd recommend taking these as long as you need them, rather than a ""daily"" supplement.This is also the best bang for your buck, 90 pills for $15? GNC wants more than that for 30 pills."
5,Wonderful,"This is the only thing that prevents me from having a daily stomach ache. If you suffer from IBS and cannot process food, Pearls are a small miracle."
4,"Great design, wish it had more kick","This is an easy to swallow little pro-biotic, but after comparing with a few more I kind of wish it had more of bacteria parts per billion. I love the design and I take these everyday. It has helped to decrease my gas issues."
4,BioBeads might be better,"I just read a report by Consumer Labs on probiotics, which included this product. Natrol BioBeads wasn't specifically evaluated, but since BioBeads and Pearls appear to offer the same technology, I compared the contents. According to the manufacturers, Pearls provides two types of bacteria, while BioBeads has four. Consumer Labs indicated that, in general, the broader the variety of flora a product provides, the better. Ironically, Consumer Labs also indicated that the types of bacteria in both products(strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) can usually survive gastric acids and don't need a coating anyway."
3,It's OKAY,"I bought this in hopes to tame some systematic yeast symptoms. I changed my diet to go along with this and I understand the yeast die off symptoms. About an hour after taking the pearls, I became very bloated and uncomfortable. I didn't notice it do much aside from that (Felt no different). I started taking a different brand with a higher CFU count and I noticed such a difference. These pearls only have 1 billion cfu's but the one I started taking in its place had 10 billion CFU... just a little hike in variety of organisms and more of them made the difference I was looking for. For example, the doctor said I had geographic tongue and nothing I tried got rid of it. After taking the probiotic with 10 billion cfu, my tongue is normal again after 3 years. I also don't experience bloating like I did with the pearls."
1,bad reaction,the box came ripped with some of the pills popped out already. I will not be buying from this company again. Also the pills gave me stomach upset
5,"Good, well priced probiotic",This probiotic got pretty high ratings and is cheaper than other products that got similar ratings. I would recommend to trying this probiotic.
4,Relief from bloating.,"It helps calm down my stomach and allows me to have probiotics in my system at times when I do not consume yogurt and etc. Also, the fact that they do not have to be stored in the fridge is a plus."
3,Good information but....,"This book provides some really good information about women who lived in ancient times and does not confine itself to Greek and Roman woman some famous and/or infamous Hebrew ladies are included such as Alexandra and Bernice.However, the plethora of typos detract from the enjoyment of this book."
2,Could have been a great resource,"I was excited to get this book, as I am an avocational student of the ancient world, from the around the start of united Egypt to the fall of the Roman/Byzantine Empire, and of gender studies. But I was very disappointed in it, due to the weaknesses already mentioned above of typos and the exclusion of extremely important women. For instance, how can one write a book about Notable Women of the Ancient Greek and Roman world without an entry on Hypatia, or the Empress Pulcheria? And why did the authors leave out the incredibly brave and women's rights models of the early deaconesses of emerging Christianity?I wish I could recommend this book wholeheartedly, but I cannot. It does contain much that is important for women's studies, but we need another attempt of this wonderful idea, one that gives us a more complete overview."
5,GREAT X-MAS CD,A very nice listenable c d added to the christmas cd's i have already collected up until now! Thanks for this sale
1,BEWARE: VERY MISLEADING AD,"Buyer Beware: This is a very misleading, if not fraudulent offering. The picture leads you to believe that you would receive a collection of colors. When you order, there is no color selection offered, which further confirms that you would receive a collection of colors. IN FACT, I received ONE 50 yd roll of ribbon in a single color----not of my choosing...... since I didn't have a choice during the ordering process. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND DEALING WITH THIS VENDOR."
3,deceptive,"The photo is very deceptive. They show an assortment of colors. They send you the fifty yards as stated, however it is only one color which you do not even get to choose. The color they sent me was this light lime green. I didnt ask for nor can I use 50 yrds of light lime green. They should not be allowed to show a photo of an assortment and never state that it only comes in one color and at the very least allow you to choose the color."
4,"I hate statistics, but this book helped it make sense.","I have been taking a statistics course and was terrible at the concepts being taught. Regression, Anova, single sample, etc. So I bought this book since I am a total dummy when it comes to Stats. The book really does a great job as long as you have windows and excel as you can imagine given the title of the book. :) I do recommend it to anyone struggling as it walks you through step by step of each type of problem and explains in clear english what exactly is going on. I found myself making notes, highlighting and referencing various formulas in it often. Thanks to this book I passed my stats class!"
2,Don't use if you have the newer version of excel!,"Book would be great if they would have used the newer version of excel. The book uses exel 2003, and 2007 big disappointment!"
5,Great for those taking Statistics!,"I ordered this book upon recommendation from the instructor for my Biomedical Statistics class and I can tell you that I would never have made it out of this class with a good grade without it! The book breaks down formula input and brings the statistical language down to ""everyday peoples"" language. Thank you, Dr. Schmuller, for writing this book!"
1,Not worth the time or money.,"This is a pretty worthless collection of common knowledge. The time spent reading this book could just as easily be spent surfing the web. The latter method would not only save you the cash, but likely yield better results."
3,Excellent collectable but not enough pictures,"I was so happy when I got this book as I have been restoring a couple Chris's for the last several years. But was dissapointed after thumbing through it. There a very few pictures of the different models, infact the illustrator seems to have used the same 4 boats throughout the whole text, with slight exception. The history material is excellent dry reading witha lot of facts most people are unaware of. Every model is listed in the book but sometimes so briefly the reference has no value. All Chris Craft owners should have this on their coffee table or aboard their boat."
5,A must for any chris craft enthusiast,Recommended reading for anyone interested in historly of this legenday American boat builder. Chocked full of details about the company and the boats.
2,Limp Like A Noodle,"38 Special make arena rock with a slight southern twinge. It's not exactly the most appealing form of rock, and this particular album is not even a very good one by 38 Special standards. An arena rock album should at least have hooks, then it could be considered a guilty pleasure, there are none here. Fans of the band should stick to ROCK N ROLL STRATEGY or SPECIAL FORCES; casual fans would be better off with a comp. Best tracks are `Rebel To Rebel' and the title track."
5,Great book for anyone from the east dreaming about the West.,"This was my first Eddward Abbey book, but it certainly will not be my last. The book allows the reader to view many parts of ""the West"" from his authentic perspective. From his time in a firetower in Montana to retelling and following John Wesley Powell's story of exploration, Edward Abbey will have you hooked on each subject and adventure that he eperienced on his Journey. I think there is a part in all of us to want to live this type of life, but only a few of us have the courage to follow our heart and dreams the way Abbey did."
4,Michener Magic,A great read about the Middle East and the attempt of Pakistan to move into the modern world. Another look at history through fictional characters and the impact of Europeans on the Middle East.
4,Good music from a very underated band.,"I have to admit some of the songs on this album are too metal sounding for my liking, but there are some excellent songs on here. No album is perfect. I think the best song on the album is the only way( is the wrong way) followed by where do we go from here. I also enjoyed the missing, god damn me and you walk away. I think this band is very under rated. They aren't even playing anything off this album in my area, and I don't understand why. Filter has a sound like no other. Wake up radio stations and play some filter!!!!"
2,Does Filter give up?,"Bought the cd today and listened to it first thing. CD was enhanced too so I watched the video and the overwhelming feeling I had was to open the cd drawer and break the CD in half. Sure I should expect that the type of music I listen to doesn't always have a clean message but I feel this newest cd shows Filter's lyrics and message go darker and reaches for nothing more than a proclamation to give up, it's over. I buy explicit lyrics over clean because I'd rather stay in tune with the real message a band puts out and I'm not sure how the clean CD could really do them anymore justice. I'm deeply disappointed with the road Filter is taking...I bought the 3rd and newest CD because the 2nd was great and I like some yelling in songs and their music but the 3rd puts me in a ""no sale"" mood for future recordings. Buy the single with the remix if you want to hear the Filter you knew a CD back. If your in love with the music then the 3rd will be just as good."
3,"Buy ""Title of Record"" before this one","If you're new to filter, you definitely will like ""Title of Record"" better than this one. This is a little harder and heavier than that one, although Filter in general is not for you if you just heard ""Take a Picture"" on the radio and think the rest of the album is like that ballad. To be fair, this album is just OK, unlike TOR which is excellent. Maybe over time this will grow on me (like TOR did). If you're a Filter fan, you'll listen to it anyway."
4,Excellent Rock Album,"I really enjoyed this album. Filter claimed to be the only pure rock band on the Family Values 99 TOur, and they couldn't be more right. Filter's third album in no way falls behind or really passes the first two...which is good, meaning that this album sticks to the incredible excellence of the first 2. Filter is an excellent band, surviving on a fine line between pop and rap/metal/rock (or whatever the hell you want to call it.) Elements and emotions of ""Short Bus"" and ""Title Of Record"" are found on ""The Amalgamut"", and the new album contains songs that an excellent live band can add to its rockin repertoire. Highlights of ""The Amalgamut"": ""Where Do We Go From Here"", the first single, ""You Walk Away"", ""So I Quit"", and ""It Can Never Be The Same"". An excellent album, and a great addition to any rock collection. Although i'm sure you pop and rap/metal/rock fans can find something you like here too."
2,Buy Title of Record and Short Bus before even thinking about wasting your money on this one,"In attempting to follow 1999's dynamic Title of Record, Filter released an overall much heavier CD, with only ""Goddamn Me"" and ""Where Do We Go From Here"" to save listeners from the nonstop barrage of poorly-played, over-distorted downtuned guitars.All of the songs are tolerable, but it cannot compare to its predecessor. The lyrics take a sharp downhill turn, with self-conscious wording and cliche themes (Marilyn Manson had the right and a reason to comment on Columbine, because he was blamed, and Korn did because of their ties to dark and violent music. But who cares what Richard Patrick thinks?).Patrick once claimed that this would be the best record since the Defones' ""White Pony."" He was wrong."
5,filter king's of the pack,"Filter offer up a stunning and highly anticipated 3rd cd in the amalgamut. It starts off with a bang and keeps you listening till the very end, sure to please any heavy music fan, or any fan of good music period."
1,Complete let down. What were they thinking?!?!,I loved the last album and still listen to it at least once a month. It set the stage for what Filter was all about for me. This new album was like they produced it themselves and didn't ask anyone's opinion if any of it was any good. Two songs are marginal and the rest are B-A-D BAD! I was completely disappointed and let down. I will go back to the old album and hope that the next one is better.
4,Sweet Tracks and Poor Tracks,"About half of this cd is quite good. But many songs bother me or are just very poor. Like the last track especially. It's 8 min are smooth bass pretty much. There is no point to it. The 2nd last track is extremely boring as well. I do not care for the song GD me because of the GD's, and my long walk to jail would be good if it wasn't for some of the lyrics bothering me. Now however:you walk away, american cliche, and where do we go from here are excellent songs. Columbind is quite good, the missing is quite good, the only way is the wrong way is quite good, and so I quit is good. So even though there are quite a few tracks on here that aren't too good, I still think that this is a pretty stinkin good album.So people that like good music, go and pick this puppy up and you won't be disappointed."
5,Veneto in Bocca,"Unusual Book find, I have been collect the In Bocca series for years and this was a new book cover for my collection. Book was in great condition."
2,The dubbed version isn't THAT bad,"I don't have the DVD but I've seen the dubbed and subtitled versions of the show and I don't think they are really that different.They cut out very little other than the occasional ""damn"". Kaiba's suicide threat is sugar-coated and Tea's attacker is a mugger not a perverted gym teacher. The dubbed version dialog is a little more about fate than friendship.I think the music and voices are better in the dubbed version. Pegasus' fey voice in the Japanese version is actually a little annoying.As for the DVD, a scant total of 3 episodes is too few to pay for. Just tape it off Saturday morning TV or find the dubbed first season DVD set somewhere else."
2,Disappointing,"I find it all a bit muddled and indistinct. She does have quite a sweet voice, though, so I'll keep an ear out for future releases."
2,I agree with the girl from Ohio...,"I too, saw her perform with her TRULY talented brother, Rufus and I was thinking the same thing---Somebody PLEASE turn her microphone down!!!--This album is okay because of studio perks. Songwriting is not bad either- the potential for songwriting alone could be better than a lot of Tori Amos. But she is nowhere near the same league as Rufus. Her voice is average."
5,Excellent for drumset players,"This book makes you become a sight reader on the drumset. It's one of the hardest drum books out there. It was voted one of 25 best drum books by Modern Drummer Magazine. The author of this book spent fifty years playing drums for many recording studios before he published it. If you're a drummer at any level, but haven't have the chance to check out this book, try to check it out soon."
3,Decent Info on TA,This book is nothing special. I really disagree with the author's interpretation of the ADX indicator. Absolute level is far more important than slope. The day trading systems shown will lead you to the poor house in no time. Presents some novel ideas though.
4,Good gift.....,Gave this to a friend who collects cameos and she has really enjoyed the book. Books are always great gifts!
1,No thanks,If you are looking for a picture book buy this. Iwas looking for a book to value MY cameos not someone else's pictures
4,"Very thorough and ""user friendly""","The book is very thorough and spotting every important and relevant issue concerning old and newer cameos. Very easy to read and remember, giving all that's good to know about cameos. Recommended for anyone interested in knowing them - collectors, dealers, teachers...The only thing is that almost all of the photographs are in black & white, and in a rather poor quality. If the photos were in good quality color, this would have just made the book perfect. I, for one, would be happy to pay for the difference."
2,Nonstick finish comes off too easily,"I purchased the 14 pc set at Kohls and thought it was great until I noticed the nonstick finish was coming off of two of the saucepans. I had only used them a couple of times. It looked as if I had used metal utensils but I had used plastic. I didn't even cook on high. The skillets were okay when I returned the whole set (plus the larger skillet I purchased seperately), but I was afraid they would start loosing the finish as well."
2,Non-stick surface scratches too easily,"After using this pan for a week, I was already seeing scratches on the non-stick surface. I had only been using wooden utensils with it, so the surface must scratch very easily."
5,If you loved or hated the 80s...,"""Money"" is above all a book of scintillating intelligence. I've never read anything as clever as this, sentence for sentence. I don't mean that it's ""deep"" or ""philosophical"" - though I suppose it is - just that the use of language is astonishing and the wit of the words will keep you entranced through the rather unpleasant adventures of the narrator, John Self (subtle, huh?). It has the best jokes, the best insults, the best made-up names for automobiles, and the best descriptions of alcohol and cigarretes in contemporary fiction. Best line: ""Unless I explicitly tell you otherwise, I am _always_ lighting another cigarette."" Even if you loathe the central character - though how you can fail to love him is beyond me - read it for the prose."
5,Hilarious,"Amis at his best, IMO. Ignore the iffy political implications& settle in for a wild ride w/ a protag. that can't pass updrink, drugs, or women."
3,Light Lunch,"Money was my first book by Martin Amis. I found his writing clever, a bit mannered, vibrant and -- ahem -- full of potential, sometimes too cute, with an undercurrent of finger wagging, and ultimately unfulfilling. Amis has a ear for film dialogue, and Lord knows he can entertain for stretches like Christopher Buckley or another New Yorker wit, but I missed the underpinnings of a story I cared about.A long time ago, at the university I happened to be attending, I took a creative writing course, and one of the best stories that term was written by a cigarette-rolling undergrad who assumed the task of holding the reader's interest, with comedy, in a character without a life. He succeeded, perhaps more so than Amis, whose central character John Self isn't everyman and doesn't represent the 1980's any more than I do, but who sticks around for 363 long pages of self-destruction."
3,I haven't finished the book,"Great style of writing, but somehow the book lost me somewhere in the middle. It is about John Self, newly rich who burns his life and chases more money. Dialogues are funny, some parts of the novel are very entertaining. But unlike ""London Fields"", which arouses more and more interest as the plot develops, ""Money"" becomes repetitive and boring. At least for me."
2,Vanishing,"Martin Amis has a exquist and unique writing stlye. In "" Money"" however, the threading gets lost along the way. It becomes difficult to follow the storyline: storyline which eventually vanishes midway through the book."
1,Money is passé.,"Martin Amis is an excellent writer, but the book is dated. I should have read it years ago when it first came out. The ego of the men in the book is too big a hurdle to jump at this point in my life. I feel somewhat bad in writing this because Amis is a writer I admire. Nevertheless . . . it is what it is."
2,sketch w/o substance,"Like the other reviewers, I share an admiration for Amis' prose, creativity, and wit; unlike many others, however, I thought the book was pure, self-indulgent (no pun intended)..., a work of brilliant creativity, but lacking utterly in substance or thought. Beyond an amusing character sketch, it has no plot, says nothing new, and adds nothing beyond (still another) caricature of 80s materialism. After the first 100 pages, I could have skipped the remaining 250 -- same stuff repackaged, variations on a theme that, however creative, becomes a bore when it hits you that the book is not going anywhere."
5,Impossible to beat,"To paraphrase that great American hero, Tony Soprano, if there are any flies on Martin Amis, they're paying rent - at least with respect to this novel.I can't praise it enough...enconiums (enconia?) like ""best novel of the 80's"" (it is, by the way), ""scathing treatise on the dehumanizing effects of money and fame"" (true too) don't do it justice...It's just aburdly entertaining, start to finish, and Amis makes all of his extremely cogent points through the tragicomic exploits of our hero, John Self...It's like listening to some jazz immortal, like your Coltrane, your Miles, at their peak...Amis is completely in the pocket: every joke hits, every wicked truth makes you wince...he's completely ""in the pocket""...I even agree, I think, for once with that armpit sniffing nerd, GM, though I couldn't tell you what trainspotting, onanistic nonsense he's blathering on about. I'm guessing he actually understands the star system and was trying to convey approval..."
5,Wild Romp in Decadent 80s NYC,"Absolutely, one of the best books I've read. Amis's The Information is a close second. Literate, street smart and oddly sexy -- its a virtual encyclopedia of excess and verbal virtuosity."
4,A book that reflects your lowest experiences.,"""Money"" is a book that reflects your lowest experiences, but it does with the hard to come by knowledge that life is not a simple, by-the-numbers exercise. Amis reconizes that everything -- experience, fun, sex, drugs -- is overrated; what really counts is honest human contact. And that is something that has escaped our present age. A wonderful, life-changing novel. Please read it, now!!! Besides all this, it is howlingly funny, and it skewers the superficial stylishness of our time like nothing yet."
3,Funny,"Martin Amis would be a better writer if he wrote more than one draft. He wings its more than Rushdie. This book is funny, but it is hard to follow, and at the end, it is hard to recall what was read. No real story. No real value."
2,Juvenile.,"Maybe an andolescent boy would find this author and this book in particular worthwhile reading. Even if you aspire to be a drunk and a lout, this tiresome book would still not be inspirational. I enjoyed London Fields by same author, even though I thought he may have lifted the idea from Muriel Sparks' The Driver's Seat; but Money was a complete waste of time. After 100 pages or so, I didn't see the possibility of any further character development or improvement in the writing style. I didn't bother finishing it."
3,"Entertaining, but it goes on too long","The strangest thing about this novel is that it rips off Brian De Palma's awful film 'Dressed to Kill'--a film which Amis himself mocked in an early 80s magazine article. Amis can write a sentence with the very best of them, but can't construct a plot to save his life. Certainly worth reading, however."
2,Drunks don't make interesting protagonists,"For the most part, I believe drunks like John Self in this novel, crazy people like the Australian pianist in the movie who's name I can't remember, and blow-hards like Citizen Kane don't make interesting protagonists.It takes a Dickens to create works of art based on characters whose mental life seems so circumscribed and repetitive."
2,repetitive and shallow,"It is seldom that I leave a book without having finished it. It seemed to me to be extremely repetitive. John Self is (ha ha) an egotist advertisement-director Britishman who travels to the US to negotiate his first major film. An alcoholic and drug-addict, Self lives obssesed with a woman who cheats on him on a permanent basis. He gets drunk so many times it stops being funny. Amis can write and has a good sense of humor, but the story goes nowhere. Maybe other books by him are better."
3,Amusing but lacking substance,"There is amusement aplenty in Money--lots of deft touches that bring a chuckle as the story zips along. Unfortunately, the novel suffers from a lack of substance. The points Amis makes about greed and unbridled lifestyles are fairly obvious, the targets of his venom are too easy, and the superficiality of his characters is overblown. I nonetheless found the novel worth reading for its comedy which, when it works, works very well. I would give Money 3 1/2 stars if that option were available."
4,Mertons contemplative creed,"This essay was written in may 1965. Trappist monk, prolific writer, poet and social activist Thomas Merton lives the greatest part of his day in his hermitage. He describes how a day of his life looks like, but also what he experiences. It is a sort of contemplative creed. The style is lyrical, the content profound. The meaning of silence, the dialogue of the biblical message with the modern world,the correlation between solitude and community, these are some of the themes in this little book, that is beautifully illustrated with photographs that Merton made."
2,Size is a little on the small side,The pampers size is a little on the small side. This size 1-2 is even smaller than size 1 of other brands.
5,The softest for my infant,We love this brand. It is so soft. The only thing I would comment is that the size 1-2 doesn't help me to figure out what is the minimum weight I can use for my baby. It has the maximum weight but no mention of the minimum weight.
5,Rookie Dad Loves the Swaddlers,"I'm a 1st time dad and was pleased to see our hospital (huge, big-city hospital that delivers 4000 babies a year) using Pampers Swaddlers for newborns. I had never changed a diaper so I had the nurse give me detailed instructions. She said the swaddlers are the best of breed - especially for newborns.Knock on wood, but we have yet to have an infamous Blow-Out, and we have had lots of full diapers. No leaks either.Now if Amazon would just figure out how to keep these in stock...."
2,Have to disagree.,"This may be a ""classic"" text of whittling, but having been written in 1930 makes this difficult to follow, and sparsely (and poorly) illustrated. Better seen as a piece of history than a guide to undertsanding whittling. Avoid."
5,Black-and-white illustrations and diagrams round out this time-tested primer.,"First published in 1930, The Art of Whittling is a classic introduction to the hobby of woodcrafting through whittling. Linden Publishing offers an unabridged edition of the original guide, offering over a dozen woodworking projects including continuous wooden chains, working wooden scissors and pliers, balls in cages, entwined hearts, fans, and even ships inside bottles. Black-and-white illustrations and diagrams round out this time-tested primer."
3,disapointed,"i thought this would have more pictures of things to make, it is for christmas gifts so really havent used it yet ."
3,so so,Author tried to do too much- it is an excellent overview of woodworking from different cultures. It would have been more valuable to me if the author had broken it down into a book about each culture.
2,I asked my gecko to sit still and let me put on the leash...,"After two people were able to convince her to wear it the bauble on the back to hold it closed kept tipping her over (yes, I did buy the extra small for a leopard gecko... even though geckos are supposed to use the small). She was able to slip her legs out very easily and it was over all a waste of money. A ribbon around her waist would have worked better."
2,Beasties for Dummies,"I really looked forward to reading this book, figuring that someone with as much access as Alan Light would give me more of an insiders look into a great band. But he remains on the outside like the rest of us, instead relying on first hand accounts of the band members themselves as well as many others in or around hip-hop. At first it's kind of cool to get some of the early stories about the punk scene in NYC, which really branched out from the hardcore D.C. bands like Bad Brains. You just never really get to be in the studio, or at the writing sessions, or on the tour bus. It's more fitting for liner notes. Let's tackle this subject head on and get some good stories in a collection. These guys are legends, and have toured and recorded with and around some of the core players in hip-hop history. I found this book to be a shallow take on a complex and genre bending crew. Disappointing."
2,Not worth the money,"I brought this for my son as his room is all Nascar. The comforter is cheap and not at all warm, the sheets are scratchy (fabric conditioner helps a little) and the pillow cover is way to big for a little guy. My son is 20 months and has had this for about 3 months in his racing car bed. I am very careful when taking of the fitted sheet and putting it on as other reviews have said it rips easily.Unfortunately there is no other Nascar sets that I have found to take it's place, so I'll have to keep it and be careful. Am looking into making my own - Walmart has better quality Nascar fabric."
2,Not Impressed,"I am very disappointed with the quality of this bedding. The fitted sheet ripped on 2 sides within a week of use, the comforter is scratchy. I wouldnt recommend this bedding, I am returning it and getting something else."
5,Ideal for the smallest of race Fans,"I just received the bedding and I absolutely love it. I think that the quality of the bedding is great. I have the same set, in the twin, for my older son and he loves it. The sheets are fine and the blanket is just right."
5,good bargain,I ordered this bedding almost 2 years ago from another company and i had to pay 10 dollars more! my little boy is now 3 and 1/2 and he LOVES his bedding. you can't go wrong with this one! also it washes and dries really well. no special treatment needed.
3,Keep your crib sheets handy,I wasn't real impressed by this bedding set. The fitted sheet ripped at the corners after only a month. The quality crib sheets I already owned are softer even if they don't match.
4,GYB Products STOPPER BRAKE LED-BLK/RED,"Four years ago I put one of these on my new bike and it has work great. It requires a few little modifications to mount it, but it is worth it. When I apply the brakes it is bright and really gets the attention of the person behind me. That is just what I want, to be seen on my bike. In most motorcycle/car accidents the person in the car almost always will say ""I never saw him"". With this system on your bike, at least you will be seen from behind.By the way I bought another to add to the older one.Jeff"
2,More pretty than functional,"This is a pretty glass hummer feeder. However, it is not easy to snap the base on and off, and the paint is already coming off after having been outside during a few rainstorms."
2,Inexpensive and cheap,"While serving the purpose for which it was purchased, the ratchet on the swivel is not as sturdy as the original I bought this to replace. Probably would not buy again - as the title says inexpensive but cheaply built."
4,good product,I used mine for months w/no problem......til I dropped it.The problem w/plastic?It breaks.The leather holster would have been fine after a drop.But that was my fault not the makers.
1,"Well made & holds secure, but you need 2 hands to use it!","The phone snaps in & holds very well. But since the phone is so thin & the release tab is fairly strong, I can't get the phone off with one hand unless I struggle with it. That's no good for me and I'm not using it. Not worth returning so it's is a desk drawer."
3,goes well with landscaping color,"You can buy these at Costco- 4 for 49, but only about half of them have worked- they blend well with the bark, look like quality solor lights but for the price i expected better quality.I love them if they would work right."
4,A master book on sales,"Whether, you are selling timeshare, vacation ownership, sell vacuums or other B-C or B-B products, One on One is a mustread. Although some of the selling solutions sound like open doors to be kicked in, most info is very valuable.I highly recommend this book."
5,Engaging and Erudite,"A biting polemic against Christianity couched in the form of a biography of the last ""Pagan"" Emperor of Rome, the short-lived Julian 'the Apostate', this book does not fail to satisfy. It is packed with drama and moving characters, and above all pathos for the doomed but impassioned Julian himself. It is told through his own 'memoirs', as well as commentaries on these by two of Julian's teachers--a Stoic philosopher in Athens and a fellow Mithras-worshipper in Antioch. Must-read for fans of Late Antiquity."
4,Remarkable,"Gore Vidal manages to get inside the head of Julianus, Priscus and Libanius with such realism that we feel that we're reading a real diary...it's great. There are some little (forgivable)mistakes, but the facts are accurate and written imaginatively. Obviously, vidal read some material about Rome and the way ""pagans"" thought or the rivalries between several cristhian factions. I don't give a 5 because vidal should have studied a little more about roman warfare on the 4th century."
1,Help! I want to enjoy this book (still reading),"A few pages in, while reading a fictitious letter dated March 380, there is a reference to the Council of Chalcedon, which occurred 70 years later. Is this the way the book is going to be throughout?"
1,This booked sucked,I didn't like this book at all. I had to write a paper in my college civ class over the comparison of this book to the actual Roman's real lives. I couldn't even get through more than one chapter at a time without losing interest. The ony reason that I looked it up on the web was to see if I could find something that might motivate me to read it.
4,What might have been,"I approached ""Julian"" as a fan of Gore Vidal's essays and letters and as someone who often wonders how Western culture might have developed differently had it not been for the rise of monotheism in the form of Christianity. Vidal takes us back to one of the pivotal moments in late Roman history when the transition from religious pluralism and tolerance to state-sponsored monotheism was not yet complete. Vidal managed to make compelling and dramatic what might, in other hands, have been a dry and unsatisfying history lesson. I finished the book not only with the sense of loss I expected, but also with a more nuanced understanding of the issues at stake at that moment, again pivotal, in Western history."
5,Julian; We hardly Knew Ye,"From the earliest pages, Vidal serves up a novel which makes the value and tragedy of history all the more poignant. And it is more history then fiction. Much of Vidal's book is based directly on the philosophical writings of Libanius as well as the extant writings of Julian himself. The social and political life of the Fourth Century Roman Empire comes alive in this wonderful book. Vidal does for this century what Robert Graves did for the First Century in ""I Claudius"". To say that ""Julian"" is a Classic is no pun. Julian as an historical figure has stood out far more than many of his contemporaries who ruled much longer. His attempt to alter the course of history he is both remembered and reviled though not often completely understood. Vidal in his inimitable way, has cut through the rememberance and revulsion to paint a wholly human portrait of this continually fascinating figure."
1,Cable only worked for 2 weeks.,"I ordered this cable to hook up my LG 1080p LCD TV up to the digital cable. Cable worked fine for a couple of weeks and then just stopped working. There was no damage done to the cable. I hooked up another cable and it worked fine, confirming the problem was with the cable, not the TV or box. Not worth the money to ship back so now I'm out $15 and have a useless cable. Thanks."
4,Great Cable For the Price,The cables were just as advertised. You get little loss at 15ft but very little. Shipping was very quick.
4,Not bad at all,"needed this cable for my second HDTV which only have 1 already used component input. I also have the $60 HDMI cable bought from Best Buy sometimes ago. Honestly, they didn't make alot of different to me."
5,Works,This just works.Should say inexpensive when compared to others and does the job.Glad I made this choice
4,Quality HDMI Cable,"I ordered this item to use with my Infocus X2 projector and found out that I needed a different cable, one that is an exclusive cable to the Infocus X2 projector. However, I plan on buying another TV in the near future that will be perfect for this cable's type of hook-up. This cable appears to be well made and durable and will make quick connections to my next portable TV and HDMI DVD or satellite box connections. I'm keeping it because I can see needing it for future hook-ups."
3,"Be careful! OK product, poor customer service......","I hope this product works well should you buy it. It worked OK for me, but I tried to return it, as I received a better wire from a friend. I gave up trying to return it, as all I could get was store credit.Beware!JBS"
5,perfect,The one I got is actually gold plated and works great. It's sturdy and feels well constructed.
4,So convenient and completely satisfied,"I was impressed with the convenience of the experience, finding what I needed in the home and also the speed in which it arrived to my doorstep. I am very satisfied with the quality of the cable I received."
4,Works Fine,Works fine. I think that fittings are not gold plated but so what.Cable is less flexible than the more expensive one that I replaced and doesn't lay as well but who cares.Picture and sound are fine
5,Perfect for long HDMI runs,Cable is very well made. I am using this to connect a Windows Vista Media Center PC directly to my plasma in my media room. The setup works great. I used to use my Xbox 360 to stream media from my PC--which also works flawlessly--but I wanted to avoid having to turn on the Xbox just to play recorded media on my TV.
3,Why spend thirty when you could spend ten?,"Granted that it's better to spend thirty dollars for a cable rather than a hundred, but why spend thirty when you can get it for about ten--including shipping?! Afraid the cheaper cable is no good? They're all made in China anyway, you know. I bought one here on Amazon, and it looks exactly like all the others and works great. Just search for: ""HDMI 2M (6 Feet) Super High Resolution Cable"" Sturdy, good quality cables for under ten bucks. You just gotta love Amazon!!"
5,Great Cable,"This cable has functioned flawlessly for me. Runs from my computer in my office to the big screen TV in the living. No issues at all, picture and sound are great."
1,Bad Cable,We returned this item due to the heads popping off easily. The return was easy and we received our money back.
3,HDMI cable review.,"Good high quality HDMI cable. It would have gotten five stars, but this cable is so big that #1 I could not mount it with any readily available cable staples and #2 more importantly the connector on this cable IS NOT what is shown in the picture and was in fact so tall (or is it wide?) that it would not plug into my TV LUCKILY this was not too big of an issue because I just happened to have an HDMI cable extender that allowed me to use this cable. I would have had to return this cable if it wasnt for that.TL;DR version: If you're routing this cable in a tight space or plugging this into something with slim connector dimensions perhaps check something else out as this sucker is HUGE."
1,Poor customer service,"Product was purchased during construction and stored months before use. When testing the wires, two of these HDMI cables did not conduct a signal. Subsequently, I contacted the seller and no responce. I eventually had to purchase some cables elsewhere. Now I have two 50ft cables that I paid for, and have no use. Eventually they will be landfill."
5,maravilloso,"no se porque venden cables tan caros cuando estos son maravillosos y mas su precio yo lo tengo concetado a un 10080p vizio 47""y al directv digital cable box y es fantastico.la verdad lo recomiendo y los hdmi tambien porque pagar 100 dolares,50 si estos hacen la misma labor"
1,Didn't work ...,"I ordered this cable to hook up a PS3 to a HDTV and it didn't work. I tried to use this cable to hook up a HD-DVR to a HDTV and it didn't work. I took this cable to my friend's house and tried to hook up a PS3 and HD-DVR to his HDTV, and same results. I got a HDMI-HDMI cable from Monoprice and the cable worked right out of the box."
2,Poor Construction,I received cable plugged it it and had to UN plugged it to relocate cable. When I UN plugged it the end of the cable came off. Not worth the cost to return it.
5,Great Value,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered these cables. This time they were for my son's surround sound set up in his room (spoiled brat :-). They work exactly as advertised at a fraction of the price that you can purchase similar cables from Best Buy, Radio Shack etc."
3,Not exactly what I ordered.,Got it in a timely manner but it wasnt 15ft like was stated on the outside of the package or what I ordered. Opened it up and it was a 10ft cable. I still used it and it works like it should but wasnt too happy about the length and false packaging. Wont order from them again.
1,SUPER BAD FILM,"WOW! What a bad movie. The movie opens with a bar tender taking a girl to a house where she is killed and eaten raw. We then go to the credits and three people show up at the same house wanting to hunt for ghosts...which they find. The cannibals are ghouls, trapped inside the house. If you enjoyed low budget 80's super VHS horror films, this one will make you feel at home.Sex, Nudity (Carol Rose Carver, Vida Ghaffari?)"
3,A little on the thin side.....,"I found these blankets to be a little on the thin side, but if you are looking for a set of wrap blankets that can be used for anything, then these will suit you just fine."
2,Really disappointed,"I am really disappointed with these blankets--I have liked every other Carter's brand item that I have. I received two sets of them at my baby shower and six months after my daughter has been born, I have found them to be a waste. They are EXTREMELY thin and very small. To give you an idea, even all of our hooded towels are larger and thicker than these blankets. I love the fabric patterns and they are soft, but as far as warmth, durability, and fabric thickness go, they are not that great. Perhaps I will appreciate the thin fabric more in the warmer months of the year and I am hoping that as my little girl grows into a toddler she will enjoy them as play blankets."
1,Do not buy this product! It is junk!,Product was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.I am very capable when it comes to working on firearms. I was trying to gently thread this sight into my shotgun barrel and it stripped very easily.The metal they use in this product is very soft. In my opinion this product is junk! Do not waste your money or time with this product. I also bought sights from TruGlo. The TruGlo sights are made out of high quality material and went on perfectly. If you are going to buy these type of sights stay away from HiViz and buy Truglo. You will be happy you did.
1,consider this,i bought this sight for my remington 870 and i had to have a gun smith install it since Remington bead sights are press fitted then i took my shotgun for 5 tests 100 rounds each time. the sight placement makes my shots way to high and i end up putting my cheek way low on the stock in order to get a accurate level shot. if you are wanting this sight for a Remington 870 just consider my mistakes before purchase
5,awesome,"perfect fit for my Mossberg 590. he great thing is, it will probably fit any shotgun because it comes with multiple screw sizes for multiple models"
1,good looking junk,the small parts were terrible to work with and would not thread into the sight hole. I ended up just throwing it out
3,It's small,I gave the HiViz Fiber Optic sight and okay rating because it was a lot smaller than I thought it was and it was somewhat difficult to set up and use. I wound up purchasing another sight.
4,This is a movie the whole family can (should) see together!,"A couple of years ago my older son during his 1st year a college saw this movie and encouraged all of us to watch it on his brake. So Mom, Dad, and brother 13 saw it together. This movie remains very popular in our family today. The struggles of Peter and his friends to stand against the Nazi way of thinking is something we can all relate to and should think about in our lifes today. I bought the movie then and gave it to my older son who took it to school. Now, I would like to be able to have one at home. I wish they would re-release it for purchase. I have recommended this movie to alot of my friends and my kids have done the same. The dancing is good and the moral issues are important. If you have not seem this movie, you should."
5,A group of friends dealing with adolecence durring the war.,My favorite movie. Excelent swing dance footage. Wonderful message. Great learning tool. A must see.
5,"IT MAKES YOU LAUGH, CRY, AND DANCE!!","I absolutely love this movie! It is my all time favorite! no other movie made me cry so much. especially at the end, but for those who havent seen it yet, i wont spoil it for you. this movie made me have a special interest in swing and you will find that it shows great accuracy of the music during that time. i recommend it to anyone and everyone!"
5,From a true swing kid,"I L-O-V-E LOVE this movie. No, it's not the best movie in the world, but it's my fave. So is swing music (check out the soundtrack!) I'm trying to join the swing dance club at the public high school, that's how much I love swing. Try this movie out, you'll cry, but it's great!ps I'm really 15, but i have a 12-year-old mentality"
3,Good Story; a little uneven,"Well produced film that certainly evokes the era with excellent dance sequences; but the effect of the Nazi party on the primary characters is a too heavy handed, and sometimes borders on absurdity. Leonard and Bale do a commendable job; but Barbara Hershey's character is too one dimensional. Excellent debut performance by David Tom as Leonard's younger brother."
1,DVD not Region Compatible,"BAD DEAL!!Have written multiple times to seller, no response back, no return address , I am stuck with a DVD region 6 ( USA is region 1) My DVD doesn't read it,can't return to get a refund.Will never buy again from them"
4,Swing Kids,"I have used this film in a high school Ethics class for years and it is extremely well-received by 16-17 year olds. It portrays the different ethical attitudes towards Jews, people of color, the disabled, and people who would question authority, which existed within Hitler's youth group and within much of society during World War II. The film accentuates the importance of critical thinking as well as doing what is right whatever the cost. Swing Kids promotes a valuable lesson for life. It touches the soul, the conscience, and the human capacity to make a diffence through valiant acts of courage. Teenagers were moved by the power of this film and so was I! A ""must see!"""
4,Understanding History,"I played this video for my three classes of 20th Century History and they all loved it. Perhaps it was because they were all the same age as the main characters, but this video really helped my students make a connection to the horror of the Nazi years and understand it emotionally. Great movie for teaching history which kids usually find boring and not in their time reference."
5,Swing Dancer who loved the dancing and music,"Being a competitive dancer in swing snd ballroom/latin, I found this to be a very interesting movie. I could watch it over and over again if anything, for the dance sequences and the music. If you can get this video, do it. If not, get the music soundtrack, which is excellent. I have the CD and the music is great, the swing music, that is. Jumping at the Woodside, Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, Sing Sing Sing are all superb! And the dancing in this video is first rate. Plus it is a really sad story, but I like the movie mainly for the dancing and the music. So, that is my opinion."
2,Who knew the Holocaust was such a Hootenanny?,"The music is great and the actors try very hard to bring some credibility to this bouncy take on Nazi atrocities, but it's ""based on actual events"" stretched beyond recognition. Distinctly American actors, dialect and vernacular do nothing to enhance this schmaltzy soap opera full of stereotypes.The soundtrack, however, is a great collectible."
2,Almost.... but all too corny in the end.,"This movie had a chance to be great. It took a subject of great importance and potential interest and threw in enough cornball lines (especially the goofy and uncomfortable ending ""Swing Heil! "") to put off anyone with half a brain.Robert Sean Leonard and Frank Whaley are good as usual, especially Whaley, but the dialogue is just too cheesy for any actor to pull off. Kenneth Branagh, who did well to keep his name off of the credits of this one, is also excellent as the official who lures Leonard into the Hitler Youth. This movie is also a good chance for people to see pre-ER Noah Wylie do a decent job with an odd role.All told, this movie was not nearly as good as it could have been. With better dialogue and more action, it really could have been a very good movie. Unfortunately, though, it gets lost in stupid lines/song quotes at the most inopportune times. See it, but don't get your hopes up too high."
1,Swing Kids,"Swing KidsI really think that in the product description of movies you need to put a rating, and why it has the rating. This movie was well-acted, but the content was objectionable. This is not a family film. The foul language was not necessary. It was serious subject matter."
2,"A very silly, preposterous film","Even though the dance numbers may be well choreographed and the time period is pretty realistically recreated, the idea of young people in 1940s Germany using swing music as a way to protest the politics of the time just seemed a little too far out and silly to me. Some of the dialogue here is just ridiculous (as are a lot of the set-ups of this movie). Even though it is well-intended and the messages here are clear, it just feels very odd and even unpleasant at times."
2,What are these people thinking????,Ok - I just had to write this review because there were so many rave reviews of this film. COME ON PEOPLE!!!! A movie about kids swing dancing to defeat the Nazis????? Even that one sentence sounds bad. Yes Kenneth Branaugh and Christian Bale are two of my favorite actors but they both need to be embarassed by this horrible film.This is ludicrous. What is hilarios about AMAZON.com is that you can put in any bad movie and see people who LOVE it. Just put in HOWARD THE DUCK as an example.Some of these people should not even watch movies!
4,Gripping Moving Account,I have always been fascinated with the swing/holocaust era and Swing Kids combined the two in an amazing story with amazing actors and screen play. Christian Bale and Robert Sean Leonard are a dynamic team and I hope they do movies together in the future
3,absorbing move spoiled by ridiculous ending,"As others have said, this is a very well acted absorbing tale that hits on a new angle of rebellion in Nazi Germany. It's also fun to watch Christian Bale, Noah Wiley, and Robert Sean Leonard as relative youngsters and definitely holding their own. The story and the emotional payoff is ruined though [PARTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD] - each of the friends' stories come to predictable ends, but in the end Peter's decision makes no sense at all - rather than stay on to continue the fight, inspire more rebellion, and protect his family."
2,Swing Kids,"It's a great movie, but very disappointed when the ""CD"" kept skipping. I bought it new. Not sure why that happened."
4,Robert Sean Leonard is really good,"It's sort of a shame that Robert Sean Leonard will mostly be remembered as Hugh Laurie's sidekick on 'House,' because he's really a fine actor. The other movie I love him in isMuch Ado About Nothing, but I REALLY love him in this. Which is also a bit of a shame, too, because I'm a giant Christian Bale fan. Christian Bale is a jerk in this, though. (But he does get to fistfight with Noah Wylie - a pretty cool scene.) You should watch it for Robert Sean Leonard's noble-yet-realistic performance, his cool period outfits and his surprisingly hip dance moves.P.S. If you're surprised to learn that not all of the young people who served as part of the Hitler Youth were necessarily evil people, and this part of history interests you, you should definitely readThe Book Thief, a 5-star book that will not disappoint you. Head's up: it made me cry -in a good way - more than any book sinceCharlotte's Web."
3,"True story, phoney drama","Swing Kids isn't as bad as its reputation implies by a long shot, but it's too riddled with compromise to really work. The Nazis' vicious repression of jazz and swing music is a great story crying out to be told, but Disney really wasn't the studio to tell it. Hints of a better film abound and it does edge into some dark corners, but the need for an upbeat ending to a downbeat story does the film few favors, and nor does the fact that the period jive and dancing tend to sound and look very silly indeed far too often - certainly Robert Sean Leonard's angst-ridden solo dance of rebellion at the end is an unintentional comic highlight."
5,Swing!,"Swing Kids is an incredible movie. The acting is very well done and the story line and plot has a very interesting twist. But what makes this movie great is the swingin'. Honey, it doesn't get much better than this. With all the music and swingers, it's so hard not to get up and dance! Swing hiel!"
1,Broken,Both the watch and the clock where not functional when we received them. We did not pay too much for this product so did not bother returning it.
1,look elsewhere for better training methods,"The trainer in this training video uses negative-reinforcement techniques and physical manipulation consisting of aggressive alpha-rolling via limb twisting (to teach not to jump), digging your finger into a puppy's tongue (to teach it not to bite), forcing the puppy's hips down with hand (to teach it to sit), pulling front paws forward (to teach down), along with leash jerks (to teach come).There are much better and more effective ways to communicate with and train a puppy compassionately by using positive-reinforcement techniques. Please be kind, gentle, and positive with your puppy and avoid using this video to train your puppy."
1,This trainer could get somebody hurt,"This trainer is using what he calls an ""alpha wolf rollover"" on a puppy who was simply jumping up on him out of excitement. It's a pretty lousy trainer who doesn't know how or chooses not to train a dog on a problem as simple as jumping up by using a lazy and misunderstood technique like that. How about ignoring the dog if they jump up and then reward him when he doesn't? Any dog very quickly learns not to jump up by using this simple technique, or simply teach the dog to sit instead as recommended by the phenomenal trainer Dr. Ian Dunbar (his website is called Dog Star Daily). And it's a heck of a lot safer for everybody involved. You use one of these ""alpha rollovers"" on a dog who's remotely aggressive or simply not your dog, and you could very quickly end up being bitten."
4,The first modern classic album from Kerry! A+,"Before ""Cuenta Conmigo and Cara De Nino"", Jerry gave the world a full preview of what was to come! From beginning to end, this album is pure pleasure. Classics like ""Nada Sin Ti and Dime Tu"" can still be heard booming from car stereos and apartments all over the Latin community! ""Tal Vez"" is my favorite cut from this album. The song was beautiful sung and written. It is a desperate cry for a second chance from a man who's lost his true love!"
2,Poor Hitch Design,"Company claimed hitch would fit a 2007 Hyundai Sonata GLS. Well I had problems installing it because it didn't fit over the rear tow loop and at the same time bolt up to the frame. Since I didn't have time to send it back and go through the hassle of ordering a different brand, I decided to modify the hitch so that it would fit over the tow loop. After finally getting it to bolt on, the twin tail pipes would rattle against the frame rail arms of the hitch because they were so close. I would not buy any Curt products again. I do not trust their quality control."
2,Really poor design -- installed on 2009 Hyundai Sonata,"I spent way too long trying to make this hitch fit my 2009 Hyundai Sonata. When I first lifted the hitch into place, the space between the mounting brackets and the weld-nuts on the frame rail was about 1/2"" - 1"". I tried using the supplied bolts but could not get them threaded because they were too short to make the gap. I went to the hardware store and got longer bolts. That helped, but I still had to first thread the passenger side and then use a jack to tweak the driver side into position. I should've paid the extra few bucks for the Hidden Hitch. The design looks a lot better and only uses a single bolt on the bracket so you do not need to move the muffler."
3,Curt Receiver Hitch,Instructions did not include Hyundai Sonata SE which has a v-6 engine. I had to remove the drivers side muffler to install the hitch. Also the included ball mount is a very loose fit to the hitch.
4,"""the silky chocolate voice""","julia ""what a VOICE"" this beautiful lady has a silky voice that is so smooth,its just awesome.believe me!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Looks Great,I love the look of this comforter and got the matching sheets to go with it for my sons room. I haven't washed it yet but I did wash the sheets and they are kind if hard.
3,"Nice leash, but...........","It is a nice leash, but our bearded dragon, Francine,doesn't like it. She really likes her freedom."
5,Delicious as Viennese whipped cream,"An adorable slice-of-Austrian-life - even if you don't know anything about music, or specifically operetta, you have to enjoy the rich cast of eccentric characters with which the author populates a small Austrian town enlivened by a struggling opera company."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Karl, Andrea, Ahira, Lou and Walter are stuck in the fantasy game world. It is a little bit different now as they are used to it, so this becomes more of a standard fantasy adventure type novel.They become good guys, and fight to oppose a bunch of wizards and slavers."
5,"Very sensitively written, awesome book.","The author approaches the subject with incredible sensitivity without ""baby bashing"" and acknowledging that there is grief and loss involved. She goes into different situations where women decide not to have children, touching on commonly perceived stereotypes of childless women and debunking them, such as the idea that childless women do not have a nuturing side, that they are cold and bitter. This is an incredible book that I would recommend to anyone wavering on the motherhood question."
2,Getting Dated,"This was probably an ok book in 1996, but I really feel that it has lost relevance, many more couples these days are choosing not to have children, and I think the issues are different. I would like to see an updated book that talked about what the choice is like now. Some of the issues are still the same ... who do you leave your stuff to when you die, but that was not an issue I thought was well covered in the first place.The women Jeanne Safer seemed to interview for this book were also heavily weighted towards the arts/entertainment industry. There were a lot of comments like ""I couldn't have children because it would have drained my creativity."" There were few/no comments by average 9-5ers like me."
5,One of the better books on voluntary childlessness.,This is as good a book as I have seen on the psychological aspects of voluntary childlessness. Ms. Safer digs deep into her own and her subjects' pasts and personalities to explore what factors might lead a woman to choose not to have children
5,Very good,"This book had stories from all different women at all different stages in life. It discussed their passions and reasons for not having children. It gave a lot of insight into the psychological aspects of the a decision to be childfree and despite her having a phd, she explains things in a way that makes it a very easy and sensible read. Her analyzation of dreams is a little different, but intriguing..."
2,Not very helpful.,"As a single person, I was disappointed that all the cases presented in this book were married women."
3,Better books out there but a great read eitherway,"I purchased this used, and the seller did describe the book's condition very well. There were some notes from the previous reader which I didnt mind. Actually pretty neat to read someone's insights. The content was good but sometimes the form of writing can be hard to follow. Lots of good examples and sometimes can be redundant. A great read for those who at the beginning of a cross road."
4,An outstanding book for hungry Christians,"I became familiar with this book back in the late 70's. This book has much to say to Christians who want to be actively and accurately involve in their Church and their faith. Love, Acceptance and Forgiveness lives up to its sub-title very well: Equipping the church to be truly Christian in a non-Christian world."
5,Make it easy on yourself,"I purchased KC Daylighters some years ago but could not find the wiring harness and ordered this set to wire up to my boat for a planned 3 day hunting trip in the waters of Southeast Alaska and this harness makes it so easy to hook up, simple straight forward, all wires labeled. Took me about 40 minutes to wire 2 sets of Daylighter packages to my boat and watch them light up the night. Perfect for the job."
4,A Short Summary,"This is a good introduction book to the ""Egyptian Book of the Dead"". The book is somewhat like a commentary to the original text, and is a good source for those not aquatinted with the original. However the book does not cover the original text in great detail, and therefore falls a little short."
2,World War II Movies: The Collector's Series,"A good price but there IS a hidden price - the quality of the audio is very poor, at least in ""The Way Ahead/Immortal Battalion"". Which is really a shame as this was the movie I bought the series for! In all fairness, there is a disclaimer at the beginning of the DVD in regards to quality - too bad we weren't aware of this before purchasing!"
3,World War II propaganda films,"It was fascinating seeing the first of these - ""One of our Aircraftt is Missing"", in the company of a sixteen year old grandson, who definitely found it a bit boring in parts, and I was verry struck by the exemplary behaviour of the participants - ideal not real - As an essay in nostalgia, very well made, I enjoyed it, as did my son, who is a film maker anyway; he was interested in techniques and conditioned,as a child, to such films. Spitfire, I knew better as ""The First of the Few"" - a far more sensible title, anyway, and it has the same well-made interest and a real story, sentimentally told. ""We dive at Dawn"" is well acted and has the same archival interest, while appealing to older viewers or film buffs. Quite moving."
1,World War II Movies,"Unfortunately this had a very poor sound track and you could not hear the words because they were all blurred. This occured on all four movies, so we were very disappointed, as this DVD was purchased because we particularly wanted to see these movies."
3,Too bad about the sound...,"Great period British WW2 films, with very decent video quality for their age but a strain to listen to. It's not always easy for the American ear to follow British accents and idioms, and the worn sound tracks would've done well with some rejuvenation."
3,corelle coordinates callaway gravy boat,What? Me complain that something is not made in the United States? Surely you jest!
4,"Great product, could use better instructions","The hitch from Curt is very high quality - nice welds, thick powder coat finish, and lined up great with the vehicle. I am very glad I read one of the previous reviews that stated removing the rear bumper cover is absolutely necessary because it is! Unfortunately, that step is not mentioned in the instructions, which are otherwise complete. Having thorough instructions would have garnered this product 5 stars."
3,Check with SimpleTech before you buy.,"I bought a SimpleTech 256MB RAM from Amazon.com and installed it into my Pentium III 550 MHz computer but my computer could only detect the RAM as 128MB, not 256MB. I sent e-mail to SimpleTech and a representative told me to contact Tech Support by telephone. After several attempts in several days and long waiting, I finally talked to a technician. He checked the model of my mother board and he said I can order another RAM, then he gave me the model number of the suitable RAM. The price is higher on the other model. But both models are 168 pin PC100 256MB SDRAM. So if you want to buy a RAM to upgrade, I suggest you to check with Simple Tech. The information from the mother board manual is not enough to make a decision.I believe Simple Tech produces good memory module but it may not compatible to your computer. So please check with Simple Tech first."
1,14 days and counting,"I placed an order over 14 days ago, sent several email asking where the product is and I havent received answers on either, I wish I had never placed this order, plus I paid for faster delivery, if I were you I would go elsewhere, without hesitation"
2,Èntertaining but not always accurate,"Caulfield's history is a good read and good fun, but has its odd moments - for instance he weirdly typifies the funny, dreamy, sweet-natured poet Thomas MacDonagh as ""arrogant"", which would have surprised those who fought by his side and were taught by him. Not the definitive history, but very entertaining."
3,Well written narrative history of the 1916 uprising in Éire,"Although well written, Max Caufied's work suffers from a minute-by-minute focus on the military aspect of the Rebellion. There is an abundance of information in the manner of identifying a rebel who runs down Grangegorman Upper at7 PM, telling what sort of weapon he carried and how many rounds of ammunition he had, and what he reportedly yells to the man next to him as they round a corner. After a while, this reader found himself skipping over the numbing details and looking,in vain, for a broader view of the participants and the historical event they initiated."
5,Student Bible,"I purchased this book because i had to give away my bible and wanted similar bible. It is very easy to read, it gives example to current and relevant subjects which makes reading it easy and relevant to day-to-day matters. It also has many facts which ties events of biblical time to today. This is a compact version which makes it easy to travel. It also makes a good gift for young readers who could find the many different current events and persons (not just biblical persons, but also many movers and shakers of the 20th century) of interest in THIS version of the Bible. I highly recommend the NIV Student Bible!"
5,"A wonderful, ""readable"" version of the Bible","Hi, I received this Bible as a gift on my baptism. I had tryed to read other versions of the Bible and was lost half way through genisis. This version is wonderful. Reads like a book, easy to understand (I didn't once see the word ""begot""). For the first time in my life I find I am looking forward to having time to sit and read the Bible. with this book studying thr scriptures is not a chore, but an enjpyable activity. The reveiwer on here complaining that Jesus didn't come in until half way through, must not have realized she was reading a Bible! This has a complete old and new testaments. with great ""Guided Tours"" of the Bible that take you throught the scriptures at a great pace and in an order that helps you to better understand the events and people who shaped Christianity. I would recommend this to anyone looking to read and Understand the word of God, and as a gift for occasions such as Baptism, and Holy Communion."
3,"Like the NIV version, teaching part disapointing",I became a Christian a year ago. I purchased this teaching bible about 8 months ago. I really like the NIV version but I dislike the commentaries and the teaching portion of this bible. One of the things that lead to my conversion was studying prophecy. The commentaries on the book of Revelation and other sections that deal with prophecy seem to discount the idea that this refers to future events. In other areas I found the teaching section to be less helpful than I hoped. The kindle version could be easier to navigate (simpler table of contents). I intend to buy another teaching bible but I want to look at the comments on controversial prophecies to see how this is handled before purchasing another version.
1,Not What I Expected,"When I received this book, it was already USED, even though I clearly bought it new. There was writing all over it, and somebody named ""Gracie Lane"" already wrote her name down in the front page. This also isn't really relevant, since it has the exact same content, but the cover wasn't even the same one as the one featured. I am still really angry at how we got a used bible. Not only that, it took them about three weeks to ship..."
3,"Not my favorite Bible, but it's all right","It's an o.k. Bible. Good price, but I'd rather pay a little more and get a better one. I didn't like the study plan and found it rather dull. Instead I use it for when I'm just wanting to browse through the Bible, but I don't use it for heavy duty reading."
5,looks better in person,"This ring is beautiful, fits true to size, and durable. I've owned this one for over a year and wear it often, it goes with everything and get alot of compliments. I would recommend!"
4,The discovery,"This book has been a discovery. Gidmark, indeed, made me discover the passion of birchbark canoe building. He also made me discover the great canoe builders who live in my own country! This book helped me to build on my own my first birchbark canoe. The review of different builders, craftmen and the numerous photos helped me to understand, step by step, all the building process.For all future birchbark canoe builders, this is the basic book to buy!"
5,Got Blues?,"These guys are the real deal! Energetic, sexy cuts. Great instrumentation and fabulous vocals. Never heard of them? You will soon. Get it!"
5,Wash Day is good,"We all love this detergent and love All PERSIL products. Yes, they are expensive but you don't need much of it to do it's job. The clothes smell so fresh and so does the laundry room. The clothes come out super clean."
2,Persil via BetterProductsOnline,"I ordered 2 green Persils for whites and 1 blue Persil for colors via Amazon because I trust the Amazon site and I never did find time to travel an hour to the only local store that carries Persil, and now I was out. My order was shipped promptly, but I received 2 blues and 1 green. I emailed Better Products customer service and was eventually told to call & arrange for a return of the 2nd blue and then correction by sending me the ordered 2nd green. (I had asked them to just ship me a 2nd green and be done with it. Repacking and exchange on the shipper's mistake is not the headache you need from simple on-line ordering.) Also, I am not 100% convinced this is an authentic product and at this point will not use Better Products online again."
5,One of the first serious research on Persian music,"It seems Ella Zonis book is one of the first ""serious"" researches on the music of Persia (Iran).She came to the country and learned to play Persian instruments under the supervision of various masters. Beside theoretical information about Persian music and also musical life in 20th century Persia, the book gives many interesting information about the social situation in the country. It's so surprising that why the publisher did not reprint that anymore. Anyway it's available almost in all main libraries of the world."
3,Review or religious sermon?,"I bought and read this book and was quite taken aback that although the author did bring out some very interesting insights and reviews about Peter Jackson and the adaptation of Tolkien's works, too many references to Christ and religious revelations supposedly ""hidden"" in LOTR made it sound more like an Evangelist sermon. I didn't need an editorial how Gandalf's fall at Khazad-dum and later return represented Jesus rising from the grave or Aragorn ushering in the Messianic era, or Sauron representing the anti-Christ.Perhaps the book should have been titled ""Peter Jackson in Christian Religious Perspective."""
4,A Very Pleasant Expat American Memoir,"Wharton is very good at creating a nostalgic mood for any American who is infatuated with (and occasionally infuriated by) the French. Wharton describes the trials of buying, restoring and living aboard a houseboat. Though he finds hassles around nearly every corner, he manages to keep his head above water and provides a light-hearted narration.Wharton lives for years in France, but clearly retains a very American spirit through it all, which helps make this story accessible.A pleasant, quick read for any American who finds himself missing Europe's quirks. If you are prone to buying and fixing old boats, cars, airplanes or houses, then you will find even more here."
3,Yo Ho Ho,"William Wharton, American expatriate in France, author and artist, determines to live in a houseboat on the Seine. It promptly sinks. The book recounts the refloating, repositioning and refurbishing of this old tub. Somehow, he does it with the help of friends and a very bright, very practical teenaged friend. As I can barely find my way around a hardware store--and care less--I didn't appreciate the cleverness of the rehab, but I did enjoy the people and the stories abounding in the countryside. Wharton, of course, succeeds. He may be a moderately annoying expat, but he writes an interesting book."
4,Self-Made Shipbuilder's Memoir,Not much of a novel (and awarded as non-fiction) this book recounts William Wharton's adventures which started when he decided to move out of Paris to a boat moored on the Seine. The dream of living on the river is very quickly over while real life intervenes. The boat sinks and it takes some two hundred pages of hard work to get it back on the surface and make it a livable place for the Whartons.Perfect gift to anyone who is into DIY
4,Scientific biography but not quite science,"I found this book well written enough to read through its 616 pages of text. It offers interesting biographical sketches of a great number of scientists and gives the reader some idea of the historical processes of science's advance. However, as the actual science described becomes increasingly sophisticated, Gribbin's powers of exposition fail him. It is simply inexplicable that someone would write such a long history, covering the rise of modern physics, chemistry, genetics, etc. WITHOUT INCLUDING HARDLY A SINGLE EXPLANATORY DIAGRAM OR ILLUSTRATION!!! Unless you come to the book already armed with a strong background in science, you will probably find yourself excusing yourself from really understanding much of what is being talked about in the last 250 pages of the book."
3,Not so Comprehensive as the title suggests,"A good book hat gives historical narrative accounts of the many scientists in history. I do not like about it the fact that it overlooks or give slight attention to some important areas of science like Mathematics. Also it totally overlooks the contribution of the Arab and that of other peoples of the orient.So its title is somewhat exaggerated, it focuses more on natural sciences developed and evolved in the western parts of the world."
2,good but...,"it's a good book, but dives into more details than I expected about the personal lives of those scintists.........a shorter account would have been more helpful"
4,Superb!,"I bought this book for my partner as a present and by the time we both had read through it, I wanted it back. It presents an ""organic,"" reasonable program for wholistic health and eating. The author presents a fantastic amount of detail on fasting and cleansing techniques and the book is chocked with good recipes and thought-provoking information. The most lamentable feature of the book is that the photographs of food either didn't print very well on the book's colored paper or they were underexposed, which might be hard to swallow given that the author is an award-winning photographer. I would highly recommend this book!"
5,Excellent and informative book,This was an enjoyable and easy. As a beginner It was very important to have care instructions. Thank you for the opportunity to express my gratitude for this material.
2,Not worth it.,"I bought this product to give me some relief from feet aches from standing at a tall desk, but it does very little for that. I think most people would get more benefit from a cheap drugstore shoe insert.The product looks and feels quite cheap. It seems to just be extruded 'PVC sponge', and the two ends on the sides seem to be mechanically cut, not ""4 sides beveled and sealed"". If you stand on it for more than a minute, you can see indentations where your shoes/feet were, and they take quite a while to disappear. I think standing on mousepads would give you more relief.I will be continuing to shop for a better solution."
3,not thick enough. spend money elsewhere,its not bad but its just not comparable to the other kitchen matt which we bought at twice the price. Its at least twice as good. save your money and look elsewhere if you want padding for kitched or work area.
4,Good deal - industrial look...,"The product arrived quickly and is definitely a comfort to stand on. I put it by the kitchen sink, and I actually look forward to stepping on it. However, it is black and as such looks a bit industrial for a home kitchen. But considering the cost of the ""designer"" comparables, I am quite pleased with it."
5,My mom and wife loved it,"I bought a few of these floor mats for my mom and wife. They are contantly in the kitchen washing dishes and cooking, so I figure I add a little comfort to their feet while they do it. They both loved it."
4,Well worth the price,"This mat was not very expensive, but it does the job. My knees and back do not hurt so much any more at the end of my shift."
2,beautiful but not safe,"There is no doubt this is a gorgeous blanket and if you have the lennon collection in your nursery, you should get this blanket! But use it as a decorative piece only, to hang on the wall or over your glider. I would not put this alone in the crib with the baby. I bought this blanket and found that the shag yarn edges of the blanket pull off quite easily posing a choke hazard for the little one. I found my 12 month old one day with a piece in her mouth since loves to suck on her blankie. The plush throw makes an excellent crib blankie!"
4,MANY COMPLIMENTS !!!,"I am finding that ""PRODUCT REVIEWS"" can help immensely when deciding on a product or when ""on the fence"" about a particular item for purchase.I wear cologne quite often AND the scents I DO wear, receive compliments on a very regular basis! Xeryus Rouge is definitely one I highly recommend! It's a bit strong (so no need to bathe in it) and is better suited for night wear, special events etc... (Not an everyday cologne).I didn't give it a FULL 5 stars because I reserve a perfect score for the absolute BEST of the BEST. Xeryus Rouge is certainly not far from it though! If I were able to, I would have given this cologne 4.5 stars!JJ-"
5,FOR REAL MEN OVER 40,"THIS PRODUCT MAKES YOU WEAK AT THE KNEE'S, NOT SPORTY , NOT LIGHT, NOR TIMID. IT IS < FORMAL YET INTENSE > IT IS NOT FOR THE SHY OR AVERAGE MAN. IT IS QUITE STRONG WITH PASSION, WITH CHAMPAGNE AND MUSIC. VERY MACHO, WOODSY,AND QUITE SEXY. DON'T STAND TOO CLOSE TO ANY OTHER MEN. "" YOU WILL BE THE STAR "" PERFECT FOR THE BEDROOM "" AND LOVEMAKING. ENJOY"
4,Return of the Hooded Man,This DVD completed the three series I had. It's a fun series and not to be taken very seriously. Good fun. I loved the return of the former sheriff's body to it's grave -- Very enjoyable DVD.
5,Music and History,"While this album is not for everyone, Marty fans will appreciate it. Marty sounds great and, of course, the instrumental work is first rate (as always). It is the history of the American Indian (particulary the Sioux Nation) set to music with a little social commentary thrown in. Marty fans know of his love for the American Indian and his concern for their future and the sad living conditions they now find themselves in."
5,Badlands cd,"This was a birthday gift for my husband who is Shawnee/Anishnabe and has a strong connection to his Lakota brothers. He was quite moved by the words and music of Marty Stuart, an accomplished musician. His treatment of the sensitive nature of both historical and current treatment of Native Americans is exemplary. It is obvious that he has empathy and understanding for the First Americans."
3,Badlands,I love songs and stories of Indian people....and I love Marty Stuart. He does a good job telling the stories and singing the songs.
4,Learning Mechanical Watch Repair?,"My review is for the 1949 edition of the book. The information is very good for the person just getting started in the repair of mechanical watches. It covers the tools & procedures for watch cleaning & repair in 1949. It has a troubleshooting section which is very informative. Something books of this age did not normally include. It would have rated 5 of 5 if it also covered adjustments. There was nothing on the adjustment posistions or temerature.The book is a good read for anyone wanting to know more about the repair of mechanical watches. It is recomended for those who have a curiosity about, thinking of starting, journyman or professional watch repair."
2,May I suggest Another Book?,"I used this book for Japanese 1 and had to retake Japanese 1 in San Diego because I wasn't up to par with the Japanese 2 students. Key in the ISBN #0-8248-0881-9, Learn Japanese: New College Text Volume II; of couse the Volume I is also avaliable. I used both volumes and plan to goto the third. NTC's book was OK to satisfy the foriegn language requirement, but I wouldn't use it if I were planning on speaking Japanese or planning on taking Japanese at another school, my instructor was native Japanese and disliked it more than I. The price is totally unacceptable! Learn Japanese: New College Text is $12 at Amazon.Com, and I speak Japanese with confidence; where as NTC's Basic Japanese is $53, and I was being corrected, and ultimately had to retake Japanese 1 because of the lack of Kanji, vocabulary, and sentence structure knowledge. This is 100% my opion, and not Amazon.com's."
1,NTC's Basic Japanese,"I've never personally used this book, but I have reviewed it in a class focused on teaching Japanese as a foreign language. This book is probably one of the worst I've seen. Much of the Japanese used in this book sounds odd to non-foreign Japanese speakers and is often inaccurate and some examples are just plain wrong. For example the book translates ""Warui tenki desu ne"" as ""It's warm today."" when it really means ""The weather is bad, don't you think?"" Many of the lessons are not organized well, and absolutely no explanation is given on grammar patterns covered within the book; instead of letting students figure out how to use grammar patterns within other sentences by explaining how they work the book seems to focus on just teaching raw phrases."
3,save the money,"I gave this product 3 stars because it does its job, but isn't necessary. When you first get the bottles and pacifiers, boil them. After that (my pediatrician agrees) just pop them in the dishwasher. Save the extra step. This, the bottle warmer and wipe warmer were a waste of money. I will defidently smarten up for the next one. Save your time and money."
1,Skip it!,"We thought it would be a great time saver. Turns out most of the products we were going to use in it (i.e. Medela bottles and pump accessories, feeding bottles and nipples, etc.) specifically say, ""Do not place in a microwave steamer"". Save your money and use a 3 or 4qt pan you already have and boil the items for 5 to 20 minutes."
2,Just not worth it.,"I have to admit, being a first time mom, I wanted the BEST for my baby. I wanted the bottles, the pump and pacifers to be sterile. I found the same problem with the condensation. It was more of a hassle than a help. When my lactation specialist informed me it wasn't neccesary to sterilize everything after each use, I didn't see the point... Hot soapy water works just fine. Save your money for something you will need; like diapers!"
5,Great Product,This item is so easy to use and works great. I use it daily with ease and am able to have sterilized bottles and pumps at any moment I need.
5,I am soooo glad I registered for this!,"The express steam sterilizer is really the easiest and most efficient way to go if you want to be assured that your baby's bottles are truly clean. When I first started using bottles I would use the sterilizer between dishwasher uses. But after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher, the ounce markings on the bottles started to fade away, and the plastic caps to cover the nipples started to change color. From then on I've used the sterilizer exclusively. It is quick, easy and effective. I have taken several extended trips with the baby, and it is so easy to travel with and store her clean bottles in. This is one of those products that may not be necessary to have, but I am so glad that I do!"
5,Not a throw away gimmick,I have bought too much baby stuff trying to make life easy. I can tell you from experience that this gadget works and is a vast improvement from the one that goes on a stove. Buy it.
1,Bulky,"Too bulky, I ended up returning it. I love the Avent bottles but found this to be useless. I sanitized my bottles in the dishwasher instead with sani rinse cycle."
5,This is a life saviour,This was recommended to me by a friend and is absolutely a necessity even if you have an access to dishwasher. Once you have washed the bottles its just 2 mins and you are done. The bottles comes out clean and sterilized! This is a MUST product to buy..
4,No dishwasher needed!,"This was the perfect solution for my pump parts and bottles. I read everywhere that you do not need to buy a sterilizer if you have a dishwasher, but I don't run my dishwasher fast enough to have my parts and bottles ready for each feeding/pump. This fits all of my pump parts and 2-3 bottles and nipples. It's ready in 4 minutes, which is way faster than dealing with the dishwasher. You do need to prewash in soapy water, but I don't worry about scrubbing. Overall, it does the job in a very short amount of time!"
1,Very disappointed!,"I bought this product thinking it would be a very good purchase with the bottles included, but I soon came to realise that the avent bottles leak b/c the top doesn't seal properly. This happens with all 4 bottles and is very disappointing since I thought Avent was a good product recommended by mother's worldwide. The sterilizer has been the best part of this purchase as it definitely comes in handy when you don't have a full load in the dishwasher and you want a clean bottle in a matter of minutes. I wouldn't recommend the bottle especially with being a first time mom - it just adds to the stress and lets face it, who needs more stress with a newborn!!"
2,Perhaps the most useless gift I recieved,This is probably the most useless baby item I have ever recieved. It takes a quite a bit of room in my cabinets and I have never once used it. I don't know- It seems that hot soapy water works just fine to wash my baby's bottles. Don't waste your money or your cabinet space. There are at least 1000 other items I would recommend before this one.
1,A waste of money,"I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!<br /><br />If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.<br /><br />BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!"
1,Useless,"If you've dropped the bottle and nipple in toxic waste, this might be more helpful than washing in hot water with antibacterial soap or a dishwasher. Otherwise, I think washing the bottles is better."
5,I LOVE this sterilizer...makes life with newborn easier!,"I am the mother of a 7 week old little boy, I didn't give a thought to having a steralizer since I am breastfeeding. I always knew that I would have to return to work and eventually introduce a bottle. I bought the Avent Isis breastpump and it was such a hassle to boil it every day. I saw this product on the Avent website and knew that I had to have it. I pop the pump into the rack...add 7oz of water and throw the whole thing into the microwave...nothing could be easier. Another great product from a great company."
5,Timesaver,"This product is so easy and efficient when sterilizing anything from bottle nipples, pacifiers, breast pump accessories and bottles. Beats boiling all these items!"
2,not necessary - the company does not get packaging right,"First of all, this product is unnecessary. but, if you order it like I did, just know that it will not come with the 2 9 oz. bottles and getting the bottles is a hassle because Amazon is the primary. I had to reorder several times and ship it back to Amazon many many times because bottles were ALWAYS missing. Amazon FINALLY sent me two bottles separately..very very annoying"
5,Can't imagine being without it,"We purchased this before the baby was born, just in case we had to go the formula route. We did have to go that route, and believe me, just get this, there is no way you are going to take care of the many many things you have to do for your little baby and manage to sterilize everything the old fashioned way. Simple, no brainer purchase."
5,Still good after all these years,"I used this Avent sterilizer for my third child, who's now three. Then I used it for my fourth, who is now 14 months. And I still use it. It's extremely easy to use and I simply feel more comfortable knowing that her bottles are sterile. Sure, you can use the dishwasher as other reviewers have noted, but who wants to wait until the dw is full to run it? It takes four minutes. Why not err on the side of purity when the opportunity is there? After all, there will always be a host of other bacteria-laden items that your baby will want to taste."
3,Convenient but lots of condensation,"I use a lot of the Avent products and bought the sterilizer to ease the pain of having to boil all my bottles. It doesn't take that long to sterilize...just 5 minutes in the microwave. That's the great part about it. Washing them takes 5 minutes, sterilizing takes 5 minutes and there you go---4 bottles ready!The only thing I didn't like about it was the condensation like the other reviews noted. There is nothing you can do about the condensation. The drying rack takes forever too so we just wipe them clean with a freshly laundered burp cloth.I rate this product 3 stars for its convenience and problem areas."
4,A Must-Have for Bottles & Binkies,"I would put this on a must-have list for new parents. I gave the sterilizer 4 instead of 5 stars because of the price. $30 seems a lot to pay for essentially a plastic bowl with a lid. But I suppose I've gotten my money's worth, because I still use it several times a day to sanitize breast pump parts, bottles, nipples, and pacifiers. I'm not a germaphobe, but I get peace of mind knowing that the nipples and pacifiers I'm putting into my infant's mouth have been sanitized. It's especially good for pacifiers, which are always getting dropped on the floor - you don't have to wait until you run your dishwasher, you can always pop the sterilizer in the microwave on a moment's notice. Just be careful and make sure the items you plan to sanitize can withstand the heat - for example, some pacifier cases are meant to be sanitized but others will melt in the steam."
5,Great product - especially for the price!,"I have used the Avent ""II"" sterilizer found at other retailers. (probably not much difference between the two) I have been using the sterilizer for one month since having my twins. It has really been helpful cleaning non-Avent items (breast pump items, baby bottles, pacifiers, etc.) It can sterilize in 2 minutes (depending on the power of your microwave). You don't HAVE to have this sterilizer, but, it helps if you want to clean a few items without having to boil water each time or running your dishwasher.It came with two small Avent bottles. I'm not reviewing the bottles themselves - that's another topic. However, this is a nice feature so you can try these bottles out to determine if you want to use their bottles or not."
5,Great !,"Very easy to use (I even use it to sterilize my yogurt jars for the yogurt machine !), and quick (3min in all) : it's a great product !"
5,Very convenient,I use this at least twice a day to sterilize my avent pump and storage bottles. It is fast and easy and I can't imagine going back to boiling bottles again. A must have for working moms.
5,Great Product,This is such a great sterilizer. It's easy to use and fast. I do four bottles at a time plus you can throw in a few Avent pacifiers and thier caps. This is so worth the money.
5,Makes Serilizing a Breeze!,"As we tag team feedings and bottle cleanings, this items has been a god send! It's quick, and so incredibly easy to use. We even use it for pacifiers, nipples, and other bottles. Unfortunately, our little one is rejecting the avent bottles in favor of a different brand. We were lucky enough to find some bottles that would fit in the steamer. Careful to avoid steam burns when removing the lid, I've been caught off guard a few times when I've beena bit too eager, better to let it sit for a while before opening."
5,Gets the job done!,"This product gets the job done. Does what it says. All you have to do is add water and pop it in the microwave for 2 mins. I wish it were a bit smaller, but I suppose its size accommodates large bottles. I put bottles, pacifiers, breast pump parts in it without a problem."
5,Love...Love...Love It!!!!!,"This is one product that I use at least twice everyday. Avent bottles were all that my son would use. At first I did the whole boil the water on the stove bit but soon realized that I had other things to do in life than sterilize bottles! When I pumped, I was able to fit the parts of my Medula pump in the sterilizer and nuk them also! People are shocked when they see how easy it is to sterilize bottles. I have even had people tell me that they don't use Avent bottles because they don't want to sterilize bottles. With this nice little invention, sterilizing is a snap! Plus, it comes with two 9 ounce bottles--a nice little bonus! I have been using this sterilizer for over 5 months twice a day and it still looks the same as it did the day I bought it. Overall, a convenient must-have!!!!!"
5,one of the few MUST BUYS on the planet!,"Don't even think twice about buying this...as Nike says...""Just do it""! The system is easy to use, the bottles are as sterile as a NASA lab (THAT is pretty darn sterile). It is durable as well, mine has lasted through two children (and is on loan to a friend for their newborn) I cannot imagine any other way to handle the bottles. BTW, buy the bottles and nipples, truely the best choice out there!"
5,"Quick, efficient and convenient","This steam sterilizer is one of the greatest gifts I received! You don't have to wait for boiling water or watch the clock, all you do is put in the right amount of water, set your microwave and it's done. This sterilizer enables you to do more than one thing at a time because it can sit closed for up to three hours and still stay sterilized! You can put it in the microwave, hop in the shower do whatever else you need to do and when you're ready, uncover it and use it! This let's you use the sterilized bottles or pump when YOU are ready because you can sterilize up to 3 hours in advance. Very, very highly recommended!!!"
4,Pretty good for the money,"I will admit that I had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way (boiling water in a pot on the stove) so when I saw this product over seven years ago I bought one immediately. I loved that it was so effortless! PAY ATTENTION to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage. No one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so-so when it comes to their child, so read the instructions. I also purchased another when my second daughter was born because I gave my sister the first one. My only issue is that because of its small size (it has to fit in the microwave after all!!!!), you have to really stack the bottles, nipples, etc. in a way that utilizes all of the available space. Once again, the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack. So, if in your sleep deprived, hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache."
2,lid doesn't close,I got this sterilizer because of the Avent name. My main complaint is that the lid doesn't lock into the base when closing. You have to use alot of power for it to close. I have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock.
5,Love this product!,The steam sterilizer is so convenient and easy to use. I can't ever imagine having to boil bottles when there is a product that takes only 4 minutes. There is not enough hours in the day with a newborn in the house and this is one way to save time.
3,"Expensive, troublesome...","Good concept for a steamer, but here is what I've found:1. Lid is very difficult to put on and remove. I've broken a few nails trying to pry the lid off!2. All items must be dried after steaming.3. Only holds a few bottles at a time - a hassle when a newbown eats 10 times daily!4. A dishwaher works just as well (since all bottles and nipples have to be washed before you steam them anyway).Now I wash everything in the diswasher then boil everything once a week. Boiling bottles and nipples takes the same amount of time (around 5 minutes), and once the items are drained, they seem to dry much faster because the hot water evaporates so quickly. Also, maybe it's psychological, but I feel like the bottles/nipples are much cleaner after I boil them!"
4,Not really necessary,"The steam sterilizer is definitely easy and convenient. Just pour 200 mls of water, add your microwaveable bottles, nipples, breast-pump parts, etc...place in the microwave and a few short minutes later, you've got sterile supplies. This is excellent if you don't own a dishwasher, as stated by a previous reviewer. However, if you have access to a dishwasher, this gadget is just a gadget. I find it takes more time and effort to retrieve the sterilizer, set up the bottles, nipples etc... than to just pop it into the dishwasher. (This is especially true when you have you're a first-time mother overwhelmed with a new baby ~TRUST ME on this one.) If you have a healthy full-term baby, it's not really necessary to sterilize items everytime, a run through the hot water cycle in the dishwasher is sufficient. If you don't have a dishwasher, then by all means I recommend it. If you do, skip it. I've only used this once, and since then I've simply used the dishwasher."
5,"Fast, easy, effective, compact, portable...","Three words - just buy it!This is a fabulous product. We bought it the day we started bottle feeding - figured it had to be easier than boiling, and faster than using the dishwasher. We hated the idea of chemically sterilising our baby's things, and we already had the microwave, so this was a no-brainer.It's more compact (and cheaper) than the electric model, so it's easy to take along when travelling away from home.Use it to sterilise more than just bottles/breast pumps - great for dummies and small plastic toys.Just be careful to avoid steam burns when handling the steriliser after it's done - this thing gets HOT."
3,It's Okay,This product is nice if you are just going to use it to do just a few bottles. If you are breast feeding and just using a few bottles. If you use a dishwasher you really don't need it at all. We have well water and no dishwasher so we have to sterlize all our bottles so the only 4 bottles at a time got old quick. If you have a lot of bottles to do I would recommend a steam sterilizer that does 6-8 bottles at a time. It's much more time efficiant.
2,more downside than upside,"I am breastfeeding but offer my baby bottles every now and then. This was pricey - there was another brand that was much less, but this one attracted me because it holds the Avent pump pieces. Well, this just means that there are some slots that the pump clicks into. I have not bothered with that 'feature' since the pump sits in it fine even if you just lay it on the rack (ie the pump will fit in any sterilizer!).My biggest peeve with this is that the bottles and pump are covered with condensation when you take them out - if you leave them on a bottle dryer it takes more than 24 hours to dry them. I rinsed this every time I used it but there are water stains in the bottom still - it really needs to be scrubbed out. It is just making extra work!I am putting this away after using it for two weeks since my Doctor said that it is really not necessary (the dishwasher or hot soapy water are fine, he said). So for me this was an expensive countertop decoration."
2,Works OK...but I didn't need it,"The Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer works OK, but I didn't need it. All that was needed was to boil all of the bottles once before the first use, then wash them with hot soapy water after subsequent uses. The Advent bottles that come with the steamer do not seal well and leak when you shake up the formula. I wish I had not purchased this...it was not needed and now takes up space in my cupboard."
1,Why do people like this???,"I don't understand why people like this product!?! I bought this because I didn't want to boil my bottles anymore. I use both Avent and Dr.Brown bottles and everything seemed to fit just fine.... so what - After 4 minutes I had to rewash everything and then boil it because EVERYTHING I put in the sterilizer came out FULL of condensation and with a VERY VERY strong smell of plastic. The only way to get rid of the smell and the condensation was to re-wash, re-boil. I put the product in the dishwasher several times hoping it would reduce the plastic smell and tried the process again (several times). The results were exactly the same. So basically, whenever you feel like washing bottles, then sterilizing, then washing again, then boiling -then and only then should you use this ... product!"
2,"Unnecessary, but ok","I'm a new Mom, which means I'm boiling everything the baby touches. I'm not knocking Avent. I love the bottles and the breast pump, but this sterilizer is hard to use (only a Ph.D. in engineering could get the bottle parts in the M.C. Escher design outlined in the user's guide.) and it turns out we don't need it. Our pediatrician and lactation consultant assured us that the diswasher gets the bottle parts hot enough to sufficiently sterilize them.Now I only use it for the breast pump parts, which again, is working great for us."
3,"Good, but not necessary","Very easy to use, but don't feel that it is a must have. All baby's need to develop their immune system and therefore I feel a good hot water and soap cleaning does the trick. Have only used the sterilizer once, my baby is now 4 months - hasn't been sick yet."
4,Worth The Money,This was a product that every mother should have it was definitely hard to part with when my daughter got older. It cleans not only avent but dr.Brown bottles too when placed correctly. It's definitely worth the money and its very efficient.
5,"A "" must have"" product.","We have had our steam sterilizer for 4 years now--2 kids and one on the way. We still sterilize our younger child's pacifiers and the inserts to the sippy cups. Don't be fooled into buying just the Avent bottles, unless you prefer them. We used Gerber bottles (which have been around forever and still are the best in my opinion). They fit four bottles at a time, plus nipples and lids."
5,Awesome,This sterlizer is so easy and convenient to use. It takes only 5 mints and your bottles are sterlized. And it does not take up much space. Its one of the best shower gifts you can get anyone!!
5,At 9 mos. I am still using it,"My husband and I love this sterilizer. We have continued to use it even though our son is 9 mos. old. We sterilize lots of stuff in it, including toys."
4,Made the bottles cleaner,"I see other reviewers talk about how sterilization isn't really necessary -- my doctor recommended it once a month, but doing it made the bottle SEEM cleaner to me, even if they really weren't any better than dishwasher-washed.My only beef is that there was so much condensation left in the container after it was done that the bottles were soaking wet. And who wants to dry them off with a germ-infested dish towel?? But other than that, it was super easy, and a great place to store the bottles, too."
1,Wasn't useful at all,"I added this item in my baby registry but was not of any use at all. I didnot know that most manufatures recommend not to microwave or steam sterelize bottles. The same is true with nipples. Latex nipples can't even be boiled. So if your child has difficulty taking the bottle and you try out different brands and different nipples, this does not work.This is the one thing in my registry which i could not use much. I will not recommend it to anybody who won't be able to stick to this brand of bottles, becuase if you choose to breast feed the baby makes the choice of the bottle he likes :-)"
4,"Does the Job, But a few drawbacks","This item is very fast and somewhat convenient to use. We are first time parents and are trying to keep everything (Bottles etc..) sterile as possible. Yes, everytime we have used the the Sterileizer it has condensation left in the top lid and it is sometimes a little hard to open up. Overall, it is just simply faster and seems to get the bottles very sterile. We have used this product approx. 2 weeks. I would reccommend this product for other parents."
5,Can't live without it!,I don't know what we'd do without this steam sterilizer! Six minutes total and you're done! This is one of the best gifts we've received. I will be buying one for my caregiver when I go back to work! Highly recommended!
5,Love it!,I absolutely love using the Avent Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer for sterilizing the bottles! It's quick and easy to use. It sure beats waiting for the water to come to a boil and then having to boil the bottles. Definitely a time saver!
4,Quick & easy,"While we agree that a sterilizer isn't really needed, we liked having this one when we wanted to quickly sterilize our daughter's bottles. It also sterilizes other pieces like breast pumps, etc."
4,great for those without dishwashers,"We don't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer (bottles, breastpump parts, binkies, etc.)after washing with soap and water. It is easy to use, just throw items in, 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes. I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot. I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it. Otherwise, I love this sterilizer!"
3,Great item but watch out for burns!,"BE CAREFUL! Sometimes when you are lifting the steamer out of the microwave the top will separate from the bottom and steam will escape and burn your fingers. Other than that this is an AWESOME sterilizer, very quick and convenient. I wash my bottles, forego the dish drainer and put them right in this. When it's full I just add the water and throw it in the microwave and in 7 minutes the bottles are done. Great for pacifiers as well. I don't know if there is a taller model, but it would be nice to be able to stand up 8 oz bottles to sterilze as well. Riht now I just lay them down in this one, I assume that's ok??? Very quick and easy to use."
5,Best thing since sliced bread,"This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it. The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc. Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity."
3,Overpriced Rice Cooker,"Take it from me, a rice cooker works just as well and is faster. Also, one with auto shut-off is ideal and keeps the bottles warm. You also save having to load and unload your microwave with a basin full of water. 1/2 cup of water will get you up and running in 3 minutes or less. Don't get me wrong, the Avent is nice but overpriced."
5,Great for breast pump,"I have the Medela Pump In Style Advanced breast pump. This sterilizer works great to sterilize the breast pump equipment. I also use it to sterilize Avent bottles, nipples, and pacifiers. I read somewhere to sterilize teethers and toys that might go in the mouth once before giving them to your baby. Do not put teethers in this sterilizer...they melt. My mistake."
5,so far the cutest and best,"This is the cutest little stereliser ive seen, and so i brought it. its worth the money, and really easy to use. throw bottles in, with nipples and lids pour 7 ounce of water and microwave 4 minutes according to the watts of your microwave. it also comes with 4 avent bottles which im starting to use now my baby is a little bigger and can pull on the silicone teats.id reccommend this, its just cute....when u finish sterelising use the lid to throw in used bottles while you take out sterile bottles from the sterelizer itself."
3,Good concept but can't finish the deal,"In theory, this product is great - sterilize 4 bottles in 5 minutes. It's much easier than running an entire dishwasher cycle. The problem is that the condensation remains in the bottles and takes over a day to dry out. Avent says that the bottles remain sterile for 3 hours after microwaving them, so I'm assuming that my bottles are no longer sterile when they finally dry. This product needs improvement!"
4,More convenient than boiling your own pot of water,"Even though we're not using the Avent bottles, we still use this sterilizer with our Playtex breast milk storage system and Playtex bottles. Works well enough. Previous to this, we were using the sterlization bags that came with our Medela breast pump.Pros -Cleans up in a jiffy.Holds a decent amount of equipment all at once. I can sterilize 4 bottles, 8 Drop-In rings and 4 nipples at the same time.Seems to hold up well over time.Cons -You still need to clean your equipment before placing it in this sterilizer. This might seem obvious, but you'd be surprised. We came back one evening and the babysitter had used this to clean some bottles and nipples. The little droplets of milk left on the rings and nipples created annoying and very permanent white stains behind.You need to leave it in the microwave for a couple minutes, otherwise you'll burn your hands opening the top."
3,"Yeah, it sterilizes but...","Things don't really have to be sterilized. Even the head nurse on our hospital tour told us that. (She said that the dishwasher was enough.) We tried this, but the condensation takes forever to dry, so we are going to use our dishwasher and get our money back."
5,Avent microwave sterilizer the best product on the market,"I received the microwave sterilizer as a gift, and it is one of the best baby gifts I could've received. You pop bottles nipples caps and rings in the sterilizer in the microwave for 4 minutes and your done. It saves so much time that I can be spending my precious baby girl."
5,A MUST Have!,I did not register for this but bought it after my son was born. I was sick of boiling water or waiting for a full load to run the dishwasher. I found that when I used the dishwasher bottles and nipples turned colors depending on the food that we ate that week. (red when we ate pasta). This is a great thing to have and we still use it a few times a week and my son is 10 wks old.
5,Wonderful Timesaver!!,"This is a wonderful product. At first I wasn't sure that I really needed a microwave sterilizer and figured I could just use the dishwasher or just boil bottles and nipples. I got this as a shower gift and LOVE it soo much!! In about 4 min and 7oz of water, I can sterilize abt 7-10 4 oz bottles and nipples (that's what my baby is drinking out of currently). I just wash my bottles and nipples and throw them in this thing and put them in the microwave. As long as it is sealed, the things stay sterlized!! It's great :) Definitely a must have for any busy mom!"
2,A must have!,"This is one of the best baby products that I own! I actually sterilize my Medela breast pump parts in it every day! It is fast and easy. I can't imagine boiling water every day to sterilize my bottles and pump parts. Now, Medela says that you shouldn't use this for their products but I have never had any trouble and I have used it with both my children."
1,Thought I needed everything...I was wrong!,"I bought EVERYTHING out there when I found out we were having a baby. This looked like it would be a timesaver. Wrong. It was used once maybe twice, and I never felt confident that it sterilized her bottles enough. Out of all my purchases this one was the least nessessary. I felt better just washing bottles in the dishwasher and then boiling on the stove."
5,Love This Sterilizer,"I received this sterilizer as a shower gift and it is great. Quick and easy to use (10 minutes), I sterilize not only feeding supplies but my breast pump, his pacifiers and toys etc. A great product."
5,great item,"This is a great item if you don't run the dishwasher alot. We don't need to run ours daily, so the sterilizer works great and takes very little time. Get a drying rack though, because the items will need to dry if you're not using them immediately. Once I got a lot of bottles, I started running the dishwasher more and this became obsolete."
2,For Cleanaholics only,OK - I admit that I registered for this product and thought it would be an important item to ensure my baby's health. Then I spoke with the mother of six children (who are all grown and very healthy) who raised her children while doing mission work in West Africa. Guess what; she never had the benefit of sterilizing her bottles. She laughed at me and the rest of the overly protective americans she sees purchasing these items. Her suggestion - Hot soapy water and a cold water rinse - and lots of love.
4,A fast helper,I got this for my first child because like every new Mom I wanted things to be sterile. I loved the easyness of use. This way I also had the bottles and their nipples all in one spot rather than flying around in my dishwasher which also uses unneccesary water if used every day only because of the bottles. Overall I thought this sterilizer is very helpful and I will use it again for my next babies fist months.
3,"Very handy to have, but not necesary","This works well, I use the Avent bottles and Isis pump. I never could manage to fit everythign in the steamer the way they say it will fit. It does a nice job, and we tend to use it for teething toys now. The lid is a bit hard to get on and off some times and in all honesty, the dishwasher has a sanitize cycle that works jsut as well if not better. (...) But it does come in handy for a toy that has to be cleaned immediately and you don't want to run the dishwasher for one item."
4,Good statement of the basics,A relatively short and well set-out reminder of the key principles for ensuring that groups of people work together effectively as a system to produce excellent results. Each principle is supported with relevant examples and the key points are drawn out clearly.
3,"got a 14"" barrel out of the deal","i bought this for my sons project salvo. the salvo comes with a 10"" barrel. out of the box this felt cheap. the plastic is thin and wobbly, it moves from side to side and doesn't have that solid feel on the grip. he used it on one outing and it came loose several times. i took it down to the barrel and put his old shroud and foregrip on it. it looks cooler now and is solid feeling. i figure i got a 14"" barrel out of the deal."
1,Flexible leather?,"I am a New Testament scholar and make frequent use of my Greek NT. I have an old leather-bound copy that is both out of date and in need of repair. I ordered this Greek Testament from the American Amazon web site because I understood the binding to be leather and flexible, as per the desciption. It is neither, and I was very disappointed when I found that it was bound on boards with faux leather. If I had bought this item in the UK it would have fallen foul of our our 'Trade Descriptions Act'. As it is, I have put it down to experience because it is just too much trouble to return it all the way to the USA. However, I feel let down by Amazon USA!"
4,Serves it's purpose well,This is a good Greek New Testament. The print is large and the dictionary in the back is helpful with words that are difficult to translate. If you're looking for a Greek New Testament this is a good choice.
4,not quite up to the mark,"The Aland edition of the Greek New Testament (intended for translators, they say) is wide off the mark. This does not apply to the text itself (it is the Nestle-Aland 27th ed., and it's the best we can have) but to the critical apparatus offered.First of all, very few textual variants are chosen (and arbitrarily so), so that you may miss important evidence even for some crucial points. Of course, of these few variants we are told how all the Coptic versions stand, and what Athanasius (remember him?) quoted about. If the variants are chosen haphazardly, what is the point of all this, specially for translators?The third edition had a most elegant, big greek typeface, a delight to the eyes. In the fourth one, we've lost even that.So, stand by (or even switch to) the Nestle-Aland 27th ed., just in greek or bilingual. The apparatus, the introduction and the appendixes make it a truly scientific feat!"
3,A thought on authenticity,"Item was completely different from the listing. What I thought I was getting was the ""Greek New Testament: With English Introduction including Greek/English dictionary/flexible (Greek Edition)"" But I ended up getting an old version of the Greek Old Testament that was torn and contained no Greek/english dictionary which I need for class. I now have spent 25$ plus shipping for something I can't even use in class. I am disgusted by the audacity of a seller that seeks to gain financially at the expense of a broke college student; and at that rate to advertise a Bible falsely.I can only pray for such an individual. Furthermore, I can only advise you to stay away from a seller such as this one. Unfortunately people will do anything for money.-Charles Trimble"
5,The Greek New Testament,I Consider this book an excellent tool for serious students who are commited to study the bible. This includes a very good dictionary; greek-spanish.
3,Water logged book,It didn't say anything about the book being water logged. The pages are all stiff now. But it's alright I guess.
5,Great Greek text.,"I bought this not knowing it included the latin new testament too. A surprised, but not an unpleasant one. This remains, in my opinion, the best version of the greek text available."
1,Illogical,The whole book makes no sense. It is illogical. The book is not worth the price even if it is free.
3,Solid early poetry,"The sparse language and crisp images of Aliesan's later poetry is already visible in this early work - those less sparse and crisp than her more mature work. This work is less grounded in nature and myth than her later works and, hence, is one of the solid poetry books undistinguished from many others. However, once you've read her later work you'll want to read this.An example from sutra blues: ""coming on with the taste of this ache / i empts me out of detachment / behind the back of the angels"""
4,Very good flavor,"I love cappuccino, and I've been searching for a mix that tastes like the brand I got hooked on, Big Train, which I have been unable to find. I decided to buy Victorian Inn from Amazon based on reviews and just tried it today.Pros:* Very good flavor and price* Good to add to your regular cup of coffee instead of cream and sugarCons:* It was kind of weak. I had to use a lot of the mix to get a good amount of flavor in my cup."
5,Adorable Shelves,I ordered 2 of these shelves for my new son's sports themed bedroom. The shelves are really cute and very well made. They were easy to assemble and hang. I would highly recommend them. They look GREAT on my son's wall.
1,a great disappointment,"I was thrilled to see this design - finally something new and elegant. When the ring arrived, however, I saw that the stones themselves were cloudy and very poorly cut. The ring arrived quickly but was not up to my standards. I have other cz items and they put this to shame. The man I spoke to about returning them was very pleasant and (was it my imagination?) not surprised."
3,Overdone,"2.5-3 starsBaudolino is a clever look at how religious mythology starts and convinces those who invent it in the first place.However, it just dragged on and on and became extremely repetitive in the sense that Eco got his point across in the first couple hundred pages. He didn't need to keep hammering it home, 'adventure' after 'adventure'. A much condensed version would have been rated much higher.I felt I had to finish this book for some reason but kept picking up others in the meantime. In all I think it took 9 months to get through. This is my first Eco book (I also have The Name of the Rose on the shelf) and I wonder if they all have this problem."
4,Rough Trade Shops,All of the Rough Trade Shops releases are excellent. On note on this one though. The correct title is Rough Trades Shops: Counter Culture 05. Which is actually the 4th Volume (6 Volumes altogether) in the Counter Culture Series and not the 2nd as listed here. Check out the Amazon UK site for details on this series and other Rough Trade Shops compilations.
5,We are a Military Museum,Bools like this are kept in our research library so that people doing research on World War II can get the informatioin they need right here in their home town.
4,Good Portrayal Of How The 2nd Korean War Can Happen,This book gives a good idea of how the 2nd Korean War could begin and run. I thought it was very realistic on how it talked about the mechanized force battles in the Western Corridor and the light infantry fight along the rest of the front. It was missing the airborne and sea landings behind the lines which is a very likely scenario that does get war-gamed each year in the ROK.
5,Wonderful for children of all ages,"Todd Parr has a way with encouraging children to do things (reading) without being 'preachy' and by being FUN. My 3 children, ages 15 mos, 15 mos, and 5 years love all of his books. We just bought this one today and have already read it 3 times - it is still afternoon. My young toddlers are attracted to the illustrations, my 5 year old is attracted to the easy to read text and ""funny looking characters"". She often identifies her family or pets in all of the pictures."
2,reading this is a waste of time,`I usually love kids books and can spend hours sitting on the floor in a bookstore reading kids books. Not so with this one. Just a dumb children's picture book.
3,Too Long,"I liked the product, but it took almost a month to get here! The book itself was in good condition and was able to be used in my classroom."
1,There were no markings on the unit to id it as ACDelco only made in China. My mechanic refused to use it,There were no markings on it to id it as ACDelco. The only thing it said was make in China. My mechanic said it looked like a piece of crap and refused to use it. I had to buy a new one locally.
2,"Scratched, Smashed & Spoiled","In theory, this is a GREAT item. However, it arrived in a damaged package with most of the pieces missing. The one tool we received, the shovel, had chip marks. The canvas bag is cute like the picture...but it was dirty & stained from (I'm guessing) the packaging being torn. This item is not able to be swapped-out for a new one, so our only recourse is to return it outright, and buy a new one. In order to do that, we would have to pay shipping fees which we didn't before (because it was part of a larger order that was eligible for Super Saver Shipping). Also, several other reviewers mentioned the flimsy construction regarding the small screws, and that is a true & accurate assessment."
2,eh,The picture make it look quite a bit bigger and like it has more stuff with it than it actually does. It is actually quite small...and just comes with the three small utensils on the outside. That's it. When it is shipped...it doesnt even seem like it could be in the box because the box is so small.
4,ToySmith Garden Tote with Tools,"I bought this Garden Tote for my 3yr old grandson. He loves it, takes it to his backyard to help Mom weed. The tools are the perfect size for his little hands. The only complaint I have is the tote seemed a lot larger in the picture."
5,Cybersafety in an insecure world,"Joan Vos MacDonald has managed to give us web-surfers a much-needed security blanket. She has written an insightful book that makes us aware of the ignorance, and, perhaps, naivete, with which we approach the worldwide web. If any of us assumed that surfing the internet was a secure and, somewhat innocuous, exercise, Cybersafety: Surfing Safely Online has brought our mistaken assumptions to light. This book should be on everyone's MUST READ list, and should make its way to every parents Christmas stocking."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","This CD is just a list of words in Italian and English: ""uno, one; due, two"" etc. I don't know many children who will pay attention to it for long; I couldn't. If you like flashcards and repetition, this might be a good choice for you. ""Italian for Babies"" is a much better choice if you want to teach your baby Italian because it has ryhmes and songs, not just spoken words."
5,Johnny breaks the door down!,"1991 wasn't a really good year for blues but this album as well as John Lee Hookers ""The Healer"" continued to burn the flame during that dark peroid.EVERY track on this one is totally fabulous...Johnnys voice is at its peak, his guitar work is incendiary and the greatest thing about this album is the feeling throughout that Johnny and his band ( who are also 100% superb!) are really enjoying every moment of it.Billy Branchs harp work is stunning and Dr. Johns piano is practically in flames, especially on that last track "" You Lie Too Much"" (c.d version only/bonus track).This c.d goes so well together with Johnnys two previous c.ds "" Guitar Slinger"" and the merciless ""Third Degree""...they all have the same very high level of energy."
5,What a great surprise,"The jazz station in Austin played the title cut in 1989 or so, and I bought the album, my first by the artist. I was amazed at how good the guitar work sounded. I wasn't and still am not sure how he is regarded compared to other guitarists, but some of my favorite guitar licks of all time are on this album, right up there with Stevie Ray, Jimi, Billy Gibbons and a few others."
2,Too much Keith Wyatt,"It would have been nice to see how to set up a guitar the way Albert Collins set one up. I don't really care about how to play Albert Collins in standard tuning...and why would anyone care, it's hardly necessary.Way too much Keith Wyatt talking and way too little of Albert Collins relating to the viewer how he plays. A real dissapointment."
1,What A Waste Of My Time,"This book has to be the worst researched novel I have ever read! It reads like a ""Television Junkie"" who has seen too many ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" episodes on what the militia is about and decides to put down his beer and write a book. If you are looking for an entertaining book on what drives anti-government sentiments, read ""Unintended Consequenses"" by John Ross. It is a long read but well worth the time invested. As for ""Manhunt"" I wish there was a rating less than 1 star!"
3,another decent book,slater books are good but they are nowhere near tom clancy or other great authors if you like cheesy war movies then you'll like this book
1,My god he wrote another book really less then one star,When i was in high school i began too read the WWIII series following high school I joined the Army and Served in the 82ND ABN As a grunt reading his books then i was appaled at his obvious lack of military knowledge if this guy can remain an author i guess i can be the pope. if you wanna good military books stick with harold coyle or the great Tom Clancy as for this guy I wouldn't trade my last MRE ham slice for one of his books unless i ran out of TP.
2,Not for everybody,"I personally love classic movies because it seems that in the days before special effects and naked bodies, movies actually made use of structure, dialogue, and character development. So I rented this after several recommendations from my film-loving peers.Now I'm going to contradict myself here. If you haven't seen this movie, then I suggest you do. It is so well regarded that you should see what all the fuss is about.For me, however, it was such a disappointment that I turned it off before I got half way through. Each situation seemed like more of the same, which I suppose is great when you're enjoying it. But I found the humor forced and stale. Thus, the over-done performances (standard for screwball) grated on my nerves. See the movie, hopefully enjoy it, but be advised that it's not for everyone."
3,A light entertainment.,"I give this film only three stars based on the measure of a comedy: how much laughter it produces. This film induces some chuckles, but never gasping, roll on the floor laughter. Maybe it's a generational thing: I'm thirty-something. Cary Grant is a bit too prissy in his role for my taste, but Hepburn is great as a Lucille Ball-like walking disaster. The pacing is fast, and the film is never dull. Interestingly, this film bombed at the box office. It only picked up its reputation as a classic years later. Perhaps viewers were more discriminating back then."
2,If it weren't for the leopard...,"A friend and I tried watching this film once again recently, but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant. From the beginning, when Katharine Hepburn's character destroys other people's cars without a care, we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny. The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant. But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting. Grant's character is an unassertive, spineless person who is easily dominated. Hepburn's character is blindly selfish. Who could care what happens to them? The one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard."
5,A Must Have for the Classic Moive Fan,Bringing Up Baby with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant is one of the all time best comedy movies. This madcap adventure will keep you laughing from beginning to end. Hepburn and Grant have a perfect natural timing to their comedy and in my opinion they were one of the best comedy duos of all time. To me they were a much better match on screen than Hepburn and Tracey. The fine supporting cast of great character actors like Charlie Ruggles make this hair brain story even funnier. If you like comedies this is a must have movie for any collector.Bringing Up Baby (Two-Disc Special Edition)
4,happy with the movie,"i really enjoyed watching this, although I think the short story is a bit better. The item was in excellent shape, although there was a tear about a half-inch in length on the top of the case, probably due to shipping or something. The movie was perfectly fine, though."
5,Review of Bringing up Baby,Katherine Hepburn is at her best in this fast-moving comedy abouta girl who is causing major trouble for a professor who is trying to assemble brontosaurus bones for the museum. Bby is a tame leopard she has received.
4,Bringing up BABY,"Was a cute and entertaining movie. I am trying to view the old classic movies and even tho it was old, I enjoyed it very much."
5,Great classic!,This is one of my favorite classics and certainly one of my favorite Katherine Hepburn movies. I don't understand why it did not do better in ratings when it was in theatres. Katherine Hepburn is the funniest ditzy heiress ever and the movie has a nice quick pace. My kids even enjoyed it.
5,wonderful,on time in great shape better than expected. love the movie and no skips. what a deal these guys are always good
4,what hasn't Leonard Maltin said?,"There are few aspects of this film that can really be intelligently commented on that Leonard Maltin has not already fawned all over. All in all the film is great, one of the most amazing classic comedies ever filmed. Grant and Hepburn are great, the script is phenomenal, the cinematography is stark and pretty. It's really just one of those films that no longer needs much comment, if you haven't seen it you should. It's a classic that lives up to its reputation. (The Leonard Maltin comment was largely based on the fact that he has no taste in films, just spews up the standard responses i.e. ""Oh Casablanca is so amazing...you haven't seen Gone with the Wind?...it kind of makes me want to throw up how generic he is)"
2,for dog barking incessantly lovers....,"grasping at straws for comedy gold when the cacophony of that darn dog barking and being most uncooperative and shrill voices at the same annoying levels just kept me rolling over from....??? hmmmm, the PR surrounding this mess created such an air of expectation and the joy of wanting to love a film to be thus misinformed and deflated makes for one unhappy reviewer... madcap....mad yes, cap unclear... abs adore the leads and guess the leopard twins should have parlayed comical excitement but I have laughed so much harder at silent films i.e. Buster K. or Charlie... oh well, so sorry can't recommend except for cultural refs as it is included in the top 100..."
4,All was good until ...,"Its a good comedy and I enjoyed watching it. I was involved to the very end. However, all was going good until the last scene in the end. I strongly think that scene could be improved."
5,One of the funniest and greatest films.,This is a must see. It has a great storyline and is really funny. It's a real classic movie. They don't make them like this anymore. I highly recommend it to anyone. It's got great humor. Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are marvelous in it.
5,Screwball at it's best,"For anyone who hasn't seen this movie-you are missing out. Every time I watch it, it gets better. I love screwball comedies, and Cary Grant is the best actor of all time. His performance is phenomenal, and Kate Hepburn isn't bad either. The copy is great, the features are good. Highly recommend."
1,Not Funny,"I watched this movie because I had read reviews stating it was hilarious. It was not. This movie was not funny at all, in fact it was extremely annoying. Katherine Hepburn's character was so irritating I had a hard time watching the entire thing. As someone else mentioned, there was no chemistry between the two of them. Cary Grant made me half chuckle once. If you want a funny Cary Grant movie stick to Arsenic and Old Lace."
1,Disappointed...,"I normally don't write negative reviews, as I don't feel it's worth the time. This was an exception, as it was rated so highly on AFI's top 100 movies of all time, as well as other lists.The movie from the beginning was difficult to watch, with Hepburn being extremely off in this role, and Grant having a few good moments. The script never fully developed, and throughout the movie I kept thinking ""this has to get better"".It was a flop and panned when it came out in the 30's but somehow started to gain popularity to the point that it was selected by the National Film Registry for preservation. Director Hawks was fired for the film and Hepburn was forced to buy out her contract. Now it's a ""revered classic"". I think I'm missing something here."
2,A Classic Disaster,"This film was a box-office disaster when it was released in 1938 and remains so more than a half-century later. Even legendary film stars Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant can't rescue a terrible script and lousy directing. For all its frenetic pace, there isn't a single laugh or even a chuckle in the entire reel. One feels embarassed for the actors, particularly Hepburn, who bought out of her contract after the film flopped. She must have been mortified at the screening."
3,"Grant's Great, Kate's Mistake","Everytime I watch this hilarious antique of the past, I try to ignore Katherine Hepburn, a woman obviously with a sharp mind and intellect, behaving like an escaped mental patient whose just had a labotomy.She's so miscast it's a complete embarassment--but then there is the delightful, gorgeous, sexy and wonderful Cary Grant who should have taught Kate the Idiot some of his secrets of comedic timing. Maybe she had no other way of doing this, since her part was written for a brainless bimbo from hell. Her voice is so arch (ah, dahling...)and high it makes your skin crawl. I wish they could release a video/DVD version where Kate has been digitally replaced by Glenda Farrell-a gal who could have taught even Grant tons of tips about timing and comedy. Great flick if you only pretend Kate the NOt So Great (in this one, anyway) isn't there."
1,Over-rated nonsense,"Just finished watching this and I hated it. I normally like Grant and Hepburn, but here they have little or no chemistry and little in the way of direction. A fairly promising beginning decends into an unfunny mess. The plot is non-existent. The script is worse and the over-acting is idiotic and just embarrassing. (Barry Fitzgerald was never funny anyway.)An undeserved reputation."
1,The DVD wasa defective,"The DVD was defective, never got to watch the movie. Very disappointed. Why is it so hard to get a quality product these days,,,,,"
5,They Don't Make 'em Like They Used To,"Absolutely a wonderful film. The comedy in this movie is timeless, and it is something a family could enjoy together. If anyone is ever at a loss for something to watch, they could never go wrong with this one!"
5,The most perfect movie in history,"Undeniably Hawks was no deep like C.T.Dreyer, no epic like Ejzenstein, no original like Bunuel, no intense like Bresson, but this movie is the most perfect i've ever seen..."
5,One of the Funniest Movies of All Time!,Who wouldn't love Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in one of the best and funniest movies of all time?
3,Old School Comedy,"I wanted to watch this after listening to the commentary for ""What's Up Doc?"" Barbra Streisand and director Peter Bogdonavich claimed that the mad-cap mix-ups in Bringing up Baby inspired the twists and turns in What's Up Doc except the thing that drove BUB forward were the mistaken identities of the Jaguar vs the suitcases in WUD. That is where the similarities end. BUB was shot in studio and WUD used the city of San Francisco as its backdrop."
5,pure wonderful mayhem,fantastic wonderful film. this is the sort of film that all the modern romance/comedies are trying to be. i just love it. cary grant is delicious as the paleantologist and katherine hepburn extraordinarily and effortless hilarious as the social butterfly. watch it and enjoy the magic they create on screen. tom hanks and meg ryan films want to grow up to be Bringing up Baby!Aileen from the land of oz.
5,"Clean, funny movie","Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their prime! Hysterically funny movie about a ""madcap"" heiress and an archeological professor who is missing his ""bone"". One of the best!"
2,BROADCAST TV QUALITY IS AS GOOD OR BETTER,"Don't spend the high price for this DVD! Everyone already knows this is a ""5-star"" FILM; however, the quality of this DVD transfer is not that great. You can get as good or better copy by taping one of the frequent showings on TCM (Turner Classic Movies.) Most reviewers concentrate on reviewing the film itself rather than the quality of the DVD or VHS transfer, however, I want to emphasize that I was not impressed with the DVD quality. If you want the DVD strictly for the film, that's one thing, but if you expect a quality DVD transfer (considering the higher cost), you'll probably be as disappointed as I was. But, it's your call and your money--just don't say you were not warned. Ratings: Film 5, DVD quality 2. ADDENDUM 9/2009: The selling price was about $30 when this review was first posted. It is now selling for much less than half that amount, so go figure!)"
2,It's cute...but that's it,"I couldn't wait to put this border up to make my baby's room complete. It was not the easiest border to put up, but we did it. We spent a loooong evening trying to get it right. It didn't have enough self adhesive paste on the back so it kept peeling up around the sides. The next morning we could just peel the whole thing off. We ended up having to go out and buy wall paper paste and put it up that way. I think that if the walls were really smooth it may have stayed up better. We have textured walls which was what probably made it almost impossible to hang with the amount of paste that is on the back...Good luck!"
4,For Selena's fans,"It seems to me that Selena's family is still reproducing the same material again and again. The DVD Selena: Greatest Hits (2003) was in fact included as a bonus material in the CD Selena Ones (2002). As a Selena's fan, however, I bought both. I rate the DVD a 4 stars because the quality of the picture should be improved."
1,Cold,"There is nothing that Rattle does with Mahler that truly moves. In music that requires both awesome sound and spirituality, EMI engineeers fail in the former and Rattle in the latter. It is rather puzzling that, in our age of super-technical accomplishments, such is the case.I just heard a ""Made in USA"" 1950 Live recording of the 8th with Stokowski at the helm. Well, even with merely adequate monaural sound, the conductor makes eveything sound spontenous and right. At the end of the journey, you get a chill up your spine. Then you knew that this was the right way.... not Rattle on EMI."
1,Looking for another kind,"I find this shampoo, when diluted properly, hard to suds up and hard to rinse out. I know it's not rinsed out when my dogs white fur in still blue from the coloring agent."
5,Nice shampoo,This product really gets the coat white and has a pleasant sent. Great for white or spotted dogs or horses
5,Better than the OEM,Before my brakes would lock up if stepping on them hard. Now they come to a quick stop with no locking up.
5,This was my favorite baby gift for the first few months,"I received the sterilizer at my baby shower, but I had no idea how handy it would come in during the first few months after my son was born. Because I was supplementing with a bottle at every feeding (at least 8/day!), I went through my bottle supply every day. It was so simple to throw the bottles in the sterilizer instead of the dishwasher, which I obviously don't run every day. The sterilizer easily fit 6 Gerber bottles, nipples, caps and lids and only took about 20 minutes to run. It was so nice to have clean bottles round the clock, and when my son got a little older, I used it to sterilize his teethers and plastic toys.I bought this product almost as an aside, but I have to say it was my favorite baby product by far. The quality is excellent, and the only maintenance it needs is occasionally cleaning the residue out of the bottom with a little vinegar. I heartily recommend this product!!"
3,Quick and Easy but Pricey,It's definitely quick and easy and can hold a lot. A bit pricey though for what is basically a steamer.
3,Leaves Wet Bottles,"I hated how the bottles were drenched after the cycle was complete. I had to dry them on my other rack. Being they were wet when they were drying, seems like the sterilization got thrown out the window. I used this for a while then I resorted to manually washing with antibacterial soap and REAL hot water. Has worked fine so far. It's not a bad product per say, it just should really dry the items much better than it does."
5,Best Part of the Avent Bottle-Feeding System,"Avent probably has the most complete bottle-feeding system on the market today. But this sterilizer is my favorite of the bunch because it's simple and quick. Very good design, excellent materials and assembly. Not much to clean. (Avent recommends cleaning the unit with vinegar every few months to prevent calcium buildup. But I think you can avoid this hassle by not using tap water when you sterilize your bottles). Personally, I use purified water to sterilize my bottles. This should prevent the buildup of calcium deposits on the heating element. My coffee maker has lasted for quite some time now because I don't use tap water when brewing coffee. Same idea."
1,Infrequent Bottle User? Then buy Steam Bags instead!,"I am primarily breastfeeding, but I thought this would be useful for sterilizing pump parts and the occasional bottles, etc.. I discovered Medela Microwave Steam Cleaning Bags instead, and this thing went in the closet. I feel badly for the waste of money...but the bags are SO much easier!!! And not space consuming. Plus you can use them during travel, at the office, etc.. Much more cost efficient and useful!"
2,Dishwasher accomplishes the same thing,I just had to have this item when my son was born because I wanted to sterilize everything he touched. I primarily breastfed so I used it for my breast pump and the occasional bottle but you had to wash everything thouroughly before using it and I feel that a dishwasher could get the same steaming affect. I also feel that once your baby is a little older you realize that they don't need to live in a sterilized environment and it really is better to just thouroughly wash things with an antibacterial dishwashing liquid. I think if I were not a first time mom I would have realized that this is a useless item.
2,difficult to clean,I found this very difficult to clean and because of this it smelled when it was used. Although I thought it was useful I always wondered if it was really doing its job.
2,Save money: Boil a pot of water!,"Unfortunately, this product is not what I had hoped it would be. There are definitely too many parts to set up and assemble. You can save yourself time, money, and space in your kitchen by boiling water and drying it on a $2 rack!"
2,Waste of money,"This item does do what it's supposed to do, sterilize the bottles. But after they are sterilized, they are still soaking wet, and take forever to dry out. You still have to wash all the bottles and parts in hot soapy water before putting them in the sterilizer. For me it just ended up being much easier to put all the bottles and parts in the diswasher, because they get sterilized in there and you can fit more in there. I wish I would have known this earlier because I would have never opened the box. It's a waste of counter space, and not worth the money. Your dishwasher does just as good a job. Even if I didn't have a dishwasher, the washing out of the bottles in hot soapy water and drying them on a rack is just as good. They take the same amount of time to dry in the sterilizer as on the rack."
2,too bulky and not worth the money,"This sterilizer i ""had to have"" and was the biggest mistake. my daughter is only 3 months now and i packed it away in her closet. it took up a lot of space. putting the stuff in it was like a puzzle. the old fashion way is easier. or better yet check your dish washer for an extra heat feature i was doing twice the work. looks bulky is bulky and think about one thing whats 6 bottles? not enough for one can of formula anyway."
1,ONLY FIT AVENT BOTTLES!!!!!!!,"I am a Ultra PICKY 1st time mom and after my intensive research, I thought I got what I need.... NOT this one!This thing ONLY FITS AVENT bottles. There is no way you can fit others. They should clearly stated on the description! I have to return it."
2,Great while it lasted,"I loved using the Express Steam Sterlizer! However, after only 3.5 months of use, a part must have gotten fried. It stopped working and shorted out all the outlets in our kitchen. At least I was entertained by the sparks! I followed all the cleaning/descaling with vinegar directions, but the product still failed. I would have expected a little more for $70! Now, I bought the Especially for Baby electric sterilizer. I don't like using it as much, but we'll see if it lasts longer (at least it's cheaper if it breaks)!!"
5,Excellent Product,I strongly recomend this product is very easy to use and does an excellent job sterlizing bottles.
5,THE BEST!,"I think some of the other reviewers have forgotten the golden rules here, you MUST READ INSTRUCTIONS. This unit is not to CLEAN bottles and such, it's a sterilizer only. As in the instructions, as I'm reading, and typing from in front of me here... ""BEFORE EACH USE - 1) Before sterilising, wash all items in mild soapy water and rinse."" If after a while you're still getting a film, you need to rub neat salt on the bottles and nipples, it's a build up of milk fat.This product does EVERYTHING it states, and if cared for properly should last a long time, I purchased mine in September 1993, right 1993!!! And it works just fine to date after a long vacation in storage."
2,"If you have a Microwave, don't buy this product!","If you have a microwave, buy the microwaveable version of this Avent bottle sterilizer. It is much simpler, and can be transported easier as well. We tried the elctric version and found it to be a pain."
5,Best choice in bottle sterilizers on the market,"The Avent Steam Sterilizer takes up to 6 9oz bottles (with all the caps, nipples and rings), plus an Isis pump. Uses only 3oz of water (I use distilled water to preven scale buildup from tap water) and sterilizes in just 10 minutes! Also uses less energy than the Microwave sterilizer, for you energy concious people out there.An essential part of your baby gear if you use any bottle! Anything that is silicone or rubber can be sterilized in here (as long as boiling or autoclave is recomended as sterilizer method) i.e., pacifiers & chew toys!"
2,This is not worth the PRICE,"I received this as a gift at my baby shower, i did have it on my registry thinking that it was going to be the best sterilizer. but its so complicated. you have to take all the trays out, you have to continuously clean the inside. It was back in the box ASAP and got the Mocrowave Express one and that one works wonders.... AVENT EXPRESS STERILIZER is the one to pick."
1,Shorts Out,"We hardly used this unit, and used the dishwasher instead. I tried it 4 times and the fourth time, it shorted out and would no longer work. Don't buy it!"
5,Steam Sanitizers are good healthy gifts.,For those that don't use disposable baby bottles this is a great product to sanitize and recycle your baby bottles. I chipped in with a colleague to get this for someone as a baby shower gift.
2,Don't Buy It Unless U Get it as a Gift,"I got the Avent sterilizer as a shower present. The first one malfunctioned, so we got another. We used the second one occasionally w/o any problems for a few months. Now once again it malfunctioned, requiring us to have it replaced yet again. When it worked, it worked well, but I avoid spending the money."
2,waste of money,"Having our first child we wanted to get everything right. We bought or were given just about all the Avent products. We loved all the products but we felt the sterilizer was a waste. You have to wash the bottles/nipples, the sterilizer does not clean the products. Hopefully you use soap and hot water and according to the nurses at the hospital, our pediatrician, my obgyn and friends using hot water or a dishwasher is a suitable form of sterilizing.I wish I would've known that before I opened the package."
2,Don't bother,"This steam sterilizer was a waste of money. I used it once, and it left spots of water all over everything. It might have been sterile, but it seemed dirty. It also took forever to dry. I've been much more satisfied washing the bottles, etc... with hot, soapy water, or, occasionally, in the dishwasher. I didn't think I'd wash the baby's stuff by hand, but I've been happiest with the results when I do this. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it probably does sterilize the bottles. On the other hand, I wish I had saved my money, since I don't use it at all."
1,Black particle after the first usage,This is my first purchase of a bottle sterilizer. I found a patch of black particle at the base of the Avent unit after using of the first time. I am concerned that it may potentially affect my baby's health in the short/long term. Has anyone else encounter this before? I am sending this unit back.
5,Wonderful,"It is very amazing to be able to find all types of music, in a very simple and fast way, and the best of it at a very good price, I can not belive I was able to find Chayanne's music in just a click, I love Amazon, I recommended it 100%.""MAV"""
4,Excellent example of late 80's-early 90's electronica.,"A fine record. Melodic, great beat, and just plain pretty at times. Unique cover of Kraftwerk's ""Neon Lights"" is one of the most beautiful songs ever. For fans of late 80's-early 90's electronic, new romantic music, this is not to be missed. OMD is a find - an unappreciated and underated band that is really quite good."
4,if you like electronic music this is a good album,"If you are fond of electronic music and good songwriting you will like this album. The best songs on the album are Call My Name, Pandora's Box and Sailing on the Seven Seas. All the songs on this album are really pretty good. OMD on this album does not use brass as they did in the mid80s. This is a really synthesizer driven album."
4,simply marvellous,"este es uno de los mejores albumes q escuche en mi vida, omd no podria haberlo hecho mejor, el cover de kraftwerk es fabuloso,la cancion big town es realmente melodica y melancolica, es my bella, aunque a mi parecer los singles mas conocidos de este album ( pandora s box y sailin on the seven seas) no son las mejores canciones de este cd, andy en este album fue solo, pero no lo hizo nada mal, lamentablemente se separaron y no han vuelto a sacar nada nuevo desde el universal,pero no importa, para mi son los beatles electronicos"
2,The Old Stuff Is So Much Better,OMD made so much great music it is sad to see them create such boring fluff. The Kraftwerk cover is the best song by far. They should have stuck together as a duo and continued to produce music from where they left off.
1,Incredible disappointment,"4 or 5 stars?! Er....don't think so. The depth, grandeur and innovation of Organisation, Architecture + Morality, Dazzle Ships and Junk Culture are long gone. This slice of long-playing bland pop is like listening to Pet Shop Boys...without PSB's wit, charm, nerve or edge. Compare the boring and pretentious instrumental ""Apollo XI"" to The Pacific Age's affecting ""Southern"" for just one example of this sad decline."
4,Excellent but a bit too commercial,"If you are a fan of the OMD of the 1980's, then you may be a little disappointed by what is otherwise an excellent album. The daring lyrics and electronic experimentation has given way to a more upbeat and commercial rendering, but I suppose still with the ""old OMD sound"" just below the surface. The album grew on me tremendously, and I recommend it without reservation. All songs can hold their own, but of course the tracks ""Sailing on the Seven Seas"", ""Pandora's Box"" and ""Was it Something I Said"" stand out, but again these being a little too commercial for hardened OMD fans.If this is your first OMD album, or you are wanting to buy the first one, then do take a look at their ""Best Of"" compilation, as well as the excellent albums ""Crush"" and ""Architecture & Morality"" perhaps before looking at their other work."
1,Doesn't handle pancakes,"I bought this turner because my older plastic turners were getting blackened and losing small burned-off pieces when flipping pancakes. I bought this one specifically because it said it could handle high heat. After two uses, it is burning, melting, and flaking off just like my old ones. Plus, the angle is good, but the surface isn't slick enough for pancakes, so they fold instead of sliding easily on to the surface. The price was right but the product didn't meet my needs."
3,Loses its steam halfway through,"I picked up ""Seduced"" after reading great reviews about it, and I admit, I was disappointed. While the beginning starts off great with an amusing introduction to the ""Duke of Death,"" the story falters about the time the two main characters reached the castle home of the hero.At that point, the whole book began to sag at the seams, and started becoming quite Politically Correct. Hero...A duke mind you...Treats servants like equals and labors in the dirt like a construction worker. The maid hired to see to the heroine's needs, lectures her, and the heroine takes it... Ummm...Right.... Hero tells servants it okay to wander around the castle in casual dress.... Mmmmm.I found myself skimming the love scenes, to find out what happened in the main plot because I didn't feel the two main characters had any chemistry whatsoever.Worth reading for the first half, but I grew tired of the bickering and the modern values in historic characters."
2,"starts off well, then...",Lucien St. Aubyn is called the Duke of Death because so many of his relatives and friends have died. Most recently his brother was killed by Lucien's own bullet.Elizabeth Montclair is the daughter of an Earl who has very recent connections to trade and is barely tolerated by the ton.One night at a party Lucien compromises Elizabeth and he does the honorable thing and offers for her. Will they live happily ever after when they say they don't want each other and Lucien still has his brother's death hanging over his head?I found the beginning of this book very entertaining. I loved the push and pull between the characters. The end lost me completely. I found myself skimming pages just to see how it ended.I would not recommend this book.
3,Shrewish heroine,"I hate heroines who are shrews and termagants, forever sniping at the hero. And I also get irritated at stories where the hero and heroine constantly bicker - it gets tiresome really quickly. Alas, these are exhibited in abundance in this book, so much so that it got to be too painful to finish it. Elizabeth's conversion from shrew to devoted, loving wife was too jarring and unconvincing. Some of the humor worked well, but the humor didn't make up for the bad qualities of the story. Would not recommend."
4,...,"At first this book was a bit boring and I was so afraid I was going to end up tossing it in my 'Sell/Give away' pile. But it got very intense and I started really getting into it. One reason I knocked off a star was because Britton seemed obsessed with the details of rooms and houses and stuff like that, which gets annoying to the point of skipping paragraphs. Also, she doesn't have such a great sense of a humor. The jokes she tried to write were never placed at appropriate times. About two-thirds through the book I was really enjoying it and didn't want to put it down. It's an emotional story, which I've come to love about her books. They're always tense and dramatic, but just enough. The only other thing that I didn't like was at the end when she suddenly started referring to the heroine as Beth. She'd always been referred to as Elizabeth, so I had no idea who she was talking about for a few pages."
3,It's all about ...,"It's hard to input more than my fellow readers have but I feel I must. For a Fourth Doctor devote, I was a bit disappointed by the disjointedness of the story. Of course Tom Baker is disjointedness personified and so perhaps I sought too much. Werewolf (?), there wolf, there one heck of a story. Take some time and a cup o' and you'll get through this but don't expect to come out of it the same person you were before."
5,Great,Great Book and came earlier than expected. One of the best books I have read in a really long time
5,Fantastic Study,Jerry Bridges is insightful and penetrating in his writing. He is easy to understand and gets to the heart of the matter. I used this in conjunction with the companion study book. This really helped me put into action the principles he discusses. It's well worth your time.
4,Lyrical genious? Not? Who cares?,"Jesse Michales first 2 compilations (from 2 different bands) had 31 total songs, and they all had meaning. But, that's not why I bought them. I enjoyed their message, but more so, I enjoyed the sounds I heard. Sure, music is expression, but if all you care about is the message, go buy a book.I'm not sure how many of the songs from Jacknife to a Swan have messages, but I do know that the majority of the album sounds great. And as long as that stands in your opinion, lyrics that have a big message should be a plus, not the definer of the music you buy."
2,Grossly Disappointed,"I have to disagree with the other two reviews. This is by far the worst bosstone cd to date. Other than everybodys better (which has radio written all over it) and ways to suday (which is blues driven) I really dont think this cd has much flair or personality. I have enjoyed every cd to date from the bosstones as each one has been unique and the songs dont run together. Jacknife is, unfortuantely, very dull. Too much of that ska influenced boring keyboard. I hope the cd will grow on me, my reviewing peers are off on this one. . . . listen to pay attention or devils night outLooking forward to a live show soon"
1,BORING...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZz,"C'mon people, how could you all rate this cd so high?? This is a pile of [junk]. I have been a huge fan of the band since the beginning. I saw trouble coming w/the disappointing 'pay attention'. That cd had 2 of the best songs the band has ever written, namely 'Let Me Be' and 'Riot down on broad street'. The rest of that cd was boring. This cd promised a 'return' to their roots. What a complete lie!!! If it was supposed to be a return to their roots then where are the heavy/thrashy skacore parts?????? There are none. 'Mr. Moran' is the only good song on the cd. I have given up on this once great band. They are more interested in appealing to the masses and forgot how to write good/memorable songs. This cd is a snooze fest."
2,Buffer,"I use it at every water change and it works ok but seem to keep ph a little low, around 7.5 - .7.8."
2,Pretty pointless fictionalization,"The murders in Juarez are real. This movie is a badly acted fantasy of revenge and holy intercession. If there is a good movie about Juarez, I don't know what it is, but it is not this one."
5,Beautiful and touching,"I saw this on Channel 4 in the UK when it was first released. From the moment I saw it I wanted to go there and finally made it this year, to find it somewhat ruined by large scale tourism but still one of the most beautiful places in the world.This is a first rate account of a place and people at a time before the huge growth of tourism in the area. It follows the lives of a number of the inhabitants and very accurately captures the challenges and customs of the Naxi people. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
5,Marvellous,Fantastic to watch his again as I loved the TV series years ago. Watched first disc immediately now I can't wait to find time to sit down and see the second half
5,Heartwarming,"This book certainly tells our story, of how we waited and waited for a baby, and how everyone around us was also very excited when we got him. Maybe it's because our adoption is still so recent, but this mommy cries when she reads this book. When our child is old enough, I think it will be a very positive book for him."
2,Buyer Beware!,"First of all this vhs is NOT the Welcome To My Nightmare with full footage of the show with Vincent Price which would be great to have if it could be found at a reasonable price. This is really not a bad show but the sound quality is terrible so is the visual. If you are a hard core Alice Cooper fan this might be worth having for a real cheap price. I gave my copy to my nephew, that's just how thrilled i am with it, no original concept at all."
1,"Watch out: I received a Region 4 PAL, not playable in North America","Although there's no Region designation or info in the product description, I received a Region 4 version, not playable in North America. Although the description says NTSC, I received a PAL version, also not playable in North America. Sellers need to provide more information on the Amazon description page."
3,Sexsational,"I was expecting more... Not one of the selections called my name so to speak. Talented artist, the selections seemed weak."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"We have used Corelle products for over thirty years. This teapot is a disappointment ! It's not made from ""corelle"", it's not made in the USA.... it's a Chinese ceramic pot. If I'd wanted that, I would've gone to my local ""dollar store""."
1,Didn't work,"I'm not sure if I'm not using this right but it didn't work when I tried it. I basically used it to hook 2 computers up to a single printer but when I do that, the printer wouldn't work for either computer. I thought it would automatically switch for the computer that was using the printer... not sure if it's not meant to do that but it should! =)"
1,Broken Item and company refused to pay postage,The boot scraper would have been very nice had it arrived whole! It was broken and it was obvious that the company knew it was broken because there was masking tape holding together the broken iron leg! I contacted the company and they refused to pay return shipping. I shipped it back anyway (at great cost) and asked for another and an acknowledgement that they had received it. That was 3 weeks ago and I have heard nothing.
3,Nice cards.,"These are nice cards, easy to use, great to learn pronunciations. But, if they're not for learning meanings of words, then leave off of the meager examples. Otherwise, add some more meaningful examples and make them a little bigger."
4,Great watch,"I am overall very happy with the watch. It's nice looking, well made and easy to read the dial. My only complaint is the date window. The window and numbers for the date are so small that even with very good vision it is hard to read."
3,Mediocrity at it's finest,"It's a watch. It functions as expected but the face is MUCH smaller than the image led me to believe. Fortunately, this was a gift and the end recipient loved it."
1,not what I wanted,I was looking for the newer cartoon. This one is the Older drawn looking one. My son won't even watch it. Total waste of money.
2,disappointing!,"This is a newly released DVD?? It is soooo old, the quality is TERRIBLE, the voices are different - there is some really odd singing - and it does not seem at all like the current episodes we see on TV. Glad we just rented it from the library!"
1,Originals are better,I would not suggest this movie. Springtime Surprises strays from telling the original stories written by Stan and Jan Berenstain as the earlier movies do. The values and morals in this movie are nothing like those in the books. I hope that Sony Wonder will return to making the Berenstain Bears movies as they originally had done--with the values that are represented in the books.
4,"All this, and muscle cars too!","The action is fast and furious, there's a stripped-down juiced-up story in addition to a respectable plot, the characters have histories, and there's a lot of yummy tumbling going on. The author's deep affection for her characters is evident, and her enthusiasm is contagious -- I enjoyed the romp!"
5,This is a Crazy GREAT BOOK!!!,"I've been a fan of Tara Janzen's Crazy series. The Steele Street Boys are rugged, rough, battle ready and militant guys. Yet, they are tender and very romantic. Crazy Hot was the last in the series for me, and I'm glad I finally got to read it. I think Quinn is the most romantic of all the guys, and I just love how he doesn't take Regan's reticence at the end as the final word on the relationship. He loves this woman, and putting macho aside, he goes after her and gets the girl who has been his dream since he was sixteen. I identified with Regan and I think other women will. She's a reserved, sensible kind of woman. But this camouflages the passion that is contained in that package. Quinn was the right guy to pull it out of her. The intimacy between them was wonderful. This is a great read."
4,"Cliche, but fun","3.5 starsTara Janzen's books are hit and miss for me. The first one I read, I liked a lot and then the next two left me uninspired and a little bored. This was just plain fun. Sure, it follows all the cliches and the girl is a little air-heady and has a real TSTL moment, but what can I say, I liked it. Take a way black, Black Ops group, a National Hero Air Force Pilot, a Dinosaur bone specialist, some specialized gun, diamonds, a teenage fantasy, and fast cars = Enjoyable read. If you don't expect too much but want a fast, hot read (including several scenes on a muscle car), this will not disappoint you."
3,Exactly as Expected,"This is billed as romantic suspense, but it's pretty light on the suspense part. I would view it more as a romantic adventure. We have a nice mix of handsome, bad-boy, secret agent military men; beautiful, quirky, damsels-in-distress; and lovely, powerful cars. As expected, sparks will fly. Having some dinosaur fossils thrown into the mix was an unusual twist that I appreciated. All of the characters are essentially one-note, and sometimes contradictory. For instance, buttoned-up and proper Regan has no problem with several exhibitionist trysts, and doesn't even have any regrets about it. But, when the rubber hits the road, the reason we pick up these books isn't plot or character depth. We read books like this for the fantasy, and in this, the book succeeds. It's a nice quick read, and I'll surely read more in the series."
5,Loved it.,"OK, so there may have been a little too much of the 'love at first sight' vibe going on, but otherwise, this was a great story. It definitely made me want to get the next book in the series."
4,Good Read,"Not a great deal of new information but there are gems that are not commonly presented or known. The focus is substantuly Ruark and Africa. Much better, fuller book than Someone of Value.This book is somewhat disorganized and backtracks quite a bit along with some double presentations of information. The author wanders about on the trail and seems at times not to know exactly which direction he intends to go or what his intended destination is.Despite its shortcoming View is a book that Ruark fans should have on the shelf."
3,"Great entertainment, mediocre sound...","Top Hot is a wonderful story of boy meets girl. There is a misunderstanding, a few obstacles and of course lots of dancing. This is a very enjoyable movie starring some of the greatest entertainers that Hollywood has ever known. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers prance through the dance numbers flawlessly, and with a style all aspiring dancers look up to. The only problem I found with this product was the mediocre sound that is so common in old musicals. The problem being that whenever a musical number starts the sound is uncomfortably loud and the words are not understandable. However, this flaw did not reduce my enjoyment of the movie and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a classic."
4,Top Hat Lover,This is a good copy of Top Hat. I was pleased with the picture quality and sound quality...
1,disappointing,"poorly made, sound would go in and out and the plot was boring, would give this movie to even some one i hated. prue torcher. Expected alot more from this dont buy it"
4,Happy New Years,"My mom and I watched this movie every year on New Years Eve. It has some great music, and Fred Astair dancing. Happy New Years!"
3,Top Hat,"Good movie but pictured on cover as in color but in b & w. Didn't say anywhere whether it was black and white or color. Otherwise, pretty good"
1,Tape I received was defective.,"Sorry, I cannot write a review for this product because the one I received would not play. All other tapes I have received from Amazon have been very good."
3,Cannot be used with the 6V battery pack... Only AA's....,"But otherwise, I'm sure it's a great little car. Looks terrific out of the box. We've owned quite a few Tyco RC's in our day, and although my boys manage to destroy them all, I find them a good product (and definitely more sturdy that the competitor's R/C cars). However, we've accumulated quite a collection of those 6V rechargeable battery packs, and we ordered this car with the full intent of using them. The car shipped definitely can NOT be used with the battery pack, contrary to the description, so beware.... and stock up on AA's, 'cause my boys can burn through a set of AA's in an RC car about every 2 hours. Ugh...."
5,buy if you want i just dont recomend it!,I bought this toy on 9-18-04 & mine was defected you could buy it but mine was defected so i wont highly recomend it unless its just for display other wise its a waste of money parents i recomend buying r/c cars that have an antenna both on the remote control & the car itself!!!! (p.s. i just rated it because it has a cool design!)
4,Not too bad,"My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she couldn't get it to work. Well, I wanted it and I registered for it anyway. We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked. I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great. Just add a little water, throw in the bottle, and in minutes it was perfect. My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer. But other than that, it's another great product by Avent."
3,Does the job,The cons:-no on/off switch-no way to know when the milk is still at a safe temp unless one tests it every single timeThe pros:-no alternative-safer than a microwave-works for baby food tooYou decide
3,"It works, but there's have to be a better one out there!!","I couldn't breasfeed my daughter so she have been a formula fed since she was born... So, for me this was a most have because I have to warm up my daughter's formula all the time. The problem with this warmer is that you can't let it finish, because if you do it the formula will be normally TOO HOT!!...The solution: If you buy concentrate formula, just warm here the concentrate formula and after it's hot you could add the water...In this way is going to have the perfect temperature for your baby to eat...But if you use powder or ready to use you have to count the minutes and take out the bottle before it's done."
4,Worth it as a time saver,"This product is very easy to use. I find it much easier to warm bottles this way than running them under hot water which, at least at my house, can take a long time. It heats very evenly. It's nice to be able to hold the baby or take care of something quick while the bottle's heating. You have to experiment a little to figure out the best settings and timing but once you've got that it's easy! I do agree with other reviewers, the major drawback is no on/off switch!! Just be sure to get in the habit of unplugging it right away."
1,too expensive and not worth it,I was hopeful about this product as I like other Avent products. It lacks an on/off switch which could be a potential danger. It also tends to overheat bottles. I took mine back and got a much less expensive model that works much better.
2,No on/off button.,"We have unfortunately left this warmer on on several occasions. There is no on/off switch, therefore the unit has to be unplugged to turn it off. When left on, eventually the water evaporates and is left empty and HOT. It seems there are cheaper units that do the same thing with on/off switches and even auto shut off options like the ""Quick Serve"" by The First Years. We will be buying that one and throwing the Avent one out."
2,No Auto Shut Off is a Joke,"While the warmer works ok on its primary mission of heating the bottle, there are two features that should be included:1. Auto shut off.2. There should be a light that indicates if it is on or off. I do not mean the heating element light."
2,Does not have an automatic shut off,"An OK gadget, but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well. It does not have an automatic shut off, so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil. Must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this!"
1,Not worth the money,"This warmer is a HUGE disappointment! It overheats the bottles unless you stand by it and unplug it right away, and there is no on/off switch so it has to be unplugged to turn off, seems very unsafe, I have to leave a note on it for babysitters. I wish I had investigated more before I bought it. I love the Avent microwave sterilizer so I thought this would be equally good, but I was wrong."
1,Uh...no,"This product is garbage. It has no ability to heat a bottle to specific temperature, and will eventually get the temp to near boiling if you are not careful. No different than water in a pot on a stove, you have no temp control. It's going back. I don't understand why it is do difficult to find a product that will get the temp of a bottle to the right temp, and keep it there."
1,Not worth the money,"This warmer was aweful. I bought it for my kitchen, used it once and started walking to the other in my bedroom. Yes, it does have a fill line, and the directions are pretty easy to follow. It takes forever to warm and it has no on/off switch. This was as much a safety factor as a convenience issue. I returned it and bought a cheaper warmer that works much much better."
2,Not worth the money!,I registered for this product and received it as a shower gift. It gets too hot and also does not have an off/on switch. You have to unplug it! The water also evaporates really fast if you leave it on so that it will always be warm (for easy access when your baby needs it) It was pricier than all the other warmers. I took it back and bought one for half the cost at [local store]. It is much better than the Avent one and much cheaper.
1,"I like Avent Products, All except this warmer","I received this warmer as a gift and had to return it. The warming of bottles was very inconsistent, there was no way to accurately measure the amount of water needed for each bottle and you had to unplug it each time you used it. There are other great warmers that have pre-measured water holders that allow for hassle-free bottle warming. Avent has great products however they need to work on this product."
3,Mixed Feelings.,This warmer was excellent for bottles 3 oz. or under. Now that my son is up to 5 oz. it takes forever to heat the bottle. During the day I can keep my eye on the clock and try to anticipate the more than ten minutes it takes and not make him wait. It's the night time feedings that are a nightmare when he wakes up demanding a bottle and screaming for ten minutes until it has heated to luke warm. I'm hoping it'll work better with the little jars of baby food. I'd still recommend this product but only for 4 oz. bottles and under.
2,Not the bottle warmer for me!,"This is probably one of the only baby gadgets I have that I am absolutley not pleased with. Many moms made a good point about the on/off switch, (which wasn't my concern). And yes, I pour the water in right after the bottle is in place! It just doesn't heat the bottle up fast enough! It's much faster to heat the baby water in the kettle on the stove, and make fresh bottles for every feeding!!!! Some of the new inventions don't make your life easier. Then again, every MOM is different, and you have to go with what works for you and your baby!!"
2,I have a better one for you...,"A friend of mine was terribly disappointed in the Avent bottle warmer, so went out and bought The First Years brand. She RAVED about it so much that I went out and bought one (I was using the stove-top to heat the bottles to that point). I love it so much. Yes, I ocassionally have to run bottles through a second time to get them heated up nice and warm - but it is still easy and convenient. It was [inexpensive]"
1,The worst product I have ever owned,"Does not get any stars...I wanted a convienient safe way to heat a bottle ..granted this product does heat quickly....but if you turn your back for 1 minute you have a bottle that is to hot...many times I had to sit it in cold water while my child screamed. There is no shut off on it so it must be unplugged or the water evaporates and is then a fire hazzard. You would think it would only heat to a certain safe temperature....but it is scalding if its in for more then 3 minutes, there are to many distractions in life to use this product safely...I do not allow anyone sitting with my child or even other family members to use this product...I tell them to just sit in cup of warm water.....very unsafe product....and dangerous ."
1,too hot,i had this.. when you put the bottle in you have to be right there to warm it up.. if you wait too long (even at lowest setting) i'm talking after 5 - 10 minutes - it's too hot and then you have to wait again for it to cool. it could burn the baby's mouth if i didn't test it first...i gave it away..
4,Good bottle warmer,"Although I don't like the fact that I, and worse yet my husband, have to remember to unplug this warmer, I really like it. I use it for 6 to 8oz bottles of just-made formula and it does a great job. It would be nice to have an automatic shut-off, but setting a kitchen timer is no big deal to me. I am very satisfied with this warmer and I plan to buy one as a shower gift for my sister."
2,Not worth it..,After everyone told me not to buy this - I bought it. The bottle would get hot but the liquid would be cold...just not worth the effort! You are better off using room temperature water for formula or using hot water to heat up.
3,Better than nothing,"I have used this warmer for about 3.5 months now, and it does the job but needs improvements! It is nice that you don't have to wait for it to ""cool down"" before using it again. & The food warmer on top is nice too. However I hated the fact that there's no on/off switch. It is a huge pain pulling it out of the socket -- with a spark-- (ehhh!) and in those wee hours accidentally bumping it when tugging at the cord and spilling water everywhere! & It also is not the most consistent. The directions for the heating times are way off, so you have to play around with it until you figure it out. But it does do the job."
2,there are better warmers out there,"1. no on off switch2. no on indicator so if you forget to unplug, you may not notice.3. uses lots of water to heat so takes a lot longer than the kind that uses steam to heat the bottle4. doesn't automatically turn itself off5. Water gets everywhere when you take the bottle out.6. overheating easy to do.I love most of their stuff but wish I hadn't bought this one. I bought another brand recently and am much happier with that one! Heats the milk faster, has an on/off switch. Automatically turns off when the water is evaporated. Much nicer."
4,Love it!,"I love this warmer. It is so much more convenient than running the bottles under the tap to warm them. As long as the directions are followed along with common sense being used, this product is a wonderful time-saver. I have used it both for breast milk and formula without any problems."
1,You Don't Need This,"What a useless gadget. You can accomplish the same bottle-warming task in the same - or less - time using hot tap water and bowl or large measuring cup. This bottle warmer doesn't even have a timer, so you still have to watch the clock while it's heating your bottle. Depending on your bottle size, it takes 4+ minutes to warm, and you have to stay on top of it... miss your timing by a little bit and you've got scorching hot milk on your hands. My bottle warmer found its way back to Target."
2,Avent dropped the ball,"I used this for a short time. It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there. A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add).I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much. It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on. There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't. Oh well."
1,Very Dissapointed,Definitely think it's not worth the money. It does heat the bottle way too hot so be careful! I hate that the light goes off throughout the heating and you never know how much longer you have before the bottle is ready. It needs a timer. I just don't think it's worth the $40. And you can't see how much water you need - I always end up over filling it.
4,nice product,"I've got this one and is really fast and really safe!!!I really like this Bottle warmer, the only bad this is that you have to unplug everytime you won't use it"
2,Unless you're standing there watching it...,"No beep-beep timer on this; no auto-shut-off -- so a frazzled first-time mom or dad can easily wind up with a bottle of scorched breastmilk. SO UNCOOL. And, crying while pouring the milk down the sink, you *still* might not learn your lesson with that first bottle. If you own the product and its design flaws bug you, call Avent and tell them. If you don't own the product, you're better off placing your milk bottle in a bowl of hot water, which at least won't scorch anything. If you still think this product is one you want, by all means go for it, but, especially if you are warming breastmilk, DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THE WARMER UNTIL THAT LIGHT FLASHES."
2,Heats however it boils over,"We used our warmer for the first time, and have continued using it because we are afraid to melt the bottles, however, the water boils as soon as it gets hot, and the boiled wateer spills all over the place. I've burnt myself numerous times to count, and get frustrated each tim I do it! I have reread the instructions, and we are doing it right...i would suggest buying a different warmer!"
2,hot spots,"I tried this product and found that it created hot spots... I checked the temp of the formula and it was ok, then for some reason I checked it again, and it was way too hot. If I had mixed the bottle, it would probably be ok, but the fact that it seemed to heat inconsistently scared me, and I just don't use it anymore. So if you use this product ( or probably others like it ) just make sure you check the bottle carefully and make sure it is not too hot!"
2,Not Impressed!,"My husband and I bought this thinking that it would warm up our bottles. Since I have had this warmer I have overcooked and undercooked the milk. It has never heated up my daughters bottles warm enough in the 4 minutes, and it overheats it if you use a higher setting. I was extremely surprised when we got it home and noticed that there was not an on/off switch. Had a read the reviews before purchasing this warmer I would not have done so. When your baby is screaming because of hunger having to wait another 2 minutes to get it warm seems like eternity! I use Advent bottles and the microwave sterilizer and I am completely satisfied. I think the warmer though needs a few changes."
1,A waste of money for us!!,"I find this item was truly a waste of money for the person that gave it to us!! I used it a couple of times, but found it much easier to heat bottles the old fashion way...or to breast feed was much easier...and QUICKER."
3,Better than the alternative,"I have been pretty happy with this product. I use it at night for those 3 a.m. feedings since my bedroom is on a different floor from the kitchen. Its better than waiting for the water to get hot from the sink. During the day, I just heat water in the microwave and place the bottle in the warm water which takes about the same amount of time as this warmer. I agree that it should have an on/off switch because hunting for the outlet in the dark at 3 a.m. can be a real chore!"
2,Not a good product,This is the only Avent product that is a big letdown. It has no on/off switch which is a huge design flaw. I have to unplug after each use. I must REMEBER TO UNPLUG otherwise it is a fire hazard. Who needs to worry about 1 more thing while your baby is crying?
1,120 Degrees?,"Ok, what a piece of [...junk]. Besides all the lack of features, on/off switch and such this thing is piece of junk. In the manual it says, and I quote "" 8) When the water has reached the correct temperature, the light will come on and off to indicate that the water surrounding the bottle is being kept at a constant temperature."" end quote.That would lead you to believe that you can leave it and it will keep the milk at the right temp. reguardless. Well, when I checked it the milk was at 120 [...] degrees!So basically this is just as accurate and helpful as placing it in boiling water on the stove. If you dont take it out just at the exact time you will have CURD! Then again, maybe I am asking too much. Whatever. Dont waste your money.B."
2,Bottle Warmer,"This unit must be unplugged to turn off which is a nightmare to remember at night and to try to do holding a baby in your other hand. Remember - put it on a GFCI outlet! Once it is left on for awhile (my husband left it on for hours), it doesn't work right again as it melted the unit."
3,Not Worth It,"This warmer costs more than it's worth. We have to stand there while it's ""warming"" a bottle until the light turns off and then when we check the bottle it's still cold. Having to stand hawk eyed over a bottle warmer with a crying, hungry baby isn't fun...especially when it doesn't warm the first time around. On the other hand, if the bottle stays in a minute too long, the milk gets so hot that we have to set it in cold water. There has to be something better out there!"
1,no need to buy,"I got this product as a gift. However, I never use it. It is simply much faster to warm up a bottle with some hot tap water!"
3,Great with Avent Bottles,"We received this as a shower gift. It's great with any Avent product - heats quickly and evenly. We like to use the Dr Brown bottles. If you are going to use Avent bottles, this is the warmer for you; otherwise, I'd check out generic warmers. We have to put formula into a Avent bottle, then transfer it to our Dr Brown's. Course, in the middle of the night, who wants to keep your baby waiting while you juggle bottles?"
2,I didn't believe what others had written.,"Once I tried it, I was a believer, it was very inconsistent. The same input resulted in different output almost every time. I'd rather warm the bottles with hot tap water."
3,Just okay...,It's nice that it's small and doesn't use a lot counterspace. I wish it was more accurate on the settings. You really have to play around with it to know what temperature setting suits you best. Bottle sometimes comes out still cold or too warm.
4,Good product,"The bottle warmer works as advertised. I like the aesthetics of it and it lasted without a problem through my son's eating-at-night period.It may overheat the bottle if you don't monitor it, but it worked well for us. Just keep an eye on it."
5,Great Warmer,"This is a great warmer! Keep in mind with any warmer, you have to keep an eye on it. We used it primarily to heat breast milk. It's great because you can adjust the heat and it's CONSISTENT. When you first get it, set the dial in the middle, put a bottle of refrigerated milk in it and then keep testing it at 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc. until you know how long it takes at a dial setting to heat the milk to the temperature you want. If you know you want more time to let the bottle heat, turn it down and do the same test. Likewise for less time. We got it so we set the dial at a position and left it for 3-4 minutes and got exactly the temp we wanted. We used it for more than a year and the thing was consistent the whole time. It's espeially great because you can leave a nanny with instructions and feel more at ease that she'll get it right."
3,pros and cons,"I am a first time mom. I thought the warmer being an avent product must mean it was a superior product. I do like the warmer with a few exceptions. It is small. When warming, it doesn't send steam pouring out the top like alot of the other warmers. It is fairly consistant with warming times. The only thing I really don't like is there is NO AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF. I have been using it for 6 months and we still forget to turn it off sometimes. We haven't burnt the house down yet, but it is a concern."
3,"It's ok, but may not be needed","My mom got me this for a present because it used to be that you had to heat your bottles for formula. Now you can feed the infants room temp, warmed, or cold. I make the bottles as I feed so I feed room temp. and actually, this is what my baby likes most. Sometimes I buy the ready to feed and store the bottles in the fridge so I warm them, but honestly, it takes a lot longer to do that than to just make the bottles.I think that this warmer actually takes longer to warm the bottles than to just put the bottle under hot water. Just my opinion."
3,It does the job.,"I purchased this bottle warmer, however; I barely use it. It does do the job however, since I am using breast milk it's actually a lot easier to warm the milk in warm water before feeding it. So, yes it does do the job but I don't find it most convient. I think this would be much more convient to mothers who are formula feeding and need to warm a bottle quickly during the middle of the night."
2,not pleased,It does not have an on/off switch and the warm times are not specific which leads to over warming. There is no fill indicator so it often overflows when you put the bottle in. I was very dissatissfied with this product.
2,If you have hot running water you don't need this!!,I found this product to be a waste of money. I can accomplish the same thing by running the bottle under hot tap water. It also takes forever to heat up the bottle and you have to constantly check on it or it will overheat the bottle. I also found the no on/off switch to be very inconvenient. We have forgotten to unplug it many times. If I had to do it over I wouldn't bother with this product.
3,Good Warmer but with Design Flaw,"This warmer is quick and easy but I agree with the other reviewers that the biggest drawback is that is does not have an on/off switch! To turn it off you must unplug it. I found this out the hard way...I thought it was auto shut off and left it on. The water evaporated and the unit was really hot to the touch. I just don't understand why it wouldn't have at least the on/off switch...an auto shut off would be ideal. Still, it was one of the few warmers that would accomodate the Avent bottles. It is a little pricey too considering the design flaw, but overall it is not a bad warmer."
5,Mine has an on/off switch,"I love this bottle warmer. We use it to heat refigerated breast milk. It's small enough to fit in the diaper bag, so it goes with our baby to Grandma's while I am at work. She appreciates it because it is a lot faster than swirling a bottle around in a bowl of hot water. As for the complaints about the on/off switch, Avent must have added one, because mine has one."
2,Overheats most of the time,"The lack of an on/off switch is not a big deal. This bottle warmer has a light that goes on and stays on till it reaches a certain temperature then goes off, then on again when it starts cooling down. This allows it to maintain a constant temperature. What bothered me is that after it heats the bottle and the light goes off I would expect the milk to stay at a constant temperature and not to continue overheating...and it overheated everytime. I could not change the baby and leave the milk in it for an extra minute or 2 or it would get way too hot. Now on power level number 2 it was pretty much the same thing it just took longer to heat and with a crying baby every minute seems like forever. Number 1 is way too weak unless you let the milk sit there and know you will use it in a half hour then it is just warm. I returned mine and switched to powder formula and use sterilized room temperature water. No warming, no headaches and my baby loves it."
1,"Lacks important features, like an automatic shut off","I like several of the Avent products, so I thought this bottle warmer was probably worth the extra money (it's one of the pricier models offered). After owning mine for about a week, I returned it to the store where I bought it and purchased a much less expensive model that actually works better (the Munchkin brand). The Avent warmer worked okay, and the variable heat feature could be valuable, but the darn thing did not have a timer nor an automatic shut off. I became very annoyed trying to keep track of the time, etc. which defeated the purpose of having a bottle warmer for ""convenience."" I will say that it warmed evenly (about the best on the market as far as heating evenly). However, on a couple of occasions I didn't get the bottle out right at the 4-minute mark and it over heated the contents...very hot. Had this item had a timer or an automatic shut off feature it would be a much better value. Definately not worth the extra money!"
1,For this price I expected more,"I bought this warmer thinking it would help me with middle of the night feedings, but after testing it out once, I promptly returned it. I should have listened to the reviewers and not thought they were being petty. This thing has no auto shut off, the user has to set a timer for how long to leave the bottle in and even though there is an ""off"" switch, you still have to unplug the machine. Not very helpful at 2 in the morning when you are half asleep and have a frantic hungry baby. For the amount of money I paid, I would have expected much more than a glorified hot plate. I ended up getting the First Years version for less money and while that one is not perfect, it beats the Avent model. Too bad too, because I have been happy with the other products in this brand line."
1,no off switch,"There is no off switch or automatic off... which in the middle of the night unpluging the thing is not always done. So we have burned ours up. I would not recommend this unless you can always remember to unplug it. However, it does heat up breast milk or formula fast."
1,Avent Bottle Warmer,"This is the WORST bottle warmer invented! Besides the high price ,it is horrible. Not having an on/off switch is a safety hazard. You have to stand by the warmer to make sure you take it our immeditely when the light shuts off. Otherwise the warmer will continue to get hotter and hotter. So for those of you Mom's who think its a good warmer ,think again! I bought the First Years warmer and it works wonderful. It steams the bottle and shuts off automatically. And you can leave it plugged in. Sorry Avent you lost my vote on this one!"
2,Use only with Avent bottles,"I borrowed this warmer from a friend. I had planned to use Avent bottles, but ended up using Dr. Brown's. I can definitely say this bottle warmer doesn't work well with Dr. Brown's bottles. It may work OK with Avent, but I don't see how it could be that much different. The bottle warmers that use steam to heat seem to be more effective (and quicker)!"
2,Needs improvement,"I use Avent bottles and love them. However, I am not thrilled with this bottle warmer. First, it does not have an on/off switch. Second, if you do not stand over it and constantly check the temperature of the bottle it will overheat the bottle. This unit does not have a timer or an auto shut-off so you have to watch the clock while heating the bottle or the water continues to get hotter and hotter. I am disappointed in this product. I plan to toss mine out and either use tap water or another brand bottle warmer."
2,express warmer not so quick anymore,"have had this warmer for only 3 months and it does not get as warm as it did a month ago. seems to be slowly dying. also, the no on/off switch is a major hassle. having to plug and unplug every feeding is terrible. for 40.00 i would have bought something that was more well thought out."
1,Disappointed,"When I started using formula, I would mix several bottles up at a time and keep them in the fridge. I thought the bottle warmer would be great for warming them up quickly. It's not really that great after all. There's no on/off switch, so my husband and I were constantly forgetting to unplug it (which can be a fire hazard). It seemed to never heat the bottle by the amount of time indicated in the instructions (it would always take longer-with a screaming hungry baby-that's not good!). We always seemed to either put too much water in it or not enough (an included measuring device would be very handy, but there's not one). However, there is a fill line in it but if I filled it to where the formula in the bottle came too (like the instructions say), it would still overflow. I haven't used it in a while, so I may try it again when I start my baby on babyfood. Overall, we were very disappointed with it."
4,Very Convenient!!!,While the absence of an on/off switch is really my only complaint. We have found this to be a very convenient tool that takes the guess work out of warming food.
2,This warmer lacks important features,"Not knowing what to look for in a bottle warmer, I was attracted to this model because it was small in size and didn't take up a lot of counterspace. I have no complaints about its warming capabilities, but after using the warmer several times, I found I really needed a few more features than it offered:The unit does not have an automatic timer, which means YOU have to keep up with how long the bottle has been in the warmer. And when you are trying to deal with a fussy infant, it's easy to lose track of time and overheat the bottle.The unit has no Off/On switch and must be unplugged after each use.Another small annoyance is the bottle does not sit flat, but floats unevenly in the water while heating.I finally purchased another model which included these features."
2,not a warm review,"Of all the great products made by AVENT this one is the only one I dislike. I gave it a ""2"" because the unspecified water measuring for bottle warming lead to bottles floating and possible chamber overflowing (a messy cleanup for early a.m. feedings). It lacks an on/off switch and must be unplugged every time (which at 3 a.m. is not always easy to remember ),thus the placement of the unit must be near an easy to reach outlet. The warming time, according to manual, is not always correct and overheating is usually the result if you walk away.It does have a few good points : a) it accomendates AVENT bottles and not all bottle warmers do. b) cleaning the unit is EASY. c) allows warming of both reusable and disposable bottles. d) warm food, frozen breastmilk, or formula quickly. e) IT BETTER AND QUICKER THAN WARMING UNDER TAP WATER !!"
2,not so warm review,"AVENT has great products however this one is not one of them. Here are a few reasons I feel this way: This warmer lacks an ""on/off"" switch and must be unplugged with each use (which with early a.m. feedings is not always easy to remember). The absence of this feature also requires unit to be placed near an easy to reach outlet at all times. Due to the absence of any premeasured units for filling water into chamber, overfilling causes bottle floating and messy clean-ups. Lastly the specified times for proper warming in manual is not always correct , thus overheating is usually the result if you walk away.This product does have a few good points: It fit almost all bottle types (both reqular, disposable and wide mouth). It's easy to clean. It allow fast warming of breastmilk (frozen),formula and baby food(that has been refrigerator). and finally IT'S BETTER THAN WARMING UNDER TAP WATER!!!"
1,Very disappointed!!!!!!,"Well, I too bought the bottle warmer and didn't think for a second that it doesn't include things like automatic shut off or timer. I thought that is the whole purpose of the bottle warmer. Basically after 3 months of using it I gave up because I find myself forgetting to turn it off and having the milk too hot. I now use my electric kettle. My very pretty and expensive (I may add) bottle warmer became a gadget collecting dust."
1,I HAVE A CHEAP WAY TO DO THIS,"I CANNOT BELIEVE PEOPLE BUY SUCH A GADGET! I ALSO HAVE THE ADVENT BOTTLES AND MANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS...SO FAR SO GOOD. I HAVE NO COMPLAINS. WHEN MY BABY WANTS HER BOTTLE, I STICK A WATER FILLED MICROWABLE BOWL(NARROW AND A LITTLE TALL)IN THE MICRO ON HIGH FOR A MINUTE.I REMOVE MY BOWL, NOW WITH BOILING WATER AND PLACE BABY BOTTLE. I HAVE THIS DOWN TO A SCIENCE. I WAIT 2 MINUTES AND WE ARE DONE.THIS ITEM DOES JUST THAT, WHY SPEND SPACE ON COUNTER TO HOUSE THIS UNIT?????"
2,Don't Waste the Money,"I don't think this is worth $40. You can achieve the same outcome with hot water, a pot and stove. And I agree with other complaints about the lack of a timer and uneven float with the bottle. Spend the $40 on something your child will get more use out of!"
2,Don't Do it!,"This Product line has always gotten 5 stars from me, but not wih this item. It's a WASTE! You're better off just warming up water and letting the bottle sit in it for a minute or two. And least you won't be outed twenty or thirty some odd bucks. This can be very dangerous to baby if you are not careful. I purchase one for myself and one for my cousin since our babies are one month apart. I used mine a few and it over heated the bottle and I followed the directions and everything. At first it feels warm but when you shake the bottle sometimes you feel the temp of the bottle getting warmer and that tends to happen because the center of the bottle gets the hottest. It has NO timer or on/off button so you have to babysit the thing. BE CAREFUL you may scortch babys mouth with the hot milk. Lord forbid if you forget that it has to be unplug it will overheat and konk out like the one I purchased for my cousin. After that she cursed me out and went to warming milk on the stove."
2,**,"It needs to be a little more practical. I brought this product with the expectation of it being a step one and done type of product. It turned out to be a step one, two and three.... I don't have time. My microwave is easier becuse I have one button to push for baby food and milk."
4,Wonderful Product! Read the Directions!!!!!!,"I have been using the Avent Express Bottle and Babyfood Warmer for almost one month and it works great every time! It heats the formula evenly and to the same temperature as long as you follow the directions. I also use it with Dr. Brown bottles and it works great! Although my warmer has the on/off switch, I agree that there should be a timer or alarm that signals when the bottle is ready, as this is the only problem I have...getting distracted with my newborn and leaving the bottle too long in the warmer! Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. I like the convenience of using it at night upstairs in my bathroom, along with formula stored in a cooler bag, so that you do not have to go downstairs in the middle of the night. When your baby is hungry, those extra minutes make a huge difference!"
2,Disappointing features,"The warmer is indispensable to me, yet if I had to select a warmer again, I would reconsider the purchase. It is an overpriced and ""dumb"" appliance when you consider the only way to turn the warmer off is to literally pull the plug."
2,Not worth the money,"This warmer is not worth the money. I bought the Quick Serve Bottle Warmer which is manufactured by the First Years. The Quick Serve Bottle Warmer is only $17.99 and it is much better than the Avent warmer. Unlike the Avent Warmer, the Quick Serve takes a small amount of water to create steam to warm the bottle. The Quick Serve automatically shuts off after the bottle has warmed up."
2,So-So product,"My baby is an Advent baby. I love all the Advent products, but was a little disappointed with this one. The bottle warmer, is maybe too good of a warmer, as it tends to overheat the milk even before the recommended time limit. The timings really should be precise."
1,The product is a joke ... don't buy it,"This warmer is an absolute joke. Thank God I was able to return the thing and get my money back. It would be a great product if it had a thermostat that allowed you pop in the bottle, and it'll only warm it to the safe level and keeps it at that temparature. But it doesn't. Any jug with hot water will do the same. In the end we prefer to use the Microwave now ... it's quicker and thus more reliable as the bottle is warm in 30s."
1,why a warmer??,"I don t know why anyone would buy a counter top warmer. They say that microwaving a bottle ""zaps"" the nutrients in the mix. Well, there are no nutrients in water. My wife and I first heat the bottle of water in the microwave then add powdered formula mix. We have it down to a science and after heating the bottle for about 5 seconds at a time you can figure out how long it takes exactly. He's 8 months old and we've been doing this since the beginning. For you liquid formula people...Oh well!!"
2,Overheated ratings,This bottle warmer doesn't have an on/off switch which is dangerous if you are a drowsy new mom. My biggest complaint is that it overheats breastmilk and ruins it if you don't stand there and watch it. Breastmilk is like gold and to have ruined so many ounces of it is just heartbreaking. It does fit their bottles but it's hard to tell how much water to put in around your bottle. This company is so pro-breastfeeding - they should really have a more accurate warmer on the market.
3,bottle warmer,"This is a good bottle warmer if you're looking for no frills. However, it should have an automatic shut-off. And to be honest, the best way to get around a hungry crying baby is to have a thermos of warm water ready for quick feeding. I figured this out two months into it and now our lives are SO much easier."
3,Almost burned the house down,"I love this product for its efficiency, but I hate it because it lacks an on/off switch. I almost burned our house down at 3:00 in the morning because I was so sleepy that I forgot to unplug it and it started smoking. Thank goodness the fire alarm went off. Just be careful when using this product."
2,"DO NOT BUY THIS, BUY THE IQ VERSION",The device is pretty good however it is very hard to time the warming and very easy to overheat the bottles.a few weeks after my son was born we went to my in-laws where we duplicated most of the necessities and I bought the IQ version of this warmer. It is so much better. Has so many setting! A few friends that copied our registry i had switch to the iq version. Spend the extra money!
2,Temperature control?,"This thing certainly ""warms up"" but no reliable thermostat to ensure that the content of the bottle remains at a reasonable temperature. If not careful, the bottle will get get way too hot..."
4,Nice for the most part,"I think the bottle warmer works great- granted, it is the only one I have ever used. Mine *does* have an on/off switch- it seems like some peoples' didn't. An automatic shut off would have been a nice accessory, but this warmer can warm a bottle very quickly! The only other thing that kind of stinks is that I can't warm up bags of breastmilk- they are too wide to fit in the warmer. Overall, I am pleased with this warmer. A lot of the problems other people seem to have can be solved by reading the instructions."
1,Needs improving...,"The light is intermittent, it only comes on when its heating up and the shuts off when the heater has reached its intended temperature therefore when you look at the warmer you cannot tell from the front that its on. I think there should be two lights, one to show its on and another to show its heating up etc. Because of this poor feature, the warmer has been left on accidently many times.The bottle does not sit flat, but floats unevenly in the water while heating.Avent, you need to improve this before a fire is caused because a Mom had a screaming hungry infant and forgot to turn off the bottle warmer."
1,Try a different bottle warmer before you buy this one,"I bought this warmer because I have the Avent bottles, which I love. I thought that because the bottles were larger than normal, I'd have to buy the Avent warmer...NOT TRUE! I'm not sure about other models talked about in previous reviews, but there is an on/off switch on the back. Though this warmer does heat consistently, I hate using it. It does not have a timer like most warmers, so you have to constantly monitor the bottle and keep checking it to make sure the milk doesn't overheat. I find this difficult when you have a hungry baby on your hands. All the instructions have for warming times is a chart that can be difficult to decipher, at best.TRY OTHER WARMERS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ONE! (The First Years has a really good one that shuts off automatically when its done) I wish I knew then what I know now!"
4,Very useful and fine... but can be improved,"I like this a lot when I need to warm baby's bottles (I am not using Avent bottles but it works fine). It heats the milk evenly and to the same temperature as long as you follow the directions.But there should be a timer, or the light should turn off only when this is warm. The directions are way too complex for a mum and a crying baby. Be more simple!"
3,Okay,"This worked great when we were mixing breast milk and formula. Now that my son is on formula completely, it's just quicker and easier to make it as he needs it, rather than hearing him cry while it heats up. The warmer itself works great, very even heating, and we're looking forward to trying it on solid foods once he starts on that. However, for the cost, there are other options that are probably just as good."
5,Works Great!,"This is a great warmer. So easy, my husband can even use it. I don't have to worry about him having it too hot. It warms evenly and perfectly, whether thawing frozen breastmilk or warming fresh breastmilk. I believe that it requires you to unplug it to turn it off for obvious reasons-#1 being safety. As far as warming bottles in the night for nighttime feedings and being able to see, I would suggest using the formula in the the small bottles that doesn't need warming. This is a great warmer so far and we are looking forward to using it with baby food."
2,"Does the job, but doesn't have a power switch!!!!","This warmer works wonderfully for warming bottles. It can hold standard or larger diameter bottles easily by adding or removing the plastic basket. It also has a cord storage area under it (able to wrap the excess cord around and secures itself). But the only problem was that it has no power switch to turn it off and on. I have left in on numerous times when running off to work. I have come home later to find it on, hot and without water (if it was not completely full in the beginning). It's not simple to pull the plug out of the wall either. Sometimes had to wiggle at the plug to get it to come out. Other times could not pull hard enough and had to get daddy to pull it. Did it's job, but for the price it did not do it easily enough for me!"
1,save your money!,"Save your money and skip this warmer! For the cost of this warmer you would think it would have an on/off switch. I had it for 1 night & at the 3o'clock feeding I forgot to unplug it. It continued to work after that but, what a fire hazard! It also didnt warm our 4oz bottles very well. We had to warm it 2 times. I went with the 1st years night and day warmer and love it!"
3,Needs updating,"I used this book as a text in a gerontology course. I taught the course the last time in 2007, 4 years ago, and it was out-of-date then. The statistics and analysis are from the mid-to-late 1990's. Much has changed since then. To be useful as a textbook it needs to be updated to reflect changes in demographics and federal policies. Example, Medicare Part D is not discussed."
3,"Good, but not THAT good.","This is a entertaining ninja movie but I think is not one of the best. Here's why:The sound was terrible (to much bass), the action scenes were not well choreoghraphied, the movie is kind of slow, the ninjas look lame with those silly demon masks and there are no stealth missions.The only good stufs were the blood and gore and some special ninja fighting tricks.If you are looking for a cool ninja movie then this one is not for you. The dvd trailers show Shadow Hunters and Shadow Hunter 2, I think that those movies are WAY more better than this one because the look high budget action-packed!!!Adios."
5,highly recommend this pan,This grill pan is now my all time favorite. Cooks evenly. Spouts on both sides pour evenly with no spills. Cleans well.
3,Not bad...but not great,"Not sure if i didn't do this right...but we got no onions to sprout. The radishes roots grew very quickly - and then it was hard to thin out and we haven't actually seen a radish grow...just lots of roots. Same with the carrots...which came along just after the radish.We really like it at first and It's great to view the roots, but we didn't see the vegetable like the picture shows...and bummer on the onions!"
1,Another dud plant growing toy,"Although a great idea, this has turned out to be another plant growing toy that just doesn't do much. Each of the three plastic tubes are not larger enought to grow a plant of any significant size. You do see a reasonable amount of small roots thru the tubes, and get green plant growth above the tube, but's that about it. After MANY months, the carrot(s) and radish(es) never got larget than about 1/8"" wide and the onions never sprouted after repeated tries. Followed all directions exactly as described."
1,Arrived broken,The wooden stand arrived broken in 4 pieces. The sides detached (designed that way) but the little rings around the tops had snapped off. Kind of disappointing when my nephew opened it up. Seems like it could be a cool product. Maybe I'll dig out the wood glue.
2,Not Worth the Cost,Not easy to grow anything in these small tubes. The plant didn't show roots and ended up rotting out and not really growing. Would not recommend.
4,Excellent,"Ryang has skillfully complied research from the many of the most contemporary and skilled researchers of Japan's resident Korean community. While not overloading information, a clear picture is presented which can help both the general reader and the academic researcher. The only negative aspect of the book, besides its outrageous price, is the fact that there is not a contribution by Michael Weiner, who has possibly contributed more to the study of Koreans in Japan in a historical context than anyone else. Overall a good book to see the anthropological views cast since De Vos."
4,A Pleasant Surprise!,"I have tried a few of the Simply Asia bowls, and find this to be one of the best they offer. It's a quick ""meal in a kit"" (and it *is* a kit that requires some assembly) that comes complete, right down to a spoon. The best part? The noodles aren't dry; they are ""fresh"" udon noodles in a vacuum bag, along with freeze-dried vegetables, an envelope of dried spices and a packet of sauce. Though the instructions call for microwaving the bowl, in a pinch, I have been able to make the soup adequately with boiling water from a teakettle.Though this will never be mistaken for hot & sour soup from a good Chinese restaurant, it's a rather delicious and easy lunch or late night snack that is surprisingly satisfying. It's definitely worth keeping a few bowls tucked away in your desk drawer or kitchen cupboard, and Amazon's price for six bowls is much more cost effective than buying them in the grocery store. Thanks, Amazon!"
1,Day light robbery,Don't bother this dvd consist of only two video tracks and i think its a day light robbery. It aint wirth the money.
5,love this song,this is great song from a very good cd it has rock sound to it shakira at her best A++
3,good contemporary salsa,"This album is quite good, good production values and well performed, plus the guy really knows how to sing."
2,Goldmine - not for single users,"If you have an inclination to buy this book, look at ACT! or MS Outlook instead of Goldmine. These books are written by Goldmine Certified Consultants. Do you really believe they are going to give their secrets away...when they charge thousands a day?You will find the only real solution to any problem beyond the GoldMine Unknowledgeable Base (which I believe they purposely do not update) or their Customer Disservice Department is as basic as it gets. FrontRange (owner of Goldmine) constantly refers you to Goldmine Certified Consultants. It is obvious that FrontRange is leaving individuals and small business owners ""Out On The Range!"""
4,Pretty Good to Me,"First off - Goldmine will help you automate your business processes, so it's an all purpose tool. This book does a lot to show you how to make parts of the tool work. Becuase GM is so capable, it has a steep learning curve. Once you get to a certain point, your can do your business, manage your prospects, standardize communications, do reporting, etc. GM is flexible enough to adapt to almost any small businesses processes, so guess what, setting it up in the first place is a bear. Learning to set it up is harder. This book will help if you already have some knowledge of databases. It is not a Developer's guide, but it does go beyond the manuals that come with the system. I was hoping when I bought it to be able to set up GM from the information. I could have, but to save time we hired a developer to get ours set up, and periodically need maintenance. It's a good introductory reference, but not a course."
3,Battles and Leaders,"Be careful what edition of this book you get. The original edition was a large, useful collection of primary sources. However, another edition was put out which, while still a collection of primary documents, was much shorter and could not be considered definitive at all. The latter was the one I wound up with, and I didn't get much use out of it."
3,Mismatced,"The bowls are nice and exactly what a go player needs, but be warned: they are different sizes, shape and color. The bowl in the front image only looks like one of the bowls. The other is a darker,and has flatter sides, and fits less stones overall. The second bowl barely fits all of the stones it holds, while the first (the one in the forefront of the image) fits the same amount with room to spare. While the second bowl is ok and is of as good quality, it does not have as nice a stain as the first one, or has as convient a shape. I was expecting a matched set, but instead I got a mismatched one. I don't regret buying the bowls, I just wish that the information on the bowls was more accurate."
4,Wonderful song writer,Joe Melson wrote wonderful songs with Roy Orbison. He has a very pleasant voice. It's good to hear him sing some of his songs and those done with Roy Orbison. This was an excellent find!
4,"Great part, installed quick, working in my 97 saturn","Great replacement part, reliable and affordable. Got the old out and this in no problem. Check out youtube channel richpin06a, this guys has great video tutorials, including one on replacing this beast without impact tools. It was easy, just wear glasses and if you have a small metal pipe, cinch the end so your wrench doesn't fall through. I almost got hit a few times.Anyway, I support this part and will buy more from them in the future. DIY auto repair is a great alternative."
5,No side cutter,"Note these do not have a side cutter. I ordered in haste to replace my lost favorite without realizing this, but it's my own fault. Anyhow, I figured it might help to say something here so others didn't make the same mistake. Happy with the pliers otherwise. Channellock has consistently good quality for me."
5,Great information; to the point and concise!,"I work for a telecommunications company and thought I knew how to use voicemail. This book taught me things I never thought of and has helped me deal with customer issues more efficiently. I also thought the suggestion to leave a customer a 'thank you' voicemail late in the evening was impressive. Bravo, Paul LeBon!"
4,Elephant in an envelope,The book is well written - a good focus on the ASDM. I would like to say the information is well compacted into 188 pages but I cannot. Including the index and table of contents it barely sqeaks by with 160 pages. A bit more command-line would have certainly filled the missing 28 pages. I still like the way the content was presented; 4 stars.
5,Completely Awesome Book,"This book 'Securing Your Business with Cisco ASA and PIX Firewalls' is absolutely awesome, I wish I could give it siz stars. The sections that VERY CLEARLY explian problems that you can run into on the internet and the sections on how to deploy a new ASA device are fantastic. The Step-by-step, saved me about $2,500 - $3,000 dollars because I didn't have to hire a consultant to do the installation for me. I looked at the ASA Handbook as suggested by another reviewer, although that book is pretty good, I found this book to be much more simple and to the point."
1,Waste of money,"Sadly, this think book is all but useless for anything beyond a very standard configuration of Cisco's (new) ASA devices.It hardly provided more information than what you get with the Quickstart guide that's included with the appliance itself. That means some simple scenarios with an Internet connection, a DMZ and a main LAN, with a bit of NAT thrown in.Half the book is generics, such as the importance of protecting your network and other such items. No explanation of the how's and why's. You're better off downloading the technical documents and white papers off Cisco's website. Or even poring over the PIX/ASA command line guide, even if you intend to use ASDM.A much better choice is the ""Cisco ASA and PIX Firewall Handbook""."
1,Be careful when ordering !,"Product seems well made. Too bad I can't use the KVM cables.Just because it shows a picture of one of the ends does NOT mean that you will be able to use the other end. Male/female mismatch between monitor, keyboard, and mouse ends prevents me from using the cables that I bought.They do NOT match up with my KVM switch.No way to know, I suggest that you do not buy cables on-line unless the vendors shows the configuration of ALL the ends."
5,Ice,I remember seeing this advertised and could not wait for it to start. I was great and can't wait for Season 2.
2,"Could be so good, but repetitious","Because this came with high reviews from friends and viewers we decided to purchase. But one season will be enough for me; it just repeats, and repeats...on and on. After you have watched one item, they skip onto something else, then come back and 'rehash' everything you just watched. While the show itself could have been so interesting, they took so much away. The material is fascinating and the men that do this kind of work are a totally different breed and I admire that. However, these shows could have been cut down to one disc and been far more entertaining. I will not purchase other seasons."
2,Poorly executed clone of Deadliest Catch,"I had high expectations for this series, but after watching it my primary reaction is one of disappointment. This would have been a terrific two-hour special. But the producers had a lot of time to fill, and fill they did...with repetitive, monotonous footage, weak story lines, artificial and manipulative ""drama"", and lots of time spent repeating the same material over...and over...and over.I don't think I've ever seen a series that was so obviously stretched to fill the available time. The latter episodes were unwatchable thanks to the endless use of tired footage and shameless rehashing of earlier material.While Deadliest Catch is immensely watchable and thrilling to the end, this series falls far short of the high bar set by that program."
4,Be prepared to watch it non stop,I spent an entire 9 hours on Sunday watching the entire season. Very addicting and interesting.
4,"Quite interesting, but repetitive","We don't have cable, but I had often heard about this show, so when 'Season One' came out on DVD, I picked it up. It is an interesting show, but after awhile it did become a little repetitive. I know they are trying to make each episode exciting and engaging, but I would have liked perhaps a few episodes where you concentrated on maybe only two of the drivers and went much more in-depth with a specific run, instead of trying to go back and forth between the 4-5 drivers, with a little information on each of them. Still, a good show and one I enjoyed watching multiple times."
2,Overdone,"I was very excited about this series when I ordered them. Unfortuntaly the series is not very documentary, but more of a fictional dramatized character. It seems the producers have tried to dramatize something that is just not there. Big, Spectacular, Over-dramatized are all words that fit the series. All the episodes would have made ONE single good two-hour show."
1,Ice Road Truckers,"I returned this product, unopened, and my credit card has not yet been credited for the return."
4,Enjoyable continuation for Lonesome Dove,"This was a pilot for a TV series that was the follow up to the mini series ""Lonesome Dove"" done by Bill Whittliff. Originally it was to be called, ""Lone Justice II"". I believe the series name was to be, called ""Ned Blessing - His life and times"". The powers that be didn't pick the series up - but the pilot is out there under this different name for rental, ""Ned Blessing: Return to Plum Creek""Ned Blessing: Return to Plum Creek. This shows me that they can come up with good material for TV shows but then drop the ball when it comes to keeping them. (Witness ""Firefly"" and others). I enjoyed this movie, and purchased my own copy from Amazon. Check out the supporting performance of Gregory Scott Cummins who was going to be nominated for a guest starring Emmy award if the series got picked up - oh well! [...]"
2,DOES NOT Contain the Movie Trailer Music,"Shame, Shame!! Other than the dazzling Tim Burton visuals, the most mesmerizing and alluring thing about ""Big Fish's"" TV trailer ad is the beautiful acoustic sound of the tune ""Your Move"" by YES. It moves the trailer along, and makes one really WANT to see what this is all about. And it shows (or so I thought) a refreshing awareness and enlightenment on the part of the film's ""decision makers"" about outstanding music from what is arguably the world's most accomplished and virtuoso band in existence today, YES. How in God's name, then, could the song not be included in the soundtrack CD?? This is an insult not only to YES, but to the viewers that are ""drawn in"" by the trailer they saw on TV, only to have the haunting music that attracted them in the first place omitted from the soundtrack! Instead, we get Eddie Vedder --- great.DON'T buy this CD!"
2,PLEASE -- Let me clear up the confusion..!!!,"I can't believe the amount of confusion about the SONG ON THE TRAILER!! It is ""Your Move/All Good People"", by the band YES. It is from ""The Yes Album"", released in 1970. The strummed instrument that you hear, a vihuela, is played by the band's guitar virtuoso, Steve Howe. Trust me on this: go out and buy ""The Yes Album"" CD. Then buy ""Fragile"", ""Close to the Edge"", ""Relayer"", and ""Going for the One"". Your life will be changed forever, guaranteed. Oh, and DON'T buy the ""Big Fish"" soundtrack, as a protest against the unforgivable omission of this song from the track list. How could they have left it out??"
1,I really don't understand...,I'm here searching for the Big Fish's soundtrack JUST for that music on the trailer.Thank's to the guy who wrote about the Peter Gabriel's song.Saved me a few bucks...
4,Excellent Music from a Good Movie,"Being a longtime Burton/Elfman fan, I was pleasantly rewarded by both the movie and the music. Actually during the movie, I thought that some of the weakest parts were the other songs used (not composed by Elfman) but I don't mind them being included on the CD. This movie showed that both Burton and Elfman can tone down the weirdness for a while and make a solid movie with a great, subtle score.No, the song by Yes is not on here -- but it wasn't in the movie, so why on earth should it be on the soundtrack?? Heck, the Peter Pan trailers used Coldplay, but you don't see that on the CD -- this is because the people who design movie trailers are essentially salespeople, NOT the same people who make the movies.For those interested: The instrumental music on the Big Fish trailer was from Black Beauty (the beginning bit) and Edward Scissorhands (the end bit) -- two other excellent scores by Elfman which I highly recommend."
4,Class President Review,"The story is about a fifth grade class that is electing a class president and Julio's best friends are running for president. The setting takes place at school and the main characters are Julio, Arthur, Cricket, and Lukas. Julio secretly wants to run for class president but he doesn't want to run against his best friend. I think this book is fun to read because it is exciting and surprising. Arthur breaks his glasses and the class raises money to pay for them. In the end Arthur doesn't have to pay for his glasses. In one part of the story Julio baby-sits two crazy twins. They are a lot of fun. This book is great ."
1,I thought this book was kind of boring.,"I read a book called Class President. This story is about some kids named Julio, Cricket and Lucas who are trying to get elected for class president. I give it a rating of one because there's not enough details on the book! There is no special part except when Cricket becomes Class President and every time Lucas tries to get elected Cricket gets another vote so Lucas wants revenge (but that's another story). Finally they all agree that Cricket is a better Class President. I just didn't think it was very interesting."
2,Thunder Road,"Combining aliens, the millenial fear that recently ran rampant, and cultic mania into a net of terror this book takes readers back to the turn of the millenium as the world waited on its ending. Livestock mutilations and satanic symbols send the residents of a small town into a battle between good and evil that may or may not have its origins on earth. Perhaps the most chilling aspect is the fact that none of the speculative horrors conjured up by the words are too unreal, much of what is written here has some basis in the newspapers."
1,GARBAGE!,I love how no 1 mentioned the smelly dark yellow urine (I drink tons of water so I kno it's the pills) or the fact that they stink like fish & taste horrible. They're also huge pills 2. I gave them a star 'cuz I HAD 2!
1,Not impressed,"After reading the reviews for Maxi-Hair I decided to give it a try. I am not impressed. They cause stomach upset after eating even a large meal. My nails are splitting and cracking again. The pills are huge. I was comparing Maxi to Phytophanere because I liked and was impressed w/Phyto (smaller capsules,great results for hair & nails), but concerned about one of the ingredients. I tried Maxi for 2 months. Maxi does not work for me and the upset stomach is no longer worth awaiting results."
1,Broke me out HORRIBLY!,"I really wish this product worked for me. After reading some of the rave reviews, I was excited to try it out. I took the pills consistently for two weeks and noticed my cheeks and chin were developing angry cystic acne. I hadn't had acne this bad since before Accutane. I finally decided to stop the pills and now my skin is slowly recovering. I do NOT recommend this product."
2,PRICE NOT RIGHT,"Costco sells a vitamin for HAIR SKIN & NAILS that includes the same vitamins as this one with larger quantities and it's $13.99 for all 250 capsules. Much much cheaper than this one. Unfortunately, i only found that out after purchasing two 90 capsule bottles from here. I feel I was ripped off!I'm rating two stars because of the price, the content of the pill is not enough and the pill is very large and uncomfortable to swallow."
1,Now I know what happened,"My nails were growing so nicely. Thick, long, strong AND FAST!! Every 4 weeks I HAD to cut them because in 4 weeks time, they'd grown back too long after cutting. For some reason since August (I received these and began taking them at the beginning of August) my finger and toe nails have STOPPED growing and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why. My hair -- nothing worth mentioning so I won't mention hair.The only thing I've been doing different since August, because it's now the start of December and STILL, my toe and fingernails have halted in growth, was take these vitamins. MSM seems to work great for many but because it does something crazy with my hair, I can't take it. Instead of taking two pills today I am throwing these out b/c I just found out from reading other reviews that these have MSM in them. I will stop for 3 months and see if there's any change with my nail growth and then come back to update."
2,So Sad,"This product came highly recommeded by my sons girlfriend. She had been using it for several months and her hair has grown and is healthier then ever. I took it because not only does it improve your hair it is suppose to strengthen your nails. Well, its be nine weeks that I have been taking MaxiHair everyday. Guess what! My nails continue so to break and tear. I am so sad that this product did not help my nails. I want nails!!"
4,It's a good suplement,I've bought this product as per my hairdresser advice. My hair was weak and falling out and my nails use to break very easily. I have been taking this for two months and my hair is growing faster and falling much less. Nails are stronger and they grow faster as well. I haven't noticed any skin improvements but overall the product helped me with hair and nails. I do recommend it if you're experiencing hair loss and if your nails are weak and not growing as fast as normal...
1,NO IRON?? SERIOUSLY???,"Iron deficiency is a known cause of hair loss. Especially if you are a woman who loses iron through menstruation, you absolutely should have it in your vitamin. The only reasons not to are if you have been tested by your doctor and have high levels of iron, if you get intolerable stomach discomfort, or uncontrollable constipation.--Gina (M.D. and annoyed customer with female hair loss )"
3,maxi-hair time release tablets,"I really did not want to review this product yet bc its not quite been a mth. since I received it.But I can tell u that the smell will make you gag as soon as u open the jar of pills.If u can stomach the smell as I have been trying to do then it may b just worth it.I can never get 2 pills down however.I do think that my hair is growing better though ,in short I will write another review in a couple weeks to let u know about the growth."
2,Nails keep breaking,"Took this for 3 months, nails were not strengthened but keep tearing high up the nail bed and snagging in clothes. Will be going back to my regular multivitamin that gave me strong, hard nails."
3,Scared!! HELP!,"I heard through the grapevine that this stuff works but once you stop taking them, you hair falls back out. Is it true?? Because I wont buy them then. :-/"
3,It's ok,The pills are friggin HUGE. It says to take 2 of them per day but I only take one. Ive combined it with biotin pills and after taking almost a whole bottle I *think* i'm starting to see results. I won't be purchasing these again...I don't think it did much.
1,No difference,"The first time I tried these vitamins I thought they gave me some baby hairs and stronger shinier nails. This time, I don't notice any difference at all."
2,Not for me,"I'm not saying this is a BAD supplement because I didn't take it long enough to see result. However, after only three days I started getting a bunch of little acne bumps on my cheeks and jawline. I very rarely get acne and I was not getting my ""lady friend"". It also gave me a killer tummy ache - even when taken with food. May work for some people, but just not for me!Namaste"
4,Great!,"Every month I could see a difference in my hair. My hair grows a noticeable amount more and my nails too. I have tried other hair, skin and nail vitamins and don't notice anything. It's not a big difference but it helps :)"
5,Very Effective....,"I first bought this vitamin while on a business trip as I forgot my normal vitamin at home. I will NEVER purchase another vitamin again. I love this vitamin!! I have NEVER, EVER - let me repeat - NEVER, EVER had strong healthy nails. After 6 weeks I had beautifully, strong LONG nails. Completely unbelievable to me. Like any vitamin - you must take them every day and I feel for at least 30 days to start seeing any noticeable results. My hair is much healthier. I've never had any hair issues, but I have noticed that it is healthier and growing much faster than normal. I don't have any skin issues - so I can't offer anything regarding skin.This is a great vitamin and I recommend it whenever I can!!"
3,nothing yet,I'm not sure if this product is really working yet or not. I've only been taking it for about two weeks. I feel like my normally short fuzzy hairs on the front of my head are getting longer and fuller but I'm not sure yet.
1,health hazard,"The product contents may be fine, but the pill size (22mm x 10mm x 8mm) is outrageous. I cut my first pill in half and it got stuck in my throat. After 15 minutes of not being able to either swallow or cough it up, I called 911. The paramedics wanted to take me, to the emergency room but after about another 15 minutes the pill started to dissolve enough to get into my esophagus (saving a $1000 ambulance ride). I had severe indigestion for the next 48 hours, and my throat is still swollen four days later. This product should not be on the market."
1,Horse pills - Too large to swallow Comfortably,"I ended up throwing the whole bottle of pills out. I tried to split the pills, but they ended up in too many pieces. These pills are fine if you're a horse. I can't swallow such huge pills. Thus, the one star. Why can't they make this product in a capsule or at least a smaller pill for people who cannot handle such huge pills?"
3,it's ok,"it worked really well for my nails and skin but I don't see I difference in my hair. But I'm african american and it's always hard for our hair to stay healthy, just gotta live with it"
3,Good Product,"I decided to try this supplement since it got good reviews. This products works, I recently cut my hair short and wanted it to grow back more healthy, Within two weeks my family saw the results! As for the skin and nails I really didn't see any changes, my nails were always in good condition and my skin too! I only took one pill a day because i wanted to make sure it correlates with my body. Before taking any supplement you should consult your doctor and if you have any affects that you never had before then you should stop the use. But, your urine will be like a bright yellow color, which is normal (from the other reviews and research i did). I finished the bottle and i will not be retaking these supplements, I'm trying to do everything natural, so fruit and veggies for me!!"
4,GOOOOOOOD,"the pills are big & they smell, but they are tolerable. the smell is not too bad. over i do see some hair growth results& this is only my second day using these supplemets. i highly recomend.THEY ARE GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTT"
2,"""If it's not broken, don't `fix' it""","They say, ""If it's not broken, don't `fix' it"" and this applies for this ""Improved"" formula. The original worked way better for me. I received tons of thickness and growth with the original, HOWEVER, if you are looking to just thicken your hair, this product will definitely accomplish that for you. Nevertheless, you can get BOTH thicker and longer hair with the original."
1,Be careful thyroid sufferers!,"I took Maxi Hair for 6 weeks and seemed to get favorable results. However, when I went to the doctor for my regular lab blood draw due to my thyroid issue (hypoactive), I was told to immediately cease taking Maxi Hair. This product contains large dosages of protein, which counteracts with the thyroid and the medication. My kidneys have shown a degree of damage in that little amount of time. Be careful thyroid patients!!"
5,Great Product!,"I purchased this product in an attempt to grow my hair longer after I decided to cut it... Well, it has made my hair healthy on top of faster growth! It does look like Mt Dew when you go to the restroom.. But, hey if you have results who cares!"
1,No Results,"Taken religiously for 2 months, I haven't seen any difference in my hair loss or any new growth. I carefully reviewed the other hair vitamins on the market before purchasing, and it seemed that this one got the best and most realistic reviews. I bought enough for 3 months to give it a very fair chance. I didn't expect miracles but did expect to see a noticeable improvement, which I have not.After my supply is finished I am going to try something else in the hopes that continued use of the right hair supplement will eventually provide results."
5,great product,"For years my brush would be full of hair after brushing, so I started looking for regrowth products. They were all over priced. I came across these pills here, the price caught my attention. I really didn't expect it to work at such a low price.I have been using these pills for about a month and my hair is not falling out any more. I highly recommend this product. I am reordering more for my self and for friends and family members.I wanted to update this review, because after only 45 days (1 bottle), I have new hair growth, that is about 1 to 2 inches long. My hair is not as thin as it used to be."
5,Great for hair!,My hair was falling out a lot about 4 months ago. I got worried and started taking these vitamins along with Salmon oil tablets. Fast foward -- my hair is shiny and significantly longer. It doesn't fall out as much (just the normal amounts). My hair always used to grow miserably slow -- no more! My nails are stronger too. I only take one a day and the dosage is still effective!
5,This product works like a charm!,"I've only been using Maxi-Hair for two weeks, but i have already noticed that my hair has gotten longer. It also feels healthier! Im so grateful to have found such a great product. I had a bad experience with a stylist who cut my hair too short and i really missed my long hair. Thankfully, my hair is growing super fast and it should be back to the length it was very quickly. Bottom line, this stuff is awesome and really does work!"
4,Waiting for results,"I just got the pills last week and i'm still waiting to see any results.I already have naturally long nails but they do break easily and my hair is almost near my shoulders (by the way i am African American)...I will write an update in ""April"" letting you guys know how much longer my hair and nails has grown.I'm hoping to get it at least on my back by August.(Please note while taking the pills you have to at least deep condition your hair every 2 weeks to keep it healthy! And stay away from excessive heat ABSOLUTELY no brushes! I noticed using brushes caused my hair to shed more then combs!).Taking the pills plus doing what i have just suggested i have high hopes and faith ill reach my goal =)P.SI gave them 4 stars cause the pills areBIG plus their hard...I had to get use to shallowingthem =("
1,uhm...not so great,I thought I'd try it out since there are such great reviews. I didn't imagine the pills to be so humongous which made it hard for me to swallow...and the smell makes me want to puke. It's also weird that it makes my urine yellow...not sure if that's normal for all vitamins? But this didn't really help my hair loss at all.
2,Ridiculous,"I took the pills according to the directions with no results. I would tell other custmoers to buy them and see how they work or just to use them as a mutlivitamin, but i do not feel that my hair growth has increased at all."
1,Too bad,"The unfortunate thing about combination-vitamins is if one component disagrees with you, you have to toss the whole bottle.This stuff, to put it bluntly, gave me the runs. I'm sure it's just one component since I don't get the runs from regular B-complex, but I don't know which one so I can't go out and get a different product. Grrr. :("
1,No improvement whatsoever,"So 8 days from today would have made it exactly a month since I've been taking Maxi-Hair tablets but I couldn't take it anymore or risk growing more hairs on unwanted places. I was taking women's one-a-day tablets for about three months and decided to try something new. I did not notice any hair growth on my head using the Maxi-Hair but I noticed little peach-like hairs on my sideburns. Also I started to break out on my face and I rarely get pimples...I decided to give this a shot based on some good reviews but after my personal experience with this product I decided not to continue using it. I can not afford a hairy face but doesn't mean this won't work for others. Things I noticed while using these tablets: It makes your urine bright yellow, pills are normal size (women's one-a-day size tablets) and the smell is a little strong, like most tablets, but that didn't bother me. I'm now back to using women's one-a-day as it improved my nails and skin."
2,hair pills,This product did not do all it said it would. I saw no real improvement at all.I will not buy this again.
3,verdict still out,I have been taking these faithfully for two weeks and although I did not expect to see dramatic results immediately I was hoping for some signs of improvement in my hair and still nothing. I will continue to take for the month and see
3,vitamin,"used this for several months, but it just didn't have the minerals I need so I had to supplement it with another vitamin, after a while I just stopped taking this one."
2,Caused breakouts and insomnia,"I wanted to like this product because I read that MSM helps to reduce shedding...And this product contains it. However, this supplement seemed to cause breakouts on my face as well as kept me up at night though I took first thing in the morning. Very disappointing. But it may not have this affect on everyone."
3,"No results noticed so far, 2 months of use.","It might have a small effect on my nails but any regular multivitamin will accomplish that too. I'm going to keep taking it to see if results change but its probably a decent multivitamin if nothing else, don't see any special effects as described though."
4,Definitely increased Hair growth,"I've been growing out my hair for over a year and definitely noticed a difference in texture and pace of hair growth. I have African American texture hair and consistently had a past of shedding. After two months of daily recommended dosage, there was a noticeable difference in that amount of shedding. Definitely purchase. My only grief is with the size of the pills."
3,sole stoppers,they wear down quickly so I need to replace them often... Other than that they're good.
5,Some things the reviewer forgot,"What the reviewer of this article forgot to mention was tha tmany of the songs have been redone; the lumberjack song is a classic, and always look on the bright side of life, has been done by art garfunkel, and recently by jack niclaus in as good as it gets."
5,Quotable for ages,"This CD contains the majority, albeit not all, of Monty Ptyhon's best known songs. Some of them come from the three great Python films - the Holy Grail, the Life of Brian and the Meaning of Life. Others are drawn predominantly from the Flying Circus comdey series. All of them display the absurdist comedy that the Monty Python troup were famous for with the talents of John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Graham Chapman all utilized in various ways. If you are a fan of Monty Python I would highly recommend purchasing this CD so you can appreciate their musical repetoire over and over again."
3,regardezz,"I was really hoping for more ""Norweigan Blue"" and was more than a little surprised at the 5 stars rating. Cute but not of the same laughter rating as some of their other stuff."
3,Get when you can find it!,"This is a very difficult book to find as it is out of print and very rare. I have been looking for it for some years now and just found a few copies posted on Amazon so I have ordered multiple copies. I am giving the book a 3 star because after so long a search, I was disappointed to find the photos lack clarity. This book was written as a resource book to anyone interested in the art and the artist. The photo quality is a poor representation of the amazing talent of the artists presented here but the information is an invaluable addition to any student of Scimshaw."
3,Mysteries of Easter Island Explored,"A good book if your interested in Easter Island. It was not quite as interesting a read as Heyerdahl's ""Kon-Tiki"" however. It tends to focus on the natives currently living on the island more than those who created the statues the island is famous for. But, criticisms aside, Heyerdahl proved again to be a very adept writer."
5,"Great Product, lousy buying options","I love these orthodontic pacifiers - they're the best. And for convenience, it was so nice to be able to purchase them online, as they're difficult to find in some of our frequently-shopped stores. But the fact that you can't request a color is pretty stupid. Our baby is a boy, and we really have no interest in getting red, yellow, pink or purple pacifiers, but requesting specific colors is not allowed. (We were sent 2 yellow and red packs, by the way.) It would be a customer-friendly choice to allow shoppers some individual preferences with these."
2,HORRIBLE RECORDING!!!!,"The dancing was beautiful...although it wasn't all bellydancing like I expected it to be. The thing that really gets me upset is that the recording was terrible and really upsetting that I spent 30 something dollars on this!! As the ladies are dancing on the floor and doing their lovely routines, waiters and customers are walking in front of them and the camera!! So you're watching the dancer and all of a sudden Smith-party-of-twelve walks right in front and across the dance floor!! I cannot believe I wasted my money! DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO...I AM WARNING YOU!!!!"
3,entertainment,"This is an entertainment video and includes a large number styles from various countries and skill levels. This was filmed in a restaurant as people are being served and the waiters and customers passing in front of the camera and on the dance floor is annoying but can be ignored. This is a good revue of styles, countries and costumes.The camera is a bit far away for my tastes. I do not think it was worth the price however."
1,a night at the casablanca,"this was a total waste of money....the entire 80 minutes of this vide was a home recording from some restaurant. It was horrible. Do not buy this tape. If there was a lower rating I would have given it a negative 15. the quality of the picture was horrid, it was not proffessional looking at all."
4,My first video,"Hello, I just want to say that this is my first video about bellydancing. You know, in Czech Republic there isn't a big choice of some videos, music records, costumes and accessories for bellydancing and so I'm really happy that I've find this record. It helps me a lot !!! Now, I can see some new sorts of dance and I like it so much. Especially Eva, she is great... I hope that in the future, I'll be a real bellydancer and this video gives me a motivation and shows me how to do it..."
5,A very informative book,This book is great for those just starting with Maya as well as those who have a little more experience in it. The book is broken down into projects that use the different components of Maya. Advanced users might not find this book too useful but beginners to intermediate users will find that this book is a real asset. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get into Maya.
2,frustrating indeed,"I agree with the first review, this book gets frustrating. I am a student and am still learning how to use Maya and I find in this book that it sort of tells you what to do rather than tell you what your doing. Also, lose the pronouns; every now and then the book starts explaining something and it can be hard to know what it's talking about because it expects you to know certain things you have already done. It does teach you the basic principles and techniques though, but you will probably have to read through a few times to fully understand it. I haven't read any of the other books, but i suggest to keep looking before deciding on this one."
3,An okay book,"I really looked forward to this book because of the reviews I read on it. I originally purchased the Maya 5 Fundamentals and to be honest, beside the boring DVD that accompanies the book, I like the Maya 5 Fundamentals book better. Admittedly the Maya 5 Foundation book got me a little further but the tutorial lessons have no personality. Just follow these steps to achieve this. No real explaination on why."
4,The best help so far,"This book is the best 3d tutorial book I have read yet. I am new to 3D and have tried 6 other books aimed at beginners. This book is so far the best in getting me to feel confident in using Maya. There are a few areas that I'm sure have not been updated as the software has changed, ie there are seemingly steps missing and a couple of things aren't exactly as they say to do it. Though the beauty of Maya is there are so many ways to go about doing something in Maya, and this book reinforces that, each project will show you how to go about to do similar operations in Maya, but each time will show you a different way to go about it in the software.They best sorce of help for beginning Maya."
4,Good and Bad,".I thought it was a good book. Most of it was simple, and any idiot could do it.BUT there were some steps that were simply missed out that caused problems later in the lession, they were a pain to fix.Never the less they could have done some things better but most of it was good.It was worth buying."
1,Worst Book EVER!,"The book tries to work from a step-by-step process. BUT, the authors don't tell you where some of the buttons or menus are. Even after learning Maya I went back to the book expecting the tutorials be easier, but no. PLUS, they miss some steps that are vital.P.S. Do Not go to Sam Houston State University for their Art program! Waste of Money."
2,Not for beginner,"It doesn't explain much. If you are a beginner of Maya, you will be confused and frustrated by it."
4,'The Way Things Ought to Be' for the gun crowd,"When I got this book, I expected no less than a ranting, raving stream-of-consciousness type of book. I was right, in a way. When Ted gets passionate, it can get pretty wild, but in a good portion of this book you get to see the more spiritual and philosophical side of Ted. He discusses the ethics, and morality of hunting, and illustrates his points quite well. I look forward to Ted's next book!"
5,Uncle Ted is right on target,"The most powerful and truthful books I've read in a long time. As a Second Amendment advocate myself. I found a very strong and powerful message within this book. You know the feeling that you get when you stand and say the pledge allegiance? That same feeling I experienced several times when reading this book. Ted Nugent is a master in the second amendment, hunting sports and Rock 'N Roll. And you can add master writer to that list. I very much enjoyed his honesty and how outspoken he is about drugs and alcohol. As a member of the NRA. I am glad that Ted Nugent is on the board of directors. Uncle Ted god bless you and your family.Mark Vanderberg is the Founder of Michiana Second Amendment Advocates South Bend, Indiana"
4,uncle ted,"I like the book a lot....we have the same views, so I'd recommend this book; however, I did have to take a few breaks in it and read other books...."
5,Great book.,Uncle Ted is hilarious in this book. I consider it a must read if you're into that sorta thing. Lot's of great stories. Very inspiring book. Do yourself a favor and buy two of em.
3,Mr. Nugent is more qualified to be President than Obama!,"Great Book! What an insight to the Motor City Mad Man's life. Mr. Nugent has done more to help this great country than Obama will ever be capable. Mr. Nugent's impressive resume of leadership should be the example used for new Junior Senators. His tireless commitment to the exposure of deadhead politicians has helped more people recognize the truth about the lies that degrade the basic foundation of America. Mr. Nugent is a ""Get Off Your duff and get it done, don't wait for someone else to do it for you"" Kind of American. He is not a Politician he is an American! If you don't see the need for America to return to the foundation in which it was created, please move your overheated carcass to Europe. Don't make this Great Country into another euro liberal stench pot."
1,An inhuman monster,"What a disgust this man is. How dare Ted Nugent, call himself an environmentalist and conservationist and yet enjoy killing so much. Hunting is one thing, but to actually enjoy watching animals suffer and die as this scumbag does, manifests to me an inhuman monster with a gun. A disgrce to the human race."
2,Ted named this book incorrectly....,"...it should be titled GUNS GUNS GUNS GUNS GUNS GUNS GUNS by Ted Nugent. I guess I had the wrong idea about this. I was hoping for more rock n' roll stories, but they were few and far between. It's not that I'm anti-hunting, or that his self-rightous attitude offends me (it doesn't), but I was really looking for something that talked about his rock experience, his guitar playing, or something other than guns. Look for me to be ""regifting"" this book at Christmas time..."
1,What is WRONG with you people?,"Anyone who buys into Nugent's ""patriot"" hype is somehow totally misinformed. He was a well-known draft dodger back in the Vietnam era. All of his flag-waving is nothing but a publicity stunt. As for his big talk about values, he has the morals of an alleycat.Why is it that the radical right-wing these days has to promote chickenhawks and hypocrites as their spokesmen?Why do so many otherwise fully functioning, well-meaning Americans buy into their bull?If you want to promote this clown's masquerade as an uberpatriot, then buy this book. If you're truly concerned about the future of our country, then speak out against these merchants of intolerance. America works best when we work together. These guys who try to turn us against one another are doing a lot more harm than good. They appeal to your base emotions, without providing any solutions. Don't be sucked in."
2,"Guns, Guns & Guns","I'm a big fan of Ted the man and Ted the musician. But contrary to the title, this book has very little in it about God or rock 'n' roll. Leaving -- you guessed it -- guns, guns and guns. That's 300-plus pages of Ted hunting, Ted's kids hunting, Ted's favorite guns, Ted's views on guns, Ted's views on hunting, Ted's hunting friends, Ted and the NRA .... While I actually agree with most of what Ted has to say, I would like to point out that as a musician he should know the danger of playing the same note over and over."
4,An entertaining book,"Even if you don't agree with Ted, this book is an interesting read. I can certainly appreciate his bold and outspoken interpretation of social issues. Nugent does not shy away from child raising, gun control, welfare, and other issues. I think many of the reviews of this book are based upon Ted's personality and reputation. Give the book a chance - I bet you won't be able to put it down. I laughed out loud several times and thought his lack of ""political correctness"" was refreshing."
2,"Guns, Guns and Guns","The book is about 5 percent God, 15 percent Rock n Roll and 80 percent guns. It was interesting enough that I finished it, but it wasn't a great read.The only reason I keep it is because Terrible Ted signed the front cover for me."
2,About 5 Chapters too long...,"OK, Ted, we get the point. Hunting is good, guns are good. The themes of this books are repeated to the point that, even if you agree with him, you want him to say something else. He brings up some interesting points, but not enough to stretch into an entire book. This would have made a much better essay."
2,Disappointing,"Big disappointment. I'm a huge Ted Head and looked forward to the release of this book. However, all Nugent talks about is blowing away wild life in the back woods of Michigan. I've got nothing against hunting but you'd think he talk a little about his 50 or so years of playing rock music! I think he has like 3 sentences in the whole book where he speaks about recording a song/ album. I truly wonder how many people bought this book only to be let down by his ... hunting stories. Even if Ted focused on politics it would have been more interesting."
1,Disappointing,"I've grown up in the shadow of Uncle Ted. I'm almost 50 and when I was about 20 I remember reading about his draft dodge story when he was being interviewed by some magazine. Don't remember which one.I've seen him in concert a couple of times and must say he puts on a great show and no one can put more of themselves into a concert than him. That's who he is to me. A brillant rocker. He has walked through rock and roll history. That's what I wanted to hear about. I was really embarrassed for him. I love guns, hunting and right to carry but what does that have to do with what he has given his fans for over 30 years. He lives a stones throw from my house now. If I met him on the street I'm not sure I would know what to say to him. He's a great man. It's just a sadly boring irrelevant book.I really hope he gets a good ghost writer and tells of all the amazing things he's experianced in his life."
1,Please Ted!,"Nugent is great showman and entertaining guest on talk shows. But this book is plane tedious! Here is the entire ""plot"":He knows everything and then some. His wife=lovely. Dad=Great.His Children= wonderful.Plenty of gun details, reads like a gun users manual.Killing deer, while they drink at the waterhole, is super. He prays for them, after he snipes them off.He knows important people.He is a hero in his self righteous world.Guns are super, repeat the mantra.No other point, no entertainment value."
3,RPG,"An X-Men adventure, tying into the happenings of the Days of Future Past scenario.Given that this is one of the best X-Men stories ever, this makesthis a really good adventure. Want to get chased by giant robotkillers? Here is your chance to open up a can of Sentinel whuparse onyourself, and on others."
4,"Excellent ""Campaign"" Very free roaming","This set of rules is incredible I have used it many times. It presents a world where the characters have full control. There is no set story, but the book helps to setup different ideas in the GM's head. A must have for anyone who's tired of the same old boring campaigns but likes to have a nice set of rules to work with."
3,.,"The story is very realistic - two friends have a stupid, pointless squabble and make up when they've calmed down. It's told in a very easy, simple (not too preachy) way.I'm not a fan of the artwork, though. The style and the colors chosen make the whole thing look muddy and drab to me, and not particularly engaging."
4,Still Pitching,"I enjoyed this book very much. I barely put it down this weekend. It was kind of strange for me as I relived my own dark high school years. The way the book is written it felt like I had opened up a time capsule and was forced to look at everything in excruciating detail. It held my attention so I couldn't look away even when I wanted to. The things I wanted to forget like my own desire to be with the cool group and the humiliation that inevitably occured was expressed in a way I'd never read before. I remember walking down the hall when one of the most popular guys passed me with a friend and barked at me. Man, did I hate high school. I never looked back until reading this book - which is so honest. I was impressed that the author had the guts to say what many teenagers feel but would never say aloud. For me, it was less about baseball and more about how to survive high school if you're not ""in"" with the ""in"" group."
5,"An entertaining, and occasionally inspiring recollection","Still Pitching: A Memoir is the autobiography of Michael Steinberg, a successful writer who has had an especial love for the game of baseball ever since his high school years. From how the game transformed Michael from an introvert into a popular pitcher during his high school years, to how the game helped him grow into the confidence needed to pursue his writing career, Still Pitching is a positive, entertaining, and occasionally inspiring recollection guaranteed to resonate with fellow baseball fans."
1,Pride Is A Sin,"A pretty good plot with lots of potential as a comedyand it is marketed as a comedy,but it is not actually a comedy.It is a tragedy with comedic moments.It is a story of very damaged and unhappy peoplewhose lives are ruined by obsession and loneliness.Much of what passes as humor is the worst sort of toilet humor and mean spirited.The upside is that, for the Bostonian,there are excellent locations, flavor and customs that many will recognize.The film-makers did their research.This could have been a great comedy, but it fails.I cannot recommend it for any reason."
2,Very Few Funny Parts,This movie has a few funny parts to it but the rest of the jokes make for rather dull moments and they will only garner a chuckle if your a 30+ year old couch potato who likes to watch sports all day and is one of those die hard fans pictured in this film. I was expecting to see something better because it had one of the Wayans Brothers in it but I was disappointed.
3,Writing and Reporting News,Helps understand the fundamentals of writing and reporting in a real live situation. An extreme help for beginner journalists or writers.
5,Good erotic non XXX movie!,"I watched this movie today with my girlfriend, and we had sex twice during the movie! Good sign! It means that it was very appealing to both of us, there are few movies that really turn us on (toghether), this is one! There are no actual XXX scenes but the movie is very well made and we didn't miss the XXX action (which we usually do miss in an erotic movie). The story is good, the actresses and the actor very attractive, the sex scenes turned in a very intense way, the acting is really good (apart from some supporting actresses, but who cares?), not to much pubic & other hair (being the 70's), I highly recommend it!The only thing that bothered us was the ""shhhhh"" backroung noise, but you can live with it, just keep the TV remote handy to adjust the volume..."
4,Hot classic sexy movie,"Wow, this is one of the best Joe Sarno's directed sexy erotic films ever made with Rebecca Brooke, Eric Edwards and Cathja Graff! Rebecca and Cathja did a hot scene together!"
1,"Burke's General Armory (The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland & Wales: Comprising a Registry of Amoral Bearings from",Originally published in 1878 the 1996 facsimile reprint in paper back was authoritative with lots of good information about coats of arms etc. and with descriptions of individual family coats of arms from Abadam up to Fitz-Otis. I was much disappointed that the rest of the alphabet of names was not there. That this was only a partial edition was not mentioned in any of the information provided by Amazon or the publisher.How do I get the missing volume(s) of this publication? What I received I would rate five stars but much was missing and therefore I cannot give it a rating.
5,superbly photographed,"A very moving and beautiful book. Not only were the transvestite and drag queen photographs very well done, but also boldly done as well were the male-to-female transsexual photographs. Even taken with full frontal nudity, the pictures were very tasteful and classy showing the variance of the transsexual woman's body regardless of whether gender-reassignment surgery would be performed. A great book for my personal home library indeed. I truly loved it."
1,don't make the same mistake I did,"Okay. I admit it: I bought this for ""Teen Angst (What the World Needs Now)."" I still really like the song, but apparently they used up all of their creative lyric-writing abilities on that song because the rest of the album is unimaginitive, dime-a-dozen, waste-of-space, early 90s filler songs. I'm just glad I got this used and didn't pay full price for it. Blech."
5,Good Times,"I was humming a tune I had not heard in years and noticed that the only line I knew was, ""I don't know what the world may need..."". I knew that I had to track the song down and I'm glad I did because I had almost forgotten how much I like listening to bands like Cracker. Thanks for sending this disc so quickly."
2,"Cute, but that's all...",This bag is really cute but it's way too small for all the things I need to lug around for baby. It's okay for quick trips places but not for a long outing. The two pockets on the inside of the bag are too small to really be useful for anything and it's just hard to keep things organized in this bag. I'm searching for something else.
1,Good looking but many flaws,"Good points: very stylish, husband can take it without feeling too ""girly""; goes along with the awesome spirograph set; has enough storage space for day trips.Bad points: smells terrible!! The strange material on the oustide of the bag feels like a soft-seatbelt and smells like a tent!; The bag is hand-wash only...when you have a baby when do you have time to hand-wash anything?; the seams come apart very easily on the inside lining and pockets.I was stuck with this bag and had to wash it literally 8 times to get the smell under control. Of course it's not meant to be washed like that, and about 50% of the seams inside came apart, and the material on the outside has some damage (think how satin picks). However after repairing it, I continue to use it and am mostly happy with it. I would think that the other ""spirograph"" bags may be more dourable, and may not smell- maybe worth a try."
3,good,This is a good diaper bag. It is a nice big size and extremely easy to wipe off if you get something on it.
3,Nice but too small and quality is average,"It is a nice bag but it all depends on what you are looking for - the design looks good but it doesn't seem to be very solid nor has enough space. Due to the price though, I think it is a good bag, better than most of the ones out there.Although I am not sure how long it can last.It didn't work for me as it is not what I was looking for, I tried but ended up returning it to get something more expensive but bigger and better quality."
1,Cord too short,The cord is only 3' long and is too short to be used unless you are right on top of your computer.Don't be so cheap Coby!
4,Enjoyed it,"My daughter-in-law had a baby recently and had never seen the movie ""Look Who's Talking"". We enjoyed watching this movie one night together. Definitely not academy award winning, but entertaining and fun just the same."
5,nice family movie,I received this movie way before in expected it to arive. The movie had no defects to it. This is not the only movie that I have ordered here and I will definatly continue to do so as long as they keep up the awsomeLook Who's Talking/Look Who's Talking Too
4,Excellent,"If you're a beginner at having a pond and keeping koi, this is a great book. It has everything from digging the pond, filters and pumps...to everything you need to know to keep the pond clean for your fish. The book identifys the various breeds of koi, with a complete section on diseases."
4,good for beginners or those ....,who have koi. Good section on dieseases and descriptions on the different color paterns of the various classes of koi. A must for the beginner or someone doing a school project or for those just thinking about adding a pond and koi to their property.
3,Ok,"Where's the part about behavior, the part about training your fish to come on over (admittedly this is easy) and how about a more comprehensive types and markings - it was also sad they really skipped over butterfly koi. Otherwise nice pictures and a good disease section.Oh well. Nice book to have, but it is not by any means complete."
3,Koi Keeping Guild,I found this book to be out of date in the keeping of Koi in today's world. It is basicly useful to but of limited value.
3,lid of sugar bowl is warped:,We are replacing old tableware with corelle abundance. We have ordered several items and will order a few more today. The sugar bowl lid is warped and does not come close to covering the sugar. It appears the lid was cooled from hot on a crooked surface. We do not like this poor quality item.
5,Corelle Coordinates Abundance Sugar and Creamer Set,"Oh So pretty, these fit my decor just perfect. Well made with the Corelle family of products."
4,A Great Reference,"One of the 2 books I find necessary for repairs. Occasionally, the pictures are different from metal reality, but you can figure it out. It's usually very accurate and always invaluable. Anyone working on cars needs both Haynes and Chilton manuals."
3,Mechanically challenged? Take it to a shop.,"I'm mechanically challenged and bought this to figure things out, and try to save some money. It really didn't help, my suggestion is unless someone is going to go over it with you and teach you out of the book, just take your car in for regular service and you'll be fine."
3,This book is very commerical and unimaginative,"SHADOWS is a fairly well-written book and I'm sure it was difficult to write, considering the narrow framework (meaning no plot revelations or allowance of character growth) within which the author had to work. I didn't like Dash Rendar; a totally unoriginal Han ""fill-in,"" and Prince Xizor proved a disappointment because, for all the hype about how powerful he is during the first half of the book, he is proved to be inept and quite easily battled later on. SHADOWS is a clever book and did have its moments, but after reading I felt this book was at best a commercial ""probe"" to see if the SW franchise could expand its character base...to sell more toys."
5,It describes the story very well,"Before I read this book I had very small knowledge on the Shadows Of The Empire story. After reading this book I knew exactly what the story was, when the story was, and all that good stuff."
4,May the force be with you...Geek.,"With the rerelease of the Star Wars movies, and the awsome N64 game, I had to read this book. Only Star Wars fans would enjoy this book."
4,One part missing,"I've read the novel and love it.This Illustrates the novel quite well. It's wonderful to actually see Prince Xizor, Guri, Vader's dueling droids, Xizor's skyhook and the whole story unfold.Only have one complaint about the graphic novel. In the novel there is a duel between Luke and Guri, that's one of my favorite parts of the Novel, and it's missing in the graphic novel. It's absence is why this didn't get 5 stars."
3,Not too bad,"As with so much of Star Wars, you pretty much have to read the book it ties into to get it all. The effort on LucasFilm's part was overall admirable, although the problem remains when you have large numbersof people who don't read both genres of comic book and novel.The highlights here are the scenes with Boba Fett and the bounty hunters. The main character material seems almost as filler tie-ins and even the art seems to lax a bit in those categories.The pencils are good for the most part, while the coloring tends to vary. I've not too fond of Cary Porter's coloring, as it tends to be unrealisting and not dramatic at times. Once again, these flaws tend to be more visible in the 'main-character' plotline.Buy it if you want some nice Bounty Hunter interaction and the like."
3,Above-Average,"A decent graphic novel. Has pretty good art, the storyline was ok, but what really ruined this for me was the unrealistic-ness. If you thought Empire vol. 1: Betrayal had cheesy dialogue by Vader, you'd hate this. Vader also seemed to be acting like a disobient 2 year old, never listening to anyone. What I also found annoying was the fact that the characters all seemed to be constantly talking to themselves. Boba Fett isn't his usual quiet, calculated self in this book. He was always taunting others and talking to himself as he tried to escape what seemed like an entire galaxy chasing him. Possibly the only cool characters in this were Luke and Dash Rendar. I've definitely read better."
2,Unrepentant revisionist`s version of the Cold War,"Walter LaFeber is a product of the Wisconsin University`s radical left history department. The uninitiated should read John E. Hayes'""In Denial"". Despite evidence to the contrary, LaFeber foists the guilt of the origins of the Cold War upon the United State`s ""imperialism"" and minimizes Stalin`s complicity. There are many more unbiased books available on this to read."
4,Another great book from a great author,"I have to first say that I love Patricia Scanlan. I have been a fan since I first read City Girls a few years ago and I have read everything she has published since then. I love her work and her stories always hook me in immediately. This book was no different.From reading the book jacket, you would think that this is your average, run of the mill, divorce story. Bitterness, fights, heatrbeak and trauma. But its much more than that. I think this story was oddly uplifting. A dependent woman learns to stand on her own two feet. She suffers a terrible tragedy but learns that she make something of herself. This is her chance to become the type of woman she always admired. There is lots of drama and heartbreak along the way, making this an inticing read. I definitly recommend it anyone, not just fans of Maeve Binchy. I think that Patricia Scanlan is in a category all her own!"
4,Coming into her own,"Francesca has always been the perfect mother and corporate wife, deferring to the males in her family in all things. Imagine her shock and surprise, when she discovers that her husband Mark is having an affair with a woman in his office. This book chronicles the various stages her emotions go through as a result of the affair--sadness, anger, and depression--before she decides that it's time to get on with her life. Scanlon's characters are wonderful--the selfish husband, the triumphant mistress, the concerned sons, the interfering mother--and the situations are funny without being over the top. She shows various incidents from different points of view which make them even more interesting. The transformation of the mousy Francesca to a woman of substance will have readers cheering."
3,Really more a 3 and half.,I liked this book and began to read her others. The only reason I didn't give it higher was because Francesca kind of got on my nerves in the beginning. I think we should have had more about her life afterwards. She moped just a bit too long but the ending was so satisfying that I forgave the moping.
2,Miles from Maeve Binchy!,"I purchased several of Patricia Scanlan's titles, including Francesca's Party and was disappointed. Maeve Binchy and Cathy Kelly are so superior in plot, characters, and sense of place - their stories come alive. This would be an adequate plane or beach book but don't expect Ireland's best!"
4,toy,The toy itself was great. The metal can it came it was crushed during shipping. It was not well received when it was given as present after that. It took a bit of talking to get the child to build the lego figure. The figure was not crushed and all the pieces fit perfectly and were easy to assemble.
2,A bit simplistic for all but the most uninformed patient,We were a bit disappointed with the simplistic descriptions and rough illustrations. I think next time they should hire a real medical illustrator. We found more helpful information and descriptions by simply searching on WebMD. Sorry!
3,"Love This Skillet, but does not meet Description.","This skillet is great compared to the crappy skillets I replaced with it. I love the non-stick surface and how my food cooks evenly. Cleaning the skillet is a breeze even if left in the sink overnight. However, unlike the product description, the handle DOES NOT stay cool when cooking on the stove top and I found out the hard way...ouch! Always keep some oven mitts nearby when handling this skillet."
1,CAUTION: read before ordering,"I just received my skillet which seemed well recommended by other purchasers. I could not believe how poorly it worked! As if there were no non-stick surface whatsoever. Really, it is absolutely the worst 'non-stick' surface I've ever encountered. This pan is going back and soon. I don't know how to account for the other favorable reviews. This pan is awful."
3,pretty good korean mystery,"This movie certainly had me wondering all of the way.It starts off with some gruesome murders and we are talking some truly sickening stuff here. We find out the murders look to be done by a copycat. The murderer who is being copied is in jail so the cops go and speak with him. These were by far my favorite parts of the movie. This kid who plays the serial killer is very good.I have to say that the movie was very well acted and they did a good job telling the story, it was just a little boring."
2,Imitative and exploitative,"A pair of emotionally damaged police detectives (Jung-ah Yum and Jin-hee Ji) investigate a series of gruesome killings that emulate the murders of a serial killer (Seung-woo Cho) who was imprisoned ten months earlier. They suspect that he has an accomplice on the outside. In a sense, they are correct. The truth provides a nice twist that would have had more impact if it had not been imbedded in a plot that has so many lapses in logic. Unprofessional behavior makes it difficult to take these cops seriously. They seem to make some pretty big intuitive leaps and there are plot elements that don't connect very well to the main story, although both of these could be the fault of poor subtitling. The final moments of the film are intended to shock, but they require one character to behave in a way that contradicts what we have seen of her before, so it comes off as cheap exploitation."
4,One of the best shows ever and I got it right away.,I was looking through the Amazon store to purchase the remaining seasons and found that the market has gone crazy by how many the regular box sets cost. One of the seasons that came in the original dvd box now costs close to a $100 bucks! I had the option of buy this one for less than $5 dollars or the original dvd box for $55 bucks. There is no reason for such a large difference.This dvd set is just a flimsy plastic cover that has a divider inside that holds all the dvds together. There was no damage to the box or dvds since I ordered it as new. I ordered this item on a wednesday and got it in the mail by the weekend which was amazing since I didn't add on any special delivery options. I'm glad I got it in the condition I wanted and right away.Hopefully the prices for the original box sets go down because I was hoping to collect them.
5,THIS IS A MUST SEE,"This documental is one of the best i have seen, it really makes you think about the way human beings behave and how the awareness of death changes our behavior, GREAT DOCUMENTAL, DEFENETLY A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE WHO THINKS SOMETIMES ABOUT DEATH."
3,list price is too high,"The list price is $46, and $12 discount. Sounds like you get a good deal with just $34. But H2O official website list price is $34 too... I don't know where the $46 is coming from. The lotion itself is good, I have been using it for 2 years."
4,Very nice moisturizer,"This product saved my face from winter's flaky skin. I don't believe it diminishes fine lines, but nothing really does. I do agree it can be a bit sticky if you put too much on. You need to wait about 10-15 minutes after applying to put on your foundation or it won't go on well. After trying many other products, I would recommend this one!"
2,"Filed under ""you get what you pay for""","These truffles had no flavor. I don't know if it's the way they were stored or what, but they added nothing to my dishes."
1,Don't waste your time,"Nearly tasteless... there is a faint bit of musky saltiness, but no real flavor. The same amount of money will buy enough truffle oil to flavor a dozen dishes.At least the jar is cute!"
5,A must read...,"If you are an avid Sci-Fi reader and especially look forward to aliens and adventure, then you need this book, and all of the other Chanur books."
3,"Again, Great Writing, But No Ending","This is the sequel to ""Chanur's Venture."" It continues where that book leaves off. Unfortunately, like that book, this one doesn't end properly. The ending here is slightly more reasonable than what the publisher did with ""Chanur's Venture,"" but if you read this book, you'd better have a copy of ""Chanur's Homecoming"" (the sequel) handy. As with the prior Chanur books, this one is excellently written. However, this one does go on a bit too much with everything possible going wrong at the worst possible time. After about 170 pages of that in ""Chanur's Venture,"" the additional 270 pages here gets exhausting. If the book had ended at a more reasonable point, I'd have given it four stars."
3,Nice price,Price was nice. Case was broken but I believe that was stated on description. CD itself played well. Received item in a few days
4,Fascinating account. Is it real? Is it true?,"This will bring out the skeptic in most readers. It can be a stretch to believe and will push your buttons if you don't buy into past-life regression, guides, facilitated communication. It is a wonderful account of a young girl's life, and her mother's constant participation/direction in her life (maybe to the extreme?). And raises questions not only about autism but other forms of physical difficulties (stroke victims, spinal injuries) where the body is not in tact, communication is difficult or impossible, but the mind is functioning beautifully. How frustrating to be trapped inside of that body. It is a story of hope and inspiration. I didn't want to put it down."
5,Adri really opened up my heart ! I thank her for that,This book was so ineresting that I could not put it down. I want to know more about Adri cause her and I are the same age as I am reading this book I feel every moved by her. I want to give Adri my deepest thanks...
1,Only die-hard New Age fans will enjoy...,"Kristin Jorde believes her autistic daughter Adriana is the reincarnate John the Apostle, and that she herself is the Soldier who got an ear chopped off by Peter when Judas betrayed Christ... she also believes in a previous life, she was married to her daughter (Kristin was the husband.) Umm, Adriana was also cursed by Cleopatra in a former life...Bottom line: if this doesn't float your boat, you won't enjoy the book."
5,A Child of Eternity,Found this true story to be so enlightening.........Learned so much. You will fall in love with this family. I honor the mom for writing and sharing their journey. Great read!!!!!!!!!
4,Cat`s Eye View,"Told from a cat`s point of view, this is a the tale of Maggie, a determined and faithful friend, who is on the trail of a moving van in search of her best buddy. He had fallen asleep in a chest of drawers and was unknowingly carried off by the movers. No awards, but the protagonist is female and it is a pleasant story."
1,Not for use in America.,I coud not get to see the VCR. I sent it back to get one that would work in the USA. Still waiting.
4,More Light output than the Techno Strobe RGB.,"I have used two of these and they are very bright, the colors are very intense and is worth the price. The give a good light show and are portable enough to carry, 4 at a time. I also own the Techno strobe RBG by Chauvet which is much smaller unit, however it has better light show than these Colorpallete and that is pretty much the only reason why I was disappointed. Other than that they are great working in pairs and are perfect for those ""no fog allowed"" events which are about %75 percent of the events I do indoors."
5,This is a classic album.,Vicente Fernandez interprets the songs on this album with passion and sincerity. The orchestrations are incredible and the lyrics are straight from the heart. This album has a somber feel. The songs on this album remind me of the melancholic boleros sung by Javier Solis and the blues-like rancheras sung by Los Alegres de Teran. This is a must album for enthusiasts of Mexican folkloric music.
5,Perfect Replacement,"This seat post was purchased to replace the stock one (junk) that came on my otherwise kinda nice Motobecane Cafe Latte. I had already replaced the seat and noticed that the seat post seat clamp was as wide as the new seat, if not a hair wider! It chafed, so I ordered this seat post and it is just what the Doctor ordered! :) Works perfectly...just what I needed! Looks nice too. I highly recommend this seat post."
4,Definitely holds your attention,"Like the previous reviewer, I don't usually read this genre of books, but the story was to interesting to pass up. A'cire paints a picture so vivid that you can actually see, in you mind of course, the interactions between the characters. A great read for lovers of this genre and those whom, like me, tend to read adventure and conspiracy novels."
1,IS HE A PASTOR OR WHAT?,"THIS BOOK WAS OKAY, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WAIT TO BRING THE DAUGHTER INTO THE BOOK IN THE END? THE BEST PAGE IN THE BOOK WAS 160 AND I COULD UNDERSTAND THIS PAGE.HE KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING,AND HE USE ELISE,HE WAS NOTHING BUT A DOG AND NEEDED TO GET A JOB."
5,OishiI!,Great traditional spice for everyday use in home Japanese cooking. Adds a lot of flavor and a little spice to any dish - certainly a necessity if you are thinking of making traditional Japanese dishes at home!
5,This stuff is DELISH.,"I mix this with sugar and sea salt, toss some potatoes in olive oil, and make great baked fries with this stuff. Such a unique flavor, and everyone in my house likes it- even the picky eaters. I love this stuff."
3,Slow Shipment,I received this book past the date that I needed it for a neurology class. The quality seems fine.
4,Loved the text but didn't get to color,"The panes of information were an excellent complement to my neuroanatomy instruction. However, anyone in medical school can attest to the fact that time is of the essence. As I look through my book, I notice that I only had time to color in 14 pictures (some weren't complete). Many of my classmates fared worse as they purchased ""Neuroanatomy Primer: Color to Learn"" and used it even less. If you struggle with anatomy, this will definetly help! If you do well with structures and locations, then you probably won't take the time to utilize this tool."
4,The Human Brain coloring book,"If you are a visual learner, this coloring book is a must for Neuroanatomy class!"
4,"It is good, but lacked some info I needed","This is a good book, but lacked some of the intermediate info I needed. I looked at getting a brain model, but could not find a good one for a decent price."
5,much better then I expected,Amazing set of remixes and Linda's powerful voice. The voice and lyrics fits the music perfectly. Track 6 on the CD is the best mix even if it is kind of a dub with almost no vocals. The other mixes are ok. The Boris & Beck mixes are kinda boring and not very good. Buy it and you will be happy you did. Well worth the money and time to get.
2,Double Burner Griddle,I have had this griddle about a month. The griddle does not clean up very well even though I always use olive oil. But the biggest problem is it warped after using it in a 200 degree oven. Otherwise the size is fine and the rubber handles are great for preventing burns. Other farberware pans I have are OK.
1,stuck to glass cooktop,"Very disappointed after one use. All was going well, not warping, etc...until I took it off the stove. Some of the finish came off. I bought it at Sears and hopefully I can return it."
1,Mistake Buying This,I bought this to attach to a safety gate I already had. I needed to put something up so that my dogs could not lick my daughter (or vice versa). My safety gate is 7' X 2'. Do NOT buy this if the area you are trying to cover is smaller than the net. It's pointless and it looks horrible. I am worried my baby would fall in and get caught in the excess netting.
1,Returned it before wasting my time,"Once we took this net out of the box I knew it wouldn't work. Our balcony railing was not only longer, but shorter in height, than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing. The ""strings"" used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous. I am searching for an alternative."
2,Unsightly unless your opening is exactly the same dimensions,"I bought several of these for a deck rail. The deck rail was 2'x 8' openings between the main support rails. We attempted to configure it in every manner possible and just could not get it to look any less that tacky. We broke down, took off the net and reconstructed the rail on our whole deck. Not an ideal fix-all like it proclaims. Wasted my time and money on this net, when we could have been spending the time getting it reconstructed rather than playing with hundreds of eye screws, nylon ropes and attempting to make it look better."
3,Difficult to install and High maintenance,"There isn't much of a choice out there, so I have no products to compare this to, but I don't care for this item much. I had to install loop type screws into the finished wood base of my railing to secure it at the bottom (otherwise the netting can be slid up on the rails) and on my wall and the nylon ties that come with it are always slipping loose. If your child pulls on the netting, it comes loose very quickly, no matter how many knots you tie in the darn things. I hate having all those holes in my wood and wall, but I guess I have no other choice if I'm going to keep my kids safe. I could have screwed them into the floor where the carpet meets the bannister base, but then they would be in the way when vacumming. It would be nice if they could come up with something less permanent and destructive for indoor railings."
2,Its OK,"I have a very petite 13 month old and my house is a bit older, the spindles on my bannister are too far apart and she could easily fall through them. I needed something so I thought I would try this. There is no way to secure this tightly to the bottom of the spindles on the railing. Because the fabric is so flexible and the rope ties are too my daughter at 13mo old figured out in 2 min that she can just slide the fabric up the spindles. The clear plastic sheeting is far superior (and 3 times the price). I have the clear plastic sheeting up now and it is much safer."
1,Not at all what I was expecting,I bought this item for my stair railing to protect my 1 year old from the wide spaces in between the rails. I was disappointed when I received the net. It is flimsy and would not protect my curious 1 year old boy who might accidently or purposefully push or lean against it. I was would not recommend this item to be used on an upstairs banister.
4,Worked like a charm!,"My husband and I were having a hard time figuring out how to keep our daughter safely in her bed at night in our camper. We tried bedrails and gates and both failed for multiple reasons. We finally decided to look for some sort of mesh to pull across the 6ft opening. After an extensive surf on the web, we came across Railnet. We attached it to two tension rods (rolling the excess) and it worked fantastic. As for it's intended use, we wouldn't know. Hope any campers out there found this helpful."
1,Smelled Toxic!,I received this product and upon taking it out of it's packaging was overwhelmed by the smell of chemicals on it. It smelled like someone had drowned the two of them in bug spray (like as in raid for wasps type bug spray). We let it air out for a few days but nothing helped. In the end we disposed of them. Just horrible!!!! I wouldnt let me child anywhere near these.
4,Loft safe,I have a loft ver looking the family room & this safety net works great. It does move but you can secure it with more ties if need be.
3,It looks awful,I hate to be vain but this looks awful. It does serve it's purpose of keeping my baby from falling down the stairs which is most important. I am counting down the days until I can get rid of it though.
4,Does the job,We bought this to keep the cat from jumping through the deck railing and escaping into the yard. It works fine. We wound up using zip ties because we didn't have the patience to thread each hole with the string provided. It is as the photo shows -- white-- but you can see through it. I like that you can secure it on the top and on the bottom. Cats are clever but our cat has not tried to claw it or go through it so I can't speak to that factor. He took one look and gave up :)
4,Does the job but...,"It was a necessity that we got one of these for our home that had a long railing with bricks at the bottom and 2 babies. It does the job of keeping the kids from falling through the railings, I just wish the strings were zip ties, or something more durable that doesn't come untied every few days. I guess I could go buy some zip ties, just wish they came with it. It was a bit long but I was able to fold it over at the end and bottom with no trouble. The ties look pretty tacky, but safety is more important. It's a good price for what you get."
2,not for all banisters,We bought this for our banister. Did not work for our needs. You basically get a stack of string to tie it on with. We tied it on and it left gaps everywhere and our daughter could basically slide her hands over the top and Yank it down. Also where the banister meets the wall we got it as close as we could but since it ties on we could only get it about an inch from the wall at the closest. Our daughter easily pushed right past it. We returned it for a refund after just a few days.
5,"Good Heater, Cheap, Many Saftey Features.","This KeroHeat Ct-1100 Must be seasoned before normal use (all kerosene heaters do). Like a cast iron pan if you skip this it will smell and smoke. [...]. I did what the site said, and I have been quite pleased with my results. What you do is, start with a quarter tank of Kerosene, burn the heater on high for about a half hour, until the top plate is red hot. Back to low for a hour. Finally back to high for a hour and let run out of fuel. I use CLEAR kerosene and the deodorant additive as well. Don't get too fixed on a certain sent, this unit is too efficiant and you will not have the sent filling the air in your home. I also recommend the KeroHeat HMN-110 radiant and KeroHeat CV-2230 convection. **Dont forget to run the Humidifire in your home**"
4,works great,Bought for a back-up because we are total electric. Tried it out in the garage and it works well although it does give off a little odor but nothing bad.
1,Poor quality,"Parts ratteling around in carton. took it apart and found tip over parts jammed in front. just poor quality control at the manufacture.I have no time for this. I did reviews before buying and I should have just picked it up at Home Depot. lesson learned for me.This is three strikes and your out for Amazon. The Wagner paint sprayer, Shock Collar for our dog, and now this heater.Five Hundred bucks down the drain.I doubt this review will find its way to the web but at the least I got a moment to vent."
5,Pennsylvania Wilds,"Excellent and concise historical review of the Allegheny National Forest area of Pennsylvania. Good photography throughout, but I would have enjoyed even more pictures."
5,Great box for HAM Radio EMCOMM kit,Mounting a radio in this thing with a battery and some other stuff is going to work great. I highly recommend it.
4,Much better book quality than the 29th Ed.,"It's a bit slow to find what I need when using this book as a quick reference for answering PE exam questions. I like how thorough it is and how I can find the general section I need with relative ease. A few misses though.. For instance, where are the force equations (radial and axial) for bevel gears??"
2,Nat. Geographic: April 1961 (Map Supplement: Battlefields of the Civil War) (Vol. 119),"The item was advertised as coming with the Map Suppliement: Battlefields of the Civil War. However, the map did not come with the issue of National Geographic. There was no response from the vendor as to how the purchase could be made good. No response, poor service. Stay away from this vendor."
3,Carousel of a one trick pony,"Merry-Go-Round has a carousel of fans riding on Emitt Rhodes' painted pony poetry. In the mid/late 60's there was a gathering storm of LA bands that spun around Mamas/Papas/ with a Beatles revolver.Merry-Go-Round had a regional San Francisco/LA Top 5 hit,(top 60 nation wide) with ""Live"". A great single on A&M;, Herb Alpert's independent label, there were plenty of grins thinking hits after hits due to Emitt's songwriting and ..well it didn't happen.A couple of LPs and another classic song, ""She's a Very Lovely Woman"", recorded by Linda Ronstadt and others, gave Emitt some cache and a contract with ABC/Dunhill and a self-titled LP released in 1970. Coveted by collectors, Emitt Rhodes claims classic.This CD has an informatative booklet of LA rock that is worth the price alone!"
5,What a great release!!!,"This would be worth the money for the inclusion of the first and only Merry Go Round LP in its entirety, but this ups the ante by also including the '68 and '69 recordings that were eventually released as Emmit's first solo LP, American Dream. For my money, that was his best solo album. I know his eponomous debut on Dunhill is considered his best, but I've got the original LP of that and it sounds very boxy, like bootleg demos. But American Dream here sounds very sharp, and employs excellent musicians that enhance the songs. Emmit's one-man show on his three LPs for Dunhill may be gutsy, but in fact he's not the greatest engineer, and the LPs suffer as a result.But enough of that. Back to the Merry Go Round album. This is a sorely overlooked gem, a sixties lost classic. This band was brimming with talent. Emmit's songs were excellent, the production crisp and the playing tight. Also, the harmonies were beautiful.This is a gem."
4,Shameful,"Customer service is horrible. They lead you to believe the 5 year warranty is for replacement. The ""replacement"" is them letting you buy another one for about the same price as a new one, not including shipping of course. The pillow is foam with a thin tshirt knit pillow case. My husbands pillow made it 4,years and just started coming apart with pin holes in the case. Mine is a little better but I just bought him a Tri Core pillow -better quality for the price. Buyer beware."
5,excellent pillow,"You have to size the pillow correctly, but this brand is the best if you have neck problems. It delivers on the claims and really helps me sleep!"
4,Great!,"What's not to love about the Russel fittings? The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they can be a little pricey. As for performance and compatibility, they always work!"
1,For MARRIED COUPLES,The coupon book description should have mentioned that most of the contents pertained to married couples with children.
4,Nice,I liked these. If you are needing some coupons in a hurry you can order 60 Sexy Coupons by Michael Webb that can be instantly downloaded. That is what I did for a last minute birthday present for my spouse (who said it was the best one of all).Have fun.
2,Not so GREAT!!,"I like the idea of these coupons, and I purchased them based on the reviews of the others. However,the majority of the coupons, we won't even use. For example, An ""All you need is love"" Coupon, which entitles you to as many Beatles CDs as it takes to complete your collection of their music; A ""Dancing Lesson"" at a professional studio; The ""Great Ski Weekend""; The ""Tea for Two"" Coupon...Good for an afternoon of English style tea..etc..."
5,What wasI thinking??,When i had my baby 10 mos. ago the way to go was a diaper stacker so i went out andbought one. well thingshave changed and shes notthat little baby that stays put anymore. Now that she can grab i have powder flyingall overthe place wipes magiclycomming out of the tub. Not anymore..i finally gave in and got rid of the diaperstackerand bought this product and all i can say is what a hasle free item this is. everything is there for me imight needat a diaperchange. its within my reach but outof my daughters reach. A great product by and by.If iknow anyone expecting in the future i will buy this for them weather they askfor it or not.
2,Don't waste your money,"This diaper stacker is a joke. The diapers come out 3 at a time, the shelf for the wipes container will buckle if you have a full container, and the plastic is very flimsy. I brought this because of the great reviews this product got. After just one day of using this I decided to pack it up and return it. I don't believe this product is ment to withstand the test of time."
4,Fits my Graco Lauren changing table perfectly!,"I had to return a previous purchase because it wasn't suitable for my changing table. For anyone with a Graco Lauren table, this depot fits perfectly on the side rail! I give only 4 stars as opposed to 5 because I think if the side ""accessory holders"" were just a bit deeper, I would be 100% thrilled with this purchase. A few items I keep in these side containers are a bit tall and I feel they are more likely to fall out because of this. So far nothing has fallen out though. There was absolutely no damage in shipping and I do not feel that the depot is very likely to crack - short of me throwing it at the wall. It seems sturdy and holds plenty of diapers."
3,not good for dresser type changing tables,"This is a good product if you are hanging it off a changing table but I was looking for an organizer for the dresser/changing table and this does not stand up on it's own. It has a very weak bottom used just to hold the diapers in, not as a base. I ended up returning it."
4,Nifty little item,"Like many other reviewers, we used this on our Pack N Play as part of a secondary changing station. It needed a little force fitting but worked okay. The unit has helped us keep everything we need for changes organized and ready. We've had no trouble with diapers falling out as some have reported. Yes, the side compartments are on the small side, but they manage to hold a tub of vaseline, a container of Purell, a tube of baby lotion and a brush."
1,Diaper Depot?,"This is a cheap piece of plastic crap. Small diapers don't fit, and only small stuff fits in the sides. Its very flimsy and so not worth $12.99."
3,"Great idea, needs a bit more work","I thought that the warmer didn't fit on the depot, but after careful research, it does. The side bins could stand to be a little bigger. We use bag balm for diaper rash cream and it won't fit in it. Also, only the lotion bottle will fit in one side. The diaper holder is great, right height and fits a few days worth of diapers (we keep the decorative diaper stacker filled to the brim and just refill this every few days)."
4,Needs minor improvements,"We got this in conjunction with Prince Lionhart wipe warmer. It is wonderful becasue it allows for the wipes, diapers, powder, and a rash ointment all to be stored at your fingertips. It also works well to prevent damage to your changing table due to the warmer getting hot (which does happen). As for the complaints about too little storage...we have a full sized powder, ointment, alcohol pads, a brush, clippers, and nail files in the side bins...which is more than enough stuff.The only complaint that we have is the diaper storage. It is a weird size! If it was just a little wider you could double stack little diapers. As it is, you have to single stack them and there is a ton of wasted space on the sides. They also pop out 3 at a time...great if you have triplets but a pain if you just have one. It just needs a little bit or re-designing and it would be awesome!But, all in all it is a great little extra that provides well needed extra storage."
3,Could have been sturdier,"I bought this for my pack n play, put it on the side, filled it with diapers, put cotton balls in one side, a tub of Vaseline in the other, and it cracked in two places. Not exactly sure how it's still clinging on, but I daren't add the wipe box on top. I like the idea and it is really handy, I just can't believe it cracked under so little additional weight."
5,LOVE IT!,"I received this for my baby shower and it was one of the most useful things I've owned. It conveniently holds what I need and no need to go looking for baskets or drawers for the needed items. Now that my baby walks, she can even pull out the diaper herself or have my other little one get the things I need. It hooked up so nicely to my dresser with changing top. This was heaven sent and would definitely recommend. :-) Just wish it was a more durable material although I haven't had problems or cracks in it."
3,Won't fit on my sleigh-style changing table!,"I purchased the Diaper Depot to have the basic items I need to change my daughter's diaper at the same level of the changing table. I have a traditional changing table and was tired of reaching for items on the shelf below. Well, because the furniture in my daughter's room is SLEIGH-STYLE, the end bars are wider, and the Diaper Depot is designed to hang on a thinner rail. The only way it would fit is if I put it on the side rail, which would then be in my way. It IS a well-made product and is a good concept, so I'll have to give it 3 stars to be fair. Just open the box and look at it to make sure it fits before you buy!! My solution: I found a changing table organizer at Target that hangs down off the end rail; my husband was able to bend the organizer's hooks out a little wider to fit on the table. Also, Diaper Depot does sell a dresser-style organizer if you have a dresser next to your changing table."
2,Be aware,"Be aware this product does NOT fit all Prince Lionheart brand wipe warmer containers. I have the premium PL wipe warmer and it does NOT fit! If you plan to use it to hold normal plastic container of wipes, then you're fine."
3,Great storage- Doesn't fit my crib,"This caddy holds what I need it to hold, but it does not fit over the edge of my particular baby crib- the lip on it is too small/narrow to fit. I wish that had been made more clear in the description. It does not fit all cribs!"
5,Such a simple solution,"We were originally keeping the diapers and wipes on the shelf of the changing table, probably because we didn't think there was a better option. I am so glad we found this, it works and fits perfectly for our changing table.The only issue we have now is that the wipes are accessible by the child being changed, and sometimes she likes to sit up and try to grab the pack. But if this wasn't there, I'm sure she would just find something else to do that is just as inconvenient."
2,"Could be handy, if made better","I thought this would be a great way to keep diapers and other items close at hand. I was able to use it for a short time until the plastic piece that the wipes container sits on broke. They need to use a better plastic. I did have a problem with more than one diaper coming out at a time, like others have, but learned if you pull upward a little usually only one diaper will come out at a time. If the company would use a stronger plastic I think this could be a very useful item."
2,Won't work if it doesn't fit over rail,"I don't even know why I registered for this.We change our baby on a dresser. The crib is behind the changing table and besides, hanging it over the crib would clutter the crib.It's no good if it isn't going to fit over the rail of your changing table. If it does, maybe it's good for that.But isn't that the whole point of a changing table? To have shelves and stuff where you can put things?I just use a dresser and a shelf next to it and it works great. This product might be helpful with the right furniture, but I gave mine away."
3,Warning!,"Prince Lionheart makes two types of diaper depots. This type, the ""Diaper Depot"", hangs from the changing table and the other type, ""Dresser Top Diaper Depot"", sits on the dressing table. The ""Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer"" ONLY fits on the ""Dresser Top Diaper Depot"". Unfortunately, the ""Dresser Top Diaper Depot"" does not seem to be available from babiesrus.com. You can look these items up on www.princelionheart.com ---but they don't sell items off of this site."
2,not good for fold out changing table,"After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type."
1,Not the best bet for more than one child in diapers,The diaper depot is not the best choice if you have more than one size of diapers in your home. It seems specificaly designed for those homes in which there is one baby and no toddlers. It is just as easy for the toddler to get into the diapers and have them all over in no time. I would recommend thinking through your own family situation before purchasing this product.
3,Great is you plan on changing diaper in the crib,This is a great organizer for diapering things but not great if your changing table is not next to your crib. This item is made only to hang on the rim of the crib and can not stand alone on a table. I have my changing table across the room away from the crib and have to use a separate basket filled with diapering items to change my baby. I would recommend only buying this if your crib is right next to your crib or if you plan on changing the baby in the crib.
1,Would Pass On This One,"We purchased this product the same day that we purchased the wipes warmer. When we got home we tried to attach the depot to our Storkcraft Aspen Changing Table, however, it wouldn't fit. Not that I minded, because as soon as it was out of the box, I realized that it was a complete waste of money. It is just some hard plastic. This diaper holder didn't hold our daughter's newborn size diapers and the side compartments wouldn't even hold more than one item. Needless to say, it went back the very next day. If I were you, I would pass on this item and get a diaper stacker to match your nursery and get either a changing table with a drawer, or hang an organizer onto the wall for other necessities."
3,Poor fit with the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"We bought this to use with the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer. The warmer's base has slots that make it fit onto the depot only one way, which is facing away from the changing table. This presents two problems: if you have the depot on the side of the table, then the lid opens in the opposite direction as would be convenient, and the more serious problem is that the warmer's cord then sticks straight out *into* the changing table! That seems far too unsafe for me to feel comfortable using the two items together. If you wanted to just have a standard package of disposable wipes sitting on top, then this would work just fine."
2,poor quality,Great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction. It would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table ...really.
5,Nothing Else Like It!,"The Diaper Depot is clear, so it matches ANY nursery. It fits nicely over the side of my sons crib and changing table (although, it doesn't fit on the END of either because the bars are too thick). The wipe warmer fits nicely on the top and just about anything you can think of will fit into the side pockets! I have just ONE question for Prince Lionheart... what took so long?"
4,It's Great But......,So I ordered this organizer so we wouldn't have to keep bending over to get diapers off of the changing table shelf. This is exactly what we wanted and it is sturdy and holds everything that we need it to hold. Unfortunatly we have to return it because it doesn't fit our changing table. We have a white Graco Changing Table from Target so if you have this changing table it will not work with it. Which makes me sad.
2,Cracked,"I ordered this to hang on the end of my Ikea changing table (as a few reviewers have noted, if you have a combination changing table/dresser, this may not work for you). Unfortunately, it arrived and was cracked and crushed at the top. So, I sent it back and requested a replacement. AGAIN, cracked. So I sent that back and asked for a refund. I found the same product (for $14, a little bit more but not terrible) at Babies R Us. I opened two boxes at the store to inspect them and BOTH were cracked or chipped. I don't know if this is because of the type of pastic being used, a defective batch from the factory, or simply bad luck on my part. But, I am going to pass on this product although it seemed like it would have worked well otherwise. Disappointing."
4,Nice Organizer.,"The Diper Depot works well with our Prince Lionheart whipe warmer. It's ridgid, plastic construction makes it a stable platform as compaired to the soft vinyl organizers. My only whish is that the hinges on the lid, of the diper dispenser, could be made a little sturdier."
5,WHY DIDN'T WE BUY THIS SOONER?,"Wow!!! Has the Diaper Depot made our lives easier at the changing table! Our son was pretty long at birth and remains way above average... so our changing table was crowded right from the start! This Diaper Depot keeps diapers and wipes right at hand but OFF the changing table. No more ""kicking the wipes and diapers"" off the table for my son! :) Now we can use the entire changing table for just that: changing! No more storage. The diaper depot is a ""snap"" to attach- it just hangs on the side of your changing table; the diapers (about 10 fit easily), wipes (sit on top of the diapers and ""move down"" as you use up your diaper supply) and 2 ""bottles of choice"" (I have powder and lotion) fit right into it- easy and quick to grab what you need and especially to ""restock""! What an inexpensive time and hassle saver!"
5,Does the job!,I finally purchased one of these when my daughter was 19 months because I was tired of looking for the diaper cream underneath her legs and having her kick at the wipes. Now the changing table is free of clutter except for the dirty diaper that I have to make sure she doesn't get her feet into. Great purchase and the price is not too bad.
3,Doesn't fit Premium Prince Lionheart Diaper Warmer,"I purchased this because it was the same brand as my diaper warmer. It is shown in the pictures with a diaper warmer. I assumed it would work....I assumed wrong. However, it does fit perfectly on my changing table and would be a nice little organizer."
3,Informative but dry,"Gates had access to some of the most fascinating characters in the history of the Cold War. His observations are incisive and revealing about many of these personalities; however, his book often reads like one might imagine a CIA memo reads, rather dry. The book provides feedback on several important historical instances but it does not go into much depth on any. I do not recommend it as a book used to learn the history of that era. Instead I would read it to gain a further understanding of what went on behind the scenes.In general, I find Gates to be an interesting character himself. He has some hilarious anecdotes about life in the CIA. Such as when he is walking up the steps of Air Force One and turns to flip off several of the top officials (I think it was) in Romania after they botch his passport. In addition to a often dry sense of humor he also seems to have a great deal of character and integrity."
4,Useful benchmark on intelligence-policy relationship,"I wore out one fountain pen on this book. Bob Gates has served his country, and five presidents, as earnestly and capably as anyone might, and there is much to learn from this book. The level of detail is quite good. He is very critical of the Directorate of Operations for both misbehavior and a lack of management control in relation to Central America, and as one who was there I have to say, he is absolutely right. We disagree on the point of intelligence (he would say, ""secrets for the president"", I would say ""knowledge for the Nation"") but I believe we would agree on this: intelligence is important, and intelligence merits deep and sustained interest by the President."
4,Pretty Good Book from an Intelligence Pro,"Robert Gates saw it all during the Cold War and survived the bureaucratic shuffling of five presidents. His observations on events all over the globe prove an incredibly insightful addition to information about the Cold War. Gates, however, is slightly biased because he worked for both the CIA and State, but nevertheless, the book presents most ideas that allow readers to take their own angle. Overall a good book which I would recommend."
4,decision making and Cold War from an insider's view,"The book provides a clear understanding of the Cold War years during four administrations. Gates' observations present a personal account of state beurocracy and decision making. As a member of the Central Intellgience Agency, Gates approaches the subject from unique perspectives. I think for those of you, who are interested in reading about Cold War and policy making, this book is a notable one."
2,An insight into mediocrity in government,"I was hoping for a work of academic skill enhanced by practical experience. What I got was a demonstration of the level of mediocrity common in government service. The author, who rose through CIA ranks to become first head of the analytical directorate (DDI) and then CIA director (and now Secretary of Defense), shows himself as an intellectual lightweight. It turns out that his only qualification for the analyst job initially was washing out as an operations officer."
4,Great Old School Punk,"This CD just screams attitude. Elvis Mcman has been around my local scene for a number of years now, and this CD has all the attitude and edge of their live performances. A great find and wothing picking up!"
1,3/1=0???,Dig this... several of the answers on the back of the cards are WRONG - Like some sort of printing error. It's really hard to believe that they would release an educational product with the wrong answer on the back of about a dozen cards out of a pack of 52. It was educational for us... stay away from this product - make your own set as a family project.
1,NO package...,"There was NO ""package"" at all... the UPS label and ""packing slip"" was stuck on the muffler... both ends of the muffler are out of round and will require repair, with a tool I don't have, before it will be serviceable... whoever fulfilled this order for Amazon are IDIOTS... unless you have a pipe expander, don't waste your time or money!"
3,Nice Watch - But Customer Support Is Needed,"I just received this watch. The transaction was smooth and the watch arrived within a week after the order was placed. It is a very nice watch. However, the watch band is missing the loop that holds the end of the band in place after it is buckled. I have contacted TimeZone123 and will give an update about: (1) how quickly they respond, (2) if they replace the watch or mail a loop, and (3) whether or not I have to return the watch for a replacement.UPDATE: Quick Response - but was asked to return the watch for a relacement - this was more trouble and expense than just getting a loop locally."
2,"An Okay Book, But There Are Better Ones For Students","Honestly, this is a book you don't need. Torts are not that difficult and this text is not the best aid for a student. While it comprehensive on the subject, you'd be better served to supplement your casebook with a guide like an Emanuel or Gilberts. Because Torts are not that complex, the brevity and structure of those two will probablely better serve you when it comes time for the final. Furthermore, the Emmanuel's has two additions and tries to match sections to your casebook. While in general it is a fine book, if I were a student, I would go another route."
3,Perils a Plenty,"The novel isn't as well written as it could have been. Nonetheless, it is a fast paced story with enough action to satisfy those who hunger for adventure. My only other criticism is that Rita, the leading lady, comes across as a rather weak personality - not really a fit mate for a jungle superman. I was far more impressed by Mea, the wicked ruler of Monango who, although evil, is far more of a woman than Anjani's pale and ineffectual love interest.."
2,Disappointed.....again.,"So far this is the 10th book in Akashic's ""Noir"" series that I have read and it was more of a dud then I care to admit.After reading the first ""Brooklyn Noir"" I was in love with the series but like many other things in life it is never as good as your first.""Beef Kills"" by Rosemarie Yu is the one noteworthy story.The rest are a big yawn."
1,"Poor range, sound quality","This ""call"" is a toy. It doesn't even make my dogs perk up their ears, that's if I can make it work. I have to be about 5 feet away before it will receive the signal. i tried installing fresh batteries, thinking that was the problem, but had the same results. It is fine for a childs toy, but not as a predator call."
4,Great BRS,This BRS Pathology is a great tool to have. Tells with mild depth about each pathologic disease that is important to know about and worry oneself about.
5,Amazing,"This book is a godsend--it was my best friend, my baby during 2nd year and for the Boards. I can't praise it enough. It had just enough information in it about everything that I needed, it was an excellent basis for pathology for the Boards. Supplement with a Robbins Path Book if you want extensive detail (and for the great pictures in Robbins!) and you'll be set."
3,Don't use for Step 1,"This is a good book for class and helping to pick up a few key words for each disease, but it does not explain anything. Details are lacking. If you want to get through path in 2-3 days, this is your book. If you want to know path, get something else."
3,It's good but not excellent,This seems like a good book but it is missing a lot of essential information. I think it should be complemented by test taking.
2,Too poor,"I am reading Robbin's and Cotran:Pathologic basis of desease:it is too long and I spend too much time to prepare for Usmle 1,but BRS Pathology is too poor.This book needs to be doubled:so it will became enough for that examination and near you must add an atlas,a colour atlas,to see what the student is are studying.Excuse me for my poor english.By.Giampiero Gasparrini MD"
3,"great ""buzzwords""","the book is good for an overall review, however I do not believe it is enough. Goljan is better because he provides one-liner explanations of why some things are the way they are, which makes you understand the concept better, rather than just memorize it. BRS has some good tables, and review questions, but the questions are waaaayyy to easy for anything, path course or step 1, something I found BRS does a lot in all their books. The comprehensive review at the back of the book is 100x better."
5,Somehow Form a Family (Stories That Are Mostly True),This book rekindled a flame in me to write some of my memoirs for our children and grandchildren. Written with heart and humor. Evokes many childhood memories.
4,"Shooting the Cat, etc.","I met Tony Earley yesterday during the Festival of Southern Cultures at the University of Tennessee at Martin. Our group had the unique opportunity to sit with him once yesterday and once today and pick his brain about this book. It is a very amazing piece of literature, with metaphors hidden just below the rocky surface. His short stories include very insightful mantras...especially the ones about shooting the cat (not for cruelty, but out of pity) and hunting deer. I don't really know how else to describe this book, so all I can say is that you should buy it and read it as soon as possible! Also, he teaches at Vanderbilt University in Nashville if any of you go/are thinking of going there."
3,X-Pensive Winos,Excellent performance by some great players! The quality of the music rates 5 stars; this CD garners 3 stars overall for the quality of the disc. Fresh out of the package it skips on two tracks. And no- it's not my player; it's the CD. The convenience factor disappears with mail ordering when you have to return/exchange an item and this is no exception. Not to mention the shipping expense-for this reason alone the CD will not be returned.
3,Could Have Stood You Up--But I Did Did Didn't,"Not a bad live LP, but certainly a let-down after TALK IS CHEAP.The main problem here, other than the inclusion of a couple of rather pedestrian tunes, is a drummer with the imagination of a worm. This may as well be a metronome. Contrary to popular belief, Charlie Watts is more than a time-keeper, and this band would have benefited from that kind of creativity.That said, this is still a quality LP, well worth having--AFTER you listen to the great TALK IS CHEAP about 1000 times."
2,"disappointing to me, but you may like it","I like almost all of the bands from the classic rock era and many of the alternative bands up until the mid 90s. I wasn't expecting the Rolling Stones with this CD, but I was expecting more than I got. I believe this is essentially the CD of the DVD of the same performance. I can only say, like I did with the DVD, the music is mediocre at best to me. Nothing really moved me and after viewing the DVD I had no interest in hearing it again on CD. At least with the DVD watching the band was a distraction from the music. I only watched it once and likely won't again. It wasn't anything in the way they played or the sound quality. The performance was spirited, but the music just didn't do anything for me. I won't buy any other Keith Richards and the Wonderful Winos, that's for sure."
4,Talk is Cheap,".This live CD, recorded during the FABULOUS ""Talk is Cheap"" tour, primarily represents a second recording of the studio album (and a few great extras) with very appreciative crowd noise sandwiched between the songs. Nothing wrong with that, because these are songs that are MEANT to be played live - but the energy and production values of the original studio ""Talk is Cheap"" album is so extraordinary, this live album primarily speaks to Keith completists. I once read Keith questioned releasing this live album, but there were sooooooooo many bootlegs out of the winos live preformances, he felt his fans deserved a definitive version."
3,Not an action novel,"From the cover and the description, I assumed it was a WWII Action novel. I was wrong. This is a character study of 4 or 5 friends. Well written but not what I expected."
2,Doesn't match the picture...,"I was not pleased when I received this item. Granted, the seller got the item to me quickly and effortlessly, but the product did not look anything like the picture. The shirt was not even the team colors. The lettering looked cheaply done. I do not want to bury this seller, just the item. I just wish there was more of a close up on the shirt."
2,Very Lightweight (cheap),"The product mostly does what's promised, but it's very lightweight and very easy to break. This doesn't take much abuse before it snaps. Don't plan on stacking more than two high at most."
3,"Functional, but fragile","Product stores and dispenses standard 12oz cans fine, but construction is of a nature that I carry these very delicately when I am moving them around. While I have not tested them to see what their breaking point is, they are made of flimsy plastic that does not seem capable of withstanding much pressure.PS. If you like Coors beer, don't buy these. Your cans won't fit!"
1,Can Disposer Tote,Was disappointed that the dispenser/tote did not dispense the 12 oz. soft drink cans. The cans fit too tightly against the sides and would not move or rotate toward the opening. Have to manually push each can to get it out of the dispenser/tote.Purchased four.Would not purchase any more.
5,Does the job,Does the job well. Saves refrigerator space and a whole lot sturdier than the pop cartons refrigerator packs.
3,Works ok,"The levels don't seem to be at a steep enough angle, so the cans will sometimes not roll all the way to the dispenser under their own weight and they need a little help. I would have spent a few more bucks to get a better working product, but it works ok."
3,Flimsy but they work,"They work as advertised but feel very flimsy. I wouldn't stack them as shown in the picture, as they will probably fall over and shatter into a puddle of broken plastic and beverage remains."
4,More room,just what I needed to clear some apace in my frig help to make less clutter. there kind of wobbley.
5,saves space,"I love this purchase, so convenient and makes so much more room in the refrigeratorwish I would of been using this a long time ago. Glad I discovered it. :-)"
4,"So-so, but works perfectly.","Must admit, they are a bit cheap looking and feeling, but they will get the job done. I like that they are stack-able. I bought six for the garage shelf and I'm happy with them. For their purpose they are great. A higher quality material would be nice, but then they'd be more money. They'll do the trick, for sure."
1,Not worth the money,Cans are always getting stuck and the handle is always falling down in the way.I would return them if I wasn't so lazy...
1,Can tote,"This is another cheap piece of junk from China. I wanted to use mine in the fridge for cans, what a joke ! Cans wouldn't roll like my old one did, very flimsy made, course look where it came from ? I finally took it out and threw it in the trash. I would not recommend this to one of my not so liked people. Totally Junk."
3,Fine,"I ordered two of these and stacked one on top of the other in my fridge. Definitely helped to keep it more organized and I always have cold pop now! They are a bit flimsy and sometimes the cans don't roll forward. When it's completely full and you take one out from the bottom, the rest roll and you have to watch out and make sure they don't push a 2nd can out!I doubt I would try and carry one of these full of pop by the handle, but I didn't buy it to carry it around, so I can't really complain about that.All in all, worth it for the price, but I know there are better ones out there if you want to spend a little more."
2,Can Dispenser not for fridge,"I was very disappointed with this can dispenser. First, it does not fit in any fridge that I know of. I tried mine & family member's and it does not sit in flat and won't allow the door to shut in others. In addition, the seller did not include any information for returning it. I am now stuck with something that I paid almost $16 (including S&H) that I cannot use. Warning, I did not attempt to carry it with cans in it, it seemed too flimsy and seemed like the handle would pop off if I did try. Would not recommend this product."
5,quality rabbit feeder,This is the standard size of most all rabbit feeders. The best part about this one is that it has the lid to cover the food. The similar feeder at Tractor Supply did not have the cover and it cost more.
3,Hot Wired: A Bel Barret Mystery,Fun book to read but I enjoy taking a little more time solving a crime :)
1,Boring,"The characters are unbelievable and lack any development or depth. Everyone is superficial. Everybody just ""happens"" to tell Bel everything they know, so untrue to real life I couldn't finish it. Great reading for 12 year olds, but I'll choose Adam Dagliesh and J. P. Beaumont any day."
4,Wish they were still together...,"I was a huge fan of Switched's first album, and couldn't wait until this one came out. While I think on the whole it's not quite as good as Subject to Change (they admit that these songs are really just demos) the album has several solid tracks that make it well worth purchasing. Personally I love ""Save Myself"", ""Into Disaster"", and ""Memories of You"". Some of these songs just sound so heavy I don't know how they could tune that low.The 2nd disc has the live songs from their Spread Your EP, plus demos of a bunch of songs from Subject to Change."
5,ALL THE WAY YUGIOH FAN,Didn't have this volume in my yugioh collection so I got it so I can have my favorite episodes at my disposal
5,Great DVD,"Great product! So glad I can get the old Yu-gi-oh episodes for my kids. They like the old Yu-gi-oh which is not on t.v. anymore, so it's great that I was able to purchase this DVD for them. Item arrived very quickly and nicely packaged. Thanks."
5,Beginners Greek Grammar,"This has been a book,that we use at our Bible School and it has help many get a better veiw of the Word Of God."
2,no statistical information,"This is not what I though it was going to be. I needed a resource for employment tests, but there is not reliability or validity information in this book, rendering it useless for my cause."
2,Ponderous period drama from The Master,"""Under Capricorn"" was the second and last film (after ""Rope"") that Hitchcock completed under the ill-fated Transatlantic banner the vehicle has set up after release from his Selznick contract. Like ""Rope"", Hitchcock experimented with long takes and complicated camera movements.Unlike ""Rope"", however, ""Under Capricorn"" is a talky bore. Hitchcock had little feel for this type of material - a period drama set in colonial Australia. The film is not helped by being entirely shot in a studio - a limitation of the shooting style and budget - so has no local flavour whatsoever which is what this type of film needs.Even Hitchcock himself admitted this was a dud. For Hitchcock completists only."
3,The story is miserable but the photography is wonderful,"There's nothing actually wrong with this film. The acting is good, the sets are good, the script is good, but it's so miserable. It's a story of a young man who comes willingly to Australia in the days of transportation of criminals, befriends another man and his wife, and falls in love with the wife. There is a tragic element to this story and the happy ending of the last five minutes seems bolted on.This might appeal to fans of a certain type of melodrama popular in the 1940s and 1950s. The four lead actors acquit themselves well, and Margaret Leighton shines as a housekeeper with delusions of grandeur. Michael Wilding is perhaps too fey to be a passionate suitor. Hitchcock's direction is not as stylised as it would later become, but is more than competent. Jack Cardiff's cinematography highlights colourful costumes and sets and makes everything a visual treat, and is perhaps the best aspect of this film."
3,eva25at is ignorant,"...First of all this is NOT a Selznic picture. Hitchcock was free from his contract with selznic after ""The Paradine Case."" Hitchcock produced this under his own Transatlantic Productions.Selznic didn't have the remotest thing to do with this movie! No this isn't as good as most Hitchcock movies but it is entertaining."
2,Not one of Hitchcock's better movies,"I love some of Hitchcock's earlier films like The 39 Steps, Rich and Strange, and the original 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, but this was a disappointment. It's your typical Hollywood melodrama, a hackneyed, talky chick flick that runs 40 minutes too long. It's rare that I find a movie so unengaging that I want to quit in the middle of watching, but I was seriously tempted with this one. The only interesting part was a dreamy 10 minute sequence close to the end where (SPOILER) the jealous maid tries to poison the lady of the house. That was the only really ""Hitchcockian"" thing in the whole movie.I've never been a fan of Ingrid Bergman, finding her overrated in the looks department, but it wasn't until watching this movie that I realized that not only was she not the looker Hollywood hyped her up to be, but the woman couldn't act! Under Capricorn would've been immeasurably better (though still not great) with a different lead actress."
3,Period films not Hitchcock at his best,"This is, as far as I know, the only period film Hitchcock ever made. Being very familiar with most of his movies for many years I was excited to finally see another one from a high point in his career that I had never seen. I think it's interesting that he tried something new and different, for him, but it doesn't completely work. It's always a pleasure, though, to watch Ingrid Bergman in anything, and Joseph Cotten for that matter. And this isn't horrible, just definitely a failed attempt. I think ""Saboteur"" is another failed attempt by Hitchcock and this isn't even as good as ""Saboteur"". Still, all things considered, die hard Hitchcock fans should see it - to me it's interesting to watch anything he attempted."
3,yak yak yak,"Hitchcock did this film as a favor to Bergman. A boring costume picture, the only saving grace is Joseph Cotton. Anything with Cotton in it is worth watching just for his unequaled screen presence. The 'loser' sort of wins in the end, giving Cotton a rare, cheery ending. To be fair, the acting in this film is really good, as is the cinematography. But the story, pacing, and overall energy of the film falls flat. ""Under Capricorn"" would be the next to last picture I'd ever recommend to anyone unfamiliar with Hitchcock (""Jamaica Inn"" still the lamest of the bunch)."
2,"good, but not great","This book distinguishes itself by concentrating on step-by-step walk-throughs of practical exercises. And while that is helpful, only a few questions in the test are simulations. Many of the exam questions are about esoteric details, which are not covered by this book.I purchased four books to study for the 70-431, and I would place this in the bottom two."
4,SQL Server Street Smarts,"It is an informative book with repetitious problems, but that's what's needed in being a DBA. I have not completed the book yet, so I'm not a great authority on this book."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I've never been a fan of James Bond. Probably, because I grew up with Pierce Brosnan as 007 and he sucked. I decide to give the series another shot, not because of Bond, but rather Daniel Craig. I have been a fan of Craig's for some time, having seen several of the films from overseas. I knew then that he would be a huge action star and now he's 007. As for my first Bond movie, it was pretty good. Craig was fantastic and avoided much of the cliché Bond moments that most of us have come to loath. The film was entertaining, but also pretty predictable and much longer than it needed to be. I was also very unimpressed by the bad guys. I thought Bond villains were supposed to be classic, but these guys were rather forgettable. I'm not in love with the Bond character, but this film did open my eyes a little bit and I probably will check out Quantum of Solace in the near future."
3,Not a good Application for a slip joint,"These pliars have great grip on the right size fastens, but there is a gap in size in which is can grip. These pliars grip fastners and studs at the bottom of its size range well, and when it is sliped over to the next slot it grabs fastens near the top of its size range well, but the the fastens in the middle of the size range do not work well on either setting.The best channellock nutbester is the 410, it uses the channel lock style adjustment which gives smaller incriments, and is sized well, it has treamendous grip and almost never slips. The channellock joing on the 410 uses 2 teeth to make it extra stong.The 307 is probably only best if you need to remove bots or studs less than 5/16 of an inch. slipping the joint over allows for doing larger fasteners, but at that point the fastens are getting so large you should you use the 410 pliars which will give better grip and leverage."
2,The book is way too long for the material,"It pains me to write this review, since I lovedthe Cuckoo's Egg, but this book just isn't very good. Stoll's main point is that people are spending too much time on computers and on the Internet, and it is a valid point. He says that they should live real life, which is a good suggestion. This would have made a good magazine article.The problem is that the book is full of criticism of every minutia of the computer world. After a while Stoll justs looks petty. For example, he says that when parents encourage their children to use computers, they are telling them not to be interactive. What about the old days, when kids were told to practice the piano? The book is full of criticisms provided without context.I made it to page 150, but couldn't take any more."
4,A Must Read,"You've seen him on MSNBC, now read the book. Stoll takes the contrarian lane on the information superhighway. In a crowded marketplace where hyperbole is the norm, the author attempts to break down the essence of what computers can and cannot do. Stoll puts forth the argument that networking can at best supplment a life lived in the ""real world"", not replace it with ""virtual experiences"""
1,The author argues everything about computers is inferior.,"I was hoping for a good critique of the internet (which deserves one), and figured that the famed astronomer and author of ""The Cuckoo's Nest"" could surely deliver one. I was quite wrong. Whiny, droning, and surprisingly weak, this book would serve better as an example of how Not to write a criticism of the internet (or of anything for that matter). If you want to read a tedious list of complaints and opinions about how everything is better in ""the real world"" than on a computer, then this is your book. Unfortuneatly, as much as he paints a dark picture of the net, he also paints a naively optimistic picture of the real world. In truth, the real world is not all great, and the networks are not all bad. This is elementary. Lot's of people have joined the digital bandwagon that I sense don't have a clue why. There is much to criticize of computers and networks, but this book goes about it terribly."
5,wonderful reading giving the novice insight into cyberspace,"This book has left an enduring image of the internet as it appeared at the beginnings. Could not put it down. Read it several times to grasp the humor and style of the author. Loaned it out in a tattered condition and never got it back. Now that we have internet access I ordered it again and look forward to reading it one more time.If you like computers and suspense, this is the book for you."
3,Amusing period piece from an earlier computer age.,"I sought out this book because I had a sudden recall of his C-SPAN address some months/years back. At that time, my local bookseller (Lompoc,CA--Books West) advised me that it was very overdue. ((Nice store. If you come here, see their shop)) Anyone who can hold my interest that long deserves his royalty. In my final years in the military, we were using the word O-B-E as a verb. This is still interesting, Though I do concur with most of the other reviews on his ""undisciplined"", rambling, style. Before the first third of his book, he said that the online trade totaled something around 25K per day. Is it ironic that I read these words with a purchase from amazon.com (daily sales about 1.7 million per day)?? He has been OBE'd. He is amusing enough for me to buy his next book to see how he recovers. As a person who once got money for being a pinboy in a bowling alley, I know what it is to be Overtaken By Events."
3,Less relevant at this time!,"Mr. Stoll's words I think were more true when the book first came out in 1996. Now the Internet does have much to offer people in terms of information, interaction and communication with others.I think in terms of education, specifically elementary education, most of what Mr. Stoll says is right on. Kids need to be doing other things than using computers for most of their school day. They do need to be outdoors, moving, running, playing, interacting with peers and adults face to face.It is a good book to read overall, and one that can stretch one's thinking a bit."
2,Increasingly Dated effort,"Stoll's book is showing the effect of time. While much of the info may have been cutting edge when written, it has now been surpassed by events. I found little logical flow in the book and it ends with a disappointing and self serving Usenet discussion about an earlier book he wrote that lends little to the book's thesis."
2,A book like the Internet itself,"This book contrasts ""The Cuckoo's Egg"" (by the same author) in many ways, but most of all the disorganised style of writing which makes it impossible to find serious arguments to support the author's point of view. His opinions are indeed worth considering when submitting whole nations to electronic infrastructure nobody really needs."
2,A good essay gone horribly awry...,"...or at best, a good thesis dragged on much too long. Stoll's world view is valid - there really is a real world out there and it's darn interesting. Certainly, computers are at times frustrating, isolating money holes. But like everything else, the cyberworld is cheapened by hype, commercialization and the over use of the prefix ""cyber-"". Most of us are able to figure this out, so must it be regurgitated over and over for 236 pages? Stoll's writing is the book's strongest point, but the serial reminiscences do get taxing, and are more than a bit narcissistic. Stoll's arguments, on the other hand, suffer from a lack of consistency -- he complains that access to networks is too slow, but criticizes e-mail as being too fast for proper savoring as communication. Come on, aren't at least some of us smart enough to see these pitfalls on our own? I give this book a ""4"" only for the delicious irony that I ordered it ... over the Internet"
2,JustAnther peace of media SPAM to discredit the Internet ...,"In this book Clifford Stoll makes an important point or two about the Internet but as usual, Stoll sounds more like an unhappy child who would prefer not to share any of his toy's with the World. Clifford Stoll has found gainful employment as a main stream media goon who's sole purpose is to Bash the Internet while managing to appear credible, Clifford Stoll is truly an academic elitist who is unhappy with the Internet being open to the public wear it can act as an alternative press to the more conservative corporate main stream media outlets like MS-NBC, clearly the establishment is Internet phobic and Clifford Stoll is a spokes Man on the payroll of a media & softwear giant.. I think it's no ascedant that the NY Times, Washinton post & Chicago Tribuneno all wasted no time manufactur good revues to this 2ed rate book as a way to promote this peace of pro-establishment propaganda.................:-"
1,Pathetic groundless whining,"Summary: Clifford spends an entire book whining about computers and the Internet.Almost every paragraph of this book consists of an invalid argument and an explanation as to why this makes computers and the Internet a Bad Thing. Bet you're sick of it after the second chapter.I then skipped on through the book hoping to find anything useful, constructive, or readable. I failed.This is reading of the most frustrating kind because I couldn't resist pointing out the flaws in each of Clifford's arguments, but talking back to a book is a little pointless!Hence me writing this review, my first ever.All this book has taught me is to read reviews carefully before buying. Incidentally, Cliff, I bought your book online!"
5,What is wrong with the internet,"Clifford Stoll is surely right in all of his discussions about the internet and computers and computer usage. We are a group of aerospace engineers and have had to come face to fece with the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics for many years. It is not generally understood, but the 2nd Law says that order can not be created. Even with the pointing and clicking with a mouse, which requires zero energy we are not getting something for nothing. Someone must pay for the order acheived in any problem. The computer does not create order any more than the most elegant automobile creates energy. It's the operator that must provide the order. This is not accounted for and never will be until the 2nd Law is properly understood and applied.We have much more analysis on this subject and would like to submit it to Mr. Stoll.Thank you for your attention,Maurice S. Cahn, Director of Research Landers Search Lab Corporation PO Box 3854 Landers, CA 92285"
1,Stoll's arguments are silly and outdated.,"This book is already out of date. The authors arguments are silly and already outdated. It is classic ludite stuff. Worse than that, it is poorly constructed with many tangents unrelated to the subject. (Compare with Stoll's other book, where the tangents were always important.)"
2,Very poor quaility,"I'm not familiar with this brand, but they seem to be popular. I noticed this item did not have the best reputation on amazon, and that worried me. I decided to give it a shot since it was what I needed, and the price was decent. I returned it right away. It did not even look like SS, and there were factory defects everywhere. The brand name was even tattered away, most likely in shame of this product :/"
3,Nice buy,Its a good gift i thought the clock was a bit bigger thou but the price was perfect for this item
5,Sweeney Todd with a happy ending,"I saw this movie on a lark with some friends of mine. We were bored, were at the local video store when they had nothing worth watching, saw that it was a Dutch comedy about cannibalism and thought, ""Oh, yeah, we've GOT to see this."" We had no expectations of this film. Turns out we picked a true gem. One of the things about this film is that it's funny when you don't expect it to be, No warning, just BAM! It's funny all of a sudden!Foreign movies aren't for everyone, so I recommend renting first before buying it. If you wind up liking it, you'll probably see where I'm coming from with this review."
4,Danish Treasure,"This tale from the kingdom of Denmark is all about Svend and Bjarne, two butchers who find themselves fired, they then open their own little meat market and after a shaking start of business, Svend discovers that the customers has a very special taste for a very special kind of meat.From here the tale takes us from laughter to nail biting horror as we get kicked into a world of morbidity and murder.Svend is played by Mads Mikkelsen, whom you best know as Tristan of ""King Arthur"" and recently as Le Chiffre in the newest James Bond movie ""Casino Royale"".Great entertainment for your money."
4,"Where is that ferral sex God, Tristan?","Having become obesessed with Mads Mikkelsen as Tristan(KingArthur)I wanted to see what other movies the ""sexiest man in Denmark"" had on the market. Girls, if you are looking for that Danish pastry ,you won't find him this flick. You will find a dark comedy with a stellar preformance by Mads.I really had to watch this flick 3 times to really appreciate it. Ithink I was expecting a Tristan looking actor instead of the balding, middle aged insane butcher on the screen. I'm not quite sure if our American leading men,and Mads is the leading leading man in Denmark, would be even be offered a role such as this. Brad Pitt could never pull it off.I have just ordered 4 more movies starring Mads Mikkelsen. I admit it, I'm smitten."
5,Leg Cramp Solution,"My dad has peripheral arterial disease and diabetes. He used to be plagued by unremitting leg cramps especially at night. Quinine used to work like a champ, then it became unavailable so Dad had many painful and sleepless nights. Nothing the dr prescribed worked. He also tried many over the counter meds to no avail. Then a friend suggested this product. We were doubtful but desperate. To our surprise they work great. Dad takes about 5 per night and gets great relief. This is the only thing that works for him. The tablets are easier to take and work better for him than the caplets. P.S.: Dad says to tell you he never wants to run out again."
5,Fighting Lady,Fighting Lady is one of the best WWII documentaries of carrier aviation. It is about the aircraft carrier Yorktown(CV-10)and the fighting it was envolved in.It is in WW II color. I would highly recomend this movie to anyone interested in WW II or carrier aviation.
1,Fear What?,"This book is about what? Fear from who? Fear was brought to the eyes of the public from experts like Debecker and the way this books explains things is more like a selling point for his defense system. I guess with any book you can learn something and what I learn from this book is to make sure I don't buy the author's next work, if he produces one! The fear subject matter is not friendly material to begin with but this author tells a version that is based on here-say and if he was smart he really wouldn't say!"
1,Drive is a Problem,Despite the negative review feedback I tried this Photo Drive.It produces card errors in 2 listed cameras and does not work via an approved CF card reader with Windows XP.With XP it produces constant clicking-seeking noises and is not recognized.
2,Stopped working after 20 months,"It was OK while it lasted, other than my PDA (Dell Axim x51v) having to be restarted every now and then to recognize the drive. It stopped working after 20 months. With Flash drives so cheap now, I would avoid this type of drive."
1,EOS 20D poor performance,This CF drive has miserable write performance issues. I have the lastest Canon 20D 2.0.3 firmware installed. Apparently someone here posted that the card works great with firmware ver. 2.0.2. I am not interested in moving backwards to accomodate the card. I do not reccommend this product.
2,Didn't work on my Nikon D70s,"I tried this item on my Nikon D70s because Seagate says it works on that camera.In addition to requiring a machete to open the package and a crow bar to get it out of the little clamshell in that package, the card would not work in my camera. The shutter wouldn't release when the card was in the camera and eventually a message came up that said something like ""This card won't work"".The card would work in my computer and I was able to transfer files to it, but that isn't what I need it for.."
3,2 strong to be delicate,"These are a useful item to have in the tool kit. However, there is a bit too much force behind them for use on electronics. They tear the insulation off of 20 gauge wire...smush it until the wire is exposed. But they are perfect for gripping studier materials."
2,the book quality.,"The pages of the book are printed on newsprint paper. This is not what I care to purchase in a book. I intend to use and re-use this book a lot and newsprint type paper will not hold up to a lot of use. Newsprint turns brittle very soon after exposure to normal use. Plus, I do not like the way newsprint feels to the touch. I have been looking forward to owning this particular item for quite some time. I shall enjoy having it, just don't care for the type of paper contained in the book."
4,relaxing,"This is a decent tactical game that is easy for most to beat. The game play is real time, not turn based. There are a lot of limitatios to this game, such as you can not leave the battle area ==however I do not see it hurting the game play, as far as enjoyablity goes. this is a great game to unwind with, even more so if you want a break from fast grafics, that tend to hype you up--in a nutshell it reminds me a really good cell phone game--but with color--an for the price= its a great buy- for tactitians"
2,There is better.,"I used this book for the last two years off and on. It usually doesnt have the word I'm looking for. It does have the most basic of words but anything more is not going to be found. For example in Japan you run into many foods that dont look familiar to you, most of these dont seem to show up in this book."
4,Workhorse,"I picked up two of these for use in my retail store - they've gotten good workouts for a few years with no downside.Image quality seems fine to me, but I'm using it as a cash register touch screen, so quality is not a major issue for me - have not really had the opportunity to test on image-sensitive applications.I picked these up at a liquidation, so I got a good deal on them.Overall, no complaints. They have served me well."
4,Hot Fudge Mondays,This book has some great ideas to help students understand and relate to different parts of speech. It also has several fun writing ideas. I look forward to trying it with my 5th grade students.
2,Average at best,"This book gives good activities for spare time, but i wouldn't use it for primary instruction. It is basically a lot like all the other so called ""fun"" grammar exercises you've ever seen."
2,There are better books out there,"This book is nothing but a collection of worksheets to ""practice"" the parts of speech. The subject matter of the worksheets is a little out of the ordinary, but nothing extraordinarily creative. Each part of speech is handled separately; there's no mixed review. Unless you're planning to spend an extensive amount of time on each part of speech and can't think of how you're going to fill all that time, save your money."
5,Real nice classy deep 'n' sexy house..,"I bought this cd almost rather spontaneously since the record shop had it on the stereo. I must admit that this particular one is a fine addition to my collection. The material - 11 tracks - is cool groovy and sexy deephouse. The first track ""Fall into you"" by Soulstice sounds a lot like EBTG and is the perfect start for an hour of fine listening. Thereafter, the music just deepens and gets more sexy. The chosen songs on this compilation are up to date with its many effects. The sexy vocals and the congasdrums together with the classy cool drumbeats are all a perfect example of this! So my advice to you is, if you like sexy deep house, then there really is nothing to consider other than you just get it as soon as you can!!"
5,Essential Thing,"I purchased this cd just by reading the playlist. Since I am already a huge fan of the Naked Music label, I figured this was a ""close relative"". Well, my intuition was correct. This cd is great! It can easily be part of the Naked repetoire especially since props were given to Bruno Ybarra.After reading the other reviews, I too can highly recommend this purchase."
5,Nu De Lune on a Naked vibe!,"NU DE LUNE is a deluxely packaged album that is close to the NAKED MUSIC and LAZY DOG vibe. Featuring the likes of Soulstice, Dubtribe Soundsystem, Jon Cutler, Mikael Delta, The Rurals and chillout fave's Zero 7, whose ""Waiting Line"" gets the remix treatment from the Naked Music stable. This really is a lusicous listen full of sexy sounds and will appeal to those who like it by the pool, those who listen to music in their cars (loud with the hood down!) and couples who are enjoying a drink by the fire place!Just Damn right Essential listening (don't even get me started on the Deluxe packaging!!!!!!!!!!)AWESOME!!!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I received the book I ordered which was said to be in GOOD condition..The book itself looked dirty, some pages were folded in and all wrinkled, ( you would have thought the seller could have at least tried to straightened them out) and to top it off the seller left the store bought price on the back, which was LOWER then the price I paid for their used up old book, and thats not including shipping. Beware of this seller!!!!!"
5,love it,I bought it because my daughter has a similiar curling iron. We both like the one I purchased better than the curling iron she has.
2,Ehhh,"My hair is naturally wavy and frizzy. The curling iron does a great job of taking the frizz out but destroys my curls, it works more like a flat iron in my hair"
2,Just doesnt work,"I dont get what kindve hair this works for. Im half latina, I look caucasion, people say my hair is black, but seeing family I dont consider my hair black, I have thick straight hair, and a lot of it. I used very little hair to see if I could curl it, I heated it up to a high setting, I kept it in my hair for 15 secs, it was very hot, as I had touched it to my head by accident, practically nothing happened except for the very end was curled. Seeing I was new to curlingn irons I looked up youtube vids to see what I was doing wrong, I tried 2 techniques, rolling the hair around the shaft, then clamping, and clamping the end and rolling up, still nothing, Im keeping with my straightner to curl, its ceramic, curls last long, and it actually works... reason I looked for something else is that my particular flat iron has a gap that rips my hair out. IDK why people like this, except that it seems like a sturdy machine, it is a bit heavy."
5,I'd recommend this product.,The item arrived on time and in the condition it was advertised. The barrel was a little bigger than I had expected but it worked for me. You can use it to straighten your hair or to create gorgeous waves.
3,"good name brand, but product still has difficulties","Love how the hot tools curls hair. But they have a 'spring' problem and this brand new one is already making the squeaking noise that my older curling iron started to make after several years. Disappointing. Fortunately, an extra spring comes in the box, but how long will that last and then the possibility of buying a new curing iron. Fortunately purchasing at Amazon saved me money compared to retail stores that also carry this product and the differences were worth purchasing through Amazon...Thanks Amazon!"
2,meh,"doesn't hold my curls very well. Took a long time for the curls to even hold, it felt like i was holding this curling iron in my hair for at least 5 minutes per section. I would curl my hair and spray the curls so they would hold but within an hour they had fallen out."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is one of the rare dissappointments by Chente. I recommend the original recordings by Jorge Negrete or more recent recordings by Alberto Angel ""El Cuervo""."
1,Disappointment,"My high school biology student and I were ready to color but this is more a textbook than a coloring book. The picture on the outside of the book looks much more defined than the pictures in the book. There was a LOT of coloring in letters and numbers, and you need a VERY fine line marker to do it. You're supposed to read the text page on the left to discover how to color the picture on the right. We expected better pictures - like the one on the front of the book, and less text to wade through. Wish I'd gotten the Gray's Anatomy coloring book instead."
3,"OLD, BUT STILL MANAGEABLE","Despite its figurative shortcomings, this book has a functional approach. It did a good job in integrating and correlating all the physiological processes, which sustain life.The book was designed for students who are taking biology as an ancillary to first degrees. Hence, it compels its users to understand the importance of careful drawing (and/or painting). Though this may seem irritating in the beginning, it yields dividends in the end.Students are likely to appreciate its fundamental links to both anatomy and physiology. All the important life processes were discussed. But, the fact that this first edition has not been revised since (its first appearance in) 1986 makes the book a bit obsolete."
5,Homeschooling Project,"Hi, I use this book to introduce biology to my kids (9 and 11 yrs) one afternoon a week. I make three copies of the plates, we spend time together colouring, while I read and ask questions regarding the information. The kids discuss and contemplate, ask questions, make faces.. Then we take our coloured copies and paste them onto coloured cardstock. It makes for great lapbooks. I don't care if it's highschool or collegiate level. It's just meant as an introduction and a way to spend time together. I give it 4 stars for the colouring book idea, well written and thoughtful paraphrasing, plus 1 star for me and all those visual thinkers that learn from this type of educational material."
5,This coloring book for biology is excellent.,"I liked coloring in, the important structures in biology. It helped me to remember the concepts better. I also used Patrick Leonardi's ""The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations"" Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3. These study guides were great for test preparation because these were the similar questions asked on my college biology exams. I also found the biology coloring book to have great sections on DNA, Genetics, Ecology, Biology of Plants, Biology of Animals, Human Biology, Reproduction and Development. This is an excellent visual. This four books are extremely helpful for college biology."
5,Good Educational Coloring Book,"This Biology coloring book has been fantastic for my son. It is not a 'for pleasure' coloring book, although it would be for me. It is not a child's book. It is a teaching resource. Highschool to college ages will get great benenfit from this. I recommend buying a 48+ Prism color pencil set, and start enjoying yourself while learning Biology."
4,Interesting book,I have in mind my College class students when I purchase this book. I found very interesting several (not all) activities. Some are very easy and anothers are interesting.Another book with activities in the same way is from canadian Biologist Alcamo. Both area complementary.
3,coloring book,Book is a bit outdated. Not really as applicable for many of the concepts I'm teaching to though school biology students.
4,Very detailed,"It is a little too in depth for my 9th grade students, but for advanced biology students it is a great resource!"
2,Too Wordy,I found this book a bit dissapointing to use as a supplement for high school biology students. The coloring pages are too wordy and not user friendly.
2,coating scratched after two weeks,"The pan looked nice when it first came out of the package. However there are several scratches after two weeks of usage. This is not the first time I own a non-stck pan, and I have been careful with this pan. Other than that, it works fine and the handle does not heat up during the cooking."
5,Love this pan,"This is the skillet I use second most often in my kitchen. It's non-stick so usual non-stick precautions apply. Don't use metal utensils in it, be careful not to scorch anything in it, and use sponges to wash it that are made for non-stick pans.The size is perfect for a 3 egg omelet and that is what I bought it for. It works wonderfully for omelet making with a bit of butter. I have a daughter who really hated that with my other skillet about half the time, omelets became scrambled eggs instead. This one, no such issues. Turning it is never a problem, it's really very non-stick. Clean up is easy. I have a gas stove, and use it with a medium flame.Planning to buy a couple more of this series. I never thought I'd use a non-stick pan again, but I really really like this one."
1,Not worth the money,First the positive: The book does have useful information! Thus the one star.Second the book is not worth the money: It is 5 pieces of paper printed on both sides - that is including the cover. It may be worth $1 for the infomation - but not $5!I wish I would have read the previous review - before I purchased the book.
4,difficult people handling hints,Short yet interesting basic premise about not attaching to other people's foibles. Easier said than done. Good first elementary step with room for improvement on tactics.
2,Just walk away,"I expected this book to be more interesting. It was simple and ""cut to the chase"" but it did not give real insight. It was almost as if you could handle any type of person as long as you have common sense and the ability to ""just walk away"". ""Just walk away"" tends to be the theme for almost everytype of person/situation/personality that was listed in the book. I wouldnt have purchased if i knew it was going to be so vague. I would just glance through the book at the book store."
2,mediocre read,"When I read this book, it was like sitting down with my grandfather and getting simplistic advice about dealing with difficult people. The advice is not bad, it's just not great, in my opinion. Basically, for each ""type"" of difficult person, this author gives one solution of how to handle the person. The book is tiny and there is not much to it. It did not leave me with a favorable impression. I would highly recommend ""Dealing With People You Can't Stand"" by Brinkman and Kirschner instead of this little book."
1,Lame Advice At Best,"Found a copy someone tossed out. And no wonder. Weak tea. Oxman's advice to walk away from troubling people is so basic that its what every school age child is told. Strangely, he inserts little snipes at the media - a not so subtle sign that he is most likely a right-wing nut case. Then there is the ""What would the Founding Fathers think"" mini rant. I'm sure he wrote this pamphlet while wearing a tricornered hat."
