2,"if it doesn't move, it won't go in their mouths","I have leopard geckos, and if your pet is anything like my two, the rule is this: if it doesn't move, they won't eat it. If, for whatever reason, your gecko won't eat, force feeding them this stuff is nearly impossible, not to mention stressful for the little guys, so if they get sick (which mine did once--intestinal parasites from an irreputable dealer), go to the vet. What often happens is (s)he gives you a syringe (not the really pointy kind, but the plastic-tipped, somewhat wide kind), and you use what they give you (usually some protein type mix) or meat flavored baby food, if the vet says it's ok. If you don't have to force feed them, then go with live food, just as nature intended."
1,"""EMI""",Well If your gecko will eat them you can use them with the proper diet of live insects and in some cases insects and fruits.
2,Christmas Pie,This story could have been better. The charicters were cold they were not exciting.I had to strugle to keep reading it. Polly was not interesting and in my opinion a charicter such as James would not find her interesting enough to look at her twice. Their relationship was forced and lacked passion.
4,Memories from my childhood,"When I was a girl, A Candle in Her Room was actually my sister's book. There was something about it though and I really wanted to read it. Mostly because my sister and mother didn't want me to. It's a fascinating read for a kid, full of drama and magic and scares. Several generations of a family have their lives changed for better and worse because of this evil doll known as Dido. I'm an adult and I still remember the book. I recommend it to any young girl."
2,A Candle in her Room,"I read A candle in her room when I was 11 (30 years ago). I was fascinated by the character especially Dilys. I have never forgotten what a wonderful book it was - it has a bit of everything, suspense, mystery, love, romance etc. I memorised the first and final lines of the book and can you believe - I still know them (even though I do not have a copy of the book - which i would so love to have and if anyone can help me, please do). Here goes: A suppose if we had not come to Prembrokeshire, Judith, Briony and i, this story would never have been written. There would have been no Dido....... And suddenly, i felt secure an happy with a happiness I had never expected to have known. A gentle glowing happiness which burnt in side me like a clear steady flame."" How crazy is that - maybe I was touched by Dido all those years back and I'm still captivated!"
2,This book TERRIFIED me.,"I love reading everyone else's review of the book, especially the differences in reaction at different ages. I was about 9 or 10 when I read it and was terrified. I had a plaster-of-paris dog I made in class and after that book I decided it was evil too and threw it in my father's country home dug-out pond. I would never go near the pond again for fear that the heavy dog would have ""floated"" to the surface to continue haunting me.I think this book would be better suited to the library of a jr. high school, rather than elementary."
1,At Day 2 you come to a screeching halt,"The book and the code you download from Sam's website is based on a Pointbase embedded database, but Java J2EE now comes with a Derby database, so you aren't able to create and install your database. I suppose this book would work as a reference manual for some things, but you definitely won't be able to teach yourself much."
1,This Book is Obsolete (0 star rating),"The book's case studies, code and build files assume that J2EE 1.4 comeswith the PointBase database server. J2EE 1.4 currently only comes bundled with the Derby database server. As a result, the book is useless. Emails to the publisher failed to resolve the problem."
1,"Complete, no.","If you follow the directions for loading the software ""included"" you will have problems. I hope the content is better.1. The J2EE SDK is not included on the CD. The J2SE SDK is. Why?2. The installation instructions are for three different OSs. They are jumbled, rather than covering one OS and going to the next. It's a mess.3. Path length limitations for Windows 2000 are not addressed. Follow their directions for the JAVA_HOME path and you get nothing, unless you are very lucky. Granted the book is not about windows but the installation instructions should be correct and complete.Maybe the content will get better but if you can't get there then what good is it. Just get a reference manual."
5,Great Puzzle!,"My baby received this as a gift and played with it for hours upon opening it. The animals are printed under the puzzle piece, making it easier for him to put them back into the right spot. Plus the knobs on the pieces make great chew toys! Really nice puzzle!"
4,its cool,It is a good picture the only flaw I find in it is that I thought it would be bigger than it actually was
3,"Nice pic, for its size","This is a nice picture, but it is hard to capture that much on such a small print. it is my own fault for buying it, (it has the demensions right on the title of the product!) but i was underwhelmed by it. I plan on purchesing another print of this photograph at some point. at least a 64-24 though. to put it in perspective, this is half the size of a standard 2x3 poster..."
1,Missing,"We ordered this print, unframed, almost THREE MONTHS ago. We have been in touch with the company, and they have promised to send a second one but we still have not received anything. Very disappointed with this seller."
2,Eh..,"It was okay, It wasn't worth the money in my opinion, I actually have this and the full size and I found that I enjoyed the full size more, and it seemed to be better packaged."
5,nyc love,i love nyc and this is a small long poster i can pput in my workspace area its good size for decoration
4,Nice,Great print but don't let ad pics fool you its smaller then what it looks like but still very nice..
5,Framed and All,"This item took a while but it was due to the mail, not the company. I contacted and they responded promptly letting me know that they had already replaced the destroyed one and the new one was on it's way. I really like the view. It's framed already and hanging on my wall. : )"
1,EZ hang poster frame,I bought this with the EZ hang poster frame and when it arrived there was no frame just the print. Why would I be charged extra for something that I did not receive? I was very disappointed
5,very cute,"I purchased it for the title and was not disappointed. It is a fun read over and over, would recommend."
5,Wow!,"The first time I saw Aaron Watson and the Orphans of the Brazos, he was opening up for Roger Creager in my hometown. Aaron has been back 3 times since then, and I haven't missed a show! I love good country music (NOT the pop crap that passes for country all to often recently), and this music is some of the best country I've ever heard. Aaron's voice and songwriting ability AMAZE me, and the rest of his band is a huge pool of talent as well. [go Haystack!] Definately buy this!"
1,"Look for another way to ""reinvent"" your kitchen","I was expecting this book to have some instructions or tips for remodeling a kitchen, or advice about different gadgets I could install, or show decorative objects I could display, but it is mostly a book on instructions for cutesy little projects. However, unlike the other reviewers, I was neither charmed or nor inspired. These are projects you can find in most other non-kitchen books on interior decoration. If the photos were great, that would make up for the lack of substantive information, but they are not. My recommendation is to skip this book."
1,junk,"The product was shoddy.Upon assembly, one can see the fabric is slapped together.It is very light in weight. Indicating cheap (thin) wood.The battery holder was almost impossible to get the batteries in and moved about. I was afraid I was going to break it, while installing the batteries.It didn't work. I thought maybe it was my batteries. Nope. It flat out didn't work.We returned this item."
4,RPG,"A game in which you can be a whole different sort of ecological warrior. If someone disagrees with your take on the environment, you can get angry, get furry, and rip their guts out. Of course, that may not make you too popular with your tribe if you do that indiscriminately, and they are strong and furry too.You are a warrior fighting corruption and the Wyrm."
4,Great buy,"All of Hed Khandi's stuff is good. It reminds me of the naked music label. This is a nice set of vocal, chill tracks to lounge back to. The second CD has an Ibiza influance which I can take it or leave it, lots of spanish beat tracks. Im not a fan of that so the 4 stars."
1,Over-rated Fretboard Roadmaps,"This book claims to be of great help to those wishing to learn more about playing the dobro or lap steel guitar. The cover has some very nice artwork and looks great on your coffee table.The cd that comes with the book is not put together very well. It is difficult to hear the dobro parts being played. When trying to follow the book along with the cd it is almost impossible to be sure of what part you are hearing.If I were a professional musician I'm sure it would be a walk in the park to make use of the book. For a novice, it has little value."
1,Total trash,"If you want to play blues steel guitar in a heavy metal band this dobro book is for you. Otherwise forget it. Book is useless and the CD is even worse. Breifly touches on the G scale then hints at how to do the rest. CD consists of short lines of heavily distorted electric guitar and steel guitar music. What happened to the DOBRO? Oh yes, I think I heard four or five notes from one in there somewhere. I am learning much more with a fretboard chart bought on an online auction we all know of for a few bucks. One star cause there's no zero,or better yet,negative."
2,"Humorous in parts, interesting characters, weak story line.","The plot was interesting, here was a guy who was a psychic andwanted a woman to fall in love with him FOR him while not shying awayfrom his psychic abilities being a part of him. The other characters, including his love interest, was excellently described so you could enjoy their personality nuances ... and laugh at some of the side characters introduced in. But then the story falls apart and you get a feeling of being rushed, and questioning some parts (i.e. the dentist's over night change that seemed to come from no where and basically went no where in the story), and ... well, I don't recommend it at a full price buying purchase. It is an OK book to toss in for reading while in a car or something but not one that you will want to keep on your bookshelf to re-read at a later date."
2,Vision with out substance,The Clairvoyant by M. Thurm was a breezy easy to read tale. It was well written with clearly defined charactors. Thats were it ends. The love story for the main charactors seemed more transparent than any ghost in the book. It seemed rushed and without real emotional depth. The subplot was better actually. I cared more about lucy's story. But when the end of the book comes its abrupt and harsh because the subplot which stays unresolved ruins the main love story. Ms. Thurm is a good writer she needs to work on story telling... I see it happening...
4,Bought a gift for a UW Grad,"Bought this game for my dad who plays Monopoly with my family and I when he visits... and since he is a University of Wisconin, Madison graduate, I just had to get him this game when I saw it on Amazon.I had it shipped right to his home, so I have never played it. I presume that it is more of a ""conversation piece"" in his den/office?Buying from Amazon was quick, easy and efficient... and this game was unique for the guy/dad that already has and owns everything... but this is one thing he did not have!!!Have never played the game... but from a unique point of view, I am glad I bought it for him."
1,Do not depend on sizing...it's Wrong!,"Small is supposed to fit a dog/puppy 10-12"" from collar to tail....NOT! The sweater measures close to ten inches from end to end and between the leg holes it is three inches. Based on measurements of 10-12 it should have fit my pup but the diameter is way small...only if you pup/dog is very small, don't order this sweater. It's cute but size wise it is a let down."
5,Muy Bien!,"After two months of daily use at the gym, I can say I'm very happy with my iAudio G2. The sound quality is great, I like the form factor, and it fits perfectly in the $10 Cordura waistband case I stumbled on at Fry's (local electronics store). The earbuds keep falling off, but I'm not holding iAudio accoutable for that.Highly recommeded."
5,Excellent tome on seminal topic,"Although several of the world's major religions have, at various moments in my life, seemed worthy and tenable, I seem always to return to the sort of fatalistic world view epitomized by the agnostic cosmologist. The work of Adair Butchins lays out an orderly and well-considered review of the effects of our ever-widening universal perspective and the vast leaps in human knowledge that have occurred since the Big 3 religions gained an audience. ""Old"" does not necessarily mean ""false"", but neither does it mean ""true"", know what I mean?"
2,one word....,"terrible! Where did he find this ""singer?"" Avoid this at all costs, people!!!!!! It stinks, is terrible, and, in short, being kind, sucks!"
2,Ugh! What taste? Where is it?,"Don't expect to get anything useful out of this book other than a good chuckle at all money and no taste. Unbelievably poor.Not only that but all the stars are two bit or less celebrities.The rooms are dated and in hideous taste, the stars are obscure, the design details are revolting and these are 40 rooms I would never want to live in.Admittedly some are less repulsive than others but on the whole, don't spend the money.Not a great deal of bio on the celebs, this book is useful as a curiosity only.Kotori 2004"
2,Project Procurement Management Primer,"If you have never seen or managed a procurement process for resources, this book is a good overview of some of the challenges you may face and processes to follow.However if you have any experience and are looking for a resource to help you build best practices around Project Procurement I would look for another resource that has more depth."
3,Too Expensive,"This textbook is required for one of my classes. I was surprised to see that the Amazon price is much more than my college bookstore, over $20 higher. For once I saved money on Campus. Usually I come to amazon to save money on textbooks."
4,Provides an Introduction to the Basics of TV Production,"Television production has changed markedly in the past few years we're told in the introduction. With equipment dropping in price, more sophisticated equipment is available to more people. While the technology changes some of the elements of producing a show, other features of the process remain the same. In this well-written book, Professor Fielding covers the basics quite thoroughly.In the opening chapter, a definition of television production is given and expanded upon. The medium is a communication tool and to be used effectively one must know what it can and cannot do. Television distorts reality, effective producers alter it for the desired effect.This book introduces readers to the key terms and procedures. I consider it to be an asset that it is smaller than other TV production books. Readers are not burdened with information overload."
5,Unobliterated Bliss,"Amazing! The words, the music, the irony! This album is as surprising as it is satisfying. Buy two, they're small."
2,"Repetitive, with no clear guidance","Having been diagnosed with diabetes recently at a local clinic but unable to meet with a dietitian, I was hoping this book would help guide me in creating a diet/meal plan for myself. It had a lot of good information and tips that will definitely be helpful, but I was hoping for more. I was hoping it would guide me through the process of designing a customized plan. It wasn't at all like this. On top of that, it was extremely repetitive. Good, just not what I was expecting from the title and product description."
2,useless book,"if you want a book that tells you adding sugar is OK, they you might find this book to be acceptable. There are some good points in the book, but you can find those on the web.Why would you need to see the Wendy's McDonald's menus? This book seems to think you eat there.There's better books out there, pass on this one."
3,Basic,Basic information that follows ADA guidlines. If you are really interested in knowing how to control BG with diet and exercise without medications you won't find it here.
3,I had fun,"The usual trouble for me with ""Tribute"" programs are when the honoree performs and it becomes a bit self serving. That being said, this show was good not because the maestro appeared to be enjoying himself(he clearly was)but because of the energy of the performances,particularly Gal Costa.I'm not a Herbie Hancock fan but he did a serviceable job conducting the proceedings.I like my jazz old school and some of the improv was a touch too avant garde from the younger guys. While an avid Jobim lover,I wouldn't suggest rushing out to get this one,but it's makes a nice addition for your musical DVD library."
3,Strange but maybe true,This is a strange but informative book. Seagram and Universal's problems in Hollywood are well known but you would think everything is sweetness and light from reading this book. For instance praise is heaped upon the skills of Universal ceo Frank Biondi now departed and blamed (rightly) for many of the problems. That casts problems of the credibility of the rest of the book. In it Edgar Bronfman is portrayed as a good common sense businessman who has done wonders for Seagram. This is probably true but had he been a little more honest about the Universal problems then the rest of the book would have stood up a lot better. Well worth reading however for the insider insights it contains.
5,ESTUPENDA PRODUCCION MUSICAL,maravilloso grupo musical dominicano muy recomendable para bailar aunque ya este grupo se desintegro pienso que todo buen coleccionista debe tener este cd.
3,It has valuable information which is poorly organized,"The book covers a topic badly in need of a comprehensive text. This book seems to be a dump of information by the author with no successful attempt to organize it well. Large blocks of text with no subheadings and inadequate figures make the material confusing to someone who does not understand the material beforehand. References to radiometry are a disaster. In one paragraph on page 95 there are no less than five separate mistakes. The confusion between radiance and irradiance is total. On the other hand, in the absence of any other text, the book is a valuable and complete reference on the use of ray-trace analysis in optical design."
2,"Useful content, but not well organized.","This book coves the subject of optical design in detail. The content is good, and comprehensive. However, the material is not well organized. Some of the material is too theoretical, and not related to practical problems."
5,Wow...,That's all I can say. Didn't expect it to be that good... just wanted to relax and watch something. I can't believe I hadn't heard of this movie.
5,Can't wait to see it,"This is actually Karen Woods writing this not my husband Bobby L. I just recently discovered Tom Hardy and only seen a few of his films. His acting ability is on the level of a Russell Crowe, no matter what character Russell is playing he inhabits that role and I find Tom Hardy is making me feel the same about him."
5,Powerful and Emotional,"I don't write reviews often, but I felt compelled to do so for Warrior. However, I don't feel compelled to spoil, pretend to be `Siskel or Ebert' or write a novel on the experience, so I'll keep my sentiments short but sweet! I agree that the spirit of Warrior is about much more than sports, MMA or fighting for glory. Warrior was gripping, moving and inspirational, simply one hell of a film!!!!"
5,great movie!!!,"Emotional, kind of transparent story line but i still get choked up at a few parts. heart tugging action packed fight themed film. well done great camera work and very realistic fight scenes. i enjoyed it very much"
4,Gotta love the underdog,Pretty well written and very well acted. It wasn't my favorite Tom Hardy work but the guy who played the teacher was fantastic. I didn't know him from anything else and I think that goes a long way. Most importantly the fighting was believable and fantastic.
5,I loved this,I love the Rocky series. I've seen it more times than I know. I also love Girl Fight. This movie moved me beyond expectation. I loved it.
5,Warrior,Warrior has to be one of the best fighting action packed movie I have seen in a real long time. I like the sibling rivalry and how the story unfolded. The plot was well organized and it is like nothing you would expect. Great movie!
3,Eh....,It seems the disk only works in one of my blu ray players for some reason. Won't even load into the one in my living room... Very strange.
3,"Action-Packed and Masculine, But Not as Deep as it Thinks it is","Just your run-of-the-mill Hollywood sports movie, it's disappointingly static and mostly predictable with an armload of blatant plot holes. It does deserve credit for bucking convention in a few ways, particularly in building to the inevitable finale with two potentially viable results. Typically the happy ending writes itself halfway through the picture and then just goes through the motions to get us there: in Warrior, we follow both perspectives for the whole of the film and either outcome would make for an appropriate, warm ride into the sunset. The fight scenes are fun, if highly exaggerated, takes on an in-vogue sport; it's about as realistic a portrayal of mixed martial arts as Rocky and The Replacements were to boxing and pro football. Nick Nolte deserves special mention for grizzling up and embracing his inner Burgess Meredith, but I didn't see anything above and beyond from leading men Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton."
4,"Good story, weak ending","I liked the story building up to the final fight, and was torn between who should win. I don't want to give away the ending, but I thought the final scene left you hanging without showing how the loose ends got resolved."
3,ending is complete BS,totally unbelievable storyline and was exaggerated to such that I felt sick after the movie ended. Don't waste your time watching this garbage.
3,Punch drunk,"A UFC movie about bruddas from the neighborhood with hard luck stories and hearts o'gold. One's a physics teacher and the other's a war hero, both spawned by Nick Nolte, a wife-bashing drunk who has seen the light. A lunk head's dream. It goes on and on and on until it milks every white-trash mythology that can be crammed into a PG-13 thug fest with the Chuck Norris seal of approval. It makes just about any Jean Claude Van Damme movie from the eighties look like CITIZEN KANE."
5,Great Movie,I thought that this movie was tremendous. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Simply put.....5 out of 5 stars. You will not be disappointed.
4,A Moving Film....,"A heartfelt film about a dysfunctional family. Well done.This is America, impotent,weak, misguided and lost.Courage, honesty and honor are words that are no longer associated with this land of filth."
5,Great Flick,All I can say is this was a great movie! Even if not a UFC fan movie has great story to it.
5,Great movie,must see for any onegreat story and acting is amazing love this movie so much this is a must have
5,extremely underrated,"This movie was pretty incredible. Excellent acting, sweet story and amaaaaaaaaazing fight scenes. Sooo bummed it didn't do better at the box office. A MUST SEE!!!!"
3,SEVERAL DIRECTORIAL FAILURES,"I like this movie, but it is no where near five stars because of several directorial and editing flaws. Example, when the sportscaster says that Brendan is being thrown like a rag doll . . . well, it is a ""rag doll,"" and it is obvious. Example, when Brendan is leaving his friend's gym office, the transition from inside to outside the office is very bad. Example, when Brendan is seen on a monitor screen reacting to the fact that his brother will not quit even though his shoulder is separated, it does not work. The emotional ride, I think, blinds people to errors that hurt the movie severely. This could have been a AAA movie, but because of several directorial and editing errors, it is a B movie. That it is rated 8.2 on IMDB amazes me."
5,five star,"I do not even remember the last time I saw a movie with no bad guys. I watched this movie because I had never seen a movie with so many 5 star ratings, worth it."
5,A great story and a great movie,Tom Hardy is becoming a hell of an actor. I guess it helps when you star in a movie that has a great story and great fight sequences.
4,nice,"Good movie. Could have done more at the end, but good. Good story line, not one of those boxing or wrestling movies that there are so many of. Keeps your interest. I really enjoyed it :)"
5,One of the Greatest Movies EVER,Powerful drama. Storytelling at its best. And I don't like ANY kind of fighting or violence. The family dynamics and the healing that takes place is so profound. Highly recommend this.
5,Intense,"I figured this would be just another ""Rocky"", but I was surprised. It was very good. Edge of your seat fight sequences. Right up there with Cinderella Man."
5,More realistic and moving than ROCKY,"Great story, good acting, interesting characters. realistic fighting choreography. Two brothers, one a physics teacher and family man fighting to win the 5 million dollar prize to keep his family's home. The other, an atheistic ex marine gone awol due to his entire unit getting wiped out by friendly fire. Fighting to win the money and give it to the widow and children of one his fallen comrades and best friend. And their former abusive alcoholic father struggling to stay sober and change his ways and redeem himself to his sons. Very moving and uplifting film."
5,Watch it!,"Best fighting movie I've seen in a long time. All the acting was great. Great story, almost cried at the end. Great movie!"
4,Best Movie of 2011,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, Warrior centers around two estranged brothers, highly skilled at mma who enter a tournament with a seven figure cash prize. Both have different reasons for why they entered but both won't quit. A solid cast and a cameo from Kurt Engle make this very watchable. I'm very annoyed that it was overlooked at the Oscars though."
1,where's ZERO??,"I wanted to like this movie. But every cliche was here in the first five minutes. I wanted to be brought into the love of the sport, as in ""Rocky"" or even the ""Wrestler."" please, your best bet is to watch a documentary on Rocky Marciano, which can be uploaded with the director's cut for three bucks. It was a much better movie! what's WITH movies today? are we all so stupid that any garbage they throw at us is enough as long as SOME of it sticks to the wall--or someone lies for their own purposes and TELLS us how great their movie is??? I also was to say that the female vocalist in the promo was irrelevant and it sounded either off or dated already. It didn't have anything to do with the movie. Very incongruous."
1,A Confusing Stupid Mess of a Movie,"Nick Nolte looked about as confused as I was at the end of this stupid, mixed up movie, seemingly written but a bunch of monkees in a barrell. That it actually got positive reviews confirms my belief that humanity is on the eve of destruction. Made no sense, provided no insight into character, motivation, etcetera, start to finish. A BAD movie."
5,off-topic - HUONG's contact,"Henry,Sadly this is the only way for me to get you back. I lost the huongbordeaux account about 5 months ago. Write me at huongqpham at gmail dot com to wish me a happy new yearAnd, pls delete this entry once you've got meH."
4,GOOD,"I always buy Saw Palmetto 540 mg 250 Caps by Swanson PremiumSwanson Premium Brand for my father's enlarged prostate, this supplement is very good,"
4,climate science isn't boring!,"Thin Ice by Mark Bowen is a great story, well told. The book captures the excitement of experimental climate science and the extremely hard work that it entails. Anyone who likes books about scientific endeavors will enjoy this book. After reading it I understood the arguments about climate change much better than I used to. Unfortunately, the bottom line is pretty grim. The author is both a scientist and an alpine climber. Climbers take the loss of the glaciers very personally, and this book, while not being weepy or overly political, imparts the message that humans urgently need to confront the issue of climate change."
5,A Book for the President,"Michael Levin has already written a superb review of Mark Bowen's book. President Bush should read this book, then reconsider his support of the Kyoto Accord."
4,Always raises my spirits.,"Alot of my Cd collection Is dark(Darkthrone,Burzum)Depressing(Skinny puppy,wumpscut)Angry(black flag,Slayer) and Heavy and fast(Agoraphobic nosebleed, exhumed) But This album and other BS albums Are always a breath of fresh air. With light lyrics about love,freindship(Manthem is the ultimate drinking song when your with the guys) and BMX bikes Its hard to be in a frumpy mood listening to them. Its fun,Its up beat and If you don't want to get up and jump around or dance. You might be dead."
4,"Hear the record, Experience their show!","Easily one of my favorite CDs that I own. I love almost all of the songs here. There concert's always have a fair amount of these songs being play, so if your going to go to their show get this CD and remember every word. P.S. Gold Record = alright, Anchors Aweigh = Great, Hopeless Romantic (and all earlier work) = AWESOME."
5,"""No one could beat us, we drink beer and wear Adidas!""","Every song on this CD is brilliant, fun, and quirky. As testament to their greatness, the Bouncing Souls pull of even the silliest songs, such as their ode to their bike, with poignancy. This may be their greatest work, though Anchors Away ranks about par.They are my absolute favorite band, and they offer a DISTINCT SOUND in the punk genre."
4,More good tunes...,"Well, this album continues in the footsteps of Hopeless Romantic. These guys keep pumping out good albums, and though they're all linked, they have a sound that distinguishes them all. I just got this today so I can't really describe the distinguishing factor here, but I can say that if you like the Soul's you'll like this, and if you liked Hopeless Romantic especially, this will be up your alley. Catchy poppy punk courtesy of the Bouncing Souls! Can't go wrong with Greg's voice, c'mon now."
5,It's Greeeat!,"This album is truly amazing, i listen to it over and over again and never seem to get tired of it. Some of the best Bouncing Soul's tracks are on this album. If you don't own this disk, do yourself a favour and pick it up as soon as possible!"
3,Decent record,"This album doesn't quite match ""Hopeless Romantic"" in terms of variety and songwriting but it is still a decent album. The production quality seems lower than on ""Hopeless"" and there aren't any killer songs that jump out at you instantly. I'd still recommend it though because the songs will have you singing along with the choruses. And like the other reviewer said, Greg's voice is so cool, it's intoxicating."
3,i'm like everyone else...i wanna like it but...,"it's hard too! there are some songs on the new album that are good but then some that just aren't that great! i first heard some of the tunes from this album last year live and i liked what i heard but then there was a longgggg wait for the album and then when i heard it i was letdown. many people seem to either love or hate the last one, i personally love it and feel that it's their most complete album without any filler...well maybe the last tune! the new album has filler galore with a few standout tracks like the something special, manthem, private radio, gone and late bloomer! also the souls are going a little too poppy for my tastes and it looks like the way they will continue to go! but hey...if the record doesn't appeal to you they always entertain at their live shows and play what you want to hear! steal this record, borrow it and burn it but don't buy it! the souls have earned my respect and money but not with this one!"
2,why the hype?,"I have been pondering that for a good while. I think this is the 1st real punk record i own that I REALLY dislike. Both the lyrics and the music is lacking. It seems all the songs start out with that Greg guy's annoying voice babbling about God knows what or some stupid sounding guitar jingle at the beginning. See some bands can get away with all the songs sounding the same, which is a very RARE occasion, but the Bouncing Souls get one medicore sounding song (at it's very utmost potential) and somehow manipulate it into generic sounding noise and duplicate it 13 or so times. Maybe some of thier early releases might be better but I'm not gonna take the risk of making the mistake of purchasing something like this again. I've heard this recording all the way through once and I've come to one comclusion : You don't need to step in crap twice to know it stinks."
2,Needs to be improved,I went to see Green day in concert last december and Bouncing souls were their support band.And they sounded really good so i decided to get the album and i was dissapointed.Every song is miserable apart from tracks 5 and 6 which are decent rock songs. I thought they were going to be the next Green Day well they could be if they can do more songs like tracks 5 and 6.
5,Happy Jon,"This item is no different from the one I bought from the big boxes (L--es & HDepot)except for cost. It works the same. Only the cost was 2/3 the cost at the local establishment and the shipping was free. Where can that price be matched. I only wish someone was selling cars this way. (hint,hint) This is not be first time with this type saving on items purchased through amazon. Please don't ever close."
4,ALBUM IS A TRIBUTE TO RIVERS BLUES INFLUENCES.,"GREAT TO HEAR THE NEW AND OLD MATERIAL ON ONE ALBUM, AND HEAR HIS VOICE IS AS GOOD AS EVER!"
5,Rivers is back and better than ever,"I listen to and enjoy all kinds of music. I find that rarely does any artist release a CD where virtually every track is good. ""Last Train to Memphis"" by Johnny Rivers is, quite honestly, the best new release by any artist that I have heard in years. The #1 track ""House of Blues"" is Johnny Rivers at his best. From there on, right to the very last track ""Blue Suede Blues"" the entire CD is a enjoyable listening experience. ""Chicago Bound"" is a bluesy R&B Rocker that really gets those feet tapping and head bopping from beginning to the end. ""Closer to You"" is full of feeling and expression Johnny does so well. ""Uphill peace of Mind, Don't let the Rain Come Down and Gypsy Wind"" are chart topper material. This is an outstanding CD. A must have. I give this one Five stars."
5,Fine CD,I totally agree with Dave...bought this Cd back in 99 and it's a winner....Johnny Rivers has a ton of soul...Very good CD that will surprise you....Classify this as Memphis Blues/rock that has both upbeat and mellow tunes....
3,Comfortable but do not wear well...,I have had a pair of these for a few months now and really like to wear them. They are easy to slip on and are quite comfortable. A great shoe except for the fact that they are starting to wear on the inside heel after only three months of use. I have had a lot better results with my previous shoes from Clark. Most of my Clarks have lasted at least a couple of years. These will be luck to make it through 8 months.
3,Tracklist,"1 The Corrido Twist- EXOTICS2 My Woodie- SATAN'S PILGRIMS3 Custom Caravan- SURF TRIO4 Suspense Run- BRODIE, Mark & BEAVER PATROL5 Hot Rod Alley- SURFDUSTERS6 Competition Coupe- BOSS MARTIANS7 The Outlaw- BOMBORAS8 Midnight Rider- WOODIES9 RPM TRASHMATICS"
2,alright but not great,"This game is ok. It isn't fun but it isn't terrible. In my opinion, there are better games out there and this one should be saved for when you run out of other games. Not a lot of fun, but somewhat educational, because it is trivia"
3,Playstation Game System Carrying Case,"The playstation game system carrying case is one of the best carrying cases there is. It will protect the playstation system you have in it really good, and i'm not lieing either. Its hard body is really strong and will garuntie the safty of the system in it. So i would advise you to get this case.Thanx for Reading this."
5,Another #1 at home,"This was one in a decade of UK #1s. Unfortunately, oasis have suffered from Cliff Richard syndrome this decade (D'You Know What I Mean?). ""Won't Let You Down"" still has that Beatles influence the press hype over. Released in the UK and Eire by Big Brother/Vital and Europe by Helter Skelter/Sony BMG. No domestic release here, as usual."
4,Documate scanner,"Our office uses the Documate to scan patient's charts, explanations of benefits & other misc. paper communications. We successfully scan over 800 pcs daily w/out any problems.The Documate is fast, reliable and priced @ a good value."
2,"OK scanner, limited lifetime","I've had this scanner for almost three years, and it worked well for about two and a half years and has been more or less impossible to use since then. Like that of another reviewer, the roller on my machine now fails to grip pages (in fact, it fails to turn at all in some circumstances). Scans of more than one page don't work.The upside is that we used this scanner for a couple of years where it worked more or less flawlessly, over the course of easily thousands of pages. Even so, an $800 machine should last more than two years before being felled by an (apparently common) mechanical failure."
1,Don't be fooled by this one!,"If you are a true Rage fan than this will be of now use to you. It is not music, but a somewhat cheesy biography about the band with a few snippets of Tom and Brad, and I stress ""a few"". I am disapointed with A.com for not providing more info. It is also unauthorized. Stay Away!"
4,A Good Basic Biography Of Rage,"This is a fairly well put together basic biography of Rage Against the Machine intended for fans who wish to learn more about them. Although it doesn't contain many new facts that will interest hardcore fans, its good for new to moderate ones who just want a general overview. Some especially interesting tracks are Chicano Child, a breif overview of Zack's fascinating childhood, and Saturday Night Censor, which is about Rage's brief appearance on Saturday Night Live. I recommend this biography to new to moderate Rage fans, although no hardcore fan's Rage collection is complete without it."
5,Best relaxation recording I've found,"I originally bought the cassette version back in the 1980s and used it off and on for about 15 years--until it eventually wore out. When I started having increased anxiety recently (mainly due to job worries) I went on line to find the CD or downloadable version. It is working as well as I remember from the 80s and 90s. It gets me to sleep and helps me stay asleep, as well as helping me during the day when I feel stressed, as I form an ""O"" with the thumb and fore finger.....It's like having an old friend back in my life after a long absence."
5,magical vision,"This is a delightful book-totally whimsical, great illustrations, and a super-fun deviation from standard ""sweet"" new baby fare. Get it for friends of new baby girls!! it will be a favorite."
2,Black Titan: A.G. Gaston and the Making of a Black American Millionaire,"Actually most of the information from this book was taken from Green Power ( written by the man himself) and the rest was stretched. Actually, I know the authors. Neither of them truly new him and as far being related, they were nieces only by marriage. I just think they are trying to make a quick buck on something that they know nothing about."
5,TRUE ORGINAL,"I read this book with fasination.The Richness of both Mr.Gastons life story and the his CRITICAL role in the civil rights movement which is NEVER told,is beyond astounding!Before Oprah Winfrey, Before Tyler Perry, even BEFORE John Johnson(Founder of EBONY Magazine, there was Mr.A.G Gaston!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This should be required reading for ALL americans, especially African-Americans."
4,Winner of A.G Gaston Spelling Bee,"As a child I participated in and won the A.G. Gaston spelling bee on the state level two years in a row (1957-1958). It was a stepping stone for me and enabled me to go on and do more rewarding things as an adult. I remember staying in his motel in Birmingham with my sponsor and god mother, Mrs Tempie Horton. This is a piece of history that I share with my grand kids. My name is (maiden) Lois Jean Scott and I attended Calvary Jr. high school in Huntsville, Alabama. I am grateful for Mr Gaston and his wife, whom I met on several occasions, for giving me this opportunity."
4,Spirit of Reiki ~Guna Sangah,This music is very good for relaxation....Has been accepted as music that brings a sense of peace during my Reiki sessions.
2,Very Difficult to Listen Too,"I've given this CD the old college try and it just doensn't work for me. The voice is not calming or hypnotic in anyway and there is no background music to sooth you. Even if the voice was ok, he just talks to darn much for anyone to enter any form of hypnotic trance. I've also tried some online podcast and Glenn Harrold's stuff and greatly prefer both of those."
1,"Self Hypnosis for diet,","I didn't like the promotion contend,.I tryed and it doesn't do a thing for me.I haven't lost any weight. so in the drawer it goes.Julia Da Vico"
4,Helpful!,"I use this program two or three times a day. It definitely has helped me to focus on my weight loss goals and PERSEVERE. I relax when I am listening to it, so it has helped me to limit ""emotional eating"" when I am under stress. This is not a quick fix but with this program I am making long-term changes to my mindset and lifestyle. I find it easier to use (and less expensive!) than group meetings."
2,Couldn't get past the voice,"I felt there were some positive aspects to this CD program. If only the author had paid for someone else to read it. The voice was rather high pitch, and nearly unbearable to listen to. All in all, there are better audios out there to put one in a hypnotice state. This was had almost too much talk to be effectively relaxing."
5,"Lost weight, started sleeping better","I have been using these CD's for a couple of months now. My weight is gradually dropping, which is what I wanted and expected. The surprise has been that in the aftermath of a highly stressful change in my life, the hypnosis sessions are helping me to reduce anxiety and to sleep better. I love the emphasis on a healthy lifestyle."
2,distracting clicking on the cd's,There is a very distracting clicking noise on the cd's that while your are listening and relaxing in the hypnotic state it bring you out. I found it very irritating and therefore the process isn't useful to me. I just wonder if anyone else had this problem and how it affected their hypnotic state.
3,The self-hypnosis diet,"I thought the wording was good. I have to agree with others who reviewed it, that his voice is not soothing and sometimes gets in the way. At times his voice was clear but during the hypnosis session his voice would lower and sound a little garbled. If you can get past that, it is a good book/cd."
3,A little disappointed..,"I had high hopes that these cds would help me get my mind in the proper frame, but so far they have not. It may just be me. They are very relaxing and I will continue to use them in hopes that there will be some cumulative effect. I do enjoy listening and will continue to do so....they are worth a try..."
2,Annoying Voice,"I could not get past the voice to enjoy the CD. Too fast? Loud? Tone? I have a collection of meditation cd's, self-help, etc, and this one is just not easy to listen to and absorb."
2,The self hynosis diet,The quality is good. It doesn't have the same cover. All in all is very boring no music or subliminal is some talking in the monotone voice.
1,Very disappointing....,"I own quite a few self-hypnosis CDs and I am a strong believer in the power of the mind and of self-hypnosis...I bought this item and gave it a few chances...: sorry, no disrespect to the author or to the other reviewers but it is rubbish!: too much talking, not enough affirmations, very unpleasant voice (rather irritating to be honest!) and too fast...what a waste of money...I do respect that other people have a different opinion about it, fair enough, but this is my personal review and I would certainly not recommend this item to anyone.to Amazon staff : would it be possible in the near future to be able to listen to self-hypnosis CD, just like we can for other CDs, please?"
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this product on the strength of the other review and because I was looking for a cheap camera that would take decent photos. Unfortunately, my 15 dollar drug store digital takes better photos than this little guy. I read all the directions and checked to make sure I wasn't making mistakes, but in the end, I had to admit I had purchased in haste. The camera has no low light capabilities (all photos taken in house were dark), pictures taken outside had sun glare, and the digital zoom is not really helpful for close ups. It's really a camera for those who don't really care about the quality of their pictures."
1,Poppycock,"As is typical of all of D. James Kennedy's writings and speeches, this one is full of poppycock too. To come to the conclusions that he has come to in this book, one would have to totally and completely ignore the facts of history.That,sadly, is what the so called Christian Reconstructionists, of which the ""Rev"" Kennedy is a member, do all the time. To the rest of us, that is referred to as being a Liar for Jesus. That is not what real Christians should do however, but Kennedy shows no conscience when it comes to that however and that is truly the sad part."
5,Beward Ungodly Country,Am reading it now. Everyone in this country should read and take heed as it shows what our roots are and why we have been prosperous versus all the secularism and forgotten God that many in our nation adhere to. He has stopped blessing us because we no longer follow him.
5,Exceptional,"This fantastic read is only one of many that the author wrote. It is backed up with excellent research by a top notch writer and academic. This book and ""what if Jesus had never been born"" as well as many others are favorite additions to my personal library."
2,"Flawed book, but readable","Dr. Kennedy analyzes American history using the Bible. However, his research and conclusions are flawed. I will admit that I agree with some of the points he makes, as I am a Christian.However, I do not believe for one second that America ever was a Christian nation. Having read several books on the subject, including Kennedy's, I came to the conclusion that the founding fathers wanted the freedom to practice religion in the privacy of their homes and churches, and not to have the state dictate to them what they could and could not believe. Jon Meacham's excellent book ""American Gospel"" is a much better researched book than Kennedy's fundamentalist views on what America should be like."
5,not bad....,Hey this product is very nice.... it fits just right...no problems and the material in this product is excellent..... just be careful when you put it on for the first time... don't pull it too tight... it makes a difference..... other than that.... it excellent so get it....
2,I see...,"This book should be titled Language: In the Verse of Stereo Instructions. Simple grammatical concepts are overcomplicated and underexplained. I really don't need lessons in foreign languages, while trying to understand the English Language. The only reason I am using this book is because it is required by the university I attend. I think professors should find a better text for students."
1,Too much Christian religion. Not much psychology.,"This must be a Vanity Publication. Surely no self-respecting publisher would print this. It's all about Bible verses and going to church. If this helps someone OK, but it sure didn't help me."
3,facing lonliness,It would have been nice had anything written about the book had told me it was a VERY Christian book. I needed material for a group on lonliness at our not for porfit mental health agency which is not a Christian agency and our population is VERY diverse. I am not allowed to use material from any one religious group - so it was useless to me.
5,Excellent book!,"I read this book for my dissertation lit review and I loved it! It helps you understand how Jews have been seen as both occidental and oriental. Given that Jews historically have played this ""middle position"" between the oppressed and the ruling classes, it is not surprising that Jews have been ""both/and."""
2,Philosophy of Religion by Rowe,"I bought the book used, but it was underlined almost on every other page with a marker in a very abnormal way of doing it. The highligt used was heavy pink, at some point that some writting is difficult to read. For the price I paid i rather get a new one for few dollars more. Philosophy of religion is the book, by Rowe."
2,Too Strong for me,"The pills must do what they say, but this pills were very strong so I kept having issues when I taked them, even taking them with food makes your stomach hurt a little bit...... And your urine gets very very dark color, and that is a little bit crazy since I only drink water it used to be very clear so I think is too much for my body.... I'll stay with CENTRUM....."
4,Pretty good from C-Bo,"C-Bo returns once again with another album. Heavily featuring many other artists on it (only 4 of the 16 don't have anyone else on them), it still is a good album, not his best but still good. Has about 4 songs that I skip, a few alright ones, and about 7 high quality ones. Not Bo's best to date, but still a good one to have for his fans.#2 - 8#3 - 8 (f/ Spade, Bobby Sealz)#4 - 9 (f/ Killa Tay - good beat)#5 - 7.5 (f/ Phats Bossilini, Max Julian, Speedy, Hoodsta Rob, Cool Nutz)#6 - 8 (f/ Yukmouth)#7 - 6.5 (f/ Killa Tay, Roger Troutman Jr.)#8 - 7#10 - 9(good beat)#12 - 7.5 (f/ Cosmo, Bobby Sealz)#13 - 6 (f/ Cyco)#14 - 6.5 (f/ Fat tone, Brotha Lynch Hung)#15 - 7 (f/ Mr. Short Khop, CJ MAc)#16 - 8 (f/ Cyco, Pizzo, Marvaless, Thug Misses - good beat)#17 - 6.5 (f/ Bosko, E-40, Killa Tay, Thug Misses)#19 - 8#20 - 7 (f/ Young Meek - has a rock beat)b. Sean Thomas -- around 1973 -- Sacramento, CAcheck all my reviews"
4,Up north Crip-Hop at its best,"C-BO's second installation of his West Coast Mafia imprint is the best so far. Dont get me wrong, ""West Coast Ridas"" packed enough firepower to bring down a whole hood. ""West Coast Mafia"" starts off with three mediocre tracks but make up for it on track four featuring Killa Tay ( fellow West Coast Mafia Labelmate) on ""So Much Chedda"". This beat is laced with a carribean feel but keeps it gangsta. The next stand out track could be a single ona majour label. ""Party Tonite"" is a gangsta party classic. Yukmouts unigue vocals compliment C-BO's rugged gangsta style to a t. All in all there isnt very many stand out tracks on this album, but they are very good tracks that compliment eachother to make a four outta five star album. If ur a Westcoast fan youll love this album, if ur from the east coast come dip on our side and see wut thug life is really about."
5,cannot ask for anything better,"I cant believe i have not heard about this cd untill recently. all the beats are solid and all the rappers are quality. when you have a cd with 20 songs on it you would expect more crappy songs than a cd with less songs, but all the songs are decent and most of them are really good. nobody should give this cd less than a 4"
3,Good product for the price.,"I love the this product it make you feel the quality when you hold it in your hand, for the sound quality is good but for the distance it is only one KM."
5,"Easy to read, accurate and removable","Easy to read, cheap and accurate. This one is removable without braking, which the older similar ATI thermometer wasn't. So all in all I can only recommend it."
5,works,"Seems to work fine. I haven't tried to take it off and re-install it like it says it can, so i can't comment on that part but it lets me have piece of mind that my tank is warm enough for my beta without spending a fortune on other ones and also i love that i goes on the outside of the tank so it doesn't take away from tank space from my fish"
4,Accurate and easy to apply,"The product was easy to use. Just peel the back paper off and stick it to the aquarium, usually at the bottom corner. The temperature started showing almost immediately. Recommend this for pet fish owners so they can check if the water is at the temperature for their fishes."
3,faulty unit (1 out of 3),"This would be a 5-star review, except that one of the three I purchased was bad. The paper backing had somehow bonded to the thermometer, so when I tried to peel the paper, it ripped the back off. Seems like a manufacturing defect. These things happen. The other two work great, so I guess I have to keep buying them. Judging from the reviews here, this seems to be an uncommon experience.Bought these months ago just to have on hand, so way too late to return. Just my luck!I have one on a larger tank, and based on the temps showing on the other thermometers, it seems fairly accurate, probably w/in 1 degree of the true temp.EricPS since I'm writing this review, a suggestion: would it be too much trouble to update the picture to reflect what is actually being sold (ie horizontal instead of vertical)?"
4,Not what is pictured,"When my thermometer arrived it was as it says horizontal. the picture shows a vertical thermometer. Its a nice little thermometer and does well. I installed it on a round tank and the horizontal looks better then a vertical would. I installed it close to the bottom of the tank and it blends right in with everything, you have to really look to even know its there, sitting right above the gravel."
4,Does the job,"I just needed a small thermometer for my tank that would give me a rough temperature of the water. This certainly does this job. It immediately read the temperature once I stuck it onto the glass and is small enough that it is not very noticeable. If you are looking for more detailed temperatures, you may want to get a more expensive thermometer. This one gives you the temperature +/- a degree. That's fine for my setup, but may not be accurate enough for a more temperamental tank."
5,Works great,Used it on a 40 gallon tank to keep the fish a good temperature. Just as accurate as in-tank thermometer but I didn't have to clean it or manage it at all.
5,It's a thermometer,So far so good. I picked this one because I was trying to keep from piling too many items inside the tank. Seems to work fine.
5,"Simple, Easy, Accurate",Doesn't get any simpler than this. I put one at each end of my 36 gallon tank to measure temperature uniformity and they move up and down together. Great little device.
3,Not Great for Homebrew,"I should've noticed ahead of the order that the minimum temperature this unit can report is 68 degrees. That's not low enough for my needs. I had difficulty getting on of them to stick on a carboy. They are not really designed for what I'm trying to use them for, which is no fault of the manufacturer."
1,This book was very long with little to hold my interest.,"I understand that textbooks are not meant to be interesting but I use this book as one and I find it very very boring. It is drawn out and written in such a dry manner that I can not enjoy it at all. I am currently searching for a review book so I don't have to continue reading this book but I am having no luck, if you know of one please email me. Thank you"
1,Put me to sleep every time.,"I read this book as part of a high school AP class and I do not think that it was worth my time. The content was very boring and had too much detail that nobody really cares about. The author draws senseless things on for pages and pages that shouldn't even be in the book. I have looked for other sources to help me to even understand what this book is saying, and every other European history book that I have found is many times better than this."
3,A Solid History Textbook,"A History of Modern Europe is a comprehensive ouverview of European History. It takes the reader through history in a likeable pattern where it switches from country to country and maintains a chronological path. If one is looking for a history of an individual country, one needs to flip from one section to another. I enjoy history, and suprisingly enjoy history textbooks. This book is great factually, and leaves the reader with a sense of the little stories of history."
4,What??.... Then wow.,"I am in front of a computer all day at work. I don't have an office. I work all over the place. They tell me I can't wear headphones, but I can listen to music. What to do? I figured I would buy a small set of speakers. Well I got them! These speakers are really small! They are 1 and 1/2 the width of my Shuffle. Well, I figured why not try them. I have to say I am surprised how much sound comes out of them. Audiophile, not even close. Think portable radio (do they still make those?). Not the best sounding music, but it's better than no music. You can connect your shuffle and put the whole thing into a shirt pocket with lots of room left over. I would recommend these to people who need very portable speakers."
4,This watch is well worth purchasing for the price!,"This watch is inexpensive but has an amazing amount of features! My husband blows through watches, expensive or cheap, because of the job he has. This watch has held up and looks good. The only draw back is the wrist band is made out of plastic and my husband says it gets sweaty under the band. But even with that he likes it and is impressed that it was only $20!"
1,Does Not Work,I recieved the watch not functioning either because it is defective or that it does not contain a battery. You must return the watch to Malaysia only and not a local service center. You will pay shipping charges and a 10% restocking fee. The watch and customer service was not the quality that I expected.
1,Casio Watch Review,Casio watch was advertised as waterproof down to 100 meters. It failed on the first submersion as significant moisture collected inside the watch.
2,Great priced product,The product is exactly as described. Except the back light. It could use a better light for night viewing.
3,Setting the time and date is little difficult,I bought this recently. Looks good and not too big and too small. But setting the time and date and using other functions is not the much easy. May be you need to refer the manual each time you want to use other functions.
3,Good value but hour and minute hands hard to read,"Casio Men's World Time Databank 10-Year Battery Watch #AW80-7AVThis watch is a good value given all the functions it performs. My only criticism is that the hands and the dial are close in color. This lack of contrast makes it difficult for me to read in low light or at a quick glance. For people whose eyesight is not good, a watch with more distinctive hands will be a better choice. Otherwise, it's a fine instrument."
3,Watch good but dial color silver,The photo of this watch on Amazon is a bit misleading; it seems to be white but is not! Its silver background a little difficult to see the hands some times. All other features of the watch work for me....
4,Damfine,"This baby works as advertised and the setup instructions are easily followed (our Chinese suppliers are getting a handle on English) Great value, if the battery fails before 2023, I'll be right back to let you know about it."
1,1.5 Year Battery Life...,The battery life was not as advertised. The battery died after a year and a half of owning it which is half a year after the 1 year warranty coverage. Maybe Amazon had it in stock for 8.5 years already? It seems like it would be a risk to buy one of these watches at this point from Amazon and risk having to spend more money to replace the battery because it might cost just as much as it would to buy another one of these watches. Who knows how long they have their products in storage at their warehouses.I also own theCasio Men's AW80V-1BV World Time Ana-Digi Data Bank 10-Year-Battery Watchthat I bought at a Walmart back in 2008 that also has a 10 year battery life and the battery is still alive.
4,Great watch for $20,"The bottom line is that this is a great watch for the price. It does everything you want it to (and more) and is dirt-cheap. Like everyone else says, the illumination is sub-par. The LEDs will light the analog hands fine, but don't even attempt to make the digital area visible. The band feels really cheap, but I figure after a couple of months I'll replace it with a different one.There are so few watches that have the classic look of an analog while offering the added functionality of a digital at any price, let alone in the $20 price range.Overall, don't think that this watch will ever be mistaken for a $200 beauty. It does it's job and looks fine (from a distance) while doing so. I'm not at all disappointed."
4,If you can fiddle with it...,"The watch looks great, runs fine, etc. The issue, to me, is setting it. Unless you have an iron clad memory, do not lose the instruction book. This is not your father's watch. I have resigned myself to using the analog display of time and the digital display of day and date...period. This works great, and is really all I need. The other stuff s just more than I want to deal with. There are 4 buttons around the watch, and they all do something or don't do anything depending on the mode you are in (which is also based on which button you push and the number of times), and the number of times you press them. There is no logic that I see to them. So, it is an adventure. But, with the book, you can get it done. It lays out the logic of the engineer who figured this out, so it may be that I just don't want to learn. Aside from that, no complaints. I just hope I don't lose my instruction book when the time changes."
3,A basic timepiece at a great price,"I have had this watch for @ 2 months now. I say for under 20 dollars it's a pretty good watch. It has kept perfect time over 2 months. It is lightweight and the band is very comfortable. I like having the analog hands and being able to display the digital date/time.Now in no way do I expect this watch to be anywhere near the quality of my Citizens Chronograph, my Invicta Diver or my Swiss Army Officers watch. The Casio is a watch I bought for bumming around.On the negative side, the light does not do a very good job of illumination. Additionally, setting the time is really cumbersome. Setting the anaog time is not too bad, but setting the digital date and time is really a pain. Keep the instructions handy, you will need it when you have to change the time.All in all, for @ 15 dollars, it is a nice decent watch. A good value purchase"
3,A Wonderful Inexpensive Watch !!,"I wear this watch several times a week. It's lightweight... so I don't even notice it on my wrist. I like it's appearance.But... take notice of a few things.The backlight does not really do much good. And, the crystal is easily scratched.At less than $20... it's a good buy."
2,Didn't last 2 years!,"The 10yr battery life and the waterproof rating made the $20 price a great deal. But, I have had this watch for under 2 years and the seal broke and water got inside.When I checked how the seal was broken I found a large crack in the plastic body of the watch. The crack runs through one of the screw holes (for the back plate) and is perpendicular to the band pin. Either a design or manufacturing flaw has the force of the band pins being too great for the plastic body to bear. The result is a crack along the weakest point (screw hole) that compromised the waterproof seal.Luckily I caught this before too much damage was done by the water that got in. Now I am left with a watch back with three screws in it, no waterproofing.The lesson; even if it's a great deal, a cheap watch is just a cheap watch. I wouldn't recommend it, I've have better life from $6 watches."
4,"Good watch, great buy!","The face is easy to read - day, date, and time. Lots of good features - alarms, etc. The band is comfortable, too. I've been looking for some time for an inexpensive, good quality, manly watch. This seems to be all of of the above. It is tough, too. I've been gardening and got it wet several times. The night light is weak but passable. Try it out if you are looking for the same type of watch."
2,So-so face,"this was supposed to have a white face, but is is silver-faced. Reading the face is very difficult. Particularly at night even with the backlight!"
1,you get what you pay for,"Cheap, cheap, cheap...not worth the money. It's a watch but it is a cheap watch. Looks cheap, feels cheap...save your money."
3,"Okay watch, but not great","I liked the look of the watch and thought the digital part would be useful, but the inadequate light, the complicated steps necessary to set the watch, and the lack of contrast between the hands and the face (which scratched easily) created problems for me. I'm almost 60, and the watch (both analog and digital parts) was difficult to read without glasses. I once spent almost three hours on an airplane studying the tiny instruction manual to learn how each feature worked, but it was so complex that I never did master or remember all of the steps. My problems were solved when I inadvertently dropped the watch from a height of about five feet onto a concrete floor, and it died completely. I had it just over two years. I'm getting a simple digital watch from Casio now."
2,Poor Backlight,Watch has very poor display in the night - Used watch for 2 years - the battery works but the watch stopped working.
2,Watch has several faults,"Analog and digital time have to be set independently and both run independently.No winding stem, so resetting the analog when you travel is a pain.The light is useless-- it's a white light and you cannot read the hands in the dark.The crystal scratches easily.There are positives:The watch looks good.The digital display is large enough to read without glasses."
3,bionicle heroes felt average,"I am reporting what my 11 year old said about this game - he said that he was excited to get the game because he is a big fan of bionicles in general. However, the gameplay felt repetitive and didn't have as much depth as he would have liked. He did tell me how cool it was that the game allowed you to battle/play with older bionicles as well."
5,Great Deal!,"I bought this for $13(full price is $40). I was looking for one used, and this one is in perfect condition. I saw ones that were used(and in poor condition)that were way over full price for a new one. The service was great, and I got it on time. This was a great buy, and I encourage you to buy from this seller!"
3,Just O.K.,"We bought this for our Bionicle-obsessed 8 and 9 year-old boys - just the audience I'm assuming the creators intended to appeal to. Out of the 4 games they received for Christmas, this fell to the bottom of the heap and became the one least played. It seemed difficult and frustrating to use. The boys did like the action, but their frustration led them to abandon the game pretty quickly."
1,Not the best Mtn bike guidebook,"Purchased this book for a mountain bike trip to Idaho. I was excited to read about the trail titled South Hills Singletrack Nirvana. While the author kept meticulous detail of the number of creek crossings, he failed to mention that the trail is mostly loose gravel climbing which was impossible to ride. It was not my idea of Nirvana. It was a big disappointment, especially since I drove over two hours to get there. There are better Idaho mtn bike guidebooks out there. A book titled ""Good Dirt"" is a great guide for riding in the Ketchum/Sun Vally area."
4,pretty good MTB guide for Idaho,"This is NOT A HIKING GUIDE. This is a MTB guide to Idaho, afact which eluded the previous two reviewers. THERE ARE time anddifficulty ratings for each trail. It is well done and worthyour time if you are into MTB and would be in Idaho. It alsohas altitude changes for the rides. Very helpful. Enjoy."
2,"background, background, background","i bought this cd hoping that it would contain some actual interviews, but its probably only about 2% interview, 90% background info (from the sp career up until just before the cd was released in 2000), and then the last 8% is this weird corny techno/british elevator music going at the end of each track. this cd would be good if you were doing a report on the sp for school or something, not for somone looking for really good, original info and interviews by the pumkins. the best thing is the mini poster inside of billy and james that says ""MAXIMUM PUMPKINS"", but thats about it."
5,Finally!!!!,I searched for almost a year to find this album... it was well worth the wait! Tenor Saw has a remarkable sense of style that doesn't sound manufactured as many artists these days do. I hope to hear more from him soon!!!!
1,Worthless! Protects screen by BLOCKING stylus!,"I bought this at a local store very excited to protect my new DS Lite. After getting the bottom protector on, my stylus no longer worked! Now that I've read the other reviews I know it wasn't my husband's application or that my set was labeled wrong, it is just how the product is. I'm guessing it protects the screen from scratches by not letting you use the stylus!! I'm going to return this worthless thing and get something else!"
1,Worst Pelican Product Ever,"I purchased this product for my son's ds that I gave him for Christmas. Put this on the ds even though no instructions were included. Looked fine at first but then my son asked what there was something that looked like a rainbow sheen on the dark screens. I looking at other comments on amazon and found out that alot of people have had problems with this product. Just noticed that one person read one of the comments and said ""Thanks for saving me the $10 bucks"" wish I had checked here first and could have saved the $10 too. I called and the e-mail Pelican Support and all that they were willing to do is replace the product with another. So the I would have to spend postage and end up with another faulty product. With all the postings I am not the only one having problems with this product. Save yourself the money and the hassel of trying to remove all the adhesive that is left on your screen when you remove the product."
1,Not Good,I too found the protectors difficult to apply correctly...then when I got them on the stylus wouldnt work on the game...also the stylus' that came with this pack did not fit in my nintendo ds' holder - whats the point.
3,It's Really not that bad,Don't listen to the other reviews about how this product is bad (they all exagerate). Just throw away the top screen protector. That's whats bad. It leaves behind adhesive after applying and has a rainbow sheen that's all. So save yourself the trouble throw away the top screenguard (what's a top screen guard for anyways?).
5,A Cross Cultural celebration for your soul!,"This is a wonderful CD....full of celebratory music from around the globe. Amazing tracks, that push this album over the top are: Ogum Beira-Mar (from Norther Brazil), Dane of Kwenyii (from the Wapa Tribe), Allah Alik Allah, and Celiesi braliti (Latvian). Produced by a great record label that contributes a portion of each sale to the Rainforst Alliance! Highly recommended."
2,"I thought this was a book about Kessa, NOT her therapist...","I decided to give this book 2 stars instead of 1 because although the book is extremely stereotypical, it was readable and I didn't toss it aside like I would have if it was *really* awful. This book is definately not one that I'd read a second time though.The first half of the book is written more from Kessa's point of view...so the first half is ok. But then when she enters treatment, it seems to shift focus off of Kessa and the spotlight shines on her BRILLIANT, UNDERSTANDING, and WONDERFUL therapist. It gets very annoying after awhile. If I wanted to read a book about a therapist treating an anorectic I would find one... but I thought this book would be from the anorectics point of view. Anyway, needless to say, this book was somewhat of a disapointment... It's not really worth the read."
1,Don't Bother,I'm 15 and dealing with anorexia and bulimia since I was 11. I began reading the book hoping it would help me understand and relate to someone else. From the moment I began reading I could tell that who wrote the book had never experienced the disorder personally. I don't think it really showed how this disorder is. First she was a 15 year old weighing 96 pounds before she even began starving herself and you don't just all of the sudden decide to do this to yourself. I felt it portrayed an unrealistic look at the life of one with an eating disorder. It was your typical eating disorder story and completely predictable. I don't recommend wasting your time on this book. Read Wasted it's worth it.
2,Over simplified...,"I absolutly detested this book. I felt as though the author was talking down to me the entire time I was reading it. I am 24 years old and have been ana/mia on and off since I was eight (in ballet and striving to be the best little girl in the world myself).I feel that the author took too much liberty with the subject, and that treating ana/mia patients and being involved in their lives can only give an outsider so much insight, he was never (and will never be) a female struggling with an eating disorder and didn't convince me that he understood one iota of the disease's complexity.More than the story, it was the writing that irritated me. Having a doctorate does not an effective author make."
1,The Best Little Trigger Book in the World,"This is the best little trigger book in the world. This book should not be read until you are very secure in your self image. If you are the average person that would pick up and read this book, then this most likely will trigger an eating disorder in you.Its full of catchy rhymes, 'tricks', and making eating disorders glamarous. Yes, it was written in the 70's? (not sure) But even then, it seems a glamorous image...shes comparing herself to magazine pictures..which are bad also, because many of the models are entirely too thin.Don't let your kids read this. Its not worth the trauma it could cause, and I am not speaking with sarcasm here. This book is not good for anyones mental health."
1,Read this if you want more lies....,"Levenkron wrote ""The Best Little Girl in the World"" in the 1970's. Sence that time there have been many more discoveries. It is now known that anorexia is not related to control or attention. In this novel that is all that is discussed. The poor girl's sick behavior is focused on, the disease is all that is discussed. What about recovery? I am 19 and been in 3 treatment centers for eatting disorders. If you want to focus on crazy behavior and pre historic theory's about eatting disorders, go ahead and read this. If not read something else, anything else. I can gaurantee it will be better from the sole then this book of lies."
1,Disappointing,"My first disappointment upon receiving this book is to learn that it is fictional. Clearly, that was my fault for not reading more carefullly before I ordered, but I still wanted to mention that, lest anyone make the same mistake I did.But far more disappointing than that was the actual book. I have never read anything so forced, contrived, and cliche. The writing is absolutely dreadful, the characters are stock-characters and utterly predictable. The alcoholic, gruff father. The peace-keeping, clueless mother. A rebellious daughter. Blah blah blah. I forced myself to read half of this book before I gave up.I don't agree with the reviewers who say this book is going to ""teach"" someone to be anorexic. Odds are, anyone who's reading this book for tips probably knows what thy're doing anyway.This book, however, is absolutely dreadful in terms of writing, character development, and plot. Please, please, please, save your money. This book is so not worth it."
3,stereotypical,"The book was well written, as there was much insight provided to anorexia nervosa, however there was much sterotyping. Even though research supports that dancers and athletes are among the highest population plagued with eating disorders, I felt as though the book (like society) does not realize that eating disorders expound far beyond just young high class white ballet dancers. There are aspects I could relate to as a sufferer myself, but I felt out of the loop because I am not your typical anorexic or bulimic. While I know that one book cannot encompass every person and their struggles, I feel as though too much was left out of this. While Levenkron specializes in eating disorders, I still feel there is a different language spoken when it come from the victim themself. It is an easy read, and insightful for those who have no knowledge of eating disorders, but dissappointing for those who suffer with the pain."
1,Simply not intresting,The book was quite dull and lacked any real depth. Kessa's decent into her nightmare of an eating disorder reads off as a stereotypical checklist of what an anorexic girl should be like. The character did not breathe and come to life from the pages. It was though the author searched for the word anorexic and threw every symptom into Kessa.
2,not that big a deal,This book was alright. Not that big a deal. I was expecting a little more. A bit disappointing but informative.
3,Thinner is definitely not the winner.,"Have you ever heard the saying, ""Thinner is the winner""? I would bet that most people haven't. That's because it's the personal saying of a young dancer named Francesca Dietrich. Francesca has always been quiet, mild mannered, and academically Successful. But, when pressure starts building up to lose weight at dance, and the deafening silence of being ignored at home becomes overwhelming, a new person emerges. Her name is Kessa. She's the new and improved version of Francesca, she's an anorexic. She starts slipping down dramatically, in weight and grades, and also into an obsessive eray of rituals centered around weight loss. If you like books about psychological disorders, and books that you can learn a great deal form, then this book is for you. But, those with a weak stomach beware; the sad truth about this disease is quite sickening."
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star,"When I was teenage anorexic, this book helped me to stay that way. It confirmed all my fears and gave me some new ones. It also gave me tips as to make myself more ill - which I accept was part of my illness, but nonetheless, people should be wary of reading this if they want to be healthy.That was over a decade ago now. Now when I read this book all is see is a grandiose psychologist attempting to ""prove"" his insight and skill, that are in my opinion, questionable... or absent. Sorry if he means well, but Levenkron just does not get inside the mind of someone with Anorexia - he does not get the fear, the loathing, the control, the lack of options, the desires to get well and stay ill. No, Levenkron does not get it.This is not a helpful book if you are ill or if you want to understand Anorexia Nervosa. Choose something else."
4,Love/Hate,"I became completly absorbed and obseesed with this book. Stuggling with annorexia myself, Kessa provided companionship for me, as I isolated myself from the rest of the world. It however, I don't think was a healthy influence. The Best Little Girl in the World became me Bible, from which I molded much of my behavior. While it was by no means a cause of my struggle, I found myself adopting many of Kessa's behavior. Read this book with caution. If you are struggling with an eating disorder yourself, I urge you to restrain the temptation of reading it."
5,Stirring and triggering,"I love this book, and was deeply affected by it after reading it at age 14. However, the book is a quite romanticized account of anorexia. What insecure teenage girl would not want to be the fragile, thin, beautiful, troubled Kessa? I would say that for most teens, this book would simply be an engrossing ""issue of the month"" book. However, for those on the edge of anorexia, this book can make the condition seem seductive and appealing. Basically, I would recommend this book for someone who is interested in learning the ""why"" behind eating disorders, but I would never suggest giving it to an anorexic or bulimic child. An unstable girl will use the book as a bible, and it will likely increase her desire to lose weight."
4,Solidly Good,"It's a good book. I read all of it. I never lost interest. An easy read for sure, if you enjoy reading about these sorts of things which I do."
1,Stereotyped Crap,"This book was a real disappointment. It perpetuates the simplistic stereotype of anorexics as affluent, high-achieving white girls who lean towards perfectionism to deal with controlling parents and other family stress. (The protagonist in this book even does ballet.) The prototype Levenkron generates is overtypified and uninteresting. To make matters worse, the book is poorly written. Although it benefits from an inherently interesting topic, I can only hope that Levenkron is a better psychiatrist than novelist. The book may be shocking to those unfamiliar with anorexia, but for those who are, it's pretty mundane."
2,Levenkron's attempt to make himself seem great,"Kessa is a representation of a girl with anorexia nervosa. When reading this book, one may think that this represents the majority of eating disordered patients. In fact, it is mostly an ""ego-boost"" for the psychologist, who seems, on the surface, to know what he's talking about but really doesn't have a clue. Not a helpful read, mostly depressing and false."
2,A book for Levenkron's ego alone,"I'm sorry, but I have read a ton of material concerning eating disorders and have had enough close personal experience with them to see that this book is terrible. It is no more than a chronicle of how brilliant Levenkron thinks he is in understanding the mind of an anorexic. I'm glad for his prose that so blantantly displays that he's impressed with his ability to cure the disorder rather than concerned with the actual ramifications of the disorder itself - bravo. A must-not-read, indeed."
2,Not the Best,"An eye opening look into the pysce of people suffering from anorexia nervosa. 15 year old Francesca appears to lead a fairly normal life. She is a pretty, all A student, who also happens to be a wonderfull dancer. One day at class her teacher and role model points out that she could stand to lose a few pounds, and "" Kessa"" is born. Kessa is stronger than Francesca ever was, Kessa doesn't need to eat, doesn't need to fill her body with such impurities as food. Kessa is thin thin thin, but never thin enough. Although heart wrenching, The Best Litttle Girl in the World shows a realistic look at the journey back to normality, and self acceptance."
2,"Good points, but too much language","I'd love to share the book with my 12 year old who is suffering with anerexia, but the language was inappropriate. I agree with many other reviews, but nobody seemed bothered by the PG13 language. It's not how we talk in my family and I don't need to plant those ideas in my struggling girl!!!"
5,excellence,A super book that really got the readerr inside the mind of the character Kessa. This made you feel sorry for her and sympathize over her postion in her family. The book also talked and explained many different aspects of anerexia. This book keeps you attentive and I regret having finishing it. It makes you wonder what happens to Kessa or Francesca.
5,Wonderful!!!,"Wow. I loved this book so much! I can't believe that she would think that she was fat!!! I really liked this book even though it was made like twenty years ago it still seems like it's a new book. I would give this book a million stars because I could relate to it so much!!!! I really want to see the movie that stars Jennifer Jason Leigh and Helen Hunt but I can't find it anywhere!!! I hope that the sequal to this book ""Kessa"" is as good as this one was. I love this book!!!"
1,"Intense pain and only 1,000 words to describe it","Reading this made me wish that the information we gain from books was more tangible, like food. If it were I would have rushed immeadiatly to the bathroom to vomit up all of the information it put in my head. That is space in my brain that is going to be occupied by the information in that, that, book (if you want to grace it with that title) that I can never get back.If this is where literature is going, then count me out. Don't get me wrong, reading is my main hobby, but this was painful to read. It was written at a level for people who have trouble with the back of the cereal box.On the upside, I can imagine no more successful torture methods for political prisoners than providing them with that *thing* as their only source of entertainment. However, they could lose a lot of prisoners that way, because while you're reading it suicide looks awfully friendly."
2,"14, CA","I thought ""The Best Little Girl in the World"" was a book created more for an anorexic audience than just the general. I original got the book because I was ""practicing"" anorexia and thought it might have some tips/ inspiration. All around it is very stereotype and not a book I would usually recommend, not even to anorexics. Honestly I didn't like the book."
2,Entertaining but Dangerous,"While this book is entertaining and even ""informative"", it is dangerous. Over the years I know that much blame has been put on this book and even on the author, however, I think that it is the ""informative"" nature that makes it so dangerous. I remember reading it for the first time (at age 11) and while I don't remember a clear ""wow, anorexia is cool"" thought going through my mind - it definitely opened a door. Being a (naturally thin) gymnast and model, I think the book gave me ideas I wouldn't have had yet. Do I blame the book? Not entirely. Would I let my daughter read it? Definitely not. Choosing to starve myself to be thin has had repercussions that will last the rest of my life - I will always regret reading that book and making that choice."
5,This was like reading about my life,"This book was a mirror image to how I felt. It made me cry and realize that I needed help, and I would get better. I recommended this book to a friend and she loved it. I couldn't put it down."
5,quick and easy,I ordered a book from Amazon which I was unable to get at the bookstore. It was inexpensive and arrived in perfect condition a few days later. I am always pleased by Amazon!
3,Interesing Account of a Girl's Desent into Anorexia,"As a recovering anorexic, I've developed a library of books on the subject of my disease. As a therapist, Levenkron gives some interesting insight about the anorexic mind that many other authors cannot share; though primarily told through the eyes of a girl modeled off Levenkron's clients, he also leaves room for the perspective of the girl's parents and the psychiatrist that eventually saves her. Though I don't necessarily recommend this book for an anorexic or bulimic, I wish that more people in general would read this kind of book; that way many of the myths about eating disorders would be dissolved."
5,GREAT BOOK,"OK, THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK ABOUT A GIRL FACED WITH ANOREXIA. I HOPE PEOPLE REALIZE FROM THIS THAT ANOREXIA ISNT A JOKE, IT IS A TRUE PROBLEM. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I MYSELF HAVE ONE. IT IS A TORTURE THAT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO FACE, AND I WANT EVERYONE READING THIS TO KNOW THIS AND REALIZE THIS. EMAIL ME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS"
2,ZZZZZZZZ......,"the author of this book seems to know what he is talking about, but this book is just sooo boring. its like reading a text book."
2,Please- don't make this book stand out,"I purchased this book withone hing in mind-Learn how to become an anorexic. Thanks to all you other Handbook to hell people, that's why I purchased it. If you're gonna do something like that do it discreetly. I think its a good book, but its not a handbook to anorexia and it shouldn't be used as one. Thanks to all you HTH people it is. well, all you people, you people who urge caution in reading this book are doing is saying: Hey! You know what this book is? Its a handbook to anorexia! Isn't that great? You can learn how to be an anorexic too! Isn't that great? I also want to say that Myrna was entirely nessescery- she made Kessa see how disgusting she was. also I have a theory on how Kessa could have been saved. madame coulda seen what was going on earlish and told KESSa to stop, I betcha she woulda stopped."
2,interesting fact,"i just learded that the author of this book was karen carpenter's psycotherapist. i love the carpenters, i want to read this book...."
2,Same as FIFA Fever,"All of the footage is the same. I was so excited to see they brought out another FIFA title, but everything is the same, not only that, you can get it on over stock dot com for $15, and FIFA Fever is only $12, which has much more footage."
3,Lot of info but few drills,The DVD has 3 major sections with Drills explained during the last one. It has a lot of info on technique and injuries but I was kind of disappointed regarding the drills section; I was expecting more from it. It might be expensive for the price if what you're looking for are drills to improve your running.
3,Staples don't easily fit into bostitch magazine/slide,"These staples are fine, but they don't easily fit into a bostich staple gun. These staples are too long of a clip to easily insert. You have to wiggle them in around some obstructions or break them into smaller amounts. A hassle either way. I use my gun myself, but if you have a crew using it, I can imagine this would lead to the gun breaking sooner, because they aren't going to break the staples apart and load them all the time or finesse the staples into the gun. Of course not everyone has a bostitch staple gun or even the same model I do (don't have it handy)... I'd imagine these staples would have the same issue in some other guns so the model isn't that critical of mine. Saving some money can always come with a price."
4,Eighties humour and rock working together in style,"This cd is one for all joe walsh fans new and old, its a bit more bubble gum than many of his cd's. If you have heard ordanary average guy than you'll like this slicker earlier recording that has all the humour and style of what we come to expect from joe over the years. This eighties edition from joe walsh ha sthe slick style of many eighties cds but joe keeps the music in touch with irony and true style."
2,Alcohol & sedatives starting to rot the brain?,"I have just about everything Joe Walsh has ever released.Did Joe Walsh really release this? The same guy who released ""Barnstorm"" or ""But Seriously Folks""? Yikes.It sounds as if Joe was scraping the bottom of the barrel or just didn't have a handle on things. It feels like they are just going through the motions as they roll up those dollar bills and slam some JD.Highlights? Hmmmm I guess I enjoy ""In my car"",& ""Memory Lane"".Now if I ever play the CD, I skip around quite a bit between songs.Bottom line: ""Got Any Gum"" is one of the least played CD's in my Joe Walsh collection.Additional two cents... ""Got Any Gum"" and ""Song's for a dying planet"" are the worst in Joe Walsh's cannon of music. Not very much depth and inspiration with a few exceptions/gems in each.If you can get it cheap, and need to complete your Joe Walsh collection, go for it. There are much worse forms of music/releases!"
4,you'll probably like it,"this album leaves a strange feeling of 'deja heard', it's just not original. of course, Blackmore IS a guitar player, but how about the rest? well, the rest is good, but not as good, as one could expect from Blackmore. the instrumentals and a couple of songs are worth five stars though."
2,"Not nearly ""Renaissance"" enough!","I did have high hopes for this disc, but alas, the notices I'd read of it supposedly being some kind of purist/full-on Medievalist work are far from the truth. Most of the disc sounds like typical MOR balladry with slight Olde Musick touches, and is not dissimilar to what any MOR band might do whilst in a ballad mood. Perhaps years of cranking out mediocre FM rock with Rainbow and the reformed Deep Purple has dulled Mr. Blackmore's sensibilities as to what constitutes moving early music - I have no doubt that if he had attempted something like this immediatley after leaving Deep Purple the first time 25 years ago, the end result would have been much better. As it is, for renaissance-tinged popular music, old Jethro Tull, Ms. McKinnett, or especially the unjustly ignored Gryphon, will stand you in much better stead."
3,Twee Twiddlings from Ritchie,"I've read the other reviews and I disagree. This album was a real disappointment to me as a lifelong Blackmore fan. The album starts well with some very distinctive tracks, but quickly becomes much of a muchness. Ritchie should have recorded fewer tracks and spend more time polishing and crafting the best. Definitely not in the same class as Loreena McKennit and other celtic/minstrel artists."
3,This is great background music....,"The musicianship of this is pretty good, but Ms. Night's voice, though pleasing, is not exceptional. If she does have the ability, she doesn't take too many chances. The lyrics aren't too weighty either. However, having said all that, I didn't feel cheated buying this CD, but I wouldn't go out of the way for anymore like this."
5,Increible voz de Vonzell!!! Y ni hablar de Carrie!,"Muy bueno! Realmente me sorprendio el caudal de voz de Baby V y no estas demas destacar a Carrie, que tiene una voz increible!Espero poder encontrar pronto el cd de Vonzell a la venta aqui.Saludos! Desde Argentina!"
4,It's nice!,"All 3 songs are nice, especially When You Tell Me That You Love Me and Everything is Beautiful. Everything is Beautiful is my favourite and the top 12 of season 4 did a fantastic job in all 3 songs. They got voices, and they are talented. They are awesome!"
2,"Average, would suggest to buy Season 4 Showstoppers instead","This CD was only average. I didn't really like 'He ain't heavy..."" and ""Everything is Beautiful"". Just not very strong vocals. I did really like ""When you tell me that you love me"" But that comes on Showstoppers which is a really good CD so I would just suggest that you buy that instead. Though I do like the idea that this CD benefits the red cross..."
4,Enjoyable...,"This is an enjoyable 3 song single to listen to in the car. ""He Ain't Heavy, He's my Brother"" is probably the best track. The standout voices are Constantine, Carrie, Bo and Vonzell. If you are a fan of any of those 4, purchase this single!"
5,hilarious,"I bought this book on a recomendation from a coworker, and my two boys LOVE IT. It's full of potty humor which is a great hit with them. I love reading this book to them before bed."
2,Doesn't Offer The Radio Edit,"This is a very good example of Euro pop, but the ""single"" offered here doesn't have the original radio edit, which is, to my mind, the most effective version of the song. You have to buy the complete CD to get the radio edit, which doesn't really seem fair play. The extended mix version (cut one) is fine, but it doesn't really compare to the power and energy of the original radio edit, which is usually included on maxi singles of this type. And so, I'd have to call this disappointing. The other mixes aren't particulartly inventive, and as for the acoustic version; well, you can see why DJ Encore's input was necessary. All in all, a let down."
2,Not RIng Shank Nails,"Tried to order ring shanked nails for siding. First box arrived had spiral nails but was marked ring shank. Amazon was quick enough to get a new box, but alas it was not to be. Another box marked ring shank when opened was just as the first, another 1,000 more spiral nails. Bummer."
4,A must!,"I saw Sean Costello play at the Bayfront Blues festival in Duluth MN this past August. He played a gig the night before his festival set at a bar right next to my hotel - we stopped in for a bite to eat, and stayed for the show. Good plan. Sean OWNED the bar for the four hours we saw him. He's an amazing player, roaming all over the map, from rockabilly to blues to swing, and he's got the band to back it all up. If you want to check out a fine young talent, this is the disc to get. And catch him live if you can."
4,"If you already know who Sean is, what are you waiting for?","Wow, what a great CD. I loved Call the Cops and most of Cuttin In, but this is his most cohesive album yet. The guitar style on this disc is vastly diferent from ""Cops"", which was more in the Jr. Watson vein. His approach is much more traditional and I hear alot more of an Otis Rush inlfuence (in his singing and playing) than before. Sean still throws in some jazzier runs, but this much more rooted in Chicago style blues. There are the few ""soul style"" cuts, but the blues purist wont be put off by them at all. However, if you already know who Sean is, what in the world are you waiting for? Buy the darn thing."
5,A Christmas Card--Forrester Sisters,"I had a record of this, and loved it. Now I don't have a record player, so when I saw that it had been reissued as a CD, I jumped at it. The Forrester Sister was one of my favorite groups, and I love Christmas music. It's a beautiful cd. And it has just the right amount of varity, and it's very tasteful. I would recommend this cd."
5,great book for refrence,this is a great book for music fanatics and people who love to find out the nitty gritty details of their favorite rock stars careers and birthdays and such. Great for figuring out where musicians get their starts. I higly recomend this book to anyone who even is remotely interested in pursuing music as a career.
4,Almost excelent!,"As an old rock and roll fan I found this encyclopeadia very good. It is written very lucidly, in popular manner, with love. The selection is always in such kind of publication arguable, but I found this selection very good. Although... I found some big omission. For example: there are not Prodigy. Some omissions like this are the reason for giving ""only"" four stars. Anyway, I think this is the best rock and roll encyclopaedia in last decade."
5,Most informative Rock & Roll Book I've seen!!!,"This book features an article about almost every band that I or any of my friends could think of. It is one of the most interesting and informative books that I've read in a long time. If you don't know much about popular bands, this book is a must."
1,Giant disappointment,"Bought this unit with great expectations, but..1. Bought expensive Memorex DVD-R's. First insertion recorder refused to recognize the disk.2. Bought more expensive Fujifilm DVD-R's. Discs recognized by player but.. after <1min recording time the recorder shuts down and says recording failed, DVD might be dirty. Created three expensive coasters.3. Tried another Memorex. It worked but picture stutters badly.4. Supplied DVD-RAM. Works, but again picture stutters.Unit was returned within 5 days."
5,EXCELLENT RECORDER,"I have been a Toshiba buyer for years. So when it was time to buy a DVD recorder I chose the DR-1. I CHOSE RIGHT!!!!! This machine is great,like all Toshiba products!! I've had it about 3 months and have run at least 100 dvd-r and dvd-rw's through it without a single problem. In fact some of the recordings look better on the dvd then the tape I recorded from!! If you're looking for a great dvd recorder then take a look at the DR-1."
2,Nothing personal,"Nothing personal is set in Northern Ireland during the 1970's, when the Troubles were at their height. The story centers on one memorable night when two former friends, one a UVF member and the other a humble catholic fatehr raising two children. The meaning of the title is most likely a comment on the war that has been going on for years, that the war is no longer about personal hated toward a specific person for anaction they had done, but for just what they represent. The movie isn't that centered but the ending does give off the message very clearly: Violence is wrong. Duh! We know that but the message comes heartbreakingly and most unfairly, but then again all violence is unfair."
1,"No pain, no gain.","These sandals will not stay on my feet - they slide out sideways from under the heels within the first five steps. I had to use athletic tape to secure them to my feet.Once secured I was able to try them out. I must say they work...my feet did feel MUCH better once I removed these torture devices. Be sure to wear socks, as these will tear up your feet in no time. I guess if your credo is ""No pain, no gain"" and you like Vibram FiveFinger shoes or fire-walking these might be for you...otherwise, avoid!"
5,Groupthink as it applies to ALL policy decisions,"This text covers the Bay of Pigs invasion as well as several other whitehouse decisions by cabinet and select committee members with all the right information, yet make the wrong decisions. The answer is based upon the dynamics of the group and the power it has in swaying opinions, even if the group member knows that it is wrong. As group members, each if in fear of group rejection or not going along with the flow. It demonstrates why some group member should always be devil's advocate if proper decisions are to be subjective. A super read for those interested in international politics and the U.S. Governments' ability to see or not see the obvious."
2,Guitar instruction,This was OK but Steve was not very revealing about his technique and how he is able to be so precise for so long as he plays.
5,Best hairball remedy ever,"Last year one of my cats stareted developing hairballs at an alarming rate. He would throw up several times a week. Each incident would include 2-3 times of vomiting before the hairball would come up. I tried all the differents pastes and several differnet foods. One night my cat became violently ill. Well 1000.00 dollars and a barium study later, it was discovered that a huge hairball lodged itself in my cat's intestines. I knew I had to do something. After some research I discovered this food. While very pricey, I figured it was worth a shot at this point. Well the hairball problem is solved. Maybe one incident every two weeks now. My other cat never gets a hairball anymore. I am very impressed and will never change from this food."
5,"If you don't already have this, you're missing out!","This CD will change the way you look at music forever. Buy it. Buy two, just incase. It's pure genius and it will make you feel like you're 10 again. I can't emphysize enough how good this is. So just buy it."
5,SKA AT IT'S WACKIEST,"The Aquabats: A Ska rollercoater collision of The B-52's, Devo and DC Comics all rolled into one. Addictively fun! A party-band supreme, you must see them live. ""CD-Repo Man"" is the answer to everyone who ever took my CD's and never gave them back."
5,BUY IT NOW!,This is the best cd I own! They don't have one bad song on this album. They're rockn' music will keep you skankin forever. I especially enjoyed cd repo man. The Aquabats RULE!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Received SIX yarns Don't expect twelve like pic shows,It is obvious that these are decent quality yarns. But my package was marked as group A and that is all I received. Not A and B . Not sure if it is a mistake or not ? but it does say in description six yarns. I ordered this quickly without reading so If you are too don't expect twelve like in the pic :)Other than that my daughter likes the colors and shipping was fast.
2,An uncomfortable re-issue.,"My copy is a re-issue of the 1950s original. It must have been reduced in size, because the type is much too small for comfort, and heavily leaded, which makes it worse. Definitely not a book for reading in dim light. Then, can you imagine a book about railroads without a single map? Were they lost in the re-issue, or were they also missing in the original? It's a good book, but heavy reading, and I miss the maps.The Northern Railroads in the Civil War, 1861-1865"
2,The Northern Railroads in the Civil War,"A tremendous amount of research was done by the author, but the first half of the book is an accountant's dream - all figures. The better ""meat"" is in the second half of the book."
5,tragic search for the infinite,"simultaneously one of the saddest and most hopeful books i have ever read, this is an account of gerard de nerval's descent into insanity and his frantic search for something beyond what the positivists offer, a ""spirit world"". nerval obsesses over an actress who barely knew he existed, idealizing her to a seriously nutty point--but during all this he visits funerals, graveyards other places, apparently believing he is in touch with something metaphysical. i read this book awhile ago but i do remember his reference to his rejection by the woman, aurelia:""one's only option after these kinds of events is whether to die or go on living."" touching, mystical, and sad."
5,Best explanation of a Romantic,"Because this book shows what a real romantic means beyond the common meaning of ""being in love"". Because De Narval is a Romantic, he behaves trying to be the center of everything, no matter the price or the pride. He loves as a tool to make women move around him. His dreams are an extension of his life, so he can live any dream as real because the memorie of the real is the same as the memorie of the dream."
5,"Heavy but worth the trip, of course","Esp. knowing the back-story, reading these writings can be a downer... but, very psychedelic and stimulating along with the depression. If you are interested in Romantic-French-Proto-Surrealist writing (I know I am, and I don't know why you wouldn't be), then have at it. Can be dry in places, but should be read carefully nonetheless (probably)."
4,The Camera Never Lies - Michael Franks,"First, I very much like working with Amazon.com. You have what I want at a very fair price. Also, you give me quick service.I am a Michael Franks fan. There aren't that many of us. I have all his LP records and now all of his CD's. This particular CD has been out of print for a while. Amazon.com knew my purchase history and let me know when it was available.Yes, I very much recommend your company.Harold AndersonLone Tree, CO"
2,Not Her Best,Im not sure what the producers of this album were doing but it just didnt work for me. They didnt seem to be using her vocals to their full potential. They seemed to be making a more dance pop oriented album and that is not what Grant should be singing. The songs had some powerful lyrics but again seemed like dance songs or something. I would definetly check out her other CDs but this is not one of her best.
5,A great memory card!,I like this memory card because it has 469 pages of memory. You do not have to buy more memory cards.
3,typical,"Not much interesting about this recording. They can't even get the lyrics to the ""Sesame Street Theme"" right! Picture Sam Kinison singing with Perry Como."
4,Very helpful video!,"I really enjoy this video more everytime I watch it. It is packed with helpful tips on traveling in Europe, European history, some art history, and humor. The quality of the photography is very good. This will get you excited about traveling! Rick Steves is more ""in the box"" than some, but he goes for what the majority of travelers will want to see. Excellent for experienced and inexperienced travelers!"
2,to be ignored,"First of all RISE AGAINST is a great band, this poor DVD doesn't change that. The documentary is short and boring, and at some point seems to be more about the Vans Warped tour. Who cares what that dude from Thursday has to say about Tim's singing ?? You get to see a whole bunch of fans and their so-called lives ... boring, nobody wants to know that 40-something conservative republicans listen to RA !! I think that dude needs to read some of RA's lyrics. The live part is almost non-existing, 5 songs or so ... why not an entire show ?? The video's are pretty ok, but not to watch them over and over again. Next time better peeps !!"
5,You have to get one of these!,"I use these cables at least once a day if not more! You can use for listening to music through your tv (great for parties, no speakers in the way) and also to watch movies/tv shows from your ipod. Makes your ipod great as a storage unit for all your audio/video. Just slip this cable in your bag when you travel and you have all your favorite music and video at your fingertips when you travel! You can't beat the price, buy it now!"
2,Good for Audio but poor video,I bought to use with my iPod Video 5G. It transmitted good audio but lack of video quality. It tranfers only B/W display and also very blurry. I donot suggest for video tranfer.
1,Don't Buy,I was looking for a cord that would plug into my computer/ipod so I could play music at my desk while I work. This cord is a piece of crap. I've had it one week and it already only plays out of not even half of my set-up speakers (I have a denon reciever and a nice set of bose speakers). Even then it is touchy and will barely play out of the one bose tower it plays out of.
3,ipod classic owners beware!,"the new 80/160gb classics have a crippled video out function: they MUST be used with *apple brand* output cables/docks to allow the video out funciton to work. i bought this cable and it works perfectly for the audio output, but because of the MPAA, apple doesn't allow the new 80/160gb classics to put out video signal unless the cable or output device has a DRM-compliant apple chip in them. in other words, if you want a cable that will allow you to watch the video from your 80/160gb ipod classic on a scree bigger than the ipod's, you're going to be out another $50. this cable will work only for audio on the new classics."
5,"Works great, and was CHEAP","Great for taking on the road. Doesn't force you to find an s-Video port on old TVs like the Apple iPod dock. Arrived quickly, thanks guys!"
1,Not what I expected,So this only allowed me to hear music on my tv and nothing more. It said I could see pics and stuff but that was not the case. Sadly I bought.
5,Brooks all the way,"I have never had a better fitting/feeling shoe in my life. I've tried many other name brand shoes that cost WAY TOO MUCH $$. Brooks are now the only running shoe I will buy. Great stability, wonderful fit, great arch support and fabulous colors. What more could a gal want?!"
3,not the best brooks shoe,"This Brooks shoe, although cuter than the others, felt narrower, and had less motion control and stability than the other 5 pairs of Brooks I've owned."
4,Great for Giants fans,"Purchased this as a gift for my husband - a huge NY Giants fan. He will probably place it on his desk at work, so durability is not an issue. Shipping was timely and product is in excellent condition. He will love it on Christmas morning!"
5,Best HipHop I Have,"Every track on this is good...For hiphop I usually listen to Latyrx/Blacklicious, Erykah Badu, Common, very mellow stuff. But this is playing at my house constantly, especially when I'm getting ready to go out. Not too produced, so real, so well-written, totally fell in love with the entire album and play it all the time."
5,"ok, i lied, i havent read it","yeah, so, sue me. i just wanted to say that eva kor spoke to my class about her experiences in the holocaust. it was very touching. i live in illinois, and so does she! her story is very interesting, and i want to read this book, but i cant find it anywhere!!!! shoot."
3,Cold weather nailer,"I'm a professional, and can't recommend this as a production nailer. And in really cold weather it doesn't have the power for framing. However, I needed a nailer for nailing plywood in a freezer at 0-5 below. This wasn't a walk-in freezer. It's three times the size of a football field. So I nailed a lot of plywood and 1 by 6s, driving probably 200,000 nails. With the fork-lift traffic, hoses and cords were out of the question. This tool performed admirably, though I recommend sticking to the Paslode nails. The will-fits tend to jam up."
4,Great for my project,"So far this nailer has worked out great.I'ver never used a framing nailer before, so I have nothing to compare it to. Im currently framing some new partition walls in my basement and I plan on adding some additonal decking outside.The only thing feature that hasn't lived up to its specs is the amount of nails that it will drive on one fuel cell. It seems like it has only driven a little more than half the amount stated. However, I'm not disappointed because the fuel cells are inexpensive enough.I highly recommend it to any noncontractor that has a relatively light use for a framiung nailer. The cost to buy it makes more sense than renting a nailer and a compressor for more than a few days. Especially if you may have a future use for it."
5,Awsome!,"I own the framing gun and the trim gun.I am a maintenance director at a water theme park and get into a number of fix it quick type of jobs.Ive done some extensive remodeling of the offices,fences,and other structures around the park. The nail capacity of the framing gun could be bigger but over all its a very handy and reliable tool.The paperwork that comes with the tool states that it should not be used below 22 degrees so if your a northern carpenter,forget the winter jobs. Since it works off combustion during the summer in hotter temp, just take your time and let the gun breathe."
3,What Paslode retailers don't tell you.,"We've used Paslode Impulse Nailers for our framing crew since they first came out. We still have some of our first guns, from nearly ten years ago. Our crew is not easy on tools, so the tools have not been babied. The newer guns are not as good and the service sometimes leaves a lot to be desired. When I have complained to the reps I'm told that the tool is not for everyday framing, just for occasional use where pnuematic tools are inconvienent. This is what the retailers don't tell you when you buy them. They are not supposed to be a primary tool -- but that's how we use them anyway. We've learned to implement most repairs and cleaning on the job. It would be nice if Paslode would make the guns so they SHOULD be the primary tool."
2,Very handy tool when it's working,"I would like to inform anyone going to buy this tool to think about it very hard. I've had this gun for 2 years now and it's been back to the company 6 months out of the time I've owned it. In summer, when the temperature is above 90, it over heats. In winter when its below 20, the gas cylinder freezes. Dont get me wrong it's great when your nailing off roof sheeting, no hoses to trip over, but I think paslode has a lot of work ahead of them to make this a practicle tool for contractors."
1,expensive junk,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He opened the box read all the directions, put in the nails and it worked - once! After 1 nail went into the wood, it would not work again! He went to the troubleshooting pages of the instruction book, but, nothing helped. He now has to take it to an authorized dealer to get it fixed."
4,Generally pretty good.,"Rented one from a chain super center (the orange one), and have no regrets. In fact, if I had needed it beyond the one job, I probably would've returned it right away and just bought one. It worked reliably for the day. Battery life was good (not sure if it was fully charged, made it through a few hundred nails over about 8 hours from the time we started working to the time we ended), and was still on the original fuel cell when we finished up.If you already have an air compressor, you might as well buy a compressed-air nailer. But if you don't, or you're working in a spot where an air compressor would be either really inconvenient or impossible, it's not a bad deal.The only issue I found was that sometimes, even pressed down all the way, the gun wouldn't fire, no matter how hard the gun was pressed into the wood. Backing off all pressure and pressing the gun all the way down again would generally do it."
3,OWNER,"WAS LOOKING FOR A CORDLESS NAIL GUN. THIS GUN WORKS GOOD WITH NAILS 2 1/2 INCHES AND SHORTER BUT TI SHOWS IT CAN USE 3 1/4 AND THIS WAS A FALSE ADVERTIZING. IF YOU DON'T READ THE BOCKLET THAT COMES WITH THE GUN, WHICH I OVER LOOKED TO DO. IT SAYS GUN WILL NOT DRIVE 3 1/4 STAINLESS NAILS THREW PRESURED TREATED WOOD."
4,A Remodeler's Gun,"I run a residential remodeling company in the Boston area. The Paslode impulse framer is great for remodeling. I recently framed an adiition with it and it was wonderful not having a hose pulling on me when up in high places. The gun fires consistently and powerfully. I should point out I am not framing new houses and an addition is greatest amount of framing my company performs. The impulse framer is perfect for the limited framing involved in kithcen and baths, etc. and I would not trade it for a compressor and air gun for most of my work. But, the gun is completely unsuited for shooting down decks and sheathing. It will not bounce shoot (an advantage for toe nailing) which means rapid deck install is out. I would not buy this gun to knock out houses, but its the best choice for remodeling in general and is a godsend in tight places."
2,Not for High Altitudes,"Nice product, but not for high elevations. Building in the high country of Colorado (9,000') found the gun to be less than useful at anything longer than a 2 3/8"" nail. Anything longer than that requires additional nail setting with your hammer. (The ""thin air"" up here just doesn't have the kick needed to drive anything longer) If these were hand-drives, that would be no big deal, but as many know, gun nails can be difficult to set (they like to bend!!). This won't effect a lot of users, but it is worth mentioning to those who may purchase the gun to use at altitude."
5,Great Faming Nailer,"I bought this nail gun to finish a few rooms in my basement. The Paslode Framing Nailer worked flawlessly. It nailed pressure treated 2x4s perfectly. I didn't have a single problem with it.The only thing I didn't like was the exhaust that the gun produces. Since it works off of an actual explosion, it gives off an exhasut that can be a little overwhelming if your not working outside or have the windows open."
1,paslode problems,"I have the paslode cordless framer and the 15 ga. angled finish nailer. Both of these were puchased new in June of 2004. The trim gun has trimmed exactly 24 windows (with great trouble), the framer has approximatley 1-2 boxes of nails thru it (with a jam every 1-4 clips, provided your freehand rides the battery so it functions at all).Both of these guns have been returned to Gotham Staple in Columbus, Oh (factory repair center) twice for repair, to my dismay no repairs have been covered by warranty. Neither of the guns are in active service they just ride in the truck, with Gothams repair tags still on them. I WILL GLADLY LOAN BOTH OF THESE TOOLS TO ANYONE WHO IS CONSIDERING THIS PURCHASE,IN THE CENTRAL OHIO AREA, I'LL EVEN THROW IN SOME NAILS, NOT MANY BECAUSE YOU WON'T NEED THEM. Josh Hardbarger 740)507-5570"
3,cordless or air,the use of this would be only for the small projectbut if you had air or thought about air tools get the senco air framing nailers.the pasload is great to shoot a few nails but other than that get air
1,Stay away,"Warning. You will be wasting your hard earned dollars if you purchase this. I bought two. One is now an expensive paperweight. It needs a replacement electronic module which, after a few nails stopped functioning. It costs too much to service, and the warranty won't cover it. Save your money!"
3,Only for the small jobs,"I have used the Paslode framing nailers for two years and had it in the shop three times and repaired it myself several other times.I have had to replace the rings twice and had to have the fan motor re-wired. The tool must be oiled before every use and during use if doing more than a couple hours of work. I would not recommend it for daily use or large jobs, only occasional piecework. It provides great convenience when power is not available or you don't want to drag out the aircompressor."
4,cleaning a must,"this is one the best nailers out there but the cleaning is very important . i noticed alot of misfires and also the fan coming on alot , i took it apart and it was very dirty. after i cleaned it , it worked like it was brand new . one very big plus is the fact the you do not need compresser .enough said so if you are looking for a good nailer buy it you will not be unsatisfied"
5,The features make up for the speed.,"I ran about 10000 3 1/4"" and ring shank nails through this tool(only Paslode nails). And while it won't keep up with the speed of an air unit the convenience makes up for it. For big jobs you need an air unit, I use this for small jobs 50 nails or less. I've never cleaned it or did any maintainace and I've yet to have a problem with it. After 4 cases of nails I'm still on my 3rd fuel cell. This product delivered exactly what I expected from it and I wouldn't give it up. The case is well designed but the charger is not so hot."
4,Not what you think it is.,"It is unfortunate that so many of these great independent bands never get heard by anyone important. This hypercolonic blend of ambiant soundworks and driving keybords blends perfectly with the vocal musings of singer/songwriter Jason Elbogen, where, the caffeine injected tune ""Cup of Coffee"", gives me the jitters, whenever I hear it, and I don't even drink coffee anymore. Alas some of the songs are overly long, fall short and remind the listener that the Kings are no Led Zeppelin just yet, but in time, as those who love them here in Chapel Hill, NC await the next release we can only hope."
5,sic.,"Simply the best album I have heard, Even though there is only seven tracks on this album,the sound that they bring to the table is off the charts. The front man Curtis shamlin Is by far one of the best vocalists I have ever Heard. If your a fan of Korn, Slipknot, Deftones and mudvayne, You have got to hear this album. Gryp disbanded shortly after this album. The lead Curtis Shamlin now fronts the band called Last To Die. So If you like Metal or you like hardcore, buy this album! you wont be disappointed."
1,Worked for 6 months,"When I first purchased this alarm I thought it was wonderful, but it was too good to be true. The transmitter intermittently fails on a daily basis. If it is below freezing outside it rarely works. If it is raining it will not work at all. I am very frustrated. Customer support does not even respond. I wish there was a better product, but I think they are the only game in town (so to speak)."
2,Dakota Alert Motion sensor/driveway,"This item is currently (5/7/10) back at the manufacturer's. It did not work as advertised. It was supposed to sense motion at a range of 20 ft from a driveway, but it was more like 3 ft. In addition, the range is supposed to be 600 ft, but this one was about 125ft--when it worked. The item was compared to the exact model which a friend owns, and his worked as advertised. I phoned the manufacturer's tech support 3 times with no change in the unit. I was finally advised to return it to them for a possible total makeover.One bit of information, NOT in the instructions is that the unit requires either Energizer or Duracell batteries, not store brand. It seems store brands are not powerful enough to drive the unit. Even when these batteries were used, the unit did not function properly.I am hoping the manufacturer will get the unit operating properly."
1,"Quit after, three weeks",I received my Dakota alert mid August 2011. I spent a few days deciding how and where to mount it and building a water proof bird style house to keep it covered up. I used it right out of the box without changing anything. It was mounted about 8 feet off the ground pointing down across the drive way about 250 feet from the house. It worked great for about 3 weeks and quit! I have returned it to amazon for refund.
1,Completely unreliable,"Product advertised as having 600' range--range is actually less than 100', and does not work well through walls. Motion detection area is very narrow and inconsistent. Tried to find a way to give 0 stars, but site wouldn't allow it."
2,We had to send it back!!!,Just plain and simple it did not work and we had to send it back. The return process was very simple but it still remains that we had to be inconvenienced to send it back. We will definitely not buy another item from this company.
5,Intrusion Sensor,"This is a great system for covering areas of poor or no visability. To date, it has worked flawlessly."
1,unreliable,quit working after a short time. it will recognize motion but fails to transmit. Other dakota products are porne to water getting to the electronics. you have to apply your own sealant to keep the rain out
5,Motion detector,Have had this detector installed for about 3 weeks and works flawlessly so far. It is mounted on a gate post at the entrance to our property and is about 700 feet from the house and there are many trees on the lot. The trees don't seem to affect it. Never misses. Does detect deer also but that is a minor inconvenience. Previously had a cheaper detector that did not perform reliably.
3,Good,"This purchase was a second reciever. The technology is very good, much more reliable that our previous driveway monitor. However after about 9 months the transmitter had some issues, had to be returned. I'm not sure if it was replaced or repaired. Tech support was a little ""iffy""."
3,Good if you can take many false alarms,"Great volume control.Nice different sounds. But with all the adjustments made I still had way too many false alarms.There where no deer,tree's,other cars or people that could affect this unit. I mean it worked perfectlly when it worked. But it also worked just as imperfectlly."
3,Awesome at first,"This product was a welcome addition to our existing security system. It worked great for about two month. Suddenly it started ""going off"" all the time; then it completely died. We only used it for about 4 months. So sad, it's still mounted on our tree as a deterrent... haha!"
1,Expensive failure,"Mine didn't work out of the box, ok, sent it back and they put a new part in it at no charge. I have moved both units several times all over the house and yard. Now I'm about 200' from the house. This is the most unreliable tooll I own, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. yes I've experimented with the sun, height and went through the controls in the instruction manual,,,,many times. Sometimes it will go off or not with the same vehicle passing by, next time it does nothing.I thought I bought the best.Amazon was great and I highly recommend using them but save money and buy something else. My inlaws bought a $25 cheapie at walmart and that thing works like a million bucks."
5,Must have,"I had a driveway monitor that died after 10 years. That exact product weas no longer available. Iwasted money the Chamberlain Model CWA2000. It wasreally bad. Too common of a ring tone to alert you and not very loud even for $69 Bucks plus shipping. So I ordered the Dakota WR 3000. Easy install,choice of 4 ringtones, volume as well as on/off switch. A few dollars morebut it's a great feeling to know when someone is entering you property,coming near your vehicle....especially late at night. A MUST for all."
1,Could be better,"Bought my first one in '97. Lasted (reliably) for a couple years then quit. Quit because water got inside even with O-Ring seal on cover. Sent it back (after warrantee expired) for replacement. They charged me about 1/3 less than new. New one lasted about 1.5 years before quitting - same issue, moisture inside. Someone somewhere must make a reliable unit that does NOT quit after a year or so."
3,A little below what i expected for the money,"when it works it is awesome. during the winter the alert works sporadically when it is cold (below 40-45 degrees) unfortunately, i live in area where this temperature is 3-4 months out of the year. We even enclosed the sensor in a wooden box with plexy glass in front of the eye to keep it out of the elements."
2,Mediocre,"It usually doesn't work when someone drives in, but goes off when no one is there. I wouldn't recommend this."
4,Glad we purchased!,"We bought this as we have dogs..and like to know when someone has pulled in, we have warning before someone rings doorbell.. and the dogs run to the door...especially when it is solicitors !! :-)Works great.. When waiting for someone to arrive...don't have to keep looking out the window.Nice sounding alarm too!"
4,Wireless Motion Alert Kit,With our home setting back off the road and we were also having quite a few strangers pulling up to our home so we thought a driveway alarm would be a good idea. I purchased the Wireless Dakota Alert system and I am very pleased with the results. We hear the alarm when someone pulls up and we have time to look to see who it is before they even get out of their cars. I would purchase this product again.
3,Driveway Sensor,The distance for sensing was only around 30 feet and the speaker sound wasn't very good at low volume and terrible at high volume.
3,What If the Soviets....,"Written in 1985, Barbarossa Red is a flashback to the Cold War tensions I was all too aware of growing up. There was a great deal of fiction in the 70's and 80's that dealt with the Cold War gone hot. This effort takes its time to heat up as the majority deals with espionage and political intrigue. It eventually leads to a Soviet Pact invasion of West Germany that provides some decent action (remember Leopard tanks, Saracen armored cars, Tornado jets?). The conflict is rapidly resolved after the not-so-thrilling spy plot is deciphered. A good retro read."
2,I was disappointed with this book.,"I was disappointed with this book, because it was not much more than an American cold war propaganda stab at the Russians. It was a ""big bad Russians"" and ""poor brave Americans"" kind of tale, and I did not find it interesting at all. I would not recommend it to people interested in the Cold War."
1,Not Needed,"There is really no reason for a photographer to buy this, a bounce card (which is built into the 580EX) serves the same purpose when one isn't using direct strobe and one should rarely if ever use direct strobe in shooting. You're wasting your money, especially $11 for something that is really just translucent plastic."
1,Does not fit,I have a canon 580EX and I can't get the Omni-Bounce to fit onto it. It is way too tight. Get a different one.
3,"Ok, warm tint","If this was $4 it would be 4-5 stars. For $15 it's hard to not feel like you're being taken advantage of. It works. It softens the light (and decreases the light output). Unfortunately it also changes the color of the light. The auto-white balance setting on cameras that get color info from the flash will make things too red, but that's easy enough to fix later. I hardly ever use it since my walls and ceiling are white and I get a much nicer effect bouncing the flash when indoors."
4,"Get one, practice a little, you'll love it","With shipping and all, was under $15. Very reasonable. It works and is now one of the tools in my arsenal. If you do much flash photography, get one and practice and you'll learn when the OmniBounce can make shots look amazingly better with its blend of bounced plus ""bare bulb"" direct and indirect light. It's not for every shot, but it'll help many of them so show more details and nice kicklight in the eyes."
5,Good Product for Price,The product from this seller came very fast and in good packaging. This Stofen is great to diffuse flash and bounce/diffuse. Small and light and great to have in certain situations. I think everyone should have one. Especially since they are inexpensive.
4,Good compact diffuser,"It is small and it does the job. I basically leave it on my flash most of the time. However, it is still a relatively small light source, so the light quality will not compare to i.e. a softbox."
3,LONG WAIT...,"I waited longer than i'd hoped for delivery. Other than that, the bounce diffuser arrived as described."
4,"Works well, but the fitment is not ideal","I am using this on an Canon Speedlite 580EX II flash. The diffuser works and I am pleased with the light dispersion, however the fitment on the flash is not ideal and I had to basically jam the thing on - with that said, the diffuser is secure and I have had no issues with it falling off or anything of that nature. The fitment is a minor inconvenience given that it is accomplishing what I want it to."
4,"A little expensive for a piece of plastic, but...","This item is a little expensive, but it does just what it is suppose to do and it does it well. It is quite easy to get studio looking images without a lot of extra lights and other equipment when it is used on a good camera and used as intended."
3,Hmmmmm!,Kind of a tight fit. works ok with flash pointed up. worth the money? sure.Love firefighterphotojunky
5,a GOOD BOUNCE,"This item is a great value, it works well. I have received the item faster than I thought"
3,Does what it supposed to but price sux,Yeah this Diffuser does what its supposed to but the price is a rip off and the shipping and handling on top of that makes this a huge rip off. But I need a professional looking Diffuser so I bought it. 3 stars because its a rip off.
2,"Does exactly what its name suggests, nothing more.","I got one of these omni-bounce flash attachments in a kit I bought on here. Granted, it does its job, it spreads light everywhere. However, it's too good at it. It puts light where you don't want it, thus reducing the amount of light output of your flash. I tried it once to test it out, and never used it since. It's now a convenient tray for batteries or other small things. This is NOT a replacement for a soft-box or shoot-through umbrella.1 star for the idea.1 star for being an omnidirectional light-spreader.0 stars for light-control.0 stars for usefulness.0 stars for guide-number reduction while in use."
3,Another piece of plastic...,"I guess this is just another over-priced piece of plastic made for my Canon flash which I can't ""live"" without it..."
1,cheap gimmick,"it literally is just a piece of plastic. That's all. A cheap little gimmick that shouldn't cost more than $ 2. I tried it with the 580 EX II and didn't like the effect. Not really diffusion, just muffles the light, you still see the actual flash in a window i.e. I cannot recommend it."
2,Disappointed.,I tried this on my external flash and I actually like the pictures my flash produces without this thing on.
4,Simple,"This diffuser is not bad. It does fit very nicely on my Canon 580EX II flash. The fit is snug, but not too tight. And it is very simple to toss into my camera bag and use it about anywhere.The down side to this is diffusion. It just isn't big enough to create big wide soft light that wraps around your subject. It's a huge improvement over direct flash, but it isn't the same thing as a softbox or umbrella. If you don't mind a bigger diffuser, the Gary Fong series is a much better choice (Gary Fong C4 Cloud Lightsphere II, Inverted Dome Flash Diffusion System.) although much more expensive. This also requires a reflective ceiling or walls to bounce light off of. And there is at least a 2 stop price to pay for the diffuser.In general, this is a good, inexpensive device to carry in your camera bag. It does soften the harsh light of a flash. But it just doesn't do as great a job as the Gary Fong diffusers."
5,Excellent Resource!,I purchased this book when my daughter was prenatally diagnosed with Spina Bifida. Since she's been born I have purchased more copies for family members. This book is an excellent resource for parents and loved ones. It teaches about the condition and related concerns in an easy to understand manner. This is by far the best book I have found on Spina Bifida. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is expecting/has a child with Spina Bifida. I would also recommend it for family members and caregivers of children with Spina Bifida.
4,"Flawed, but original and brave","When it's good, it's terrific, including an amazing performance by a very young Elle Fanning as amentally troubled 8 year old, and good work by Felicity Huffman, and the always wonderfulPatricia Clarkson.On the other hand, the very talented Campbell Scott is reduced to playing a one note joke, andthe tone of the film is all over the place; odd quirky comedy one moment, a child contemplatingsuicide the next.But the real problems are when the film's Lifetime network roots show through, and suddenly there'sthat warm, fuzzy, phony feeling that being a kid with severe emotional problems isn't all that bad,and everything will be just fine. It undermines the film's valiant attempts to really get inside astruggling kid's head.None-the-less, in a world of cookie-cutter filmmaking, the film gets real points for trying, andabout 80% of the time, this is a very good, and very original film."
5,Wonderful Movie!,"This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I'm usually not someone who makes recommendations, but this is a movie I highly recommend."
2,Phoebe in Wonderland,"I recently rented this movie, mostly due to my interest in the famous Lewis Carol's book. The movie is about a young girl struggling with a psychological disorder while she becomes involved with a school play. I found the acting to be mediocre at best and the script to be unrealistic. Many of the children don't behave as you expect children to behave. The mother and father are overly-emotional (especially the mother) and don't even get me started about the drama teacher, yikes. The principal and the psychiatrist provide some unintentional comedic relief, but not much. For those interested in Lewis Carol's book, there's not much for you here. For others, I do not recommend this one unless you like sappy movies."
2,So aware of acting,"This was an ok film - but I was SO aware of the 'acting' going on that it wasn't believable for me. I thought Bill Pullman, although he didn't have many scenes, the most believable. Elle Fanning . . . in my mind I kept seeing the director say, ""now ACTION"".She got on my nerves with her 'so perfect' diction and wide-eyed wonder at everything. And Felicity Huffman, I guess if she changes her hair color it makes her a better actor - but not here. Patricia Clarkson's character was just plain silly. I felt like I so wasted my time watching this movie."
5,need a little help here,Hello I just mainly need some info if yall can help me did tim wilson do a spin off song from snoop doggy dogs song gin and juice if so i would love to know the title to the album its on i have all the albums but hillbilly homeboy and i love them all but if you could help me with this problem ???? thanks for your time Adam
5,I love this Movie,Marissa Tomei does a wonderful acting job in this movie that has such great music. I have the Music CD also.
3,Perez Family,"As a fan of director, Mira Nair, I really looked forward to seeing this movie with a unique story line. While it was interesting, I did not feel the material met her previous high levels of expertise, and felt a little campy and overdone here and there. I thought most of the acting was well done, especially Angelica Huston, and Alfred Molina, and Chazz Palminteri. I am also a huge fan of Marissa Tomei, but was disappointed in her role her. She played her character in such an exaggerated manner that it almost felt cartoonish, although I felt she improved as the movie progressed. Her Cuban enthusiasm and zest for life felt overdone, overplayed, which detracted from the essential drama of the refugee story being told. I also felt the costuming could have been more realistic, more appropriate to the income level of the people portrayed. (MT's sugar cane costume was over the top!! a caricature!) Lots of plusses, but a few too many minuses. It falls far short of being great.Pru McDonald"
2,Very simple book and full of serious errors,"I am sure that, I wouldn't have bought this book if someone had reviewed this book before me.Briefly, if you are looking for a deep information on several brand firewall's configuration and especially on VPN subject, belive, this book is not for you.The first half of the book is full of with just generic information which almost avery avarage IT people have. That is, whithin a few minutes you pass the first two part.Than you decide your point on this book while reading the VPN part. No detail on the issues, no real time application samples and most important one completely wrong several figures.For example, on page 247 figure 5.20 says ""MPLS Packet Structure"", but you see screen snapshot of Putty telnet application's configuration window. I honestly couldn't understand if they are joking or have another purpose.My only advice, always prefer the books you can look inside it."
2,Nothing monumental,"There wasn't anything really new in this particular CD from other chanting CDs. The intention was nice (gave him a star for that), but the voice lacked strength and resonance which is what makes the chanting really come alive for me. Not top in it's class, probably won't give it a third or fourth play."
4,above average for a rap album,"T-Rock managed to put out a decent album even after leaving Three 6 Mafia's Hypnotize Camp Posse. It's not wonderful, and the best thing about it is the beats, but T-Rock has good delivery and is somewhat intelligent about lyrics at times. All too often, though, it's what you'd hear out of a typical rap album. But at least there's variety."
1,Oy Vey!,"It's so refreshing to see that Spunk Man P has cleaned up his act and graduated from rehab and is now making amends to all those whom he hurt while he was under the influence. And although I appreciate the effort, I just don't think this album of Yiddish lullabies sung a capella is going to appeal to his particular demographic. If he must do this kind of stuff, he needs to drop the old gangsta moniker and genuinely convert to the Hebrew religion. Maybe then people will take this new turn seriously. As it is, it just seems like some silly stunt and passing fashion. I'll see you at the bris, Spunk Man."
3,a picture book,I am a huge Maxfield Parrish fan and thought that this would be just wondefful. It wasnt and it isnt. It is like any other pop up book for children althought most wouldnt know the subject matter. From now on I read between the lines before ordering.
4,Cute,"I have these two of these for my kids, pink flowers and green dinos, it makes my kids feel special. The quality is good, wood and the ribbon is very strong, they have withheld 3 years now and many moves around the room. The stickers have never fallen off. Good price also."
5,"Fun, colorful and sturdy!","I love this name plaque- we bought one for our older son a few years ago and just ordered this one for our youngest. They love having their name on their door and the dinosaurs are different on both plaques so they each have their own design. Melissa & Doug is a great company that makes excellent quality wooden toys/products for kids. Using the plaque teaches your child how to spell their name and teaches them a sense of ownership and pride in something that is ""theirs"". Putting their name on the plaque with them is also a fun little project."
4,Cool one,"This George Benson album might be one of his most forgotten ones. Beeing a fan over the years, i can say that this is actually a very fine piece of work from George....smooth and elegant. The album is as always well produced, musicans at top class, and the man himslef deliver as always. What this album miss, is the ones that could lift this album up to where it deserves. It is hard to actually mention a highlight here..but..""Stephanie""...""let's do it again""...and ""Tender love""...is Benson as we know him from the pop/soul 80's albums he made. Pity really, the lack of the hit here, but the album stands as an fine example for smooth pop/soul..r&b.;It is far from Bensons best, but it is worth the money. To lend your ears to George Benson....sets you in the mood..the good mood."
2,I feel that this book is out dated.,This book had a copy right date of 1988. She doesn't believe in imprinting. Handling the foal til late. I can't believe that she waits to 18 months to lunge a horse. I was very unhappy with the book.
3,Help in horse training,"This book has some very good information, however the author does train in some ways that I can't agree with. Hobbling a horse is just something I can't agree with. The book doese have some very good information in how to bond witha young colt."
1,The Absolute Worst book I've EVER bought,"I was so disappointed in this book. I have bought many horse books, but this one was certainly the worst. I think it is a pitty that force and strength is substituted for time and patience and really *teaching* a young horse to be confident and trusting rather than be afraid and just submit while it cant move, being tied in hobbles...every lesson praticly was introducing hobbles. I thought it was disgusting. If anyone would STILL like to buy the book, you can take mine for half price!kmrothmann@aol.com"
3,Unethical,"The book is very informative for the purpose of writing a business plan for a start-up business. It allows one to cut right to the chase and get about the business of writing your plan without having to wade through a lot of material having nothing to do with your business. I also appreciate that it doesn't assume prior knowledge in business terminology, marketing, or finance. On the minus side, I felt the title of the book was very misleading, because there is no way a person can do a business plan in 60 minutes unless it is writing a plan which has already been planned, researched, evaluated, revised, and all supporting documents assembled. The CD ROM is also of no use to me as all it contains is the Business plan in the back of the book. I have turned to other sources to fine tune my resulting plan."
1,Look elsewhere,The type of business plan that was depicted in this book was related only to a manufacturing concern and had no usefulness to other types of businesses. The CD that was included was of no use as well. So if you think this book will help you write a business plan in 60 minutes....good luck!
3,Ok,"Steves ignores too many important cities, and I was shocked to see him refer to Beaune but not Dijon, and not even mention Nancy or Metz.It is an userfriendly guide and he offers excellent itineraries, but the book is based on a single person's opinions and views (which explains his casual manner for excluding/including cities). Don't let this be your only guidebook in France, but it is handy to have in conjunction with others. I enjoyed the easy reading and the honest recommendations and it isn't as weighty as the Lonely Planet or bland as Fodor's. But, I am still shocked that Steves completely ignored a number of France's great and beautiful provincial cities."
2,"Tiny Photos, Tiny Index",Photos are very few and about an inch square. Index is ridiculously small. Pick any place or thing name in the book and only 1 in 20 are in the index.
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I wish I could review this book, but the copy I received said France on the front, and the book inside was actually for Tuscany. I am still waiting for the promised replacement copy. Amazon.com was not interested in checking the other copies they had on hand for similar errors so there may be others out there that are not as they first appear!"
3,Whats the rush about?,"I bought the original Ideal album last year and boy wasn't I amazed at how good these guyz were, not only 'get gone' but also creepin, ..I loved the whole album in short and it would make a great gift for your girlfriend ..BOYZ! But..do I have to go back to the store and buy the same album again just coz of a few remixed songs and a new smash hit? I don't think so. Buy the single? Maybe but naah. The producers of this new cd, In my opinion, are rushing things abit too much. 'Whatever' would have made a good ..'followup to their debut album' smash hit. Now they act like ideal will never produce anothe smash hit and the one they produce is re-released with their album. Its just not fair for me to buy two ideal album almost the same. What was the rush all about? Somebody tell me...."
4,A good book of the architect of the moment!,"Some people say Siza is the architect of the white! Probably, if whe can understand that the white colour of his facades is the consequence of his absolutly control of plans and forms. He is a genius! This book is a good way to show almost all works of Siza. For me there is only one book that is better than this one: ""Alvaro Siza - the book, from ElCroquis"".But anyway, buy this book if you want to understand the genius of Alvaro Siza."
4,Intriguing music!,"I love musical fusion, blending one style with another, using different instruments in different genres, etc. This is a truly interesting mix of cultures.Not every number is a winner for me, but everyone is a great example of musical experimentation. I definitely value the attempt on every number, and I absolutely immediately loved many of the tracks! Akete Oba Oba is wonderful. I adore Tail Wag Jig and Reel 'En Su Salsa'. Others have taken longer for me to appreciate, but more than one listen can make the ears yearn for more.The average 'guy-on-the-street' might not find this CD to their liking. I highly recommend it to the musically adventurous. I think it would be great to play this kind of music in schools to expose high school students to more varieties of sound.Why limit ourselves to the same old stuff when we can enjoy the world of music in Planet Soup?"
1,So. Awful.,"I had to read this book for a class. In it, it states that birth control causes infertility, which is hardly true with modern birth control. Though with some, there can be a delay after prolonged usage, it is not a large problem. However, they did cite this source! It was cited ""survey of five women"". That breaks just about every statistical rule I've ever learned. It also at one point made some sort of assumption that most men have never touched a plant. Also, if they had a proofreader s(he) was probably drunk the whole time. There were so many typos in the book!"
1,Tunestir AM/FM Receiver,"FYI: The photo displayed as of August 5, 2005, shows the Tunestir AM/FM receiver (white), not the 3-in-one (green). As for the AM/FM receiver, the transmitter does not work well in the car - the sound is very low no matter what frequency you tune it to. When playing the receiver, it makes the backlight on the iPod go on and off randomly."
4,Back to Basics Latin,"While there is nothing glitzy about this set of videos, I think the teaching is solid. They are intended to be used along with the Latin Primer I workbook and teacher manual. The teacher guides the student through the lesson, as she goes through pronunciation, chants (verb conjugations) and instructions for doing the worksheets. This program is an absolute godsend to parents who want to teach Latin without an extensive knowledge of it themselves. It also helps kids to see that other kids are capable of doing the work. A classroom of students inpressively illustrate that throughout. Latin Primer I does a great job presenting vocabulary (nearly 400 words), along with 1st and 2nd declensions. Well worth the investment for parents of 2nd to 4th graders."
4,for sure among my top 20 albums ever,"I am not sure if this is the right album for fans of early Van Halen, but it certainly shows an interesting aspect of Steve Vai's work. It is his ability to turn a straight forward rock/pop album into something special. ""Skyscraper"" is not as weird and wild as some of Steve Vai's solo work, but he puts in that extra special edge and feel. The recording has been criticized often for its many overdubs and technicality. A matter of taste...I like it that way - cerainly nothing for the average grunge-one-take ""listen, I-can't play"" person.If you like this, check out one of the later Whitesnake albums with Steve Vai as guitarist.""Skyscraper"" is one of those albums that go well with driving into a sun set with an open roof and an open sky."
5,thums up,thumbs up YEAA AAAAA A AA A A AAA AAAAAAA HHHHH HH HH HH H HHHHH HHHH HHHHHHHfd gddddddddddddddd ddddddd
5,Forgotten and underrated,"This album is not remembered well except for the hit single ""Just Like Paradise"", which is unfortunate because there is some great playing on this one. Steve Vai on guitar and Billy Sheehan on bass make a great combination. They are masters of their instruments and it shows in this album. The best songs, if you're looking to buy just the part of the album are the hits ""Just Like Paradise"" and ""Stand up"" (of course), the title track ""Skyscraper"" (sting like a B-52...), Damn Good (break out your high school yearbook when you listen to this song about nostalgia), and ""Hina"" which features creative use of delay effects on the guitar. ""Perfect Timing"" is also pretty catchy if you want something more upbeat. The other songs have some good moments too, get it and enjoy it.-Gary Letona"
4,Great CD!,"This CD gets a lot of flack, but it is great. It is not as heavy as EEAS, but Steve Vai rips it on this one. Buy it for the great tunes it has."
5,Oh please...,"I remember when this album came out, I was in heaven to hear Vai play and the album is a must have for any guitar loving fan."
3,The Start of the Decline,Skyscraper is a decent follow up to Eat 'Em And Smile. There is some good energy on the record. Just Like Paradise is fairly catchy even with a few unnecessary synthesizer touches. Knucklebones is a good edgy tune as is Too Fools A Minute. The later features Steve Vai's best guitar work on the record.Many of the other songs are pretty unremarkable. Too much synthesizer and not enough raw rock n roll. Dave's engaging personality does not shine through as on previous Van Halen releases and the first two solo efforts.Sadly it would only get worse from here.
2,A disappointment for David,"This third album of former Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth's was OK but no big hit like the predecessors CRAZY FROM THE HEAT AND EAT 'EM AND SMILE. This album spawned one Top 20 hit in early 1988,JUST LIKE PARADISE. Again,Roth has his ""secondary Van Halen"",who are none of his former bandmates. But this album was distributed by Warner Bros. just like his Van Halen predecessors(this album was released in '88,ten years after his former band's debut). Cool album,though!"
4,Dave Climbs High Again,"Dave slipped off pace from Eat Em and Smile, but the album was very enjoyable. A true DLR fan would take the album for what it is, and thats 10 songs of good music.I admit some songs are sloppier than others, but songs like Knucklebones, Hina, and Stand Up, give you a taste of that classic DLR style.If you want this album to be as good as Van Halen and Van Halen 2 you better lower the bar, Van Halen 1 and 2 are musical MASTERPEICES! Skysraper is only a HIT! (to say the least)FYI this album is more KEYBOARD focused. So a hard rockin guitar style... you won't find."
2,Doesn't do the job,"This shaver only works on short or fine hair. If your hair is long (more than 1/4 inch) or coarse, it just skips over the hair and doesn't do anything. I've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors."
1,Very Poorly Made,One I started using the shaver it fell apart. It has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just don't work. The shaver is a waste of money.
1,fall out,"this product is pure cosmetic with onlay a low profile function.when first in usage it fell apart right away, skin feeling is not good at all, noise level high, in short: nice andhandy design with a lack of technical workmanship. made in china, can't recommend it to someone else"
2,Ok item for the price,The razor is good but doesn't hold a charge well. The first one a received however was messed up. Somehow the cord was melted together but the package was not damaged and was sealed shut. I did mail it in a got the replacement very fast and I had a no hassle exchange. So all and all it was good.
1,Item did not fit stapler - product code matched stapler but staples do not work.,"I am quite disappointed that the staples do not work in stapler although the codes match. The original stapler and staples were purchased through Uline and codes match but staples do not work. Amazon was cheaper but if they don't work, it's not cheaper!"
3,They work but....,"Briefly; good value (especially as an Amazon Prime member) and they do work, but not as well as the original staples that came with my Stanley Bostitch P6C stapler. Every time I squeeze the stapler it now emits a loud crack, as if the anvil(?) is getting caught on the second staple then releases with great force. It now requires more pressure to squeeze the handles than it did before. I will have to go through 5000 staples and then try a different brand."
4,Classic Wedding Music,"Have owned this CD for several years now. My wife and I often play it in the car on the way to weddings and funerals. The songs are timeless, the performance very tasteful."
2,I Do Wedding CD - For Brides,"The CD is okay. I think that it would be okay for my wedding if I had nothing else to use. However, I am going to go with another choice because you can hear the man breathing in some of the pieces. It is this sharp, nasal noise. I don't think the quality of the CD is very good, maybe cheap recording? The instrumental aspect is nice, and I hate to be negative, but I was disappointed. If it was 10.00 and not for a wedding ceremony, I would probably rate it higher. However, because it was more and it is for a wedding, I have to give it 2. Sorry Gary!!"
3,Too Little Too Late,"After years of listening to the two previous Zappa guitar cds, I was not very moved by this release. Frank is soloing over many of the same vamps and changes but his playing lacks the inventiveness of the earlier recordings. The segues and editing from track to track are not nearly as seamless as Zappa was capable of. I suspect this was a result of a man exhausted from fighting a devastating illness. Chunga's Revenge being a favorite theme would have been nice to hear with Frank exclusively instead of Dweezil. Dweezil has alot of chops but he ain't sayin' nothin'. A bunch of empty notes. Listen to the original album for this track and Transylvania Boogie. Frank's guitar is testifying!"
3,"Ladies and Gentlemen,... the insrument known as the guitar.","Frank Zappa is known to be one of the greatest artists ever in terms of originality, diversity and skill. While this album most certainly demonstrates the skill aspect to Zappa's music, one who doesn't like instrumental music, or one who enjoys a varying sound on an album should consider one of his other releases, for this album focuses profoundly on the guitar. Composed of various live performances throughout the 1970s and 1980s, this album is nothing but long and eccentric guitar solos. While the first half of the album blows you away, the second half feels like a deja vu and unfortunately, this album is pretty repetitive. It is a great listen and a worthy collection of music, but it gets old fast..."
4,Excellent,"If you listen in order to the three Zappa guitar sets,Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar,Guitar (2 Cd)and this, you'll hear Zappa's axe playing getting denser and denser as the 1970s went into the 80s.Trans-Fusion is mostly mid-1980s solos, and contains the master's best work on the six-string. It is like he is litterally trying to orchestrate the music with his playing.His guitar work is layers and layers and layers. Zappa does not rest for even half a bar. At times it sounds like two or three players are working at once--even his trasitions between notes and phrases pack amazing sounds if not music.Zappa's guitar playing improved through his career, and these late solo's are an example in structural density--thick as beems holding up a bridge.And also rock."
2,Zapped,"No Doubt that Frank was a huge influence on my life ( who could imagine? )from the earliest Mothers. But this must appeal to guitar players more than me; I can listen to Robert Fripp, John McClaughlin and Jeff Beck for hours but this seems repetitive and boring. Can I end this review with an Apostrophe?"
1,Different color than advertised,"I ordered this because my daughter has one and I wanted another one for the baby. I was excited because it was pink and white, the colors of the nursery. Unfortunately when it arrived it was a green background and multi-colored flowers. I am very disappointed that it wasnt the door plate advertised here."
4,Cute,This product is nice. The stickers need a little hard pushing to get them to stay put. For the price you can't beat it.
5,Well done,"This film was very well done. They do not make any speculations, everything they discussed was proven with evidence to back it. Legislatures ARE planning to implement Geo-engineering, it's just a matter of WHEN. Although there is lots of evidence that it is already being done. Look up in the sky and you may see them in your area. These people are not trying to get rich off of these videos, they ask you to make as many copies as you can and to give them out for FREE."
5,Interesting,"I thought this movie was going to be about pesticides, but it actually a lot more interesting then that. I gives us a scary view of the world and asks the question of where or not we are ready to control the weather."
1,oh my god.. i have no words to describe how bad this is.,What happened to Steven Seagal? I was a HUGE fan!! Now.. he is too fat to film his own fight scenes. It sounds like they dubbed his voice. They actually used the same shot of him standing still throughout the fight scene. They flashed back and forth so quick during the fight you could not figure out what was going on. His acting SUCKS! He can't move! ... How pathetic. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FLOP!!
1,Give the Money Away at the Bottom of Freeway Offramp. You'll have more fun!!!,"I'm a big Steven Seagal fan, but this film was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was non-existent. The acting was atrocious. And the fight scenes were so far over the top, they were unbelievable. Not only does one of the two serial killers in this film get thrown for a 4th story window and survive with no major injuries, only to go on killing, the fight scenes were edited using ""replay"" (repeat of blow or impact 3 or 4 times). After the first couple of times, you want it to stop-- desperately. Also, the end of the movie is edited so that key information is left out. The ending makes absolutely no sense at all to viewer."
1,Makes me miss Ed Wood,"Wow this was bad. This is the first time I've felt compelled to post a review for a movie, that's how bad it was. A porcine Seagal, complete with some kind of odd southern accent. Obvious stunt double. Gratuitous fight scenes that go on forever with Seagals innumerable punches and kicks seeming to have no real effect on the bad guys. Cut and jerky stop motion photography. Inexplicable ending that seems to have been inserted as an after-thought. Just a bad movie from start to finish. Kind of like the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of the action movies."
2,Disappointing,"I have read many reviews of Seagal's DTV releases, and I have seen some of the movies, including this one. The main problem, as I see it, is that you can't hear what he is saying. He mumbles instead of speaks. I don't know about anyone else, but if I am watching a movie and the actor says something, I want to be able to hear what he says without having to turn the volume WAY UP first. I bought this movie, and watched it once, but I'm not sure if I will watch it again. I think if they could just work out the SOUND problems, they would come a long way in making his latest DTV releases more watchable."
4,Give it a chance,"Oh Steven, how the kind of mighty have not really fallen that far.I happen to be a huge Steven Seagal fan. Sad, I know, but this movie was actually relatively good considering what he's been putting out lately. Don't expect a lot and you'll be pleasantly surprised. If you watch this expecting ""Under Siege"" or ""Above the Law"" then you'll be disappointed. I've seen most of his movies and this is far superior to a few others he's done in the past. If you're considering it, my advice is to give it a chance."
3,A well written story from Seagal,"Thought this was one of the better written DTV releases from Seagal that I have seen yet. The story was quite interesting and even reminded me of Glimmer Man a little. If it was not for all the voice dubbing I would have given it a 4 star review. Seemed like nearly half of the movie his voice was altered, which was a turn off along with some of the fight scenes were one of them dragged on nearly 15 minutes. I realize Mr. Seagal is busy but if he is going to make movies it would be nice to see him do all his own work vs. the body doubles and voice alterations. Outside of that, pretty decent movie.Peter J. Miller"
1,What happened Segal ??,"I was a fan of Segal back in the day, but its been years since I seen him in a movie......now I know why !!!To keep it short ""ITS BAD"" ! The ending has nothing to do with the movie ! its crazy !!!!! As a fan of Segal from the good ol action movie days....this was a big let down. Sorry Steven. Even the title has nothing to do with the movie. 1 star is for the music which was good !"
3,Cry Uncle,"Another sad release from the fallen master.This one suffers from poor cinematographic effects and poor martial arts.After Pistol Whipped I did feel that there was some hope but here we are, only a few short months later, another sub-par performance.I think Steven may be better served with directing and producing movies, with younger actors he could talent scout himself.Please Steven, no more."
2,Somebody Kill Seagal's Career,"This movie is a prime example of quitting long before your time is up.Seagal's Movie KILL SWITCH is damn near impossible to watch for a number of reasons:* Crappy Editing, I don't know whether this was done on purpose or someone had a bad day but this is by far the worse editing job on a Seagal movie that I've seen anyway. Like someone else said the close-up shots of his face during the fight scenes didn't cut mustard with me.* The action sequences were, at best mediocre, his Martial arts skills are a joke in all his 21st century movies, and his gun skills are even worse, firing guns at people that he can't even hit.Anything before 2000 was much better, Under Siege I & II, Out For Justice, On Common Ground, Hard To Kill.....I'd pick any of these over this one any day.Save your money folks, go to Blockbuster and rent it if you Have to but DON'T BUY THIS, it's G-A-R-B-A-G-E!"
1,Not His Best Work,"The DVD and packaging was fine, but the storyline and the acting was not Seagal's best work. There were two story-lines one about a bomber and another about a serial killer, but they were unrelated. Story moved slow and ended weird. First time I noticed that there were a lot of beat 'em up action scenes that really didn't do anything except over-punish the bad guys. (They kept getting up and Seagal would punch them down again.) Also, I noticed that you rarely saw Seagal's face doing the action... like there was a double doing most of his martial arts."
2,One of their weakest...,"The first two tracks are very good and hard-rocking, but then the album takes a nose-dive in quality. Noteworthy for the guest backing vocal of Debbie Harry on 'Go Lil Camaro Go', and Joey's attempt at a ballad ('Bye Bye Baby')."
4,Halfway Decent,"Halfway To Sanity is a big leap from Animal Boy, but not a huge one. It has definently more singable songs like ""I Wanna Live"" and ""Bop Till You Drop"" which slightly verge on self parody again. As the album goes along the songs get better and deeper with ""Garden Of Serentity"" and ""I'm Not Jesus"". I especially liked the song ""Go Lil Camero Go"" with Debbie Harry singing backround vocals because of the way it brings the Ramones back to their Beach Boys fetish. By the time the album is over, I realize that Halfway To Sanity is actually a fair record, mostly because it was the last to feature Richie Ramone on drums."
2,Two great songs.,"Not a very good album, But don't believe everything you hear.I wanna live possibly one of there best songs. Bop til you drop still makes the greatest hits album. In all a pretty good buy."
4,Some of their best songs!,"I got this album when it came out! As with any album by one of my faves, a few songs stuck out. My band immediately started doing ""Death of Me"" and ""Real Cool Time"", and in my opinion they are two of the best Ramones songs ever. Also great is ""I Wanna Live"". The rest ain't bad! It's not thought of as one of their good ones, but I really feel those songs are as good as any! I'd still do Death of Me and Real Cool Time, anytime! Ramones Forever, Forever Ramones!"
5,Ginger Altoids,The product was packaged properly and was received without damage. The product from each individually wrapped container was fresh and a pleasure to consume. I would purchase this item again from Amazon.
1,Pork Gelatin,"Altoids are made with pork gelatin and the packaging does not give any indication of this. Thus altoids are not suitable for vegans, vegetarians, or individuals who eat Halal or Kosher."
5,very hard to find these,intense ginger flavor but tasty seriously I have a minimum of how many words? What really needs to be said about Altoids?..... ...... ..... ... .
5,Ginger Altoids are the BEST!,"I discovered Ginger Altoids 2 years ago at Target stores in Texas. I fell in love with them! They are absolutely the BEST for indigestion. I just enjoy eating them everyday because I love the taste. They are a strong, spicy ginger. When I share one with someone they comment on just how strong they are, but they always want to know where to purchase them. They are addictive! Target stopped carrying them and I e-mailed Altoids. I was afraid they had stopped making them! However, I found them on AMAZON! I'm so happy they sell them, and please don't ever stop!"
5,Altoids Ginger Mints,"They're good for nausea, and they taste good. I've given away some of the packages, since it'll take quite a while to go through all twelve of 'em."
5,Never discontinue,"As a nurse and mother, these are the most fabulous upset ""tummy"" remedies ever....They are fabulous, spicy and clear the senses! Love the Ginger Mints...."
5,Still loving 'em,"I've purchased Ginger Altoids in the past, but they are getting harder to find at normal retail outlets. Good thing Amazon is here. And at a very good price.Great ginger flavour, lots of zest, just like Ginger Altoids!"
5,We Love Altoids!!!,"We love these ginger Altoids! While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our tea and sometimes, coffee. One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting! Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee. And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too. Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative. Almost no calories, but big on flavor! We've used these for decades!"
4,Olympic Winner,My 8 year old daughter had struggled with math since first grade. She loves the practices and challenges of the Olympic games and she especially loves winning the medals. My husband loaded the game and she was able to take it from there with no assistance. She is having fun and learning her math basics. The game is well worth the money.
1,Oh...so... boring,"If your child has not played any educational software games in the past, she or he might be content with this product. However, if your child needs visual stimulation as well as a lot of fun interaction, this game is seriously lacking in both areas. While some of the graphics and sounds are a slight-bit entertaining, they lose their attraction quickly. Math problems can be presented in a far more engaging setting. For example, Scholastic's Math Missions, although not in 3D graphics, is much better; placing math in context of story lines keeps the child engaged for hours."
3,Metrophones review,"The headphones are not great, but not too bad either. Somewhat heavy and the isolation is not as good as described in the reviews I've read before.The really great thing is the metronome built-in. This way i'm able to practice in the evening in the living room without waking up the family.But if you don't need the metronome, go for Senheiser studio headphones. Spec-wise, the isolation is better, and Senheiser are known for excellent sound quality. And they cost less!"
1,This book was horrible,"If there was a zero star the book would definitely get that, the plot was stupid and predictable and the climax was a total of three short paragraphs, save yourself a wasted minute and don't read this tedious, tiresome book"
2,The Mall Madness Disappointment,"I thought that this game would be so much fun when I saw the commercial for it. It's actually not that fun. It's just like any other silly old game. I like The Game of Life way better and Clue and Monopoly and Disney's Charades but not dumb Mall Madness. All you do is move your little marker around to a dumb shop and buy the item. And when you get six, you win. How dumb is that?!?!?!? And also, when you win you're not happy cause you won, you are happy cause the game is FINALLY over! There's no CONGRADULATIONS by the dumb lady who talks in the purple thing! There's no YOU WON by that dumb lady who talks in the purple thing! NOTHING AT ALL! How dumb is that?!?!? Well I give it 2 stars thank you very much... Goodbye that is the end of my REVIEW!!!!"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!,"This toy is so awesome I love it! it doesn't fall apart either. Usually when people say it falls apart they're either not too smart, or don't operate the toy correctly."
3,Mall madness!!!!,"My friend's husband bought her this game a few years ago as a gag gift. We had more fun setting it up & playing it! Even the guys thoroughly enjoyed it, and became very competitive seeking out the bargains. Playing it can be a tad addictive! I'm getting a copy for our family, as our friends moved away recently."
4,Fun & Educational,"This game is a real pain to set up, but is a fun and educational game to play! My 8 year old and 6 year old love it! It's really geared for kids 8 and older...we have to help my 6 yr old a lot because there is money counting and trying to figure out how to move on the mall tiles in order to wind up inside of a store. But my 8 yr old LOVES it, and while it's definately not too hard for her, she IS challenged by the different activities and the concept of the game. Worth the money."
3,it looked like u MUST HAVE on tv but....,"on tv commericials, this game seemed awsome and really fun. i tried getting it but they were all sold out for like forever!!! about a year later, i finally got it and i was kinda disappointed. its fun but its kinda boring like any other board game. and its kinda expensive too. im sorry but if u get it, you'll be disappointed."
4,Kids love it,"My kids love this game - both boys and girls. My daughter (11) takes it to slumber parties and it is always a hit. It has made my daughter more aware of how much ""mall"" shopping is and how to look for sales/bargins. We bought it for Christmas 04, 7 months later it is still a favorite."
4,New Design,"When I was little, I used to play the original version of this with my cousin, in the original game, there were two levels and the gameplay was a little different. I used to LOVE to go over to her house and play. In a way, the new design is a little easier because sometimes the game's second floor would collapse, but this game looks like a bunch of fun!"
5,Great game for mother and daughter.,Great game to enjoy if you have a daughter. Very good way for mother daughter to spend time together and get to know each other better.
3,fun but made poorly,"I got this for my daughter last year (age 9) for Christmas and we both loved playing it and played the whole Christmas break. Its a fun game and easy to learn. The down side is it takes a while to set up, and the big down side is that its made with cheap cardboard and falls apart. We have already thrown the whole thing away which really upset me especially after what I paid last year. Be careful not to spill any drinks on or near and take extreme care of it or it will fall apart.Advice would be to put away right after use and keep away from little ones."
4,A cool game for a rainy day!,"I got this last year and it is pretty fun. It takes some time to set up and you sometimes have to press the ""say it again"" button alot. Mine so far is fun. My mom even says on stormy days ""How about that Mall Madness"" game. It really makes you learn the sentence ""do not spend all the money"" because then you have to go to the ATM.Hope this review helped!"
3,VAIO Review,So far so good - i am playing and learning. the system comes with an over abundance of programs and it takes a while to get all the extra junk off there - i only have 6gb of space until i get everything 'extra' cleared of. Battery life sucks - there is no other way to put it.
1,useless device,"I read the reviews of this device and was excited to purchase. i got the computer from amazon and immediately i was disappointed. the screen is very bright but totally useless and difficult to read. The keyboard is COMPLETELY useless. has absolutely no tactile feel. Forget it if you have big fingers as i do. i have a blackberry for work and i can type a thousand times faster with that. if you are not looking at the key board the entire time you simply dont know if you hit the right keys or not. typing in passwords is incredibly painful because of this issue. Some of the reviewers have said that the computer is reasonably fast. im not really sure what they are used to, but this computer is incredibly slow. Part of that is due to the norton antivirus because it sped up a little when i disabled some of the functions but it didnt fix the problem completely. Im not really sure who can use this thing and what purpose it would serve."
2,Nice performance but Flash Drive too small,"UX390N have a better performance compress old model, but 32GB Flash Drive too small. Sony did not support creating the recover CD, even you use Sony iLink CD/DVD burner. Hate this."
3,Try the OQO Model O2 Instead,"I have tried both and I prefer the OQO Model O2. The OQO has a much better screen, a much better mounting dock, a Wacom Digitized Screen, and it is beautiful. It was designed by the Guy who was Apple's Product Designer for years (he designed the I-Mac). The Sony keyboard is just too small for my fingers."
5,My children are obsessed with this book,"Both of my children are book lovers, but I have never seen them get such delight out of a book as they do with Scranimals. My daughter is 9 and my son is 4.5. They read it over and over and we have constant conversations about which scranimal is our favorite (in the car, at the dinner table, in bed). I take such pleasure in reading this book - the cadence, the rhyming, and the beautiful pictures. This is my new ""birthday present of choice"". Every child's party we attend in '05 will be with Scranimals wrapped to give. It is not only their favorite, but mine as well."
5,"One of the greatest ""alternative"" albums of all time","This is Jane Sibery's best album. The songs are longer and more complex than on her other CD's. They run in the 5 to 12 minute range. The songs represent the best of the ""alternative"" rock movement. They take the new wave/punk sound and mix it with a psychodelic sound. This and Sinead O'Connor's ""The Lion and the Cobra"" are along the same lines, except O'Connor's CD is more flashy while Sibery's CD is more laid back. These two represented the real potential of alternative music.Sibery's earlier CD's were more folksy. Her later CD's followed this same style, but weren't as complex. Then she started experimenting with all kinds of styles, including country."
3,Avia II DVD,"The DVD was beneficial and my Panasonic Plasma is setup perfectly. Color, tint and temperature. There are a lot of video test screens that really aren't beneficial to the average user....great if you have all the test equipment.The audio portion was excellent for setting up and balancing my 5.1 surround system. Easy to follow and nice to have if you are serious about your home theater."
2,Disappointing,"The the disc holder was broke, the case fell apart in moments and the color filters were small, cheap and lying loose in the case. I've never seen a DVD case fall apart on it's own before. The DVD content tries to go in depth but is really only good for the 6 basic image setups and basic surround sound checks. Not worth the $40. I'm going to return it and buy the ""Sound&Vision Home Theater Tune-Up"" that has better reviews and is half the cost."
1,Save your money on this one,This video really only helps with a couple of things such as brightness. It wasn't that far off from the factory settings on my plasma tv. Don't bother with this video unless you need a $30 coaster.
2,save your money,"might not be completely useless, but it's close enough. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, because I did wait long enough after buying my TV to have tweaked the settings to my satisfaction without this disc. The biggest reason I got it was to check the color accuracy, and I find their method of doing so extremely flawed. In fact, I found it useless.You're looking through colored gels at a color test pattern with blinking squares in the center, and you really can't tell what the heck you're adjusting, or if it's getting better or worse or what. Just play a bunch of DVDs and watch a lot of broadcast channels and tweak until you get the skin tones right on most of them, it'll be better than this."
4,Good Overall Audio and Video setup,"The Avia II is a great introduction and easy to understand starting guide for someone not familiar with HT (Home Theater) systems and how to connect AVR (Audio Video Receiver), previously idenified as a stereo receiver. And for those true audiophiles it is a good review :)There are sound tones to make sure your speakers are connected correctly and to set the levels. In addition for audio setting, I would recommend buying a SPL( Sound Pressure Level) meter which measures the loudness of sound in decibels (dBs). Radio Shack makes a very good SPL meter fro $50.The SPL is more precise than auto-setup because you can very easily adjust teh sound level of every speaker to be exactly equal at the postion listening position or at 1 meter from each speaker.The video setup is excellent and easy to use for calibrating just about any TV. You do not need any special tools. You need the TV remote and access to the TV setup menu.Overall, a very good product."
1,Outdated Product,"This is not a great product - it is not compatible with the latest DVD/BlueRay players for much of the test tone sound track - many of the options do not function (Example the on-screen menu displays a pause point to test left speaker - I assume a tone is supposed to be produced, but no tone is produced - and the same applies to the other channels). It is way better to purchase a Sound Level Meter from RadioShack and use the tones generated in your receiver for speaker setup (if your AV receiver has this feature). The one useful thing is the setting of color tone/hue/contrast/balance on my flat panel LCD wide screen."
5,Great little tool,"This DVD was extremely well made, and it helped squeeze the extra performance out of my TV. It also taught me a bit about Home Theater and how everything fits together. Totally worth the money - It really does make a huge difference. I look at TVs that have not been calibrated with a tool like this and I can see the lack of detail an realism in the image. Highly recommended."
5,Perfect for Set Up,I'll keep it short and sweet. It is a necessary tool to calibrate any television (especially w/ HD) and receiver w/ digital sound. The color films are a great help as well. Excellent update. I highly recommend it.
4,"Real trance, not airheaded disco...","Some folks have commented that this is a lousy excuse for techno/disco. Thank goodness ""Trance 1"" ain't that garbage, but it is an excellent compilation of REAL trance music, that doesn't rely on disco beats to send one into a 'no mind state'. So this is anything but utter noise, but a collection of fascinating sounds that's wonderful to hear, if you can stand to listen to something without a beat."
1,Ingratiangly bad...,"If anyone has ever listened to real techno music, they will certainly recognize this for what it is: pure, utter, noise. Give me BT anyday :)"
3,"It's an OK coffee maker, but buttons stick","I have NOT had the same problem mentioned by others with coffee grounds getting into the pot, but yes I've experienced the dribble onto the counter while pouring coffee into the cup. I've had this coffee maker for a few years now, and my biggest complaint is that the on/off buttons are frozen. I have to really, really push on them to activate.The off button is not too much of a consequence, since the pot automatically shuts itself off after two hours - a feature that I really like (no more worrying if you forgot to turn off the coffee pot after leaving the house). The set delay, hour, and minute buttons are frozen, too. I like the black color - it hides the coffee discoloration that the white units seem to get."
1,Don't buy - unless you like coffee grinds in your coffee,"We have had this coffee maker for over a year and why I don't just throw it away is beyond me. We always make 12 cups of coffee and we constantly get grinds in our coffee. Not just a few, our coffee is gritty. We have to filter the pot to get the grounds out. It leaks water from the back. Even if you add enough water for 12 cups you only get 10. Not to mention when you pour the coffee it flows down the pot onto the counter, rather than in the cup, regardless if you pour fast or slow. To sum it up, don't waste your money!!"
2,"Drip, drip, drip","It is impossible to pour a cup of coffee without the basket dripping on the hot plate and the coffee dripping from the carafe as you pour. Don't try to pour at the table, pour next to the coffee maker with sponge and paper towel handy.It does brew a nice cup of coffee and keep it hot.Another problem is that the programmable and on/off buttons protrude from the front of the curved base. I thought at first the clock didn't work. What happens is it is very easy to accidental touch these buttons with anything near the coffee maker and throw off your settings."
3,Not bad for price,"This maker does a good job brewing the coffee. It is easy to use and make s a HOT cup of coffee. However, you would think after all these years of designing coffee pots, Mr. Coffee would have the best design. Nope, not even close.No matter how slow I go or hard I try, the coffee pot ALWAYS ""dribbles"". To put it simply, it is a very bad design. If you pour a cup of coffee, do it on a napkin."
4,compares favorably with higher end coffee makers,"I was getting fed up with$100 coffee makers which didn't keep the coffee hot, or dripped when poured, so i decided to try this one, and got it on sale at an incredible price, under $20!!!!! it is attractive, easy to use, makes a nice hot brew and is quick and quiet. the only negative is that you have to use MORE coffee grinds. for some reason, perhaps the lack of a cone shaped basket, the coffee was weak using the normal amount of coffee. so i add an extra scoop for 6 cups, and an extra 2 scoops for 12 cups. not a big deal and the coffee is great. save your money for good quality coffee, and enjoy this lovely cofffeemaker. i have stopped being a coffee maker snob! and this is after years of having problems with the top of the line products!!!!"
1,Hate this coffeemaker,"I've had this coffeemaker for two weeks. I bought it because I had an old Mr. Coffee that worked fine, but was white and stained. I liked that this was black and looked sleek. The very second time I used it, the off button stuck, so you can no longer turn off the machine, but have to wait for it to turn itself off. Also, EVERY pot has grounds in it. I'm using the filters that came with it, and have never even filled it to capacity, and I can't figure out why there are ALWAYS grounds in my coffee. Piece of junk. Don't buy it!"
1,don't buy this model,"Poor carafe design makes this Mr. Coffee machine a waste of money. We bought this model to replace our old Mr. Coffe machine after we broke the carafe and couldn't purchase a replacement for that model. We loved our old Mr. Coffee, but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because, as other reviewers have noted, it's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee/water everywere. After the first few uses, we decided to purchase a different coffee maker."
2,broke after 6 months,"It wasn't very convenient that the warranty had just expired. Don't bother. Get anything but a Mr. Coffee coffee pot, please!"
1,Mr. Coffee units die early,I had a Mr. Coffee machine that I bought early in 2010. The water heating element stopped working by November. My mother got her Mr. Coffee in October and the heater went kaput just after Christmas. Maybe we both just happened to get that one-in-a-million lemon. Or maybe Mr. Coffee is putting out more than their share of defects.
1,Don't throw away your receipt,"I got this coffee maker to replace a Proctor Silex that had lasted for well over a decade.It stopped working within the first month - just up and quit! Unfortunately, I was expecting it to last at least through the 90 day warantee and by that time had discarded the packing and lost my receipt so I was out $35 for this useless piece of trash.In it's short life it made OK coffee, but the carafe dripped something awful!"
1,Goodbye Mr. Coffee,"After using nothing but Mr. Coffee products to make coffee with for nearly 25 years, we are never going to buy one again. This model, like the model before it, has a bad burner plate that quickly loses it's teflon-like coating no matter how careful you are with sliding the pot in and out of the slot. When that happens, it not only looks ugly, but affects the overall heating performance of the coffee maker. I also agree with many other users that the design must have been created during a contest between mechanical monkeys and amateur apes. An awkward lid, dripping pot, and ridiculous top spout that needs pushing out of the way every time you replace the filter, all combine to make this the worst coffee maker I've ever used. If the Mr. Coffee company cared at all about their customers they would issue a recall on this product. But then, if they really cared about the consumer, this piece of trash would have never left the factory. Goodbye Mr. Coffee, forever!"
1,Coffee Maker failed after 7 months,The coffee maker did a good job for 7 months and then the heating elements failed. I would not buy this model again.
1,Buy plenty of paper towels first,I hate this coffe maker. I actually hate it.It is impossible to pour the water in the machine or coffee into your cup without spilling everywhere.I thought about just donating it to charity but then I thought what a horrible thing to do to the poor.So now I am going to take it out to the woods and give it both barrels of my shotgun.Do not buy this coffee maker. YOU WILL REGRET IT!
1,Mr. Coffee can take a leap with this POS coffeemaker.,"This is my very first review. I am just so pissed about this coffee maker that I had to write. Mr. Coffee has been making coffee makers for over 30 YEARS now. Suddenly, they don't know how to make one. Do they think I'm going to buy another one of their products??? No way, now how. I'm going to find myself a good ol' percolator, and they can stick their piece of garbage coffee makers where the sun don't shine."
1,YOU WON'T GET HOT COFFEE WITH THIS PIECE OF [....],"I purchased this coffee maker and in three months time, threw it out. What a piece of [....]. You can NEVER get a decent HOT cup of coffee (it is lukewarm at best) and the carafe not only breaks, so you have to replace it, but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup. What a dissapointment this machine is. Mr. Coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee, but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone. The only nice thing I can say about it is the programmable timer worked. I would not give this coffee maker one star, but that was the lowest rating available. If it were up to me, I would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating!"
3,meah,"It's about what I expected for the price, shipped on time. More of a rock piece than say jazz. boomboommachine"
5,Welcome Back!,It's about time Johnny came back to his roots! This is an excellent release that just took took took took long... but worth the wait.
5,Johnny is fantastic!!,"Johnny Clegg's latest album is wonderful as so many of his albums are.His music is some of the most uplifting music I have ever listened to.If you ever have a chance to see him in concert, you wouldn't be dissappointed!"
1,garbage,Pure and simple garbage and waste of money! every aspect is an insult to our intelligence. and all those responsible for the release of this bomb should be arrested for legalized thievery!
5,Interesting and Insightful,"Hand of Providence is an enjoyable read, with a comprehensive look at the many events in President Reagan's life which shaped his faith, and how his faith affected both his personal and professional life."
4,"Great Idea, but mistakes","As a descendant of Conversos, and researcher of their history, I am REALLY glad to see a young adult book of this kind. However, I was very unhappy to see mistakes. They are minor, and I hope that a second edition will be better edited. For example, the mother, at one point, says, ""Uno momento."" This is horrible Spanish and only non-speakers would say this. The correct way is, ""UN momento."" Still, I'm glad that the subject is being written by and for non-scholars. Isabel/Ruth's experiences are true to the time she lived in, and this period in history is widely ignored by many. Secret Jews (Anusim) and their descendants deserve more attention!"
5,Nightshade by Nora Roberts,We received this book in time in Great condition. This title will make a great addition to our Nora Roberts collection for our library. Thank you so much.
1,Cliche,"I couldn't stand to watch this movie, the only reason i continued to watch this whole thing was because i was with a friend and we couldn't stop the movie.It was poorly actedThe dialogue was pointless and confusingThe characters were 2dimensional and boringThe plot was obvious, there were no laughs to be had in this movie unless you are a fan of lowbrow comedy.If you want to enjoy some art that will have you laughing hard and has to do with college antics, try reading any of Tucker Max's books, or Darren Bryce's books."
5,Fun and Light-Hearted,"The Camden sisters go on adventures of their own in this 3-story book. Ruthie goes to Hollywood, The Best Oktoberfest, and Sisters Through the Seasons are all enjoyable and is a good extension of the Camden family saga, that has become a hit long-running television show. Other recommended books: Wedding Memories (7th Heaven) and the Gilmore Girls series."
3,"Incredibly interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying",She takes the tried and true seelie myth and weaves an interesting tale. The real problem with this book is the length. It takes too long and moves too slowly. By 1/3 of the book you know the bad guy and you know the ending.
4,Not a bad way to start a writing career!,"Seal Island by Kate Braillier is a great debut novel. Without going into the details of the novel (see previous reviews), Ms. Braillier does a stellar job with her characters, the mystery and the setting, and the haunting legend of the selkie. It made me yearn for the maine coastline. and i love a first person story when its done well. The author accomplished that. I was surprised by the numerous typos in the book, however. I also felt the book was a tad too long, resulting in a bit of a sagging middle. These are nits, because for a first book, Seal Island is exceptional."
2,Seal Island,"I ordered this book from this place on Amazon and it said the condition was very good. When I got it, part of the cover was torn and part of the spine was broke. Very miss leading on the condition for this book. But other books I have gotten from Amazon have been great."
5,My Baby Loves Them,"A great non-wheat option for babies younger than one year. Very crumbly, so they are not a choking hazard. Wish we'd found them earlier, as they keep our daughter entertained and happy while we enjoy our dinner."
4,"4 Stars, though ""Christian Identity"" is false teaching","Though Ted Weiland is a Christian Identity/British Israelite proponent (and/or charlatan), I couldn't find anything in his pamphlet that I disagreed with -- in fact, I wish Christian teachers (REAL Christian teachers) would do the same research he has. Weiland's conclusions are pretty much the same as Chuck Baldwin's conclusions in ""Romans 13 Revisited"" (and Baldwin is not part of the Christian Identity movement), and I agree with both men and with the idea that Christians have a moral obligation to resist (by force of arms, if necessary) the tyranny of unjust governments. So kudos to Weiland (just this once) for proving the principle that in theology, you can't throw out the baby with the bathwater."
5,Tasteful.,I have several John Tesh Christmas albums but this one is my favourite. I particularly like the arrangements on this album. Smooth as satin. The only tune I didn't know was Carol of the Birds'. The rest of them we all know and love.
2,The computer version is a LOT better!,"I have the computer versions of this game and enjoyed them a lot more. This game would've been more fun if the controls weren't so bad. Maybe its just me, but I had the hardest time seating people at the tables. You have to touch and drag them to a table and then release and they should sit down but instead, they would just jump back in line. This happened over and over again until by chance it might work. And also when I would touch a table to clean up, it would instead go to the table next to it. I dont know if its just mine but Im curious to hear what other players are experiencing. I found Cake Mania for DS ten times better than this one."
3,Like Online...kinda,"Agree with other reviewers, this game does not translate well to the small screen of the DS. Also the top screen was virtually not used. It could have been to show customers waiting in line. Though the most frustrating part is if you don't tap exactly where you should, the action doesn't take. On the good side, I can play it when ever I want now, and not just when I am at my Computer!Overall, just as entertaining as the computer game and just as addicting!"
5,Diner Dash is a blast!,I couldn't put down the game! Each level takes a little more skill to meet your goals. FUN! FUN! FUN!
4,just like the online game,I loved playing this game online and the DS verison stays true to it plus new customers! If you like the online games you'll enjoy this verison a lot.
4,"fun, kind-of hard","well, it is really fun, but having to take time to change the screens, makes it almost impossible to even pass on the pc., so even though it is fun, i will give you that, but i would probably stick to the pc version.the graphics look kind of wierd, the tables are really squished together, fun(portable), and except for a couple levels, pretty easy to pass and get expert first.but if you are ust now trying diner dash, i would recomend you trying the pc version first! ¡éÀ"
3,Diner Dash,"I bought this for my daughter and she enjoyed it, though once she got mario brothers, she hasn't played it any more"
5,Diner Dash,It's a excellent game. My friends that come over liked the game and now I'm getting it as a birthday gift for her.
4,Fun kinda short,"I played maybe once a day for possibly an hour if that, and by day 3 i was on the last level.I still loved it it was blast"
4,Good Game... Just Quick,"First, I should say that I am a 30 year old female. I did enjoy playing this game. It was just too quick! Before I knew it, I had already beaten the game. It was fun while it lasted though. I did not play this game all day, every day. Just wish it had lasted a little longer! This game lasted me only a couple weeks."
4,Great port of Diner Dash games,The game translates well on the DS. At least for me - it was easier to play the game with the stylus than using a mouse or trackpad on a PC/Mac.Graphics is not that great though - but that is typical of Diner Dash games. I can't complain about the gameplay.
5,A very good gun.,This gun worked very good 30 square and no jams. I know that is not a lot of shingles but that is not bad.It also worked like a dream loading and is very easy to handle.I don't know how it willhold up but it is built very well. I would recomend this gun to anybody.
1,Poor Performance,"Maybe I just got a bad gun, but it consistantly drived the nails too deep, crooked, and fails to feed tbe next nail. I need to renail at least 2 nails per bundle! Pressure is fine and I have an oiler on the gun and yes, it is filled with oil. I bought it because of the brand reputation, warranty, and fully opening chamber to get good acces to jammed nails."
2,NOT a cold weather gun!,"DO NOT BUY THE NEW BOSTICH! I have sworn by bostich coil roofing nailers for years, but no more. I have used these guns for over 20 years. My old guns are still awesome but I purchased 2 new guns last year. When it is cool in the morning (not freezing) these guns do NOT fire. I can put them in the truck under the heater and they will start working, but you cant stay under the heater. A lot of other roofers are reporting the same issue. Kind of ironic that guns I have had for 10 years or more work fine but the new ones don't."
3,"The patch you need for ""Reading Greek""","""Reading Greek"" was first published in two volumes: the TEXT and the GRAMMAR, VOCABULARY AND EXERCISES. ""An Independent Study Guide to Reading Greek"" was subsequently published to patch up the shortcomings of the original volumes (which could not be easily reprinted with corrections because they are so interrelated). The authors - a committee - admit that even teachers of Greek found the original volumes quite difficult to follow. The original explanations are too brief; reference material is scattered throughout the text; and the typography is poor (with some very small Greek fonts, and badly organized headings and subheadings).If your school or university has prescribed ""Reading Greek"" - you wouldn't buy it otherwise - you are, unfortunately, part of a captive market and you really need to buy ""An Independent Study Guide to Reading Greek"" as well to make sense of the course."
4,A GREAT BOOK,"Zig Ziglar has done it again, this book is a book which will give anyone who reads it, an extra lift in order to obtain any goal you set yourself. Remember you are not stuck where you are, you have the ability for great things, and like zig always says, you can have everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want. Buy this book, its a great read, i cant wait for the audio programe, so i can hear zig read it in that texan voice of his"
5,What a wonderful book that encourages you every day!,"Who needs encouragement? The answer is ""Everyone who has breath needs encouragement."" It means everybody around you including yourself.I found this heart warming stories of people with integrity, faith, love,and kindness encouraging me every day. Whenever I read this book, I almost can hear Zig talking to me in his Texan accent. It may appear as just a little book, but through this little book, you will gain a direct access to Zig's life long philosophy, passion, wisdom and encouragement.Read the book and be the person who encourage others around you!"
4,A great book,"This is a good book to read at the begining of any day, it enables you to open the book at any page, cause it has various storys which will give you a lift, to pursue your goals. I recommend it"
5,Did the job,They came relatively quickly and did the job. I have no complaints. I will likely order these again in the future.
3,The organization was not what I expected. I was looking for detailed descriptions of the various commands.,"I was seeking details about each of the QBASIC commands. Instead the book went into great detail with arcane examples, most of which did NOT relate to the programs that I have designed. For example; there was not much about the differences between LPRINT and WRITE USING.commands. LPRINT assumes that my printer (and computer) has a parallel port. Neither is my case.If there are any other manuals available please let me know.RegardsRichard"
4,Fun to read with a lot of examples.,"This book has MANY examples! It has examples on how to write a line of code and has programs that you type in if you wish, but they have a disk offer on the back. The book is missing a few things like how to make music on a program but it's O.K.. I highly recommend it."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"This book was not what I was looking for. I am a beginner with no background in computer programming. I did the exercises and read and reread everything in the first 5 chapters of this book and I just wasn't able to grasp the concept of what I was trying to do. I was doing all the programs, but I didn't quite understand the basic elements of QBASIC. For me the book need to start on a more fundmental level. Once I get the fundmentals I plan on going back to ""QBASIC for Dummies"" and finish the book."
4,Very cool,Great toy but bigger than I thought it would be. I must say it is indestructible. I have a beagle and he loves it.
3,Not Quite Our Dog's Cup of Tea,"We have a lab/shepard mix and he loves his bigger Jolly Ball for outside play. I ordered the Jolly Critter so he could have something to play with inside during the colder days of winter. I'm not sure if its the bright orange color or the vanilla scent but he doesn't seem to like it as much as the ball.It's a very sturdy toy and its bigger than a tennis ball so that was great. It just doesn't seem like its our dog's cup of tea. I'll keep trying and maybe he will play with it later.If you have a dog that chews alot and likes to play inside, I would recommend this because it is made so well."
3,Did not stand up to JRT chewing,"My JRT was able to easily chew off bits and pieces of this toy (tail ""handle"") so it didn't last long. It is heavy and hard to squeak, but she was able to squeak it and enjoyed it, but not for long. Once she set to chewing and got pieces of plastic off, I had to remove the toy. Probably better suited to a dog that fetches rather than destroys."
2,Lasted ten minutes,"My dachshund had the nose off this 4.5"" jolly pet in under ten minutes. She really liked it, but had quickly chewed small pieces of plastic off so I threw it away before she could eat them.This toy had no scent as far as I could tell.I won't buy it again, I don't feel it is safe for my dog."
3,not very Scented,"My dog loves to play with this and it it tough and squeeky, but did not have any smell other than that chemical rubber smell."
2,Not right for my dogs...,"I was optimistic after reading the other reviews, but wish I had not ordered this toy. My 3 labs LOVE to chew, and this squirrelJolly Pet 4.5"" Vanilla Scented Jolly Critter Squirrel Orangedid not last more than an hour with them. It was wonderful for fetch and for them to play keep away and tug together, but the moment one of them settled in, pieces started coming off. Every dog is different, so maybe it will work for yours."
4,Kuma!,"The product was exactly as the picture shows but it had a small rip down it's back and it needed to be fixed pretty much straight out of the box, other then that excellent."
4,My son LOVES this vacuum!!!,"My son is 19 months old and absolutely loves this vacuum. Everytime he heard the vacuum in my house, he would run to it... He wants to help. :) I decided to get him one and I was goingto get the Dyson looking vacuum because it looks like ours, but the reviews swayed me. I ultimately picked this dirt devil. Yes, it is small... It is the perfect size for my son... He is almost 36"" tall. He is so cute with the vacuum... It has a light and makes sound as well... He insists on taking it with him everywhere. This vacuum has now been to the park, the beach and taken many elevator rides. It has vacuumed lawns, sidewalks etc.I have purchased a ridiculous amount of ""stuff"" for my son... toys, books, games etc. and so far... this vacuum is his favorite!!"
5,My little helper,My 2 year old son LOVES this vacuum - he got it last Christmas and it went to bed with him for the first couple weeks thereafter. He MUST have his vacuum whenever I vacuum. The only thing is the hose keeps popping off and is very frustrating for my son. Otherwise for the price you can't expect more. I was thinking of buying another one so I could have one for upstairs and the other for downstairs. It does pick up some lint - check the small cloth bag behind the front cover periodically - you will be surprised at how much it picks up!
3,GOTTA BE A MISPRINT!!!!,"If you are looking at this toy, STOP and do NOT buy it for this price! Almost 60 bucks has GOT to be a misprint!!! I got this toy vacuum for around 10 bucks, and that's about what it's worth. Cute, serves it's play purpose well, but no WAY it should be priced anything over $15 at the MOST! Shop around before you buy it here!!!!"
1,false advertising,"This toy sucks. I still have to vacuum. If only dyson would make a lightweight real vacuum, then I could put my feet up, drink a manhattan, and let my daughter do all the work."
1,"Good idea, poor design","I gave this to my daughter(4) last year for Christmas so she could ""help"" me around the house, and all it does is frustrate her b/c the hose came off, and this WILL NOT roll on even very,very low-pile carpet. The wheels should have been made larger. It will roll on a hard floor, though."
1,Not made very well I would not Buy This Again for over $20.00,Made very cheap I will not buy this item again for more then $20.00I would have sent it back but I didn't have any other present to give himon his Birthday
1,Don't bother,We bought this for our 27 month old who is obsessed with vacuum cleaners. The lights/sound function didn't work even with new batteries. It doesn't roll easily on carpet and it doesn't stand upright alone. What a waste. I didn't buy mine from Amazon but I don't think it matters where you buy it from. Don't waste your money!
3,fun toy but poor quality,My toddler LOVES this toy. He pushes it around and plays with it all the time. It has a little button that you push and that makes a vacuum noise and turns on a little light. It doesn't actually pick up anything though. But it's very very poor quality. You can tell as soon as you pick it up b/c it feels like its going to break in your hands.
3,Dirt Devil Toy Vacuum,"My grandson loves it, but for the price it was...I might consider a different one. I thought this one would be much better than one of the kiddie ones because it is a ""dirt devil"" so all in all he loves it and I am glad but not worth the price on my end."
4,Dirt Devil Scoop,Not as well made as the one 10 yrs ago . It is sure fun to watch a 12 month old push it around the house. Problem is the 5 yr. old loves it too. Little pricy but kids love it.
1,Disappointed,"Well, had I taken the time to read the other reviews before I bought this toy, I wouldn't have purchased it. I liked the realistic look of this vacuum compared with others I'd seen, but my daughter gave up on it within minutes because, as other people have commented, it won't roll on the carpet. The wheels are really poorly designed and the whole toy is very cheaply made. I am returning it."
4,Very goood vacuum for the price,Very durable vacuum and it is also inexpensive compared to the other toy vacuums models. My 2.5 year old daugher absolutely loves it and I would recommend it to everyone who is looking to buy a toy vacuum.
3,Dissapointed.Not 31 inches in height as described.,I purchased this toy for my 4 1/2 year old trusting all the positive reviews as well as the manifacturer's/seller's age reccomendation and size describtion.First off this vacuum is not as described.It is a lot smaller.I believe on the box it indicated that it is 26 1/2 inches not 31.This is a toy more suitable for 3-4 year old child.My daughter is not tall but this vacuum was almost too small for her.I was greatly dissapointed especially since I bought and returned the same vacuum (different color and brand-Just Like Home)from Walmart for $20.00 the day before I ordered this one hoping it is the bigger better quality version. This toy is definately not worth $50.00 and I would not reccomend it to any of my friends.
4,Great little vacuum,"My daughter is almost 4 and she loves this little vacuum. She like to ""help out"" and now she feels like she can.Pros:1. Actually picks up a bit of dust2. Lights up3. Realistic sound4. Durable so far5. Just the right size6. Fairly easy to operate (I think a just-turned-3-year-old might have trouble with it but by almsot 4 they can learn with a little practice.)Cons:1. It would be nice for the little dust trap to have a hinged opening so it's easier to get the lint out. (My daughter loves getting to empty it but since the opening is just a little hole about the size of a nickel it's difficult.)2. My daughter was dissapointed that the hose that stretches over the back doesn't come off so that she can vacuum the tops of things like mommy. It really bothered her at first.)These are the only reasons that I didn't give it a 5 star rating.Overall we are very pleased with this little vacuum."
3,Overpriced,"I could have bought a real Dirt Devil for the price I paid for this TOY!!! The motor hardly runs and I put new batteries in it. The little beads don't even swirl around. Also, It came in the wrong box with no paperwork. I think I got ripped off. However, the grandchild likes it. Soooooo!"
3,"This toy sorta sucks, pun intended","First off the vacuum is not very durable, seems pretty cheaply made for a toy that costs over $40. It says it actually has suction and I never suspected it would be very much but it has so little they might as well not done it at all, I was not sure it was even working at first. The sounds it makes and not very close to what a real vacuum sounds like just kinda a strange noise. I would probably give this thing one star except for the fact my nephew did not seem to totally hate it and did push it around for awhile. Luckily they have hard wood floors at their house because I tried to push this thing on a rug and it would not even move, doesn't seem very well thought out and I suspect most people will be disappointed in it."
2,Not what I was expecting!,"I really wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing... that mistake was all my own! My 23 month old has an obsession with vacuums so I wanted to get him something to play with so I don't have to drag out vacuum out several times a day to avoid a temper tantrum. I was browsing on my phone, saw the picture and thought it looked cool, and purchased it. I was seriously dissapointed when it arrived! It is *super* light and not realistic at all. It also makes that annoying fake ""clicking"" sound as it rolls across the carpet. It does have a light and sound which is great, but you can't even hear it over the clicking sound. It is not worth $30 AT ALL... I'm going to spend the extra $20 and get a more realistic looking one. Too bad my husband threw away the packaging already or this would be sent back!"
2,FLIMSY!,"We had the other Dirt Devil toy vacuum and were looking to replace it when it finally wore out from too much use. When I ordered this I thought it was the same one but this one is really flimsy. My son wouldn't even use it! I had to go onto eBay and buy another Dirt Devil like his old one, which has that plexi part in front where the beads bounce around. Now THAT is a great vacuum...it even sounds like a real vacuum! I wouldn't suggest this one...it sure didn't pass the kid-test in MY house."
5,Fun Toy - - Poor Quality,"My 4 year old recieved this for her birthday... Within minutes, the hose detached and cannot be retached except with duct tape holding it together. My 2 year-old son is very frustrated by the this. My children have enjoyed playing with it though. Also, the one I have also picks up dirt and is supposed to place it in the removeable canister. Since the hose is broken it dirt gets clogged. My 4 year-old understands that it is not supposed to do that and gets upset."
3,WHY ARE THEY OVERCHARGING?,This toy's price is listed as $24.99 at the both the company's webiste and toy'r'us. Why is Amazon charging so much more???....
1,Not durable!!,My son is 18 months and really loved this as a christmas present. He never put it down but I would never buy it again. It is not durable at all. It only lasted 3 days and it broke when he was vacuuming and it should not break that easily.
2,Not what I expected,"My son loves the vacuum, and my sitter has a toy one that he adores. I found this one on line and ordered it right away. Much to my disappointment, it was not like the one she had. I guess for a toy under ten dollars, I shouldn't expect very much. My son is very advanced for one year, and he became bored fairly quickly. There is a small button on the bottom part of the toy that turns on the ""motor"", however, it is not large and is the same color as the rest of the toy, making it difficult for little eyes to detect. The whirring sound only lasts a few moments and then shuts off. It also locks when placed upright, and is difficult for small children to release. The other thing that I noticed is that the plastic handle has rough edges, and within minutes of playing, my son had scratches on his arms and chest. I would not recommend this toy for anyone under the age of 5. If your child likes to help clean, spend the extra money to get a better brand."
3,**ITS CHEAPER ELSEWHERE**,"I bought this for my son when he was 2 in Walmart for $15. Its a great, very realistic play toy, my son had lots of fun with it. It was a great buy at $15 but the $60 you would have to shell out for it here is just NOT WORTH IT. Shop around in your local stores - you'll get it cheaper."
2,not worth the money,I ordered this for my 3 year old. In my opinion this toy is not worth the twelve dollars. It is worth more like five dollars. My daughter was disappointed with this toy and grew frustrated with it in minutes. And the vaccuming noise sounds awful. I would recommend spending more money and getting a better version.
5,Love It!,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was about 18 months old. He absolutely loves it. He vacuums inside, outside and in the car. He pushes the vacuum around the neighborhood to the playground. Whenever I start vacuuming, he immediately runs to his vacuum and helps. The cost of this toy is extremely cheap, especially considering the hours of fun play my son has derived from it. I highly recommend this toy for toddlers. The battery compartment does not always hold the batteries in tightly enough for the sound and lights function to work, but he is not very interested in that function anyway. Happy vacuuming!"
2,fun for some time,this toy shows a good impression on kids firstly but later on they realise its not real and not give much importance to it.also it is expensive compared to its use and value
3,"Here's the ""Dirt"" on the Dirt Devil!!","This is the second Dirt Devil we have purchased and the toy is GREAT fun for a 2 year old who likes to pretend to be helping out at home. Unfortunately the first one broke fairly soon after it was given, and because it was such a fun toy,we bought a second one as a birthday gift. The second one we bought, broke as soon as it was played with (the on-off button). We may have just had bad luck, but wish it were a more durable toy."
2,Fairly disappointing,"I bought this item because it had a brand name on it and it looked more like a real vacuum than other items. But just because it says Dirt Devil doesn't mean it has 1/2 the quality of a real Dirt Devil. This broke after 2 months of basic toddler play. The part that says ""dirt devil"" popped off, exposing things toddlers should not touch. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.Instead I would recommend spending a little more money for a better product."
4,"Fun, Pretty Realistic, but Not that Durable","My son has had this toy for about one year. He LOVES it! At the beginning, it actually did pick up some stuff, but after a month or two, that function weakened. The cover doesn't stay on very well, but he does love the toy and it continues to be fun for him. I am replacing it with the Dyson model."
2,Not just the title is wounded in this movie...,"Sad to say, but this is far from as good a movie that the other reviews give the impression it is. Basically the story revolves around Julie, a female federal agent, who was part of a team tracking a bear poacher. They get wiped out, and only Julie survives because a biological quirk. The bulk of the movie deals with her psycological recovery, and slow build up to the final confrontation between Julie and the poacher. Unfortunately, the movie is almost devoid of suspense--it's just to predictable: especially the ending--and is marred by a poor screenplay. Only Graham Greene saves the movie from being a total disaster, but due to circumstances way beyond his control, even his performance isn't all that great. You'd have to be insane to buy this movie new at $65."
2,Doesn't Point Down,"I sleep with a fan on everynight, and when my previous fan finally died I went store to store looking for a replacement. I needed a fan that would point down instead of up, which have apparently become very rare since no stores in my area had any with that function. I was very excited to find this fan online and based on the description it was suppose to point down. Unfortunately, it DID NOT. I tried placing items underneath it to make it point down, but the noise the other reviewer reported (which I did experience as well) got worse. I eventually returned the fan and bought a wall mounted fan that points down instead."
1,Not Good,"An amalgam of metaphors, allegories, similes and bupkiss. It could well be art! But it certainly lacks a coherent plot or meaningful dialogue. The viewer's misery is further enhanced by an Estonian countryside that is uniformly dreary, drab, rainy and mud-ridden. On the other hand, if you enjoy bedlam, gluttony, long silences, cannibalism, dismemberment and simulations of animal cruelty this just might be your cup of tea."
4,Better than windshield mounts,"I have an Iway 500C GPS that I move between our two cars. Because the 500C is so heavy, that was not an easy task when I had to take the mount off the windshield and remount it (with the 500C on it so I could position it correctly). Then several times the mount broke loose and the 500C tumbled to the floor. This mount is much more convenient in that you can just plop it on the dash and reposition as desired. It is easy to pick up to move to another car. Unfortunately, on rough roads it does slide around the dash some, requiring occasional repositioning. Part of the problem may be that the mounting ball is directly in the center so the GPS itself is off center. I would prefer a bracket that was off center so the mounted GPS would be centered. Still, I much prefer it to the windshield mount. Of note is that the photo of this item does not show the 3-lobed base that it is attached to."
1,Paslode F350S,"As the owner of a professional custom wood crating shop, we fire 1000's of nail monthly. This is by far the worst product we have ever used. It came miss firing and not firing from day one. Our supplier thought we were crazy, but upon checking w/ the factory it was discovered to have a Paslode known problem. (The old nieve corporate mentality - getting the customers $$ and worry about it later)It was updated and repaired several times, but continues to not fire and blow air either from the head or trigger (apparently from poor fitting internals). We can not deal with this piece of junk. It's headed to the dump....."
4,Framing Contractor - Grand Rapids Michigan,"...It seems that all the experienced framers in the area prefer the Hitachi nailer. I disagree. I prefer the Paslode. The balance, and weight make a big difference to me. I also prefer the nails. You do not have to concern yourself with the plastic flying into your face. Some will say the Hitachi is a faster gun, however I am unable to find anybody who is able to run either gun to its full potential. The only reason I gave it a four star is because of the clipped head nails. If I can find a round head nail that will work with this gun, it would become a 5 star review for sure..."
3,not too bad,"in my opinion this nail gun is not the worst on the market does an average job of driving nails. be sure to watch the depth adjustment on the end. The depth adjustment has a tendency to work loose, and over time the tightening screw will break off."
5,Paslode nailer,"Product was as advertised, arrived in perfect ccondition. Was actually a birthday gift for son in construction business. Functions as expected Will be used in daily work."
5,Light Weight,"The Paslode 501000 is very comfortable and light weight. I have been using my nailer to install siding on my house. After 2000+ nails, it has never jammed. The ability to set the depth is nice. However, I would improve it be creating a ""quick set"" adjustment. It takes to much time to set the depth setting. I am glad I purchased it!"
5,Good Nailer,"This was my first framing nailer, and I lucked out with a good one. It can get right between studs on a 16"" OC. I have never had a problem with it. The gun is powerful -no problems sinking nails. - Comfortable and well balanced. It is a little loud and has some recoil, although not as much as my full-head nailor. No jams so far. The light weight won't wear you out either. I don't think you can go wrong with this gun."
2,Promising signs,"2 1/2Another prog-metal release where I find myself rooting out any inspiring musical sections amidst flashy, talented metallic riffage and compositional duels. Purists may enjoy this more traditional, less open approach, where already a slight melodic transcendence raises the best sections of the album out of its calculatedly sludgy ruts (see title track's theme!), but the band would improve and open up still to even greater audiences in future releases."
4,well worth getting,"A quality prog-metal album with good to great arrangements and songwriting. Musicianship is excellent, and the vocals are very good. The introductory guitar solo in the superb IN THE DEEPEST OF WATERS is one of the most ripping and incredible I have ever heard."
4,"A ""Heavy"" prog treat","If you are a big fan of heavy-prog music that shreds, like Dream Theater's Images And Words, do yourself a favor and buy this. The music and musicianship is fantastic, the only thing holding this back from a 5-star rating is are the vocals/lyrics.Not that the vocals are bad, or even cheesy, they just arent up to 5-star quality.To be fair, the vocalist Lawrence Mackrory is a decent singer, but he is listed in the cd credits under ""Session Vocals"".Also, ""Extension Of The Wish"" clocks in at just over 44 minutes, a bit short by todays standard (too short for those of us wishing to hear more great shredding).So shred fans, pick this one up and enjoy."
3,"LOSE THE VOCALS, please.","Musicianship is wonderful and intricate. The vocals are brutal and I cringe after every awesome instrumental break only to hear that clown's off-key, poorly arranged vocals almost ruining each track. I say almost because the band comes back with another instrumental section that remedies the ache that jacka$$ did to my ears. I now need to hear the newer releases in full before I commit to buying as I can't purchase this knowing the vocals might be like sniffing a bad fart just as I'm about to eat my beautifully grilled filet mignon steak at a 5-star restaurant...!"
3,"Sorry Ben H. , Mahavishnu orchestra still tops this one","This album is not bad but suffers from the same disease as so many heavy metal bands: too fast. I like real fast guitarplaying but somehow not heavy metal style; I rather turn to the good old Mahavishnu Orchestra for speed guitar. I also likeheavy metal but more the Axel Rudi Pell style. This German guy, largely unknown in america, replaces speed by skilfulcompositions and his singer Goeili sounds so much more powerfulthan the andromeda fellow. As you may see from my other reviews, I don't mind nonhelpful votes but before bombarding me with yours, just do me a favor. Listen to some 30 second sound bytes from Axel Rudi Pell (in particular Oceans of time, shadow zone) and t h e n decide."
5,It Must Be beautiful,This book had some of the best insight on equatiion form i have read in the rescent past.I could read larger sections of it without haviong to go grab a bottle of asprin. The insight it gave on the personal lives and how the evolution of the equation came to be from raw base form to what we learn now is amazing. The sections on Diracs eqaution I found the most intresting. I would reccommend this book to anyone intrested in math and not just the text book side. It takes almost and artistic veiw on math which i have never seen before. Very intresting .DIG IN AND ENJOY
5,One of the best guitarist of the century,This album is not only an expression of artistic talent but also an expression of inspiration and encouragement. all the songs are superbly composed. this cd is one of my favourite cds and i recommend it for anyone who is into music.
5,Excellent gun,"I've been a carpenter for 15 years, and have been trimming houses exclusively for the last 5 years. I purchased my Bostich 7 years ago, and trust me, it has been put through the mill. It has literally shot hundreds of boxes of nails. The only service work I have had to do to it was an O-ring kit (~$15) about a year ago. It's been an excellent gun and I will buy another one when this one finally wears out. It does not hit as hard as say the Hitachi angle nailer, but I feel it is built better, and the nails are considerably cheaper. My partner has the Hitachi and I grab it when I have to sink a 2 1/2"" nail in oak, but other than that, the Bostich does the trick flawlessly. He does not like the Hitachi for the main reason that the spring is not strong enough to advance the nails properly. It was like that right out of the box. It may have a lemon. Don't know. We never got a good answer from the Hitachi rep. At any rate, this Bostich is a solid choice. I highly recommend it."
3,"Good gun, but get the 62 for greater power","I bought the 59 and took it back to Home Depot, then I took a chance on the 62 since I needed to get through maple consistently. If you'll never go through hardwoods this is a good gun, but if you need to punch through hardwoods you can't go wrong with the 62."
1,Kit Gun,"I am just a hobbiest and do not use my gun every day. If you like having to buy o-ring kits, bumper kits, and triggers, go ahead and get one. It seems like every time I go to use it I have to buy a kit or trigger. I have bought enough kits for my gun to buy 3 guns. It's the worse gun I've ever bought. I had a 18ga. Central Pneumatic brad nailer from Harbor Freight that I used a lot more than the N60FN and I never had to put a kit in it. It lasted 20 years. It finally died just recently and I can't get a kit for it. The problem with bostitch nailers is the kits cost way too much. It's kind of like buying a printer. When the ink runs out just go ahead and buy another printer because the ink is more expensive than the printer. I haven't shot but a total of 4 boxes of nails through mine and have had to use four kits and 2 triggers. I don't know if the new version is better than mine, but I'm afraid to try it."
1,Why?,"I fail to understand why reviewers seem to be bowled over by this collection of murky and poorly written stories. If you take the trouble to figure out what's going on, the payoff seems minor compared to the work it took."
1,Unreadable,"I found this book unreadable, the writing style is choppy in the extreme, and I felt nothing for the protagonists, of whom there are too many. I always thought books were supposed to enlighten us about people we may not be like or know personally, that we would actually learn something in the process of reading the book. These people are unlikeable and unlikely.The book is overall too mannered."
4,Compelling look at an often-ignored group,"This is the kind of book that you tear through, because each story (in a collection of interconnected short stories that share common characters) is more compelling than the one before--and then you're disappointed when it's over. We are given glimpses into the back stories of these complicated and interesting 60- and 70somethings, not having read anything about them since they were characters in 1950s fiction or, perhaps a better analogy, any pillbox-hat-and-white-glove-wearing society woman from 1950s American film. The ladies in these stories are the women whom those Eisenhower-era women turned out to be and the story of how they came to be where they are is really good reading. You will not be disappointed."
1,I Didn't Even Finish the Book,This was a selection for my book club and less than 40% of our members bothered to finish the book. Enough said.
2,Majorly Disappointing,"Because of the award nomination and short-story format, I bought this book. I found it boring, honestly. I thought this might be the case because I'm a man and this is about women (though that's not stopped me enjoying books by Amy Tan, Joyce Carol Oates, Jhumpa Lahiri, or Sandra Cisneros but I was thinking there I must be reading something wrong). However, I felt vaildated when my mother - an avid reader - read it and complained about the pace and characters as well. Fortunately, it's a short read so it wasn't a long waste of time."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"I just did a 24 hour turn around of ""Our Kind"" by Kate Walbert. I was interested in checking her out because her new book, ""A Short History of Women"", got such a glowing review in the NYT Book Review a couple of weeks ago. It's about a group of 70 somethings looking back on their lives as mothers/wives in the 1950's and 60's, but also, about their current lives. As you get clearer on the backstories of the characters - what they did in their younger years and how the choices they made effect their lives now - it really starts to come together very powerfully. Not all of the characters receive the same back story treatment, so I was left wondering about some of them, and wished there was more. You have to drop some of your stylistic conventions when reading and just go with the flow - there are images that take your breath away, and an undercurrent of disturbance that is not comforting, but well worth the effort."
3,looking for a song,"i do not know the title, but why was this cd, rearranged. its all mixed up. i used to power walk to this one song andit is not even there, and the sad part about, i do not know the title."
5,James Ingram and John Tesh team up to make a wonderful sound,"James Ingram and John Tesh together have made a beautiful piece of music that will be used at weddings for many years to come. This is truly a beautiful song, and I hope we will be treated to more of this wonderful combination of great talent."
2,john tesh isn't so cool,"I go this cd at the library as a joke, but the joke was on me, i found that john tesh isn't so great, i mean the cd wasn't horrible but really, why does this guy get to put out cd's? really? he's not even a real celebrity. The only song he's ever done that i like was the nba on nbc theme songs, you no what i'm sayin, yeah you know what i'm saying"
5,great quality,"Product is very well made and works perfectly. Also received extremely fast, even with free shipping."
5,"A++ Works like Monster, but only less expensive",Cable works like it supposed to and only cost a fraction of what others cost.
5,Great cable,"Cable works great, arrived promptly, and was cost effective.nice to buy things from GE, an american company."
5,Great Product!!,Needed this cable to complete some audio connections in my home theatre system. This cable by GE is high quality & it is doing a fine job in my system & the Amazon price was very reasonable.
1,Not so good,When I received this product one end was not even attached! I tried to put it back together and make it work which it did not. It wasn't even worth the trouble to ship it back. Went to Radio Shack and bought one.
4,Great Product,Cheaper than other cables and effective so far... Not too pleased with shipping costs though.
3,The first signs of the T.Rex decine.,"I have bought every T.rex album since Electric Warrior on both vinyl and CD and this was the first one that sounded like Marc Bolan was running out of ideas and getting tired. Although the album starts of promising, with powerful songs like ""Venus Loon"" and ""Sound Pit"" the album begins to weeken in the middle and never really recovers.Some of the tracks are rather plain and the style is a little bit all over the place.A lot of it sounds over produced in areas, and the Gloria Jones backing vocals are overdone and uneccessary at times.It was always going to be hard to follow albums like Electric Warrior and The Slider and even Tanx,but Bolan needed a killer at this point in his career and this wasnt it.Having said that it is the last of the Tony Visconti productions and still has some worthwhile moments, although I wouldnt introduce T.Rex to anyone who hadnt heard them, via this album."
3,"Get the alternate version instead,","it's a brilliant T rex album, far better than this even though it's basically the same music. If I didn't know better (and I don't) I'd say Visconti was trying to sabotage this project, it's known he he didn't agree with the direction Bolan wanted to go to get out of glam causing them to split over this recording and it's also evident that although he was a good producer (although not here) he did not feel comfortable outside of rock/folk. The vocals sound as if they were recorded in the bath tub. Anyway I've said enough, get the alternate version and if you are a completeist get T Rex unchained vol 4 which contains material from the zinc sessions (Bolans most extensive) that didn't make it on to the album due it's lenght (nearly 48 minutes)."
3,Marc got tired of being Marc,"I really wanted to like this album when I originally bought it in'74. After thoroughly digesting it, I let it go and I haven't missedit.Other than a few tracks (""Liquid Gang"", ""TheAvengers"", ""Teenage Dream"" and ""PainlessPersuasion""), it is largely unfulfilling. And there was a goodreason for it: Marc had created his persona years earlier, and it wasstarting to choke him like a cucoon. He did not successfully bust outuntil ""Dandy in the Underworld"".This album is notentirely worthless - just the product of a frustrated and confusedgenius. The joy that was evident in '71 and '72 had yielded todistaste for his own creation. Those who consider themselves BolanCompletists, that is they have to have everything, should definitelybuy this. Those who only want his best work should approach this onewith extreme caution. Caveat emptor."
2,This Would Be A Good Album If.....,"it weren't for the horrible backing vocals. There are some great songs on this album no doubt, but unfortunatly Gloria Jones' backing vocals on EVERY single track ruin them completely. All except for 'Teenage Dream' the best track off of this album. I hate to give a T.Rex album two stars, but I just couldn't enjoy the album with all of that racket going on in the back ground."
3,So-so,"I was a little disappointed in the recipes available in this book. They are only so-so. Some are repetitive. I also would have liked more cookie ones such as I had seen in other cake mix cookbooks. (I couldn't get that one as it was out of print, so settled for this one.)"
5,Betty Crocker cake mix cookbook,I am enjoying this cookbook. I was well pleased when I received this book. There are cakes and cookies to be made from cake mixes which makes it a lot easier to make a quick dessert.
3,Cake mix cookbook,"This wasn't as good a cookbook as the Duncan Hines, but I have made a couple things from it and turned out well."
4,Bostitch does it right,"I think the real selling point of this one is the holster. For contractors (especially roofers), a holster is a necessity for the job -- and how often do you see a retailer that sells slap-tacker holsters? And you can trust the quality of every tool Bostitch puts their name on. I'd say this one is a keeper for anybody in the market for slap-tackers."
1,disallusioned handymen,"this is one of the most depressing products that bostitch has ever released- stand alone, it's not horrible, but all it is is a glorified desk stapler that is weighted. to the guy who wrote the review just prior to this one, who mentioned that his h2bs are gathering dust, please send them to me. that is a superior bostitch product. this slap tacker doesn't completely drive the staples when you're trying to move quickly across some #15 felt and only takes one clip at a time. if you're trying to do some serious work, go on ebay and find one of the discontinued h2b staplers- i'm under the impression that product was discontinued because it was overengineered and lasts too long. if you're trying to put up flyers for the senior prom, or the girl scouts car wash fundraiser, this is the stapler for you."
1,Not happy,"I bought 10 tacklers, one for each of my employees and half of them already broke. And then I thought I was going to get the green tackers instead I got the yellow ones. Not happy at all"
2,Nice light tacker that breaks way too easily.,"I am on my second H30. I am a professional flooring installer and at first loved this tacker. Bought a bunch of staples for it and after the second 5000 box, the weld broke on the inside staple slide. Since I had so many staples for it, I bought another and the same thing happened. I rigged a way to load it even with the broken weld, but in my opinion, this is a poor quality Bostitch product. I have used Bostitch brand for nearly 3 deacades and this si the worst so far. Good concept, bad construction."
4,Picture of tacker is not accurate.,"When I placed my order, the Bostitch Tacker pictured was green and the holster was leather. I received a yellow tacker with a composite holster. Both were excellent quality and I have used it several times with no problems. With the box of staples included, I consider this purchase from Antonline a good value but would like to see the picture updated to show exactly what will be shipped."
3,Glad I tracked it down.,"I began my search for ""Casual Gods"" when I heard the song ""Man With A Gun"" at the end of the movie ""Two Moon Junction"". I had that track in my head for weeks before I finally got this album in the mail, and I think the song is hypnotic, sexy, excellent, and worth the purchase alone. ""Rev It Up"" is another great track, and I believe was a single. A few of these songs have a subtle Talking Heads vibe, especially during the ""keyboard solos"", but I suppose that's unavoidable since he was in that band. In the track ""We're Always Talking"" I even hear some ""Roxy Music"" influence. Others worth a mention are ""Song Of Angels"" and ""Let It Come Down"". I'd say the first half of the album is a bit stronger overall. It's too bad all his stuff is out of print since it's quite good. Worth getting like I said, whether you're a fan of Talking Heads, the late 80's, or just good tunes."
2,One great song,"I used the then-hit ""Rev It Up"" on my Talking Heads mix CD. It's very cool, but the rest of the CD did not impact me the same way. Talking Heads CDs are like some other bands -- the songs are either hit or miss, and I generally only took 1-2 songs from each disc, except Little Creatures, which is overall excellent. The Casual Gods artwork is very compelling, something I can rarely if ever say about any CD. I depicts the plight of exploited miners in South America who are forced to manually remove dirt in bags on their backs up rickety ladders from great depths. Compelling.Edit: <rant> Hey, you first two guys did not like my review? Then try picking up your own copy of this out-of-print CD for $2. </rant>"
5,Perfect!!!!!!,This is the best game I don't understand why the overall rating is only 4 stars. I do not think that this game boy color has a dark screen at all. Its the same as the others but better its Tommy Hilfiger!!!!
2,"Stupid, Tacky, Dumb","Game boy is cool but this just makes me sick. Why would anybody pay extra money for a gamboy that is just the same as all game boys but turns you into a walking advertisment for Tommy hillfiger.PS: I don't like the game boy that much any ways. Check out Sega Game gear, it is soooo much beter"
5,Terrific Cookbook and Reference Work,"Juval combines both an extensive reference work on the underlying mechanisms of the .NET system, and at the same time gives complete applications showing the abstractions he concisely presents.In addition, he is very friendly about replying to follow up emails on clarifications you may need on things discussed in or out of the book.I have used this book to build some sophisticated software, and highly recommend the book as to the professional programmer getting started in .NET programming, or to the seasoned programmer that may need to reference something in .NET."
5,Worth every cent!,I have been developing software for 20+ years and am very particular about programming books. This book is my premier C# reference. Juval Lowy covers the topic thoroughly and offers best practices and many well written useful classes.
4,A Must-Have For Every .NET Developer,"Excellent book with terrific coverage of the most important aspects of developing reusable components in .NET with both C# and VB.NET. Overall, one of the best .NET books I have read, and I've read a great number of them.I give it 4 stars because I wish some of the chapters went deeper. In particular, I felt the sidebar on LCE in the Events chapters was insufficient -- I've also read Lowy's ""COM and .NET Component Services"" book from O'Reilly, and between the two, I still don't feel that LCE and asynchronous events are covered sufficiently. I also wish that the context-bound object topic in the book expanded more on the subject, as most of the same material was presented in Lowy's MSDN article from Mar 03."
4,Interfaces Factoring,"On page 73 of this book the author wrote:"" An in-depth discussion of how to decompose a system into components and how to discover interface methods and properties is beyond the scope of this book"".I would encourage the author to write a book that discusses specifically about interface factoring and to provide more examples on how components should be decomposed and organized in large scale applications."
3,Programming .NET Components,"This book has good coverage of a lot of details you'll need to be aware of to properly program .NET components. Unfortunately, it does not give any indication of how to properly integrated your components into the VS framework. As a result, it cannot be considered a complete reference, though it is valuable for other reasons."
5,A must read for every .NET architect and developer,This is a must read for every .NET architect and developer that is doing any type of Product Line Engineering or Framework building. Component-oriented development is the heart of both and this book teaches you how to do it correctly.Mr. Lowy has done a great job of putting everything you need to know about how to do Component-oriented development in .NET 2.0 into one place. I highly recommend this book.
5,Excellent book with an eye for Component Oriented Design,"While going over component and control design, this book teaches the principles of the component-oriented design philosophy. The author doesn't pander and isn't overly verbose; getting to the point and explaining his meaning efficiently and succinctly. Definitely worth the read."
4,A Must For Music Fanatics,"Although a regular reader might not like this book, Pop Music fanatics will find it to be a must have in their collection. If you ever wanted to know what song was number 1 when you were born, what song was number 3 when you got married, or what song was number 6 on the day you got divorced, this is the book for you. I find myself thumbing through it every time a favorite song of mine is on the radio, just to see where the song charted. A must have for any music fan."
1,First lady Last,....The book looses your attention very quickly. Too much trying to set the tone with petty details the phone rang 3 times I took four steps to answer it and then I took a deep breath and it was him. OH please!
5,Great Gun,"By far the best nailer I have ever used. Somtimes hard to find nails, but a can't miss nailer."
1,Wrong Format,This DVD will not play in my DVD player.Why would you ship a European-format DVD to a US address?Will need to return for refund.
5,Beautiful!,This is a beautiful compilation of some of the best global percussion music that I've come across! Everything from water drums to what sounds like stomp.You won't be able to stop playing it!
5,Heart-warming and inspirationally funny,"I don't have cable television, and therefore hadn't seen this show before stumbling on it as a DVD rental. From the first episode, I was instantly hooked. The writing is smart and quick, and the two main characters are extremely likable (Lorelai and Rory). There are some ancillary ""towns folk"" characters that I find more annoying than entertaining, but luckily, I can fast forward through their scenes without losing the gist of the storyline. (God bless DVDs...) If you like to laugh, enjoy intelligent writing, and have a penchant for life in a small New England town, this show delivers."
5,THE BEST SHOW IN THE WORLD!,"This show rocks! I have been a devoted fan since the first epiisode and was thrilled beyond belief when the firdt season was put out on DVD. I am just as thrilled if not more so with the release of the second season. The show just keeps getting better. The season two DVD will be amazing, like the fiirst and hopefully the rest to come. The special features and the amazing episodes make this the greatest thing to come out on DVD, since season one."
3,"came promptly, but problem with one disk","It arrived promptly, which I appreciated. But one of the disks I couldn't get to play, which was obviously a disappointment."
5,Gilmore Girls second season,I bought this for my daughter. She really likes the Gilmore Girls (so do I). It was a great buy. We will purchase more Gilmore Girls seasons. Thanks.
3,Great Show; Not So Great Discs,"""The Gilmore Girls"" is an excellent show, full of fast, witty dialogue and pop culture references you either get or don't get (I was rather proud of myself when I understood every reference they made in the third episode of this season.) That being said, I have no problem with the show itself in this season.However, the discs have a tendency to pause for a second or two at least three times during each episode. I find this to be irritating, but not bad enough to return the product.Overall, this is a great show that was put on not so great DVDs."
4,Great gift,"My Mom lovs the Gilmore Girls, and this was purchased for her as a Christmas present. It's such a great show, and she really enjoys it. It was very timely, and came in time for Christmas! I would certainly consider purchasing other movies/series from here."
3,Good.,"The box was a little more beat up than I expected, but the DVD's work great. I am glad to have this."
5,Amazing show!!!,"I love Gilmore Girls. It is an amazing show with incredible characters and a good plot. You will fall in love with these characters the moment you see them. The Second season is almost as good as the first, and totally worth seeing. I highly recommend it!!"
5,Great show!,"Somehow I missed this show while it was running on t.v. Received the first season as a gift, and now am ordering the next season. Looking forward to receiving it!"
5,Gilmore World,"If you like Girlmore Girls show, you will enjoy the Complete 2nd Season, especially without commercials! You feel like you're living it with them, that you are in ""Gilmore World"". It's a great show with well written characters. My family enjoys the very fast paced wit and multi cultural references. Fortunately, there's also reference booklets in the package to help you with the ""Gilmorisms""."
5,Gilmore Girl Purchase,I have all the Gilmore Girls Series and have watched them so many times that I needed to replace my Second Season. My transaction was quick and DvDs were in great condition as stated. I was extremely happy with the seller of my product! And obviously would highly recommend the Gilmore Girls.
5,Lorelai and Rory,"These to are full of it and it makes things very entertaining. Funny, interesting, with witty humor."
2,French view,"Well, I am a 38 French guy, just for you to know. I had been charmed by season 1. But season 2 gets old pretty fast I think. Overall nothing much happens in season 2. It is mostly a lot of talking to fill out the gaps. The last episode is more exciting to watch but it is no surprise as they just want you to buy season 3 so they make you want more at the end of the last episode. they should have done that with each episode in the season, which they didn't. I was disappointed in not being addicted to it as I had been with THE O.C or ONE TREE HILL.The other problem I have with this show is the unrealistic way the characters express themselves, you know you can tell someone wrote every single thing they say. I found it original in season 1 and got tired of it. Buy ONE TREE HILL instead if you haven't done already."
1,Gilmore Girls - The Complete Second Season,HAS I COMPLETED THE 1ST SEASON OF GILMORE GIRLS I HAVE ORDER THE 2ND SEASON BUT SO FAR IAM STILL WAIT TO SEE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY PARCEL SO FAR SO LET SEE HOW MORE TIME IT WILL TAKE
4,"Entertaining, perhaps better than season 1","Gilmore Girls returns, this time with a more seasoned cast, and the addition of a few more characters such as: ""Jess,"" Luke's delinquent uncle and more appearences from Cristopher, Lorelai's ex.I particularly liked the relationship between Dean and Rory, and I was pleasantly suprised to see the eldest Lorelai a trifle less of a motormouth this season. As usual, the Gilmore's parents, the French concierge, Luke and some of the other townsfolk were excellent.I admit I'm not a huge fan of Christopher (Lorelai's ex), and I just don't see any chemistry between him and Lorelai. I also don't like the character of Jess as I find him rather irritating. He does stir things up, however.4 Stars. Entertaining fun."
5,BEST SHOW ON T.V.,The Second Season of Gilmore Girls began with Lorelei's answer to Max's proposal and plans the wedding. Lorelei then has second thoughts and calls off the wedding and decides to start planning for running her own inn. Rory contiunes dating Dean but also likes Luke's nephew Jess. Sookie and Jackson's get married and Lorelei briefly dates Rory's father Christopher. Each eps. was hilarious.
5,This show is just The Best!!,"Hello guys and customers!I'm a German girl, 35 years old and I was so glad that the Gilmore Girls started to show in April over here in Germany. They broadcasted the first three seasons and I just thought ""WOW"". This show is so much fun, wit, charm and love - you have to watch it! Because I am a fan of the English language and like more the original voices than the synchronized dialogues, I bought the first season on DVD and I was so happy to be able to watch and understand it that I pre-ordered the second season as soon as it was possible.I love how the actors play their roles. They seem to be so deep in their roles that you sometimes don't know if they are playing or if they really ARE the persons. It is so real, so wonderfully played, and I love Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson and the young Alexis Bledel, because they do their job with heart and soul. Of course every other actor on this show is great as well.Go and watch this show - it is terrific!!!"
5,Gilmore Girls-The complete second season,I just finished watching the whole season 2 of the gilmore girls and don't regret it for buying this. It's a must have!
5,Duh it's the Gilmore Girls,Refer to title! Then remember Melissa McCarthy is Lorelei's best friend. Along with all the other great cast members! Ok
5,Gilmore Bliss,"Wife loves the series and I find myself enjoying them, as well. There are seven seasons, so plenty more to pickup after this one."
5,I'm A Guy and I'm Glad My Daughter got me hooked on It,"Fast shipping. Everyone will find something in here that rings true. If your childhood was void of some important family relationships, you will get it here. Great believable characters 93% of the time. Very very good acting, especially from the grandparents. Enjoy!"
4,Gilmore Girls is Gilmore Girls,"I always love this show and with this being the second season, there's definitely a lot ore character developing and fun. Not too much heaviness as Rory is at a new school and Lorelai figuring things out with Suki for the Inn and new Inn. Definitely recommend."
5,gilmore girls,"i so love this series.i have never been so devoted in watching a show in years! All casts fit their characters like a glove. i wish that luke and lorelei would get married and live happily ever after.it will break my heart if they break up.through all their joys and tears, i wish that this show would not end."
1,Wow.,"This product is horrible. It said it was ""guaranteed to play"", which I guess actually translates to ""guaranteed to play for ten minutes, then will start skipping and freezing every ten seconds"". I have never been more disappointed by anything in my life, particularly because this was my mother's Christmas present. Thank you for ruining Christmas with your false advertising, seller. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Gilmore Girls Season 2,"I bought this item and was watching it and enjoying it. I got to disc 4 and it was HORRIBLE and UNWATCHABLE. I am very, very sorry about the purchase. I have since bought the whole season and of course, a brand new set. Will never buy used again. I bought the whole set from Amazon and it was wonderfully packed and it is brand new and do not anticipate any problems."
4,Great Beginners Book,This book was a very helpful guide with great coloured pictures. It's easy to read and understand. With this book I was finally able to identify some plants that I had.
3,Guide to Growing Healthy Houseplants,Overall very concise and informative on each specific house plant. My only peeve is that the pictures of each species be larger. Small pictures makes it hard to identify the right species of unknown plants.
4,Where is the afterparty ?,"In this fifth LP, Jimmy Gestapo and his gang perfected their style of New York Hardcore party music. The songwriting has been polished over the years and the neophyte can easily appreciate, but the connaisseur will still recognize the jagermeister-oozing, beer-soaked, ganja-smelling party spirit. It is a good follow-up to the excellent Dedicated, but keep in mind the best ones are the first two albums.Something worth mentioning is that every Murphy's Law album contains one ska song and one reggae song that truly are jewels in their contemporary genre. The saxophone is crazy.That band is still active and you should definately check them out because they throw sick parties. No matter if you're a skinhead, a hardcore kid, a ska fan or a drunken glue sniffer, you don't know how to party if you don't know Murphy's Law.Jimmy G if you're reading this please release a new album !!"
3,Works good but I have no other comparison,"My dad who has worked as a carpenter for 25 years bought me this gun as a present. He is a fan of Bostich and their quality. I have been buying Porter Cable and have found no reason to switch after using this stapler. It has worked fine for me after about 1000 staples and has never jammed. I have found that about 1 in 50 shots delivers no staple. In addition, the magazine is so well enclosed, I cannot tell when I am empty. Becase of the feed problem, half the time I do not get a staple, I think that I am empty and try to reload... finding a half full magazine. I have also found that the depth setting does not seem to work. Set at any level, it seems to deliver a flush or slightly raised staple, but not in a consitant manner. Overall, I am statisfied, but hoped for better; given my druthers, I would try an alternate brand if I bought another finish stapler on my own."
4,Great Rock & Roll Compilation!,"Great strait up rock & roll. From the opening riff of the Newlydeads ""Lipstick"" to the last note of Dragbeat's ""Pure Dirt"" this album will not disappoint. If strait ahead, no B.S. rock & roll is your bag, get this disc.highlights:-The Narcotics : ""Four Feet Down""-American Heartbreak : ""Postcards From Hell""-The Newlydeads : ""Lipstick""-Junkyard : ""Waste Of Time""-Faster Pussycat : ""Blood""In fact the only bad tune in the bunch is ""Leather Boyz..."" by Pretty Boy Floyd. The rest of the album is pretty much perfect."
4,Strong debut solo album reissued,"Under the questionable sheen of late 80s production techniques and sythesizers, the genius of Brian Wilson is found in these recordings for the first time since 1977's ""Love You"" album, recorded with the Beach Boys. Wilson is ambitious on his first time out alone (although with the help of several producers and the strange influence of Dr. Eugene Landy) with the magnificent suite Rio Grande, while Love and Mercy and Melt Away rank with his best songs. This album is not on the level of Wilson's prime 1960 Beach Boy recordings, but is an interesting look into the later years of a musical genius and is sure to be worth any fan's time."
3,Love & Mercy And Little Else,"Love & Mercy says it all. Brian ""Genius"" Wilson...Who else could have crafted such a breath taking beautiful song? Yes, Love & Mercy is as good as ANYTHING Brian ever wrote. No kidding...It is really on the same level as God Only Knows, Good Vibrations, Add Some Music To Your Day, Wouldn't It Be Nice and anything else you might consider as ""top-shelf"" from the enormous Brian Wilson catalog.But what of the balance of the material contained herein? I'm afraid to say there is little else to get excited over. Let's Go To Heaven In My Car, Too Much Sugar, There's So Many....Man I wish I could offer some kind words for these dreadful songs. ""I keep on pushing"" Brian sings on Walkin' The Line and oh boy is he ever pushing. Brian's genius has always been his great songwriting and production. Perhaps he'd be better suited concentrating on these and give singing a rest."
5,BUY THIS CD!!!!!,"Boy oh boy - - the album proper is de-mudded [made mud-free?], the bonus tracks sound fantastic, and the piece as a whole is as documentary as anything Don Was ever dreamed of. What a time capsule!"
4,Strong debut solo album reissued,"Under the questionable sheen of late 80s production techniques and sythesizers, the genius of Brian Wilson is found in these recordings for the first time since 1977's ""Love You"" album, recorded with the Beach Boys. Wilson is ambitious on his first time out alone (although with the help of several producers and the strange influence of Dr. Eugene Landy) with the magnificent suite ""Rio Grande"", while ""Love and Mercy"" and ""Melt Away"" rank with his best songs. This album is not on the level of Wilson's prime 1960 Beach Boy recordings, but is an interesting look into the later years of a musical genius and is sure to be worth any fan's time.The bonus track are sort of a strange yet sometimes satisfying nature. None of them are classics but they provide a further window into the Brian Wilson of the late 80's. They certainly do not really go with the flow of the album, so consider them an amanded EP."
4,The best 80's Beach Boys Album,"The Beach Boys has been one of my most favourite bands in the 60's (another is the Beatles). And the talent of Brian Wilson has made loads of hits and brilliant songs over 30 years. Ironically, when the Beach Boys release the No.1 hit single ""Kokomo"" in 1988, without Brian, his first solo album was only get much weaker commercial response. However, I think ""Love and Mercy"" is one of his classic songs and match the quality of his best 60's songs. ""Melt Away"", ""Baby Let Your Hair Grow Long"" and ""Rio Grande"" are also my favourite tracks in the album.Of course, the treasure of this CD reissue is the bonus tracks (there are eleven of them!). All Beach Boys fans can't miss it!"
4,A fine reissue of a near-classic album,"I was 16, and already a Beach Boys fanatic, when this first came out, and I was delighted to see it was being reissued in a remastered version. It sounds great ... at least a few of the tracks sound like they were remixed as well as remastered; ""Love and Mercy"" seems to have extra synth parts that weren't on the original CD at all (listen to the end of the wordless bridge just before the chorus comes back in), and the end of ""Melt Away"" sounds quite different. In any case, the sound is mighty fine, and the bonus tracks are generous and worth at least a listen or two."
4,Better than the ones that came with the humidifier,"These filters are bigger and sturdier than the ones that came with the filter. However, just like the ones that came with the filter, they shrink upon use. Once a week, soak them in vinegar and turn them over. Soaking them prolongs their usefulness. They should last a season."
4,Expanding into greater areas,"Brian Transeau is one of the most thoughtful artists in music today. He blends beautiful vocals accompanied with orgasmic beats. And Movement in Still Life is no different. From Ima, through Escm., and into the Go soundtrack, BT has expanded his artistic ability. He continues on that path with this most recent import. The tracks include Godspeed which is much like his older stuff, along the lines of Flaming June, very earthly and epic. But he grows with songs that sound more involved with a break-beat sound. But it's when he returns to old form that he truly excels. There are tracks that are, for lack of a better word, beautiful. I truly recommend this album. It's worth the import price."
4,Excellent Energy,"I am a relatively new fan of techno and I must say that I find BT to be consistent and energetic. The thing that attracted me to techno to begin with is the complexity of rythym bound together in one presentation. BT does this beautifully, and the first time I listened to ""Godspeed"" I had goosebumps. BT drew me into this world, as he was the first artist I was introduced to. I have just purchased two of his other works, R&R and ESCM and will review those later. For anyone who is looking to get into techno, I recommend BT. Warning: Do not listen to over and over again, like the NC gent mentioned. It is true. It's like a great movie, you wish you hadn't seen it already so you can enjoy it for the first time all over again."
2,A major disappointment for a talented artist,"BT's third full length CD, ""Movement In Still Life"", contains moments of greatness, but is plagued by material that at best is second rate. Only on tracks, such as ""Dreaming"", ""Godspeed"", and ""Mercury and Solace"", does BT deliver what he does so well, that is, deliver trance which is well a cut above commercial trance. Not that everything else is bad, but there is nothing fresh or innovative about the other songs on this CD. BT's first two CD's fully embraced techno/trance music's driving beat. Here, it is in dire short supply. One has to wonder if there is an American phobia with having such a prominent beat. If you are new to BT, you would do well to buy his first two CDs instead of this one. Of course, you can buy this CD only because the cover has a great picture of him."
1,VERY disappointing,"I've heard Godspeed, Dreaming, and some other songs by BT on various trance compilation CDs so I bought this CD, thinking that it should be a pretty good trance CD... Sadly, I couldn't stop myself from pressing the fast forward button as soon as the first song started playing. The only two songs I can listen to without fast forwarding any part of it was Godspeed and Dreaming (but even Dreaming was disappointing since the one I've heard before was a remix and this one is not). The songs on this album is more rap/alternative-ish, so if you are looking for nice trance/rave music (like how I was), this is soooo not the CD to buy. You would be a lot better off spending the money on a trance compilation that has the BT song you're looking for (such as Godspeed)."
4,The Next Level,"I just bought this album and haven't had a chance to listen to it fully, but no joke - this album is worth it for just cuts 1 and 2! And the great thing about BT is that his albums bring depth and new discoveries at every listening. His writing and production skills are through the roof. If you haven't checked out IMA or ESCM, I highly recommend them both also."
2,A big dissapointment,"I fell in love with his ""ESCM"" album which was truly a masterpeace, even his first album was good, but this is far from trance music. Here we have fillers and songs that are just too far away from trance as possible like ""Madskillz"" and ""Never gonna come back down"" Only a few songs are good actually ""Dreaming"" ""Goodspeed"" and ""Mercury and solance"", those are also following the old style of enjoyable quality trance. I don't know why he decided to go commercial and change something succesful to the worse. This album only get's 2 stars and that's because it's not what i want to hear when i check for dream dance in the store."
2,Weak,"I know that there's already a million other people saying ""Buy the import"", but it bears repeating. The original UK version is a very well-designed trance album that covers a lot of ground and has some remarkable singles, all segued together well. This US version, though, feels like a group of 50-something record executives sat around and stripped the album to get on radio and soda commercials.I can't outright pan the album, because it does have ""Godspeed"" and ""Dreaming"". But please, please, please buy the import, not this imitation trance album."
3,European version much better,"I bought the european version of this album about six months before it came out in the U.S. I liked it so well that I bought BT's other two albums. When this album finally came out in the U.S. I noticed that it had several different songs than the european version. At first I was excited that there might be some new songs that I would like. However, I found that, basically, all the ""european"" trance songs had been replaced with rock/hip-hop crossover songs. I guess the producers or BT were trying to make the CD more appealing to the U.S. market, which is probably less trance-savvy than Europe. But, I liked the european version much better. If you like Sasha or Paul Van Dyk, you'd probably be surprised that two of the songs cut on the american version were collaborations with these two artists. Overall, the european version has a many more trance tracks. Though it may cost more, I think getting the european CD is the better deal. I would give that CD five stars."
2,Terribly Derivative,"I wonder what was going through BT's head when he made this horrible album. His first two albums IMA and ESCM were classics but Movement in Still Life is just the worst techno albums I have heard this year and as well as one of the worst albums in general this year. I get the impression on this cd that Brian was attempting to make that big breakthrough like Moby did with Play. Although Movement in Still Life is different to Play, the album lacks any charm and beauty and comes off rather derivative. The only songs I like on this cd is Mercury and Solace and Dreaming which is why I gave this cd two stars instead of one."
2,"I hate to be the antagonist here, but...","I don't see how these people here have rated this cd so highly! We had this stinking thing back-ordered for weeks and rejoiced when it arrived. But we were misled. Frankly, I'm very disappointed in BT. Ima and ESCM were very, very good, but the only redeeming quality of this work is the Mercury and Solace track (a track we already owned on another compilation). I usually love BT. This is different; like a poor attempt to break into mainstream trip-hop or something. Oakenfold, Van Dyk, and BT: all very talented artists. I have to wonder if the record contract is responsible for this nonsense. Sorry, BT; this is just the way we're feeling out here."
3,Import is better,"Bt's music is incredible, but the import of Movement in still life is 100 times better. The recording is cleaner, beautiful transitions and most of the cd is great, while the US version sounds like a compilation of singles and not particularly good ones, of course, with the exception of mercury and solace, and other great ones. #2 on the cd is not on the import version, but it is far out! # 2 is worth the price of the cd. If you are serious into BT you would enjoy the import better."
2,Sell Out....,"After ESCM was released, I read a review that hailed BT as the artist most likely to bring trance into mainstream consciousness, so long as he could bridge a gap with pop. Unfortunately, it seems like that's what he attempted here, only he went way too far. These tracks have none of the innovation or passion of his earlier releases. All that's left is a boring, progressive pop album that will play to top-40 audiences much more effectively than his true fans or club listeners. Even the standout track Heaven Scent is a weak version - you can find more uplifting, EnErgizing mixes of it almost anywhere. Here's hoping BT will return to his roots on his next efforts....."
2,"No movement, NO SIGNS OF LIFE - BT's latest is D.O.A.","One of Paul Van Dyk's most fruitful professional partners and a quality electronic musician, BT has created such amazing tracks as ""Namistai"", ""Mercury and Solace"", and ""Godspeed"", among many others. He's also released several previous albums that have garnered the American considerable critical acclaim.Naturally, I thought this album was gonna rock... the thing is, and I'm sure you'll agree with me, that every track on this album (that's any good at all) has already been remixed into a better piece and put on a compilation somewhere by someone. I was totally unimpressed with this release, maybe if he had some passionate original mixes of one of the more obscure winners, like ""Running Down The Way Up""... but BT eventually leaves us searching for a sign of life in ""STILL LIFE"". I hope his next is better.Good luck Brian, we still love you."
5,Godfather of Trance does it again!!!,"By far the greatest thing this master of sound has released to date! BT has never been the stereotypical dance/trance artist with anything he's done, and with MISL he shatters that conception, proving once again that BT is a force to be reckoned with. From the beginning of the CD, BT takes you on a tour of his world of tasty knob-tweaking, effects-laden delights. From the humble and mid-tempo beginnings of the title track to the soft and sweet endings of ""Satellite"", you are taken on a non-stop journey through the annals of audio wizardry. BT brings you in slowly, builds the pace to a frenzied tempo, then releases you into a dream-like state of contentedness. I could write all day about how amazing this album truly is, but as with all art, the beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This album simply must be heard to be believed."
1,"Please, whatever you do, GET THE IMPORT!","Had I not gotten the import version of this CD (and then lost it and repurchased the US version, thinking they were one and the same) I never would have known just how weak this compilation is in comparison. The import version of this CD is instantly recognizable as pure BT... the CD is beautifully mixed together and weaves seamlessly from song to song, whereas the US version just doesn't have the same continuity. Several tracks from the UK version are also missing on the US version, what replaces them I would call pablum at best. (I can't remember what's missing and my UK version is GONE!) Under no circumstances would I recommend this CD over the import."
2,so disappointed,"If you are one to follow and purchase all of Brian Transeau's great musical works, this is not an IMA or an ESCM! This is more like an experiment into pop/rock/hiphop. Although there are some great songs on this disk (Godspeed + Mercury and Solace are re-released) much of the disk is weak and messy. You start to miss BT's old style as you listen to each track. Of the newer tracks the highlights would be Dreaming, Running down the way up, and smartbomb. I've heard that the Import is many times stronger than this release (US), so check the import. Also, check out BT's ESCM for a more refreshing envigorating selection of beautifully crafted songs instead."
5,"BT...DJ Rap...M. Doughty, all my favorite!","I work at a Virgin Megastore and the first time I sampled this on one of the listening stations I about lost it completely. I havent heard the import copy but the domestic works just fine for me! MY favorite track on this album which people seem to be forgetting about is #2 ""Never going to come back down"" Since Soul Coughing broke up Ive been waiting and waiting to here M. Doughty collaborate with some other artists and this is fabulous, on top of that BT worked with DJ Rap on the very same track! All you people out there trying to bash on breaks...GET OVER IT! Its getting big all on its own...just listen to any late night radio stations in your area, I guarantee you will hear many new songs coming out in a breakbeat mix. I give props to BT on this album for not pinning himself down to any single genre stereotyping! What a very mighty album this is..check it out and get all your friends addicted to something healthy for a change!"
5,Fave,"This album is off the chizzain if you're into techno or dance music. I like the different mixes that bt uses in his songs. Although some of his songs are a little difficult to understand when trying to grasp the message of them, he still manages to succeed with his beats and sounds. No disappointment here!!!"
2,Buy the Import!,"Was very disappointed with the US release of this album - all the songs are cut into singular, radio-ready size sound bites that are just mere shadows of the brilliance of the UK release. I don't fault BT for this - the record execs apparently think us Americans can't handle an epic trance album in the format it was originally intended. On the US release, beginnings and ends of songs don't make sense, e.g., ""Running"" and ""Satellite"" are one consistent 15 minute experience on the UK release; on the US version, they're cut down SIGNIFICANTLY and are out of order!My only regret was that I wasted ten bucks and waited three weeks for a sub-par release. Spend a little extra, get the import +9 off of Amazon, and go home happy."
4,Incredible-,"I picked this up randomly at a store...and was enthalled from the very beginning.Buy this...if you like dance, trance, or something to move to.It's worth it just for track 3, ""Dreaming,"" which took me to another planet...."
2,"Generic, Slick, and Uninteresting.","Okay, so its well produced.Okay, so some of the melodies are kind of catchy.Okay, so its BT.Okay, so he even sells Apple products I own and love.But this record just has no soul. It's a series of tracks with no cohesion (other than they fade into eachother), and there's no theme to the disc.It's well made techno, but it has no feeling to it. It leaves me feeling cold and wondering what the point of it was.With so much good electronic music out there, one might think that BT would have picked up on what makes the rest of it (such as Eat Static or Hallucinogen, or dare I say The Chemical Brothers or The Crystal Method) so good.BT has had a lot of success lately, largely from good marketing, and a slick image. I think that perhaps what has happened is the quality of music has gone down because there hasn't been any feedback but positive. My suspicion is he has fallen prey to his own (or his label's own) marketing engine.Move along folks, nothing to see here."
5,"3/4 trash, 1/4 genius","The first 3/4 of this cd sounds like Pan Sonic (Vainio's more popular project with Ilpo [insert finnish name starting with V here]), but instead of layered, all strung out end to end - a pop here, a crack there, some static, some white noise, etc. It's interesting I guess but wholly unfulfilling; I wouldn't want this cd except...The last 1/4 (the last track clocking in at around 15 minutes) of this record is pure genius - viher[green] is without question a classic of ambient music, equalled maybe by only 4 or 5 tracks I've ever heard. The music just disappears into the environment, hardly even noticable yet causing a profound change in the surroundings. Astounding and infinity% worth the price of the record."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"This kit does NOT contain an aluminum, cleaning rod as advertised. It is steel just like every other .204 cleaning kit on the market. I thought I had found the exception but, alas, it was not to be. Amazon: check your products before you advertise something it is not!"
4,DARREN,"This is an open and refreshing book from an author who I have long enjoyed. Very few writers in Christian circles write with the depth and honesty that he does. This book is highly recommended for anyone who feels a little lost or just wants to live at a higher level. It is not written from an authoritative perspective, but from that of a fellow traveler on life's highways. Very enjoyable read."
5,Awesome,Inspiring book that denounces the dutiful life and teaches you to live with purpose and passion for Christ.
3,"Good points, but too much quoting.","I have to admit that I didn't quite finish the book. The biggest problem I had was that he constantly quoted other people and more times than not, it took away from the context that he was in. When I began to skip all the quotes I actually enjoyed the book a lot more.The content of the book itself was good and should help to bring most people out of any type of ""rut"" they might be experiencing. His general outlook on life and our desires was an inspiration in and of itself.In the end I didn't read the last few chapters simply because to me the point was driven home about half way through the book. I would really be interested in reading a book by this author with no quoting in it, he has a great writing ability, but the problem to me was almost half the content seemed to come from others, which to me actually seemed to take away from his own writing ability."
5,One of the really important books I've read this year!!!,"The author left me re-thinking some long held assumptions about desire, holiness and sanctification. For those of us who are prone to function out of duty, this is liberating reading. He could be, at times, a little verbose for my taste, but I was more than happy to wade through some tedious stylistic elements to get what he had to say. It's really, REALLY good. I'd suggest reading it slowly with a pen and paper close by."
3,Just Okay,"The best part of this novel for me was its evocation of the locale. It made me want to visit Darjeeling myself. I thought the plot was sort of a soap-opera, but I have to admit I did not foresee the outcome. It was a satisfying conclusion, though. An Indian acquaintance pointed out that the love triangle is a staple of Indian cinema. The writing attempted to be lyrical in its descriptions, and sometimes succeeded. However, the language was too often awkward and a little off. I'm guessing it's because English was not the author's first language, resulting in strange off-kilter usages. I don't know why her editor didn't straighten these out."
4,Milwaukee hole saw,"I purchased this hole saw to cut holes in my motorcycle windscreen so I could install aviation type vents. This saw did a perfect job. It is round and sharp. The varriable pitch on the tooth pattern kept it from chattering. My only complaint is that I used it with a Klein mandrell. The hole pattern for the set pins was off just enough that the saw did not install tight on the mandrell. This may be due to the age of my mandrell, or the difference in brands. In all this saw did the trick at a reasonable price. The vendor was also very prompt with delivery."
5,Loads of fun!!,This was the first game (and so far only game) that I have bought for my PSP. I bought it because I have played Diner Dash online and have thoroughly enjoy it.
3,Its okay!,"Its not a bad game I really enjoyed playing it and replaying it between classes and waiting for clients for work, really over all its a great casual game for a casual gamer!"
4,good choice,"Great practice for learning letter positions on keyboard. Challenging and fun activities for practices. Disappointed, though, that it did not go to the next level of providing opportunities for words, sentences, and paragraph practices. This would be a great additions for the software creators to think about adding in the ""next"" version."
5,Miracle Working Product!,"I had recurring UTI's which made me so sick. I am allergic to antibiotics, having tried so many in the past, only to develop hives, itching, and other symptoms from the supposed ""treatment"". I began to research on the internet for ""something"" natural to help me. I was so desperate. I found D=Mannose and overnighted it to my house. I have no regrets! I began a regimen of D-Mannose in my tea four to five times per day. If I feel any discomfort coming on I start a morning routine of one scoop a day for about a week. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is ""chronic"", you will find relief, as well as a healthful and ""easy"" remedy that you can take everyday to prevent another UTI. I also use Cranberry caps on a regular basis when a UTI flares up. But make sure to drink lots of water!!!"
4,La FemmeNIkita = the first three seasons,"I had videotaped all of the programs live, but that included the commercials, and the quality of the tapes were not near as clear as the CDs. It's a great package for true La Femme Nikita fans. Hopefully the shortened ""Fourth"" season will be available in the future."
2,disappointing,"This book is marginal at best. Very short, quick read with type large enough for a children's book (probably looking for filler pages to get it past 200). Nothing new for someone who followed it in the popular press as the events were happening.The book also does a poor job of explaining relevant details surrounding the markets of the time, especially with respect to the inner working of Swiss Bank. The author also fails to examine the exact nature of the losses in the equity division within UBS... maybe his knowledge of derivatives rates right up there with the man responsible for the downfall."
1,Valor has some nerve.,"First of all, this is the cheapest, ugliest cover art in a long string of sloppily thrown together, poorly edited CDs from Valor, the usurper and poltroon currently in command of Christian Death.Secondly, it is unspeakable that Valor has chosen to cover songs written and performed by Rozz, in particular ""Cavity,"" when Valor has disregarded the existance of ""Only Theatre of Pain"" in the Christian Death catalog since he stole the name from Rozz in the 80s.This album is an insult to Rozz Williams' memory and is evidence that Valor Kand is nothing more than an egomaniacal, talentless hog who has taken a once-amazing goth band and transformed it into Z-grade death metal cheese."
1,"Valor, you f***","Hearing this unprinipled charlatin sing "" Sleepwalk "" and "" Cavity ""--ROZZ'S SONGS!!!!!!!!!!---I feel like i need a bath and my ears flushed out."
1,Worst Thing I ever bought!,"This product was expensive; and of very CHEAP QUALITY... I don't even think it's base is real metal. It feels more like a hard plastic. When you ""thump"" the base, it does have that solid metal sound. I know quality and this isn't it. I depended on other reviews I'd read to gauge my decision to buy... I'll never buy another Lamp online."
3,metal case review,The case is generally a good case. The only problem is that it is heavy and get's banged up pretty badly in the back of the truck. A blowmolded case might be better and easier to deal with... maybe even a place for wrenches to adjust the depth and a place for a few racks of nails just in case.
3,Battery dies in 3 minutes,"I didn't really like this trimmer, with the safety on it isn't short enough, and without it is way too short. I wish there was an in between length. Also the rechargeable battery dies in 3 minutes or less after being fully charged. Next time I'll try a remington.Hope this helps. It should be less than 3 stars..."
2,Few highlights...,"The John Tesh Project is an effort to give ""undiscovered"" artists some recording time. Tesh wrote 6 of the 10 tracks, which are for the most part not very enjoyable. The exception for me is ""When Will Our Love Find A Way"". It's a tender tune that is well suited for the soprano sax. Eric Marienthal plays the tune well. He and Jeff Kashiwa seem to be the artists I like best on the album. I like Kashiwa on the cover of ""Rocket Man"", which I think is the best track of the album. ""Polar Express"" isn't bad, but that is just because I really enjoy the guy playing the flugel horn. The disc has good sound quality, but the music leaves quite a bit to be desired."
1,"Ahhh,","Thats it, I lack the discriptive ability to properly attack music this bad,this devoid of value."
3,Some Great Songs but Puzzling Execution,"""Eye No"",the crafted pop of ""Alphabet Street"" and ""Glam Slam"",the percussive ""Dance On"" and the dancable tital song arehighlites but I must deduct starts for two reasons.Every song on ""Lovesexy"" is recorded as a suite,without breaks,on one 40 plus minute cut-it's impossible to skip to individual songs,a questionable artistic desition.Whitch is a pity because it's a fairly incosistant album that could have and still does deserve a better presentation.But the way the music is going these days c'est le vie?"
3,would have been killer ep,from eye no to the mind-numbing annie stesia this was a disc that appeared to be a must have.but after A.S. the disc falls flat and goes all over the place.still though it felt like prince unlike the last 11 years.
3,"Great album, but could have been better.","Lovesexy has 3 strikes against it: the 1 track setup, ""Eye No"" and ""Positivity"" (two of the worst songs he's ever recorded). That doesn't necessarily stop me from listening to the album. If you get past those two songs this album put's itself up there near the top. Lovesexy would have been an excellent 4 star album, but certain factors bring it down to 3."
2,He's Done Better,"Prince had recorded two albums at the time of the release of Love Sexy. One was by the good Prince (Love Sexy) and the other by the bad Prince (The Black Album). The story goes that the good Prince won out and Prince released Love Sexy. The album is full of positive notions about love and God. The problem is that the unreleased Black Album(it was released in a limited edition several years later) was far superior to Love Sexy. ""Alphabet St."" has a nice funky groove with a guitar riff reminiscent of ""Kiss"" and is a good song, but the album doesn't offer much else. One would be better served to find a copy of the Black Album as that contains some of the darkest, deepest, funkiest grooves Prince has ever committed to tape. Love Sexy just doesn't match up the high standards that he had set with his previous 80's releases."
4,ALL his music rules,"Prince is a musical genius, that's all there is to it. My favorites from the CD? 2. Alphabet Street 3. Glam Slam 4. Anna Stesia 6. Love SexyI'v never heard a musician that can make my body move like Prince does.. his beat and rythm never cease to amaze me.. every little bit he puts in his songs are great. Nothing is wasted. He's been my favorite musician and artist since 1981. Rarely can an artist have that kind of loyal following and longevity."
5,Why isnt this masterpiece an amazon.com essential?,"This is one of the most spiritual and uplifting albums ever released. Prince once again proves his genius and expresses his feelings about the state of the world, people and love4oneanother. This album is in the vibe of Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, expanding the listener's mind while opening thier hearts. If u need a powerful message and uplifting lyrics purchase this album. Wonderfully produced and arranged its as good as anything Prince has released. Appreciate the depth and listen 2 the album in its entirety. U will feel enlightenment at the end of the album. Listen 2 the rushing water, u will relate."
3,Good for a few quickies,Another stale synthesis of late eighties pop-rock-dance-funk expectedly containing at least a few proofs as to why we celebrate his royal lineage.
3,"""Love Erratic""","Prince's follow-up to the triumphant ""Sign 'O' the Times"" is a slight letdown. ""Lovesexy"" (1988) certainly has its moments: ""Glam Slam,"" ""Eye No,"" ""Anna Stesia,"" ""I Wish U Heaven"" and the extended ""Alphabet St."" Unfortunately, the remaining songs are forgettable, including ""When 2 R in Love"" (a weak ballad lifted from the legendary ""Black Album""). Whenever Prince decides to remaster ""Lovesexy,"" he should include the ""Alphabet St."" instrumental remix as a bonus track."
2,LOVE WITH PAIN,"I AM AN ADORING FAN OF PRINCE BUT THIS TIME HE INCORPORATES THE HELP OF OTHER ARTISTS AND HE MISSES EXCELLENCE. UNLIKE HIS PREVIOUS ALBUM SIGN OF THE TIMES THIS ALBUM MISSED THE MARK, THAT'S WHY IT'S ONLY MEDIOCRE. I SUGGEST DIAMONDS AND PEARLS, OR PRINCE'S EARLIER WORK. I BELIEVE HE GOT TIRED ON LOVESEXY AND WANTED TO TAKE A BREAK. HE PROBABLY KNOWS IT."
2,Very Messy,"Through out the 80's, Princes' standard in artistry and production was nothing short of amazing. ""alphabet st."", ""dance on"", ""love-sexy"" and ""I wish u heaven"", were all strong tracks with much potential. The finishing result was a 45 minute mish-mash of noise that has destroyed the joy of listening to these four particular songs. The mastering process of the album, resulted in one single track (very unusual) (that's prince), but overall, the album sounds awful. Many of the tracks are mixed together, with no definitive track boundaries, with ""over the top"" production work, which becomes somewhat annoying. Prince would have been much better off to release these four tracks on an EP, with distinctive silent gaps between the tracks. This would have given all four tracks their distinct individuality, deepening the experience that each track is conveying. On a finishing note, this was one messy album to listen to, with no depth. This was the beginning of Princes' decline"
4,Lame packaging,"In case you don't know, all the songs are on ONE track. That's fine if you have 45 minutes to sit down for a ""spiritual"" experience, but what if you just want to load up the CD changer and shuffle your Prince CDs? You'll have to leave this one out. What if you just want to hear Dance On? It's a good CD other than being on one track. It also isn't one of his here's-another-CD-to-get-me-out-of-my-Warner-Brothers-contract CDs."
3,"Great sounds, Great jams, annoying CD","Love this record. Sheila E's drumkit work, small horn section, great jams all over. BUT, the CD was mastered as one long track. That's right, no easy way to get to track 10 if that's what you wanna hear. And forget shuffling. Prince made it so you must listen to the whole thing, in proper order or not at all,"
4,Lovesexy,"Fast shipping. Prouct arrived within a couple of days of ordering. The CD was in great condition. It included artwork. The case was a little damaged, but what do you expect when something is used. Overall I am satisfied. I love this CD and now I can listen to it whenever I want."
3,The Not-Black Album,"Rushed out when the Black Album was yanked, this album quenched our thirst for new Prince, but hasn't held up extremely well. ""Eye Know"" is a neat sing-along, ""Alphabet St."" is a good jam, and ""Anna Stesia"" is an intriguing sex/religion mix. The rest of the album is serviceable but not really memorable. Prince hasn't put out a bad album yet, but this album may be my least favorite."
3,ilovethisalbum,"""Lovesexy"" will not satisfy the casual Prince fan. I purchase this album as a kid and never quite got the content of it. I'm older now and I rediscovered it a few years ago. I think that it's one of Prince's best albums. I respect him as an artist and the risk of producing non-radio material. I showcased his skills as a musician and how he always challenged himself to move in unfamiliar territory. It also further has fascination with the blurring lines of spirituality and sexuality. It also includes one of his funkiest tunes ever, ""Alphabet Street."" I think that ""Alphabet Street"" is down right dirty and funky. I love it! The title cut is also great and ""Glam Slam"" is a tune that you'll grow to love. ""Lovesexy"" is a must-have for all Prince fans."
3,Pot Metal,"The deep socket is OK and worked well in taking out the upper oxygen sensor in my Maxima. The small crow foot socket, however, broke when I applied torque to the 3/8"" breaker bar that I was using with it. The break occured where the breaker bar attached to the socket. The metal at the break point looked like it was cast metal versus a socket being made from steel."
1,"Junk, don't bother.","This product comes with a warning to wear saftey goggles and they mean it! Only seconds after affixing this tool to my 02 sensor, it shattered to pieces. It took only one tug to break this 02 sensor socket. Disappointing, and I'll have to find something else in order to complete my 02 sensor replacement.Based on this experience, I'll have to say that if you're the type that demands quality tools, as I am, look elsewhere.***update: I purchased a bluepoint unit. It works very well."
4,Rent it for free,"I bought a BOSCH o2 sensor and considered buying this socket set. I had to remove the downstream o2 sensor when I upgraded by cat and exhaust system. It was tough getting the o2 sensor off but was able to remove it with and open wrench. But that was with the cat already removed from the car.I thought the upstream sesnor would be much much more of a challenge and that this socket set would help. (it did)I ended up not getting this socket set and went to AutoZone. They will ""rent"" it to you for free. Basically, you pay for the cost of the sockets and when you're done, you can return it and get a refund. The socket did make it much easier to remove. So it is worth having, regardless of where you get it from."
4,OEM 27110 Oxygen Sensor Socket,"Arrived fast. I wish I had known it was only 3/8"" drive, It would be better to have 1/2"" drive (some O2 sensors are pretty stubborn to take out!). I haven't had a chance to try and see how they hold up yet. Looks like a decent product, with different choices for certain applications, for the price."
3,"Nice, but you get what you pay for","Always wanted one when I was young, so finally having one was amazing! No backing but still usable. It got to me fairly quickly."
5,GOT A RADAR SPEEDING TICKET? THEN BUY THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!!,"It is obvious that the safety nannies and police officers have given this book zero stars, since they like to see people get ticketed. The more tickets that are issued the more $$$ flows in their direction. If you want to have your speeding ticket dismissed or humilate the cop in court, then BUY THIS BOOK! It's got lots of questions to ask the cop and it's really easy to understand. I bought this book based on the recommendations of the other reviews and boy am I glad I did! I got my ticket thrown out of court and I made the cop look like an idiot in court. He didn't know anything about how his radar works. Anyway, BUY THIS BOOK and you'll get your ticket dismissed too!!"
3,HELPFUL BUT YOU NEED TO BE A LAWYER TO UNDERSTAND IT,"Overall, I liked the book, but feel it was very technical in the information presented. There are lots of technical things talked about that are confusing and difficuilt to understand. The book prepares you for court, however, from my experience, you usually dont get much time from the courts to present the case. Most of my experiences in court have the court rushing things along and they did not allow sufficient time to question the officer. I have been lucky in beating my tickets because the police officer did not show up, and our state law helped me out also because the officer did not have calibration records and Connecticut requires the police to have them. Beating the Radar Rap is worth the money spent though, just be prepared to read a book of scientific mumbo jumbo."
3,"Good, but incomplete","I found this book contained relevant information concerning how to fight a radar-based speeding ticket. However, my ticket was laser based. Hmmm, this book was published before laser was even in use. Oh well...I have found it very difficult finding any book on how to fight a laser-based ticket. Any suggestions?"
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!!!,I have had two people show up in court with this book challenging tickets I wrote them. They lost. This book is a joke. The only way this book works is if the judge is fooled by the double talk. Here is a suggestion: SLOW DOWN!!!By the way in the state of Washington extensive training in use of radar is required before you can even use it. So many of the arguments given in this book are moot in this state.
1,"If you order the pizza, you must get beer.",I read the book at Pizza hut. The more pizza and beer I consumered the better the book got.
1,NO REVIEW,I JUST WANT LET BRANDY KNOW I LIKE HER SONG THAT IS HAVE YOU EVER. BECAUSE I LIKE THE BEAT TO IT AND I LIKE HER SONG THE BOY IS MINE IS MINE BECAUSE ME -N- MY COUSIN SING BOTH SONGS.
4,Buy It!,Just Go And Buy The CD!I am listening to it for the first time right now....I Just bought mine!
5,5* but buy the other release with this LP,"This is one of the greatest country rock LP of all time, but just dont buy it, there is another release of this LP with their LP ""Too stuffed to jump"" together holding 74 minutes of one of the best bands in the 70's. So go for the other release, and see my review there."
2,Filled with coding errors,This book contains very good examples and is easy to follow. It would be even easier to follow if I wasn't having to continuously correct coding errors throughout the book. If you want to beef up on your debugging skills then this book is great. I am a little disappointed in the author and his quality control in publishing this book. It would be a fabulous book otherwise.
3,beg to differ,"well, i dont mind the missing cd-rom coz i found the fla files online.ok: so i am a beginner, and i needed a book that would get me running on actionscript. well, this book certainly dispelled my fears about actionscript and i can now read actionscript with fair understanding.but where this book fails is when it rushes to explain actionscript CONCEPTs by giving code and devoting a paltry line or two to explain it. sure, i understand that there is a definite time constraint when trying to teach something quickly, but not this fast!!its pretty good uptil hour 8-9, and after that its jerky. inadequate explanations, and ""type this and understand what it means"" advise.but on the positive side, ALL the examples are real world and often used. u will quickly come up to speed with scrolling, menus, buttons etc. but..... the concept itself? dunno."
2,this book is not very good,"I bought this book 3 months ago and after reading it and playing along with the programming, I found myself very confused about simple things that I learned in the first chapter of 'Foundation Actionscript for Flash MX 2004,' by Sham Bhangal.'Foundation Actionscript for Flash MX 2004' is a MUCH better learning tool than 'Sams...' After reading both books, I would NOT recommend buying 'Sams...''Foundation...' gives the reader a strong foundation in understanding the framework of actionscript (going into details about the use of variables, arrays, and functions right away), but 'Sams...' focuses on making flashy, but underexplained flash files.I made some neat flash files using the 'Sams...' book, and it didnt hurt to read it, but after comparing it to 'Foundation...' I wish I would have bought 'Foundation Actionscript for Flash MX 2004' first."
2,"Decent, but super strong and acidic","You have to cut this down with Sprite Zero or water (Sprite Zero preferably), because it's SO strong - super limey and acidic. Better than the Finest Call Carb conscious (which has sugar alcohol in it and makes you feel kinda sick), but not better tasting."
1,Good thought...poor execution.,"In principle a Splenda Margarita mix sounded like a great idea. The execution was terrible. I poured both of my two bottles down the drain. You would have to be pretty desparate, or otherwise never have had a decent margarita if this was your choice. I would rather skip altogether, as one of the other reviewers had suggested as well. The market has a long way to go to support less sugar in drinks."
1,Baja Bob's Drink Mixes - DON'T BOTHER,"I would be the first to applaud these products if they were good. Unfortunately, I would rather give up drinking that have to drink this tasteless slop. There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable. I poured the mix out. The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out. I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first. BIG MISTAKE! I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund. You will also note that on their web site's ""fan club"" page, there are 0 entries. Save your money unless you are totally desperate. You'd be better off using Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit. Now, that tastes pretty good mixed with Vodka."
4,An Excellent Margarita,"This product makes an excellent Margarita without all the sugar and carbs in normal mixes. Drawback is the cost. Other good Margarita mixes can be had for half the price at your local stores. However if the cost is not a drawback, you can't go wrong. I would easily give it 5 stars if it was priced more reasonably."
2,"scientific, unfortunately not amusing","Although the book's jacket cites a lot of flattering comments like ""fascinating"" and ""to our pleasure, amusement ..."" - unfortunately this is simply not true. The book is - for the average reader - overly scientific, dry and boring."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I wanted to read this book because the topic of a older woman and a younger man intrigued me. However, this author blew the whole story. The ending was horrible and predictable..her writing style is horrible. She writes with so many short sentences and it's almost like you don't know who's speaking at the moment or if she's thinking. I do not know what the other reviewers were reading, but their either paid relatives or friends. This book was BAD! The boy was way too mature for his age and the characters didn't touch me at all. 2 thumbs down!!"
3,much older?,"I picked this book up when I wanted a nice and light book to see me through a night when I had nothing else planned. And it served my purpose well. It was a love story, and I enjoyed it but not for the theme of a much younger man. That's because I found that the character of Tom was not at all convincingly a teenager - except perhaps in the very first scene. He could very well have been the same age as Aly, except then there wouldn't be anything more than a light romance novel. Just what I was after - and just what it was easily read as. The younger man stuff was fluff. Fluff on fluff - one level is enough!"
2,Not worth it!!,"John Tesh has done some good music in the past. This CD is not one of them. The CD tries to introduce new and obscur talent into the business. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a diamond in this rough ride. The only good thing on this CD is the smooth sax on the remake of Kenny Loggins' ""Love Will Follow"". After that, I just want to turn everything off. Don't bother buying."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this book thinking that it would take off where the Wrox books left off (since it is a MS product), but I was very disappointed to find that not only is this book very small (which means it cannot cover the breadth of the .NET framework), it is not much more than a bunch of MSDN articles and reprints of the help & readme files from beta 1.I expected a lot more since MSDN magazine touted these books as a good technical resource.If you're looking for an in-depth resource for .NET, stick with the Wrox books for now."
2,Similegeddon,"I gave this two stars because I could get far enough into it really judge the book on it's merits. I simply found the style of prose to be unbearable. I agree with the one poster who says the writer tries to hard and seems to be saying ""look at my stuff"" (which isn't that great). ""Creamy glow of headlights"" and that sort of thing, such as one would expect in a student lit quarterly or something. For a western themed book that is much more daring,unique and successful I recommend Brain Hall's ""I should be Extremely Happy in Your Company.""Matt"
2,Had to put it down,"Murkoff is an ok writer, but everything is too precious. He's got some dark characters and a little rough subject matter, but this book tries too hard. Too many perfect descriptions and metaphors. I feel like he's trying to impress instead of creating something from the heart. I got about halfway through and I had put it down before I puked. Too bad I didn't get to the dam part, but oh well, must look after my health."
2,Emperor Unclad,"This is by far the least compelling album released by the Heads. Relative to their lofty standards, this is dull, downbeat, repetitious music. Although Byrne has shed the most of the affected naivete of Little Creatures and True Stories, he can't recapture the dark, quirky humor underlying the Heads' best albums, Fear of Music and Remain in Light. And in spite of the heavy beats, there's not much to dance to on this record. Look to Speaking in Tongues or Stop Making Sense for that. It's hard to lament the breakup of this great band after such a lackluster effort."
1,Fear of THIS Music,"So what happened? Many reviewers here have offered their pet theories as to why this Talking Heads recording is good or bad. You will see that few take the middle road, nor can I.Certainly, any band has the right to take any direction its wishes, and on this CD, the freefall that started with True Stories and Little Creatures ends in an all out burn out. The songs are, for the most part, cloying and annoying, and the band's preoccupation with trying to synthesize disparate elements of ""world"" music leaves me cold. Basically, this CD foreshadows the direction of Byrne's solo career, which is not a direction most core Talking Heads fans cared to follow.I suppose there is a place for music like this. I call it the trashcan. It's rarely a good sign when the used CDs start at under five bucks, is it?"
1,I did not like this one.,"I think the Talking Heads are a very original band. I enjoy much of what they have composed, but I do not like this CD. I ended up selling it at a used CD store."
1,No doubt this is what drew the line!!,"Very much a disappointment! Especially for those of you who were deticated fans to the Talking Heads throughout the late 70's and 80's. The first three tracks were okay, I guess or better yey I should say TOLERABLE. Tracks 4 through 10 on the other hand ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Like fingernails on a black board and it's sad because those of you who could dance to classic hits such as ""burning down the house"" that listened to this album know there's nothing you can dance to, or really even upbeat for that matter. It was an unfortunately exhausted effort by who even by 1988 was a worn out band. Why do you think later by the following year maybe 1990 they broke up?"
3,The name of this band is Talking Heads?,"Nope...I don't see it. Somewhere in all of this, there might be a band called 'Talking Heads', but this is so massively overproduced that you might not know. I know that when I heard ""...Flowers"" for the first time, _I_ didn't connect that track with the band, save for David Byrne's distinctive voice being out in front. I can't say this is a bad album, really, but it's not up there with what came before, to be sure. As pop records go, it's good...but also as pop records go, it's somewhat easy to dismiss. Supposedly, this was much more of a 'group effort' than some previous releases, but it appears to have come from a group which had run out of things to say across the course of a very rich and complex career. what came before is so much more rewarding...so go there. Come here last to see how the story ends, if you like, but I wouldn't call this 'essential T-Heads' material by any means."
4,Valuable Work,"Calkin's Final Bivouac is a valuable work that details the uneasy days immediately following Lee's debacle at Sailor's Creek and surrender at Appomattox. The Federal Armies encamped at historic Burkeville, Va preparing to invade North Carolina but with Johnston's surrender marched to Washington for a great victory parade. A good work that fills a gap in history."
4,Bostich goes to work,"I have owned this brad nailer for the past year and half and have had no problems. I have only used it on soft wood so I can't say much for how it will hold out on hard wood. Everyonce in a while I will have a problem getting the nail to set completely in the wood, but more than likely that is an air pressure problem. I would recommend this nailer for use on any soft wood project, I have been satisified but now blown away by its performance."
1,This horn is a cheap toy or tacky wall decoration!,"I was totally disappointed in this product. I guess I should not have expected more for the price. Very flimsy and poorly made, sounds more like buzzing through a paper towel tube than a fanfare trumpet. This will spend the rest of its life hanging on my wall, or as a funnel to add transmission fluid to my truck."
1,"Amy Bento, Advanced Step Challenge","I'm VERY dissapointed with the quality of the DVD. If you ask me, it's a COPY and not an original.I'm using this on a LED TV and the quality/clarity is extremely poor."
1,Do not buy,"This copy contains numerous typos, terrible formatting, no footnotes, chapter titles--it is all but unreadable. I ordered this for a class I'm taking and had to buy a wholly new copy. Avoid this at all costs, DO NOT BE FOOLED."
5,Billy Season 1,Bought this for my oldest for Christmas and he was so excited he could now watch Billy anytime he wanted to. Love this DVD and can't wait to get Season 2
4,Original,"Great original concept. this season is by far their best. Billy carries the show by far. most of the chara ters are pretty obvious that their lines are rehearsed, but Billy is a natural. Your family will love this show."
1,NOt that helpful or original,And I payed money for it! That wasn't very frugal! I'm afraid the solutions offered in this book weren't much more than what most people can think of by themselves.
4,vogue felting,"Cute little book. While some of the items aren't anything I would be interested in, The item I have made had easy to follow instructions."
2,Only one pattern to use,"Could only find one pattern I wanted to knit and felt from this book...as usual, Vogue is too avant-garde...don't waste your money buying this book."
2,Cheap & Portable,"Sounds like an AM transister radio, but for twenty bucks it is worth tossing in the suitcase for listening to my iPod Nano as I nod off in a hotel or a spare bedroom. Unfortunately, the LED power indicator light is bright blue and puts off too much light in a dark bedroom. The design and quality are pretty good and the 3 AA batteries seem to last a long time, but it does not charge the iPod so you'll have to carry a power adapter too.You will probably be satisfied if you are willing to accept mediocre sound quality in order to get very portable and very inexpensive iPod Nano speakers."
5,Authentic bluegrass,"Not slick. Not overproduced. Just authentic homegrown bluegrass in the best tradition of mountain music. The CD (at least the one I have) contains a jam-packed 21 tracks. The artists' proceeds all go to the American Cancer Society in honor of their friend, National Fiddle Champion Randy Howard who lends his talents to many of the tracks. Sadly, Randy lost his battle with cancer in 1999 at the young age of 38.Favorite tracks:1. Old Roads2. Dear Mama3. The Reckoning Time4. Daddy's Swimming Hole5. Southern Skies"
3,Sort of disaponting,"I loved all of the old alk3 stuff. It seemed more to the heart and a little harder. This CD sort of disaponted me even though I was only a short time fan. Some of the song on this CD are good though don't get me wrong. Stupid kid is a really good song and so are some others. But the album in general wasn't what I expected from the same band that sang ""for your lungs only"". I guess after member changes and how music evolves there music changed. In my opinion it wasn't for the better."
5,Love it,I love just about every Alkaline Trio album out there and this one is no exception. I still listen to them on a regular basis and love Keep 'Em Coming and Tuck Me In from this album.
4,Alkaline Trio's worst. But still an awesome CD.,"I'm one of Alkaline Trio's biggest fans. Their 3 full length albums proceeding this are in my top 5, but this one just rubbed me the wrong way. While there are some great songs on this CD like ""Private eye"", ""Armageddon"" and ""I'm dying tomorrow"", It just fails to achieve the lasting impression that their previous albums have, especially ""Goddamnit!"" (which, after owning for over two years, I still listen to weekly). Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad album, it just isn't much after their totally amazing firsts. word of advice: if you haven't purchased any Alkaline trio yet, save this one for last."
4,Not their best,"While it is not their best it's still head and shoulders above most albums. the thing is they got a new drummer in mike felumlee and also Jerry Finn the unfortunate mastermind producer behind Blink's latest albums as well as Sum 41, nfg and so and so forth. It basically took the trio into more of a pop sound which isnt bad but it does sound a little too glossy even though their are some awesome songs on here. Also the label change to Vagrant hurt their raw sound. Danny gets 4 songs on this album and he pretty much steals the show. Best tracks: ""mr. chainsaw"", ""take lots with alcohol"", ""another innocent girl"" , ""trucks and trains"" and ""crawl"""
3,too much filler,"To start off, I'm not one of those people who think Alkaline Trio sold out on 'From Here to Infirmary' - ok the album probably soundsva bit too refined but to be honest the band always had a pop music side to them. The reason I've given the album three stars is there's just too much filler here: many of the songs just sound tossed off and probably were. There are some really great songs here: espescially Crawl, Steamer Trunk an Private Eye, but this remains the only trio album where many of the songs just don't meet their high standards."
4,classic,"first off, anyone who goes track for track and rates them all a 4 or 5 is obviously a fan who doesn't have an objective opinion. just take it with a grain. second, take lots with alcohol and I'm dying tomorrow are two of the best songs on an album that is solid all the way through. If you are new to alkaline, listen to everything but maybe I'll catch fire, as it's their weakest. there is no point in their progression (inculding crimson) that isn't amazing. This is not pop punk, this is great song writing"
2,this disc was sorta a let-down,"Dont get me wrong, Im a huge AK3 fan, and I was really excited about the release of this CD because the others were so great. I got this the day it came out and even got to go to an instore, acoustic show of their's the day it came out. The show was amazing, but when I put in the CD when I got home, I was disapointed. The first song really stands out from the others because its the only one that has a different riff than the others. All the songs on this disc sound exactly the same. Its very repetitive. If you want to hear good AK3, then buy ""Maybe I'll Catch Fire"", its amazing- definetly 5 stars. Oh well, I'm still a huge AK3 fan, and I always will be. Thanks for all the great music."
4,From the case to the Disc Player,"Well, Alkaline trio was a band I never heard of until my friend got this for me for my B Day... Ever since this i heard this CD, I have been hooked on Alkaline Trio.. This CD is great, my personal favorite song is Private Eye, because its damn catchy... If you like dark moody punk music like AFI You may like this... Just a little toned down compared to AFI..."
5,Love My Birkie's,"I had bursitis in the hip, 3 degenerative discs in my lower back, and a sciatic nerve plus was overweight by 100 pounds. I could barely walk and when I did I was using a cane. Medically I was a walking mess! I bought my first pair of Birkie's and I was hooked. They were the ONLY shoes I could wear that took all the strain off of my back & helped my sciatic nerve. I bought several more pairs and this particular style just to modernize my wardrobe. LOVE THEM! They do not look like ""orthopedic-type"" shoes they are very fashion forward and the ""IT"" sandal for the summer months. So they are very functional & very fashionable. Buy them they are a wonderful style and much better than flip-flops."
3,Think it runs big,"I ordered based on the size - 39 is US 8. Well, the shoe is at least 2-3 inches too large, and 1-2 inches too wide. I do have slightly wide feet but these are really wide. I'm not sure who said it ran small but I would need maybe a 37 - 38 in this shoe."
3,Not his best!,"I have read nearly every thing that James Lee Burke has written. I like and admire his use of descriptive words. This book, however, was not nearly as good as his Dave Robicheaux books. His discriptions were just as poetic, his intensity just as good, but I guess I just didn't like the story as much and couldn't relate to the characters as well as with his other books. But it was an interesting read and if you are a Burke fan, I would recommend this one."
3,Not Up to Burke's Best,"I understand this to be a prequel to the Dave Robicheaux series and it's a good thing that Burke changed to Dave from Iry as a hero of sorts. All Iry and his friend did was drink, drink, drink. He was not a particularly interesting character. That certainly is not the case with Robicheaux."
2,A depressing excursion into Montana nightmares.,"Written more than 30 years ago this novel shows Burke's descriptivewriting bursting with hyperbole. The beautiful Montana sceneryis described in terms so rich as to defy human experience. Thedrunkenness, mental aberrations and senseless violence of ordinarypeople leave a lump in your throat, and an unwillingness ever toventure past the state line. It has a Jack Kerouac magnetism butlacks any positive or redeeming message or insight at the end."
2,It can stay lost,"After pages and pages of descriptive phrases of the flora and fauna from Louisiana to Missoula, Montana we finally arrive. We arrive to endless cigarettes, Camels, Lucky Strikes, roll yer own and pot. This is mostly accompanied by many six packs of beer and booze of various brands. The stench of unwashed bodies and the nasty odors of jails prevails. Tiresome adjectives and adverbial phrases, which were interesting the first ten novels, are now old. You'd think an English professor could pick up some new ones from his students. Who cares about any of these shiftless characters.I, for one, am putting down this book and taking a bath.This not one of Burke's best."
3,Exciting French gangster film with a magnetic Jean Gabin.,"Gabin is an aging gangster who has stolen gold bullion from Orly airport and wants to fence it so he can retire. But a rival gangster has other ideas and the rest of the tale deals with beaucoup double-cross, treachery and a final death-dealing confrontation. The Fox Lorber packaging is misleading--a very young Jeanne Moreau does not have a starring role, only a minor supporting one. However they have atoned for this by releasing a sharp, crystal clear print with new, highly visible sub-titles. Gabin is the star here giving a virile magnetic performance and showing why he was a top star in France for over four decades."
4,Who knew?,"""The Girl From U.N.C.L.E."" can really sing, no joke! Very nice on ballads, but lets out with some Merman-y sass on ""Ten Cents A Dance"". (I think this may be the only version that isn't a self-pitying exercise in nervous breakdown!) A welcome addition to the cabaret genre & let's hope she keeps with it."
4,Sultry Sounds From A TV Favorite,"I was very surprised to learn of this recording, and had a chance to hear a few samples which led me to purchase it.As a fan of Miss Powers from years of TV, who can forget Jennifer Hart of Hart To Hart?This cd shows a side of Stefanie Powers many have no clue of, she can sing! and does it quite well!Most of the tracks are standards and known by many , but Stefanie proves she can still give them a shine or two of her own.I am not saying this cd should have won a Grammy, but it is very good music, and will serve well in a romantic setting , or just taking time to relax and wind down after a long day.Stefanie Powers has many talents and this cd easily will please any fan of hers."
5,On the Same Page sung by Stefanie Powers,"Wonderful album, showcases Stefanie Powers singing a must have for anyone who likes blues/jazz or Stefanie Powers. http://www.amazon.com/On-The-Same-Page/dp/B003BMW4NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1338223709&sr;=8-1[...]; [...]"
2,Her meaning,"This book "" Your guide to the tarot"" does not provide ENOUGH information on each cards translation. She shouldn't use her definitions to define the meaning of the cards, instead should of given a ""traditional"" or ""general"" meaning of each particular cards. This book is NOT helpful for any beginners including me ! Her definition of the cards are also TOO SHORT, not enough interpretation or example is giving on them. I bought this KIT to learn the tarot not to wasted money on junk. SMFH - As for the tarot. The images are lovely and well designed, i give it an A+; but the book is an F-.Now i have to buy another book by another author in order to get an understanding of the tarot . smh"
3,"Artwork = A+, Story = C- ...","The story is just average. The dolls, who are supposedly alive, have no real spark and they fail to capture the reader's heart or emotions. However, the cover art, the illustrations on the inside covers, and the artwork throughout the story are delightful! Buy it for the art. For storyline, stick with The Indian in the Cupboard, The Castle in the Attic, and The Mennyms - they take a similar premise and present it with humor, suspense, and real storytelling skill."
2,DIsappointing Cover,"I absolutely love this book and have since my childhood, but I felt deceived on the binding. Although it says ""hardcover,"" the binding is really more of a thicker paperback. If you're searching for the genuine hardback like I was, keep looking."
5,The Doll People,I am almost through reading this book to my five year-old and she is so enchanted she has already asked to read it again. We will recommend it to everyone we know! It is perfect for any little girl (or boy) between four and twelve. It is completely appropriate and deals with a subject matter that is so charming I enjoyed it as much as she did!
5,Not a disappointment!,"This is another great work from Ann M. Martin, as well as another collaboration. In it, young Annabel Doll joins up with new girl Tiffany to save Annabel's aunt, who has been missing for years! The story is fun and keeps you guessing and going along, and the pictures by Brian Selznick are wonderful. Even though this book is generally for the younger people, I enjoyed it when I was thirteen, and others will too."
4,cute book,"I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas. She started to read it while still on Christmas break, and when I asked her if she liked it, she said yes. I think it's well written and is a very cute idea. I asked my daughter if she had ever thought about what her dolls and animals do when she's not around. I like the book because it led to an interesting discussion and let my daughter use her imagination."
5,My 4th grader LOVED this book!!,I bought this book for my daughter who is in 4th grade and she didn't put it down until she had read the entire book one Saturday evening. She absolutely LOVED it and we had to go get the second book in the series right away. She enjoyed the second one and now I am going to purchase third book (Runaway Doll) for her for Christmas.
5,******THE BEST*****,I think this book is great. It is now my favorite book. I read it in only exactly one week!
5,The Doll People Book,"This is an excellent book with fun and adventure abound. Good reading for people of all ages. My 70 year old Father loved it, so much so I bought him his own copy. A fun read over and over."
5,"Tried the rest, the N80 is the best!","I am a framer who used to use all Senco. Then I switched to Paslode, but they were to high maintenance and we had to much down time on the job. Hitachi was next because some of the guys had them. I tossed them within 6 months, they just couldn't hold up around the jobsite. Their magazines kept bending and caused the nails to get jammed in the magazine. I've been using Stanley-Bostitch framers and staplers since 1996 and have never had any problems whatsoever. They are the lightest and most powerful tools that I have ever used. Something can be said about using tools everyday for four years and not ever having to have them serviced. Buy Bostitch and you will never be sorry."
3,Annoying problems,"I have had this nailer for several years now. It was the first nailer I bought. It has an annoying tendency to shoot double nails if you hold it against the workpiece and pull the trigger. It also tends to have the trigger valve hang open, leaking air so fast that you must stop nailing. Occasionally it will stop leaking if the air line is disconnected and then reconnected. I also have the BT-50 brad tacker and the 1/4"" stapler. The stapler has also had problems with the trigger valve (it appears to be the same valve in all of the nailers). I religiously oil the nailers daily before use, so I do not think lack of oiling is the cause of the problem. I have not been able to find replacements valves at any of the local ""Home Centers"", although o-ring kits seem to be available."
3,O.K.nailer,"This is one of the original light weight nailers. It does a decent job. I had one for several years. It is out classed by many newer nailers from Hitachi , Senco, Paslode and even Bostich. They have more power and less recoil than these older design nailers. They also have less of a chance of double firing on you. Believe me that can be very dangerous. I have the med clinic bills to prove it."
3,"Not bad, considering","I LOVE pina coladas, but haven't been able to drink them in years because of how fattening they are. I tried the Baja Bob's mix and don't find it that bad. There is a bit of a different taste to it, but nothing offensive. I used it with Malibu coconut rum."
1,Worst Drink Mix Ever,"If drink disaster has a taste, this is it. BB pina colada mix was so bad, I thought it was expired. Using Splenda is a bad idea, Bob. If you read these reviews, sCRAP this recipe and if you gotta go sugarless, try stevia, much smoother..."
1,Terrible after-taste,"I had high hopes for this product because I like Splenda & I normally drink diet soda anyway. So I feel like I'm used to the ""after-taste"" that non-diet soda drinkers complain of. Unfortunately it was awful! The first sip was o.k. but by the 3rd, I couldn't take the ""funky"" after-taste anymore & had to throw it out. I may still try another flavor & hope for a different result but I definitely DO NOT recommend the Pina Colada mix!"
4,Strangest Sounds On Earth,"I couldn;t imagine what the rest of the album would contain after hearing NEW YORK, NEW YORK played on a Car Horn Organ, but I wasn't disappointed. Some of the most wonderful sounds coming out of pipes, clay pots, and crystal wine glasses. And the book is a treasure with pictures of the various instruments. What a find for the collector of oddball music!"
2,Times Square Orchestrated,"NPR's Morning Edition caught my attention one morning with a piece of bumper music - a rendition of ""New York, New York"" played entirely on car horns. It was the sound you would get if you could orchestrate Times Square. It was utterly delightful and even got the normally-reserved hosts giggling. A quick search of the NPR site brought me to the title ""Gravikords, Whirlies and Pyrophones."" Now who could resist that?Alas, ""New York, New York"" is one of only two or three cuts on the album that can be listened to in an unaltered state of mind. The rest is, well... experimental as promised and confirms why experimental music is not mainstream.On the other hand, having in your collection a version of ""New York, New York"" played on the car horn organ is worth every penny of the cost."
3,Good product for somebody else,"The hitch seems extremely well constructed, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, except that I can't use it for my truck. 1994 Chevrolet 1500 with a step/hitch bumper. The bottom of the hitch plate on the truck is not flat, not even close. From the pictures I thought this would fit between the supports underneath, but it does not."
5,Sturdy hitch,Seems to be a sturdy hitch. Easy to install. Need to get your own mounting bolts it doesn't come with any
4,great price,A heavy duty hitch with a great price. Bolts not included otherwise it would be a 5 star rating.
2,Outsider not convinced,I have looked at the book as provided on the screen. The information provided does not show me any information to convinced me that I would benefit from purchasing the book.
3,OK for a starter,"This might be OK for someone just starting the mandolin but I was looking for something a bit more comprehensive. I found the ""roadmaps"" very helpful in the Jazz Guitar and Slide Guitar series of these books, but this seemed to be lacking somewhat. The ""K"" patterns for double stops was the part of the book most beneficial to me."
5,MANDOLIN ROAD MAPS,"I HAVE HAD THIS BOOK FOR SOME YEARS NOW, BUT ONLY RECIENTLY COME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS TRYING TO TEACH ME. THE K POSITION IS THE PENTATONIC SCALE AND DUBBEL STOPS, AND COVERS ALMOST ALL LYRICS FOR ALMOST ALL TUNES. VERY USEFUL IN BUILDING LEADS AND UNDERSTANDING LEADS."
4,Excellent Resource,"This is a great resource for anyone who has lost someone close. Section one examines the practical things one must get through: what to expect from funeral homes, who to call, planning service. The second section looks the personal aspects: handling grief, supporting children, and other personal issues. The final section deals with God's promises in crisis. The appendix in the back is worth the book itself, providing a sample memorial service, sample obituary, guidelines for supporting children and a plan to help you prepare your own funeral."
5,Excellent Book for Counselors,This well written book is must for counselors working with students who have special needs. It gives sound practical insights on to develop a plan that works for these students. Thumb ups!
3,"Nice fast read, but not fleshed out","This was my first book by this author and while it starts off very strong (read the sample chapters without being able to stop), it quickly peters out to a less than fantastic ending. Overall, it is worth a read with a number of very interesting alien cultures and abilities, but he Doesn't spend nearly enough time fleshing out the experiences. It feels like the book doesn't quite know what its trying to portray as it progresses, leaving the reader feeling that there should have been something more.Part of this feeling may be the length of the book, which is quite short (I finished it in about 7 hours). Still, for a fun, easy to read little adventure, this book works quite well and I am now curious to try more Resnick stories."
4,Fun Light Reading,This is the second book of Resnick's that I have read. I was not disappointed in the least. The near complete absence of technobabel in his prose is very refreshing in what is essentially a space opera. The story was compelling especially as Lennox progressed through his incarnations. I actually caught myself making time to finish it rather than picking it up when I had a minute to read something recreational. Resnick has one of the most unique styles I have experienced in SF. MHR
3,Incomplete,"Resnick's novel is an interesting and rare world where humans are the dominant force in the galaxy (the Republic) and are able to subjugate many of the alien creatures that abound in the many worlds Xavier is able to visit.The book starts off with an interesting and tense visit to the Fireflies. I like how Xavier takes on their form through radical surgery and tries to infiltrate their culture. The rest of the novel highlights Xavier's continued quest to be like other aliens, becoming increasingly uninterested in ever being a human again.What I found frustrating was how the mystery of the Fireflies was never resolved. The book description made me think that the reader is to find out the reasons behind their strange mysticla practices, and instead we are left hanging. The book shifts too quickly into a story that just doesn't fulfill my expectations. A lot more could have been done with this story."
3,Alittle disappointed.,"If you are able to read my reveiw of the original book. ""Manners"" starring Mr. Do and Mr. Don't, you will understand when I say that although the book's outward condition was actually very good. The difference in the copyright year of 1961 vs 1943 leaves alot to be desired as far as the quality of the pictures. The newer copies/reprints have destroyed the original claytoon depictions of the characters. Almost like the picture was recopied over a copy. What you might see if you had double vision. Of course, the story is darling. But, for me, the pictures really 'dulled"" my imagination. I would encourage you to purchase an earlier copyright. ie; 1941,1943."
3,gold panning equipment,"not a bad start for those that want to dig into the idea ofpanning, offers easy steps and ideas to the prospect"
4,"Good, But As Usual, Maxxxi Gets It Wrong....",".....the Top 20 Jam from this was ""Dinner For Two"". ""Quickness"" and ""Thinking About You"" were played consistently on my side of the hemisphere....Jay King actually allowed Cooper to do his solo thing. Let's get the facts a little straight. At least read the liner notes...."
2,Great smell but faulty nozzle,"This is the best smell!!, and it wipes out odors for sure, but after just a few sprays the nozzle stopped working correctly. Ever since then I have had to take the little gray nozzle off and put it back on each and every time I want to spray the spray. So annoying. Will keep me from buying it again."
2,No Mar tips,"Element works fine. Tips shatter in temperatures below 40F. Paslode has no knowledge of any problems and request parts be shipped back to factory. Replacement tips almost impossible to find, even on Internet."
2,should be designed differently!,I had to completely take off the adjustable tip that came with the Framing Nailer. The screws were then too long and I had to shim it with a make-shift washer. Could have been designed to simply slide onto the end without removing the adjusting mechanism.
1,I thought I was sent the wrong part.,"After carefully checking the part numbers, I realized I had the correct item. Then I had to ask how did such a poorly designed item come from Paslode. The Non-Mar Contact Element doesn't fit the cordless framing nailer using the screws that hold the adjustable Standard Work-Contacing Element on the tool. It appears as though new screws must be purchased, or a shim must be made (see another reviewer's comments). I haven't had a chance to figure out what I will have to do to make this thing work with the Non-Mar Contact Element. Needless to say, Paslode needs to make a correction (include screws with the Non-Mar Contact Element, or redesign the Non-Mar Contact Element so that it can be adjusted without tools like the Standard Work-Contacting Element. Until such a correction is made I would avoid the Non-Mar Contact Element unless you absolutely need it. If you figure out how to make it fit the tool, please let me know."
3,It was great until.........,I had given good results to this gun in an earlier review. It does fire very well when it works.Mine stopped firing over the winter. Yesterday I called Bostitch to order an o-ring kit. It is not available. You must purchase o-rings individually. There are over a dozen o-rings in this gun.I then decided to disassemble the gun and troubleshoot the problem. Everything looked good until I took the trigger switch apart. An internal ring had lots of slp in it and did not appear to seal as it should. I was able to buy an o-ring from my lumer yard for $.20 and it fixed the problem.The gun fires as it did when I first purchased it.Beware.......it will cost a minimum of... for a repair center to check this tool and then they will also have to order individual o-rings for it. Maybe Bostitch can fix this soon.
2,STAY AWAY !,"Leaky O-rings after minimal use. Parts are darn near imppossible to get. I won't make this mistake again, time for a Senco ! On the plus side- nice design when it works."
5,Image Stabilization is amazing!,"These are incredible, albeit a bit heavy, binocs, and the IS is impressive. Focus wheel is better/smoother than the more expensive Swarovski binocs. To mine, I've added Nikon's lens caps, B+W metal hoods and and XS-Pro UV filters, and a Comptech strap. Note the lens caps work w/ the filters, but not the hoods, which I remove for storage anyway."
4,Working well so far,I've been running the Lasko 1128 with this filter for the last 4 months (24x7 on low) and looks like I may be able to use this one filter for the entire season.I've been using regular tap water and have occasionally addedBestAir 246 Golden Solution II Combination Water & Bacteriostatic Treatment 64 oz.. I've cleaned the unit about once every 3 weeks and rotated the filter once (so I haven't been that good about regular maintenance as they recommend cleaning once a week).There do seem to be some brown spots (rust?) appearing that I don't remember from before but they seem to wipe off without an issue. It could also be the water additive and not the filter as this is the first time I've used the additive.Bottom line: I'll buy this filter again.
4,Works well,The filters work well with my humidifier. Plan on buying and using two per season (winter time where I live).
5,Humidifier Filter,Very happy with these humidifier filters. Saved me from traveling 50 miles to the nearest store I could purchase them from. They work fine with the humidifier also.
2,2 Thumbs DOWN,"I bought this for my Lasko Model 1128 Humidifier. It is the right size & fitsHenceforth, I'll buy ONLY OEM filters for TWO reasonsPRICE: This filter cost me $15.95 (filter + S&H;) - - OEM filters cost $5.95WATER HOLDING: This filter holds 13.5 oz of water when wet & not dripping. OEM filters hold 16.25 oz of water when wet & not drippingI""m assuming the more water a filter holds the more moisture any humidifier will put out."
5,A must-have for anyone interested in Acadia Nat'l Park,"For many tourists, the hardest part about going on vacations is finding your way through the tourist traps and tacky souvenir shops to get to the real beauty of your destination. Jay Kaiser's book provides a step by step guide to find all the natural beauty and genuine atmosphere of Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park in his book, Acadia Revealed. If you are like me, and immerse yourself in the history and stories that surround a place before you actually visit, this book is a gem. Mr. Kaiser's easy style of writing and colorful descriptions bring each destination to life. His handy maps and insightful pointers make sure that you know what to do and where to go to get the most out of your trip to Acadia. Simply put - don't visit the island without first visiting this book!"
4,Excellent book but...,"Great insights and practicle information. Written by a psychology professor who gives short stories about people who have gone through the problem of job loss. The only problem is that he has never experienced the problem as far as I can tell. I also read A Guide to Coping with Job Loss for Smarties:the emotional aspects of job loss and found it more beneficial. It was written by someone who has first hand experience at getting laid off. He was laid off, I think six times in over 20 years. He also got a lot of information from his web site that has a discussion group on it about other people. www.joblayoffsupport.com. It made me think a lot. Some info is technical but understandable with examples."
5,Absolute Cracker,"I would urge any fan of great mid 60's + music to get this. There's enough of their earlier sound to appeal to the mod/soul crowd but this cd shows the band moving off into their own zone away from the soul covers they did so well. Play it from start to finish and you'll want to put it on again straight away and then go tell all your mates. The demo-ish feel of the tracks adds to the experience and it must rank as one of the great mysteries why a ""proper"" recording was never done and put out. Singer Reg King has sadly recently passed away and it would be nice if The Action were finally given a bit of recognition for the great band they truly were. RIP Reg and Mike."
5,This is a melodic and rhythmic feast for all listeners.,"This CD is a live recording of three melodies. Amjad Ali Khan is at his best here with the flirtatious yet melancolic sentiments of the Ragini Pilu and a thunderous rhythmic exploration in the Raga Kirwani. Beautiful and skillful accompaniment by Zakir Hussain makes this recording a must for all listeners. The final item is a string of melodies known as a raga mala in which Amjad Ali Khan connects several ragas together in a seamless fashion. Khansahib starts with Khammaj and effortlessly weaves Hamsadhwani, Durga, Bhopali, and a few other ragas into a complete musical landscape. He finishes with Zakirji in a display of rhythmic and melodic virtuosity of the highest order."
1,Trash lid is a faulty design,"I bought mine at Target on sale for $79.99. Had the same problem as the other reviewer. After about 2 days of use, the lid stopped closing. Basically, the latch piece is only held on to the lid by glue which easily wears out. The same problem occurs with the spring load bracket. The glue holding the bracket wears out and the spring loaded lid stops opening as wide.The garbage can size proportions are odd also, it very narrow and tall. You have to use the extra tall garbage bags which we didn't have (and didn't want to buy)."
1,Poor design -Garbage lid lasted 10 minutes,"The Rival Shredder/Garbage can is a great idea. Sadly, the garbage lid is a spring loaded flip up design that failed after opening and closing the lid 5-6 times. I purchased mine at Circuit City for 79.99, and returned it 20 minutes. later I did have a bit of fun watching the store clerk try to successfully close the garbage lid, only to have it flip back up in his face.Shredder portion was okay, but I couldn't get 7 folded pages to go through. The opening is also 5"" wide, so paper must be folded the long way."
5,Beautiful!!!,"This is Jerry Ricks's second CD, cut three years after his first (DEEP IN THE WELL). He is a master of the acoustic guitar and his blues relect the use of that instrument. He has roots deep in the pre-war blues scene. Whether reviving works by masters such as Mississippi John Hurt (LOUIS COLLINS), Buddy Moss (UNDERTAKER BLUES), or Ed Bell (ONE MORE TIME) or offering up his own compositions (MISSOURI RIVER BLUES), Ricks has both feet well-planted in the blues tradition.He sings in a rich, deep baritone voice that's mellow and captivating (he sounds a lot like Chris Smither). Ricks is a superb artist and he asks us to share in his artistry by not only digging the words but by noticing the subtle, brilliant guitar work going on as well. It's the kind of stuff you can listen to all day and never get tired of. An excellent CD. A must-have for acoustic blues fans."
1,Ok,"I found this book very interesting until I got to the synopsis of the Lord of the Rings. I found four mistakes! 1 - Mike says that Legolas, Gimli, AND Aragorn are in a boat 2gether going down the Anduin and Frodo and Sam are alone. Wrong. Aragorn is with the 2 hobbits. 2 - It mentions that Frodo is wounded in battle and captured by Orcs. Wrong again, he was wounded by a spider. 3 - The guy totally skips over when Aragorn is crowned! That is half of the point of ROTK! 4 - Lotho Simple? Where did he get that? It's Lotho Sackville-Baggins! I am quite irritated with this book! I now have no idea if half the facts are even true! Tiis is an easy read, but Mike sure didn't read LOTR! And, I KNOW some of the other facts aren't true...I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who hasn't read LOTR at all, because the synopsis is totally wrong. I really wanted to learn something about JRRT, but I learned something else - Mike doesn't know what he's talking about."
4,A good introduction for adults too.,"Although ""JRR - The Man Who Created ..."" was aimed at young adults, I found it a good introduction for me as an older adult. It can be read in an evening, but I believe that it touches on all the main points. True, it does not go into the scholarly quarrels and quibbles or the lit crit, but I did not need that. I really just needed to know what type of a person Tolkien was. The book serves that purpose admirably. If I were cataloguing for a library, I would put one in the adult section too."
2,Leo Dan,"Uno espera mas, como un concierto entero. Y estoy seguro que lo hay. No quede satisfecho con video clips que se puede bajar de YOUTUBE"
3,Dawn of a new genre?,"This delightful trio of films concentrate on the gay experiences of their characters. The films (each by a different contributor) represent the gamut from gay bashing, where the tables are unexpectedly turned, to fantasy with an unusual sprinkling of love and lust thrown in for good measure. Fills a niche in the popular gay oriented cinema. Enjoyable and different."
2,Artsy-Fartsy,"I usually like this films that no one else likes, but this collection just sucked. All the acting was terrible. The only short that was worth it was that last one. It actually had a story and some cute characters. The others were just stupid. They were the kind of stories that only happen to people in short films like these.Also, they didn't have very cute actors. I mean, if you're gonna have bad acting and stupid stories you should at least have some cute guys without that much clothing on to hold some attention from the audience. The cover of the video is very misleading.I was very disappointed with this collection of short films, except the last one, it was cute. I say get ""Boys' Life"" 1 & 2. Those are far better than this series."
3,Good even for non-fans,"I'm not a particular fan of John Tesh, but I had to own this CD once I heard ""Barcelona.""Most of John Tesh's best works are contained on this CD, so people who are usually bored with his work (like myself) may have a change of heart.The Special Edition is probably best reserved for hard-core John Tesh fans. Those last six tracks were left off the original edition for a reason.Although I'd recommend the original version over the special edition, either won't disappoint even moderate fans of John Tesh."
1,Its Cheeze Whiz,This reminds me of the first time I tasted Cheez Whiz...kinda cheesy...convenient..straight out of the tube..but wait a minute..its always cheeze whiz...no matter how you slice it...John has a great smile and great hair...but I wonder if anything beyond the realm of the triad has ever interested him... This reminds me of my first tasting of cheeze whiz...cheesy..whizzy..and definitely cheezewhizzy....perhaps time to put it back in the tube...and try again when youve figured out some new chords and have some new crackers for the cheeze....thanks john....keep searchin
3,Dog is displeased..,"The product doesn't really have any flaws in its production, I don't think. It's hard to gauge the right size for the dog. My dog quickly pulls them off and they are hard to get on his feet in the first place."
3,"Good, but fabric didn't look durable",I actually ordered a size that was too big and had to send them back unopened (so keep that in mind as you read) but they seemed to be the same fabric as a pair I had purchased for $10 at Petsmart. The ones from Petsmart completely wore through after a few times of light wear and one time of harder use. I considered sending these back for the correct size but decided to get a more high-quality pair instead.These might be better for an older dog who isn't super active and doesn't need extremely durable booties.Fast shipping by the company though!
3,What Size???,"We got a pair of XXSM for our miniature pinscher and they were way too big. They looked like they would fit a cocker spaniel or border collie sized dog. I think these would be a good product, but getting the right size is going to be the problem for most people ordering these online."
1,Poor fabric quality!,After receiving our package a week later than expected we put the booties on and took our dog for a walk around the block in the snow when we got home there were already holes starting in the fabric. Very disappointed!
2,Did Not Stay on,I put these on my Lab and they came off while walking from the livingroom to the kitchen. I thought that they would also provide some traction but the bottoms are plastic like material.. I am returning them.
1,Bad design for little dogs,"Even though these are the smallest size available, they are still too big for our teacup yorkie (3 1/2 lbs). They are also too stiff, they remind me of kids waterproof mittens that don't bend well & make it impossible for them to pick any thing up... basically they slip off our dog or she pulls them off. Maybe if the fabric material on the top of the boots was longer & narrower around the top like a big tube sock they would stay on better.Would not recommend. Any dog who's feet are small enough to fit inside this boot will have too narrow of legs for them to stay on"
4,Seem Alright,"I purchased these in an xxsm for my mini aussie. I haven't decided if I purchased the best size, but they seem alright. My dog isn't very persistent in getting them off, so far we've only had 1 fall off. They're a bit difficult to get on. It could be because they are almost too small, but I measured my dog's foot and they seem to fit once they're on. Getting his foot through the opening without being too rough is a bit of a task. Once they're on and strapped fairly tight, they do the trick. Don't expect them to increase traction on cement or tile. My dog was sliding all over the place with these on."
4,"Perfect for injuries or cold, but hard to keep on!","I have a German Shepherd obsessed with playing fetch, and she recently tore her pads up running on asphalt and very abrasive grass. Since I couldn't get her to stop, even when her feet were bleeding, I put these on her- now she can run and play (and really didn't even seem to mind them that much!) with no limping and no concern about further damage. We had to strap them on so tight I thought it would be painful for her just to make them stay on when she ran, and that makes me nervous, but that's the only way to make them stay on her feet. The velcro has to be cut when they're strapped on because we ended up with about 8 inches of extra strap- not a big deal, but seems excessive. I would purchase this item again, though it seems it has some minor design flaws."
1,Guardian Gear Dog Boots,"I purchased the dog boots for our Doberman because we needed something to cover his paw to prevent him from licking on it for a period of time. The boots do not last, and barely made a week. We do not live in a cold climate where the weather is harsh. The surface the dog was on had grass and a driveway, so the product did not undergo any hard surfaces for an extended period of time. Then I noticed the product is made in China. Enough said. Are there any American products out there for dogs anymore? These boots were not worth the price and do not hold up to the job they were manufactured for. Final opinion- FAIL!"
1,Not as Described,These boots are way too wide and very stiff. Contacted seller and received no response.
1,Ehh,They didn't fit my 5lb toy poodle. Im not sure it they were too big but they flew off as soon as he started running around. They are very stiff and didn't seem comfortable. They were very nice looking tho.
4,History of philosophy for nonmajors,"The history of philosophy is fascinating for the ideas alone, but it is also a continuing debate among various thinkers in many different fields of study (physics, psychology, economics, anthropology...). Donald Palmer tells the story of some major thinkers of the West in simple language and illustrations, and yet manages to avoid treating the reader as a child (though a child could read this book and learn much). He provides a quick overview of Western thought from the early Greeks to twentieth century Poststructuralists for readers who are interested in philosophy but have never encountered it. This is a better introduction than Palmer's ""Does the Center Hold?"" which is organized by topics of philosophy rather than chronologically. However, if you are seriously interested in philosophy, you will want to read more, and he provides a good bibliography with suggestions for primary and secondary sources at the end."
4,Good primer,"I use this textbook as an introductory guide to Philosophy at a small state college. The students like it, and can actually get through it, and yet it is smart, and doesn't dumb down big ideas.This book is just wonderful, and the author even has a sense of humor. From this, we go on to Seinfeld and Philosophy, and finally Cohen's book A Philosophical Approach to Jokes, if that's the right name. Of these, Palmer's book is far and away the most helpful.I wish there was just a little bit more about the importance of these ideas as they are reflected in the polis. For instance, he goes through the ideas of Hobbes but doesn't talk about where they lead, or the social implications of his ideas."
5,Philosophy made easy...,"I bought this book for my Philosophy 101 class. I tried to sell it back but the bookstore wouldn't let me. Although I hated the idea that I wouldn't be getting my 30 bucks back, little did I know that this book would serve as an important tool for my Literary/Criticism class (which I am currently taking). It definitely clarifies complicated theories with a touch of humor added to the descriptions. There are also sketches in the book that are also humorous, yet provide the reader with a mental image on the topic at hand."
5,A wonderful book!,"This is perhaps, the best introductory book on philosophy that exists. Palmer, as usual, presents philosophy in this book in a manner that both explains the underlying assumptions and meanings of philosophy and answers the question, why should we care about philosophy. Any work by Palmer is worth reading."
1,Humor for those easily amused,"I'm driven to write a short negative review by the acclaim this series of books seems to generate. I suppose I'm alone in thinking that in reading a history of philosophy you should aim for unique perspective, erudition, or outlandish insult. I don't think this series of introductions fulfills any of these roles. While finding a general consensus in the rating of philosophical systems is a pipedream not worth pursuing, there are so many alternative histories worth perusing, that I would advise anyone with a modicum of lively interest in the subject to avoid these books. Even if your looking for the comic book variety of ""how to"" manuals, there are better to find. I'm repulsed every time I've browsed this title in the local superchain."
4,unexpected,"Entry Level was a nice surprise. The story is a light, funny look at the world of unemployment along with a bit of romantic comedy. The leads DB Sweeney and Missi Pyle have an easy, unforced style; they are much more endearing than the typical quirky independent characters that push everything in your face. Missi Pyle deserves more acting opportunities like this role. The supporting characters, especially Kurtwood Smith and Taylor Negron, are colorful but not unrealistic. (Sweeney's first encounter with Negron is pretty damn great.) Plenty of good, honest moments between all of these people as they hunt for jobs and vent about resumes or being too old... I loved the discussions on the awesome sandwiches made by Sweeney's character. Whenever someone mentioned an unusual ingredient, I totally got hungry."
2,Worked fine for several months - then started locking up,"As several others here, and elsewhere, have reported - the unit worked fine (great actually) for several months, then started locking up. All LED's lit - reboot and all is ok. Does it once or twice a day, sometimes more often. If I leave for a few days, it will surely be locked up when I return. Have updated to the latest 2.40 firmware - no help."
1,You might want to look at something else,"I have had this unit for about 3 months now. Every so often it locks up (all the lights freeze) and it takes a power cycle to get it working again. One time if froze up and I had to reset back to factory default configuration. Fortunately I had save the configuration a day or two earlier and was able to reload it.Along with the occasional freezing I have noticed internet access problems which I had assumed were with Comcast. I have now discovered that the router quits passing data for about 3-5 seconds every minute or so when it's under load. It doesn't loose the wireless connection, but the data stream stops for several seconds. It appears to be long enough to drop instant messaging connections and file sharing connections."
1,This is the last D-Link product I will ever buy,"Over the course of several calls and emails with D-Link support, I was required to go to extraordinary lengths to prove to them that the problems I was experiencing weren't imaginary. They explained that as a ""home"" router, it was perfectly normal to have to reboot the router every day or two. Finally, they replaced the router, but that didn't solve the problem (I'm convinced this product is fundamentally defective). Then, they charged my credit card $50 because I didn't send back their $1 Ethernet cable. D-Link is a horrible company that needs to go out of business, and I will not spend another dollar with them."
1,Just as bad as every one said,"Great features. No customer support, constant rebooting, endless reconfiguring. After several weeks of useless tech support denying the problems with literal flat out lies, I found an abundance of info on the shortcomings of this device. I install networks and have no lack of ability in this area but the fact is this cheep router cost me a lot of wasted time and money. Now it sits on the shelf in my closet and I use my old linksys. PS if you must use this router and the reboots/drops are killing you turn off ALL the extended features and limit it to A, B, or G, that will help."
1,Beware of warranty,"I just received my dead DI-784 back from D-Link service. They refused to honor the three-year warranty because my paperwork showed that I purchased the unit from an online vendor, not an authorized retailer.Unit worked great until it went bad.Awaiting delivery of my new Netgear WGU624."
2,Not recommended for simultaneous A/G usage,"I've had this router for about 2 years, and am only now just starting to get it working reliably. I had the same issue reported by others with the router locking up after a few minutes (with all the status lights staying on). Customer service was not helpful. I upgraded the firmware, and finally figured out that if I disable the 802.11-a antenna (which i'm no longer using), the router lock-ups went away.So, if you only need it to work with either an 802.11-a or g network, it'll probably work. However, I will not buy D-Link products anymore; they couldn't even figure this bug out, and they designed it."
2,Worked for 3-4 months,"Worked fine for several months, had a few hang ups here and there but nothing I didn't expect from a router.After 3-4 months it started cutting out all the time, I would have to unplug it and wait a minute and then plug it back in, which only made it work for 10-20 minutes until it cut out again. Seems like this model is defective as a lot of other people have experience the same problem. I would pass on this router."
1,Locks up frequently,My intention was to use the router with the Media center extender. But the router frequently locks up. Have to reboot the router frequently. The lock ups are more frequent if you use both the bands simultaneously (A and G).So I now use this router as standby and have shifted my main internet connection to a different router.I feel that it is a waste of money.
1,Strike Two---Locks up,"As has been reported by others (judging by the reviews), this router is on it's way to electronics recycling heaven. The first one I purchased was DOA, and now after a few months, the 2nd is now dead too. Steer clear of this one!"
2,Probable Heat Issue - Agree with other users,"I have had the exact same problem others describe. It started off with a lock-up maybe once every few days, and then became progressively more frequent, until recently when it was locking up every 15-30 minutes.As a last ditch effort, I removed the outer case from the unit so it is sitting with circuit board exposed - have not had a lock-up for 48 hours. That suggests to me a high sensitivity to heat.I decided to replace it rather than wait for it to progress any further. D-Link should probably offer something to users for such a seemingly frequent problem."
2,Very fast but drops me often,"This was easy to install. But whenever I connect my laptop wireless or via a network cable to one of the router ports, it drops and I must disconnect the power cord and reconnect it to get back online. I'm looking for another one to replace this one."
4,Really unique and a Great Value,"Track one and two are out of this world. Mesmerizing and energetic. The many page magazine-like book alone is worth more than the cost of this CD used.If you like unique world music with extensive notes on how the music was produced and why, you will love this CD."
3,Here in the UK......,"back in the late 1980's I saw the video for 'Cold,Cold world'. At a time then (and now) when most black music was about love, sex relationships, it was refreshing to hear a group sing about social issues that affected all of us. From 'Frances' about a girl who gets eaten up by the world, to 'only the strong survive' this is an often slept on album. If you fancy something different give this a try."
5,Blast from the Past!!!,"I actually had the cassette of this CD, but not too many vehicles have cassette players now. Plus, cassettes are easily damaged if not handled correctly or your 4-yr-old granddaughter gets to them. I love my vintage music from the 60's, 70's and 80's! I'm looking to trade in my current vehicle and none of the vehicles I looked at for a trade in have cassette players. :-("
2,Dreadful!,"Don't get me wrong, I'm all for music that is a departure from mainstream junk. Crispy Ambulance employs basic chords and driving beats that have the potential for being good songs but they just dont have the ability to pull it off. The most obvious downside is the horrible vocals. Let's be serious folks, if you're out of key 90% of the time, your music is going to sound like crap. This is one garage band that should have stayed in the garage."
2,"Pleasurable, But He's Repeating Himself","Arto Lindsay's electronica, with its deep Brazilian rhythms and sensuous sheen, has certainly been influential. From his days in the no wave skronk band DNA through his leadership of Ambitious Lovers, Lindsay has always delighted in breaking convention, expanding genre until the term itself is meaningless. He's a true original, nowhere more evident than on his masterful Mundo Civilizado, with a remake of ""Erotic City"" as indelible and odd as Prince's original. Though still a master craftsman, on Invoke you can hear Lindsay repeating himself. There isn't a time during these 12 tracks when you don't think: he's done this better before. Yet there are pleasures. The title track is a true invocation - the resurrection, in images, of a vanished lover. And ""Beija-me"", the simplest number here, is a breezy kiss worthy of Gilberto Gil."
3,Buy American!,"I am a big fan of Stanley air tools and have several of them in my collection. I purchased this stapler sight unseen and expected to see the proud label ""Made in USA"" upon opening the box, sadly I was shocked to see ""Made in Taiwan"" stamp on the stapler. Also, I made the decision to purchase this stapler based on the specs stating that it will shoot 1 1/2"" staples. As of yet, I cannot find any 1 1/2"" staples that will work in this unit. Stanley does not even show a stock number for this size of staple. What's up Stanley? I will buy American Made next time after I get my money back for this import."
3,"Worth the download, not the money!","Yuck! Only a few good songs on this CD makes me want to puke! In my opinion, stick to compilations and promos cause this CD stinks!!!"
1,This CD isn't worth it.,"I made a huge mistake by spending [$$$] on this [junky] CD. I heard the single ""let me love you"" on the radio, and liked it. Since I can't get a hold of that CD single, I have to buy the whole CD. And guess what, ""let me love you"" is the only song on this CD that worth listening. Other tracks made me sick and I don't want to listen to them for the 2nd time.So here are my advices: 1) If you are a die-hard Da Buzz fan that loves every Da Buzz song no matter how bad they sound, by all means get this CD. 2) If you are like me, only like the single ""let me love you"", go buy that CD single, or buy some dance party CDs that has that song in it, believe me, those kind of CD are better this CD. Hope that saved you some money, and don't make the same mistake as I did. I will sell this [garbage] CD in the used CD market asap."
2,Mediocre Pop,"Fun, easy, and sort of melodic. If you have high standards in Pop, and like masters like Abba who wrote such perfect pop melodies, you may not like this though. It is too dancy and bubble gummy. After a few listens, all the songs sound the same and they do not last. If you like Ibiza type music or even Aqua, then give it a try."
1,poor packaging,the product was very good. why i gave it 1 star was the poor packaging and all the broken cookies.
1,WARNING $25+ For One Bag,"After confirming that the receipt of ONE BAG was not an error, I was able to get a partial credit."
2,To Much Hassle,"I bought the Paslode with high expectations, but was rather disappointed with it. Out of the first 50 nails I shot, 1/3 of them jammed. It was also somewhat clumsy and top heavy, not that a hose is not. Didn't bother, just returned it after 1 day. The Porter Cable air nailer I have has been in service for 3 years with never a problem. Considering you could get a nice 2ble Hotdog Contractor compressor and a PC finish nailer for the same price as the Paslode, I would definately stay with air. The compressor will serve you well for other uses as well. Sorry, just can't recommed the Paslode from my experience."
2,customer service,"Living in Los Angeles must be the ""out back"" to Paslode, I purchased the tool with the understanding that nails and fuel cells could be purchased at places like Lowes and Home Depot or at best at local tool outlets. I have yet to find a retailer that sell the 18 guage nail, some do sell brads. I had to have the fuel cell UPS'ed from Oxnard Ca. I went on line and discussed the problem with Paslode. They could care less, they insist that fuel cells and nails are available(but they wouldn't sell me any????. So I continue to call tool supply stores and check larger retailers. The Paslode catalogue ""on line fastener section"" does not even refer to the nails in question. As far as performance, when using brads it works adequatly. So to any and all of you that are considering the purchase of this tool make sure that accessories and supplies are available Would I buy another produce-----NO."
3,an okay nailer,"I was refinishing all of the closets in my house and grew tired of the hammer, smash thumb, bent nail, then have have to set the nail routine so I went to my local Home Depot and rented on these cordless nailers. I was originally going to rent a Bostich angled finish nailer since i already have a compressor but when i got there, they were all rented out! I was bummed at first but i saw this nailer in the corner so i decided to give it a shot. It took some getting used to at first but it proved fairly easy to manuever in my cramped closets. I did like the fact i didnt have to mess with my compressor but i didnt like how large the engine was and it was kinda top heavy. It also seemed to have touble sinking in about 15% of the nails i shot. I dont know if this is how they are or because it was an abused retal. Given the cost id rather have one of those nailer/compressor combos."
2,LIL J,"Well, heres another kiddie rapper. Lil J is a year older than Bow Wow, but that doesnt show in talent! Lil J has a deeper/horser voice that makes all the songs sound the same,and ot gets to be a little too much after a while! But some of these trax are good."
2,Can the examples be any more Confusing???,"This book must have been rushed to market. Normally, I buy a tech book and count the examples to get me through the more complicated material. I find it easier to simply read the code sometimes vs spending my time reading what the author has to say. Well, with Struts Essentials that isn't an option. The examples are horribly confusing.For each sample app the author just used a naming scheme of chapter number and then he adds an incrementing number at the end of the chapter name to get the class/file name.The index page would be ch04_01.jsp. An Action class would be ch04_02.java. A form would be ch04_03.java. And a results jsp page would be ch04_04.jsp.What a bad idea. So then try to imagine learning how to tie the Struts concepts together with writing a struts-config.xml. It's very ugly and so very confusing.Insult to injury, I've found a number or errata but there isn't anywhere on the books site to let the author/publisher know.Buy a different book."
5,The Heart of the Artist speaks to the artist in me,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Noland's 'The Heart of the Artist.' I started reading this as part of our music ministry team. I don't think I've ever realized how my creative, artistic temperment impacted how I lived and worked. I've applied these realizations as much for my business as my ministry. A good read and which ties in the creative with Biblical truths."
5,Superior!,"This book is very helpful for both persons in worship arts leadership and those who are committed to any given team under that heading. It will challenge you spiritually, mentally, and help you grow no matter what your position is in ministry. I recommend this for all persons in or going into worship arts ministry of any kind."
5,Amazing!,"My husband and I run a discipleship school for musicians and this is the second year we have taken our students thru this book. We have also gone through it with our worship team and everyone that has read it says that it has changed their lives. I recommend it to anyone. It is an easy read, with life changing content!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book talks somewhat about art issues, but the main focus is on Biblical character. Most of this material can be found on any book about discipleship. It wasn't specific enough about artistic issues. Furthermore, the author's approach was very simplistic, and did not produce any profound insight that an artist might derive benefit from. It would be good for someone who is a brand new Christian, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,The Heart of the Artist,"Book came in and really should have been described as in less condition than it was. Also, I was told via email to the vendor that this was the 2nd Edition and I received the 1st edition instead. So I didn't get exactly what I paid for. The contents of the book are very good so the book itself gets a good review. However, I the lower rating is due to the misstating of the condition of the used book and because it was not the 2nd edition as promised."
3,Okay,"The arrival time was okay, but the condition of the book did not match the description. There appeared to be some kind of dried liquid stains throughout the book?? Coffee or tea perhaps??"
1,Got to agree with the others...,"This book is lacking in every way. It may have been amazing in 2002 or 2004 when it was put out, but it is now only good for a class in what NOT to do. Most of the images are pretty boring and tame. I felt that a lot of the images were so obvious and expected - stuff you see everyday. Rockport's 1,000 Graphic Elements: Details for Distinctive Designs was much better. At least it had some inspiring images and cutting-edge work. More 3-D stuff, too.Skip this book and check out 1,000 Graphic Elements: Details for Distinctive Designs; it's better."
1,Awwwww...,"This book's content ranges from fair design to absolutely abominable. I'm eighteen and I run circles around most of the designers featured in this book... that's not a good sign. The best design in this book is actually the cover, which can be very decieving... most of the content is flatly uncreative, with all the dullness of a dentist's waiting room. It is, however a good example of what not to do in brochure design: noted mistakes include sloppy collaging (not intentionally sloppy), terrible visual appeal, and the work of designers who went filter-happy in Photoshop (the Emboss filter, no less.) Please avoid this book. Amateurs might enjoy it, but for God's sake, don't emulate the work in it. I realize how arrogant this review may be, but it's hard not to feel that way when your own work puts thiers to shame."
4,Morris Day - Daydreaming...,"The song on this album was ""Fishnet."" Wow! What a funky cut! The rest of the album isn't bad, either! Yes, I'm biased for one song! I rate this effort by Morris Day: 4 stars!"
4,Nostalgic!!,"Morris gets nuts. Its good, but it makes you wish the boys had put out as much work as Prince did. Not definitive, but he doesnt have a whole lot of CDs out there. So... get this."
2,FISHNET WAS THE ONLY SONG I LIKED,THE ONLY SONG I HEARED FROM THIS ALBUM WAS FISHNET AND I SEE WHY. THE REST OF THE ALBUM WAS POORLY DONE.
3,My Review,"A decent album. Although, only two songs where worth listening too, and the rest all sounded similar."
2,Damaged,"I really liked the tripod for my hammock chair, but one of the rings at the on the leg of the tripod arrived broken."
3,Hammaka Tripod Stand,"The hammock is probably ok for the current application intended but I am comparing it to one that I purchased many years ago from the originator of the design which was made in PA. I wanted a spare but the original is at least a foot higher and better quality. Where weleded, I found the welding very sloppy in the current offering."
1,Is this a joke?,"Is this a joke? This album is easily one of the worst I have ever heard. The lyrics are nothing short of embarassing. The vocals sound like a cross between Johnny Cash on a bad day and Bob Dylan (as the Nightwatchman seems to have trouble staying on key). The most suprising part about this album is the guitar work. It sucks. Morello is known for being one of the most innovative guitarists in the last ten years for his work in Audioslave and Rage Against The Machine. But in this album, he relies on basic chords and dated blues riffs. The only conclusion I can reach from this album is that Morello must not have any friends. If he did, they would NEVER let him release this tragically bad album."
1,two thumbs down,horrible. it was painful to even attempt to listen to this album. like others i had high hopes and it didnt even come close. why?
1,Direct from American Idol's worst auditions,"Tom Morello should play this stuff on ameuture night at the Apollo.lol.This is the most horrible ""singing"" I have ever heard.BTW,if you dont like the government you should leave the country.See how much money you would get for being a rock star somewhere else"
5,Right On,"A us citizen who nows his rights and uses them . My respects and my admiration for well written songs that do tell the state of affairs knowingly . Great perspective and needed views . Tell it as It . Up there with Dylan , Guthrie , The Boss , Johnson , etc ... Pass it on ..."
3,Pretty Good,"Overall it's a solid album. Some parts are a little cheesy but most of it's pretty good. I actually think the weakest song on the whole album is the title track ""One Man Revolution"". I think this is an artist that is really going to grow; I look forward to his next album.Weather or not you liked Rage Against the Machine is really no indication of weather you'll like this album. Both were political, but that's really the only common thread. The album reminds me a lot more of Bob Dylan then Rage Against the Machine."
2,Stick with the Whammy pedal Tom.......,"While the concept behind The Nightwatchman certainly has merit, the execution of this album is not up to the same standard. As a fan of Rage Against the Machine, I was interested to see how this would compare. The guitar playing is mediocre, and the vocals are ridiculous. Tom's singing sounds affected and forced. While Zach de la Rocha spit his venom on the Rage albums, Tom is clearly making a profound effort to whisper his. His voice actually doesn't sound that bad when he's singing naturally, it's the amateurish attempt to channel 'Nebraska'-era Springsteen that's laughable. Overall, this was a real disappointment. This pales in comparison with 'Nebraska', 'Ghost of Tom Joad', or any protest music by Neil Young."
1,disappointing,"This album was extremely well hyped, and turned out to be a huge let down. If you loved Rage Against the Machine, then you will probably hate this album. Everything that you have come to love about his guitar playing with Rage is completely missing on this accoustic album. If you like Leonard Cohen then buy this album. If you don't then don't bother. Don't base your purchase upon Rage Against the Machine."
4,"Surprising, considering his history.","I'm into folk protest music, and had to get this album. It was after I purchased it that I found out who Tom Morello is. A guitar player for Rage Against the Machine, and Audioslave. Two of my most hated bands of all time. Honestly, before I heard this, I always assumed ""Alternative Rockers"" were useless and untalented. This album proves that thoery is untrue, although I still hate the style of ""Alternative Rock."" The style of The Nightwatchman is NOT Alternative, but more like old folk music from the 60's.If you don't think about Tom Morello's history, than this album is easier to digest. None of the songs on it are as good as his single ""Alone Without You"" from Sicko, but if you liked that song, then you will like this album. However, if you're a metalhead expecting typical metalhead stuff, then you will hate it considerably."
4,Great CD,"Definitely a change of pace when it comes to Tom Morello's style, but for fans of many different music genres and fans of Tom himself, this is a great album and I would recommend picking it up."
4,decent album,"I thought this was a pretty solid album. The guitar work was nothing new or special, but it isnt meant to be. Tom wasn't going for the innovative sound he had with RATM. this album is more about the lyrics and the message. I feel that the lyrics are above average. You can tell that Tom cares about the issues he sings about, and that he truly has a passion for them. I think the whole point of the album was to get his message and beliefs out there like he never did before. Let's face it, RATM was lyrically Zack's band, and Audioslave definitely did not give Tom the chance to really put his own views out there. This was his chance, and I feel that he made good use of it. I've listened to the album over and over, and each time I find some great lyric that I missed before. I've read many people saying that this album was bad because it didn't sound like Tom's old work. Well imagine that. It wasn't meant to. Get over it."
2,"Love Joe, but the cards are so-so","I LOVE Joseph Campbell and carried a Joseph Campbell Reader around for about 10 years, so thought i'd buy this deck. Unlike the reader, full of brief, elegant, entertaining and accessible vignettes - this deck somehow found a way to include some of the more arduous and obscure quotations. I've tried for many moons to rotate through, but this deck doesn't touch me in the way so many other JC products do."
2,Not much action...,"This book only helped me understand a little more about the A-20 from a purely technical viewpoint. There was very little combat to speak of until one big mission over the Phillipines in 1944. I was expecting some more barge hunting, attacks on sea convoys and such.I've already read enough books on the Pacific war from a variety of campaigns to know about life during the island hopping campaigns and such. So, this book came as quite a disappointment.Not badly written, but not really a lot to sink one's teeth into."
5,An interesting view,"This book does more than talk about flying in combat, it talks about the build up to war, life in the late 1930's in America and then the training process and the many accidents from young men showing off. His descriptions of combat are there, but not the strongest point.Given that there are few other books that describe combat in the A-20, this is a valuable book for that alone. I could ask the author a zillion more questions, but this was a pleasant easy read that brought back my father's stories of Pre-WW2 and gives you a feel for life in the front lines of combat/attack aircraft. Heavy on background but a little light on tactics, combat and technical aspects."
2,An unexamined life,"The author has given us the shallowest of memoirs on his experiences as an Army Air Force pilot in the SW Pacific flying A-20G Havocs during the period July 1944-April 1945. There are lots of details about the aircraft but no sense of the man, his inner life or the emotional and physical price he paid in combat.Fifty-plus years on Rutter is as puzzled as he was in April 1945 when Doc Walsh, the group's doctor, grounded him and suggested that he request a transfer out of combat.The author seems incapable of the self-analysis, the self-awareness, that bring such depth and timeliness to works such as E.B. Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"" or Paul Fussell's ""The Boys' Crusade""."
2,Wreaking Havoc,"A good book on author's experience in the less glamorous part of the Pacific Theater during WWII. A good read, not quite as deep as ""Pappy"" Blount's WE BAND of BROTHERS, however another good look at life during our Parent/grandparent's War. Recommended."
5,More Soy Cooking,"""More Soy Cooking"" is chock full of information and gourmet recipes for vegetarians and vegans, and those who just want a more healthy diet. I found the listings of calcium content and protein content in plant foods extremely helpful. The cooking tips, and cooking tools sections were also informative. I like how the information is presented with complete explanations and definitions of items that may be unfamiliar to a novice vegetarian. And that's just the introduction. The recipes are incredible. Every one I have tried is full of taste (which is a little unexpected in a soy cook book), and the presentation lends itself to any table, anywhere. I thought ""The Soy of Cooking"" was really good and have used it extensively. I didn't think it could get any better--but ""More Soy Cooking"" has continued the tradition of excellent information and healthy, tasty recipes. I whole heartedly recommend this book."
2,Would be a good book for people who actually like meat,"While I didn't partiularly care for this book, I can see how others might like it. I'm not a big fan of fake meat products, and this book has an over abundance of recipies featuring processed ""meat"" analogs. I very rarely use this book for this reason. That being said, I do enjoy her baked goods section. So, if you don't mind the vegetarian ""meat,"" you may like this book, but if you don't like it either, then you may want to go with her other cookbook, ""the Soy of Cooking,"" which tends to use more vegetables, temph and tofu rather than ""meat."""
4,Best kids' book for wrapping their minds around the moon,"This is by far the best short treatment I've read on moon phases for kids. The illustrations and explanations are clear and understandable, and my five -year-old is able to ""wrap his brain around"" the idea of the moon rotating around the earth rotating around the sun...not the most intuitive concept around. In most other similar books I've looked at, they seem to assume you can already picture it in your head...this one adds the viewers' perspective in addition to the plantet's. Very helpful."
3,"Good book, but not for reading aloud","I purchased this book to go along with a moon/sun science lesson. It is a cute book with some good, interesting information, but it did not work for the purpose of reading aloud to the kids. I let the kids look at it one at a time, but I used something different for reading aloud. Still a good book for the money."
2,Should have listened to negative reviews,"Okay, I won't throw it out but I'm pretty disappointed. This is like a mini-textbook, not a book for children. It doesn't do much to explain the moon phases in a fun way. No sense of awe or fun or anything but ""Here, hold this orange and this flashlight like this..."""
3,Roofing Coil Caddy Review,"The product is something that has been needed in the construction/remodeling industry for quite some time. It beats sticking the coil of nails in a tool pouch. I would like to see some flexibility in the product when attached to the tool belt. I found when using it and bending over, the nails had a tendency to roll out of the caddy and down the roof."
4,Great helper!,The Prazi Coil Caddy is a great idea. Helps a lot while roofing because it saves you steps. I don't like the sharp edges; just keep it behind your hip.
3,"Good idea, not very durable.","This product is a good idea. You can hold about five coils of roofing nails at a time. Unfortunately, it broke (belt loop) the first day that I used it. I plan on repairing it with rivets. Would a 2 liter pop bottle with the top cut off and a riveted belt loop work about as good?"
5,Great Album,I love every song on this CD. Keren's songs are great listening and beautifully written. Everytime I play the CD to a friend they love it! Must have for anyone's CD collection.
3,Simple but very enjoyable,"I think Keren is a great songrwiter and that's because her songs are not naive as they may seem.Nice sonuds, good lyrics, wonderful voice. I really like this album. The rhythm of ""Boy on tv"" makes it a never-boring song."
5,Wonderfu It Is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is Clinton's greatest project. There are a mixture of songs for the young, the old and the middle aged. This is a touching cd as well as an uplifting. I really enjoy listening to this cd.It has been a blessing to me."
4,JEFFERSON,"Thomas Jefferson was an amazing man, granted, because of his inherited wealth and his slaves doing all the work on his plantation he had all the time in the world..to the manor born so to speak, but still, this man was special. I love Georgian architecture and Jefferson was an amazing interpreter of the style. This book really captures his work, the images are very good and the text highly informative. Eventhough, Monticello is his most famous work, its the UVA campus that I love, it's just perfect. To me that was the apex of his work. Overall, nice book on the architecture of the iconic Jefferson."
4,More than the photos,"Great book with great photos. Th etext is WELL done, not just short captions surrounding the photos. I could have used a little less on UVa and more on Jefferson's influence on other builders in Va., but overall, I was well-pleased with this volume to be sure. A map might have been a good addition as well."
4,Lake tubing,This tube is absolute blast. My three sons ages 5 to 10 were fighting over who would ride it next. It is durable easy to inflate and well constructed. It is a bit large so not recommended for smaller boats unless you inflate and deflate out on the water
3,duo,"Very Fun. But cover tore off at rope anchor point. And, cover replacement coat about what an on sale whole new product costs. Company not very helpful in replacement or standing behind the product. Water flowing under cover feels like it is going up your _____,when you are sitting in the wells. Only got to use it once."
1,Pos ripped junk uncomfortable to ride,Every one that rode this thing got scraped up and bruised the botom very flimsey and then ripped down the middle
1,Junk!,"The first time it hit the water, was being towed by jet ski with no rider, entire front came off! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Bad Choice of repertoire,Good playing but bad choice of repertoire. He could have played more interesting and showy pieces since this is on video.
1,Better alternatives,I really don't understand why anyone would buy this when the Guyot Designs SplashGuardGuyot SplashGuardis available.
4,Works great,"This thing works great, needs a dependable belt clip or something. Too bad this thing is out of date. Get a blackberry."
5,Great!,Great book. Received quickly and my daughter loves it.Good price and no problems. Good quality. We love the I can read books!!!
3,"Fun, but it get's frustrating","This game is a lot like House of the Dead because all you have to do is shoot (tap the touch screen) and all the movement is controlled for you. You'll get 3 different guns throughout the game, one of which has unlimited amo. That's pretty much were all the strategy is. You'll have to quickly reload, switch weapons on the fly, and aim carefully since every bullet is precious.The biggest problem with the game is that it just get's too damn hard. At the end of each level you'll get a tiny amount of health and that's it my friends. You'll be left with the same amount of amo you left off with and usually you find it easier to just restart the whole damn game then try to complete a level with 3 health bars and 20 shot gun shells."
2,Boring game,This game is not like the arcade version. The bullets run out too quickly and the game play is repetitive. The scene makes you feel like you're walking around in circles. The game is BORING to play.
3,"Surfers, Sci-Fi, and SEX (in general)","Another fun collection of gay comics, from 1991. Highlights include:""UNFAIR EXCHANGE"" and ""HARRY THE FLYING PYRAMID"", both by STEPHEN LOWTHER, who brings his ""mainstream"" art style to tales involving unrequited lust, mind-swapping, and a very peculiar alien from outer space. Lowther also supplies front and back color covers for this volume!""WORKING THE SHAFT"" by ""SEAN"" -- elevator repairmen get sidetracked from the job at hand.Other highlights: ""MURPHY'S MANOR"" by Kurt Erichsen; ""JAYSON"" by Jeffrey A. Krell; ""KAKE: HIGHWAY PATROL"" and ""NIGHT FLIGHT"" by ""Tom Of Finland""; ""POPPERS"" by Jerry Mills; ""CATHARTIC COMICS"" featuring The Brown Bomber & Diva Touche Flambe by ""Prof. I.B. Gittendowne"", a super-hero parody; 5 cartoons by A.J.Toos and 10 by Gerald Donelan."
4,Classic Ash onstage,"A great collection of live tracks by one of rock's premier live bands, Time Was...The Live Anthology spans a time-frame from 1970 to 1991. While the sound isn't superb all the way through, it most definitely is worth the purchase price. Disc 1 is a 1991 show from Japan that features 3/4 of the original band in a fine post-reunion show, plus two 1970 BBC ""in concert"" recordings by the original line-up. The two BBC recordings are a little rough sounding, but with so few recordings available from that era it doesn't matter. Disc 2 features eight songs from a 1976 show and are a rare example of the brief period Wishbone Ash toured with a keyboard player. The rest of disc two is comprised of five tracks from the original line-up, recorded in 1973. Overall, another nice addition to anyone's collection. I got mine off Amazon and it's been in constant rotation ever since."
2,Wishbone Ash--Time Was...The Live Anthology,"Truly a classic selection of Wishbone Ash's music, but their repertoire was rather limited and the lead singer is simply awful, Two versions each of two good songs, and the rest are rather monotonous,with terrible singing by whomever was the lead singer. For the price I paid. I got the two songs I wanted,ripped them and put the CD away for proof of ownership--basically a wash in other words.Time Was...The Live Anthology"
4,Love the play!,The two women in this play go through numerous emotions. They find that even though they come from two entirely different backgrounds they have a great deal in common. Well written and full of humour.
2,Xeryus Rouge for Men by Givenchy 3.3oz 100ml EDT Spray,Good smelling cologne if you like the smell of the 80's. I would pass on this cologne. Save your money and get something from Jo Malone.
5,Pleasantly Aromatic,"This product was exactly what I wanted and was received very promptly! I am not sure why this product is not available in retail stores, but am thankful to find it here at such a great price!"
3,Hard reading - better books out there on the Eiger,"I too am enjoying the book but finding the reading very awkward. Perhaps it is because of the German to English translation - I don't know, but the sentences do not flow very well together and many times I found myself having to go back and reread them over again, and perhaps again - to get the gist of what he was trying to convey. Personally - I feel that the book 'Eiger Wall of Death; but Arthur J. Roth is a much more colorful read, flows much more easily, has more photo's as well and also has a nice chronological chart in the back of dates of who and when did the first bunch of ascents on the mountain - successes, failures, deaths, dates, etc. While this book is now out of print it can many time be found as a used copy out on eBay. I just bought one myself recently on there and it makes for a wonderful addition for any person who loves the history of he Eiger and follows it - as I do."
4,The White Spider,"I enjoyed the book and recommend it to all who enjoy the challenges of climbing. The historical account of climbing the north face of the Eiger is quite impressive. The author, having climbed this route, conveys a real sense of the terrain/conditions and the emotions associated with the seriousness of the situations. In the spirit of climbing a route, the author also includes a description of the route for aspiring ones at the end."
4,Risk and rescue on the Eiger North Face,"Heinrich Harrer's words of caution or chastising to those who made the climbing attempt unprepared in equipment, clothing, or experience sound a prophetic note. The disasters on Mount Everest in recent years were partly the result of attempts by climbers without sufficient experience and skill and taking a gamble on decent weather. I commend the author for his ability to relate the travails of the climb. He also recounts failed and successful rescue attempts and the advances made possible by better climbing and rescue equipment. I think few readers will be unmoved by the drawn out death of Toni Kurz in one incident or of an Italian climber in another."
3,A Hard Read for Someone Who is Not Interested in Mountain Climbing,"As students, we had to read The White Spider. It was written fairly well, however it was not a favorite subject for many of us to read about, although we can appreciate Harrer's struggle."
4,THE WHITE SPIDER,The White Spiderthe is a story not only written about the art of mountain climbing but also is a human interest story that tells about the mental and physical trials that takes place for an undertaking of this type. This is a grade A book for any type of person to read.
3,Boring,"Good reading, but the 40's style of writing is definitely boring, uses many and desnecessary words, frases, paragraphs, useless descriptions. I mean things like spending of 6 pages just to tell why the author decided about the importance of write a book about the Eager, talking about the persons who told him to write and who told him not to write! Ouch, how it's boring!"
4,happy holidays,"This is a beautiful collection of Christmas songs for the family with outstanding illustrations from museum quality art works. 25 songs are featured here in this collection. Each song has a brief introduction describing its origins or other important facts, and each image also has a description, often including historical tidbits.The illustrations are great! If you are looking for a book of carols to just sing to or for you young musician to play this is the book to get.We would recommend this book. The colorful illustrations make it a good book for young children to look at while singing or playing at the piano."
4,Well made and detailed,"7 y/o son loves dinosaurs. This one is very detailed and more sturdy than I would have expected. I suppose it could be a display figurine, but he enjoys playing with it and it seems to hold up well."
5,Quality Dino,"My first and foremost criteria in buying dinosaurs for my toddler was that it have very little odor. I have purchased the tub of animals from Toys-R-Us in the past, and was just about knocked over by the plastic stench emanating from it. I thought that if I spent more money, that it would cease to be an issue. My hunch held true. Not being a dinophile, I cannot attest to the anatomical correctness of these figures, but they have a nice heft and paint job."
4,Great beginners guide!,"This book has an overview of how the suspension and brake system works. It has enough information if you wish to test and tune an existing system, or build from proven design plans. However it doesn't have enough information if you are looking to design your own system, but it's a good start.Overall good book."
4,Get the book,"The CD is only the tease; it is the book that is great. Wonderful pictures and informative text. It was originally produced as a box set of book and CD. The CD is readily available [if you seek the book, you really must ensure that it is the book which you are buying--sellers often do not highight this distinction], but the book is harder and more expensive to find. To understand West African culture, you have to understand the role and artistry of the griot or jali. The book goes a long way to helping us achieve this understanding."
3,Hey Baby!,Hey everyone i just want to say this song is sooo cool! you have to buy it! if you like rap/r&b you will probably love it!
5,Bostitch SB-1850BN 18-Gauge Brad Nailer top notch,I bought the Bostitch SB-1850BN 18-Gauge Brad Nailer to use with trim work. I am a home owner and love doing as much as I can myself. this tool makes life so much easier. I can use this tool to put together bird houses. I have found this tool to help in all of our craft projects. A good buy!
4,Bostitch 18-guage brad nailer,"This brad air nailer will shoot brads between the lengths of 5/8 and 2 inches. It's exhaust port rotates 360 degrees to aim the used air away from you and your work. With a no mar tip those precious trim boards will never be damaged. It also features a depth control that allows you to choose how far you want the brad countersunk. The included carrying case helps protect your investment. The 1,000 included brads will get you started."
1,Junk,This thing is a piece of junk. Worked poorly from the first time I tried to use it and finally gave up the ghost completely after only two years of light duty. I will never buy another Bostich product.
2,A disappointment,"This book was chosen as a selection for our church book club, and was looked forward to as the mother of one of our members had loved it.Out of ten members, only one or two could even finish it. We did not think that the quality of the essays was very good, which surprised us. We are a pretty literate group, and read a wide range of books, but this struck the great majority of us as something that might be better read by a college class on religion or womens' studies, but not something for the casual reader.Just too dry and academic in feel."
1,Better for a woman,"Buy this for your lady, and maybe she will wear it... Not really comfortable. Made of that scratchy wool kind of material"
1,Printing errors make this a DO NOT BUY!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PUBLISHER'S EDITION. I did not know that anything this loaded with printing errors could make it into books being sold. This is incredible. The publisher states that they used optical scanning to produce this book to keep the cost down. They go on that a crease in the pages would cause errors. Furthermore, they then tell you to go to the website and if the book is on the website you can read it there. Take it from me spend extra and get a real book."
4,A Flamand portrait,"A Flamand portrait of the ups and downs on a burgeois family whose head turns deranged about chemical research. The title is not about any moral or philosophical absolute but about the ""absolute basic element"" that will allow him to transform substances like the good old philosophical stone of the alchemists. Most of the book is about the wreckage that this guy puts on his family while ruining his family a couple times, but the other main characters , his wife, daughter, a pure gentle guy in love with his daughter and a cold and calculating notary public who's also interested in the daughter are quite original, live and real.Exactly like Flamand paintings it is warm, soft, slow but charming.On the down side Balzac, being an outsider to science, shows not to have a clear distinction in his mind between a scientist and a crackpot."
4,Words,Have been seeking a recording of Words for many years. The remainder of the recording is okay but takes a bit of gettimg used to.
1,Not For Me,"I read a lot of books, mainly Christian/spiritual in nature and frankly, am not finished with this book yet. I forced myself to continue after Chp 1, found chapters 4 and 5, I think, rather interesting, and then back to forcing myself to continue reading. Some sentences and ideas are lengthy and seem too elaborate, when fewer words in a more simplistic way could have expressed the same idea. I guess the general concept is a good one, too many references to too many other pieces of literature made it tedious. Overall, I am not enjoying this book and feel I have gained little from it. In between I am starting Francis Frangipane's, ""You Will Be Found By Me"", which is a joy to read and has the Breath of God in it, simplistic and powerful."
4,"Good, not Great",It took me a bit to get into the concept and the material but it made me look at God in a way I had never really considered before and in the end it was worthwhile.
1,Pure Fluff!,"This book is like cotton candy. Tasty, okay, pleasurable at the time but not really life sustaining or providing adequate nourishment in the long run. It's a fast, engaging read with some thoughtful insights but delivers short in what it actually means to be a Christian and walk with God. If you're looking for better (less feel good, fluffy) insights into how to develop a more deeper, more meaningful relationship with the Lord, I suggest other Christian authors. James Houston, ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" for starters.The Sacred Romance reads like it's title: pure, cheesy, fluff but at least somewhat entertaining like a second rate, romance novel."
2,Too ambiguous for me,"I have read four chapters and have decided not to continue. Several times while reading I caught myself wondering, ""WHAT are they talking about?"" I had a vague idea a good deal of the time, but nothing I could really sink my teeth into....certainly not much to which I could relate. I know the authors' intentions were honorable and it sounds like many people have gotten a lot out of this book. I guess I'm just not the sharpest crayon in the box! :)"
5,A Must Read For Anyone!,"Rarely have I come across an author more succinct, simple to read and real than John Eldredge. The book left me longing for more - in a good way. I wanted God to love me. I wanted to go to Eternal Life so I can be reunited with Him and just bask in His love for me. It challenges your thinking - as all good writing should. I loved it. I own 5 copies. ""I don't know... when I see one I just have to buy it... to feel normal."" ~Conspiracy Theory. But I have read it, so I'm not an ex-government spook, reconditioned by drugs and brainwashing on the MK-Ultra Plan or anything. You must buy this book. They are watching.(I am giving copies to all my kids to read when they get a little older.)"
5,Great Book,"If you really want to draw close to the heart of God, you have you read this great book. I never knew that God can talk to you so close in the daily basics until I read this beautiful book."
3,"inspirational, but lacks practical","The first chapter which introduced the book was very inspirational. I was totally inspired to accept what Eldridge and Curtis were saying. They encouraged the reader to pursue a deeper relationship with God. By describing the abundant life that God had for me, that included adventure and intimacy I was totally inspired. This is what I've been waiting for I thought. Then I kept on reading looking forward to the keys to this life. How do I open myself up the live this more abundant life? How do I take part in the sacred romance?Although it may not have been there purpose, my expectations about life were raised, and then lowered as I have no idea how to get from here to there. I don't want to live a life of dutiful service and small indulgences which is as far as Eldridge and Curtis were willing to take me. I guess the rest of the journey is up to me to figure out."
3,An interesting book,"I was intrigued by the premise of the book. And I think you will be as well. The writers set human history and the kingdom of God as a contest of God winning back his people through love and romance. And there is biblical basis to it. I didn't really find anything in this book that I would object to beyond just a mere difference of opinion. The book recounts in broad strokes what God has done to romance his people, drawing on the imagery of the church being his bride and the language God used (which is quite frank and surprising to those who have never found it in their reading -- it is there, Ezekiel is a great example)Where I would dock the book is in its literary structure. It's pretty sugary. Their style is to not go into great detail and to bring out other points of view and they tend to oversimplify certain core doctrines. I do believe that this book, when read with other ones, is a good part of a balanced theological breakfast. But by itself, it's not very satisfying."
5,God's perspective on my life,"I heard about this book on my local Christian radio station. At the time, my husband had left me and I was feeling a lot lost, insecure and confused. This book showed me a different and more healthy way to look at my situation. This was God's situation, not mine. It pulled me out of my small story and helped me to rest in him while He handled the events in my story. It's wonderful. I am recommending it to everyone who is struggling with loss or doubts in their life."
5,God's Passion,"The Sacred Romance is a journey of love. This book is crucial to any Christian struggling through their faith. It truly is a stream to any dry heart. I highly recommend this ""love letter from God"" , especially to those long-time believers who have (in our service and striving ) forgotten the wildness of our God.It captures the essence of a follower of Christ-total passion and wild abandonment to the Lover of our hearts. In memoirs,poetry excerpts,and personal examples from their lives,John Eldredge and Brent Curtis make you passengers on their journey of recapturing their First Love. This book is among the best I've ever read- you will never look at life the same way!"
4,not applicable to me,"I have never read this book. I bought it for a friend as a gift. She really enjoyed it, for that reason I will give it a four star."
1,Disappointed,The Sacred Romance Drawing Closer To The Heart Of GodI was very disappointed in this book. It is not all it is cracked up to be. After everybody telling me how great it was on the Intimacy with God.I didnot make past chapter 2.
2,Sacred Romance,"Read this book as part of a Christian book club.... while it might have been a good read to some, it was lost on most of us. Just couldn't get into it...."
5,"Helps you understand life, pain, disappointments and love!",A great book which gives you a framework to understand hurts and disappointments in life and how God can use those to really love you well! It is the language of the heart and shows you the vastness of God's heart for the reader. Great for discussion and small groups!
2,Ummmm......,"Perhaps it was a mistake for me to read both ""Wild at Heart"" and ""Captivating"" first... This one felt shallow to me compared to those later two. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it just didn't do anything for me. I stuck it out halfway through, then gave up. I tried picking it back up later, thinking maybe I just had a bad day, but it was the same result. It just didn't feel as deep and personal as Eldredge's later works. Also, there wasn't as much scripture to back up statements. I don't even remember hardly any of the content. It didn't speak to me as strongly as ""Captivating"" or ""Wild at Heart"". It just felt more cold and distant. So, perhaps it would've been fine if I hadn't already read the best. =}"
4,Not a Girly Book,"This is not a girly book; don't let the title fool you. The Sacred Romance was a really important book for me when I was in college. It helped me understand the big picture of the Bible: the story of God and the story of my own life. It helped me understand the difference between living by the rules and living spiritually.Curtis and Eldredge pull a ton from Frederick Buechner, one of my top-five favorite authors. If you're interested in this book, you might also want to check out Buechner'sThe Sacred Journey: A Memoir of Early Daysas well asTelling Secrets(and anything you can get your hands on of Buechner's, non-fiction and fiction alike!)."
1,zzzzzzzzzzz fustrating and BORING,"I read this; or I should say, started this book many times in a small group at church. I can in a week late and had to read two chapters. I love to read; and have excellent skills. I was bored to tear by this book; despite my craveing to get closer to God. Everyone I talked to in our group founf the book dry, boreing, dull and hard to follow none of us realted to it. My group (all the small groups in the church were useing it) made up of graduate students in Ministry studies and young career women gave up on the book as a goup decision. We felt we weeren't being fed, that no matter how hard we struggle alone and as a group we were not finding the gold others saw in the book. I have tried a number of time; based on reviews, and can't get into it, much less though it. zzzzzzzzz"
3,Confusing Presentation of Good Points,"Full of great reflections on God pursuing us as a lover pursues his beloved, this book will help remind you what it means to be loved by God. The writing is somewhat disconnected with stories and reviews of prior topics interrupting the flow of thoughts. Still, worth the read."
5,A liberating look at experiencing God from the heart.,"I knew Brent Curtis before his untimely rock-climbing accident. Brent was a man who truly lived the Sacred Romance.I first experienced the Sacred Romance on audio tape. I have since read the book, and listened to the tape series (available through Dan Allender's ministry) three more times. No other Christian authors have come close to explaining what I have always known intuitively - that knowing God means knowing Him at the level of the heart.This is a book that men can treasure courageously, and women can savor romatically. You will never view Christianity in the same light after experiencing the Sacred Romance."
2,A Disappointing Book,"I received my copy recently, and have begun thumbing through it. Despite the time the authors spent in Japan and the support of the Japan Foundation, the book is immediately disappointing. Beginning with describing the color of takuan as ""vile"", I quickly discovered a variety of errors in the book. For example, the authors misidentified what a hot water kettle sits on in a tea ceremony. The iron implement which supports the kettle is properly called a godoku or gotoku. The kettle sits within either a ro (sunken hearth) or furo (portable hearth)."
2,Same - great til it breaks,"I had the same issue as someone else. I loved it til it started shorting (and shocking me) and then it just went dead. I guess for $3, you can buy them in bulk...."
3,Jabra C250 Boom Headset,"This headset seems to be sturdy enough. Sound quality is good. It is difficult and awkward to use, though. Durability is my priority so I am satisfied with this headset."
4,"Good item, great price","Have had one of these before. My wife wanted one, and mine was getting beatup in my briefcase. They're comfortable, stay in the ear, good voice pickup. Great price."
2,Great until it breaks,"I'm on my second one and the same thing just happened. The earpiece is great when it's working, but after about a year, just like my first one, there is a short or something as it goes in and out at first and now can't even hear anything through it(I have tested other earpieces, so I know it's not the phone). Just a heads up."
1,The worst movies ever!,"These are two movies, which were apparently filmed very, very early in the featured artists careers and they are not the main characters. Extremely low budget--poor acting of ""main characters"" and poor film quality. I bought my copy from Amazon Marketplace because it was less money. The movie is definitely not worth more than a movie from the $1.00 bin at a discount store. In fact, it is a waste of time to purchase out of curiosity. I wish I could give you the storyline; however, my copy did not even start at the beginning, but 10 minutes into the movie. It was done so poorly, I could not sit through it. Whatever roles the kung fu kings played, I missed it. Horrible, horrible, horrible."
5,My Introduction to Miles,"This is the album that introduced me to Miles and I've been hooked ever since. His trumpet is so clear and forlorn especially in the splices of ""lost in Madrid"". This album is fresh on every listening, do your self a favour and add this to your collection you won't regret it its pure modern Miles."
2,average,"i heard alot of hype about this disc.but it is by no means a 2nd coming of Sketches OF SPAIN.Miles has moments but it's not on par with Miles's better soundtracks such as Jack Johnson.Marcus Miller's work hasn't dated well with Miles.he is a very Talented Bass Player Writer,Arranger,Producer&Musician but he adds nothing to Miles for me.he ain't no Gil Evans."
5,"Brilliant, sexy, and moody","Marcus Miller and Miles Davis have created a masterpiece! ""Conchita"" is the best track. Mysterious and beautiful. Really spellbinding and seductive. Its hard to describe. But its worth the money trust me! A real piece of work"
3,Coil nails,"The description of this nailer states that it takes nails from 1 1/2 to 3 1/4. I have been unable to find anyone that sells less than a 2"" nail for this gun. I also e-mailed the company to see if they could help me but received no response back. If you need a gun that provides a wide range of uses then you may be dissatisfied with this nail gun."
1,Almost Obsolete?,"I couldn't find nails for this gun in my area. 2"" nails could be ordered for it but cost three times as much as it does for real siding nailers. It is heavy and not used by many framers either, most use stick nailers."
1,Bostitch N80CB,"I purchased a Bostitch N80CB coil nailer from a Lowe's HomeImprovement store in Charleston West Virginia on the 29th ofSeptember 2001. The unit has, since its date of purchase,failed to function properly, frequently jamming to the pointthat the tool is useless.I have contacted Bostitch via e-mail, post and phone in anattempt to have the unit either replaced or my purchase pricerefunded and have received NO satisfaction from Bostitch.I would not recommend this tool nor ANY Bostitch product basedon the VERY poor performance of the tool and Bostitch's failureto warrant their product."
5,Christmas Day in the Morning,"""Christmas Day in the Morning"", is a lovely book and I bought it to share with my Grandson as a Christmas gift.. We read it together after opening Christmas presents. What a nice memory for both of us."
3,Christmas Day in the Morning,Children's book. I did not realize that when I purchased the book. Gave it to my 3 year old grandson.
3,Nice but solemn story,"Great Christmas story about the true gift of love (not things), but may be too solemn for younger kids. Good for Christmas book collection, but not one of my kids' top favorites."
3,Disappointed,"A children's book. I thought book was more adult oriented, with a compilation of true stories with a Christmas theme. Bought as a gift for family with adult children, but was too embarrassed to give, sokept to give to a child at another time."
5,A very tender book!,"My mother use to read this book to me when I was little. She grew up on the farm and her father got burned and could not do the chores. This is a very sweet and loving book about a true gift. One that does come from a store, but comes from the heart."
5,A must add to your Christmas Book Collection,"I vaguely remember watching a short movie adaptation of this as a young boy. I only ""discovered"" the book a few years ago. It's now my favorite Christmas story. I must say however, one of the big negatives is that I must be allergic to the book because my eyes get watery every time I read it. Buy it for yourself and then buy it as a gift to give. The message reminds us of the true meaning of Christmas."
4,a surprise book from Pearl Buck,"I have read some Pearl Buck stories but this one was different. You can see from the cover on the book how beautiful the art work is and the story is good too. The young boy (Rob) in the family wants to give his father something special for Christmas but because of the hard times people were having and the lack of money he has to think really hard what to do. The father was so pleased with what he found Christmas morn that he looked at his son in a new way. He never expected the gift he got and it cost Rob nothing. We can all do similiar things without money,it is done with love."
5,Great book!,This was a surprise book for my husband for Christmas. We already knew the story so it was fun to finally get it in a book.The pictures and story are great!
5,THE ONLY REASON THIS BOOK GETS 5 STARS IS,because i couldn't give it six. do yourself a favor and read black first. THANK YOU MR DEKKER
5,I couldn't stop reading!,Seriously - The entire serious is very suspensful and so good. I started with book one and I think that's the only way to read this series.
3,Red by student,Red is a good book individually but gets boring after you read to many of its forerunners. The plot was ok except for the fact that I read too many books with about the same plot so I got very bored after a while. The author did have the characters right though This book was ok. 3 &#10032;'s.The story is ok but it is pretty generic and gets boring very fast. It needed more twists and turns to get you excited.The characters were perfect though.The characters are very well portrayed and are constant.The only problem is that aftre the book as a whole gets boring everything gets boring.
4,Dekker has done it again,"the second book in this series, Red doesn""t disaappoint. We continue to travel in both worlds with the action moving rapidly to apocolypse in each. New character overlaps are well developed, and though I should have seen the end coming, it caught me off guard. A great read!!"
4,2nd Circle Trilogy book,"I came upon this author by accident, but once I did I couldn't read fast enough. This series is considered Christian fiction, but it's not preachy, has lots of action, and really gets its message across with metaphor, not scripture."
3,SOLID CONTINUATION,"After finishing Black, I had to continue on with Red.Red follows on from Black with tremendous pace and anticipation. The first third of the book was page turning, then it dwindle off. As with others I continued to at least see where the book was taking me. Red however picks up again in the final third of the book to once again thoroughly entertain.Having the complete volumes of The Circle, I am now eager to follow on with White.Once again the story is compelling, I cannot fault the delivery however there is something missing that if I could put my finger on then undoubtly Ted Dekker could also.Once again I would definately recommend this series. These are the first books of Ted Dekkers that I have read and will be exploring more."
4,Circle of trilogy,"Very enjoyable read - you can read each on its own, but it makes for a good series"
5,"Labels work well and look good, would recommend",I found a PDF for these Avery labels and placed in a non-printing layer in my page layout program.I printed address labels and labels for photo greeting cards that I sell. I printed them on my photo inkjet printer and the labels look great when selecting the 'Bright White Paper' setting in my software's print set-up. They come off the sheet easily (hence 'Easy Peel') but put stay put when they are on an envelope or greeting card.I would recommend these labels. Easy to use and they work very well.
1,Not Easy Peel,"These labels were supposed to be easy peel. However when used to label bottles, they stick as tightly as any other label and are NOT easy peel."
5,Always Reliable,"I use this product on a regular basis and rely on them in my business. I've tried generics before, but they just didn't cut it. Avery is a little more expensive, but very reliable and always worth the extra pennies."
4,Good price for great software!,I was very happy to find an old version of DVD Studio Pro online since I've been wanting an authoring program a lot more flexible than Toast for many months now.I am glad I didn't have to fight on e-Bay to get this!Thanks so much for posting the listing in Amazon marketplace.
1,Product does NOT run on iMac,The description says it runs on the Mac platform; however it doesn't. It only works on much older Macs and its an academic version
2,Can't get this tent to stop leaking,"Coleman is notorious for designing tents whose rainflys don't adequately cover the entire tent, leaving the seam between the floor and side of tent exposed to the elements. After setting the tent up in the yard, a rainstorm blew in, leaving puddles all around the edges of the floor. Since then, I've sealed the seams 3 times and I'm still finding areas that leak.This tent might be okay for a backyard campout under the stars, but I would never trust it in the rain in a real campsite."
5,SO GOOD I HAD TO GIVE IT 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!,This figure is awsome!!!!!! I have had it for almost 8 months and have played with it alot. The only problem with it is the rappeling harness didin't come on but other than that this is a really awsome figure. I highly recommend it!!!!!!P.S. I didin't know until here recently but the M4 buttstock can be extended. Super Awsome!!!!!!!!!
4,Pretty good,"This figure is pretty good for all of the accessories you get. The headsculpt is pretty bad on this one, but it can be covered up with the helmet, goggles and baclava included. The external vest is pretty cheaply made. Apart from that, all of the other accessories are decent."
5,AD&D Combat will never be the same!,"This is a very good book, I believe that everyone who wants more realistic Combat Rules and new Strategies, Proficiency's and Tatics will enjoy a lot this book. Many things is incluided like the new Critical Hit's System and table's of critical Hit's Severity. Ignore The guy that gave 1 star to this book, he probaly never read it or even have played AD&D because if he had, he will not say a stupid thing like a Goblin with a dagger taking off a arm from a Human. So if you want good and realistic Combat to your campaign you should already had this book! GET IT!"
2,"Almost, but not quite entirely useless","I've had this book since the week it came out and I've never used anything from it. I offered my players a chance to vote on using the critical hit system in here, and they were overwhelmingly against it. Their main complaint was that if they were using it against monsters, then monsters would be using it against them, and it was too easy to die on dumb luck.Perhaps it does make combat more realistic, but when a single swing of a sword involves 6 dice rolls and takes about 10 minutes to consult all the right tables and figure out all the modifiers and effects, I think you're doing something wrong. But, hey, maybe some people like that.The monster tactics section is more useful, and if a DM uses it properly, he allows his monsters to become more than a ball of hit points that the characters have to reduce."
4,A good fight for second.,"This is the only players option book I've owned so i can't speak for he set but this one has some good stuff. The Book basicly shows how to use miniatures and 1 inch grid board for a very intersting for of 2nd edition combat. There are also many rules and proficences tha later became standard ruling in 3rd edition D&D. Examples are attacks of opportunity, and weapons with reach. A lot of the books elements are best used with figures and gird board but others can be used with out. Honestly I simple went cherry picking for the rules I like and left out what was to complex but I find the Minifigs are a great way to save my voice DMing, and my player like the visual aid it provides so if you like another way to fight in 2nd edition AD&D this is a must."
4,Rage,"It is an interesting movie.There are a diversity of complex characters that are impressive.The movie forces the viewer to imagine what is going on, as the audience only hears what is going on.My favorite characters were Minx(played by Jude Law),Lettuce Leaf(played by Lily Cole),Mona Carvell(played by Judi Dench),and Anita de Los Angeles(played bt Adriana Barraza).This movie is not for everyone obviously.It is basically the characters talking about their world.The background is simply a colored wall.It is easy to see how many would grow tired with the simple setting.But if you are a fan of films with in depth conversations,this movie is for you."
1,Not as good as the plastic case,"I got this hoping that there would be more room for the saw, blades, and rip guide than there is in my plastic case. While the footprint of this case is much larger than that of the plastic case, there is less room for the saw's cord. As the other reviewer noted, this case is nearly a cube. The cord has to be kinked sharply to one side so that the case can close, and this will cause the cord to short eventually. (I had the same problem with my Bosch reciprocating saw's case.) The case I got was also poorly made. The lid was not aligned and the latches were loose. The case was returned."
1,WRONG PHOTO,"The photo provided for this item is wrong. As you can see from the description, the case is almost a cube, not the oblong toolbox pictured."
5,"The best, in my opinion!","I LOVE this stuff. In fact, it's so great, even my cat has a bowl every morning. It's pretty funny seeing a cat eat raisins, but for some reason, he loves it as much as the rest of the family. The flakes in this cereal to me are the best. I don't care much for the other brands simply because they assume the taste of their packaging. I think that Kellogg's does a better job on Raisin Bran and have been buying it for years. It's hard to fight success! Highly recommend!"
3,Aminogenesis Therapeutic Facial Repair,I like how smooth and soft this product makes my face and neck feel. I would like to see a sunscreen added. I've used this product before. The particular jar of lotion I received does not have the good fragrance I remember it having in the past.
4,Good shirt for outdoor wear,"Very cool shirt on hot days. It is a very light material and doesn't look too technical. I got compliments on it when I was at a gas station. The only thing that is weird about this shirt is its kinda short to tuck in and if I were to order a size up than the shirt would be too baggy. The length of the shirt is my only complaint, although the sleeve lengths are fine."
2,Jams in the screw gun,These thing jam in the quickdrive gun and they are hard to remove when jammed. Do no know if it is a gun or a screw plastic problem but they are a pain for my subs.Also be nice if Amazon would put the # of screws that are in a case.
3,Useful,Twist top under cap makes it harder to get a drink. Twist top doesn't open fully with out pulling up on it and that requires a little fingernail work.
4,Great Dance Compilation,"Great compilation. Perfect for us ""real"" house heads looking for the same goove passion in our party music as we did in those underground days of house in the eighties."
4,Creative Imagery,Journey Through Mind's Eye is filled with visual and sensual imagery. It takes the child on a trip which he helps to envision. It is a fun journey that is relaxing and self-affirming for nature lovers and kids of all ages.
3,Very good TV - but annoying quirk with volume control,"In a search for a bedroom TV, I found this set and the Sony's. I feel that the picture quality of the Toshiba FST was slightly better than the Sony. It also had a better set of video inputs on the back of the set than the Sony (Toshiba allowed 2nd set of inputs to be composite or component video; Sony 2nd set of inputs is component only). The only feature I feel is missing in the set is color temperature control (the Sony does have this).One problem I encountered with the Toshiba was that when turning up the volume, there is a huge jump between ""4"" (barely audible) and ""5"" (almost normal volume). I call to a Toshiba CSR claimed that this was normal behavior for this TV. Since I need lower volume levels occasionally, I was forced to return this TV. A second unit had the same problem. Just be aware of this if you are considering purchasing one of these for your bedroom or will need to run it at low volume levels."
3,Buzzzzz Hummmmm,"This TV has some great reviews, and is a consumer report best buy, but it hums. When you turn it on, there is a noticable hum from the back of the unit. It is annoying at low volume levels. Hummmmmmmmmm.Other than that it looks great. Back to the store for this one."
1,I would not pay 2 cents for this poorly made toy,"The statement below is the opinion of the author.Usually, one would expect to at least get the toy out of the box before it breaks, but not this junker. I bought one for my daughter's 4th birthday, and we were going to play it. I began to remove it from the box. One squeeze to the plastic tweezers, and they broke, and I don't mean some sort of really hard squeeze. Took it back to the store to swap it out. The girl at the customer service counter saw the box, and said ""did the tweezers break?, We've had a lot of those."" I went to the shelf to get a replacement, the first box I opened was already broken. The next two broke on the first squeeze. I walked down the isle, and my daughter now has the original Operation game, which works fine. This toy is as bad as they get, In my humble opinion!"
3,Eh....,"Bought this CD on a complete whim. First impression: Sucks. As i listened to it more tho i started to think it wasnt that bad. Dead Bury Dead is an awesome track, but my favorite is Down, which has an awesome intro, and a really clean feel. The worst song on the CD is probally The Nameless King, which sucks completely. Carly is an awesome singer tho which, as i said above, he proves on ""Down."" Overall, the CD is not bad, but could be a hell of a lot better. I'm not one to completely dis this band though because i heavn't listened to any of their other CD's, or am a particular fan of theirs. Not bad, but could be better."
5,True Innovators,"To start off, I love this album. While it is not the hardest album this past year, it is a nice change from the glut of metalcore bands that are out there when they all start running together and sounding the same. I love heavy, but heavy is not always good. With all that said, I can easily say that this album stands as my favorite album by Candiria seeing as how we get to hear the overall vocal dexterity at hand (aside from the death metal growls). Candiria is an amazing band, and while they have simplified their sound slightly, I do not see anything wrong with it. The songs still pack plenty enough punch to piss off your neighbors, yet they also add beauty and melody, something that had been lacking in previous albums. Highly recommended."
5,Sometimes change is good,"When most bands tweak their sound, it's not a good thing. Candiria made a change, but the music is still great! It's not as much a change as the music being focused and more cohesive, but still very much Candiria. I have always loved these guys, but the music was all over the place. They have to be incredible musicians to just pull-off the musical stunts they did. This CD is more accessible to listener, not to mention some songs could get radio play, therefore increasing Candiria's audience. The music is hard as ever. These guys can rock! There is less avant-garde jazzy type time changes, but these songs are very well written and don't suffer from the loss. THe members of this group almost died for the art (they were all severly injured is a bus wreck going to a gig) and still came back and made a instant classic. This CD will earn them more fans, as is should. Buy this CD TODAY!!!"
2,My Fav Metal Band Just Died....,"Candiria has lost my attention. This is a shame -- considering they were, at one point, my favorite metal band. Dillinger Escape Plan have also died a similar Emo-inspired death. God Bless you, Meshuggah."
2,"the talent is still there, but it's far from interesting.","I respect candirias decision to venture into a ""simpler sound"" (a good euphamism I think) but you can turn on the radio and listen to played out mall-metal and it would be equivelent to this album. i'm not going to say that they sold out, after all, they've tackled most every style of music, sometimes unsucsessfully (there's a trumpet solo on the coma imprint that would make clifford brown roll over in his grave.) but i just think they should have chosen a more interesting style to experiment with instead of the tired sound of linkin park. they have ceased to be a V.O.D. and are now a P.O.D."
2,No Book-long description needed...,"If you're a fan of all other Candiria albums, I'm sorry to say, you'll be disappointed in this one..definitely their weakest album yet. I don't need to write you 4 paragraphs on why this album is good/bad like the previous users....bottom line is:This CD sounds almost nothing like any other Candiria album before it (and that's not a good thing). A lot of clean singing/choruses, very melodic, not very heavy. Some parts here and there get back to that nice groove-laden heavy candiria sound, but those are few and far between. I'm a huge fan and am sorry to say I'm disappointed in this album."
3,Too long to wait for shipping,The book arrived as promised in new condition. My only beef is the amount of time it took to ship the product.
2,Ugh.,"Difficult, even unlikable people make for often terrific movies, but what does some blackmailer have on Helen Mirren that she got stuck in a turd-stuffed turkey like this? What seems to make sense on the page has the life sucked out of it by the reliably low-wattage of Eric Stolz. Peter Fonda, likewise, seems to have wound up in this movie after losing a bet. You could change all of the names of the characters and it wouldn't matter. This is a plug and play film about generic intellectual X and how her selfish out-there-ness wears out her loved ones. Zzzzzzzz. This director clearly does not have the gift of getting worthwhile performances out of his actors.Anyone who already knows who Ayn Rand is won't benefit from seeing this movie(which has one of the most relentlessly irritating jazz scores I can think of). Anyone who doesn't yet know who Ayn Rand is will, after seeing this film, still not know.What a waste."
1,Hatchet Job by Rand's Critics,"Don't waste your time. If you're interested in Ayn Rand's history, rent the Oscar-nominated ""Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life."" This piece of cable TV melodrama is based on Barbara Branden's ax-grinding book -- hardly an objective source of information, as proved by the contradictions between her account and her husband (Nathaniel's) account of the same facts in his own autobiography. This film will go down in history as nothing more than a curiousity, a cheap little movie that answers the question ""What would result if people who despise Ayn Rand made a movie about her love life?"" The answer isn't pretty."
1,DVD Manufacturer HORRIBLE,"I received two copies of this DVD from Amazon.com. The first one stopped in the middle, froze and would not play. It was warped. I returned it and they sent another. Very good. The second one I received got me two scenes past the first DVD and did the same thing. Don't order this DVD from AMAZON.com."
2,I wish I hadn't bought it.,"I'm an Ayn Rand fan (I don't dare say ""follower"").I didn't like this movie because in spite of its objectivity, it really wasn't about Ayn Rand!I mean if they were to nominate it for an Oscar, Ayn Rand's character would be ""the supporting actress"".I would have much preferred if the focus was on her. I wanted to learn more about her.If you're really interested in getting to know what she was about, try ASIN: 630529285X. It's a documentary and VERY accurate and capturing."
3,Not for the Ayn Rand enthusiast,"If you are a true, die-hard, Ayn Rand fan, and are familiar with the details of her life, then you will find this perspective a bit hard to take in spots. Definitely a TV drama program...where all of the emphasis is on her personal love affairs, and not much on her as an author, or a prophetic genius of phylosophy. However, if you are willing to objective, and allow yourself to weed through the drama, there are little tid-bits of good film making...but mostly, it is a love story as has been told many, many times before..."
1,I expected better.,"When I watched this movie, I expected vivid and gripping presentation of Ayn Rand, a figure that fascinates me. I was stupified to see that it was very inaccurate and portrayed Rand as a person who excommunicated people and made knee-jerk decisions based on nothing but her own vanity. As anyone who has read her personal journals or ""The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics"" knows, this could not be further from the truth. It was difficult to watch the smearing of one of the 20'th century's greatest thinkers."
2,THE PASSION OF AYN RAND,"The Passion of Ayn Rand looks to be an incredibly intense film that was marred solely by a poor Digital rendering. Helen Mirren is as usual incredible with a dead-on Russian accent no less. I'd suggest renting it if only to see an incredible actor deliver another incredible performance. When Helen Mirren is on the screen, no one else seems to measure up to the level of realism and believability she brings to her roles. For that reason and that reason alone, I suggest you rent this film just to see a master artisan at work. 2 stars."
1,Nothing But A Smear Job,"No, Ayn Rand was not perfect, but this film is nothing but a smear job. If you want a better sense of what the woman was about, try the 1998 documentary ""Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life"" or read any of her books. The fact that she was a WOMAN has a great deal to do with the hostility towards her exemplified by slanderous defamations like this movie. Yes ""Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life"" was written and directed by people who actually like what Ayn Rand had to say. So what! It is far more ""fair"" then this shrill piece of propaganda."
1,Dishonest,"This film, and the book on which it is based, is filled with so many distortions, speculations, contradictions, and straight-up lies, that it may as well be fiction. For the truth, see ""The Passion of Any Rand's Critics"" by James S. Valliant. Better still, If you want to know Ayn Rand, read her work."
1,"Why bother with the message, attack the messenger",Those people who hate Ayn Rand's ideas (pro-communist leftists and anti-abortion conservatives) or enjoy watching Jerry Springer will love this movie. Those who want the truth about Ayn Rand should look somewhere else.
5,One of the best recordings of music on earth,"This album definitely stands out as one of my favorite cd's i own or have ever heard. It is not possible to dispute Ustad Sultan Khan's virtuosity on sarangi, his soothing voice, or his incredible sense of music. This rendering of Raga Bhupali by Ustad Sultan Khan on sarangi and Ustad Zakir Hussain on tabla is a gem not to be missed by anyone. The 2nd track features Sultanji singing as well. His voice is so haunting. Sultanji's feel for melody is perhaps unequaled in the world of music. This album proves it."
