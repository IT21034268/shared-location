4,"Jet 6"" Jointer Mobile Base",The mobile base was easy to assemble and works well. It should last the lifetime of the tool. A very sturdy accessory.
2,Quite displeased,"After spending nearly $100 for this base, I am quite disappointed. First, the axle bolts had fine threads and the base was coarse threaded. I had to strip the threads on the axle bolts to get the wheels on. The 'brake' system is a joke, as other reviewers have noted. The swivel caster hides under a tongue flange, making it impossible to lock ""with your toe"" as the manual suggests. I compare this to the Delta universal base under my table saw, which has a wonderful ""step on - tap off"" locking mechanism that is always readily available. As noted, even though this is sold specifically for the JJ6 jointer, it does not fit. Through bolting is required for real stability. If you only move your jointer to get to something behind it, you may be pleased. If, like me, you have to store your tools in a corner and roll them out and lock them down when needed, you won't be pleased. But, the jointer is a dream."
4,"Stand is good quality, but Install Instructions are poor",Install instructions are not written well with poor graphics. Received floor stop assembly and nowhere in the install instructions did it explain where to but the stop or to even install it. Went to HTC website to look at the mobile base picture and there I saw where it is attached. Instructions need to be rewritten.
3,Kinda/Sorta works,The holder is larger than it sppears so you have to have a big sink for this item because it takes up a lot of room in the sink. Good construction although I don't know why the end piece swivels. I kept the holder but I think that a rubbed bronze suction cup holder would have been a better idea for me.
4,"Interesting, entertaining and original film.","OK, this contains no spoilers.It is a fictional film about a superstar DJ, who like many others from the UK, plays nightclubs in Ibiza during the summer. It shows what happens to him as a result of his lifestyle.Mainly a drama, with some humour.It is an uplifting film, and a believable one, capturing the Ibiza culture well.I recommend it to all who regularly go clubbing or to gigs, to whatever genre of music, or anyone who is in a band."
5,Awesome movie!,"This movie is simply awesome. The story and the storytelling are great, the cinematography is also amazing. I just love it!"
4,"A very good, very different movie","I've watched this movie twice. The first time I believed the first frame of film which reads something like ""This film is based on a true story"", something like that. It was hard to watch for me because it brings out a lot of emotions. I sometimes didn't know if I should laugh or feel bad about the guy's situation. Then I read these reviews here on Amazon and saw that someone compared it to Spinal Tap and that it actually is not true at all. I watched it a second time and for some reason knowing that it was not true it really allowed me to just laugh and I did that much more than the first time. The tennis scene with the humus was hilarious and really remined me of Spinal Tap. If you like Spinal Tap you should like this, although this is a lot darker. Just remember that it isn't true."
5,Touching,"An ex-colleague of mine had partial hearing loss from an accident many year ago. He gave me a ring when this film was released. Excited as ever, he talked about ""the dj who goes deaf."" I was shocked when he described the film, thinking it was just anothe raver flick. While the first 30 minutes is nerve-shattering house music, drugs, and goofy antics, the film turns a corner and presents a story of loss and redemption. DJ Frankie Wilde (an award winning performance by Brit Paul Kaye) goes from stardom to deafness in a flash, and it's at his worse that we the audience decide to cheer and root for him as he finds love, music, and happiness in places he never would have expected. The soundtrack and locations are amazing (shot on location I believe). Can't wait to see this on DVD and get the soundtrack!"
4,Great gift,I bought this as a gift and it was a happily received item - I actually bought all three books in the series. Great purchase and easier to find here than in stores.
4,An excellent resource; the best way to learn ASL from a book,"This is an excellent resource for those who wish to use real-life ASL as spoken by the American Deaf Community. Unlike other books on the topic, The American Sign Language Phrase Book avoids ""Signed English"" (the use of ASL as a word-for-word analog to spoken English). The book presents the grammar of ASL, showing sentence structure, phrasing, even slang, and noting when spoken English words are inappropriate. This is the only book I've seen that could really facilitate a friendly conversation between a hearing and deaf person.The down side? The illustrations are hard to get used to. Because The American Sign Language Phrase Book (properly) emphasizes facial expression, there is often not enough detail given in illustrating the hands.My ASL teacher recommends this book to the exclusion of any other ASL dictionary"
3,Sign Language Phrase Book,This book teaches the use of simple phrases that are used in everyday speech. A good book.
3,Good for Beginners,"This book is clear, with sketched pictures instead of photographs. It places the signs in the order that one would use them in ASL. While I would recommend this book for beginners in sign, it just doesn't offer much vocabulary beyond conversational sign."
4,"""The American Sign Language Phrase Book"" by Lou Fant","I have been studying A.S.L. for over two years. ""The American Sign Language Phrase Book"" is the latest book I am using as I move ahead in my abilities. This book demonstrates the progression of signing in phrases rather than just single words. The illustrations aren't always as easy to read, but that is why I keep my older books for reference. This phrase book is necessary to help learn how to become fluent in A.S.L. and to be able to converse with the deaf and hearing impaired."
3,"Great content, terrible drawings","This book has very clear explanations of ASL grammar and structure, and lots of useful vocabulary and phrases, but is hobbled by really confusing drawings. In many instances I had to look up a sign in another book (""Signing Illustrated"", which has extremely clear drawings) because I was unable to understand a drawing in this one. A worthwhile book, but not practical as a single reference."
4,Very Thought Provoking,"This book about children and there struggles and hard- ships is amazing. The book is ten short stories that are being told to a ""Minister "" by the children them-selves. It's like having a conversation with each of the children your self.It's not hard to put your self in the place of the ""Mnister"". I enjoyed this book so much that me and my wife have read it twice. It has helped us look a children in a new light. The book has some religious overtones, but it 's not preaching to the audience. The things that children struggle with is told in a fun, carring, and thoughtful manner with young, strong, lovable, characters. My hats off the the author of this book you have a winner. Thanks, I have never read anything like this before. We'll be looking for more from you."
5,Thank God for Men Who Care!,Minister Reggie Hill has a gift and he has certainly used it by penning this book. To read it is a blessing for anyone who has a heart.
5,"Softest, most comfortable comforter I've ever felt","Really, really comfortable. My 5 yo son has one and refers to it as his ""ank"". It's like a security blanket."
2,This thing SHEDS,"I have the King size sage - it performs as described in the 5-star reviews, but after a couple of washings the fleece side starts to shed and the fleece loops multiply like Tribbles!!! I had to replace it! It's made by Berkshire Bedding but no company website exists so I could not contact them about it."
5,One of a kind - have to have resource,"PTs, OTs, rehab specialists, educators, parents, etc. will enjoy using this book that is readily understandable and easy to follow written by someone with extensive experience and training. Well researched, documented, and illustrated, it is one resource that one has to have."
4,69 camaro easy snap together,"this was definately an easy assembly. this model would be great for kids or adults who are looking to experiment on a cheap model. i built the model to spec first, disassembled, modified wheel location and then re-assembled with new lowered stance. in my opinion, very fun to build and modify"
3,"Okay, but gets old fast","I just bought this game and I think that it is fun to play for about a 1/2 hour, then it quickly becomes boring after that. You need to write down passwords or you lose your game. I enjoy the Nemo game more than the Monsters Inc game because there just seems to be more variety. Maybe it's because I am only about halfway through each game, but I can say, it's not my favorite."
4,Great!,This item is great. Its nice two have to really good games in one cartrige. Both games are really fun and a slight challenge but the graphics are grea and so is the base line of the game.
2,haven't played it yet...,This is supposed to be a Christmas present so it's hard to say how much fun the kids think it is. I checked it (before I put it into storage to be wrapped later)and it seemed to work well. Hopefully the kids will like it.
3,"Nice looking, but.......","This is a nice looking medicine chest, but the materials are sub par. If you're flipping property& want it to show well then fine. I found when I put several items on the bottom shelf that thepaint finish on the bottom shelf (where the right side connects with the bottom shelf) separatedcausing a a crack in the finish. So you can't put much weight on the shelf. It is made of particleboard underneath (as my crack revealed). For the price I suppose it is a good buy, but for the longhaul (I've had mine almost 2 years) maybe not so good."
3,very high cost to ship,the tissues are good. but handling cost was very high. could have put in small envelope and send for under $2. instead paid $7.
4,MYSICHEART,"I love this case it seems to be very durable and it is stylish and conpact. I attend school and have to carry a bookbag and I didn't want anything with extra bulk and this is perfect, it will even fit into my bookbag with my books. There is a pocket for your papers and a separate zippered pouch for cords, and the matching adjustable carrying strap is a plus, because I prefer a shoulder bag rather than short hand held handles, so if I don't carry it in my bookbag then I can carry it on my shoulder and have my hands free. I would reccommend this bag to women who like bright colors, it comes in about five different colors."
5,Praise His Holy Name,"I'm over filled with joy as I sit here and review this CD. I think that the gospel music industry has been needing a recording of this type for several, several years. Thank God for This choir. My hats goes off to the Minister of Music and staff for thinking enough of the saints of old to record something like this. I'm a young man that loves church music of this type. To those of you who hasn't heard, just listen and be bless and enjoy."
4,Fun live album.,"Live at La Zona Rosa is a decent live release from alt-rock band Sparta. The album features songs from bothWiretap ScarsandPorcelain. While the production quality is not the best I've ever heard on a live album (I've not heard any others by Sparta, so at the moment I don't have any alternates to suggest). Despite these issues, it is a good listen and would most likely be well received by fans of the band. The music is strong and the band displays a lot of passion live. The tracks were also cut so that you can hear a bit of back and forth between the band and the crowd, adding to the live experience.For those who are interested in more of the experience from the same concert I would suggest looking intoLive At La Zona Rosaby prog-rock band Coheed and Cambria."
5,Delicious and dramatic!,"I have enjoyed listening to this CD. The voices and interpretations are rich and dramatic. I'm a newcomer to this repertoire, having been familiar only with the first selection, but I would love to have the other volumes as well. I have a couple of other Naxos early music CD's, and intend to buy more- the quality is excellent and the price unbeatable!"
1,Poor editing ...,"... with many errors, mistakes, even typos, as well as poor research and many inconsitencies - I put it away after about 100 pages. What sounded like an interesting, real world story turned out to be a vast disappointment. Is there nobody out there who writes high quality business novels?"
2,Cheap costume,"I bought this costume to wear for a school event, I am a teacher and thought it would look cute. I am very disappointed in the look of the costume compared to how it looks in the picture. The picture online makes the red bow look very big and appears to stick out from the material. Not so. It is made of paper-thin material that is sewn down to the costume. It looks cheap and tacky. The hat is much too tall and does not stand up. I also think it is silly that the white gloves are not included, you have to buy them separatly. I am strongly considering sending this back and finding something else to wear for school."
4,Did not work on a MAC,"Luckily we also have laptop PCs for our kids to play this on.Looking back we probably should have just gotten the Wii version (even though itwas hard to find before xmas)The Wii version is more likely to have been updated, the version we got here (for both PC and MAC) is abunch of years old."
5,Nice upgrade to your battery cable,"This is a well built cable with integrally attached ends. Looks good installed. Note: length is from the tip of one end to the tip of the other, so it seems shorter than the listed length. A great value. You will be glad you found this and did not waste your money on another higher priced product."
4,Tablesaw comments,"I've owned this saw for the past couple of years and have been happy with it. The fence seems more solid and smoother than others in this price range. TEFC motor a plus, keeps dust out of the innards of the motor. It is also very smooth and vibration free. Plenty of power for anything I've wanted to do with it.Only complaint-the blade guard is difficult to remove and replace, can be an issue when switching often between dato set and saw blades."
5,Finest piece of equipment I've seen in a long time.,"Once I got the boxes opened and inspected the pieces, I knew the quality had to be there. I took five hours to assemble this saw, taking my time to read and understand all the instructions first. The saw went together without a single hitch. Out of the box the saw was cutting perfectly straight. I readjusted the ripping fence one time to fine tune the cut and I was cutting perfectly. The fence glides along the top of the table with ease. This saw is very quiet when operating. The 10"" blade made quick work of the 2x4's and sheets of plywood I ran through the saw. Using the HTC mobile base with the Jet Saw makes it very easy to move around the garage. This is one great saw."
3,"Nice Saw, bad fence.","This is a fine saw, but the fence doesn't stay level to the piece being cut! I've adjusted the fence numerous times, but each time I lock it into place, it veers to the left. I have to press forward on the fence to keep it from moving to the left and I still end up with ripped pieces that are off by 1/8 to 1/16.J.M.E"
3,an eye opening tale unfortunately presented in a bland tone.,i found mary crow dog's style to be bland although it was very graphic. perhaps having to read this book as an assignment jaded me but i found it hard to stay awake. i enjoyed her sardonic humor towards the overbearing male sioux as well as her honest and understandable distaste for the white establishment but i felt myself lacking empathy for her cause.
2,lacking personal responsibility,"I thought this would be based more on Indian culture, but it was more of a racist book blaming the white man for everything.. sadThe book blamed alcoholism on a lack of things to do and yet the wealthy also fall victim to it. While Native Americans have been victimized, there is a need for cultural assimilation in order to prosper in a capitalistic society. One can do that without giving up their identity.."
5,Lakota Woman,"I learnt so much from this book, and felt myself getting angry because of her experiences. good on her for telling her story. L'Ohanna"
4,Lakota Woman,"A riveting first hand account of how the Native Americans have been mistreated by the US Government, society, and even their own people. Could not put it down. The side of Native Americans that we do not get to see, deeply family oriented in a time when society is breaking apart the family. Their ""old ways"" are more civilized than most of what we have in this country today."
4,Rameau Orchestral Suites,I like music from the baroque and early classical periods but didn't know much about Rameau so I ordered the two CD's of his orchestral suites. They are certainly pleasant listening music.
5,Excellent book for a beginner,"I have read the book ""Tricks of the Windows Game programming Gurus"" by André LaMothe. I did not know anything about game development before buying this book. By reading this book I got a good idea about computer game development. Now I am working on my own 2D game engine.With out any hesitation I can say this is the best book on game programming for a BEGINNER.The book is about 2D games and some of the concepts in this book may be little out of date. But when you are a beginner what you need is good SOLID foundation, may not be the best technology.The book covers lots of areas of game development, all the samples are given clearly explained and they are easy to follow. And I specially like his writing style.I would recommend this book to anyone who is starting in game development."
2,Let kids learn coding a little...,"I cannot understand why so many people judge this scriptum to be good. In my opinion the language is the first annoyance (does the author try to be a teeny?) and furthermore the level of the book - from a computer scientists view - is really low: How can he talk about optimization and running time and afterwards give us an example of recursive functions dealing with fibonaci-numbers, which is absolutely suboptimal?!!! All in all: A book for kids who want to start windows-coding."
3,Choppy...,"I found the book hard to follow as a beginner. I've had a few semesters of c++, so I'm only a newbie to DirectX. This book would be a good supplement book for the details it presents, but I found myself getting lost having to go re-read some of the chapters, only to get lost again. When teaching beginners, the best thing to do is go over some material and give them an assignment that uses the material covered (like in school!). Lamothe tends to tell you to just look at the source on the cd. We need examples, or even better, design/build a game as you go!"
1,Maybe Lamothe should read 3D books instead of writing...,"Amazing! His books are STILL stuck in the early 90's and he or the publisher STILL use misleading titles to lure experienced developers to what seems like a never ending rewrite of his For Dummies book...I'm sure there's a great deal of money in the broad ""intro game dev"" market when compared to the relatively small ""experienced/pro 3D developer"" market.Maybe in a couple of years Lamothe will start covering techniques used by real developers using DirectX 7 or 8... Till then, this guy's books are on my ""must avoid"" list..."
5,Andre' is amazing,"If you ever want to know how to program your own video games, there's really one thing to look for - Look for any book that has the author Andre' LaMothe's name on it. This guy is truly amazing with all the knowledge and expertise of game programming he teaches you through his writing, especially in this book. And that's not all. If you ever have a question about programming, you can always e-mail him and he will be able to help you out. This book is definitely worth buying."
2,Caution - not Relevant!!!!!!,"Although a good and comprehensive book at it's time, it is relevant for directX 6 or 7 at best. The fundamental changes made by ms in directx 8 render it not relevant in many aspects and anyone buying this book should consider that. There are many things a newbie might get from this book but it mostly deals with outdated 2d concepts and the examples look and feel old (386 old). The author is good and I would definitely go for the directx8 or 9 version of this book but this one should not be sold any more (not at that price anyway)"
4,Explanations are helpful,I think this is a solid book. I'm about 3/4 of the way through but I thought I'd write a little blurb since people seem so critical. It's been helpful. I think the author does a good job emphasising basic facts to make people understand things. I have 2 or 3 other books from Mr. LaMothe so I look for new ones from time to time... Good work :P
5,bottom-up approach to 2d game creation,"I have read many game programming books, and this book is the only one I have seen that teaches you from the lowest levels. This author is a very good writer, and his experience and knowlege comes right out of the book. If you want to learn how games are made with c++ from the lowest levels I would recommend this book of his or any other one of his game programming books."
4,"Giant, vicious Rats!","Just finished reading this book after picking it up at my local library. I've been a big fan of Zindel's books after reading Raptor, Reef of Death, etc. This was definitely an entertaining tale of smart, mutant rats that break free and try to take over NYC. If you are looking for a relatively fast read with a fast-paced plot, this book is for you. However, I think Zindel's other books were a bit better; the ending seemed a little too...simple...but still a great read."
5,Angry Rats,"This book is great for people who would want to read about ratstaking over the city. In this book Rats, blake big ugly rats are attaking peoples bodies and also kiling people in water by jumping onto then and going into their bodies. They are taking over the world. this book is more for people who like reading about violence or blood and guts. a good quality of the book is where the rats attack and fight back with the rats. I would recomend this book to both male and female but more to male because it has gross parts like rats eating their bodies and eyes."
4,RATS!!!,"Rats is a very interesting book.It is the first book i've read by Paul Zindel.It is about a 15 year old girl named Sarah and her little 10 year old brother Michael.They live near the Staten Island Landfill.The dump is infested with Rats.After the islander's got sick of the stench they decided to cover the dump with asphalt.Since the landfill is polluted with Methane gas and other poisonous substances.It cannot escape through the asphalt.So instead it is inhaled by the rats and they begin to mutate.The rats become furious and begin to wreak havoc on the island.To see what kind of horror is unleashed pick up a copy of Paul Zindel's ""RATS"" today."
1,Book NOT appropriate for children,"Rats, written by Paul Zindel, is NOT appropriate for children, even older children. The reviews say this book is for ages 10-13 (or 11-14, depending on the review), but the graphic description of the carnage is absolutely putrid. My son was sickened by the first chapter and would not finish it."
2,A gruesome book,Rats by Paul Zindel was an ok book. The storylne was not very good. It was all about mutant rats killing the people of New York. It explained things into great detail. I thought that the story was very gruesome and I did not enjoy it. It would be good to read though if you liked horrror stories. I would recommend this book for people between the ages of 10-13.
1,Stereotypes!,"I find it sad that Paul Zindel uses rats as the evil, killing creatures in his book. It is stereotypes! The word 'rat' puts an image of a mangy, evil, squinty-eyed demon into our minds - which is done the work of this book. Rats are not like that! I think this book is a real downer! (Poor rats) No disrespect to Mr. Zindel, but to me, honestly, rats do not need such misunderstanding."
3,"Quirky humor, abrupt ending","Quirky humor, reminiscent of Being John Malkovich in particular (if you liked that, you will almost certainly like this). Pacing also reminded me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Nice camera work, intriguing concept, many thought-provoking questions (e.g., if I have one person's soul and I get another one, where did the first one go?). I'd rate this film highly indeed if it didn't leave way too many things hanging, including the central plot element (Giamatti's quest to improve his acting by taking a vacation from his soul) and the overall narrative. Still, a lot of sly and absurdist laughs. Three stars seems about right. Definitely worth watching despite the gaping flaws."
4,Give it a look!!,"This movie reminds of Being John Malkovich. It is a cerebral trip and entertains anyone with a dry sense of humor. I'd recommend this movie to those that like odd concepts and Paul Giamanti is, as usual, gives a great performance."
2,Disappointing,"This movie has an outlandish premise in the vein of Being John Malkovich or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: your soul is a physical thing that is extractable, easily removed and returned. In addition, it is sometimes preferable to be without a soul for a while, or to borrow someone else's. It's not the premise that bothered me but the fact that the film did nothing with this concept: neither dark comedy nor insight into whether the soul is the essence of humanity. Some visually beautiful scenes, very good actors, and yet it all seemed flat and...soul-less. This film did make me want to see Uncle Vanya on stage, as I was reminded what a great play it is."
3,Debatable,"the closest competitor to the street racing syndicate game would have to be the need for speed underground serieshowever, this is no game for the younger younger generationshallow girls, dancing bods, etc.altough the modifications seem much more realistic than the Need for Speed Underground series (which actually are also all real parts) the level of customization is completely different.SRS also has an advantage over NFSU with its real based damage and repair costs along with a tricky dyno that can be hard to use and benefit from if not completely knowledgeable about its functionhowever, need for speed underground easily beats out SRS in the racing experienceSRS has extremely extremely loose physics, tapping the control stick a little too hard results in an unwanted drift or slidein the end, the pure winner would have to be NFSU"
3,good but chaos,I rented this game and thought it was great then it got a little boring then a little more fun.Once you get the hang of this game it is great.But here's the frustrating part when you get a car at the begining if you sell and think you get your money back go for it.You wont get your money back but if you buy a new car you'll end up with barely enough money.So take my tips dont buy a new car and dont sell. If you follow these tips this game is great.
5,Loved this book,I have read this book from cover to cover and it is great! As a new camper I have read several books on RVing over the past few months and this is one of the best. I usually check out books from the library to save money but this is one I will purchase and keep.
4,"Good, very good for a budget release","It is difficult to fault Naxos when they produce full-price quality recordings like this CD at less than half the price of other labels. The young Austrian counter tenor Bernhard Landauer gives polished performances of 8 Dufay chansons, and the five members of Unicorn add variety to the program by preceding each chanson with lively instrumental pieces. 62'37"" playing time, useful notes and full texts and translations. A bargain."
1,Cheap junk,This tool is cheap and does not work well in tight spaces. I couldn't get it to fit snugly on the plugs. Save your money.
5,12 of their best ballads from 1976-87.,"This long-deleted and very hard-to-find compilation features 12 of their best ballads and I highly recommend it to all fans of classic soul balladry. ""Give It To Me"", ""Are You Going My Way?"", ""Say Yes"", ""Try It Again"", ""Chocolate Girl"" and the ever-popular ""In The Mood"" are timeless ballads and my personal favorites from this CD. This is one album that will definitely help set the mood for an intimate and romantic candlelight dinner for two."
3,Not as bad as I thought...,"This game wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first three. There were a few things about this game that were horrifically terrible, including corny and dumb sound effects. Overall it was still fun and still had some things that were dark and creepy."
4,Very Very Scary,"I have never played the previous games in the series, but I heard these were pretty chilly to play. It is - especially with headphones and complete darkness. The fear from unknown sounds and noises are the feature i liked the most. Game play was a bit odd as you are not in first person view, but it works fine. The graphics and animation are top quality, i really enjoy trying scare myself when I play. Very cool and a lot of fun. It won't give you nightmares but it will rasie your heart rate."
5,Best Game Of The Series,"This is one of my most favorite treasured games from the SH series. The Room would have to be the most scary, and creepiest of the games, and the gameplay/storyline is very fun. This game is really scary compared to any other game I have ever played. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointed...,"I've been a big fan of the Silent Hill series, so I figured buying SH4 would be a great thing to do. WRONG!! At first, the game seemed OK. After a while of dealing with the repetitive and increasingly annoying portholes and immortal monsters, I quickly lost interest in the game but decided to play it to the end to see the ending. The plot about Walter Sullivan believing the apartment was his mother was beyond idiotic. Protecting Eileen got very irritating, especially since she was very slow and couldn't do anything to help. Overall, the game was boring and I wouldn't recommend it to die-hard SH fans. If you've never played any of the other games, then you might like it."
2,What the heck happend with Silent Hill?,"This game is not as good as the first three. I expected the forth one to be the best because the 3rd game was nearly as good as the 1st one. It's not good a good game because unlike the other 3 it's not scary/disturbing. The first cutscene is very scary, but not the rest of the game. The badguys are lame and aren't scary. There are gigantic two headed Siamese twin monsters, that can be killed with only a pipe. Most of the bad guys are like this(really weak). The bad guys practically wait to be beat up/shot. The lamest bad guy in the whole game are zombie nurses who burp when you het them. How stupid is that? The ghosts are also no fun, because they take forever to beat, and theres lots of them. These are the strongest bad guys, but it's impossible to run away. It's really annoying.At the end of the game you have to walk though the same levels again.This game is really lame, and it shouldn't be played unless you're a baby or toddler!"
3,All downhill from here,"Ah, Silent Hill 4. You aren't bad but you're proof that the series has gone stale and should be put out of its misery.I found the game to have an incredible storyline but the gameplay elements mistepped so hard, their femurs burst out and rocketed sky high. In their quest to create inovative gameplay involving a room, the game designers seemed to have reached their limit. And they disbanded now. It's fun but it really is the end of the series."
4,Engaging storyline draws you into the world of Silent Hill.,This game did a great job of drawing you into the story. I felt like I was actually trapped in the apartment. The story was very spooky and the game had a lot of scary moments. I did complete most of the game with a walk-through as I found this Silent Hill to be difficult. This let me enjoy the storyline and not wander about for hours on end. Great graphics and sound. I do recommend this game to Silent Hill fans.
1,Fail attempt of a silent hill game,I've played all of the silent hill games. #1 and 2 to me were very good...not much for combat but the story lines can really hook you in..but to me from the 3rd one and on they went down hill. silent hill the room by far was the worst to me...i had to force myself to keep playing. course the monsters were nice but could have been better. story line didn't grab my attention..it even made me bored to play at times. honestly dont purchase this game..i understand if your a true fan and must play them all(like me) but if your new to silent hill get the second one thats worth your money!
3,MY REVIEW,"A GOOD GAME WITH A GOOD STORY, ITS A SHAME THAT THIS GAME IS FULL OF STUPID CREATURES AND BORING WEAPONS."
2,"Uh, why can't I kill or harm my enemies?","GHOSTS FOLLOW YOU EVERYWHERE, impending your movement and investigation of the environment. Just annoying. This game is definitely the weakest in the series and, frankly, a waste of your money. I stopped playing mine relatively soon after I bought it. Shame.If you're looking for a GOOD survival horror game, I recommend Resident Evil (any of them, but I am currently enjoying #4), Silent Hill 2, Fatal Frame 2 or 3. I highly recommend Indigo Propehcy as well. Though technically not 'survival horror' in nature, I think its elements will appeal to many survival horror fans. Check it out."
1,Not What I Expected,"This is not like the Disney Storytellers which lift the music, dialogue and sound effects directly from their films. NONE of the original voices from the film are on this. NONE of the original songs are on this.If you want an audio version of the film, this is NOT it."
1,This soundtrack did not hold my daughters' attention at all,"We thought we were getting a version of the movie, and I suppose it is, however all of the good parts are taken out and you are left with the more aggressive actions of the movie. I was dissappointed, I would like my money back on this one. Robbie"
2,Not from the movie :-(,"This is not the soundtrack of the movie Quest for Camelot--it is just the songs performed by someone else. They are still good songs, but it's disappointing not to get the ones on the movie."
5,Excellent,Great sound. Wonderful use of dynamics and varied tone colors.Great program. Hope for the future of classical guitar. Eschews speed and flash (although technique is solid) in favor of musical involvement. Passionate playing. If you like David Russell and Marcelo Kayath.
5,outstanding!,"I heard the first track on the radio and just could not get out of the car; I just sat there in the parking lot till the end of the ""Suite del recuerdo"". I have seen since then some of more sentimental listeners crying while listening to this suite, and I am quite surprised that Mr. Vieaux's recording of this suite remains the only one available. That's not to say that I was not fond of his performance, quite the opposite! I think Mr. Vieaux really shows us why he was the winner of the GFA Competition, and the only flaw with this disk is poor sound on track 4. Outstanding recording, and dirt cheap!"
2,DVD Technical Review,I have exchanged this DVD twice and find that the quality of the transfer is unacceptable. Fox Lorber simply did a poor job of transferring this film to DVD. I recommend that you NOT purchase this DVD until they do a better job of transferring the movie. The movie deserves better.
4,Excellent film - poor DVD,"One of the early Wertmuller films, allready demonstrating all the hallmarks of her style. A brave film, uncompromising in its grotesquerie, and driving home its bleak message as only Wertmuller can. Not as compelling as the later masterpieces, or demonstrating as much of the trademark humour, but still putting most to shame.The film deserves a full five stars, but Fox Lorber's dvd deserves zero - a very poorly done transfer made from a very poor source. It looks like the sort of thing you could put together at home from an old vhs copy. This powerful film needs a proper dvd transfer."
5,Clean Cuts,"Purchased this saw blade for a miter saw that takes an uncommon 8 1/4"" saw blade. I used it to cut pine and red oak trim as well as to square up red oak plywood. Cuts are very clean with no splintering or tear out. Blade is still sharp after numerous cuts."
4,Freud saw blade,I make cabinets and find that the Freud TK304 has save me many hours by making sharpe clean cuts.I recommend the Freud TK304 or any other Freud saw blades.
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"I can not explain to you how much I hated this movie. If I could give this movie negative stars, I would. Why is this movie so bad you ask, well I will tell you. The movie does not flow together at all. Prime example is the scene with the reporter in the house. The scene lasted about 5 seconds, he was in and then out. The reporter then showed a ten minute interview that supposedly took place in the 5 seconds. It supposedly takes place in southern California, but the sheriff sound like he came out of the Smokey and the Bandit. The sheriff thought the English guy was Mexican. What's the deal with that? Even though I hate this movie to the core of my being, I have made it my mission to buy every copy I run across. I am stockpiling these in hopes that one day I will own every copy. When I do, I am going to have a big bonfire and chuck all of them into it, thus riding this world of such a blight. I do not want aliens coming down after we are all gone and finding that movie......"
2,Disapointing...thought it would be better.,I couldn't finish this book. I thought it would be in simplier terms and more interesting.
3,"A good thing to have on your shelf, not a great read","While this book is considered a classic and is cited in many articles about the game, The Physics of Baseball is pretty dry. Granted, I am not a physicist, but an avid baseball fan. After reading numerous news articles and hearing about the book on baseball shows, I picked up a copy of this book. While I found things like the physics of a curveball or physics of a corked bat interesting, a lot of the discussion was over my head, which granted may say more about me than the distinguished author.However, the problem with this book is that once it loses a reader, it is hard to get back on track. This book almost seems more of a reference book than a book to be read cover-to-cover. Surely, it is a novel, incredible contribution to an area that has been neglected, but I am happy (for now) to remain a fan and let the physics take care of themselves."
2,Why You Hated Physics in High School,"Remember that physics teacher you had who was clearly brilliant but just had no clue how to explain anything? You got him right here in ""The Physics of Baseball."" What could have been an engaging study for physicists and ordinary fans alike is a highly technical and terribly dull look at the forces that affect balls, bats, and the game itself. Adair makes no effort to explain technical terms, uses no anecdotes, and leaves ordinary readers far behind. Just be glad you're not in his class, or sitting next to him at a game."
5,fascinating and enlightening,"some parts are a little technical for me, but overall the book was one of the most interesting and educational books I've read in a long time. it changed the way I watch baseball and gives me even more respect and admiration for those who can play at the professional level. It takes what seems to be a simple act of hitting or throwing and makes me wonder how any can actually do this, then I think about how amazing the human body is to be able to perform like that. wow."
3,A good book if you have the background,"The Physics of Baseball is not physics text - it uses the principles of physics to explain things like why a curveball curves, what happens when the bat hits the ball, how far a ball can be hit, and so on. The book is not math-heavy, but it does assume the reader has some knowledge of basic physics and can follow technical discussions.The only part of the book that disappointed me was the discussion of corked bats. Adair uses a theoretical model to prove that a corked bat doesn't help - that corking a bat will make the ball travel only a few feet farther at most. While he may be right in his conclusion, I think his theory should be tested with experiment. A batter hitting a pitched ball is a complex system, and it's quite possible Adair's model is too simple."
2,Where's the handle?,"Potential users: Click on the ""See Larger Picture"" link. Notice that (threaded) hole on the flat part at the top? That's where the handle should be, the handle that gives you oomph to push and guide your stock with the miter gauge. Makes the cutting LOTS easier and more accurate with larger pieces!Jeez, including this handle with the gauge couldn't have cost 'em more than a couple bucks--but they don't. Nor do they give you any way that I could find to locate and order one."
2,No stops,"This is a sturdy little unit but it does not have stops for 90 degrees, 45 degrees, etc.Taking into account the other review, I would not recommend this unit to a friend asking advice."
2,I Expected Better Quality,I always expect the best from Jet products but I was disappointed with the miter gauge. This miter gauge is poor quality and has no pre-set notches.
4,Lucid Presentation of MacIntyre,"Kelvin Knight provides a concise, but adequate sample of MacIntyre's work. The articles contained in the text are sufficient for a novice of philosophy to gain a light grasp on MacIntyre's main points, especially concerning Machiavelli in response to Strauss's analysis of the topic. The articles collected, especially ""The Claims of 'After Virtue'"", contain a counterpoint to much of Strauss and Mansfield's work. This is very valuable considering the proliferation of the historian and his prodigy's opinions on the topic."
4,"Good as a reader, infuriating as a book",This is a reader for those who need to become familiar with MacIntyre and do not have the time to dedicate to actually reading his complete works. This is *not* a reader for those who want to really know MacIntyre's thought. Not only do you miss out on recent MacIntyre since this was this published beforeDependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (The Paul Carus Lectures)etc. it has all of the typical shortcomings of a reader. Ultimately you're making the choice to save time by accepting the editor's version of what is important.Buy this if you need basic MacIntyre fast. Skip this if it is going to infuriate you to only know half the story.
4,Pink paper,"Paper was fine. Package was a bit torn up, but the paper was fine. It arrived on time as promised."
2,Not enough for this woman No sirree,"I think Maya angelou is a wonder artist as well as poet, author, african american woman, etc. i would definitely recommend this c.d. to anyone. But as far as her having enough websites for us children to do a report on. It's totally over. I mean I had to go to about 17 diiferent places just to see how many books she wrote about and now I have to read her book just to find out Ms. Angelou's life so she has inspired me to do Langston Hughs thanks a lot Maya Angelou. Sincerely kandi Sandusky."
1,Very Disappointed,"Marinco 12VBRAD ConnectPro 12-Volt Charging and Trolling 6-Guage Wire Receptacle Adapter for Trolling MotorsAfter struggling with this item for an hour, it ended up in the trash. A complete waste of time and money. The receptacle size was inadequate for my 6 gauge wire, meaning that I had to trim off strands of wire to get a good bite and the wire coating does not fit into the boots so I end up with exposed wire outside the connector. Then trying to eliminate the exposed wire, I stripped the threads.Save your money and get a couple butt joint connectors instead. I'd rate the is a 0 if that were an option."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring.",I have spent hours reviewing the designs in this book and have found it very inspiring.
3,great service,I was excited about purchasing this item but disappointed with the packaging. The prompt service I received in returning it certainly rates 5 stars. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
4,The only thing available,My wife uses this 'temporary' hair color often because she has thinning hair and it is not as harsh as a full 'permanent' hair color method. In fact she cannot find anything else that is as easy to apply and gentle on her hair. This is sometimes a problem for me as it is difficult to find in many pharmacies. I've had to take her several places--as far as 50 miles away--just to find a refil.One thing I notice is that the described color changes between applicators. IE: Dark brown is lighter in the comb than the brush.She might use something else if there were another brand of brush on hair color--but we've been unable to find one. So until then this is it--the only thing that works.
3,cover,"This really covered the gray, but it doesn't ever completely dry, so if I ran my hands through my hair, I would get brown streaks on my hands. Drying with a blow dryer helps but still, not completely dry. But it definitely covers the gray."
4,Very useful product!,"I've bought this product many times and it works perfectly. Problem is, it's hard to find in stores, so I'm glad I can buy it online."
2,Um no thanks,"Ok this is like mascara for your hair. Clumpy, do not try to style your hair after applying this. I mean it covers the gray hair but i would only use if i was going to put my hair in a ponytail wouldnt dare flat iron or use curling iron after applying. Ive found Henna natural hair dye love it and great for the grays...."
3,deb,THIS PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE DRIED UP WHEN I RECEIVED IT.ITS HARD TO GET OUT OF THE CONTAINER TO PUT ON THE BRUSH.
1,Caution re: expired cartridges,"The previous reviewer (4/15/11) noted that the cartridges received had concealed, expired sell-by dates. I just had a similar experience, although from a different Seller (whom Amazon will not permit me to name); note that this was not the Seller now shown. The cartridge arrived without the box, where the expiration date is printed, requiring me to open the foil bag where I found the date on the cartridge itself - Sept 2008. It is one thing to sell a product past it's ""sell-by"" date, it's another to sell a product so old it is likely to be defective - as in this instance, where the item is over 2 1/2 years past that date. It should also be noted that nowhere in the product description is it stated that this item is being sold past its expiration date."
1,Ink Cartridges Outdated / Expired,"April 15, 2011I ordered and received two HP 11 ink cartridges from TJ Salons via Amazon.com. The date codes were deliberately covered over by another label to conceal the expiration dates.After removing part of the covering labels, I found expiration dates of 09/2009 and 11/2007.There was no mention of outdated items on the amazon.com web site at time of placing the order.I request that they be replaced with fresh ink cartridges.HP 11 - Print cartridge - 1 x cyan - 1750 pages"
1,Cartidges Out of Warranty,"I buy 14 cartidges, 13 was out of warranty. Date 2008, 2009BadThat come without original boxesNot recomended!!"
3,Ink,I thought I was purchasing a new ink cartridge...I must have not seen that it was a used cartridge which was refilled...my fault
5,Nice product,"These cards are durable and cute. We have other Eeboo card games, and bought this one at the same time, knowing that our child was not quite ready for the challenge of matching the word to the picture just yet. However, we are starting that this summer with our now 3 year old. The thickness of the cards make them good for little hands to manipulate without bending them."
2,Not Hornblower,"Kent does not have the writing skills of Forester. I am a Hornblower devotee and after two readings of the series fifty years apart, was looking for more. The Bolitho series is like beef soup after having grown used to beef stew.Bolitho does not flesh out as Hornblower does, POV switches without warning. A lover is introduced and snatched away as though she were no more than a 3X5 note card. A spy is unmasked with no warning they had one in their midst. And the confusion of battle seems more like something I'm watching on television than actually involved in. Bolitho is always being overwhelmed and suddenly rescued from death by the same person.For all it's faults. The Bolitho series remains a fair to middling light read and I shall continue until I stumble on a better substitute for Hornblower."
5,Fantastic!,"I've read most of the great Sci Fi authors. Kent has become one of my favorite! Stand into Danger is an entertaining novel, rich with adventure, excitement and even a bit of romance. Since I live in the Caribbean and have been to some of the islands mentioned in the book, the novel was especially entertaining for me.I've ordered the next two books of the series and can't wait to start them!"
5,Alexander Kent Author,"I have, over the years, from the 1970's, accumulated every one of the Bolitho Books. If you are a water person, and have any interest in Military History, or action adventure stories, this is the series for you to have. I have found Mr. Kent's (Douglass Reeman) writing to be profoundly interesting, and extreremly well researched and throughly thought out.. I recommend this series highly."
3,Going From Good to Okay,"In a nutshell, the book is okay. Overall, the story is getting bigger: More cast of characters, more plot complications, more arcs...On paper, this sounds like a good thing, but in reality, it is starting to read like a story that just keeps growing and growing with no end in sight, and not in a good way.There are certain plots that feel like they should have come to a head already, but instead, they keep building and building and building... Also, it is starting to feel like complications are being added just for the sake of making the story more complex as opposed to being necessary for the story...Overall, I do like the characters, I like the story, I love space operas, and will probably get book four. The stage is set now to start bringing plot arcs to a conclusion. Otherwise, if this story keeps growing in book four, I will stop with this series since it can easily be one of those series that just keeps going forever and ever with no end in sight and not in a good way."
2,My two cents,"A truly terrible series by a truly awful writer. How that man has sold so many books, I have no idea. SOSS rips off Peter F Hamilton, Frank Herbert, Dan Simmons, Babylon 5, Star Wars, Foundation and just about every other space opera of the past half century while adding nothing new to the genre. Laughably badly drawn characters who ""exclaim!"", atrocious science, and an attention disorder style of writing that doesn't allow any chapter to last for more than two or three pages."
3,Offbeat developments keep this series interesting,"""Horizon Storms"" doesn't have the novelty of newness like the first book in this series, or the darkly dramatic developments that made book two pretty exciting, but it does keep the story moving along nicely, and provides a few new angles I didn't see coming. Most of these angles involve human characters we've come to like being converted into human/water or human/wood hybrids by the elemental races whose war this series is slowly but surely turning its attention toward emphasizing. As there isn't much scientific justification for how these mutations can take place, the series is starting to feel a little more like fantasy rather than science fiction, but that's okay. Story and characters are still compelling, and I still want to see how it all turns out. And, ultimately, that's what a series like this is all about, isn't it?"
4,Getting Better,"I have to admit that this series is getting better. While the Saga of the Seven Suns is certainly not great science fiction, it is really good sci-fi with characters you grow to care for. The first two books were OK, but this one really ratchets up the suspense as the war with the Hydrogues continues. This time however, betrayals and political intrigue take on epic proportions: humanity is at war with humanity; civil war is brewing inside the Ildiran worlds. But we also have a greater understanding of the various alien entities: the Hydrogues, the Faeoros, Verdani (World Trees), and the interesting Wentals. Anderson has certainly created some original characters. My greatest complaint with this series has always been the drawn-out story. There are too many characters and the story could certainly use some better editing. That being said, Anderson has my attention and I look forward to the next book."
1,STOP THIS SERIES!,"Gods below! I can't imagine this series is still going on! Hasn't anyone written to try to stop it?The plot goes round and round, suddenly there's another hidden old intrigue and dark secret that we all don't know about that pops out completely unrelated, which becomes relevant to the plot.I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY this novel if you value your time. I think there are 7 books (7 suns) coming out and all of them have failed to deliver any thing beyond what the fathers of sci-fi out there have already written.A complete waste of time!"
2,Blue Balls,"I am a High school student from DC and I am a sci-fi lover but Kevin what happpen? Dawg, this joint is redundant....... Boring, /... drags on an on and on never reaching real climax. Quality is better that quantity!!! The Saga should really can be 2 book Series.A real good 2-book Project.I was thinking in the back of my mind while reading the book that Kevin must be doing this on purpose just to keep getting the public to buy 4 books. I hate when authors drag it out, I bet all 4 books are already written. And they just chopped it up to make dat dough. I see a hustle a mile away. When a drug dealer does that he looses customers to people with good product. I need that Fire!!!! Not unfulfilled desire.Blue Balls..."
3,A good start...,"The disc holds three parts - the first part talks about Samurai and the setting o Japan in general. The second examines how Japan was slowly united, first Oda Nobunaga, then under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and finally under Tokuhawa Ieyasu. His family would rule Japan as the Shoguns for over two and a half centuries. The last part deals with how Japan was again open to the ouside world.I give it a three because a lot of details are missing and there is a lot of repeat and overlap. Scenes are recycled many times and sometimes the events and history can get confusing. There are no extras and, frankly, even with a person who knows a lot of the history a timeline would have been nice."
4,good history,"If you like Japanese history you will enjoy it. I liked it, but it was like being in a history class(not very exciting). I really like samarai history so It was good for me."
3,Watch out for the cat scaredy mouse!,I bought this book for my three year old daughter because we both enjoyed Beware of the Bears by the same author. This book is just okay. We have read it a few times but it has not become a favorite. The story revolves around Squeak the mouse who is being egged on by his sister to steal some chocolate cake from the kitchen. Along the way Squeak thinks he sees the cat everywhere and in the end he finally meets the cat and conquers his fear of it. The illustrations are cute but the story is not all that engaging. I think there are better books out there for kids that deal with the issue of facing up to your fears. I would rank this book more in the borrow from the library catagory as opposed to a must own book.
3,ok but kind of cheesy,This video did have me sweating by the end but it was kind of cheesy. The moves could have used some extra spice and the instructor was pretty anoying. Overall it was alright. I really like dance videos compared to traditional arobics but there are better out there. I will keep using it to change up my workout but not my favorite.
4,Fun!,"This w/o is fun. I'm choreographically challenged, but I had no problems following this. It's not a hard w/o, so I will save this for days when I don't feel like working out."
1,Weak...,"None of the moves are done in a slow, sexy, graceful way. The only stripper-like move was the pretending to take your shirt off bit. The only moves that were sexy (although they were not done very sexily in the video) are available in the Sexy Moves for the Nightclub series which is also a better workout. The video was cheesy and funny and if you have ever been to a strip club in your life you will not recognize anything here. It is actually more tame than the nightclub dance series I mentioned with an extra helping of goofy. I'm sorry, but if I buy something with ""striptease"" in the title I expect to come out of it feeling like I learned some beautiful, sexy, graceful stripper moves, not some quick, goofy, jerky, aerobic wannabe nightclub attempts at movement. Another DISAPPOINTING fake striptease workout."
1,Terrible!,I tried this video and I felt like a wannabe cheerleader. To be the dance wasn't at all seductive or even a good workout. A huge waste of money!
2,a little disapointed.,This DVD really didn't make me feel sexy working out or teach me anything that my husband would find attractive. I also really didn't feel like I got a good work out from the DVD. I just felt silly.
5,Great workout,I've been using this DVD for a week. The routines are simple to follow and you definitely get a good workout and feel as sexy as ever!
5,Great video!!,"I love this video!! It is great for the uncoordinated, as they go through each move and then build upon them to make up a routine. Probably designed more for the beginner or someone who is not as comfortable with dance. Which is perfect for me! It is fun and I am going to be looking for more ""Dance off the inches"" videos!"
3,I Fell For It.,Its ok but if I could go back I would. Its only good for lowwwww key working out. Some of the moves are ok but mostly funny. Its like once it starts to get going and get good it stops and goes back to the same steps over and over. The instructor did the best she could with the material. If you want to break a sweat this isnt for you. I will keep this as a keeping in reference tool more than a CARDIO striptease. Beginners striptease mayyybe just without the cardio.
3,Not for family consumption,"Can't do this one with the kids around! Usually they do my workout with me. Moves might actually benefit them, but they don't really need all the talk about sexiness, etc. Otherwise OK workout - a good change."

2,Not Very Detailed,"This movie is about about 50 minutes in length and never really got into any detail. It is arranged nicely, starting with the first day of Passover Week and ends with the execution of Jesus and even raises a few interesting questions/thoughts; but, again, no real detail. Is supported visually by many artistic interpretations of Jesus and the events surrounding his execution and offers insights from theologians/professors. Not overly impressive."
5,Great For Education,"Excellent product, easy to understand how to put together, just wish it was done in English. David Haug"
5,A must-have book for Youth Leaders.,I loved this book. T. Glenn allows the reader to see Youth as he has for the past 16 years. It is a book that captures your attention from the first page to the closing remarks. It is very well written. He has allowed himself to be transparent to the readers showing his strengths and weaknesses. The book is honest and straight from the heart.
1,Cheap plastic threads,Nice looking but comes with cheap plastic threads on the drain. Don't buy if you want quality. This thing is a cheap POS!
5,just what I needed,I had an old briggs push mower that need restored so I found this and it was exactly what I needed. Price was good and it arived quicker than expected so it worked out goo.
3,"Not Paretsky's best work, but not too bad either.","The stories in ""Windy City Blues,"" written throughout Ms.Paretsky's career as a novelist, are not up to her usualstandard, but they are entertaining enough to be worthreading. It has been long enough since a new V.I. Warshawskinovel was published (the last was ""Tunnel Vision,"" 1994)that it just feels good to see these familiar characters again.But don't expect complicated plots: none of these mysteriestaxes Vic's estimable deductive skill much."
1,Ripoff/Short Stories Disguised as Novel/Stories Inane,"The only clue on the front cover of this book that it isnot a V.I. Warshwski novel is a single line reading""V.I. Warshawski Stories."" Discovering that I'd paid $7.00for short stories rather than a novel was a disappointment,and as I started the book, I discovered that the publisherhad double spaced the text to make it appear thatthis was a normal length book. However, the biggestdisappointments were the stories themselves.In the story entitled ""The Pietro Andromache,"" the authorstoops to gathering all of the suspects together in a roomand cleverly solving the mystery! Adult characters in thisawful story actually utter the lines ""Yowie! Zowie! Powie!""and ""Pooper snooper, pooper snooper."" This is one of themost inane stories I've read in years!I have been a fan of this author for a long time, andhave read all of the previous books in this series. Thistime I feel ripped off. I will probably not buy more booksby this author."
4,Love this series,I just started reading this series and got hooked on V.I. I have read thm all now and can't wait for another!
5,Based on the popular book by Jeff Forrester!,"See author Jeff Forrester, reknowned Stooge expert bring his book to life with interviews with Stooge co-workers and families, hilarious anecdotes about the Stooges and trivia questions to keep you guessing! It's a funny hour with a very funny man (Jeff Forrester) and three very funny guys (The Stooges). Filmed on location in Hollywood!"
5,Bring It On......A fun night for Middleschool girls and moms!,"We have a 21 yr. old daughter and a 11.5 yr. old daughter and trying to find a movie for all of us to watch together can be challenging at times. We laughed and had fun together! Our 21 yr. old laughed and smiled and rolled her eyes some but our 11.5 yr. old loved it and wanted to do the cheers and dances in our home,only.A little bit of the language and additude pushed the limits I allow in our lives and home but these movies(Bring It On: Cheertastic 3-Movie Pack)allowed us to have a fun night together! Our 11.5 yr. old had friends over for a sleepover and they had a blast with these movies and popcorn! I don't know how many times they have been played now. I would reccomend this to a parent of a middleschooler or older and especially if the like cheerleading! They are cute,fun,and a value for the cost!"
3,Young but funny,"The local high school cheerleading squad elects a new leader and discovers their past leader was copying other schools routines. Funny movie with good morals for the younger crowd (don;t copy others be original). However you can only stretch this story so far, I think they should have stopped at one. But now I can say I have seen them all!"
3,Love These Flicks,"I haven't watched the third one yet, but the first two I adore. Such a good idea to make it a 3-pack."
3,needs more work but looks great........,"GOT THIS TODAY AND LOOKED GREAT WHEN I PUT IT ON MY IPOD BUT IT KEEP SLIDING OUT THE BOTTOM AND WOULD STAY IN WITHOUT ME PUTTING A SMALL PIECE OF TAPE ON THE BOTTOME. A LATCH DEVICE WOULD HAVE EASILY FIXED THIS PROBLEM PLUS IT DOES NOT HAVE A CLIP ON BACK TO WEAR IT ON YOUR CLOTHES, SO YOU HAVE TO CARRY IT IN YOUR HAND OR PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.....BUT IT DOES LOOK GREAT ONCE ON."
1,What Katy Did Next (EasyRead Edition),"Rubbish!!This was one of my favourite books when I was younger. This edition was a profound disappointment. There were typos on virtually every page and - it's acknowledged in the text - several pages were missing!I will think twice about buying books from Amazon, and particular in EasyRead format, again."
4,Freud TK306,"Bought the blade about 6 months ago for my Rockwell 10"" Contractor Saw. Works great on hard and soft woods. Does a good job on 3/4 Oak veneer plywood. For the price you get a good quality carbide blade that will stay sharp if your a ""weekend"" woodworker"
5,Biotene oral gel for my dog,We used this product on our small dog with bad breath and plaque on teeth. It helped reduce the plaque. Still has some bad breath but there may be a tooth that is bad.
2,Might work but my dogs hate the taste,"Bought this first and they hate it, so I kinda kept forgetting to use it.I can't work if I don't use it. So I bought the water additive and put it in my dogs fresh water everyday and already they have slightly better breath in 1 week. So if you're torn between the two, I'd choose the water additive."
4,Some improvment,"I am pretty happy with the product. I smear a dot on my Chihuahua's gums every night. The gums seem to be less swollen. The biggest improvment is in the color of the gums. Before I started using this gel daily his gums were bright/dark red and now they are a nice pink color. I wish the was a fix it all for Chihuahua's bad teeth, but this seems to help a little."
2,Not a book about henges...,"This is a book focused on the people and history of investigating henges. Who did what to whom when and who got credit. Unless you are fascinated by British archaeological society, this is not your book."
5,You'll love this film even it you hate sports like me,"I love Mathematically Alive! I'm not a sports fan, but heard a lot about the film because my husband is a die-hard Mets fan. It outlines what the different types of fans are by using a sports psychologist which is why I think the film was so successful. This was very clever and really help to put the film in perspective. The stories are great, very interesting, and range from the normal everyday fan to the extreme. I think this is a good film for fans of any team and anyone who is interested in human behavior. Great job!"
1,Disappointment with performances,"Naxos missed the mark with this one. The Caucasian Sketches are the accepted highlights of I-I's work, but the orchesta (sic) of Ukraine simply cannot put it over in either tempo or performance. Too bad, since there is some great music there for the playing."
1,Fun Music..Dismal Performance,"Sadly, the orchestra's performance is mediocre. Major gaffes are heard, and the ""Sardar"" sounds like it was played by a middle school orchestra. Naxos usually has a knack for reasonably good recordings of performances by lesser known ensembles, but not this time."
3,Ippolitov Ivanov,"Very interesting cd, the Russian composer Ippolitov Ivanov deserves more attention for his music which sounds very much like Rimsky-Korsakov. Very difficult to find his music on cd."
1,dont be fooled,"I was mislead by amazon on this - i asked for the soundtrack to ""in the village"" dreams Akiro Kurasaya, this is just the background orchestralI could try for a refund if I spent the money on postage - hardly worth it from Australia, and of course since I just moved I don't have the receipt."
5,nice saw,this is a replacement for a hand me down i had. works very well. i have not had any issues at all.
2,Nice Saw,"I've had this saw for about a year. This is the first band saw I have owned. Everything fit together nicely and have it mounted on mobile base. I also ordered the fence and 6"" riser block. One thing important to remember on any band saw is to use the right kind of blade for the type of sawing you are doing. For example, if you are cutting curves you will probably want to use a narrower blade (1/4"" or 3/8"") with 12 tpi. For resawing, I use a timberwolf 1/2"" 3 tpi blade. This blade is about $30 but makes resawing a pleasure. It's gonna be a little slower cutting then a machine with a 2hp motor but then again the bandsaw is a lot less $ then a lot of the bandsaws out there. If you are a full time professional woodworker you are probably going to want something more robust, if you can afford it. However, for the basement shop(me) or garage shop woodworker it will work just fine. Note: I gave this saw a 5 star rating even though it only shows 2 stars."
3,"Excellent set list, but.....","This live recording was originally a double LP release. The set list is excellent, but unfortunately the live versions aren't quite as good as the original studio recordings. After all, one of Rundgren's strengths is as a producer. As for Back to the Bars, Todd's stage patter can be annoying to me, and his singing can use a bit of restraint in spots. If you have the originals, which I did, then this one is superfluous. What if you don't have the originals, should you start here? I'd recommend the originals, perhaps an anthology, but better yet start getting the albums."
2,Poor sound quality,"Pretty poor live recording by today's standards ( or then ! ) .High points are patchey on this set .Most of the material is very close , in performance , to the studio versions ..... so what's the point ??Just get your studio albums , turn down the treble , and make a clapping-whistling sound between each track .Anyway ... the sleeve IS embarrassing ."
2,Not as expected,These were a Christmas present for my 16yr old son who has recently started playing the drums. Unfortunately one of them split after only a short while of using them. He had to buy another set from a local store to take to his lesson with him. Great looking sticks but rather fragile.
2,My time with drum sticks,These drumsticks look like a good pair of drumsticks when you bye them. On the drumsticks there are black grips for your hands so they do not slip off. The first day I used these the black grip came off. I am very dissoppointed. I do not recomended these drumsticks. When the black grip came off there was wood underneath the wood was still okay so now that is what I use. Again I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMENED THIS ITEM.
5,Neat,So excited to see these. Got for 13 yr old son. He was so excited to see these drum sticks. Who knew they made this?!? He lives them!!!
3,Good way to pass time...,"I'd say the sims online is good and bad...it is a very good way to pass the time.The Good Sides:You get to make your own sim....You can make new friendsMake your own house...(with alot of work)The BAD sides:LAG...LAG...and some more lag...Skilling takes hours to complete from 0.00 to 10.99Money Making is very hardThere is alot of Scammers in TSO , so better watch out...Overall , its 50/50...but I'd sugguest you wait till The Sims 2 (can't wait)Coming September 17th , 2004"
2,Sims Online Beware of Hidden Dangers,"When I first got this game . I loved every minute of itthen something nasty happen . I was inviting people to my partywhen suddenly i was targeted by ""Mafia "" type sims , who thenwith no provcation 'Tagged "" me ie making an enemy out of me , for no apparent reason . Being under 13 , I was pretty scared of this and decided not to come back ......So be careful , try the 14 day trial , I'm glad my dad insisted on thatinstead of buying a subscription ."
4,Bloody Rock and Roll,"This game is the peaches, I love to play every day! I didn't think it would be that fun, but I have come to conclusionm that I will never tire of the game, soooo fun. I love to create relationships with other Sims in THERE. It is fun."
3,No longer worst game I played but still awful,This is nooootttttttt a new game this is the same thing don't let the people eat your brain I am a loyal sims fan I like offline sims the pets and jobs make this game an o.k game not a good game like ever quest try it youll like it for a month theeeennnnnn youll quit
1,Waste of money! Dead game...no online servers up,Nowhere in the description of this game did it say that it is a dead game. There are no online servers to play this game therefore it was a huge waste of money because you can't do anything with it. You can install it on your computer but after that...nothing...Very frustrating! DON'T BUY!!!!
4,Great Compass/Temp Mirror,"This is a great product with awesome features. It is quality made and was easy to install. I would have gave it 5 stars if it was a little wider a mirror. I installed it in an 2008 F250 Superduty truck and the mirror is about an inch narrower than the factory one, which gives quite a bit less of a rear view. In a car or SUV you most liely would never notice. Other than that it is a great well built product."
5,A rearview mirror for any car,"Looking to add some current features to that muscle car? I installed this mirror into my 1972 Chevelle Restomod and I have to tell you it works great. With map lights built in, Temperature and Compass, auto dimming at night, and best of all it looks like it belongs in the car.The original aged mirror with the flip lever day/night and single map light was beyond its years, so I will sell it to another collector who wants original and am perfectly satisfied with this mirror.If you have a glue on window mount, or even if you don't (you can add one like I did) this mirror will not disappoint. You need basic wiring skills to run the wires to the power and the front bumper sensor . Enjoy the latest in auto dimming; his/hers map lights, digital compass and outside temperature. Highly Recommended!"
5,excellent product,I am very happy with the rearview mirror.It is everything they said it would be.All the features are excellent.
4,nothing quite like it,"My adult daughter is a ancient history buff, and she's absolutely loved these books - I got her one every year for three Christmases in a row. The story of Gilgamesh is told in beautiful illustrations with text suitable for reading aloud to a young child. Broaden horizons with a tale that's far more than usual children's fare!"
3,HP #10 INK JET CARTRIDGE,"While the price was very attractive and the cartridge, just installed, prints I'm concerned that it has an expiration date of 2011.."
3,"good content, poor editing","I bought this on the recommendation of two people with much more tuning experience than I have. They both said that it gave the most complete set of tuning advice and I defer to their judgement on that. The editing, however, is terrible.Some sections only cover to Solaris 2.4, while others are updated to cover 2.6. The information in the section ""Stripping on Sun"" is five years old, with the author/editor covering the next generation of product in a new section. It looks like a slipshod update of the original book."
3,An Just-OK book.,"Chapter 1-2 provides lengthy explanation about Unix performance tuning. From DBA's standpoint, I would suggest readers to work closely with SA instead of trying to play SA's role. Read them but do not apply your knowledge without SA by your side!Chapter 3 is a good one.The rest of the books can be skipped if you have read OCP's training material or Oracle8 Backup & Recovery and Performance Tuning.Regarding SQL tuning, I would highly recommend Oracle SQL High-Performance Tuning."
1,"Just because it fits, doesn't mean it works","I decided to get this knock sensor, not knowing that generics don't always work properly. I put in the new knock sensor and now my fuel economy on my 1995 Subaru LSi is extremely worse than it was. It went from 25 mpg to 20 mpg. Do not get this sensor. If you are going to pay this much, you might as well get an actual OEM sensor, which would be calibrated properly for your specific vehicle."
5,Early Kurosawa Gem,"""No Regrets for our Youth"" is probably Kurosawa's first important movie. The setting is 1930's and 1940's Japan. The military has taken control of the country, an event that has a profound impact on the characters in this film. Setsuko Hara gives an outstanding performance as Yukie, the spoiled professor's daughter whose sufferings lead to self-discovery. Some have called this film a feminist drama, a rarity for Kurosawa. But it's also a movie about the choices we make in life. Yukie has two suitors, Itokawa and Noge. She knows she will have a safe but boring life if she marries Itokawa, and a stormy but exciting one if she chooses Noge. I won't give away any more of the plot. But I will tell you the farm scenes will be a real eye-opener for those of you who are familiar with Setsuko Hara's roles as the sweet daughter in films by Yasujiro Ozu."
4,"Freud's TK206,10', 24 tooth saw blade","An excellent saw blade, especially for benchtop or contractor saws. Its thinner cutting profile reduces the work required by the saw without affecting the quality of the cut. The wood will need to be cleaned up on the cut edge,(jointer), but this is a small price to pay when ripping thick hardwoods. It is also one of the lower priced saw blades and Freud only puts out quality stuff. Freud's teflon coated 24 tooth blade, (TK206R, I think, can't find an I.D. on my blade or package), is an even better choice, no pitch to clean. The red teflon really works."
5,Freud TK206 Avanti 10-Inch 24 Tooth ATB Thin Kerf ...,"I just wish I would have found these blades about 20 years ago when I always had to find someone to sharpen my old blades.These blades cut like a hot knive through butter.And they are quite.Also chrome, what more could you ask for."
3,Good rip blade,"The Avanti rip blades do a good job ripping. The reason I rated them 3 stars is because the effort of the blade going through wood. I ripped douglas fir. The blade always seemed to be just a tad bit sticky, meaning I had to put a bit more effort into feeding the boards through the blade. I have useed Freud's red teflon coated blades and have not experienced this with the teflon blades. Overall, a good blade; price is good; but there are better rip blades."
2,Merrimac vs Monitor,"Historically the creation of these two historic maritime vessels was interesting. The romatic and brother versus brother storyline, while probably a reality, was performed pretty hokie. I think James Dunn was miscast for the role. Transistion between scenes was choppy; more like a theatrical play than a movie."
2,Kindle edition has problems,"A brilliant book, but unfortunately the Kindle edition has problems. For example, the Greek letter pi, referenced often in the book, always shows up as a blank square. This makes it difficult to read. I'd expect this kind of textual error with an amateur OCR text, but not in a $10 version."
3,Somewhat lethargic in places!,I find here the approach almost too literal. The orchestra brass are no where near the quality of the Berlin version or the Bavarian Radio version under Jochum. I also find the recorded sound too thin and recessed ....important subjects and repeated motifs are lost in the mix and therefore I find this to be quite far behind the searingly intense approach from conductors like Kempe and Jochum.
2,Very Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this recording which seems to have been well received by others. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by what I heard. Another posted has already expressed my thoughts. I quote:""The entire performance left me bored. I could hardly keep my patience, and almost skipped ahead repatedly. Although I blamed Bruckner, I later found that it was merely a poor interpretation. ""In addition to problems with the interpretation, the orchestra sounded like they had not rehearsed adequately. The recorded sound was dull with poor balance and little hall ambience.I strongly recommend the Horenstein/BBC version instead.George"
2,"Solid, But Lacks Drama and Bite","This effort at the Bruckner 5th was solid, but lacks passion and drama. Usually, the tension and suspense should build throughout a good Bruckner symphony until the finale. Here, the movements seem like separate pieces put together. It struck me as a collection of symphonic poems rather than a symphony. This was a disappointment to me."
2,OK...not great,"You're not going to learn to become a medical translator by using this book. I have 10 years of experience as a medical translator and just wanted to ""brush up"" before taking a certification test. I got this book thinking it would help. It's basically a collection of ""documents"" for you to translate. There are no answer keys and there is no dictionary or any other type of reference. You could just as easily grab some handouts at a hospital or clinic to practice with. If you want to brush up on your interpreting skills, try the ACEBO book/CD."
2,Not Frey's best,"Disappointing, but I read until the end and then laughed at myself for doing so. If you are reading this review to decide whether or not to read this book next - my recommendation is grab another book from your stacks.The storyline is more fantasy (silly) with a splash of romance than thriller. It is unfortunate because the storyline could have been solid with a bit more focus and character development.So many books and so little time - pass on this one unless you have a need to read every book Stephen Frey puts his name to.Two stars."
2,It really is worth only a penn y,Definitely not Freys best but with some judicious skimming you can read it in a few hours. It is down to a penny used on Amazon and alas that is all it is worth.
4,Good Conspiracy Read!,"Conner Ashby is an investment banker employed by the investmentfirm Phenix Capital.He is carrying on an affair with a woman who is engaged to someone else but likes his company.He receives ane-mail that describes a project named Project Delphi.This e-maildescribes financial misdeeds and outright theivery taking place at a company.

A well written story that you will enjoy."
5,marinco trolling motor power connector,"Overall, this product seems to be the best I have been able to find. The last one I installed lasted less then a year before salt water intrusion caused it to be inoperable.The Marinco plug uses an o-ring to keep water out of the receptacle but relies only on a somewhat tight fit ""plastic cap"" to keep water out of the receptacle when the plug is not installed. I feel the use of a more solid cap with an o-ring would have been a better design. Only time will tell how the Marinco product will perform.Anyone who uses their boat in an salt water environment knows what the elements can do to equipment. It is about time that the manufacturers take a more serious account of this fact."
5,Brilliant Piece of Kit,This is a brilliant piece of kit for anyone with a marine application where you have 12 volts and high amps in an external environment were quality and function is of paramount importance.
5,Truly Outstanding,"Locatelli is a lesser known composer from the Baroque era but these compositions are truly outstanding. I have listened to this album many times and have not grown tired of it yet. Allemanda:Allegro from Concerto Grosso No. 9 is the high point of these concertos for me; one of the best I have ever heard. For anyone who is a fan of Baroque music, this album is highly recommended."
5,Works great,My Panasonic drill was been a workhorse in the shop for years - finally the batteries stopped holding a charge. I found this replacement and it works great. Charges in the same charger and makes the drill almost like new - much less expensive then buying a whole new tool.
4,GENUINE PANASONIC LAMP,"MY FIRST ORDER FOR A PROJECTOR LAMP WAS NOT A PLESANT EXPERIENCE. I ORDERED FROM A COMPANY THAT HAD THE BEST PRICE AND AND A 6 MONTH WARRANTY. THE FIRST THING THAT I THOUGHT WAS STRANGE WAS I DIDNT RECEIVE A SHIP NOTICE . WNEN I CALLED AFTER A WEEK,THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD SHIP THE NEXT DAY.THEY DEBITED MY CHARGE CARD THE DAY I OREDERED . A MONTH LATER AFTER NUMEROUS EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS AND A THREAT TO CALL MY CREDIT CARD PROVIDER, THEY AGREED TO REFUND MY MONEY, LESSON LEARNED.CHECK ON THE COMPANTY YOUR ARE DEALING WITH. THIS COMPANY HAD LOTS OF BAD REVIEWS. AMAZON IS A DIFFERENT STORY I SHOULD OF ORDERED FROM THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SAVE A COUPLE OF DOLLARS. I HAD A NEW LAMP IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. INSTALLATION WAS A BREEZE AND MY PANASONIC PROJECTOR IS LIKE NEW AGAIN. I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON."
1,Not the real deal!!!,"This is the 2nd review I have made. The first one never was added to the reviews. I returned the bulb. The company actually called me to rescind my comments and they even sweetened the pot to do so. I said no. My review never got published even after they told me they have no control over what gets published or not. My comments: This was a chinese knockoff, not a Panasonic bulb that this ad implies in its wording. I was really mad that they are trying to sell it as a true Panasonic bulb. They refuse to change the wording so people are taken in. BE ADVISED...THIS IS NOT A PANASONIC BULB, IT IS AN IMITATION!!!"
1,Unreliable replacement lamps,"Amazon has been great and fast at shipping out replacment lamp units. However, the quality of this unit is unacceptable poor.First lamp unit: After 3 hours - the next day... dead.Second lamp unit: DOAThird lamp unit: After 5 hours - the next day... deadThroughout this, the generic replacement lamp (although at 2,500 hours and dim) continues to work without problem.I just give up on the OEM Panasonic. Poor quality, or it just doesn't ship well."
4,Helping hand,"""The Language of Goldfish"" is a novel that at first glance seems a simple story of a young girl who loses touch with reality after her parents decide to move in her difficult teen years. An outsider will probably not understand what it is like to have those moments of losing oneself completely; of having a safe island to turn to when things get too rough; of having the comfort of being able to speak the language of goldfish; of being able to hold on to the familiar in a world of insanity and lies; the keeping up of appearances. This book is very recognizable for those who have once found themselves in a similar situation, perhaps not as drastic as for the protagonist of ""Language of Goldfish"". The theme of learning to deal with reality, having to come to terms with things and being able to lay aside that which is old and no longer of use, can offer a helping hand.A wonderful book of hope!"
4,I liked this book,"I first read ""The Language of Goldfish"" when I was in eighth grade. I liked it. I thought it was written in a unique way. One thing that I don't like about the book, however, is the way her family treats Carrie's problems. They're definitely no help. Her doctor dad dismisses Carrie's problem as anemia and all her mother cares about is having parties. And to make things worse, they're trying to force Carrie to do things she doesn't like to do, like go to school dances. When her mom says that Moira, her older and more social sister, loved the dances, Carrie insists that she's not like her. In other words, they want her to be like Moira, and she's just not. My belief is that if they talked and listened to Carrie more, she wouldn't have these problems and resort to attempting suicide. Nonetheless, I did like this book."
3,The Language of Goldfish,"The Language of Goldfish is a YA novel which portrays the world of 13-years-old Carrie Stokes who suffers a mental breakdown and even tries to commit suicide. Her parents are too busy with themselves too understand the true character of her problem. Carrie is an introvert, hiding her real problems. However, she is pretty intelligent, good at Maths and drawing. Nonetheless, Carrie withdraws herself from the social world. I think, it is a book that you can use in class to talk about such problems and to show that you care. Of course the adolescent years can be a hard time full of struggle. So with three stars you go !"
3,Review The Language of Goldfish,"The Language of Goldfish' is a book about a young teenage girl, Carrie, who doesn't do well in coping with growing up. Her mother is very self-engaged and very pre-occupied with her busy social-life. Her father, a doctor, regards her anxiety attacks as anemia. Carrie's older sister, Moira, never had Carrie's problems and therefor cannot relate to them. When Carrie hits an all time low and tries to commit suicide, she finally gets the help she needs and starts visiting a psychiatrist on a daily basis.I like the book, since Carrie's uncertainties are somewhat recognisable. Carrie is a vulnerable and creative girl. She shows a lot of perseverance when she tries to come to terms with herself.I wasn't too impressed with Carrie's infatuation with the goldfish, this was a little bit overdone in my opinion.Overall, it's a nice book!"
4,Assignment,"I really liked reading ""The Language of Goldfish"" by Zibby Oneal. The only thing I couldn't get a grip on were the goldfish. It's a funny world she created to escape to. I felt sorry for Carrie because she didn't feel she could turn to her mother for help and support. All her mother wanted was to make sure the outside world wouldn't find out about Carrie's problems. Fortunately Carrie has some very nice Saturday mornings with Mrs Ramsay, drawing, which helped her a great deal.Unfortunately these finsh when Mrs Ramsay has to move.The suicide attempts are really screams for help.Well, I hope I've convinced you to read the book, if I did, enjoy it!"
3,good but could have been better.,"I would have given this book 3,5 stars if that was an option but unfortunately it isn't. Although i really enjoyed reading the book, I felt as if it was lacking somehow. I don't know what it is exactly, but I just missed something. Perhaps the end of her illnes felt a bit to easy/ to simplified. But overall a good book which can be a good book to read in a classroom."
4,Book review 'The language of goldfish',"I really enjoyed reading this book and for that reason I rewarded it with 4 stars. The main character of the book, Carrie, is a teenage girl who recently moved to Northpoint with her parents and siblings. Carrie finds it difficult to deal with the current changes in her life. As a result she suffers from dizzy spells. After a horrible breakdown she tries to regain control over her life again.Personally I think many teenagers will enjoy reading this book as it deals with recognizable topics. Often teenagers struggle with radical changes in their lives and many of them experience feelings like being different and not fitting in. A must-read for every teacher (to be)!"
5,Fun and challenging!,The Disney Songbook was a requested Christmas gift for my daughter who has been playing piano for 10 years. Just enough fun with just enough challenge for her.
4,spam reviewer,"J. Green ""socio-economo-ethnomusicologist"" has copied and pasted the same review verbatim for three Ellroy novels (""Scott Turow for the louche set""). While Green may have read one of Ellroy's novels and found it lacking, the review is so bad that it is simply not credible that he or she actually read the other two books reviewed. This amounts to spamming and is not helpful to anyone trying to decide if the books in question are worth reading."
5,"Like everything the greatest living American Novelist writes, SUPERB","Great book that makes you feel like you are on the scene. I have always been a great fan of Ellroy and always will. The man promises to outlive Bill Clinton just so he can write a book tearing that degenerate to pieces (""can't liable a dead man"" as Mr. Elroy puts it). Can't wait for that book to come out........or for its cause for release for that matter.If you like Ellroy or you like well crafted crime novels then you will love this and every book written by the greatest crime novelist this globe has ever produced."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I started reading this twice, but couldn't get to page 100 either time.I realize that mine is a minority opinion among those readers posting reviews on amazon.com, but I found that the novel moved around so much among so many sub-plots that it did not flow for me.Each of the sub-plots seemed was intriguing, but overall I did not find the novel engaging."
4,Wow,"Dudley Smith is one bad, bad man. I'm so glad that he's nearly always a central character, but that we never get to follow his thoughts behind his actions. I cannot see Dud in my mind without seeing James Cromwell, he was absolutely PERFECT for that role. Looking forward to finishing the quartet with the Black Dahlia."
4,A skillful piece of crime drama,"After more than enjoying Ellroy's Black Dahlia and L.A. Confidential, I gripped this book. Maybe it was a tiny disappointment, since the story didn't really get going until I was halway through, but in the end I felt satisfied anyway.Ellroy is really a tough guy, his books are among the most brutal and cynical I've ever read. There is humanity, he seems to say, but it's destiny is always to give way for lust of power and money. A realistic view, truly. The Big Nowhere is maybe even darker than his other books - in the end, all there's left is... well, the big nowhere, and man driving through it, probably heading for his own death. That's what they call existentialism, I suppose. Ellroy has something to say, which is rare nowadays."
4,Better than Black Dahlia,"The plot hangs together better than Black Dahlia and the Red Scare theme is inherently interesting. I think ellroy is too cartoonish to be a great writer, but I do keep reading his books."
2,Couldn't stay with it . . .,"I read ""The Black Dahlia"" and couldn't put it down. I tried to read this and halfway through had to give up. The three main characters (Meeks, Upshaw and Considine) were very interesting but the plot got so convoluted and confusing, I was totally lost. I think Ellory tried to put too many things together in one story and it just ends up a mess."
3,Not his best,"I recently got hooked on this stuff, but I won't keep on reading if I don't have the time, don't like what I'm reading or if it's impossibly tough to cut through. In this case it was a little bit of all three. Additionally I disliked the main character Dave Klein enough, that I abandonded the book. Maybe I'll try it some other time. I have read ""LA Confidential"": a little disappointing, still great ""Black Dahlia"": Great ""The Big Nowhere"": When one of the main characters was killed, I took it really personally! My favorite so far! ""American Tabloid"": Favorite character: ""Big Pete"" Kooky writing style that I really enjoyed. Kept me hangin in until the end. ""Hollywood Nocturne"" Still reading (short stories)"
2,A long tough read.,"As a major fan of Michael Connelly, Robert Crais and Raymond Chandler and the LA they picture, I know I should enjoy James Ellroy. However, he just doesn't do it for me.I have now read three of his novels and doubt I will try any more.""The Big Nowhere"" was too long, tedious and confusing for my tastes.A couple of the main characters were quite interesting and I looked forward to following their escapades. But overall the novel just was too ""over the top"" for me.While I finish the books of Messrs. Connelly, Crais and Chandler in a couple of days, Mr. Ellroy's take me over a week. I do not try to steal time for him as I do those other wonderful writers of crime mysteries set in LA.KVD"
1,Watching the Grass Grow Would be More Entertaining,"The only reason I continued to read past the first few chapters was because Larry McMurtry wrote it. I finally gave up halfway through, deciding it wasn't going to get any better. I'm just glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't pay good money for it."
2,disapointment,"mcmurtry is one of my favorite authors, however this is probably my least favorite book, and i have read all of his fiction (with the exception of the short stories)and most of his non-fiction. extremely weak. so weak that it should be taken out of print - because someone may read it and think that all of his books are this bad. he must have been distracted when he wrote it."
2,Clearly the author doesn't like women,"I hated every woman in the book. After seeing the list of titles from the author I was expecting a masterpiece. I was let down by my expectations. I have never read about women as pathetic as these two. Afraid of leaving LA? Give me a break. The author must have been in a bad relationship and has trust issues. Everyone cheats on each other, all the women are cheaters and no one seems to think its wrong. The only thing missing was the lesbians."
1,Loop Group,"Early on I was an enthusiastic fan of McMurtry, then abandoned him quite a while back because of the declining quality of his works. But the other day,thinking to give him the benefit of a doubt and,in despair over the appalling crap I read every day by a galaxy of people who call themselves writers rather than authors, I picked this book up at the local library reasoning well,it might be, if not good, at least entertaining. Bad move. Ya gotta know when to quit, Larry. This is so awful it defies description. The six women who take part in this messy, unstructured, unplotted ramble are over-age juveniles, drunks, dopers,sexual obsessives, out-and-out bitches; the men merely sketchy unmentionables. I ""read"" this in only one morning, because I skipped more then half the pages in the hope I'd find something of interest. Vain hope! There was absolutely no reason for this book to have been written - by McMurtry or anyone else."
1,A total dog!,"Larry phoned this one in. What a complete and total waste oftime. This book has no redeeming qualities. It's a real dog(no offense to dogs)! I wish there was an option to give zerostars but there isn't, so I had to give it one star."
2,At Least I Finished It,"I think McMurtry should stay out of Hollywood and stick with Texas! It's an interesting aspect of Hollywood life, the loop groups, and I cared enough about the characters to want to finish the book, but I would not buy another McMurty on Hollywood!"
1,Waste of time and energy,Thanks to all who reviewed this book! I suspected it was a waste of time after the first audio tape and your reviews saved me a lot of time!
1,Not what I expect from McMurtry,"I'm a longtime fan of LM's work, especially Terms of Endearment and The Last Picture Show, but others as well. This book focuses on the tawdry sex lives of two over the hill gals who seem to do nothing but talk about sex, seek sex and then wonder why they can't find a ""good"" man! The protagonist has a strange relationship with her three equally lacivious daughters, discusses her sex life with them, shares pot with them...maybe that's the norm in Hollywood? I'm sorry I bought this book....I'm so over crude language and did not expect it from someone with so much talent. It's well written, just not subject matter that interests me."
2,I've Read Better,"i really have mixed feelings about this book....while I liked the part where Maggie and Connie were traveling, the rest of the book really was boring. I was anxious to finish it only to get rid of it. Too bad, could have been a decent book!"
1,Loop Group,I could only read a few pages of this book. Is this the same author who wrote the magnificent Lonesome Dove? (One of my favorite books of all time.) I have a real affection for Larry McMurtry because of this one book---hard to believe the same author came up with Loop Group.
2,Disappointment,"I love so many of Larry McMurtry's books, but this one disappointed me. One thing I thought he had a special ability for doing was to make you feel something for the characters. I did not even like, let alone love, or hate any of the characters except Aunt Cooney, and she was brushed over and gone before you even got to know her. Everyone else was so shallow you wonder why anyone would write a book about them at all."
1,No Reason to Read This Book,How could an author capable of great works put out such drivel? So many reviewers mention that they kept reading this book since it is by McMurtry. My wife and I sat through half of it for the same reason and because it was our only book on CD for our frequent 9 hour drive to Oregon. Save yourself this agony.
1,Sub-par,"Don't waste your money! This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I kept reading hoping it would get better but the ending was as bad as the rest. I normally love Larry McMurtry's writing, especially the historical novels - which is what he should stick to! Instead of adding this book to my collection by this author, this is going straight to the used book store - although even he may not be interested in adding it to his shelves."
1,Terrrible,I borrow the audio book from the library I could not get pass the first chapter the voice was just terrible.
1,Did he get paid by the word?,"McMurtry's writing is wonderful, as always. What a shame he has nothing really to say."
3,Useful Insights,"Actually it is true, a lot of the book is a rehash of common Windows security practices that is way overdocumented, e.g. how many times must we redocument the simple tool Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer. However, interspersed between the rehashed material are useful insights.I only wish there was coverage of topics like Windows Firewall or ICF within a Windows security book. I thought that topic would be of import for any security book."
5,the very efficent carpenter,"This is a very informative book about home building. The book was written by Larry Haun, one of the best builders of all times. Some of his tips and tricks have been used by carpenters world wide.This book reflects his attitude about building and life. He has past away and will be missed."
1,"Does not fit Jet JWBS-140S 14"" band saw sold by Amazon","My new Jet JWBS-140S / 708113 14"" band saw with open stand arrived 2 days after the HTC HSJ-1414 mobile base had arrived. I ordered the Jet band saw and mobile base at the same time, from the same page on Amazon, as the accessories were listed below the 14"" band saw. Once assembled, the base of the band saw measured approx 19.5"" by 22.5"" and would not fit in the HTC HSJ-1414 mobile base which measured approx 18"" by 27"". I am waiting to see what Amazon decides on this. I may have to return the whole lot as I need to be able to move the saw out of the way.See also my review on the Carter Jet 14 saw guide, which does not fit the new 14"" Jet band saw."
2,Nice Looking,The ring looked exactly as it did in the picture. But for Sterling Silver - I didn't expect that it would turn my boyfriend's finger green.
2,Walton Concerto,"I personally think this isn't the best recording of the Walton concerto. I would recommend Nigel Kennedy's recording-his intonation is flawless, his phrasing very musical, and he produces the best sound for the Walton concerto. These things were a bit lacking in this particular recording. As far as the Symphony and overture, I must admit I bought the cd mainly to hear the concerto."
2,"Problems, problems","I ordered this with the JWBS-14OS saw (see also) and the kit came with a 22mm upper guide bar extension which did not fit the 19mm holes in the upper frame and upper guide. It took 5 weeks, 4 calls to WMH, and the receipt of three more 22mm guide bars before they could get me the right part.On the plus side, no problems with frame/wheel alignment as reported by other reviewers.On the minus side, the guide block does narrow the throat of the saw about an inch, and (at least the 3/4 hp 14OS) is underpowered for resawing so I am not convinced that the extra 6 inches cutting capacity is all that useful. also,getting that big bolt tightened inside the frame is tough, you can't use an adjustable wrench."
2,Come on JET!,"I've had my Jet Band-saw for many years. But the engineering on the riser and the instructions are quite bad! The diagram pictures the blade guard on the left side going on backwards? The base holes were not tapped, and I had to ream the dowel pins on the base. Now I know it's been on the market for literally years but come on! I decided to use an old computer A.C. cord and replace the motor cable and put the switch back where it was vs lowering it. You either need to have some self tapping screws on hand or some taps. Like I said I reworked mine to extend the power cord drop!I needed new blades so I figured what the heck. It just took 2 hours instead of 45 minutes. At least it was a good opportunity to really clean the band-saw! It's a tool and were supposed to be handy right!Saw On!Bill"
5,Works Like a Charm,"The fit and finish is a perfect match and the added height is great for re sawing. The install was easy and quick, now all I have to do is convince my wife that I need a new set of blades, wish me luck."
5,Riser Block Great Quality,The riser block installation was very straightforward. The parts were well-packaged and the instructions were thorough. The blade that comes with the assembly is sized correctly but not of the quality one would probably want to use long term. I purchased 105 inch Timberwolf blades and installed one of them when I installed the riser block. This really adds a nice capacity to my Jet bandsaw that I did not have before.
1,Still no riser block,"Wish I could give an honest review of the actual product...don't let that disclaimer of shipment in 1 to 2 weeks fool you!!! I ordered mine on May 19th and as of today, July 8th, no riser block. Amazon continues to delay shipment every couple of weeks with an estimated delivery date now of sometime at the beginning of August. You would think that with the Jet bandsaw as one of their better sellers, they would keep a good number of these on hand. I am about to take my business elsewhere!"
5,Cat vs Cat,Desparately needed this book. Ordered this and Starting from Scratch. Started both. Seem worthwhile. Arrived in a timely fashion. Meow.
5,Easy read with good advise,This is a well written book that is an easy read and has much good advise to offer. A real insite in to a cat's world.
2,My cat peed on this book,"We have a blended cat family. They got along ok, not fabulously, until my husband's cat chased and badly scratched my youngest cat. After that it has been neverending stalking, chasing and fighting between those two cats. Worse, my cat started to have litter box issues.I turned to this book in hopes that I might be able to do something besides repeat the time and labor intensive introduction process, but this book offered me nothing except a few new tidbits of information that weren't applicable to my situtation.Oh, and I guess my cat didn't like the book. He peed on it."
4,a good book for cat owner's,"I have multifamilies cats in my house, and sometimes it's a little bit hard to live with them. In this book I could understand a lot of signals that my cats gave to me. An useful book!"
2,more general information than multiple cat info,"Regretted buying this book, because it just wasn't very useful. There is one chapter on multiple cats and I was familiar with all of the information in it. Most of the rest of the book is general cat advice which again I knew most of and did not address my many questions about introducing a new cat and the new cat - old cat interactions. I feel the title is quite misleading given how little of the book is actually devoted to ""cat vs. cat."" I do own her other book - Think like a cat - which I did find useful for general cat advice. Perhaps if I had not read that one I would have found this one more useful."
3,New Cat at Home,I did get a few helpful tips on bringing a new cat into the home. However this did not at all address the situation of when the new cat is the agressor.
3,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed after reading this book because it didn't solve one single issue I have with my three cats. They were all introduced properly but yet one of them has a tendency to play fight with the other two but they're too laid back to play. This book may be helpful if you have multiple cats who are very domineering but for the most part, I'd just get this book at the library and save your money."
5,Fabulous Book-Great Help to my Home,I received this book as a gift after expressing to my friend my frustrations with my two cats getting along. It has been a great help and we are slowly implementing new techniques to help them get along. I have learned so much about my cats behavior that I was previously misinterpreting. This is a must read before adding a cat to your home!
5,The Author Has a Useful Perspective,"This author has developed a good ability to perceive life from a feline perspective, therefore noticing things that we would have otherwise looked over. Her advice and training methods are sound and good."
4,Good Cat Info,This is a great little book full of information on cats. It has especially good information for introducing a new cat into the household. It's a must have in order to avoid commom mistakes most of us make when bringing a new kitty home.
4,Cat Advice,"For anyone who is thinking of introducing another cat into a home where your not sure how things will go, or sure how to go about introducing a new cat should get this book. I bought this book for my husband to read, since i was trying to explain how these tatics work- I thought it would be easier for him to read/see it for himself. I work with cats myself and could say that alot of these methods seem like common sense but when you try to explain to people who want to adopt a new cat and are having trouble with the new addition, this book helps you with understanding how the cat thinks and how you go about getting multiple cats to coexist."
3,not the best cat book ever...,"It's OK, but as a cat owner all my life I have as much insight as the author does regarding pecking order, behaviours etc. Also she is really writing about cats who never go outdoors so relies heavily on ""cat trees"", structured play, and other stuff indoor/outdoor cats would be baffled by. It's a good guideline book but not very useful for anyone who already knows cats well."
3,One size doesn't always fit all.,"Good discussion but not everything applied to my cats, especially in the section that translated behavior/signals"
3,Cat vs. Cat,"More information that I ever dreamed of. If one follows her suggestions it would take an incredible amountof time and energy to bring a new cat into the house where there are already one or more cats. Ultimately,I decided my kitty would be an Only Child!"
4,Great book for insight into how cats think,This is a terrific book that gives great insight into the thinking of cats and how they interact. It has been helpful for me.
3,"isn't ""THAT"" great","come on boys and girls... This song isn't that great? A club hit? hardly.. just because something goes on the radio doesn't make it a club hit. System F - Out of the Blue, DJ Tiesto - Sparkles, Zombie Nation - Kernkraft 400... now those are club hits.. but are they getting all the acclaim this song is? Noooo.. why because it's on the radio. This song will definately blow over in 3 months. If you want to blow your money on this song at least have a mixer so you can mix this with other tracks like Klubbheads or something."
5,The BEST,This is the best techno/electronica song ever! It is really repetetive but you dont get bored of it. Just listening to it makes you want to start dancing. I love this and I cant wait to hear the rest of Darude's cd! BUY THIS!!
4,Tranceperation,Anthemic and inspiring. I usually dont like trance but this song truely makes my heart soar.
5,The Scarlett of the Revolutionary War.,"This is a great book of the life of Caty Greene, the wife of Nathaniel Greene. She was the Scarlett OHara for the Revolutionary War. Winter Quarters with her husband and some of the other Generals and Geo. Washington. Men loved her, and women hated her. She was the life of the party. A great read."
4,A revolutionary lady with spunk!,"Caty was the young wife of Gen. Nathanael Greene. Not content to stay home with the children, she joined her husband in winter quarters at Monmouth NJ (where she gave birth to one of their sons) and Valley Forge PA. The author wrote this biography based on their letters."
1,Sanding Disc,"The ""self stick"" was all dried out and will not adhere to my 12"" sander.I think maybe the ""PSA"" stands for ""Please supply adhesive"""
2,WHO IN THE HECK USES BUTTON FLY'S ANYMORE,FIRST OFF THE SELLER WAS GREAT AND REFUNDED OUR MONEY RIGHT AWAYTHAT HAVING BEEN SAID THESE THINGS SMELLED LIKE DIESEL OR SOMETHING THEY ALSO HAD REALLY BIG BUTTONS ON THE FLY NO ONE MENTIONED THAT IN THE DESCRIPTION OR I DID NOT SEE IT
2,Ok read,This book was slow at times. It is not one of my favorite Cookson novels. The story was a bit extravagant bordering on incredible.
2,A disappointing Gaiam production,"This is the first Gaiam yoga video that has disappointed me. The workout is a short 20 minutes. The actual workout is OK and it flows well and quickly, but the narration is poor. The audio is a few seconds delayed so that the instructor is ahead of what is being described. If the verbal instructions were unclear, I would look up at the TV and she would be on the next pose already. This is something that should have been corrected before releasing the tape. This just isn't up to the standards of the other Gaiam yoga tapes."
3,Vague description,I had checked out a similar book just called TItanic at the library which is series of arrangements of the main (Celine) song. Instead the one I purchased is a compilation of all the background music and the main song at the end. If there had been a list of the titles or a way to preview I wouldn't have bought.
2,Replacements are of inferior quality,I have a full original set of Dansk Concerto Allegro dishes from 2001. These replacements were clearly inferior to my original set. The color was slightly off which can be expected but the weight and quality of finish were really off. The salad plate had minor ripples in the finish.If you are putting together a full set of dishes these might be okay for some people who don't know to expect different. I returned them.
1,12 Bugs,"I purchased this book as a gift for my grandson whose nickname is Bug. We were very disappointed when it arrived to find that the cover was torn and bent up at the binding. This is not a good thing for an infant who will be holding onto the book, reaching for it, and having it read to him. I don't know if it was the packaging that was responsible for the tear or if the book is just not of good quality, but I would not recommend buying this book."
4,Son likes this,"I gave this to my son early before christmas. He loves it and will read it to himself. He did manage to rip some of the angels off the last page within a few minutes. Other than that, it's nice and larger size than the other books."
4,A Buggy Christmas!,"I've been collecting pop-up books for several years now and am trying to purchase as many as I can of David Carter's Buggy Pop-up Books! They are absolutely great for children, so colorful ... but I'm, of course, collecting them for myself. My grandchildren are too old for them so I'm waiting for my great-grandchildren to enjoy them!"
3,Balto,I entered fifth grade reading level and this book was listed so I ordered it. When it came I realized it was not a 5th grade level at all.
5,Very nice performance and recording,"I heard one of the oboe concertos on the radio and liked it, so began looking for a recording of it. This one includes not only three of Handel's oboe concertos, but other music that is also well performed. I enjoy this CD very much, and would recommend it."
3,Book for (very advanced) modellers - a toughie!,"A very technical book, fascinating but not for the faint hearted - this is modelling the academic way. The book leads you through the seven types of variables necessary to elicit each 'stage' of behaviour and a behaviour may have many stages. It requires a dedicated approach to learning all this new elicitation methods and really guts you out in the last few pages. Why? Because after showing you how to elicit modelling variables which, admittedly is quite exciting, it tells you that there is not enough room left to talk in depth about installation of behaviours - and suggests another book - Know How! (which by, the way doesn't explain itself that clearly either). If you know the basic TOTE method this is a good book to cannabalise elicitation questions from - otherwise it requires more dedication than I am prepared to give it."
2,"OOOHH MY GOD, THIS BOOK MELTED MY BRAIN","I consider myself (as do others) to be a well read individual that understands new concepts quickly. How can you possibly get through this book without wanting to physically harm yourself or verbally abuse the authors for subjecting you to such verbose caca mess. Leslie, babe, let's model the acroynm KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and then write a book. Great gift for that special someone who has WAY TOO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS!"
5,Replacing my well-worn vinyl copy,"Despite the long delay and higher price, I went ahead and ordered this from Amazon so I can replace the record I have had since I was in college. I don't know why Joybringer is listed as a ""bonus track"" when it was included on the original LP, but as long as it's on the CD I'll be happy. I can't recommend this music highly enough."
4,"Skills, Skills, Skills","These women could hang in the rap game of today easily. These artists show a tremendous amount of skills and wit in there rhymes. They show a ""take the bull by the horns"" type attitude and they flow on time to the beat. The best part of these rhymes is that they have a messege in between the boasting and don't even curse while doing it. If your a beat oriented type of person you won't miss with this, Lots of hot beats, cuttin' and scatching the way rap music ought to be. Cuttin' and scratching and consciousness is something that is almost absent in today's rap music, an element that I feel really leaves rap songs of today kind of empty. This album has the whole package. The lyrics, consciousness, beats and the skills of the DJ. which makes it enjoyable to listen to. Women rappers should never be under estimated, If you got skills you got skills, period."
4,Nice Fit,"I liked the shoes, they look nice, my only concern when I first received them was the quality of the cover leather, at the begining it looked like plastic. But otherwise they fit perfectly!"
4,"Good, but really short","This version has three songs: Lebanese Blonde (which needs no introduction to Thievery fans), Coming From the Top (a longer version than on DJ-Kicks, and is a good song with a great horn line that sounds ideal for waking up to), and Lebanese Blonde - Instrumental (basically just the album version with the vocals taken out, and a Spanish guitar line playing the vocal melody). This is good if you can find it, but is only about 15 minutes total. If you can, find the French 8-song version. It has these tracks, plus some other hard-to-get ones."
3,First Concert for SNC - You may want to pass on it,"Full disclosure here - I am a big fan of SNC, but this concert just was not impressive.This was their first one, and suffered for the lack of stage space and the style of filming (it was a PBS special).Their music as always is great, but seeing this concert did not add anything, with the one exception of the Christmas Can Can choreography.If you have seen them live (I have!) in the last year or two, you will be disappointed visually.Don't be misled, only the last third of the show was Holiday songs ( and by far, the best selection).What I likedTheir music and soundWhat I didn't likeVisually boring - too much time spent spanning the audience. I think the camera man might have had a thing for the couple of girls up front, stage right, since it panned there quite frequently during the show."
3,Not Bad!,"Likeable characters make this movie better than ok. It falls somewhere between the tepid politically correct WIP movies and the sleazier, raunchier counter parts, all while attempting (and failing) to capture the feel of the WIP movies from the '50's. The dialogue is so so. The (clothed) lesbian mutual masturbation scene is provocative; but it's the charisma of the actresses that keep this movie from being a complete dud. I really like the actress (Starina Johnson) who played the protaganist. Hope to see her in other features in the future."
1,they sent the wrong thing so don't bite on this one,they sent the wrong thing so don't bite on this onethey sent the wrong thing so don't bite on this one
4,trap review,Heavy construction and easy to use. Very happy with free shipping and good price. Looks as though the trap will last a long time with no trouble.
3,"Good price, poor design","What this booklight has going for it is that it's cheap and lightweight (although there are lights that will fold up smaller, while this one just kind of flops around when you try to pack it--but it's small enough that you can pretty much just stuff it wherever). Another plus is that the clip is gentle enough for paperback books.There are two problems with this light. First, it's not very bright except for in the very center, meaning that it requires constant adjustment even on a small mass market paperback. Second, the gooseneck is loose enough that it refuses to stay in one place. I found myself having to actually hold the light in place with one hand.Verdict: This light is cheap, but it's a pain to use. I'm looking for a replacement."
2,Two problems,"There are two problems with this light, and for me they are ""deal breakers.""One, the light is too focused and does not cover the page, so you have to keep moving it as you go down a page. This is unlike the Mighty Bright light that I bought as Asia Books in Thailand.Two, the clip is designed so that when you use it, the two sides of the clip do not come flush to the surface of the pages, so that the point of contact is VERY SMALL; this makes it insecure on the page.I got the Might Bright light because this one was too frustrating, mainly because of the narrow focus of the light."
3,Great light spoiled by poor screw,"I've now had two of these lights. Excellent for reading, no complaints there .... so much so that I bought a second. I had to do this when I couldn't replace the batteries any more because the Philips-head screw had failed, was just mangled, couldn't get it out. Now the same thing has happened on the replacement. I shan't be buying a third."
3,Has pros and cons,"I needed a night light to read without bothering others so I tried this one.Pros:1) Bright enough, has a lot of LEDs.2) Arm is very adjustable.3) Light (not heavy).Cons:1) Lights fade after reading 15-20 mins because the lithium batteries are not strong enough. If this came with AAA batteries then it'd be perfect, but then it'd be too heavy.Because it's so light and tiny to carry around and so bright for it's weight, I've kept this to use around the house."
3,Is there a low and a high position on the switch?,"I find the reading light to be very bright, too, and have to be careful not to disturb my wife when I'm reading in bed late. I notice that the slide switch to turn on the light seems to have two stops, and I wonder if the light is supposed to be dim at the first stop and bright on the second?"
2,Not bright enough & a floppy neck,"My title should say it all. Aside from the affordability, there are no other features I like. It only lights very centrally which means constantly adjusting and the neck is too floppy and will not stay in place or pointed where I want. Too bad since it was so affordable."
1,Not bright enough only lights up small area,I am so disappointed with this booklight. I thought I had gotten one with a dud battery (Lithium CR)so I spent $4 buying a new battery only to find it uses TWO of the batteries not one and it made no difference which means other reviewers are right - it has a hot spot and then fades out. I have even found myself moving the head over each line as I read to be able to see. That is just terrible! It's just not bright enough. I am going to make one attempt to remove the LED light bulb cover to see if that helps but if I can't do it without breaking it - I'll put it in the drawer until the next yard sale. I won't order another booklight online. I will spend a bit at the bookstore to make sure I get something that actually lights up the page. I can't imagine what you could use this for but certainly not reading.
5,Hard Edged Instrumental Funk,"If the raw funk of band like The Meters and Mandrill wiggle your booty, you'll really dig the quasi-instrumental funk of super rhythm section, The Nite-Liters. Best known for their funky disco hit ""K-Jee"" from the soundtrack to Saturday Night Live... 'dat ain't even the start of it. An ultra-percussive funk band... the grooves are wicked and not for the light of heart. Heck, with tunes with titles like Seranade for a Jive Turkey and Pee-Foul -- can you really go wrong on this little Ditty, bro ?Keep an eye out and pray ""Analysis"" gets itself reissued sooner or later which has an ultra bumping version of the ultimate soul groove ""Valdez In The Country"" ! ! !"
5,Fantastic,"Jeff McFadden is a world class performer. Having seen him play live several times and after studying privately with him, I can honestly say he is a master guitarist, teacher and musician. I would very highly reccomend this CD as an introduction to Jeff McFadden and also for what Canada has to offer!!!!"
4,New band sound!,"I love Titanic. I love their first two releases with the original vocalist. I had not heard anything about a new vocalist before getting this release, so when I popped it in I was taken back by an unfamiliar sound. I missed the old Titanic vocalist sound.However, after the shock wore off, and I listened a few times, I found this to be a very hot release of superb power metal. Shredding guitars, powerful vocals, and excellent production...this CD is excellent. I just wonder if it would have been a beter idea to release it under a different band name for us Keith Miles (Simon) fans.So, a very excellent CD on it's own...just not what I was hoping for with the Titanic name."
3,Good but...,"I read Altered Carbon and liked it a lot, as it's kind of an updated Phillip Marlowe detective noir. Broken Angels is different, more of a true sci-fi novel. Good story, inventive imagination on display again, some neat weird stuff a la China Mieville. But. For some reason. Morgan writes. Like this. Throughout the book. And. It is. Very annoying. I can figure out my own phrasing, thanks. And having everyone. Talk like. Capt. Kirk. Distracts from. The narrative. So I'm taking off a star for unnecessary gimmickry. Hopefully Morgan will rediscover the comma in the next book."
3,Broken 'Broken Angels',"I am not sure what Richard was thinking when he wrote this one. After the wonderful violence of the first novel, this novel dares us to try and follow the train of thought of the author. Thank goodness he went back to delightful killing in the third book."
3,Hmm ... Disappointing,"I read Altered Carbon, and found Morgan's style impressive. When I bought this book, I was hoping for more of the same. But I was disappointed in the end.The only thing that is the same is the level of graphic violence - VERY high. This is not a story for the faint of heart.I was simply not happy with this novel. Some of the suspenseful areas seemed overly contrived. There was a little excitement in the story, but nowhere near enough to keep me interested.The biggest problem is that it seemed to be severely lacking in logic. I kept telling myself ""you've GOT to be kidding - this is ridiculous - they can't keep doing this!"""
3,Great but...,"Having purchased and read both ""Broken Angels"" and ""Altered Carbon"" based on recommendations and reviews here, I feel compelled to offer this. I found both books tense, original, and well written, however the author seems committed to including very explicit sex scenes that strike me as unnecessary and graphic to the point of pornography. Usually I pass on books to friends and my teenage children. These won't make the rounds and I'm honestly wondering if I'll even keep them in my collection. Too bad - Richard Morgan is an excellent writer otherwise with tremendous insight and compelling ideas."
2,"Good ideas, lackluster style.","I really wanted to like this novel. It's premise of a hard nosed, high tech protagonist in a future society layered with equally high tech and poly-moral antagonists (and aliens) promised a fun ride not unlike that of Neal Asher's Polity universe series. The great ideas and settings, however, did not make up for the disjointed writing style. Also, for some reason the punctuation in the kindle version seems completely messed up. There are way to many ""."" in any average sentence. If that was on purpose, then this author needs a punctuation lesson. If it is an error due to conversion to digital format, it needs to be fixed. Morgan needs to read a little Neal Asher to see how this kind of story is done right. However, I see tremendous potential."
3,Good enough,"Let me first say that if I had a teenage daughter or son, I wouldn't give this to him or her to read. This book--and almost all of the concepts, moral issues, and events in it--is definitely for a mature audience only. So keep an open mind while reading, and try to keep a firm hold on your own sense of what is right and wrong.Story-wise, it's not as riveting as the first book (Altered Carbon). But it kept my interest, and led me to put the third installment of the series on my wishlist."
2,I could barely finish it ...,"A big disappointment after Altered Carbon. Some serious editing and re-writing was in order here. The writing style, which seemed consistent with the detective mystery plot of Carbon, gets down right annoying in this dragged-out treasure hunt. There are a few exciting & memorable chapters, but my main recollection of this book is the middle 50% spent at the archeological dig, during which the plot barely moves. The characters are not particularly appealing, and the setting is just dismal. Hopefully Morgan tightens things up considerably in the next Takeshi Kovacs novel."
3,More 25th century crime,"The continuing adventures of Takeshi Kovacs. Just like ""Altered Carbon,"" the story involves graphic sex, violence and corporate greed. Also like the first book, it's a quick, engrossing read and enough surprises occur to keep the reader guessing. However, I had to knock a star off the review due to the author suddenly. Putting periods. At random. During numerous conversations. It was. Quite. Irritating. He also ended a few sentences with two exclamation points!! I was always taught that one exclamation point is all a writer ever needs to use!! Despite these two annoying factors, the book is worth picking up."
5,As amazing as the first effort,"The first novel in this series, Altered Carbon, set up the story in Broken Angels. This writer has an amazing ability to mix prose and brutality, thoughtful introspection and all out mayhem. Scary what resides in our heads!!!"
2,Re-heated Gibson.,"Morgan is billed as a next-generation Gibson, but, to me, he came off more like a sci-fi Tom Clancy. The story is basically a video game plot with lots of unimaginative 'war porn' set on a colonial world as a group of mercenaries try to figure out abandoned Martain technology. The characterizations are also video game like; the main protagonist is especially strange, as he's a genetically-modified warrior who is apparently a sociopathic killer, but he spends the entire novel having existential and emotional crises.If you like reading cliched descriptions of interstellar war, you'll like this, but you are probably better served playing Halo or Doom 3."
3,not as interesting as altered carbon,I just didn't like it as much. I stopped caring what happened a couple times near the end.Is takeshi's last name a nod to the watchmen?
2,Interesting but detached,"I like space operas and even have time to read about futuristic dystopias, but this story was cold and couldn't decided if it wanted to revel in or condemn the violence that dripped from every page.There are some interesting ideas and if you like your science fiction hard and brutal you'd probably enjoy this though."
3,Overpriced for what it is.,"Seriously don't know what they think they are doing. I had to get the book elsewhere. If you know where to look, it's $7 elsewhere. It's a bit slower than the first, but faster than the second, and way overpriced."
3,"Good, but not the best of the Kovacs series","I'm being a little tough on Mr. Morgan with only a 3 star review, but having read the other novels in his Takeshi Kovacs series, the bar has been set very high, and this has become my new favorite SF universe. The characters, the technologies, the mystery of the 'Martians', the progression of human history - it's a fantastic and yet seemingly plausible universe, and I guess that's why it really captures my interest. That and Richard Morgan's breathless first-person narrative pacing and vivid characterization. It's a fun and entertaining read, but not quite as relentless in its pacing and less dense with cool cyperpunk (that word seems so dated now) tech than the other Kovacs books. I can't wait for the next one though - and when is someone going to make a movie from one of these?"
5,Nothing going on. But the war.,"What if you're a runaway secret agent, really, really, really tired of the war. Then some geek tells you he's found a genuine Martian artifact leading to a spaceship. What would you do?Annoyingly, as you set out to recover the spaceship, there's just a little bit of sabotage. And there's the war, still. And then there's the spaceship. And you uncover something of why the Martians have abandoned space as you know it.It's Takeshi. Taking the lead. Uncovering a big secret. Trying to find a way out of war, only to discover there's been little change since the Martians left. No change, really. There's still a war..."
4,"Terrific Follow-Up to Altered Carbon, and a Great On-Going Character","Many SF authors come up with an ""invention"" around which they base their stories, societies and future histories, but I'm hard-pressed to name one who has done a better job than Morgan has done in this and Altered Carbon. He developed his personality transference idea quite thoroughly, and built a rich and detailed universe around it. Then, he threw in a hard-boiled tough guy straight out of 40s noir, and wrote a couple terrific tales.A well-paced, well-conceived and well-written book, with a character that will surely draw me back for more."
4,"Blood, body fluid and silicon","This is the second book in Richard K. Morganfs Takeshi Kovacs series. Extremely convenient for the author, the basis for this series allow the hero, Takeshi Kovacs to be resleeved to any body, in any place, at any time. This give the author a lot of rooms in creating a sequel after a sequel, and I am actually looking forward to them. In this particular sequel Takeshi Kovacs is resleeved to be a mercenary. The setting also changes drastically from a Philip Marlowe-like detective story to a John Carpenter-directed Kellyfs Heroes meets Stargate SciFi war story. Again the story is filled with violence, sex and more violence. Donft expect the characters to have any depth. But still I just couldnft figure out Kovacsf emotional attachment to his resleeved team of the warriors versus his unreasonable brutality to his mercenary comrades. But thatfs OK. This story is not about a human value, but about silicon and blood."
2,Sacrificed story to push personal beliefs,"Often lecturing, at times overbearing, this could have been a good story except for the excessive page count devoted to educating_ us, repeatedly, into the ""Way Things Should Be"".What was subtly done in Altered Carbon has become excessive here, often devolving into Socratic style lectures complete with chorus. Battered and weary from the constant monologues, I gave up ess then halfway through the book.Morgan can take his place alongside other drum beaters such as Gerrold and Ringo whose egos have gotten away from them."
2,Why compelling?,"Some other reviewer found this book ""dark and compelling"".I own up to the capital sin of having bought and read this book without having read the first volume, Altered Carbon.However, I am afraid this does not make me believe any of the situations depicted in this book. It is not so much the gratuitous violence, probably a marketing gimmick, as the cardboard characters which are anything but three-dimensional: I cannot help thinking I am actually reading a manga (and I am not very fond of manga, either)...Character seem to move about aimlessly, without any obvious drive. One wonders why do they act like they do.The plot is not that interesting either, with the usual devices:1. just in time;2. people are not what they seem to be;3. a hero will overcome most difficulties.I read it through with lots of effort, as if I just wanted to get done with it.No, this is not a masterpiece, nor is original, nor funny, nor anything one might possibly wish to read."
2,Disappointing sequel,"Altered Carbon introduced some interesting ideas. It was gory, but there was some decent characterization. This one is just fight scene after fight scene. Characterization is poor, plotting is poor, and there are too many ""twists"". A lot like the second Amber series in that sense; it gets hard to suspend your disbelief, and leaves you not caring what happens in the end."
2,Mediocre at best,I read this based on a review in Entertainment Weekly. I have little to add that the review by M. S. Hillis has not already said. My only comment is that I did not read the first book by this author and now have no reason to do so....Scott
5,My favorite Forqueray,"I'm amazed at the negative review below, because I find the instrument played on this recording quite adequate, even excellent. Compared to Meyerson, Luc Beausejour is much more sensitive to the scores and his playing overall is impeccable. Too bad it's out of print; I'd buy it used if necessary."
3,Just average,"These cookies are hard and crunchy and definitely resemble the store-bought cookies made in mass production bakeries. The taste was good, and the texture similar to somthing from Keebler or another large food processor and baker. I expected these cookies to be more like the gluten-free chocolate chip (or chunk) cookies from Pamela's. Pamela's I would rate with five stars. Overall the Kinnikinnick brand would be fine for kids who want a snack, but gourmet they are not."
3,Not very chocolatey,"These are kinda bland tasting and not very much chocolate flavor. Sort of a gluten free ""Chips Ahoy"". I think their are better GF cookies out there (like Pamela's) but my husband ate them all."
2,Taste good but,"they are VERY crumbly and fragile. They are more solid if you keep them in the freezer and eat them that way. Not your typical tough ginger snap texture at all, which could be a good thing. At least half didn't survive amazon packaging and came smashed to bits. Definitely worth trying, but maybe bought from a store, not from amazon."
3,flavor just okay,"Cookies look good, taste is almost non-existent. I vote for PAmela's Chocolate chunk cookies over these. Unfortunately, Pamela's cookies include only NINE in a package. Pricey."
5,Great!!,"My 10 year old son loves these! Not as good as regular chocolate chip cookies, but great for gluten free!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,I had this card less than a week for my new digital camera. It lost about 50 pictures and the card could not be formatted. Basically it was worthless after 4 days. Glad I tested it before taking pictures of my daughter's birth with this piece of garbage memory stick.
2,A lame duck card,"I purchased the 1gb Lexar card, and 5 hours after I started using it, I've got corrupted data that no amount of formating or data deletion will remedy. Given that I had already disceted the box into small pieces to send in for mail in rebates, I contacted Lexar and sent it to them on a Warrenty claim [cheaper then driving back to the retail location I purchased it at anyway].I got it back yesterday, and it was suffering the same problem I sent it in for in the first place!Their solution, they pay for the return shipping of card #2, and swap it out for two 512mb cards.Not happy. But at least they are somewhat responsive to fixing the problem."
5,I needed this instantly.,"Very fast delivery, fantastic price, perfect condition. I would have rated sooner but now the system is easier to rate things so I am at it hard for those who need to hear from real people. Buy it!"
5,Digital Memory Card- value for your dollar!,Works great for far less money than other photo store cards. Thanks for helping me to save money!!
5,Lexar 1 GB Secure Digital Memory Card,Product was as described and shipped in a timely manner. Packaging for shipment was very good. Product lives up to expectations for what it was purchased for.
3,"Fast on read, slow on write","I returned this one the day I got it from Amazon. It was fairly fast when reading from the card, but writing was very slow. Although my Palm T3 showed the card to be from unknown manufacture, its performance numbers suggested it was likely made by Toshiba (Lexar resells other people's products). While Toshiba SDs are reliable, they are known to be slow on write. And that was exactly what I saw. If you use the card mainly for MP3 or carrying Palm/PPC data, go for it. If you need to frequently write to the card (such as doing Palm/PPC backups, or using in a digital camera), go get one made by SanDisk (faster) or Panasonic (fastest, but very expensive), or specially marked high speed SDs."
5,Fast enough for my SD300's VGA 30fps video mode,"One of my reason for getting a Canon SD300 digicam is its great video capability - it's capable of shooting 640x480 at 30 fps until the memory card is full. Prior to this card, I had 4 Sandisk 256MB SD cards, and 3 of which have problem in this video mode (blinking red ""!"" mark with skipping frames).I was concerned about this card's speed performance after reading some of the reviews, but now I'm glad to say that it works well on my SD300. It is able to handle 640x480x30fps with no dropped frames on my camera. I've shot up to 3 minutes, creating a 350MB+ AVI file, with no problem. And it's very inexpensive to boot. I didn't need the 32x cards which costs about 30% more.With that said, you should note that I have the new Canon SD300, which was released only a month ago and is a fast camera in general. Your mileage may vary based on the camera you have and its speed when streaming video from internal buffer to memory card."
2,be careful of this one,"A friend gave me this card for free, when I travled to Arizona. I use this card in my Dell X51V.From time to time, this card can't be recoginize by the PDA. I have to pull it out and re-insert it in, and reset my PDA.Then oneday, my GPS software showed ""Map data corrupted"". All the data in the card was wiped out, and the card's space reduced to around 300M, have no idea where the remaining space goes to.Don't put important data on this one!!! That's my lesson."
4,Good for what it is,"I won't repeat what so many other reviewers have aptly said: that it is a wonderful book with beautiful photos and good ideas.My comment, or criticism, is for readers who are serious cooks (i.e. they cook frequently for more than 2 or 3 people, and when they cook it is not just ""microwave"" or ""instant"" cooking). The book does not help much in dealing with design issues from the perspective a a serious cook. There are many ways modern kitchen design can be improved for serious cooks, but this books does not sufficiently address them. This book is great as far as it goes, but if you are serious about cooking you might want to tap some other sources as well."
2,"many picture ideas, short on substance","A book with a picture collection of ideas, but very dated if not outdated. Many kitchens appear based from the 1960s era. The book almost comes across as a gathering of many old pictures assembled to glean the final dollar profit in book publishing. Despite what the lead review suggests about ""Its sharp photography"" - photo reproduction is second rate. For those just starting the thought process and starting with minimal knowledge of kitchen building the book represents a possible starting point, but lacks true substance beyond that point. Those looking to build an upscale kitchen are well advised to look elsewhere; ""At Home With America's Top (26) Chefs"" is arguably the best of the best, a book with solid ideas and concepts applicable even to the more modest kitchen."
3,I wasn't that impressed.,"There are some great pictures in this book, but overall I wasn't that impressed, alot of the appliances look dated, as does some of the decor. Still it makes a nice reference book, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it."
3,Not what I expected,I purchased this because I thought it was Ideas FOR the Kitchen not Ideas FOR A Kitchen. I thought it would contain examples of ways to improve your Kitchen. Instead this is better suited if you are starting from scratch.
5,Great inspiration pictures,This book contains many photos of many different styles of kitchens. It is a great resource for ideas as well as choices of materials. It also does a good job defining the different jargon you may encounter while planning your kitchen. It's not a how to guide. I highly recommend this book.
3,"A couple of decent songs, but largely goes to show why this once-great group has had it by now","Between 1983 & 1988, The Deele was one of the 80s better groups for slick, groovy R&B. By the time this album came around in 1993, the group had lost three members (including Babyface), and their absence proves less than subtle here. Though not without any redeemable songs (""Are You Ready To Be Loved?"" and ""My Love For You Will Last Forever"" are quite good), the bulk of this album is a tired retread of a formula that had been much fresher back in the 80s. Die-hard Deele-o-philes shouldn't hate it, but there's really nothing here that touches you the way ""Sweet November,"" ""Eyes Of A Stranger,"" ""Shoot 'Em Up Movies"", or ""Two Occasions"" does."
1,skip this skate board,"very poor quality skate board. I payed $10 for it, and that was about how much it was worth. Wheels came off after a day of use from my son."
1,Junk,"The wheels and bearings on this skateboard are a piece of junk. The wheels would barely spin. The grip tape is basically painted on sandpaper, also total junk. It's really too bad as the deck itself is pretty decent. I would recommend spending a bit more money and buying theAndy Mac Zon Complete Skateboard (7.625 x 31.625)because for not much more money you get 100% quality components. I own both and there is a drastic difference in quality."
3,Chew tube,"Maybe I have a picky Guinea, but she rarely chews it. We used part of the yellow soft stuff under the igloo for there was so much she wouldn't go near the tube. Now she runs through it occassionally. The yellow stuff stains very easily. Pet stores have more of the soft stuff for about $2."
4,"awesome, but...","My hamster loves this tube...and my guinea pig also loves the big one. I would give it five stars because it is an awesome product...except for one thing...the fluff bedding. It is not safe for little critters like these, who can easily ingest it. Loses one star...only for the ""fluff"". Otherwise, an excellent toy!"
1,Buy a hay tube instead!,"I bought this thinking it would be good for my new bunny, but afterward I read the fine print, which states that the bedding material inside the tube should not be eaten! I removed the material and am going to use it just for the tube, but I saw the same sort of tubes filled with hay and I wish I had bought one of those instead."
3,Zora's Root-PBS Program tape,"This is a PBS documentary about Zora Neale Hurston. I found it a bit dry, factual but lacking references or footage about some of her very interesting work, collecting folk tales, dances & songs. The movie (Hollywood style) My Name is Zora, provides better visibility into that part of her life."
2,Not worth the money or the time,"I was disappointed. The documentary is superficial, slow paced, boring, and the facts it covers could have been handed out on a piece of paper--the visuals don't add much at all. No exciting clips from the movie version of Their Eyes were Watching God--just an outline of her biography. Uninspired to the max. Compared to other documentaries on African American authors, like _Ralph Ellison: An American Journey_ and _Richard Wright: Black Boy_, this one wasn't worth the time to watch."
4,Learning goes down easy!,Ethel Diamond wrote such a terrific book..informative and so humorous. A non-frightening way to approach Philosophy. I got so interested I started reading more books on Philosophy. Why not write another one on another subject Ethel. Then I can keep learning!
5,"Brass Lovers, Take Note!","I heard this piece on the radio station ""Conoisseur Classics"" and I thought ""What is That?"" It sounded like the kind of music you'd expect to hear in heaven when the Pope arrives! It's awesome - golden - gigantic - spacious - sonorous - moving. You've never heard anything like the sound of seventy-seven trombones playing together. (And I assure you, it's sounds nothing like Meredith Willson!)"
4,Great book to get you started,First I must confess to being a guy so maybe not the target audience. Haven said that I think this is a great book regardless of your gender. What I really liked about this book was that it took the fear out of investing. I am a qualified accountant yet investing still filled me with dread. This book broke down the whole mystery of investing into simple steps and gave me the confidence to just go ahead and start!
5,Buy Now. For Every Woman trying to Live Abundantly,I love this book so much. Glinda breaks down investing step by step. I love her encouragement and belief in the success of the reader to learn more about investing. I'm starting to follow her advice and reap the great rewards. I bought her first book after reading this treasure. Buy Now. Stop living Check to Check.
5,"You go, Ladies!!!","This is the first popular book on finance I've ever read that didn't make me want to go out and cut my throat because I'd been so stupid and now it was too late! Instead, the authors explain how to think in terms of abundance, not deprivation, and explain how it's NEVER too late.Another great thing about this book is that it integrates saving and investing into your life, not just your lifestyle, and shows how they can actually enhance your value system.Buy it. It's the WHAT COLOR IS YOUR PARACHUTE of investing."
4,"GIRL, YOU'D BETTER FIND A WAY TO HANG ON TO IT TOO!","A truly wonderful book. However there is a crucial element that must be addressed in light of what is coming down the pike at us ""Girls"". If you read Arnold's The Great Bust Ahead (or visit the book's website at thegreatbustahead.com) you will gain insights into what may be the greatest depression in history beginning just a few years from now. This will probably affect women the most, and women (and men) of color more than others. So, whatever us Girls can make by following Glinda's advice needs to be protected (i.e. not lost in the coming depression) by reading Arnold's advice."
2,Does this really work?,"I have not noticed any difference in my dog since I started giving him this product. I do understand that different calming products don't work for every pet, it's a matter of trial and error. This was an error for my dog and I'll be trying again with a different product this month."
3,It was ok,I must have a really good Pastor because I felt like I knew most of the stuff in the book. I think there were a few good points like it's good to have a connection with someone but seeing if they can COMMIT is just as important. I think this book would be good for someone just starting out in the Church. I do know someone that enjoyed the book so don't let my opinion discourage you from buying the book.
1,Useless and patronising,"I bought this book and still cannot think of a worse way to have wasted my money. The book is full of outdated ideas served with a patronizing sauce on a pseudoscience glazed platter. Come on ! I'd like to think that us women are intelligent beings, why is the author treating us otherwise?"
5,AVP Alien Vs. Preastor,"The book was diffrent from the movie.Like how when the movie only had three predtors in it and the book had five, or like how they keep switching from when the predators came to earth every 100 years or every 1,000 years. I was disapointed I thought the booke would have more gory sceans in it but when they did they were very discripitive. I thought the book was overall amazing."
1,AVP NOVEL,"i WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTINED IN THIE BOOK, AND IF THE MOVIE IS ANYTHING LIKE THE BOOK THEN THERE WILL BE SOME PISSED OF FANS. NOTHING LIKE ANY OF THE PREVIOUS MOVIES, PREDATORS DON'T ACT LIKE PREDAOTRS AND ALIENS DON'T ACT LIKE ALIENS. WAY TO MUCH HUMAN REALTION GOING ON IN THIS BOOK. TOO BAD COULD'VE BEEN EPIC. BYE-BEY ALIEN AND PREDATOR NICE TO HAVE KNOWN YOU"
3,Not too bad,"First off, I'm a huge fan of the Alien vs. Predator comics, novels, and video games...it should come as no surprise that the novelization for the upcoming film is pretty much the same. I felt that the characters were typical for this type of adventure and I didn't really care about them. The only thing that really kept my interest were the battles between the predators and the aliens, which should look pretty good on screen. Some fans of AVP will enjoy the book, others will read a little and toss it aside to pursue something else."
1,"starts out great, but disappoints in the end","I am a huge fan of the independent aliens and predator movies. Also, I was looking forward to the movie coming out in August. However, just to make sure I wouldn't be wasting 8 dollars on the movie, I decided to read the book, first. That way, if I didn't like the book, then I could at least get my money back.I sure was happy I made this decision because, if the book is any indication, the movie will be horrible. The screenplay has huge promise, but the script eventually unravels into some lamedrama. Everything in the plot is drivative. You'd be better offrenting predator or the original Alien movie."
1,Absolutely useless,I am always a little leery when using 3rd party chargers. but this name has been around for a while. Their Auto Charger works great.However my Axim has not been the same since I tried to use the wall charger. I attempted to charge my device while on a trip. The screen went completely blank and would not turn back on. Only after re-seating the battery will it come back. But now I have backup battery errors.....the problem is that this device DOES NOT HAVE A BACKUP BATTERY according to Dell. Stay away.
5,Remember the Alamo House,"This is a hilarious but touching novel that hit me perfectly as I went through a divorce and had me laughing all the way through it (the book not the divorce). Even though I'm a man, the book was on the nose and it's description of working for a terrible non-profit left wing newspaper was perfect."
2,Modern Marvels Needs a Bit More Research,"There are a number of factual errors in the presentation, and a substantial amount of political posing. Having been born on the Canal Zone and actively studied the subject over the years this is not the video to spend your money on......."
2,Modern Marvels left us wanting more.,"While the video was good as far as it went... It didn't go into nearly enough detail or expound on the true difficulty of building the canal.If you want a better understanding of what really went on try the ""A man, A plan, A canal:Panama"" instead..."
2,Hp 44 Cyan Cartridge expired shelf life,"Only giving two stars because the Hp 44 Cyan Cartridge (51644C) was described as NEW. It's true that it is in the unopened original box but the manufacture date on the box is Feb 2005, this would have made the shelf life expired in Feb 2008. The cartridge sold is 4 years past the shelf life. Hopefully it will work, haven't tried it yet. Sellers should Include Date of Manufacture for Ink Cartridges, they do have a Shelf Life."
3,Item not in retail packaging,"The item arrived in due time, later than others ordered at the same time. The primary issue is that it was not in retail packaging, as shown in the picture, and nothing in the item description told me that. I have not used the cartridge as of yet, so cannot rate print quality."
4,Albert Campion saves the day!,"Margery Allingham's TRAITOR'S PURSE is a great mystery. Francis Matthews does the reading, and he is very good at maintaining the different English voices needed for the array of characters in this story. A good reader is vital to the enjoyment of an audiobook.Albert Campion wakes up in a hospital, not remembering who he is, nor does his memory come back for most of the story. He's constantly on the run, which keeps it exciting, but he doesn't know exactly what he's running from. Campion doesn't want to reveal his ignorance of the facts, so he plays along with the people who know him, gathering bits of background information. Lucky for him, he remembers all in the end, and saves Great Britain from a terrible conspiracy to bring it down. I highly recommend this audiobook!"
2,Average Stuff,"I heard a lot about this writer and this was the only book from her Campion series that was bit cheap. It is about a man who loses his memory and remembers it in spurts and saves his country! I am afraid I didn't enjoy it at all but I wouldn't say that I won't be reading this series in future. It is just not menacing enough though the writer tried to create such an atmosphere, some of the scenes read were very childish and Enid Blyton-ish, even Agatha's very bad books are better than this book!"
3,adequate but not excellent,"The music is grand, elaborate and highly original. However this performance with Alberto Martini conducting is mediocre and does not do it justice. Buy the recording with Reinhard Goebel and Musica Antiqua Cologne if you can get it."
3,"fine music, awful recording","I agree with half of what David Kemp says, I think it is fine music, but the performance and the sound are awful! I did not buy vol 2, so I can't comment on it. To hear a good version listen to that of Musica Antiqua Koln, if you can't hear the difference then there is no hope for you!Sorry to tread on people's feelings, and I don't want to knock Naxos, the sound quality in their recordings is usualy good."
4,"Clear, clean text. Elegant. Hip, but not hippie! A find.","Intellectually and aesthetically appealing. Tight, sparse Zen-like writing style. I""ve read them all. Bought them all. This is as refreshing as a drink from the ladle pictured on the cover."
5,Absolutely lovely book,I am the mother of a child with Down Syndrome and I look for books that put a graceful spin on disabilities to read to all my kids. This was a great book with great characters and the illustrations were adorable. My 8 year old loved it and reads it to her 9 month old brother who has DS. I will even admit to really liking it myself!! Thanks for a wonderful adventure Mr. Smith.
1,A Useless Instrument,"This instrument should be described as a ""cumbus mandolin"". It has mandolin neck attached to a cumbus pot. The instrument I purchased could not be tuned. Unwilling to give up on it, I had the best luthier in my area carve a compensated mandolin bridge for it, dress the frets (which were rough and not level), and adjust the neck. This work cost more than the instrument itself. The result: a wallhanger, except that the thing isn't attractive enough to be an ornament. One could, I suppose, remove the strings and the plastic head and use it as a saucepan.If you're in the market for a banjo-mandolin (or banjolin), buy a real one. Don't waste a moment or a dime on this."
2,Not right,"Not the thing I was trying to buy. Not a standard track lighting connector. I was looking for the most basic standard cheapo track lighting, this is some other style."
4,C'est chic et bien fou-fou!,"Great ambient party music for any gathering of hipsters, nonchalants, chic geeks, supermodels, gigolos, mobsters and aspiring Parisian Beatniks...Only those with a yearning for danceable after hours house-of-style mixing will warm up to this CD...I'm one of 'em, and this CD makes me hot. Il fait chaud, baby!!Buy it if you ""get it""..."
2,"Repetición, repetición, repetición","Tremendamente decepcionante. Hay tres temas buenos: 2, 5 y 8. El resto de los cortes repiten hasta la saciedad el equívoco de la música ""ambient"" o ""chill-out"" de hoy en día: una y otra vez oímos un compás más o menos pegadizo (más menos que más) hasta el aburrimiento durante 6 minutos. Temas absolutamente ramplones con las excepciones indicadas. Una buen alternativa, si te gusta Sirley Bassey, es comprar ""Diamonds are forever"". Sólidas versiones, sin duda."
2,Boring & uninspired,A great disappointment- I have the 1st two Costes which are OK - like a more Spanish Cafe del Mar. But this compilation does not inspire- it is a bit like audio wallpaper..... elevator music. If you want more cutting edge and thought try Claude Challe or Ravin stuff.
4,Very good lounge music,"A great mix of songs/music to fill space with pleasurable sounds that never conflict with each other, yet are different from one another.Plus, as an ""exiled"" Parisian, the title is enough to evoque the wonderful Hotel Costes which is a must-see located in the heart of Paris. There, in beautiful surroundings you get to hear this music and it sounds even better!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"A Collision of Soul, Jazz, Dance and culture beats.","I highly recommend Vol. 1 and Vol.3. The beats, harmonies and lyrics are upbeat one minute, soothing and mellow the next. It's a collision of Soul, Jazz, Dance and culture beats. Perfect for a Sunday drive or the office. Any music lover will not be disappointed of this collection."
4,interesting collection,"Mario lanzas version of the act1 final from madama butterfly show,s he could have took over the opera world with no problem which is what he should have done in the first place.And i like to point out that the last 3 song,s from this cd are obviously better than the 3 versions from the rca soundtrack of mario lanza sings songs from the student prince and the desert song. this allso shows if hollywood would have just let him star in better pictures than the ones he was in things could have been grander.All the movies were bad but the songs were excellent and they show lanza could have did well in films like carousel,south pacific and kismet"
3,"John, John, Let's Hope for the Truth (gimme gimme)","Skimpy, but seems to be substantially true given the largely corroborating accounts of Goldman and Guilano."
3,I'm just a jealous guy,"Well, It seems to me that Rosen is a guy who is very jealous of Lennon's geniuses and life.There isn't a single page in the book that doesn't say bad things about John.Sometimes in the middle of a phrase, camouflaged, but the bad thing is there.And first of all, the book is based (even relying on Rosen's memory) on stolen material that another weird guy (that I won't name here) took from Lennon's house.This is not right.But I'm giving three stars just because this can always be red with all this things in mind.So there is a good amount of stories about Lennon's last years.Just don't trust the book so much.Read it as Rosen's interpretation of things, not the absolute truth."
5,Amply Named,"This is one of those books after reading just a few pages hooks you. I wouldn't take the risk of reading it in the bathtub. Rosen skillfully and effectively takes you into the conflicted mind of Lennon via his diary. You know your there, right in the midst of his inner thoughts and motivations as he does battle between his higher and lower self. I was a bit surprised at how often his lower self prevailed.That's just what makes this book so special, the difference between Lennon the genius and spokesman for peace and the private Lennon who, just like everybody else, was miguided and had his share of small thoughts.This was a well researched, well written effort and definitely the most revealing and interesting of any Beatle book out there."
5,MUST LENNON READ,"This book is a must read for any John Lennon fan. This really gives a great discription of his seclusion days in the Dakota. It really showed him how commited he was to Sean and Yoko. I still believe he was a psycho, but I have a better understanding after reading this book."
3,Good read,"I would have rated this book 5 stars, but due to Lennon's diaries haunting him, you can't be 100% sure if this all true. A lot of things have been true like Yoko drinking Vodka during one of the Double Fantasy sessions. But things like what he thought of Julian calling him for money and what happened during his trip to South Africa. I would only recommend this to big Lennon fans."
2,Nowhere Man? Nowhere Book!!,I was disapointed with this lackluster attempt of a book!! The Last Days of John Lennon was much better at giving readers a glimpse of Lennon's final years. It seemed that Rosen was regurgitating what he remembered from some old diaries.Which wasn't much.
5,Another Reader's Comments,"This is a fabulous book--a real page-turner. The intimate details about Lennon's day to day life in those last years are really something special. The book is very funny throughout, and of course, finally very sad. I enjoyed the way the author chose to end the book. And I liked the interweaving of the astrological forecasts, numerology information throughout, and all the contradictions of spirituality and materialism. The entire book seemed to be written with a delicate touch, even though we were seeing into more than one person's inner world."
2,Neocon Warmonger,"Jasper Becker belongs in the camp that wants to attack North Korea and force regime change. As such, this book tries to justify a war by hyping up all the bad things happening in North Korea. He is also trying to sell his book by sensationalizing North Korea like a cheap tabloid. He thinks that America can save the North Koreans by destroying their country. This book is almost a neocon propaganda - very biased, and one-sided."
2,"Poorly organized, hard to follow","Becker provides a relatively detailed exposition on the history of Korea and how the reign of Kim Jong Il came to be. Unfortunately, the book lacks a coherent organization and is, at times, difficult to follow. It's almost as if he had a set of anecdotes he wanted to include in the book and hastily organized them into chapters. One page he's talking about Italian chefs being flown in with pizza ovens to teach Italian cooking, then suddenly there is discussion of Stalin and Mao.It's unfortunate because there is good information in this book (I think) and it's an interesting read, but it could really benefit from being written chronologically and just having a better organization overall.Personally I wouldn't recommend it."
4,An excellent examination of the politics and life in The Hermit Nation,"Jasper Becker does an excellent job detailing the rise to power of Kim il Sung and his struggles with the totally psychotic Kim Jong Il.The book is well written and explores the horrific conditions North Koreans endure as well as the Machiavellian manner that Jong Il treats those close to him.Becker derives most of his information from interviews with North Koreans who have escaped, but also uses military intel and his own travels there to craft a startling picture.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in NK (I'd also be remiss if I didn't ferverently recommend ""Aquariums of Pyongyang, one of the finest books ever written on this subject.)One caveat comes to mind however: The opening chapter examining what might occur in case of a military strike against NK is just down right hokey, and I'd implore the reader to carry on as it gets much better."
5,Best book I've read on North Korea,"If you want to read just one book on North Korea, make it this one. Becker draws on many sources to document a broad range of crimes and mismanagement by the North Korean government. He argues persuasively that human rights abuses are Kim Jong Il's biggest problem, not his nuclear weapons. Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations to control his military ambitions, he needs to be held accountable for crimes against his own people.The book is sobering, eye opening, and a must-read for anyone interested in North Korea."
5,Great Birthday Gift,I bought this stuffed animal for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loves it. It's just as big as a normal stuffed bear and can easily fit in a medium sized gift bag or basket.
5,Adorable,My young adult daughter wants a German Shepard and this was the perfect gift! It is made well and the coloring is excellent.
4,Sprightly and Spirited !!,"Locatelli has great fluxuation in composition regarding sound, emotion, and feelings. I get a smile on my face due to the positive mood Locatelli's music creates. Fantastic sound and reverb on this cd. Excellent Music !!This cd is energetic and scintillating! What a great investment if you have all the other basic composers. Locatelli truly is like a breath of fresh air !Lesser known composers similar to Locatelli include: Manfredini, Albinoni, Geminiani, Corelli, Boccherini, Caldara, Buxtehude, Telemann, Purcell, and Tartini. Any of these are great values on the Naxos label, with awesome sound and quality. All around $5.00 if you shop around on the internet!Have a great day friends !"
5,52-week baseball training,Got this book for my HS team and it's great. The books gives me day-by-day workouts for all of my players on a year-around basis.
3,Its ok....,"This is a OK comp of older Goth bands, ... but its a good comp to own if your curious about some of the older bands.As a DJ I find the following tracks useful:Bauhaus - Dark EntriesSouthern Death Cult - Moya (you might know them as the Cult)Gene Loves Jezebel - Shaving My NeckTones On Tail - Burning SkiesSex Gang Children - Dieche (one of the better songs on here)Christian Death - This Is Heresy...."
1,freezefest,"tried to play a dvd backup, it froze after 30 minutes. the same dvd plays fine on my apex player. component video looks bad, even though i have a toshiba tv. stay away from this one, even at that price."
2,VCR is OK but DVD is problematic,"I bought this unit a year ago, so I have used it extensively. The first one I received had to be sent right back because the DVD tray wouldnt open. The replacement arrived and it worked fine for most of the full year. However, over the last few weeks, the DVD had developed the skip, and skip-freeze problem that others have mentioned. It always had a little problem where the jump feature or skip ahead feature was used too many times the disk would start to click loudly in the player and the playback would freeze. Simply ejecting the DVD and re-inserting it would fix it, however, now it only provides a few minutes of good playback before it starts to freeze, stutter and click.It's just not a very good DVD player in terms of quality, but it was priced cheap. Only buy this unit if you plan on replacing it in a year or are more concerned with the VCR playback, otherwise get a dedicated DVD player and dedicated VCR."
1,Huge piece of junk.,"I bought this on Amazon 6 months ago and wish I didn't. I didn't listen to the bad reviews. Now this DVD player is freezing up on the picture anywhere from every few seconds to every couple minutes. Sometimes you have to FF or stop it to get it to play again. Plus if you set the timer on the vcr then it automatically goes to the DVD screen and you can't watch any t.v. This is really bad for people who use timers a lot which I do because I have them set for every week so the timer is constantly on. Plus the unit is kind of loud which other reviewers wrote about. Now the DVD player is unwatchable because who wants the picture constantly freezing up (this was for both DVD rental movies, dvd's I own, and dvd recordings of home videos."
1,DVD player is terrible,"The DVD player won't play many DVD's, even freshly unwrapped new ones. Freezes and stutters. Simply the worst piece of electronic gear I've ever owned."
1,Pulled my hair out,"Even when new, the DVD player would freeze and stutter step on some prerecorded DVDs. It was my first DVD player, so I wrote it off as scratched/marred discs (we rent most of ours). Then as the warranty expired, it would spaz on virtually every disc. The kids would be hysterical as Dash froze in his unIncredible escape. When ejected, the disc was a hot pancake! I then bought another CHEAP DVD player which has worked great on all DVDs for a year.MORAL OF THE TALE. Steer clear of this model - YUCK"
2,"Okay, but not the best","This is my first DVD player. I bought it so that I could watch some old TV favorites on DVD. The only problem I have encountered so far is with the DVD portion of the machine. There are shadows on the screen whenever I watch a DVD. By that I mean that whatever channel my TV is on shows through on the DVD picture. You can actually see the outline (or shadows) on the DVD picture. It is like watching two shows at one time. I am not too upset because I did not pay a lot, but if I had it to over again, I would have bought a different brand."
1,Beware,I would strongly advise people not to buy this product. They are poorly made and the customer service is lousy. I'll be buying a different brand of electronics from now on.
1,Amazon shipping is the killer,"WHATEVER you do, if buying this or any other item from AMAZON, triple check your shipping information. If you've ordered before, they assume you want it shipped to the same address as the last time. And, once you've submitted the order, it WON'T be CHANGED... regardless of where it is being shipped. If the item was in-stock, AMAZON considers it shipped the moment you hit the ""submit"" button and will NOT change or cancel the order from that moment on."
4,Excellent customer service from Toshiba,"I had the V 391 model for a year. That model developed skipping and freezing when the DVD was playing. I called Toshiba customer service. They replaced the 391 with a 392 model. So far, the 392 is working perfectly."
1,poor performer,"After reading a LOT of reviews, this combo sounded too good to be true. It was. Set up was EZ and instructions were simple. The remote was OK however the red lettering on tan made hard to read. Problem is the VCR recordings are awful. Used new tapes, still awful. The DVD also is not the best. Occational freeze and skips. Not happy, returning it today."
1,Not worth it,"I've had this unit for several months now. It's always been picky aobut the DVDs it will play. Some skip badly, some won't play at all. Yet these same disks play just fine in other players.This unit takes forever to power up and come on. The disk drive eject time can be measured with sundial (very slow).Tonight the whole unit just quite working. It freezes and then powers off. Of course, it's out of warrentee now....Don't buy."
3,"Great for the price, but nothing more","Pros:- Really great image for the price- Works great with the ''original'' stuffCons:- Didn't have any problem until I tried some DVD-R and recorded cassettes. On the VCR, there were some white lines on the TV. When I tried DVD-R product, the image froze, paused, etc.Bottom line: I couldn't watch DVD-R with this, even if the DVD is supposed to be able to read them. I read some reviews on the Internet and there seems to be a lot of ''compatibility'' problems with the DVD-R and DVD in general. So be careful."
1,Just barely accptable,"I have waited several months to give using this unit a fair chance to prove itself, but there are just too many features that are not user-friendly to warrant anybody else getting stuck with this piece of junk. A few of my gripes:1. There is nothing intuitive about setting the timed recording features. One almost has to learn and remember a programming language to be sure to get it right given the bewildering array of all-too-small buttons.2. As some one else said too -- it won't record in LP; just standard and super long-play.3. It freezes up all too frequently in DVD. Not fatally, but annoyingly. Taping often have major ""static"" bursts recorded.4. For some reason it turns on DVD when it shuts off after recoding a TV program in VHS. If you try to record two sequential programs on different TV channels it won't do it while you're watching the TV.All-in-all, not something worth buying. Hardly worth bothering with as a gift."
1,Terrible,"There is a class action suit for customers to get their money back. My previous Toshiba VCR had lasted 15 years, so I exkpect good results. I bought mine about a year ago. The controls are very complicated. About a month after I bought it the Video would only come out part way. The I would then have to push the eject again and pull the video out. Now it has completely stopped and I am looking for a new one."
3,"So far, so good.","I ordered and received the product approximately 1-2 months ago. I have not had any problems with the VCR or DVD player. As I titled, so far, so good. I would recommend the purchasing of this."
1,BEWARE!!!,Beware of poor product description on this Toshiba DVD/VCR player. While it has Component and S-Video quality outputs.....they only work with the DVD Player! The VCR only has Composite outputs for it!!!! Who uses Composite outputs in this day! I requested a refund 10 minutes after I opened the box....which was so worn and torn that it was obvious others had done exactly the same thing!
2,Okay for Short Term Use,"My husband won this VCR/DVD player at a trade show, so we got it for free. It worked fine for about 1 1/2 years with very light use (maybe playing one DVD every month to two months).Last night I watched a movie on it and it worked fine. This morning, it is completely dead for no reason. Basically it appears power is just not getting to the machine. I have read several other reviews to this effect on this product and other Toshiba products, so I don't think this is a freak occurrence.Basically, I think this is a fine product if you get it cheap and recognize that it is not a quality piece of equipment that will serve you for an extended length of time. I find it slightly extra annoying that there was no warning whatsoever that it was on its way out, but it is what it is."
2,Doesn't last long,"I bought this unit in September of 2004 and was very satisfied with it. Then, for no reason, it just died in January 2007. Seemed like a connection was loose and that electricity wasn't getting to it, but everything was hooked up tight. I had to use a butter knife to pry open the DVD player to get the DVD out that was in it. I think it should have lasted more than just a bit over 3 years with little to moderate use. I replaced it with a JVC that got great consumer reviews."
1,"CHEAP, and you sure get what you pay for!","I've had mine all of 4 months. Oopps, that's not true, I had to send the first one back in Dec., DVD skipped. Two weeks LATER, another one arrives. Note, under the generous 90 day warranty, you have to ship them your unit, then they ship back another.Now, the VCR doesn't work, after playing probably 5 tapes in 4 months. I guess it just couldn't stand the heavy use.If you buy this dog, keep all the packaging and buy a back up, hopefully not a Toshiba!!!!!!!"
4,"Toshiba SD-V392 DVD/VCR Combo,Silver","The first new Toshiba SD-V392 i received a few years ago performed well for awhile then the DVD player wouldnt play and the door jammed.Then the timer recording wouldnt work.Finally,the video tape head on the VCR went out,only the audio could be heard during playback of recording programs.After i received my second Toshiba SD-V392 through amazon.com,so far this used product is working great,even though i havent used all the features on it."
2,Went bad before 90 day warranty was up,Do not like the pause. After 5 minutes it starts playing again. Would rather it shut off or something other than playing. I have to rewind and find my spot again. After 2 months the tracking went South. Cannot track with ATS or manual. Am sending it in for service today.
2,Save Your Money!,"I bought this combo unit for an office in Dec 2004. It literally has been used a handful of times. At exactly the one year mark, the dvd player started freezing up during movies, very annoying to have to restart a movie constantly. Now it sends only sound from the dvd player, no picture at all! I hesitated buying a combination unit, but I figured since it was going in an office for minimal use I was pretty safe. Save your money and go for separate components."
2,Poor Customer Service,Even the number they provide for technical assistance is inoperative. Then they have the gall to be unresponsive.
2,Re-call it,Have other Toshiba products and have been very satisfied. this ones no good. Serious tracking problem on VCR playback made it impossible to watch since I purchased it. Received notice of the defect from the factory sometime ago but they never did anything about it. Will probably trash it and look for a different brand.
1,VCR menu does not work.,I ordered this item and the VCR menu does not work. It scrolls constantly on the screen or does not come up at all. This is obviously a defect as I sent it back for a replacement and had the same problem again. Do not buy this item.
2,Had it for 2 weeks - will return it.,"I had this unit for 2 weeks and it worked ok but the vcr and dvd menus are just horrible. The instructions are terrible too and the VCR stops in the middle of programmed recordings. I have had it, I am taking it back."
1,Waste of money,This product was not exactly as it was illustrated. I had to throw it out after a month.
1,Stay Away......,"Well this is my first time writing a review and it's because this is the worst tool I have ever purchased here (Amazon). The angle clamping mechanism makes the clamp itself move left or right when tightly clamped down. I purchased the 24"" and 48"" and want to return them but can't seem to find the manufacture of this product. I wanted to try re-selling them here but I don't have the heart to upset a potential buyer."
2,not what was advertised,i ordered a 3.0 amp hour battery and received a 2.8 amp hour battery.i actually needed a 3.5 amp .battery. are you going to tell me that they are all the same?the receipt in the box said 3 amp battery what gives?
3,Expert insights into the peloton marred by poor editing.,"Samuel Abt writes with great insight about the twilight of Greg LeMond's career and the early successes of Lance Armstrong's. His access to first-hand sources and knowledge of the sport is excellent.Unfortunately, awful editing, including repeated sentences and paragraphs, detract significantly from the reading of a book that is short enough to have been easily cleaned up. These errors make the book difficult to read without wondering if the pages were printed in the proper order."
5,Incredible Music and an awesome message!!!!,"Oh man! You guys have't lived until you hear this album! They totally blow my mind! The musicianship is among the best I have heard in Christian music. No, It's among the best anywhere! If you ever get the chance to see them live, GO!!!!!!!! You'll be drooling by the end of their first set!!"
2,"I have to say I didnt really care for it, # 2 was o.k.","I liked the # 2 song, the rest was to me not what I would listen to in a gospel song. Too dippy! sorry"
4,Often sadly overlooked,"Burlap to Cashmere is a very talented and original band as far as musicality is concerned. They have very impressive guitar solos (almost a classical Spanish style) in many of their songs, and their fine natural abilities in rhythm allow them to create *solid* music in difficult time signatures (namely 5/4).""Treasures in Heaven"", and occasionally ""Basic Instructions"", are commonly played on the radio stations. Add the title song, ""Is There Anybody Out There"", and you already have three songs that are so good that you already feel like you got your money's worth.I refrained from giving it a fifth star only because their lyrics are not necessarily theologically deep or worship-inspiring... but this is my personal opinion. Definitely exciting and great for listening!One last helpful hint: don't forget that you can look to find out what music other people have bought. If you like the other music, you'll probably like this music."
5,This Group is a Force!,I just read most of the reviews posted here and I couldn't be in more agreement. It seems the general feeling is Burlap to Cashmere is having a significant impact on anyone who listens. I've listened to Christian music now for 15 years and I can honestly say the future of this genre is B to C. No longer are artists afraid to combine their talents with their faith. I predict this group will make their way into popular music and soon. I look forward to their next release. To all listeners who don't know Jesus now you may have some insight why a belief in Him is worth singing about and why a talented group like B to C would have it no other way. Thanks be to God and Burlap to Cashmere for your witness and courage. I think I'll play this CD right now!
4,"Good cd, but not without flaws","I enjoy Burlap to Cashmere's cd, but I think the cd could be better. The songs on the cd that I like, I like a lot. The songs have awesome harmony, and their style is very unique. But there are several songs that are at best mediocre. I think the main problem with the other songs are that they either don't clearly portray a Christian message, or they are just boring. Still, the cd is well worth its price, and it is great to listen to."
5,"""Burlap To Cahmere"" The Best Band Of The Year",I thought that there album was very spiritual and very catchy. They have a great beat and they seem to be very in sync with eachother. I would love to see Dave Mathews and them get together and make an album. That would bring in a few bucks i think. I also think that they will be a great success and will continue to make great music::BEST SONG ON ANYBODY OUT THERE: MANSIONS
4,Bold & Creative,"This is a wonderful record. BtC has incorporated some elements not typically heard in modern day pop/rock records. These guys throw in wondeful Mediterranean flourishes on nylon string guitar. The songs basically fall into two types. 1) the driving rhythmic anthems, and 2) the unadulterated pop tune. Fortunately they do both quite well. I would've given the record 4 1/2, but that wasn't possible, so I gave it a 4 because it is solid, but not perfect (what is?) Plus that gives the band room to grow. I discovered these guys by a fluke, they were opening up for one of my friend's bands during a swing through the south. Hanging out with the guys backstage, I can say that they are true gentlemen and seem to be wonderful people on top of making good records. I also appreciate the open boldness of their Christian message. A rare (but welcome) thing indeed these days! Thankfully there is no fence sitting on this record. do yourself a favor people, pick up this disc.......you won't be sorry."
4,Great albumn,"I first heard Burlap to Cashmere at Big Spring Jam (Huntsville Alabama) back in Sept. '99. I was struck by the instrumental ... well, what's the word? - brilliance, would have to be it. I bought the albumn - kept it in the CD changer in the car for - oh, 'bout 2 years. I recommend it highly. Today, I was playing it at home for my 16 month old daughter and she was dancing. She liked Ms. Morgan's ""rap"" too. :) When are these guys going to do another?"
5,Great CD,"I first became familiar with Burlap to Cashmere after hearing their hit song ""Basic Instructions"" on the radio. Then I found the title track on mp3 and I was amazed at how good it was. The lyrics are beautiful, the guitar work is excellent, and the music is great! The style of this album ranges from mellow to wild and jazzy. Each song has it's own unique style. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes upbeat music with a good clean message. I can't wait for the next Burlap to Cashmere CD!"
5,This album rocks!,Burlap to Cashmere is a talented group that can get you moving to the beat while singing lyrics that make you think about God. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes a strong beat and uplifting music.
3,Good First Person Shooter,"I love this game on 360, so I had to get it for my PSP. It's fun with long missions and a good story line. The only thing is the graphics and controls. I've seen some amazing graphics put out by the PSP, this game is average. And, as everyone with a PSP knows, First person shooters are really difficult to play on PSP. The controls just don't work quite right. Still, good FPS, worth buying."
4,Great Sound For Your PSP,Logic 3 has created a great and versatile sound system.I love its design. It can hold my PSP at a perfect angle to watch movies or I can attach a 3.5mm in line extension cable and hold my PSP while I play video games.Incredible sound is generated from an internal 3D surround sound processor. It can be powered from an AC adapter which is included or four AA batteries.If the AC adapter is used and the PSP is in the docking cradle it will recharge your PSP while you watch your movies.I can only think of two negatives.1) The steep price and no remote control.2) At loud volumes 3D processor generates some distortion.
3,"Awesome sound, but be careful!!!!!!","The sound on this is amazing! I could never hear movies on the psp that well. Now, perfect. It also charges the psp, used to use it everyday. One time though when taking the psp out of the system, it bent the earphone jack inside the psp. No sound out of the psp after that. To plug the psp into it, you need to put it in the earphone jack and the power jack. Sort of a snug fit. Just be careful using it."
4,PSP Logic 3 Sound System,"I am very happy with the PSP Logic 3 Sound System.Nice sound, better than i expected."
5,Worth it,"Amazing sound,It's a little bulky,but man the sound is awesome.I was playing MLB 06 and my brother in law thought it was live play by play from a TV broadcast."
1,Phooey!,"I bought this CD for the, supposedly, 12"" version of their one and only classic--""Rock the Boat,"" but for a little over three-minute version of the song, it is most definitely not worth buying at all. I suppose they still didn't have extended play versions at the time, but to advertise something as a 12"" version should mean that it should be different from the am/radio short version, and this is way too short to warrant being called a 12' version. Forget this album, you might as well find the song in any of the various artists dance compilations in the same short, short format. Boo!!!!"
2,Dissappointing,"I bought this cd, because there is no other with all their hits. I especially bought for the 12"" versions. But to my surprise only ""love corporation"" is about 10 seconds longer than the original on vinyl. The rest isn't."
3,Some good tracks are missing,"It's amazing how some artists seem to have more compilations on CD than original albums on vinyl. I'm a big fan of the Hues Corporation, but I really don't know what to make of this CD. The only reason for buying it is that it is the only one to include ""Live a Lie"" from the group's debut album. But then, it leaves out ""Go To The Poet"" and ""Off My Cloud"". The selection as a whole is good, but if you want just one, definitive compilation, choose ""The Very Best of The Hues Corporation"", instead. Even the Golden Classics collection, which has fewer tracks, can be a better choice."
4,12 inch version does not mean long play,"As for the fellow who said that he expected more for the so-called 12 inch version, apparently he is not very familiar with the album at all. What this simply means is that that song on this CD was taken from the original 12 inch album which I do have and is the same as this CD compilation"
3,Priceless,"The group that named themselves after a famous billionaire, one Mr. Howard Hughes...and scrambled the name a bit. The nuggets on this album of course are their biggest hits including ""Freedom For The Stallion"" ( also covered by Three Dog Night) and ""Rock the Boat"". There are quite a few above average tunes in this collection such as ""Love Corporation"" and ""Rockin' Soul"". Worth a listen."
4,"Rock the Boat ""12in"" Remix","This is a great cd for Hues Corporation fans (love the picture of them on the album cover alone! Remember seeing it as a kid in the record stores.) but buyers' beware. The track listings say that ""Rock the Boat"" and ""Rockin' Soul"" are 12in mixes . . . THAT'S NOT TRUE! Both singles are the original single releases. They both are around 3:00 min. long. Other than that, this is a good cd of their music."
5,"Grieg: Piano Music, Vol. 9","Grieg: Piano Music, Vol. 9 is a 1993 Naxos recording featuring the great pianist Einar Steen-Nokleberg. I have so far listened to three recordings of Grieg's piano music with this pianist and I can definitely say that the quality stays constant, i.e., on a superb level. The music notes by Ovind Nordheim are very well-written and interesting. A recording for fans of Grieg and it is certainly a fantastic bargain. Highly recommended. 5/5."
3,cheap looking,"This is a nice size but it looks very cheap. Functionally it would be good as it's big and has several compartments, but if you want it to look good, get something else. I returned this the same day it came in."
2,"After the dividers and padded compartments, not much room for files","I purchased this bag because other reviews said it was very large and had plenty of room for files but I was disappointed. It has a big padded area for a laptop, and additional dividers so despite the fact that it is a big bag the internal space isn't very versatile if you have larger files. So the search continues..."
2,"Doesn't fit 17"" macbook pro as advertised!","So I bought this for my gigantic 17"" macbook pro that I got for work, but it doesn't fit in the bag. It's nicely made, but big, and still doesn't fit this behemoth of a computer!"
2,Eat to live,"Though I can see how fasting may be beneficial I can't but pick up racial undertones which takes away from the purpose of this book. Even some of the foods that should be omitted I respect that because of the religious practices however it lacks ""ONE LOVE"" mentality to me...!"
5,Delightful Americana,"This CD presents sterling performances of 19th-century American piano composers such as Stephen Foster, Gottschalk, William Mason, MacDowell, and other lesser-known composers. They are presented with intelligence, taste, and are impeccably played. While there were no composers of the stature of Chopin or Schumann, American nonetheless had some talented musician/pianists and this disc is an important document of that era. High recommended."
4,Left little to be desired...but still left something to be desired,"Pros--came with everything you need to power, protect and transfer files from your PSP.-Soft outer case and carry handle make it comfortable to hold-you would spend more buying all of these items seperate-retractable cords are nice; no more tanglesCons--USB cords a little on the short side unless you are using them with a laptop literally in your lap-headphones seem a little cheap...buds are large and ended up hurting my ears after long period of use, and cord seems heavy with recoil contraption hanging off of it."
3,songs not by original artists,"a good collection of Bond film themes, but be advised that the lyrics are NOT by the original artists."
5,Scotland the Brave,"Are you kidding me? You ask what's the connection between Scotland and the Last of the Mohicans? Brush up on your history and you might figure it out. BTW, a great album."
2,Step backwards from previous model,"I've owned a Toshiba SD-3205 for about four years and absolutely love it. However, it wouldn't play DVD-Rs so I decided to upgrade to this model. I was shocked to find that this newer model was severely lacking in comparison: You can't change discs while you're watching, the simple and great joystick-type remote was gone, the player was buggy and slower to respond, the optical audio output was gone, and you can't select a disc by number. I returned it, had the firmware upgraded on my old (but high-quality) SD-3205, and enjoy watching DVDs (and DVD-Rs) again. Sad to say it, but Toshiba really dropped the ball on this product line, especially since it started out so right."
1,Cheap price buys cheap performance,"I got this to stop getting up all the time to change disks in my single DVD player. Now I'm getting up lots more trying to get this to work. Other reviews say it's slow to respond - they aren't kidding. Push ""open"" to access the tray and it grinds away for ten seconds deciding what to do. More often than not it'll stay closed and go back to the movie. Sometimes (not often) it freezes completely and has to restarted. Being cheap, it doesn't remember where it was and you have to scan through the movie to find your place. Also ultra susceptible to scratches/fingerprints so the picture stops and jumps frequently. Avoid like the plague."
1,Very dissappointing,"I purchased this 5 Disc DVD player to eliminate two of my console pieces from my audio/video rack. I was hoping that this item would replace my current DVD player & my 5 disc CD player as well.After about a month or so, I realized you are definitely getting what you pay for. When I purchased this, it was under $100. And that's exactly what it is...a $100 piece of useless electronics.It ruined 1 of my child's favorite DVD's because the DVD somehow jumped off the spinner and got scratched while spinning on the player's inner electronics. The only way was I was able to get the DVD out of the player was to unscrew the top and remove most the of pieces to remove the DVD.I've also had problems with skipping & many movies become ""pixelated"". This DVD player does not like scratches on DVD's or CD's (which caused the pixelation).I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, and I'll will never purchase any type of Toshiba home audio/video equipment again."
1,Toshiba SD-5915,This product has always done screwy things like skipping disks and random ejects. Current problem is opening and closing without stopping. Unplugging the unit does not reset it. Looks like a dumpster product now.
4,"A Miracle, an Angel ... A powerhouse in a little girl",Narada Michael Walden had the beat that we were moving to in high school.( Remember `I know Everythings gonna be alright...Tonight'..hey if you're reading this you know it - Stacy's song `Jump to the Beat' from NMW's album is not on this cd) Stacy Lattisaw was his special protege and her voice was clear strong and wonderful. `Miracle' in my book is still an all-time great. She teamed up well with Johnny Gill - it really seemed like a `Perfect Combination'. She really was our angel as school children.Wherever you are Stacy Lattisaw I wish you the best. This CD contains her best and is a worthwhile addition to a collection.
3,The Very Best with No Jump To The Beat!,"Ok, first facts first; there is No Jump To The Beat!!! One of her biggest hits, if not the biggest (especially in the UK). So why call it the Very Best of, although there are some sweet songs here to keep a listener satisfied. And a beautiful rendition of My Love wins hands down. Had Jump been included I'd have given it 5 stars, but now I'll have to track down that song somewhere else. I guess this is why people end up downloading for free."
3,"SO,SO","I will start of by saying that i think that Stacy Lattisaw is a superb artist. I am the same age as stacy lattisaw and bought the album ""let me be your angel"" when i was thirteen, it still is a briliant album. But this album is not a true representation of stacy's songs after all it would not be right without ""jump to the beat"" and ""dreaming"" on it. I think this a dreadful oversite of the record company."
4,Good to have all of these now on CD!,"For those of us who grew up with Stacy Lattisaw back in the 80s, this CD is a great way to replace all of those old 45s with the clear sound of CD. As a fan, I can say that this CD is great and brings back many memories. I only wish that it included more songs from her ""With You"" album like ""Feel My Love"" and ""It Was So Easy."" It's a really good CD and if you have any of her 45s, this would be a great way to replace them with something that will not only last longer, but will continue to possess that outstanding CD quality sound."
4,Heart-piercing youthful voice.,"I still have a hard time listening to ""Miracles"" without having tears come to my eyes. Very moving song, very well done, very poignant voice. Her two remakes of 1970 cover tunes--""Love On A Two Way Street"" and ""Hey There Lonely Boy [/Girl]""--are also quite powerful, and better than the originals. I think her youthfulness (she was 16 when ""Miracles"" was released) added an emotional edge and special sound to her singing that other singers can't match. Other songs in this collection were a lot more mundane and trite, especially her attempt at rap in ""Attack of the Name Game"" and the various '80s dance music songs. The included booklet has interesting coverage of her history (she doesn't sing secular music anymore) and some nice photos."
5,i want her let me be your angel tape,"if there is anyone out there that has her ""let me be your angel"" tape or know where i can retrieve it, please email me"
3,The c.d. needed to include more of her previous hit songs,"I love Stacy Lattisaws' music but I feel that her greatest hits c.d. didn't exemplify many great songs that she sang in previous years as well as the more recent years. The ""Perfect Combination C.d."" had some wonderful songs that weren't even on the c.d. I think that there were a couple songs from that c.d. but it could have been more. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the c.d. but it just didn't do her justice."
5,Book Two Of An Excellent Series,"Volume Two has three other novels.Spawn Of The Winds In The Moons Of Borea ElysiaThese books continue following the adventures of Crow and DeMarigny.Spawn Of The Winds is interesting though. While it still goes with the series, Lumley creates altogether new characters and heroes for this adventure and barely mentions Crow or DeMarginy at all! They do tie in later though, and quite nicely.This is another great series put together by Lumley, and I'm just so happy they finally rereleased some of his earlier work, and economically too.A related book of short stories that fits in nicely with this series is The Compleat Crow.Big tip! If you are like me and want to read virtually all of Lumley's works, then I highly suggest reading the Dreamlands saga after reading Spawn Of The Winds in Mythos Omnibus Volume Two. These books take place before In The Moons Of Borea (Unfortunately I did not know this and well, it blew it a little for me I think)."
5,"Great Program, Great Performances","I'm not sure which album the previous reviewer was writing about, since this disc does not contain anything by Janacek -- the one I'm playing now has the Divertimento by Bartok and that composer's arrangement of his Romanian Folk Dances, plus the Pulcinella Suite and Dumbarton Oaks Concerto of Stravinsky. Anyway, this essentially neoclassical program is performed in what I think is fine style by the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Indeed, the selections on this disc fit together so well that success would virtually be guaranteed even with a somewhat average ensemble, but the Orpheus players ratchet it up at least a couple notches more. I think these are among the best recordings of Pulcinella and the Divertimento, and when you put them together with the other two, you have gold, period. Highly recommended."
4,A triumph for modern day German cinema,"This enigmatic drama is a story of a young woman who confronts her ambitions and insecurities head on. The film starts with Yella accepting a new job and moving to the more modernized western part of the country. With hopes for a better future, the life she leaves behind include her loving father, her obsessive husband, and the stability of a reality understood.Christian Petzold uses a bold no frills approach to exhibit this thought provoking film. The narrative has a minimalistic quality which serves the film well, allowing the viewer to focus on the subtle yet compelling performance by actress Nina Hoss. Yella is an intelligently layered film and a triumph for modern day German cinema."
3,Accountancy on the edge,"Petzold is only partially successful with this moody examination of love and corruption, where plot is sidelined in favour of mood and enigma. Now, there's nothing wrong with that: I love riddle-like movies that often alienate others, but here the meat of the movie is too slight to carry the mystery. Yella's experiences on her vaguely picaresque journey fail to compel in the way intended. It's never boring but most of the fascination is supplied by Hoss's reticent performance, which is wistful and haunting. Another failure is the final twist, which is all too obvious quite early on and produces a sigh rather than a gasp. But overall this movie somehow manages the hold the attention and is worth watching, if only for Hoss's performance."
1,Warning Thematic Content,"(1.) The DVD needs a warning, particularly to non-German audiences, because this abstract (meaning - it's so obscure you can read whatever you want into it) parable has allusions embedded in German history and economics.(2.) Filmed largely in a car being driven from one room to another (total of about four rooms). A woman (Yella) is looking for a job, has had a bad marriage, stole some money, died in a car accident.(3.) Acting - hard to say since half of the movie focused on Yella sitting and essentially not doing much. Except close-ups suggest that the audience should look for deep subtle facial expressions.(4.) I suggest that if one needs to spend 90 minutes in some profound activity better to read any book or go for a walk."
3,abrupt ending for second workout,"I like the first workout on this DVD (Walk & Firm with Interval Training) but I am really disappointed with the second workout. It ends abruptly during the cool down walk. I even purchased another copy of the DVD thinking the problem was with the individual DVD. Not so, the second DVD does the same thing. I see from reading the other reviews that this seems to be a situation common to the entire DVD production."
3,Disappointed in bonus walk,"I love Leslie Sansone videos and wanted this one to give more variety to my workouts. The bonus 1-mile walk ends abruptly, in fact mid-sentence. At first I thought my CD was defective, but checked the time display and it ended at 0, also, another reviewer noted the same thing."
3,Not my favorite,"This is the 3rd Leslie Sansone DVD purchased but not my favorite. I got a good enough workout, but the camera work isn't the greatest. I liked working with the bands but wish she had a group with her. The Bonus Mile seemed to just stop during the stretching section."
3,the long awaited..,"I was very excited to get this DVD that I had preordered, as I enjoy Leslie Sansone and truly love her workouts. But.. I have to say, this was very hard to get into/keep into.It was actually boring. She's alone in the DVD. And truthfully, I will give it another shot. I did not complete the entire workout.Then I went forward to the bonus mile. It's a workout that's already available to purchase, something with senior citizens."
2,Disappointed,"I have several Leslie Sansone videos that I like very much, but this is not one of them. It's great to get the resistance bands, but she does not use them enough to provide any real firming. There are very few exercises using them. When they are used, there aren't enough reps to train muscles.The one-mile segment begins with an endless intro to walking by Dr. Ken Cooper. This is clearly filler material that provides no new information. I mean, if we didn't know that walking is good exercise, we wouldn't have purchased the video. The actual walk, for ""Active Adults"", is very easy and boring. It ends abruptly--Leslie is in the middle of a sentence! Very poor editing.Leslie needs to take a break and learn some new techniques before doing more videos. She has saturated the market with products that do not provide the promised workouts."
4,"Pansonic 5 3/8"" Saw Blade","The Panasonic saw bledes work wonderfully. No viberation, cut clean, last quite well concidering we cut wood, MDF,particle bd., harwood veneer panels, Corian, laminate and many framing and other building materials. Price is a little steep but so the quality warrants it."
4,exercices,"ce sont des pièces étranges qui ne se trouvent mme pas dans les intégrales Brahms car on estime qu'il s'agit de purs exercices. C'est effectivement le cas le plus souvent mais par moment, des relations musicales inattendues émergent, harmoniquement, rythmiquement, dans la conduite des voix ou dans la faculté de nous faire passer dans des mondes parallèles au niveau perceptif qui nous enseigne sur la faon de produire du sens à partir de dispositifs au départ non seulement exclusivement formels mais très systématiques"
3,For completists,"Surely the musical value of these exercises is relative. The point is: how many times will you crave to listen to this again? Some of us do not have 70 minutes of life to spare. For that matter, T'd listen to the rest of the master's piano oeuvre! So, as a curisotiy: yes. As a way to complete Naxos' traversal of Brahms music: of course!But my main complaint is that the individual tracks are not listed. And THAT is a shame. This was released in 1996; Naxos has improved tremendously on its production values. So this remains annoying for those of us interested."
2,Unneccesarily complex,"This has great anecdotes in it, but I keep getting bogged down in the syntax of the telling and the enormous cast of characters. Each time I put it down I have to re-read the last several pages so I can figure out what the hell is going on.Normally, I'd have put it in the library donation box, since I wasn't really into it by about the 50th-75th page. Instead, I keep reading, since I've (possibly foolishly) gotten the impression that, while fictitious, this gives a good account of the history of the crusades and its cast of characters."
2,Lights! Camera! Action! Blood! Yummy!,"Essentially a yawner. I couldn't believe this was the same Evan S. Connell who had me spellbound with Son of the Morning Star. If you buy into the book's conceit -- an authentic diary/tale of sorts from some chap about whom I could care less -- well and good. But look for a real slog a la Cold Mountain. I found myself thinking several times, Hey! Didn't I read about this (or these) particular slaughter(s) ten pages ago? Nope, brand new atrocities. One or two per page. And if you can keep track of more than two or three characters throughout this book, you're a better mental juggler than I am. I counted eleven new historical figures in the space of two pages! Was I to remember them? Would they be coming back later in the book? I guess Connell gets some credit for unearthing all this historical jacalap but it just rolls off the pages, word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, page after page until you say to yourself, Enough! Deus lo volt."
1,Too Boring for Me,"One of the amusing conceits of this novel is that it is written from the point of view of a real Crusader, and expresses all the prejudices, religious dogma, and ethnic hatred of such a compaigner. All infidels' souls fall ""screaming into the pit of eternal fire"" as the Saracens die. But Christians, even when they die while doing a little of their own raping and pillaging, ascend straight to the arms of God. But once you get past this, there isn't much else there. I seldom give up on a book once I start it, but if anything happened past page 150, someone else will have to tell me about it, because that's where I stopped. This story is boring, boring, boring. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
2,Disappointing,"Writing a book in the ""voice"" of a medieval writer is an interesting but flawed idea. As a result, the book provides neither the context, sweep and intrepretation that a modern history would provide nor the personalization and immediacy that a novel would yield. The book becomes an endless repetition of gory barbaric acts interspersed with religous exhortations appropriate for the time. Save your money-it get two stars for the ingenuity of the concept and admiration for the research involved."
1,What a stinker!,"I read approximately one book each day and tend to be forgiving of authors' faults but this one...what a stinker! It seems like one long run-on sentence. And frankly, a lot of what it says is just plain offensive. I am not a Catholic, nor a crusader, nor a Moslem but this book is just revolting in the things said about all three of those categories. For that matter, I am not a cannibal either, and even cannibals would be offended by this author's claims."
3,"Interesting, but I prefer Agori's novel","This book relies on the traditional view of the Crusades. Too bad. The novel Defenders of the Holy Grail (with its great songs) relates more to current research and ties Jesus' family to the Crusader effort. Connell write well, but his ""facts"" are suspect. remember the Pope back then was whoever was strongest in Rome, and Godfrey's own uncle had been one of the Popes!! Get this, but get a copy of Defenders also."
2,BORING!,"Sorry folks, I could only make it through the first 50 pages before I found that reading the ads posted on the walls of the train were more exciting than this book. If you're looking for a complex dissertation (boring) on the Crusades, then this book is for you. If you want an interesting book with an exciting story about Medieval times, read Crichton's Timeline."
3,No Mercy,"Everything you ever wanted to know about the Crusades, but didn't know to ask. This work is filled with facts and trivia, that is fascinating in the short term, but difficult to sustain the readers' interest over its length. The narrative is much less engaging than the author's earlier work on Custer. His research is to be commended. There was little virtue on either side of these conflicts and we thank the Lord not to have been chosen to participate. Sex and violence for the greater glory of ...?"
3,"Fantastic, but I'm a little confused........","This was an EXCELLENT book. It gives a great history right down through ALL of the crusades, but something left me a little confused - isn't this just a rewriting of Jean, Sire de Joinville's chronicle on the Crusades? Why is this never alluded to? Not on inside or outside cover, nor in any preamble! I'd be pretty upset if I were the real author! God rest his soul. Nonetheless a book well worth reading. It gives a good feel for what was going on. I'd like to see more books like this!"
5,People are way too critical,"This game is supposed to be fun, not complicated. I mean how serious could they be if you can pimp your own girls and crap like that. The racing end of it doesn't compare to NFSU but it has much more. One thing is they have actual cities which is one thing I hated about NFSU which just had some random scenery. Also the performance upgrades are way better, with much more options. You can drive around the city looking for races and can also get busted by the cops which I thought was tight and creative. Unlike other reviewers I thought it was a good thing that there was no hondas or acuras. Not because I hate them since I have an Acura Integra myself. But they are the most common modified imports on the street so I was glad to see other cars. Such as the Lexus IS 300 which I was hoping to see on a racing game. All in all I think you should get this ig you just want to have fun with it and not take it so seriously like other people. I definitley recommend it."
3,street racing syndicate,this game started off pretty slow but after playing for hours on in it got better. the cars did not look that great like GT but not bad game play is fun and the real life girl videos make up its short falls.
1,this game is just like NFSU,"I was really excited to see this game on the shelf the day it came out and personally I'm a bit upset with the outcome of this one. It is almost like Need for speed underground but with tons less of parts and manufactures to choose from. the cars performance on screen does not give you that in depth speed and sound that NFSU does either. the cartoon graphics too. overall if you don't have need for speed underground, that would be a much better title than this and if you do have that then don't get this one, you'll just be upset. remakes are not cool. this game gets 2 thumbs down. crap!!"
5,A Buzzard is my Best Friend,"I first borrowed this book from the library in Casper, Wyoming. Was browsing for a good book and the title intrigued me. Needless to say I could not put the book down, I laughed so hard I cried, then in the sad times I cried till the tissue box was empty. I read the book twice before taking back to the library and then some years later tried to borrow it again but disappointed that it was no longer available till I found it through Amazon.com, I bought it. Now I want to order it for a dear friend who is moving to a rual area in Kentucky. I know she will love it as much as I have. I only wish I could find more books out there with the same real to life hopes, joys,and sorrows that happen in every day life but build character and fill us with wisdom that working with and appreciating the animal kingdom can bring us. Margaret Barnes, this is my most favorite book 2nd only to my Bible and is close at hand on my bed side stand- you are the best."
4,The 914 Haynes guide is second only to the factory guides!,"If you own a 4 cylinder Porsche 914 and wish to perform much of the required maintenance yourself, this book is a ""must have.""Second only to the factory maintenance guides, the Haynes guide provides a thorough guide for ALL 6 model years and offers a fairly complete troubleshooting guide. Some of the standard Haynes problems exists (i.e.: ""Reinstallation is the reverse of removal"" and mislabelled photos), but the majority of these can be figured out by simply examining what you are trying to accomplish first hand instead of depending on the book too heavily.I recommend this guide to ALL 914 owners that visit the 914 Fan Web Page (http://www.estinc.com/porsche/)."
5,It's what I expected,"An uncomplicated product that works. The sound is great, and it only took a few minutes to hook it up once I realized I had the cords mixed up. I enjoy listening to cds on the DVD player. The only thing about it is that it rewinds a bit too much, and you have to press twice to stop it. Other than that, I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
4,Almost New,"It's not almost new.I mistaked the address and they returned the item when it arrived back. Good service, althought I would like to have had the choose of the kind of send and not to pay it like."
2,Simply ok.,"Flavor was ""tired"" as the spice seemed dry even for a dry spice. Taste was extremely weak for such a robust, dominant, spice! I love Cilantro! I did not like this one! I do not recommend this brand or item.!"
2,DIDN'T TASTE OR SMELL LIKE FRESH CILANTRO,"~ I bought this product thinking I would have lots of fresh cilantro which I love, but when I smelled it or used it, it was just plain bland like all the smell & taste had been dry sucked out of it. I won't buy it again, however their saltless pizza seasoning was excellent, especially with salmon."
1,"lousy product, lousy company, lousy customer service","Like the previous reviewer, we too, had a Melnor traveling sprinkler that worked great 25 years ago. They definitely don't make 'em like they used to, and this sprinkler is a complete waste of a lot of money. No wonder the company doesn't stand behind their products -- even they know it's not worth it.The sprinkler worked fine for the first few times, so I thought I was having better luck. But within a month it just stopped, and no amount of tightening, checking or prodding will get it going again. If I had the time or inclination to babysit a sprinkler, I would have bought one for $20, not $60. You're paying for the convenience it supposedly offers -- to set it and leave it to do its thing.To make things worse, Melnor's customer service response was to ask me to send the mechanism back (at my expense of course.) Now I know why so few stores carry their products."
3,Firetruck Traveling Sprinkler,"As a sprinkler, this item works well. I was a little disappointed at how fast the paint faded on the body."
4,Great for flat ground,This tractor works great on flat ground with a good soft grass. If your grass is not lush you will have a hard time getting it to move. It seems well built and heavy.
2,I Agree With Brett Packer!,"Dont bother wasting your money on this Luxt cd. I dont really like both Anna Christine and Erie Loch singing on one song, like they do on this cd............. I really recommend Chromasex Monkeydrive. Buy this cd if you listened to clips of the songs on this cd and you like it............though that probably wont happen."
4,James Bible Study,This is a good in depth study of the book of James. I am enjoying the extra definitions of words used in the scripture. It is very helpful in understing the message. The explanation of the translation of some Greek words is also helpful.
1,Terrible Kindle Formatting,"I picked this up on the Kindle for a small-group study, but had to buy a hard copy, as the formatting made reading difficult and ruined my ability to converse with my small group. I'm not entirely certain that I'm not reading a drastically revamped text, since I'm often unable to find passages my group is talking about.An example: The text will have a few verses of James, accompanied by explanations of key terms, often with reference to nuances in the meaning of the original Greek. That's fabulous. The Kindle version, however, gives the reader a couple verses, a page or two of blank space (but for a vertical line down the screen) and then some of the definitions, effectively removing the definitions from their context and making comprehension prohibitively difficult.I have no qualms with the hard-copy version. It's just the Kindle adaptation that frustrates me."
2,Kindle version is not the same as the print version,"I bought the Kindle version of this book to use in a small group Bible study; the rest of the group is using the printed version. I have done this previously when we used a MacArthur Bible Study, and it worked well. Based on that experience, I bought the James study book. I found out while meeting to discuss the first lesson that the Kindle version is very different from the rest of the class. That is because the Kindle version is from the 1998 print version; the book was revised and re-released in 2007.I don't know why the Kindle version of James is not the 2007 edition, especially when other books in the series have released the newer versions for Kindle. It's very disappointing to have to write a bad review because of something like this, but I can't give it good marks. It's unacceptable that the older version is being sold on Kindle when it would be as easy to provide the newer one."
3,Tuffrider Pants,"These pants are both warm and nice looking. However, they 'rub' and 'wear' much too easily. I have only worn mine once but there are already rub marks from where the pants touched my nylon horn bag. I was more than a little disappointed about this since they are very expensive pants. I will have to look further to find my perfect winter riding pants."
2,Short on details,"I regretably returned this book since it did not describe how home improvements should be done but instead it just describes what needs to be done. The book read more like an encylopedia than a ""do-it-yourself"" manual - lots of information but not very helpful. I much prefer Standley's home repair manual which describes, for instance, how to caulk or different techniques for sanding."
5,fascinating stories of army life in manchuria under mao,"engrossing, elegantly written stories. Ha jin's prose is addictively easy to read (i gobbled it up in one sitting)...sign me up for his next book!"
4,Very interesting,"I'm very critical of some Chinese writers like Amy Tan for their distortions of a life they haven't experienced. But this doesn't apply to Ha Jin, who survived the Revolution and was a soldier. I really like this collection of stories because Ha Jin excels in writing vignettes by injecting fresh details. Anyone who is curious about Communist China should read this book. Skip his novels though."
1,Not enough examples,"Okay, maybe I'm just dumb, but this book barely has any examples besides the few problems at the end of each chapter. The book is full of equations and not enough explanation. I would not recommend taking this class or buying this book. Of course, if you're an EE student at UC Davis, this class (EEC140A) is required. So, tough luck. All I can tell you is... don't slack off. Attend the lectures, and don't fall behind. I found the materials to be pretty difficult. There's no way around it. Study."
1,Stay away!,"This is terrible text. I am currently studying for a midterm and there are no examples and the authors write at a level that would not be acceptable for high school. The material is hard enough, but this book makes understanding it just that much more difficult. I hope the only schools that actually use this text are the two where the authors teach. I bet the good review was left by one of the authors."
1,Be careful of this DVD - it's a copy,"Reflections was a TV special, I think. The DVD ""Dusty"" and another one are copies of Reflections. I bought all 3 and told Amazon to see about these as these were frauds, direct copies.Buy Reflections and the Albert Hall concert, and leave the rest of them alone, unless you want 3 copies of the same thing.Dusty is fabulous as always but this DVD is not."
1,Extremely uncomfortable,Most snowboard boots i've used use a liner or are seamless on the inside. These are not. The are where they sewed the lip on protrudes on the inside of the boot. They dig into your toes and the top of your foot. Making for a very painful run down the mountain.
2,WWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,"Hi there.Do you like movies with incredibly bad acting?Do you enjoy watching a movie thats cut together so bad you could swear your 3 year old kid could film something better?Do you like watching actors run into a room and stand perfectly still while they say there dialog?Do you like incredibly boring long montages every 5 minutes?Do you want to see a familly comedy movie that is in no way at all funny?Do you want to watch a beautiful young girl with only one name who amazingly had no acting career after this film and seems to have disapeered off the face of this earth?Do you wanna see Maniac Cop have the stupidest showdown in history while balancing on balloons and shaming the 3 stooges?Do you have an I.Q under 0.1?Then this movie is perfect for you.EDIT: I apologise for the two star vote, i accidently chose the wrong one. I meant 0 stars."
2,Children's section,"Halfway through the book I knew something wasn't quite right.The story is fair enough and it has enough reasonable ideas and plotlines to carry it. But either it's intended for kids (despite it's length) or it needs a more adult writer to make it work.It's not a bad book but if you are above a certain age and have read a fair bit of science fiction you're probably not going to want to buy book 2. Read yes, but not buy...."
3,It's ok,"I think this book (and the whole series) falls into an uncomfortable spot between hard and soft science fiction. It has some elements that are very believable, but other parts are just ridiculous. Most of the characters are pretty 2-dimensional in my opinion.Overall, an entertaining but somewhat hackish book, as with the others I've read in the series so far."
2,Good story - no meat,"I had high hopes for this series, so I bought the first book and after reading it I'm glad I didn't buy any others. While the story is excellent, the individual characters become lost. I found myself rooting for the hydrogues. The book spends far too much time on the leaders and their political motives then on the more interesting characters who, as I said, are severely lacking. There were only a few characters that I found interesting and they only had minor parts in the book, and after looking up what happens to those specific characters in the later books I discovered I don't want to continue the series. I would recommend getting this title from your local library to try it out before making any purchases."
4,Very good,"I thought this book was very good. I had it a few years back until it was stolen so I ordered it again. I think the characters were very well written and their relationships with one another interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who loves scifi. Yes there may be some things in it that others have already written, but who writes anything that is really original these days? I like Kevin J Anderson and especially like his work on the Dune novels. This book also shipped to me within two days."
3,Just...OK,"There are 7 books in this series and they are all the same...slow, plodding, too many characters you don't care about, the bad guys never seem to really get there due when they are stopped, many of the characters are complete morons, etc.Overall, it's ok, but definitely not a special series. Don't expect this book or series to grab you and hold you."
1,Depressing,"It's depressing that a writer with the obvious lack of talent of Kevin Anderson is obviously making a mint of money. It's also depressing that the hard science fiction scene is at such a low ebb that I, a sci-fi fan for more than 40 years, picked up this book to satisfy my habit although being well aware of the level of Mr. Anderson's talents from the abominable Dune sequels.Despite some interesting plot concepts, this novel is truly awful. The numerous faults of this novel have been previously mentioned: dialogue that could be bettered by Doc Smith, characters that are (almost to a man, woman, or alien) denser than Forrest Gump, and chapters that cut faster than an MTV video. And while I have never required (and actually tend to dislike) the elaborate scientific explanations for future technology that often accompanied Golden Age sci-fi (when many authors were moonlighting scientists), the utter ridiculousness of an open decked ship in the atmosphere of a gas giant made my eyes goggle."
1,An Utter Waste of Time,"Where do I begin? This has to be one of the worst written books I have ever read. I love science fiction, particularly hard sf and space opera, so I was really looking forward to this series. Instead, I struggled to finish the first book. I kept waiting for the story line to hook me in, but it never happened. There are way too many characters, and they all make cardboard look like it has a vivid personality. If publishers wonder why they are inundated with half-baked manuscripts, publishing garbage like this is the reason why. It just leaves the average reader thinking ""Hey, I could have written something better than this!""."
1,Fantasy in disguise,"The writing is so-so, with most characters staying flat and no real suspense building. There are frequent major logic goofs. Example: The author has the captain of a war vessel comment that sacrificing a single man to obtain fuel that could power the whole fleet for weeks was not worth it, with the fleet being starved for fuel. This is completely unrealistic and stupid.The other thing, and this is the one I really cannot forgive, is that these books are fantasy masking as SF and only showing its true flag in later books. It has elementals fighting each others. It has less and less technology. By book 3, I am ready to leave this unfinished and will mark it down as a big disappointment."
2,Some good storytelling... but sadly overshadowed.,"I think the author was overly ambitious, trying to hold and synchronize too many story threads simultaneously. As a result you get to enjoy some solid storytelling but then have to wade through entire chapters of frustratingly bad story. Character decision making is schizophrenic - an artifact of characters being forced along a predetermined plot line I suspect. Not only do you see what's going to happen - because the predictable plot makes it obvious - but the author then makes you suffer through pages of characters trying to justify their inconsistent decisions. I think the author realized he was ruining his characters for the sake of an overly complex plot... but he did it anyway."
3,Frustrating then satisfying,Anderson's book seems to take many many pages in order to get to the point...If you plan on reading this book plan on reading 350 pages before the book starts to come together and become enjoyable. That is why I am only giving it three stars. The book has so many characters that it is hard to keep track of them and who is who. Thank the higher power for the index in the back.I was surprised by the stupidity of the humans and not being able to put together the turning the gas giant into a sun with the attacks on the sky mines.After page 350 the book really developed and I had a hard time putting it down. Can't wait to read the next one.
3,"Lotsa good ideas, but it goes on, and on, and on...","There are some fun plot and setting ideas here, but the book doesn't really feel like it makes much progress. Partly that's because this is just the first 100 or so chapters of a megabook, but partly because there's not much emotional development. I'm a longtime fan of hard SF, but I had a hard time getting through this one."
4,"Surprisingly, I enjoyed this book.","As the title of my review implies, I am not Kevin Anderson's biggest fan. I have been thoroughly dissapointed with his work in the Dune prequels. BUT, I am a big enough man to admit that in this case he did a fine job. Its not a ground breaking work of literature, its not a deep or profound work of literature. Its just a fun read. A good adventure story. If you want an entertaining story to take you away from a boring day. I definitely suggest you pick this book up."
4,Sensational Space Opera,An exciting space opera filled with interesting characters and fascinating aliens and exciting action. Hidden Empire is a galaxy spanning space opera epic with multiple plotlines and an intriguing cliffhanger. It's a little slow in place but overall it flows quickly. Anderson has created an interesting universe here. A great fun read. Recommended for Star Trek and Star Wars fans or fans of light sci-fi space opera.
1,I won't be reading any sequels to Hidden Empire,"Wow, is this really the same Kevin Anderson that along with Brian Herbert wrote all the Dune novels after Frank Herbert's death? Those are some of the best SF I've ever read, but Hidden Empire is so bad I will not be reading any of the rest of the Saga of Seven Suns series. Too bad, I really like space opera as a sub genre in SF, but this book was so bad I had to force my self to finish it because MAYBE something really great will happen and the story will take off. Well...nothing great happened. I would say don't waste your time with the rest of the series, but since I haven't actually read the rest of the book, I don't know, go ahead if you want to...wait! It is a waste of time to read the rest of these books."
2,"Simple-minded characters, needless detail, badly edited","The Saga of Seven Suns series starts off with a the bold promise of delivering an epic space opera but instead delivers a meandering plot bogged down with pointless descriptions. The series was a gift...I would never have read beyond the first book otherwise. It is tolerable of you skim or skip over chapters. Through the many predictable plot twists and turns, Anderson creates unrealistically dumb characters. Anderson fails to make their various errors believable and instead invests too heavily in over-detailed descriptions of the setting. This series is also the victim of poor editing. The entire story could have been effectively told in three books instead of seven...the rest is pointless fluff and tedious plot manipulation. A tighter story would have been more entertaining and gripping (though perhaps less profitable with fewer books to sell). I will be very cautious about purchasing from this author again."
1,Badly Executed,"An interesting premise, but I found it difficult to plough on through the badly paced narrative, poor dialogue and one-dimensional characters who I didn't believe in behaving as if their IQ is negative. I won't be bothering with the sequels."
2,"Weak dialogue and characters, But great World Design","Anderson has a good knack for world building -- creating interesting political structures, cultures, social dynamics, and so on.However, he's weak, at least in this book, at creating characters that you want to empathize with and/or which feel real. He is similarly poor at writing dialog, and most of his characters seem to speak in one of two or three modes -- very little distinct personality is shown.The mortal sin of writing he commits repeatedly is to ""Tell"" you what someone is about, or what a situation is as opposed to ""Show"" you. His characters frequently say what they are about with technical terminology.. it's very odd. It's a damn shame too because his world is pretty cool and have a lot of promise.First book I've been unable to finish in a long time... and I really tried -- 100 pages from the end.Maybe his next series will be better..."
5,amazing,"all i can say is amazing, where i live i have only just got the first volume and i am looking for the new ones, cannot wait"
1,Science? what's that?,"I tried to read this book and didn't make it past the first couple of chapters. You have a ship flying in the upper levels of a gas giant mining hydrogen? ok, that works.The ship has an outside deck? ok, under a force field i assume.Nope, it is in the open air and the crew can go out for a breath of fresh air. And there are birds that never land anywhere except on this deck. Yes you can find a level in the atmosphere where the pressure is earth sea level, but it won't be breathable air! You're mining hydrogen at that level! You think there would be oxygen in a human usable concentration? What about the gases causing all the interesting colored clouds, like hydrocholoric and sulfuric acid vapor? Not to mention mixing hydrogen and oxygen at earth pressure and temp (can you spell B O O M?)Threw the book away, it's not even worth trying to sell to the used book store because then I would inflict this pain on someone else."
4,Not an Introductory Book,"As with all of Hacking's books, it is well written and researched. However, it is not nearly as simple to understand as some of his other writings. I have taken courses one course each in logic, philosophy of psychiatry, and linguistics, and have done a good deal of reading on my own. That did NOT suffice. There is much discussion of early modern philosophy. I would not recommend this book unless you have some background in Hobbes, Locke, Descartes, etc., as well as some knowledge of twentieth century contemporary analytic philosophy.This book is just barely out of the reach of someone who is interested and an avid reader. Something along the lines of a minor in philosophy is needed."
3,Not as advertised,The product description states that this battery is 1.9 amp/hour capacity. The battery I received is 1.2 amp/hour capacity. These batteries are available for less money many other places.
3,Broadening the duo piano/orchestra repertoire,"clean, crystal clear performance of two lovely works by one of the world's greatest composers. It's not breathtaking, spellbounding virtuosity here but it's lovely playing with faithful accompaniment from the orchestra."
1,Cookie-cutter receipes & Hallmark cards language,"Whatever message the author is conveying gets lost in the third-rate ""story"" in this fable. Quoting: ""I noticed that I really didn't give a flying *** if my thougts sounded like a Hallmark card."" Well, most characters' thought did. The company VP gives a rousing speech, and the whole company ""connects."" Etc. All of the book sounded like a contraption far from the real world."
5,Great LEAP- Distribute to Mgmt Team,I just finished Radical Leap within a week after receiving . . . you can easily get through this book in a matter of a few hours. Great story and content to help you get the most out of your organization. Well-organized - with specific questions at the back of the book to put the words into practice . . .
4,Corporate Rise,"The ""Radical Leap"" provides a good overview for personal leadership. However, it does not provide enough specificity for someone really interested in reaching the top of his or her organization. I still believe it is a good book, but I would suggestCorporate Rise: The X Principles of Extreme Personal Leadershipas a must read book."
1,Good Advice for the Simple Minded,"Rediculous book, written on a 5th grade level for those who are inspired by motivational posters and achievement buttons.Recap of the book: a nationally recognized specialist in Corporate Leadership becomes the student of a beach bum (fictional), who knows ""William Maritime.. a veritible business god. He was kind of a cross between a less flamboyant Richard Branson and a less explosive Ted Turner with a dash of Mother Teresa thrown in for depth"" (also fictional) who happens to be living in a trailer park.If a black framed poster of men rowing in the fog with a snappy caption is enough to change your professional life, grab a couple copies of this book"
5,excellent,"This book is a must read for everyone everwhere. It is not just for business, but for life. A fun, entertaining read."
4,"Refreshing, inspiring and entertaining..","If Steve Farber doesn't get you excited about leadership in this fun well written story, you may want to check for a pulse. You may need medical attention. Steve writes this short read with genuine enthusiasm. The characters are easy to connect with, the parables feel real and it is just plain fun. Personally, I love the OS!M concept, building a great business requires risk, risk can cause fear. Embrace OS!M from time to time and you may find your able to go places you never thought possible. If you dig this little book, I'll bet your co-workers dig you. Not much on practical advice, but very engaging and entertaining. Just order it! Any comments are welcome."
5,NOT your ordinary Leadership book,"Yes, another leadership book and no, not another BORING leadership book. This 180 or so page book brings some great laughter and some thought provoking questions to challenge any leader at every level, formal or informal. It is a quick read but at the same time requires the reader to really stop; think and reflect.Steve does a great job narrating a fictional story to send his message home. The acronym LEAP, standing for Love, Energy, Audacity, and Proof, is the foundation of Steve's message. This is some of the same ""leadership stuff"" we hear and read everyday but with a marvelous twist of humor and real down to earth, from the heart, advice.At the end of the book is a great 13 page guide to the Radical LEAP, with great questions for the reader to reflect upon.This book is sure to be used as a reference for all leaders in their own internal reflection and how they see themselves fitting into their organization and world."
4,Good deal!,"good deal, because it was cheap, and connected perfectly to my computer and printer. Though it took a while to arrive may be almost 2wks ( can't remember exact)."
4,Endearing story about a smudgy old bear,"This story of a teddy bear is quite endearing, and will appeal especially to toddlers and preschoolers. Theodore is the beloved stuffed bear of a young girl named Lucy, who is not overly fond of neatness. Anyway, the bear accidentally gets into the laundry pile and Lucy's dad unknowingly loads him into a washer at the Laundromat and then the dryer! Theodore faints at one point, and this might distress some young children who are very fond of their stuffed animals (luckily my 5-year-old realized that it was only make believe, otherwise I might never get her stuffed bunny washed ever again!).Theodore's adventures do not end here - he is uncomfortable in his 'new', clean fur and is distressed when Lucy (frantic at not knowing where he is) does not recognize the clean bear sitting in front of her. Theodore is determined to set things right, and the way he goes about it makes for fun reading! Recommended for ages 3-6."
3,Watch out,"If you ever want to wash your child's stuffed animals again, don't read them this book.The part where the bear ""blacks out"" in the washer is what really got me."
5,Quick Quick Quick,"I ordered the Wausau Paper AstroBright Color Laser/Inkjet Paper because one of my new employees had an issue with the color orange that I was using before. The color is amazing and makes all my black and stand out. It is luminescent!The best thing about this order was that I received it so quickly. I ordered it on Sunday and it came in on Wednesday. This was with Super Saver Free Shipping. The sad part is, the rest of my order hasn't shipped yet and will probably not be here for another week. That included some very important things that we need."
3,Too outdated,"This book has an excellent overview of the history of artificial intelligence (AI), but unfortunately it is too outdated now to be of real use to students. There is a short history of AI , and the development of computers, and an explanation of the turing test that is used as a test of AI. Although this book is touted as part of a series on opposing viewpoints, there is inadequate information on the pros and cons of AI. A few charts should have been added to clarify the key points especially since it is a children's book. You will learn some things by reading this book, such as the early history of computers, but it will leave you wondering what has happened in this ever changing field in the past 10 years."
5,"Review of ""Temple Grandin,"" the movie","Superb acting in a true story where every parent/friend of a patient afflicted, or that patient w/ autism or Asperger's Syndrome should strive to watch. Deeply moving and prompts us all to help fund the various Autism/Asperger's Syndrome Foundations."
4,Entertaining and inspiring,"Watched this movie with my wife and teen age daughters. The story of Temple Grandin was told in a very entertaining, as well as inspiring manner.Great movie for the whole family. That is a pretty rare statement in 2011."
5,remarkable life story,"This video does an excellent job of depicting the struggles Temple Grandin faced navigating through what we consider ""normal"" society, showing just how cruel people can be and also how kind many individuals were to her as she struggled to fit in. I was immediately intrigued by her after seeing her c-span interview and purchased this video for more insight into her truly amazing journey. She benefited greatly from the wonderful people who were willing to mentor her which highlights just how important mentors are."
5,Real outsider does well against prejudice and her handicaps,"Socially, emotionally handicapped Temple perseveres against her permanent weaknesses and peoples' prejudices. Beautifully photographed, thoughtful story-telling about people who think visually, about finding things that work for their well being and happiness. What if you lost something critical, say a a leg - how would you live, survive, mitigate your loss? This movie is also about parents, family, and friends who encourage the handicapped and wounded. I was greatly inspired. Highly recommend watching it a second time with the narration turned on where Temple, the director, and story writer talk about the movie scenes; also inspiring."
4,High functioning sect of Autism and creativity,"If you want to see how high functioning an autistic person can be, watch this movie. It sheds the light on real experience and true story exposing the struggle with autism and how it can be won against and live successful life with great achievements."
5,A great movie,This is a great movie. It is probably over looked by many but it's both interesting and inspiring. The director takes Temple's view of the world and shares it with the audience. A must see.
5,Temple Grandin,When I saw this production on HBO I was very impressed. I bought this for my adult children to watch. A fascinating look into autism.
5,Temple Grandin is a winner,Excellent performance by Clare Danes and ensemble and a solid script make this a great experience for almost any audience over 18.
5,Fantastic Movie - Highly Recommended,Clare Danes does an amazing job here. The movie is so well done and so powerful.Autism takes some of the fluff out of relating. I can't tell you how much I appreciated all the emotionaly honesty of this film.Watch this - you won't regret it.
5,Wow!,"You don't often see this kind of unanimity in Amazon reviews and I'm only going to add to it. Temple Grandin is superb in every respect, especially Claire Danes as the autistic title character. (And that is not at all to slight Julia Ormond as her mother, the always effective David Strathairn as her understanding and favorite high school teacher, and Catherine O'Hara as Aunt Ann, it's just that Danes's job in portraying a high-functioning autistic person is so much harder.) Temple Grandin works on every level -- as a portrait of autism, as a feel good story of overcoming a debilitating handicap, and, not least, as a snapshot of the 60s.In short, a great and, since it never had a theater release, somewhat under the radar movie."
4,Inspiring movie,"The movie about Temple Grandin is very positive about one person's path to not only cope but excell with Autism. A lot of credit needs to go to Temple's patient and dedicated Mother. The caring support her Aunt, High School Science Teacher and an understanding room mate also were part of Temples later attainment of influence and success in Animal handling and Autism treatment. Wonderful story and acting about a real and interesting person."
4,Fast and good service,"Very fast delivery, several days before I expected it.One little problem, when I try to watch this DVD on some computers, I have to change some kind of a country spesific zone ID to be allowed to play it. On other computers I am never asked to change this zone ID. May be amazon should inform foreign customers in what zones the DVD is allowed to be played."
5,I loved this movie,I really loved this movie - and what is so cool about it is how people who don't fit in the box are basically excluded from society because they are different than everyone else. But they often can see things other people can't see - and they experience the world differently than other people. I have had many of the same difficulties and I found this movie to be very encouraging - I really liked the movie's use of the door and going through the door - and how nobody was willing to be kind and patient with her but then there was someone who was willing to be kind and patient and that was all it took for her to face her fears and do something she was afraid to do and once she did that then other doors would open up. What I think is amazing about this is all it really takes to help a person is a few people who are willing to believe in you and to be patient with you
5,Thought-provoking & interesting depiction of a great American story,Thought-provoking topic. Interesting movie about the real life struggles of someone with autism. Claire Danes is a phenomenal actress in this movie. Pulls at your heart strings without being too depressing. Great Film.
4,Insightfull,Good acting to help understand in a small way the way an autistic person's thought and perception process is different from a non-autisitic person's.Rounds out the understanding I got from the books.
4,"A movie for horse buffs, animal advocates and families",had no idea how loving the message was in this movie. It was perfect for my family and made me smile. Great for horse lovers and families who care about their children.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"First rented this at a local movie rental place. After watching, just had to have it to see again and again! This is a charming movie that encompasses the struggles and challenges of life, opens you to new understanding of autism, but encourages us all. It is super ""family"" oriented movie.It makes you laugh and cry and come away with the challenge of, even though we might struggle, our dreams can be attained. Loved it so much...might just be on my top ten favorites now!"
4,Interesting DVD,Temple Grandin was autistic with such an amazing gift. You will just marvel over her work and passions in this movie about her life.
5,terrific!,Terrific movie. I was skeptical before I watched it but it was spot on. I have met temple Grandin in person and Claire Danes was perfect!
5,Great true story,"We saw this movie by flipping around on the TV and thought it was excellent. We wanted to show it to our grand kids but could not find when it would be shown again, so we ordered it on Amazon.We showed to our oldest grandson. He thoroughly enjoyed it.The quality of the picture was excellent in HD."
4,Temple Grandin,"Thouroughly enjoyed the visuals as well as the ingenious techniques she used to calm herself.I have a grandson, now 21, and we used a lot if those efforts to keep him calm and secure. I also have worked with a 13-year-old for the past seven years, and all of the new types of eqipment available. The movie is a wonderful tool for teaching thise who are predudiced or simply do not understand autism."
1,Not able to watch,I was not able to watch the movie /dvd . Because I live in the Netherlands it is not possible . Its another systeem we have here.
1,Temple Grandin,"Watched for the first time last week, the dvd must be scratched. The majority of the disk froze and restarted, froze and restarted, etc, etc. Not what I call 'viewing pleasure.' A notice on the disk said it was 'made in Mexico.' Is that how Amazon does business now? Very disappointing!!"
2,Temple Grandin,"Started off as a really good movie, but near the end there was a defect on the DVD, so, we were not able to finish watching the movie. We tried everything. Plus, we had waited too long to watch it so it was past the deadline to make a return."
2,"No German Verson on DVD, but to see at TV!","Hello, i loved this Film. I saw it on ARTE TV in Germany in German.Yes i love it and i need it. Because some People i Know MUST see itan understand me more! Okay maybe i not Authistic. But that not Important!Then i want buy a DVD in Germany and Amazon (germany) don't have it.Hier Amazon .com only in English and Spanish.Why i could see it on TV for Free and not Buy.what internet are for?"
1,What a Mess,"I purchased this dvd for my sister as a birthday gift. When I opened up the package and looked at the dvd case I was in shock somebody actually sold this to me. The dvd itself was fine but the case was ripped and broken into several pieces. I was very disappointed because it was a gift, but my sister was nice and took the dvd and threw away the mess of what used to be a case.I would have never bought this had I known it was going to be such a mess."
5,Amazing Woman,"I loved the whole story. This woman became a triumphant model for all women, and especially those of with with special needs. Any variety of learning challenge is only as successful as those dedicated to doing whatever works regardless of proscribed formulas. Opening the door wide for all learning abilities is how we can create a wonderful world."
5,Truth exceeds fiction,"I am someone who has no personal connection to anyone with autism, but I do think Temple Grandin's story is a valuable example for anyone who doesn't feel like they fit into mainstream society. She pushes through the anxiety of not belonging because of her personal vision, and need, to make some things right feels so intense. As is often the case, the true story of this person's life is far more inspiring than any fictional account. Claire Daines envelopes the character so well that you forget it's her, the actress. Instead, you enter the world of Temple Grandin -- a world that few people get to experience."
5,Interesting and entertaining,"Claire Danes does a fantastic job portraying Temple Grandin, a high-functioning autistic woman. Julia Ormond (mother) and Catherine O'Hara (aunt) add wonderfully to the mix, with characters that are challenged by Temple yet do whatever is needed to provide her a life worth living.And it is a life worth living...we see a 4-year old girl unable to talk grow into a highly-educated woman. Temple Grandin deals with bullying, teasing, prejudice and ignorance. She struggles to interpret social cues. She has difficulty relating to people. However, she also has an uncanny talent for interpreting patterns, a keen mind and a drive to succeed. Her story, and this movie, is an uplifting look at a person who capitalizes on her differences and achieves."
3,Not thrilled with this bead set.,"I purchased this for our 3yo to help her with her fine motor skills and thought she'd love making some jewelry of her own as she loves butterflys and felt that with M & D's quality craftsmanship this would last for quite a while to carry on with our twins when they reach an appropriate age. The overall craftsmanship is true to M & D's reputation, the threads have a firm plastic to help with threading of the beads, the packaging is solid, however, they over looked one thing. The holes in the butterflys are too long to allow the firm plastic on the treads to completely thread through so you are not able to thread the butterfly beads through once you remove the butterflys from the original string. Pretty disappointed with this M & D purchase and would return the product if able to."
3,design flaw,"This is a first: There is a design flaw with this beading kit. The aglets on the shoelaces are not long enough to go through the thickness of the butterflies (the butterflies are thicker than the aglet is long) so you are left trying to string a limp shoelace through a stiff bead. My granddaughter enjoys stringing the regular beads onto the shoelaces, and just plays with the butterflies. Kit should be redesigned with longer aglets on the ends of the shoelaces. I was disappointed to learn of this flaw as I purchased it as a Christmas gift and am just now learning of this. I would have returned it had I known."
1,Unattractive and smelly,"I ordered this for my young cousin, but was disappointed with it and actually returned it. I thought it would make a nice gift because it is creative and active, and unlike some other bead jewelry sets for kids, the relatively large wooden beads made it appropriate for younger children. Unfortunately, upon arrival I noticed the colors were ugly and also the box had a very strong smell of paint fumes. The colors were dark in tone-- dark goldenrod instead of bright cherry yellow, mossy green instead of bright green--and I didn't think they looked very pretty. And if that wasn't discouraging enough, the overpowering smell bothered me enough to send it back."
5,Another winner from Melissa & Doug!,"Not suprisingly, this is an adorable product. My daughter owns the heart version and my niece has these butterfly ones. I didn't experience any strange paint smells out of either one of these, and I would highly recommend them to anyone. The only thing that could make these kits better is if they added a handful of letter beads, as I bought some seperately. -Nevertheless, a great toy for crafty kids. ;)"
1,Very dissapointed...the butterfly beads are too wide to go onto the string!,"My daughter is really enjoying stringing things these days and I thought this would be a great next step for her. The reviews were all great except about the paint smell, which I wasn't worried about.My daughter was so excited to try these and I thought what great string it has plastic ends which will make it very durable and easy to string...until I tried one of the butterfly beads. The string goes in fine, but there doesn't seem to be anyway to get it all the way through the bead. Once you don't have the plastic to push on it get stuck 3/4 of the way through! So frustrating!!! Now I have to go through the trouble and expense of returning it...maybe I'll just throw it away!Very disappointed and especially in Melissa & Doug products not being cheap to begin with I expect better design and quality!"
1,poor choice for the money,"I have had this bag for about 3 months and use it lightly- I bring a 14.1"" laptop back and forth to work at most three times a week. Allready the seams for the computer compartment are tearing and the leather is showing quite a bit of wear, though it goes from my car to under my desk. The bottom of the bag is unstuctured, so those nice brass buttons you see do nothing to protect the bootom of the bag when you actually place a computer in it- it bootoms out, allowing the the leather to rest on the ground, what the buttons are there to avoid. All in all, cute bag, but not worth the money and the quality/ performance just are not there."
4,Nice Kit,I built this kit with my son. The pieces fit together nicely the results were very good for a kit that requires no paint and no glue.
3,Good Gift,I bought this as a gift for a 10 year old boy who likes to build model cars. He said that this was an average car. Not as technical as some.
5,Exactly what I ordered,"Book arrived quickly and was exactly what was described. Very pleased with this purchase. I enjoyed reading this book, and found it to be humorous and applicable to being a mom."
5,Classic,"This album is for those who want the essence of the 90's and true Hard Core Gangsta RAP! This album unfortunately got lost in the shuffle due to other album coming out during this time frame. You had Outkast's ""ATaliens, 5th Ward Boyz..Same titled album which was also a CLASSIC, along with EAST Coast's Method Man and the emergence of Jay Z and 2PACS ""Me Against tha World"". Plainly said it was a tough year to release a album. But, nonetheless this was well received down SOUTH. You could hardly walk around a corner and not have a car sitting at a ""RED LIGHT"" not bumping this. This album was particularly popular with local GANG Members during this time especially the Gangsta Disciples. This album even thought lost in the shuffle for those not indoctrinated into the urban ghettos would easily outplay any album from new artist today."
3,Always something new.,"Much like other extreme metal bands (Cradle of filth,Dimmu Borgir,Arcturus)Tot tried to progress to something new with each album.The jump from Velvet darkness to Aegis worked well and from Aegis to Musique they progressed even more.But was the progression worth it? Not really.Sure the album isnt Particularly great, The music is not as dark as it used to be,The lyrics are somewhat cheesy and Livs vocal style doesnt seem to fit like it used to.But its not all bad the album does have its own charms,if you can push the above aside it makes a great Electro/Goth album and at club level would probably fit in perfectly.If you are after gothic metal Try the first two albums but if you want something to dance to that still has goth aesthetics you might actually enjoy it. Eitherway id recommend it above trash ""gothic"" metal like Lacuna coil."
1,trying to be fair...but,"ToT has changed, it's true, some of it is downright amazing examples of european techno, but I know most people would rather have the original ToT back. If you already know you like some songs off this album, or you are just experimenting with industrial music, I would suggest ToTs 'Aegis', which is overall more consistently good. There are a couple songs on this album that I have to listen to now and then, just for the singer. The bonus track ""The New Man"" is strangely the best song on this album, but only because of the vocals, the music itself is uninspiring 3 second loops of palm-muted guitars and some off-pitch synth seemingly thrown in just to make the album sound somewhat interesting."
2,something went wrong,"what happened? it just all went so wrong. im sure theres people out there who might like this album, but hell, i sure prefer their other albums over this one. this one sounds more..how shall i say..club-ish?"
3,Hi-tech Theatre of Modern Times,"The medieval themes are gone, the gutural vocals were already gone, the archaic English is gone... Theatre Of Tragedy as we knew it is definitely gone. ""Musique"" is not a bad album, it reminds me of Rammstein and Kraftwerk. The songs are techno-pop oriented, but still feature some heavy guitar riffs as backgrounds... I think they should have done this album as a parallel project, cause the name ""Theatre of Tragedy"" has already a strong image of a once great doom metal band, and it doesn't fit here at all!!Try not to compare with other ToT things, cause that's IMPOSSIBLE, and give it a try, it's pretty interesting!!"
1,why do bands do this?,"Why do bands change their style, trying to gain popular recognition, when history has proven that IT DOESN'T WORK??? Why throw away all the talent they had to make this techno-dung? Anyone who thinks this is more creative and intelligent than their old albums should be shot for ignorance. VDTF and Aegis are still selling better than this. And Raymond can't sing. This is borderline hip-hop and hip-hop is stupid. Well fortunately Liv Kristine left them and is in a band where they'll let her explore the vast reaches of her vocal talents and not robo-talk like that... Rohonyi did with this load of pig ... BTW to the ... reviewer who said that this is a 'serious step forward,' using more synth & programming is a BAD thing. Only people who can't play their instruments overdo synthesizers and hip-hop ... beats."
2,Is this an A-ha tribute album???,"I am a new convert to the ""black metal"" (I use that term loosely after listening to this cd) genre and recently picked up this CD. I was expecting more of a symphonic experience like Tristania's ""Beyond the Veil."" I am disappointed with the premise that this album is listed in the black metal genre. It belongs somewhere else, preferrably electronica. However, I've heard that TOT's earlier work holds truer to the genre, so I'll probably pick up an earlier TOT album.If you like synth-based music with a Gothic twist, the album is palatable. I rated it two stars mainly for the disappointment of my own expectations, not necessarily for the album itself. I must now deal with the sadness of my own disappointment. Of course, it could have been worse. I could have actually picked up an A-ha cd...."
4,"Their atmosphere is still intact, for the most part...","If you're a fan of everything they have done until now, and listen primarily to that kind of music, you probably won't like this. Whatever their true intentions, they have modified their style quite a bit, taking things a bit less seriously in some parts. Much of it has become a blend of industrial with what they used to do, with clear Kraftwerk influences. ""City of Light"" and ""Retrospect"" come the closest to comparing with their previous efforts. I'd say you should pick this up if you don't mind giving something new a try, or if you already like this style of music to begin with. For what it's worth, I like it..."
1,Vomit!!,This is herendous!! What the f*** happened to T.O.T. By far the biggest sell out move ever experienced by these gothic ears. If you hate Goth and like pop and techno than this is for you. If not then avoid immediately and grab their earlier titles. When the band was at the forefront of their genre. I dont even like to admit its T.O.T. Its all just a bad dream!
2,Pick up one of their other albums instead,"Compared to their other work, this just doesn't make the cut. It's full of techno-space-pop tunes that don't hold true to the gothic metal/opera genre. Oh well.."
2,Definitely NOT the same band!,"Terrible! Once a superior death/goth-metal band, TOT is now nothing more than synthesized techno-pop! And what's with the guy's voice? Personally, I find the exagerated british accent a bit annoying; i repeat, the EXAGERATED british accent.The only reason I give this CD 2 stars is for the female vocals, which are still great, despite the noise in the background.Oh how the mighty have fallen....."
2,If pigs could fly and hell froze over...,"...then Theatre of Tragedy's ""Musique"" would be a good listen. But it's not. Not unless you like electronica and trance-club music. Why the hell would they go from making good, thoughtful metal music to this no-talent-required electronic sludge? They cut most of the guitar parts out and replaced them with programming. I guess if you like stuff like Switchblade Symphony, you might like this, but old fans stay away. Raymond ought to give it up; where did he come up with the notion that he could sing in the first place? And what kind of IDIOT would take a talented vocalist (Liv Kristine) and make her sing stupid pop lines with a dorky robotic voice? Well, at least she did the right thing and left and sounds lots better in Leaves' Eyes.If you're a longtime TOT fan, stay far, far away. If you're a Britney wanna-be with a small guitar fetish, you'll like it. If you respect talent, get the old albums."
2,To much Change,"Aegis was the turning point, you could tell that it was somewhat different than the other albums. Even though, the Aegis album is one of my favorites...they all are!! With the exception of Musique, I mean it is like another band and I really, really loved the old stuff because of the passion put into it. This album just didn't have that."
3,Goth techno...?,"Unlike some of the other reviews, I have to write this from the perspective of someone who hasn't heard all that much of TOT. This album wasn't as bad as many of the reviewers said, they were just comparing it to TOT's other recordings. Personally, I found myself captivated by the techno beats starting with the first song, but the vocals were weak and the lyrics dull and impassionate. The techno-sounding vocals, beat and rhythm get rather monotonous after about three songs, but 3 or 4 songs stand well on their own. I give this three stars because of tracks like ""Machine"" that make the disc worth buying, and Liv Kristine's chilling voice. However, don't expect a piece of art that lives up to ToT's reputation."
3,stay as an atmospheric goth-metal band;-),"This album is very different from TOT's previous albums.If you're a real TOT fan,you know that their previous albums had Liv Kristine's soprano vocals backed by a harsh male vocals.In ""Musique"",all those are gone.Even the double bass-drums and the guitar riffs are no longer present in this album."
4,Mesmerism and Melodrama,Dumas' 19th century melodrama makes a good film subject and a vehicle for Orson to play to the gallery. Recommended.
3,"I loved the comic book - but then which ""Phantom Fan"" wouldn't?","I grew up reading ""The Phantom"" so I have to be excused for my enthusiasm. Nevertheless a great read for any super hero fan :)"
3,Phantom as I remember,As state by another revier the first two stories are out of sequence which is a little off putting but the rest of the comic is great and enjoyed the art work
1,"Outdated, erroneous, and stigmatizing . . . terrible!","This recently-produced video titled ""Understanding Mental Illness"" contains information and classifications of mental illness that pre-date the DSM-III. One of the most glaring examples is its description/classification of schizophrenia as a ""Personality Disorder."" What's worse, really bad actors bulge their eyes and display stereotypical (and often violent or menacing) behaviors during poorly-produced vignettes. For example, a woman trembles with ""fear"" as a rubber spider is pulled across a blanket as she lies in bed. I've seen more realistic scenes (and better actors) in 1950s era 3-D movies! This video/DVD is far worse than any of the old 16mm health education films that I suffered through as a high school student. I would have rated this video/DVD as a ""Zero-Star"" if it was an available option."
2,Go buy one from K-mart,"I bought this iron on-line, my hairdresser used it on me and I loved the results. Previously, I'd bought a cheap one from Sally Beauty Supply for around $30, and was never able to achieve the same shiney, perfectly stick-straight look as the stylist. Silly me thought perhaps it was in the quality of the tool, so I went and spent about $150 on this iron. Actually, when I used this iron, my hair looked exactly the same as using the cheap iron.So, the problem is not the iron, it's my lack of technique. Obviously one can probably get the same salon type results with a cheaper iron if one is good at doing hair."
4,Love my grinder,"I've owned this model grinder for 5 years,with no problems.My favorite,every day coffee is a 50/50 blend of 8 O'Clock 100% columbian beans,and 8 O'Clock Dark roast beans,I mix 2 bags well,store in a large ziplock,and fill the hopper when necessary.Today,my son used some beans he received as a gift,[not flavored,just a dark roast]and for the first time,my grinder got clogged.Hubby cleaned it out,and all is well,nothing broken.For a home grinder,this is just the best,and good looking too.Do you know this model is discontinued? I panicked,and bought one of the 6 cinnamon gloss grinders amazon had left [my current model is empire red,and there are none left]And the model that is replacing this one,is 200$ or more,and ugly as sin.For the money,this grinder is a hard worker and good looking."
1,Can't handle coffee beans with oils,"I've been through 2 of these with the same result: if you ever start using a bean that has any oils for flavor it will kill the grinder. The replacement warranty is good, but in the end it still can't suffice with modern coffee beans. 1938 doesn't work in 2006."
1,gave this away,"I have sensitive skin and based on the other review decided to try this. This smells so horrible, just like vomit. I put it on once and never again, I gave it away because it smells that bad. I love body shop products but not this one."
3,Chiming in on the bad smell,"I think it's not the aloe but the sesame oil ingredient. It smells like food on my face, which I find off-putting, though I'm still trying to use it because I like the fact that it has a low (meaning, low in hazardous ingredients) rating at Environmental Working Group's Cosmetics Database.A commenter below suggested that removing the plastic lid prevents the smell. I'll see if that works although it doesn't fit with my perception of what causes the smell. But if something good comes out of it I'll try to remember to update this comment."
1,do not buy this stroller. it is extremely dangerous.,"#1 this stroller does not fit in any car#2 do fold it, you have to remove the seats#3 it is extremely dangerous. they have to stop selling it. the stearing mechanism broke at about a year. luckily my wife was a block away from the house and the neighboors had to help her bring the kids home. imagine being stranded far away!!!4. the turning radius is extremely wide. you have to move back and forth, left and right 2 or 3 times before you can make a turn"
1,Short life span-weight capacity limited,"Used this stroller for less than one year. I live in the North East so it was used only a few months last summer. Our problem is the front wheels are tilting inward and front wheels roll off. I purchased replacement wheels - all four cost over $115. It did not solve the problem. I have a 2 year old and 1 year old twins. I thought the stroller was a good investment but it was not. I am back searching for another stoller and I'll admit this stoller is a great concept but it is a Poor Design. My children's combined weight is probably less than 80lbs. With the cost of this stroller, it should last much longer. Peg Perego go back to the drawing board because once you have survived twins or lord bless, tripletts we do deserve much better than this product. The Peg Perego website provides for ""authorized repair shops"", the link does not work and if you read other reviews it has not worked for two years."
2,"ALBUM IZ OK....LACKS AGUILERA DUET ON ""NOBODY WANTS 2 BE LONLEY""!!!!","DA ALBUM IZ OK....DA ONLY SONG I LIKE ON DIS ALBUM IZ ""SHE BANGS"" & DA ""NOBODY WANTS 2 BE LONELY"" DOESN'T FEATURE CHRISTINA AGUILERA....LIKE IT ORIGINALLY DID ON DA MUSIC VIDEO.....DON'T BUY DIS ALBUM IF UR LOOKIN' 4 GR8 MUSIC....DA ONLY SONG DAT IZ GOOD ON DIS ALBUM IZ ""SHE BANGS""!!!! DA ""NOBODY WANTS 2 BE LONELY"" SUCKS WITHOUT CHRISTINA AGUILERA....I WOULD RATE DIS ALBUM 1/10!!!!"
3,good album but,I really enjoyed the album but I was very disappointed that the originale booklet with pictures and lyrics wasn't included in this special edition.
1,livin la vida broke-a,"or atleast would have been if not for the few dozen producers/song writers it took to create this mess.he had 2 semi ok songs on his first,shes all i ever had and cup of life.i say semi because theres no way it should of had that many people to make such simplistic songs.and that in itself reflects one level of telent.i heard him live(not sure if any lip sync machines were used)and his voice is incredibly weak.he avoided every difficult note he ripped so fearlessly on his cd and depended heavily on the orchestra/chior sections.i shouldnt knock him for his inability to write his own songs,i mean,who does nowadays?and his voice,however studio enhanced it is,isnt the worst to hit the musick scene.it just so obvious that he is a gimmick driven oddity.the male(?)britney spears.well,as you can see,his time is all but a thing of the past.GOOD RIDDANCE!"
2,Average,when Ricky Martin is doing dance music or uptempo stuff he sounds good but the soft Ballads do nothing for him but make him sound ready for Vegas.he is a catchy Artist who will continue but all the flash&hype are over.Saint Tropez works but Nobody wants to be lonely doesn't.She Bangs is Formula Driven.but I Give Him Credit for HAnging Around as long as he has.
1,"It Flopped, and for a Good Reason","Martin wowed audiences with his performance of ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" at the 1999 Grammys, and he quickly thereafter shot to stardom. But his career hit a thud with this shockingly dull disc. Lots of heart and energy, but no soul. This record flopped badly upon release, and it's easy to see why. Martin's novelty act has worn thin and is already yesterday's news."
1,ricky,I am a fan of Ricky but not this album. I prefer him singing spanish instead of English. The only good part about the album is the salsa sounds.
2,OverRated Ricky,"Ricky Martin is seemingly attempting to mature in his musical style. Unfortunately, is this process he has lost a lot of the charisma and excitement that his last album contained. The only admirable song from this album is ""She Bangs"", while the rest are boring and lack any infectious melodies from albums past. What a dissapointment."
1,Sound Loaded NO ME GUSTO EN LO ABSOLUTO!,"Este album tiene canciones ridiculas y muy feas en donde Ricky Martin hace todo el esfuerzo de tratar de igüalar su éxito de ""Livin' la vida loca"". Pero no lo va a lograr, porque este album en general no sirve. Su voz se le escucha fea, los ritmos de las canciones no es igual que sus canciones anteriores. Ademas, Ricky Martin no tiene voz, solo baila y lo promocionan mucho. Este album será total fracaso en su carrera."
3,"Ricky, Ricky, Ricky","Ricky is known for his tendancy to create one or two hits at a time and the rest of the cd is nothing. If Ricky were to put all his hits on a cd, I would be highly inclined to think it would be a classic. Ricky sells cds easily because, even though he only has one decent song [or two] per cd, the song is such a hit that consumers just need and crave it. I am a fan of very few of his songs, but I must say, the ones he hits the big time with,[she bangs, livin la vita loca, and my personal favorite, the cup of life,] are masterpieces. more effort would mean more masterpieces. Don't let out the duds Ricky, only the perfected ones shall shine!"
4,Umm-William Hung???,Somebody needs to check the dates on his CD before he reviews his CD- theCD came out in 2001- WAY before William's versoin of She Bangs-Having said that- I love this CD- it never gets old- I love the latin rhythms-
3,Music Fan,"This album has a couple of songs on it that I really like. I am not usually a big fan of latin music,though. To "" A Music Fan"" Ricky Martin DID record ""She Bangs"" and released this album more than three years before Hung sang it, and I have to say, Martin's version is QUITE preferable."
4,Time is Precious Time is slipping away....,"Time is Precious Time is slipping Away and the fans will be waiting all their Life...Ricky Martin with Sound Loaded disappoints after the hit tracks in Vuelve N Ricky Martin. Apart from Nobody Wants to be Lonely, She Bangs is a one powerful plus point to opt for Sound Loaded. Come to me is fine slow track to feel high for a while and his vocals are too original n soothing. Loaded is another Dance track to sway around which has a good pick rythm n sound. The Touch is a cool ballad and One night man has those beats n voice which spell unlike Ricky! Sound Loaded is a 'Cool Pick' if you ever a great Fan of Ricky Martin - Sure, then you can't afford to relax n stay cool without listening the three top fav numbers of mine - Nobody wants to be lonely, She Bangs and Come to me."
2,SOUND 'UN' LOADED,"Ricky Martin is back with his second english CD. The first single ""She Bangs"" which is no surprise sounds a lot like ""Livin La Vida Loca"",....and it shows as the single peaked at a dismal No.12 on the Billboard Charts Hot 100, and is quickly falling.The album though has sold 2+million copies is fading fast, could not even hold a bullet on the Album charts during the Christmas Season, and this is why: This album is the same as the first.""Nobody Wants To Be Lonely"" is a weaker version of ""She Is All I Ever Had"", to fill up the CD they have spanish versions of ""She Bangs"", the album just fades from one song to the next with no real stand out potential hits....The CD is not awful it is just his previous album watered down."
1,it's pretty trashy!,"I feel violated listening to this cd. The songs are somewhat catchy, but it's too much effort on his part to just put something out there. The last song is decent...but it's a pretty trashy cd sorry Ricky. He konws how much I admire him, but waht has he done to himself?"
4,Hits-A-Plenty,"Okay, so female interest in Ricky's bonbon lasted one album worldwide, but this album really deserved more credit than it got in commercial terms. The formaula's the same, but hey it works & Ricky sounds like he enjoys the songs he's performing. She Bangs is really a Gloria Estefan song gone slightly wrong - horrendous video, but catchy. Title track is amazing & could easily be used in some American Movie car-chase. It raises my spirits & goes the whole Latin-Amercian hoopla. The searing ballad Nobody Wants To Be Lonely works better without Miss Diva Aguilera, but in no way parodies Private Emotion from the previous album. Nevertheless, a solid work by Mr Martin, only to be appreciated by much less than last time round. Shame, 'cos he still does get your bon-bon shakin occasionally. Maybe the drastic hairdo on the album cover put people off?? Don't blame them, hoho"
1,WARNING!,"The bonus track on this CD is not really a bonus, it's on the regular version of Sound Loaded. The version of Nobody Wants To Be Lonely does not feature Christina Aguilera. It's only Ricky. So unless you're buying it for the extra content in the cardboard box, which I guess is worth it if you're a huge Ricky fan, don't buy it!"
4,"Nothing spectacular, but fun all the same","I actually bought this CD just to get the free promotional single but have ended up listening a lot! The fast songs are the best part of the album. St.Tropez is a great song, Loaded is one of those songs where when you hear it you have to dance, If You Ever Saw Her and Amor are fun songs to sing along to. The only major flaw with this CD is that Ricky doesn't have a great voice. While this doesn't matter on the action packed fast songs, it sounds very weak on the slow songs. If you like Latin flavored pop from artists such as Christina, Enrique and Jennifer, then definately pick up this CD."
4,totally loaded,"I'm not a huge fan of Rick Martin and I didn't really like his debut, but his follow-up is really good. Lots of grooves to keep you shakin' and the 3 ballads are really cool too. Each song is loaded with different sounds and Ricky seems more relaxed and natural when singing. He still has a little trouble with the ballads but he still fairs well. Highlights include: ""she bangs"", ""saint tropez"", ""nobody wants to be lonely"", ""the touch"", ""are you in if for love"" and ""if you ever saw her."" Good job Ricky."
3,Definitivamente mejor que el anterior...,"This album is better than the other one , much better. Its more latin although there is no that much spanish in it. 'Saint Tropez' sounds like an intro to a Luis Miguel concert, just the introduction. 'Jezabel' has some tango to it. 'Are you in it for love' has a mexican-spanish style.. 'One night man' its very arabic, (sounds like Disney's Aladin at first) but its a nice comercial song.. A great song on this album is 'Cambia la piel' beautiful lyric, beautiful sound fusion. A nice balad is 'nobody wants to be lonely'. If you like Ricky Martin its a must have. If you didn't like the livin la vida loca one you can give this one a chance its somewhat different; not that anglo ,except for the language; but it has 4 songs completely in spanish... Its a good CD but it doesnt have the force and feeling of 'A medio vivir' and 'Vuelve' ..."
2,Not one of Ricky's best work,"Okay, I don't understand why this CD is getting such good reviews. It has no memborable songs, none that jump out when you hear them (except maybe 1 and 4). I borrowed it from my cousin and played the whole CD when I realized it was over and I couldn't remember any of the songs. Totally dissapointing compared to his self-titled CD. I guess because his other CD was so popular he thought he could slack on this one. ..."
3,Half satisfied..,"This CD was not totally bad. She Bangs is the strongest song on this album, I would say. Great dance song! Nobody Wants To Be Lonely is really good with Ricky by himself, but I think it's even better when he joins Christina Aguilera on it, so try to find that version of it, I think it's more enjoyable. St. Tropez is another awesome dance track on this. The thing that bothers me about this album was all the songs done in spanish. I love listening to songs that are sung in a different language, but when Ricky includes them on his album, they get boring fast..after just a listen or two and you find yourself skipping them. His debut has more to offer than his second, but not too bad of an effort here."
2,"Man, enough!","The audio sucks!!! The ""show"" is the only thing that saves this. If I could tell what he/she is singing I might be able to get more into this but...man, enough of crappy audio on these DVDs!"
4,Good dictionary for beginning German speakers.,"This English/German, German/English dictionary is the perfect aid for the beginning German speaker. It has pronounciation guides tailored for English speakers, sample sentences in English and German, plus gender, plurals, etc. for each word.Because of the size of each entry, there is not the large number of words that other bilingual dictionaries contain, so it will be less useful for the advanced German speaker.Overall, an excellent introduction to German."
3,Unexpectedly Norwegian,"When I bought this CD, I had no idea that there were two Peer Gynt Suites. All I knew was that the part about ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" was part of a longer story, but exactly how that worked was still a mystery.I got pretty close to finding out what's what. Peer Gynt, like Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"", has a narration, which is included in this excellent performance. In Norwegian. The narration is translated in the album notes, but fumbling around with them kind of defeats the purpose of listening to the CD in the first place.If you don't mind that part, this is a perfectly good album."
4,Fforde Ddoes Iit Aagain,"At first, I was disappointed that Jasper Fforde chose not to continue the Thursday Next series in his newest release, but I have thoroughly enjoyed DI Jack Spratt's adventures in ""The Big Over Easy."" Though the universe in this book is not as expansive as in the Thursday Next books, my enjoyment of it never felt limited. Some of the jokes can literally whizz right by you. At one point Spratt and his sidekick DS Mary Mary discuss how the other characters don't realize that they're in nursey rhymes, not realizing they are too! And there's a bit with a Mrs. Hubbard, her dogs, and her cupboard that gave me a good laugh.If you can accept the premise of this book, then just dive in and enjoy this clever, funny novel."
5,Stupendously Awesome,"I was blown away by the world that Fforde managed to create, a truly believable world, in which you begin to think is extreme fantasy but then you hear about eBay, Nokia, and the Internet. It is truly a spectacular world, so much like ours, yet entirely different and exciting. I cannot believe I haven't heard more about it before. Definitely in the top five of my favorite books of all time."
3,"I like Jasper Fforde, but not this book.","I was greatly looking forward to the release of another Fforde book, but was disappointed in this one. It definately had the same creativity and tounge-in-cheek humor of Jasper's Thursday Next novels, but I really missed learning more about Thursday's world, and her adventures within classical novels. I'm about as well versed-on verse as anyone, being an elementary music teacher by trade, but it seemed there were still many references I didn't quite get. And it didn't renew my interest in Mother Goose the way the Thursday Next series made me want to go read Jane Eyre and the other novels Fforde delved into. I guess I want more time-travelling, book hoping, truly unique adventure, and less fairly standard crime mystery in a oddly fitting nursery tale world."
3,I'll take Nursery Rhymes for $100...,"Fforde just makes you think too much. There is so much nursery rhyme tie-in that it makes your head spin. It's too much to really concentrate on the story! You spend all of the time piecing together the little bits of clues and subtle allusions to the rhymes themselves, and the story gets a bit lost in the shuffle. It did make me want to look up a lot of information on nursery rhymes, but it was a hard book to follow with all the distractions.If you get a kick out of those sorts of tie-ins and know a great deal about nursery rhymes, this is probably one of the best books you'll read. The parts I did get were masterfully done. And Fforde has a great writing style, which is normally very engaging. But if you're more like me, and are going to spend the whole book almost getting it but feeling like you're missing something you should know, I'd give this one a miss. His Thursday Next books are far more enjoyable!"
1,So Disappointed....,"This book in no way stands up to the Thursday Next series. I adore Mr. Fforde's playfulness but I had to work to finish this book. The plot, characterizations and setting just don't gel here. If you can take this book as a series of one-liners, you will enjoy it. But don't expect the sophistication you have come to enjoy with the Thursday Next world, it just isn't delivered here."
2,Pythonesque? I think not.,"I fell for the reviews that thought this book was hilarious and I was so excited about it that I recommended to my book club BEFORE I READ IT- big mistake. I am enjoying this book so little that it is an effort to pick it up and read it. If it were not for my book club, I would have discarded it long ago. It is not a bad book, in fact, it is kind of cute, and may be considered humorous by a person who is maybe age 10? I love Monty Python and, I swear, this isn't even close."
4,So Much Fun!!,"This series is awesome. This first book is imaginative and funny, allowing Fforde to build a world that a reader really does not want to leave."
4,Fractured fairy tale with a fractured victim,"I absolutely love the premise of a Nursery Crime Division comprised of detectives to investigate the crimes in Nursery Rhymes. Jasper Fforde has a great idea with this novel, The Big Over Easy and he executes it well. Did Humpty Dumpty fall or was he pushed? Detective Jack Spratt and Sergeant Mary Mary are on the case!This was a humorous and entertaining read. I enjoyed picking out all the characters from various nursery rhymes. I think my favorites were Georio Porgia as an organized crime leader and Solomon Grundy as an enterprising mogul. It was also fun to see Wee Willie Winkie. I enjoyed the premise, the humor, and the characters in this novel. It is full of wit and fun. I'd like to read the next installment."
3,A Good Read - but Jack Spratt is no Thursday Next,"Anyone who read the Thursday Next books will be disappointed in this one. It's a good read - and if you haven't read Ffords previous books you'll enjoy it. But it's lacking the quirky inventiveness of the Next books. Jack has been with the Nursery Crime Division of the Reading Police for 20+ years, but is unfamiliar with some of the well-known rhymes (Jack and the Beanstalk for instance).This a is a basic police procedure book - with the twist that the investigation is of a nursery crime (the murder of Humpty Dumpty).This is not a ""I read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down"" book. I read the 4 Thursday Next books in less than a week - this one took me almost a week to read."
4,Fun music; good recording,"I was introduced to Kabalevsky in my youth orchestra when we performed the Overture to Colas Breugnon. The overture is incredibly fast-paced, exciting, and fun to play, so I went on a search for more Kabalevsky music. I was disappointed to find that he is, in my opinion, an under-rated composer. It isn't easy to find very many recordings of his works.I stumbled across this CD featuring the Moscow Symphony, which features some great pieces. ""The Comedians"" has the energetic quality and the occasional bizarre chord progression that makes the Colas Breugnon suite (also on this recording) so much fun. And it is always interesting to hear yet another musical interpretation of ""Romeo and Juliet.""I had never heard a recording by the Moscow Symphony, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of that group. The orchestra does a good job with some incredibly difficult music. I highly recommend this recording to both long-time Kabalevsky fans and new admirers."
5,Exelent,"I'm happy with this product, I think that in the future I will buy the ink in this place again."
3,Low Price... Low Quality,"The cartridge didn't dispense the ink properly, but it was better than none at all. I did receive what I was expecting for the very low price. Would not recommend to anyone who needs superior quality color printing."
1,dry,"It arrived on time, popped into my printer just like always and produced no ink. It was dry. Yes, I did remove the tape that keeps it from drying out, just like I always do."
1,HP23 Multicolor Cartridge,I have been using this cartridge for about one month and the BLUE ink is out. This is very discouraging. I may print 4-5 pages per day most of which are B&W.;Richard
3,HP 23 Inkjet Cartridge,The cartridge works fine so far but the only reason why I rate it so low is because on the side of the package it showed a date that showed that it was about 3 years old instead of new so I am not sure if I would buy from them again.
1,Not A Brand New Cartridge,"This cartridge description made it sound like it was new, and when it came, it did not come in the packaging as it looks like in the picture, which is deceiving. That is new packaging in the picture. It only came in the inside carton pack, and it had a different looking sticker on the cartridge itself, than a brand new HP one has. When I tried it out, there was no blue color at all! It was a complete waste. I sent it back. I can't afford to waste $35 on a piece of junk. Don't buy."
3,Low ink,"These don't seem to last very long. I have been a HP fan for years, but I must say they missed the boat on ink cartridges. Actually I would recommend the Kodak 5300 All In One printer as this ink doesn't do pictures justice."
2,Color Inkjet is Weird,"Recently installed this cartridge and it is not printing red correctly. All of the colors are ""off'. Disappointed, I am wondering what is wrong with this cartridge."
3,"Quality output, but wish there were more ink in there!","In my HP 880c printer, this cartridge generates beautiful results. On cheap copier paper, even photos print crisply and richly. However, I can't believe how often I have to replace this cartridge. I mostly print text documents with incidental color -- hyperlinks and occasional graphics -- and I replace the color cartridge about as often as I replace the black cartridge."
3,color inkjet,"Well it came in good order and looks like it will work ok. but I have not tried it out as yet. It did take longer than I was hoping for, in the mail to arrive here. I really wanted both types of inks from the same company too, that would have been better. The black ink came much faster from inksmile in the mail, than the colored ink did.Thanks."
1,"GWTECHPARTS: wrong ink, and very old anyway","I ordered an HP23 inkjet cartridge, and received an HP49 cartridge, so it didn't fit in my printer. The ink also expired in 2007, and so it probably was dried up anyway. I now see that lots of people have been complaining about receiving dried up ink cartridges, so perhaps buying off of Amazon isn't a good idea for ink. I guess that it is why it is so much cheaper than from Staples, et al."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!,"I am totally angry and disgusted with the cartridge which was sent to me. They indicated that the cartridge would work with my printer at the outset on the site. I ordered the cartridge in good faith and spent $28.97 for it and when it arrived, it printed only in red tones. I looked at the box and saw that they had put a label over the expiration date and I removed it with water and saw that the expiration year was either 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008 or 2009 since the last digit was not readable. This is 2012, as you know and even the 2009 would be 3 years outdated.I am really disappointed that these shoddy companies are allowed to do business with Amazon and Amazon buyers should not be bamboozled and hoodwinked this way. Something has got to be done."
1,No good,"The cartridge arrived promptly, but had no red ink. I did not check the expiration date, but the red was either dried up or it never was filled. Money was refunded, but the whole reason I pay the full retail price is to avoid this kind of issue. I have ordered another-the local stores don't stock this type of cartridge anymore. Wish me luck.I have used this type of ink cartridge for 10+ yrs and they have worked well, last a reasonable length of time, always run out of yellow first."
3,Missing color,"Quick delievery of HP 23 cart. Ok, the cart I had in there was missing one color.I looked all over to buy a new cart. No luck. Tried this, it was missing one color and the box was taped up...looked used... With this cart, I have a different color missing now. I took this cart and refilled with a ink refill kit. Still nothing.(not a printer problem)I believe once the ink has dried up in the head, you are done. I might try and flush with some alchohol,can't hurt the car, then refill again. I bought a new hp printer with the 5 carts, Junk...same old ink problems....<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO MORE HP>>>>>>>>>"
1,"SO CALLED ""HP 23""","QUAILITY OF THESE ITEMS, AS I ORDERED TWO WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE. WAS NOT ABLE TO USE. COLOR WAS OF TERRIABLE QUALITY."
1,ink cartridge,ink cartridge was 4 years out of date. Age of the ink cartridge was not available when it was ordered. More detailed description would have been an honest presentation
4,so far so good,I bought it because the price was right. I just put it into my printer three days ago and haven't printed color yet so I have to be truthful and say I didn't use it yet!
5,Great Product,"This is a must for anyone who turns screws. Fast and light weight.Don't expect to use this tool to screw together a deck, but it is great for electrical trim work."
2,Short Life Span,"I thought I was upgrading from the Milwaukee 2.5 volt power screwdriver. This one has the noisy clutch, but I have never had any trouble with this style.The auto shut off of the Panasonic is a electric switch that turns the tool off. Mine lasted about 4 months, returned for service, lasted another 2 weeks. The clutch was stoping power to the motor.. I like the extra power, but will stick to the Milwaukee for reliability."
5,AWESOME,"I used a plug-in type texture hopper for a house I gutted and remodeled, and I thought it was ok. Oh my, was I wrong. This sprayer is truly pro-grade. It has a large hopper that holds plenty of mud for spraying with minimal refilling needed. Cleans easily and the trigger assembly is very solid feeling. This cut my texturing time by over half versus the plug-in yellow one I used prior to this one. The pattern is more consistent and can easily be adjusted with the controls on the handle, and by changing the tip so there are many possibilities. I also haven't run into the gunking up problem that my other one has after being used for a little while."
3,BEST OF EUROPE: FRANCE {BLU-RAY},"I got this back in the summer of 2012 & haven't watched it since, but I do remember that the content was ok,but not the blu-ray quality. I don't get to travel & I do like to watch travel shows on parts of the world I'll probably never get to. If you are going to France any time soon this would be ok to watch to get an idea of what to expect. I bought the blu-ray hoping that I would feel like I was right there. Not the case. I was rather disappointed with the quality & that could be why I haven't re-watched it. The price was right but not the quality."
2,no more rudy,please no more rudy maxa. I would not have bought this disc if I was aware that this was a guided tour. I only want to see the places of interest. Not a review of the wine and cheeses.
3,Okay...,"I bought this video in order to get inspired for a vacation to France. The information about each region was somewhat interesting. The gentlemen in the video is knowledgeable and the video is well put together. I doubt that I will re-watch it. It was helpful in deciding which areas to visit on the upcoming trip, that's about it."
2,Best of Europe DVD,Very short and not worth the money by any means. I would not recommend this or any other CDs by this person or company unless you have more money than brains.
2,Could have been MUCH better,"What should have been a nice history of the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists annual awards turns out being a mish-mash of art. Reproduction quality is all across the board and ranges from being very good to simply awful (the Frazettas, some of Hickman's, Brad Foster's, some of Jim Gurney's, etc. are printed so badly that it would have been best to not include them at all). Troubling too are the numeous tiny reproductions: if the book is supposed to celebrate the art, why make some the size of postage stamps? There definitely are some very good pieces nicely reproduced (Whelan, Donato, Palencar, etc.), but most are already available in other books. At the fairly hefty cover price I was expecting much more than what the editors and publisher delivered."
1,Don't Buy This Edition!,"This is a great book and every food gardener should have a copy in their library. As a Master Gardener, this book has been extremely useful in helping the public with their vegetable and fruit gardening questions, it covers everything. But, this edition is a very bad copy of the original 1977 hard cover edition. It was poorly scanned, the color photographs are dark, mottled shadows, totally useless. There are still new editions of the original available here on Amazon and many good used editions. Save your money and get the original!"
4,Not just for Kids,"My 12 year old granddaughter introduced me to this atlas. She said it was part of her school work. The detail information and numerous maps were outstanding. I bought one for myself. Some evenings I simply sit with the atlas and, for an hour or so, become totally involved with its contents. It is not just for kids.Just look inside the book here at Amazon and you will see how informative this 132 page atlas really is."
2,merriam-webster's student atlas,"This atlas is very limited in maps of the world. It is helpful for miscellaneous information but not as an atlas, i.e. a book of world maps."
4,Just what the teacher requested,"When I ordered this for my daughter I wasn't sure if it would be what she needed, but now that she has had to use it several times, I know it is right. It is just the right size as to not weigh down her backpack too."
3,"Not quite a ""world"" atlas","I found this Atlas under the title of ""world atlas"" at Amazon.com. I see Europe has a large number of cities mentioned as does Africa, Canada and of course the USA (guess this is for US students) but perhaps the folks who published this ""atlas"" don't consider a large continent like Australia to be important and where is the individual maps of countries like New Zealand, Fiji and other Pacific countries. No wonder most Americans don't seem to have a clue where I'm from when I tell them New Zealand. But it does have some interesting points like geography type maps (provided what you want to see is USA (which has way more pages than other countries. If you were in New Zealand or Australia you would get an Atlas that shows a detailed map of ""every"" country in the world including geographical features(I guess that's why Kiwi's and Aussie students are ""ahead"" of U.S. students in education...certainly in their knowledge of the world and location of where other countries are)."
1,This CD Should Have Remained ABOARD The Titanic... (Un-Discovered),"When a 'fad', like the movie ""Titanic"", takes off everyone wants to be onboard; this CD should have been left onboard - the Titanic, that is. Being fully aware of the actual scores played by White Star Line, I can only presume the scores used in this compilation were generated by someone who failed Arranging 101; they are puerile at best - AND the piano is hideously out-of-tune! Quite frankly, should this CD ever be reissued, purchasers should be PAID to listen to this crap. As a musician, I would ashamed to have my name associated with this CD. If this represents the music played on deck while the great ship sank, I understand why 3rd Class Passengers remained below..."
1,"wrong decription, this is not taffeta","The product description says ""TAFFETA"" and when I received the cape (1 day later than the tracking promised) the cape was VINYL.It is thicker than my rain coat. I would have dealt with it if the fabric were not taffeta, but a flowing material, but it is very rubbery and stiff and has creases from folding that I cannot iron out since I can't iron vinyl. Also, the red and the black colors are not vibrant or bold (as the picture indicates) at all because of the shininess of the vinyl. This item would be great for anyone that wants to be Dracula in the rain, but not for me. I wish somewhere in the description or picture I could see how rubbery and stiff the cape actually was."
5,"If it's King, it's gotta be good","Just paint me stupid. When I found this title in a Stephen King search, it was originally just listed as NIGHT JOURNEY #5. *duh* I failed to put 2 and 2 together and thought this was an early release of King's that wasn't yet in my collection. Luckily amazon has updated the listing to indicate that it is #5 in the GREEN MILE series. The description also states that this is of unknown binding. The one I ordered is in hard cover which is actually not that bad considering that I only have the paperback series. Order only if you are a diehard King fan who has to have everything in hard cover. I have to rate it a 5 because, hey, it's King and it's part of the GREEN MILE series which is an incredible body of writing."
3,Terror? Where?,"This book isn't scary; it isn't even gripping. The serial thriller turns into a murder mystery and revelations are made, but by now I've been so bored by the previous volumes, it doesn't even affect me. And if Paul Edgecombe urinates one more time, I shall scream."
4,The End of the Affair,"No-one is going to live or die by Kalinnikov. He is a one-hit wonder - but what a wonder it is: the Andante Commodamente of his First Symphony.If you have ever been enfiladed by Cupid - wham, bam thank you Ma'am - only for the Son of Venus to extract his arrowheads unceremoniously, this music is for you. Oh, how it stings! The transience of all such unions is glorified in Kalinnikov's unending pizzicato. Listen - with care - to this Catulline utterance if you want to rake over the ashes in search of old cinders.The Naxos forces here are persuasive advocates of this minor composer. Isaac Levitan's last (and unfinished) painting graces the cover. How apt it is: of meridians."
4,More Than Worth the Money,"It's entirely possible that the Jarvi performance is better, but for the money, you can't get much better than this. The sound quality is fairly good-- perhaps what you might get if you transferred a high-quality recording onto CD. The National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine certainly played well, and was probably the best choice for Kalinnikov's symphonies.Kalinnikov's symphonies are full of Russian sounds, as much as those of any Russian composer I can think of. The scherzo in the first symphony in particular is reminiscent of a Russian peasant dance. Kalinnikov may not be the best Russian composer, but this is still a darn good CD."
1,Battery,"I am sure that the product is great, if I would have gotten what I ordered. They sent me the up grade because they were out of the one that I ordered. Now I can not charge it, in my existing charger. I must either send it back or buy a new charger. Not good.Thank youReynold J Schultz JR."
2,The Doyle Substitution Debacle,"Mayhap we all have an apocryphal Sherlock Holmes tale simmering somewhere in our brains. Judging by the quality of writing and performance, this story would have best served Arthur Conan Doyle's legacy by remaining on the back burner."
4,"Charming music, well played","The works on this disc might not counted among Martinu's greatest works, but they are hugely enjoyable and brimful of infectious joy. The Promenades dating from 1939,are delightfully gregarious and chatty, yet sleekly elegant, neo-classical pieces, and the Trio for flute, violin and piano are written in much the same manner, tinges of folk-music-inspired classicism mixed with Les Six and a touch of Ravel and Prokofiev. The trio for flute, cello and piano is a slightly more serious work, with a finely lyrical Adagio.The performances are very fine, full of life and vigor, and the recorded sound is good as well. Some have complained that the programme is a little too unvaried for the disc to be listened to at one sitting, but personally I found the music captivating - the textures are sufficiently (though subtly) varied to sustain interest throughout. Recommended."
4,Enchantment . . .Golden Classics,I don't understand . . . THE Greatest balladon the entire album has been omitted. I had to buy a separaterecording of WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE / JOURNEY I KNOW thatit's on the original Vinyl . . .
5,Great for the price,"Great knobs, the price is fair, fast delivery. Bought the cabinet pulls at Lowes but the matching knob is a bit too small, so I ordered this on Amazon. The color is slightly different but not noticeable. This knob has a more blueish/blackish tone in it than the one at Lowe's. Ordered it on Tuesday night and received on Saturday."
2,Goes up and down and not much else,"Understand that this is not a 4 channel RC helicopter, but an inexpensive device with which to become familiar with the hobby. It promptly provides one with an understanding of how tricky helicopter flight really is, whether in hobby or in reality. This is one of the more stable versions of RC electric helicopters, and can be made to hover well, but if you think you can steer this thing around the room and drive circles around furniture . . . forget it. You need far more channels and controls to do that, and this barely allows movement because all steering and movement left/right and forward/back is via the tail rotor, which has VERY little power. Fun for 10 min, then you're done."
1,Did not fly!,"Purchased this thing after reading several positive reviews.The one I got did not work at all, it was uncontrollable. At first I thought it was for lack of skill, but then several friends who had skill with this kind of thing tried it and could not fly it either.Several people did complain that the 27MZ channel models were junk and mine was precisely a 27MZ. So who knows, in view of the many positive reviews I hesitate to crucify this product as a whole but what I got was a useless piece of junk. What a waste of time!"
3,Doesn't go forward,"This toy is very small and very impressive in how it's able to hover; however, the forward motion is way too slow, even if you put extra weight on the front, it either wont fly at all, or still won't go forward."
3,"Fun, but fragile.","The toy is fun to play with even for an adult. Pretty hard to control though, most probably you'll brake it while learning. My upper rotor got screwed during the very first launch. I managed to fix it and played with the toy for 2 more days, being more cautious, but finally the balancer broke off, it doesn't look to be fixable this time."
2,Not very good!,I saw this thing fly in a TV commercial and then took the bait. I could not get this thing to fly like the video showed. I'm betting they edited out all the times it crashed and broke and had to be repaired. The add for these things is just too good to be true. Buyer beware!!!
2,Fine while it lasted,"This was fun while it lasted. Recieved as a gift, however it's flimsy construction didn't last. One bad landing and it broke."
2,Go to Radio Shack instead,"I purchased two of the AlienFly RC helicopters on the assumption that since they were a clone of the Micro Mosquito they would function similarly. They do not. The AlienFly seems to suffer from an inherent instability that eventually causes it to entere into a rotor oscillation mode. The rotor oscillation causes it to enter into tighter and tighter spirals until it finally crashes. This mode happens even when the helicopter is just hovering. There doesn't seem to be any way to correct this.There is obviously no quality control on these helicopters (one of the two has a main motor ""stuttering"" problem and the other's tail motor doesn't stop when the controller is in the zero position). Do yourself a favor and stay away from this helicopter. The Micro Mosquito (Radio Shack) costs three time as much, but it works perfectly (I've purchased several and all worked perfectly) and comes with the charge base station (sold seperately for the AlienFly)."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,Simply put....Piece of junk. Don't waste your money. Mine was defective from the start. It couldn't fly forward and the controller worked intermittently then finally quit working after 2 days. Spend a few dollars more for a fully functional helicopter or go to radio shack and get the real thing. You will be much happier. Interesting conversional piece but nothing more unless you are lucky enough to receive a good working one.
1,peice of garbage,when i first bought this product i loved it then i started having problems the charging jack wasnt working it woudnt hold a charge then it finally cracked in half the propellars boke im in the midst of returing it hoping to get an exchange i wish i had purchased the real one i strongly recomend buying the real its a little more money but at least it probably works.
2,Flying up and down is ok but...,It cannot turn left or right. Hovering is ok for a while so don't waste your money.
4,Precision,"This is a pretty cool little device. It seems more solid, powerful, and precise than some of the other palm-sized helis. It's very stable, but does require you to fiddle with the trim frequently while it's running to keep it pointed in one direction. It's so stable that forward and reward motion is all but removed - it only moves forward at about a foot every 5-6 seconds, but, unlike some of the other small helis, actually goes where you want it to all the time.I was a bit disappointed when I first fired it up as it's really slow & sometimes the chaos of the other mico helis is fun. That said, the mosquito has grown on me - I can always put it where I want it, the battery lasts a long time on each charge, and it's cool to be able to go forward and backward without adding weights to the thing."
4,After 5 RS brand Mosqutios with burnt motors had to try this one,"Well it has been my fist full day playing with this one so far. Started off with a scare as the tail rotor did not want to seem to move, one thing that is different from the RS brand, tail rotor will only move when main rotors are spinning. After the tail rotor started working controls were just about the same as the RS brand, hoverver i could get this one to litterly FLY across the room in the forward direction (try that with the other one out there), great fun trying to control that speed. It does take some practice to get this speed out of it but if you accelerate slowly you will have an easier time keeping it straight. Flight times have reached 10 minutes, recharged in half an hour. Couple of crashes and no sighns of damage. Hopefuly motors will hold up but so far great piece of fun."
5,AlienFly Mosquito review,Very pleased with this little flying mosquito. It is very stable but forward / backward movements are slow.
5,scud is amazing,"I first read the SCUD books in high school. They are fantastical adventures, packed with action, sci-fi, fantasy, cyber stuff, wild west allusions and lots of blood and robots and monsters! This is probably one of the coolest comic series I've ever found. Too bad they're out of print. I highly recommend getting your hands on the the three trade paperbacks of the first 15 comics. They're all worth reading. I used to have them all, sadly, no more."
1,Misleading: Ridiculously Expensive!!!,"Be aware!!! I know this costs between $2-$3 at local Asian stores, but it says ""4 Packs"", so I thought I would get 4 of them, which sounded a better deal. Big mistake! It was just a one pack which includes 4 little pouches inside. Very misleading. This little thing cost $7.99??? Give me a break! This is a total rip off!!!"
1,Don't be suckered - even one star is too many,"If you're looking for the 2003 version starring Ed O'Neill, don't be suckered into buying this product, because you'll be very disappointed!"
2,10x25 binoculars,"these are cheap binoculars. for the price, i wasn't expecting much. that's what i got, not much. i was hoping the eye correction would work and you can focus both sides equally, but the left eye piece was off and couldn't be spun enough to work with the right eye. so, both eyes aren't in focus together. not bad, for the price, but i was hoping to have them work a bit better."
5,Street Corner Symphony,Incredible! Like a vacation back to my childhood. I Spent years hoping that this album would make it to CD.
5,Wonderful Acappella!,What beautiful soulful music. Recommend it to anyone looking for a great acapella group.
2,Liszt - a freak during his lifetime,"Too catholic for me, plus Liszt ruined my hand causing me to have to drop out of music school. The playing on these CDs is somewhat pedestrian, and I'm not sure why I bought them, if you want to know the truth."
3,Stirling Engine Design Manual,This book is a copy of a report directed to NASA and the D.O.E. from the early eighties. 70% of its content is reference and dated software text. I don't consider it a waste of money but would not recommend buying it without having first thumbed through it. That said the first 130 pages do deliver!
3,"Good overview, but out-dated.","A good overview of several design processes for Stirling Engines. However, some of the data and technology (computer programs) is out-dated."
3,lot of power but,"I received this router,and imediately took it out of the box to try it.The first thing that struck me was the poor machining & fit.It was comparable to tools from China.There was missing parts& wrenches,the plastic case is the worst I ever saw.I am a an experienced woodworker with a background in marine engineering,but I can,t get this thing in the case the way it is manufactured.On a positive note the router does have a lot of power,and you had better have a lot of power to overcome the compression springs on the plunge base.I was surprised to see such poor quality on a Frued tool.I,m waiting to hear from Freud for the missing acc.,but I,m thinking of returning it.I hate to keep a tool that I might regret."
3,MANUAL FOR ROUTER,"I read the other reviews praising or kicking this product. I just got it today and have not used it yet. The instructionmanual is a joke!!! If I did not have a mechanical mind, I wouldhave returned it. There are no instructions to do anything onthis router. I was able to figure out what was needed to change bases etc. It looks like it will do the job I wanted if for, theprice was ok. The edge guide adjust plate did not fit but I think I can fix that. The overall package was not what I expectedfrom Freud. I wish it had come with a ""Porter/Cable"" guide adpter."
1,Piece of junk.,Never got a chance to turn this tool on. The plunge base was skewed diagonally at least 5 degrees and the fixed laminate trimming base was tilted at least 10 degrees. I'm no machinist so I'm incapable of truing this tool. I've never had this kind of problem before and am sending it back. I don't have time to screw around with it. Too bad because I liked the moderate size and relatively powerful motor but I bought this for fine template work and I was extremely disappointed.
4,I Felt A Need To Have a Good English Translation of the Qur'an...,"... and research showed this particular English translation arguably to be the ""best"". It's a hard read; but instead of ""hearing"" what it ""says"", best to check it out first-hand. Certainly any translation of a document into English may not give the reader a ""feel"" for the original, but if it is true to the original language, at least one may learn what it says."
5,Sparky Fights Back has given us hope,I and my wife would recommend this book to any pet owner facing a cancer diagnosis of their dog. It is helpful to read the words of others who have traveled the same road. Each case is unique but all require a trusting but questioning approach. Only you as an owner can adopt the course of treatment that you are most confident of and you believe is most viable for your dog. Appreciating each day of good health and treasuring those moments when the harder times come is an important lesson. Reading this book will help with that thought process.
4,Quirky and heartfelt,"This has to be one of the more eclectic assemblages of essays out there. The first couple essays didn't really grab me, too much overview of clinical studies, but the scope of the rest kept me going. Topics range from infertility to Snow White to Laura Ingalls Wilder. Authors show up occasionally to add their two cents which keeps things casual, between friends."

2,koss pp257 not all it's talked up to be,I saw the koss PP257 in the picture and then saw the price and thought not bad. I went ahead and bought it but when i took it out for a run it didn't give me what i expected. I live on the north shore of long island and experienced a lot of static and fading in and out of the stations. I've used other products like the sony ones and didn't experience any of the fading in and out. What really attracted me to the item was its price. I do recomend this product if you exercize at home but if you run in the out doors spend the extra money and get yourself another product.
1,Koss PP257 - poor reception!,"I had trouble with this product, it simply does not receive most radio stations clearly. Within the Capitol Hill and University districts of Seattle, the only station that tuned-in well was KUOW (public radio). That's fine to feed my NPR addiction, but even the more powerful commercial stations didn't tune-in clearly. A major bummer."
1,Poor Performance,"Although this product had a 3.5 to 4 star rating when I bought it, I do not agree. I found the reception to be poor and inconsistent and the quality to be lacking. At high volume levels, needed when you are trying to do yard work, the sound quality is extremely distorted. I also find that I often accidentally change the volume level by inadvertently touching the control. Overall, I am not happy with this product."
1,Poor Reception,Very bad reception in the city as well as the suburbs. I can only listen to a number of radio stations without interference.
2,Waste of money,"The reception is poor, the number of stations is small, and the ear-pieces aren't that comfortable. Might as well pay twice as much for a [money] no-skip CD-player, or [money] for a radio reciever that actually transmits."
2,Easy to use but can't hold a station,"We bought this radio over the weekend and, when it arrived were supremely disappointed in its performance. While it is easy to use and set, it can't receive or hold a signal worth anything. Should have gotten the sony...*sigh*"
4,"Easy functions, pretty good reception","At half the price of the Sony, this armband is well worth it. For the average runner, you really don't need anything more complicated. I get good reception and although the earphones take some getting used to, they're pretty secure."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this Koss radio because it was small, light-weight, and had a stop watch feature which would be perfect to use during my workouts at Green Lake in Seattle. I was so excited when it arrived, but my excitement quickly changed to disappointment the first time I tried to use it and didn't get any reception. I know there is great reception at Green Lake because I have a larger Walkman that works just fine. My advice to potential buyers would be... Don't waste your time, you will likely be as disappointed as I am!"
1,Poor reception in and out of the city,"I bought this radio to use on the walking portions of my daily commute from downtown Chicago to the suburbs (I take the train in between). Unfortunately the reception is terrible in both places: multiple stations fading in and out with bursts of static common. I had hoped that the digital tuning would give improved reception over my old analog Sony, but no! I may have to fish the old Sony out of the trash -- as bad as it can be, it's better than this one, alas. Very disappointing!"
1,Really bad reception,"Constant static with nearly all radio stations, even stations with very powerful recievers. I returned mine after one use..."
2,Have you broken your belt clip yet?,"It works well, but the belt clip is too fragile, the first one broke within an hour when I bumped my desk with it. I took it back and got another, it lasted about 3 months, and started to crack and eventually broke off again. I doubt that I can find parts for it, but if you know where please let me know."
2,Useless product and very bad reception,"I liked the fact that the walkman was very light and easy to carry around, but the reception is just terrible. I was able to listen to only one radio station (sometimes). The earphones are a pain to use and the foam covers came off very easily. I lost one of them soon after purchasing the item. Don't bother buying this product."
2,Not too happy with this...,"I've had this radio for about 3 months. The headset is great, never having fallen out of my ears with daily 30 minute running use. Unfortunately, the headset stopped working this week due to a broken wire inside the connector. I also have trouble with the reception of some stations that come in fine on other radios. Overall, I'm not happy."
2,No Reception,"I ordered this item despite the reviews talking about the poor reception. MY MISTAKE!!! I live in Dayton, Oh and could only pick up 2 rock and 2 country stations. There are a ton of stations between Dayton and Cincinnati that I should be able to receive. I sent the radio back. Sony here I come."
1,"Cheap product, step up and buy the Sony",I bought one of these...the reception is pretty spotty and the headphone jack broke within a month rendering it useless. What a piece of junk.
2,Poor battery life,"Maybe I just got a lemon, but the battery only lasted about 2 weeks and I was only using it about 2 hrs/week. As you can imagine, this was extremely frustrating...so I tossed it in the trash at the gym. The sound quality was fine, and it was tiny, but I couldn't get over it never working."
1,"Bad reception, goofy control buttons, earphones(??!!)","Local stations drift in and out. You have to twist it up in front of your face to figure out which of the many little buttons changes stations. After several weeks' use, you still wonder ""what in the world does that knob do?"". Look at this stupid earphones -- worthless. Get a Sony!"
4,Koss PP257 Review,"I agree with ""An electronics fan"" - ignore the bad review. It's light, it will mount easily on anything, and reception is good enough in both bands indoors and out. I used to live close to Green Lake - this radio WILL pick up local AM and FM stations there. If you want to receive distant stations, pick a more powerful radio and deal with the bulk and weight penalty."
2,Poor Reception,"This purchase was a waste of money, since I found the reception to be too inconsistent when engaged in any activity such as running. Stations fade in and out. I don't use it anymore. Next time I'll get a portable MP3 player."
4,Overall great product but ear pieces not sweat resistant,"I use this product for almost any outdoor activiy from yardwork to running. Features are convenient particularly when you have one hand on the lawn mower,weedeater, etc... I live fairly far from most of the radio towers in the area and reception is good. Which I can not say for the Sony radio this Koss replaced. The clock is a geat feature for those who do not like to wear a watch when excercising. The earpieces are a little odd, but once in place they are secure. If you sweat a lot, the sound will diminish significantly when the earpieces get wet. For the price, you really can't beat this radio. But be ready to buy a different headset of you are prone to sweat."
4,A great radio for outdoors,I use to jog every morning and I love to hear music... This little gadget its a great deal for those who only wants to hear the radio.
4,Slice of Life Movie,"This movie was a like looking through a peep hole in a wall at the lives of some off beat, sad, out of the ordinary people. It shows us that there is value in everyones life, no matter how strange they seem to us. It was worth a look!"
4,"Excellent Sound Quality, Some in Stereo","This is a typical reissue of Johnny Tillotson's early hits. Included in true stereo are ""Poetry In Motion"" and the more rare ""Talk Back Trembling Lips"". Eighteen tracks in all, seven are in true stereo. Sound quality could be from the original master tapes, although there is no mention of this is on the CD."
3,Okay mix,"This disc is actually part of a 4-disc set of classical music; hence the subtitle of Volume Two. The pieces included are all famous classics, and familiar to anyone who has spent time listening to classical music. The performances however, are so-so; good sound quality but okay delivery. Each piece on the CD is also only a portion of the whole piece, which is understandable seeing that this is a compilation. Unfortunately, the pieces could have been longer as this CD is only 68 minutes long, and a CD can easily accompany 80 - 90 minutes worth of music."
4,You must own this gem....,"What can I say about this gem? It is a change from Mondo Grosso's previous efforts but this makes it all the more worthwhile to have. Imagine putting a compilation together with N'Dea Davenport, Tania Maria, Amel Larrieux and Monday Michiru. Well here it is in the flesh and you had better get it.I would have paid the price just for Amel Larrieux's, Now you know better, which simmers, then cooks and then absolutely boils over. If ever a tune could move you from one level to another then that is it. Tania Maria is at her eccentric best and gets you grooving in that Brazillian way that only she can. Life which is a lovely groovy latin track which also cooks is another reason for getting hold of this gem.It's a pity the 30 second listening doesn't give you a real appreciation of what the tracks on the album are all about. All I can say is take my word for it and you won't be dissapointed."
5,"Cool,Progressive","I enjoyed this album tremendously, The sounds are deep and rich. I like the mix of cool and progressive jazz with lots of spoken word that inspires thought.I also love the brazilian tunes that transport you to another place. You can also raise the volume and dance to some of the tracks at your next party. Dont know who she is but her vocals are some of the best I've ever heard, Her voice brings richness to this work. I highly recommend this album to those who can openn their minds to a variety of flavors."
3,It sounds like 4 HERO but not as good,"There's a few good tracks in this album only like #1, 3, 13, The rest sound way too brazilian or tropical and repetitive."
4,you gotta get this,this is a great cd. it takes you on worldly journeys. From the mellow club to the beat of brazil then back to the poetry of the lower east side. a must buy in my book. i just have to check out the remix album. star suite is amazing (blaze rmx) if you haven't heard it in the shelter you missed out.
4,"Solid, but not blown away. But hey, it's a muffler.","It is an OEM style muffler, not a show piece. For that purpose, I think it will work fine. That said, the seams are a little sloppy, both on the end caps and the longitudinal seam of the 'skin.' And the welds for the mounting pins are pretty rough. And it arrived with a few small dings and one shallow dent (nothing big enough to make me want to return it). I'll guess those happened during the manufacturing process because the box showed zero wear. But again, it's a muffler, so as long as everything lines up and it doesn't leak, I'll be happy."
4,Your getting what you pay for,Good deal on price but not the greatest quality- Ikea like qualityscratches really easy and little flimsy
2,looked great on the site...but,This item looked great and the colors and size where perfect. Shipment arrived just when it should have but once I opened the package I noticed I was missing a major part( a left panel) so I had to contact Winsome after about half an hour on the phone looks like I might maybe someday in a few weeks get the side panel I need to put this item together. The stainless steel top is dented too but I figure at this point just hoping I get the left panel so I can get it together. I will not but any Winsome product ever again.
2,R.I.P. - O.F.F.,"Between E.T., Poltergeist, and yes Star Wars, this movie had nothing original to it! And I'm not just talking about the plot, I'm talking lighting effects, camera angles.......And I also found myself dozing off more than once during this movie.If you liked this movie, I recomend: Watching something better, like E.T. or Star Wars or something like that.What I learned from ""Making Contact"": Dummies are frickin scary...o wait, I already knew that."
1,DRIVEL!,"Somewhere between 'Pippi Longstocking' [yes, this one does have animated braids ala Barrymore], 'Sorry, wrong number' [that would have been cool], and the regular tribe ""E.T."", 'Poltergeist', 'Close Encounters' and perhaps even the maglined ""MAGIC"" [what a cacophonous opening night in Hollywood that was way back] - lies this little sleeping gem of a ripoff .... lucking our director moved on to bigger and better things [if we forgive ""Godzilla""] ... but this little flaunt?NAH!only really GOOD THING is the somewhat obscure German actress playing mutti [mama] - quite a find back then - Dietrich before the implants!"
4,Good Insights for Troubled Times,Ralph Dull provides good insights on practical nonviolence tactics. His story of defusing a violent confrontation in a peace demonstration is a great lesson on how a true desire for peace can be a far more effective defense than baiting your enemies.He also tells some of the little known victories of effective nonviolent resistance of Nazis. Quite thought provoking.
1,Earthtones smooth jazz pap,"I ordered a couple of the Earth Tone series CD's because it was advertised in the same category as Govinda ( if you like that , you will like this etc.) Well let me just make this very clear-It is not in the same class as Govinda at all! Govinda is original art and very modern. Earth Tones is the worst bunch of smooth jazz synthesized hoakie pap I ever wish to listen to. An insult to American Indian Flute, it has no soul or feeling and is insibidly light and fluffy. I can see some 70 year old person listening and feeling pretty hip and smug. It's been done a million times already and plays in elevators nationwide!"
3,Cute toy!,"Got it for my 2 year old's birthday. So far the only thing negative I will say about it is the ""screen"" half is a bit top heavy. Other than that it is great for an Elmo lover"
2,"Very good, but...",This is a great educational toy laptop. The only problem is that it was designed so that when opened for use it doesn't stand on its own. The screen section has to be propped against something to allow it to be used like mom or dad's lap top.
4,Good Option for Preschool Laptop,"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas she was 19 months at the time and she liked to push the buttons but didn't get the game totally so she quickly lost interest. Now, she is enjoying the game and with my assistance is interacting with Elmo. I like the different skills that it reinforces (counting, shapes, colors). The only thing I do not like about this toy is that the cartridges fall out of their slot easily. Otherwise, the toy seems very durable. We haven't had any problems and we haven't had to replace the batteries yet."
3,"Good toy, but a few minor problems","My 2-year-old daughter received the Fisher-Price Sesame Street Learning Fun Laptop as a Christmas gift. It has some sound educational value, teaching children shapes, letters, numbers, and colors. My daughter often becomes frustrated when she plays with the laptop, however. First, the laptop is top heavy. If the screen is not facing forward somewhat, then it falls backward. The only time it does not fall backward is when the screen is facing so far toward the screen that it's difficult to see. The various screens give the laptop variety, and they're easy for a 2 or 3 year old to change out. However, after the screen is changed out, the computer does not recognize that the screen has been changed. Thus, I have to turn off the laptop and turn it back on to reset it. Great toy, but can be very frustrating."
3,Too top heavy,"This toy is a cute idea and my 23 month old LOVES Elmo. However, once it's out of the box, it doesn't sit up. The top (where Elmo's eyes are) is too heavy so it causes the laptop to fall over. He still enjoys it, but it isn't his favorite....or mine either!"
2,Elmo computer doesn't compute,"We bought this toy for our [...] daughter. She is a huge Elmo fan. It seemed to work out of the box with the slide in card for ABC's, but some of the additional cards did not read correctly. They seemed to have the wrong graphics. This made this potentially great educational toy somewhat useless. I have heard that the Fisher-Price laptops have been plagued with problems and this is true in our experience. We took it back and would not buy another."
3,Fun but has some issues,Like many other reviewers the first laptop we bought didn't work and we had got a replacement. The replacement worked just fine for several months and now one of the number buttons is broken. My three year old loves to play with it but often gets frustrated because it's hard to understand what Elmo is saying.
2,Problems reading the different cards,"Daughter received this as a gift. The concept is nice since she loves to touch my grown up laptop, but the laptop does not effectively ""read"" the different cards that are included. Disappointing to me, but she'll still love using the one card that it does read!"
2,Disappointed,"Was surprised this toy doesn't play any songs. Seems like manufacturer missed the mark when they designed this. I agree with one of the other reviewers, the top half (screen half) is very heavy and the toy often falls backwards because of its weight."
2,Cute but annoying,"My son loves Elmo and my husband's laptop, so this seemed like a good idea. The age range is a lot lower than some of the others on the market, which helped too. Little did I know how annoying it is. He has the most fun pulling the lever repeatedly and the beeping noise will drive you nuts. The runnning joke at Christmas was if we will let him play with it in the car on our 12 hour trip home (Milwaukee, WI - Horseheads, NY), it would be on the side of the road by Chicago if it even made it that far. My son does love the laptop but doesn't understand the questions that it is asking. When he gets a little bit older, this will be a great learning toy."
2,not impressed,"We bought this for our 21 month old daughter for Christmas, she rarely plays with it and when she does she simply likes to take the different cartridges out and put them back in. We also have a three year old that likes to take the cartridges in and out but other than that, it does not get played with it. Waste of money. Would not buy again."
1,Cute idea but not very durable,"I was so excited about this toy for my 16 month old daughter. She squealed with delight when she opened it at Xmas. Unfortunately, the thing only worked for about 1 day. Then it TRIED to work but would only get about half way through a word and stop... like the batteries were dying. We replaced the batteries (my husband even checked the batteries with a voltage meter and they're fully functioning) and it still doesn't work. Very disappointing. On the bright side, I called Fisher Price and they're replacing the toy free of charge, so we'll see if the replacement is any better."
1,Bad Education,"The Fisher-Price Laptop toys are plagued with problems. Our brand new Elmo Laptop fails to ask questions for more than 80% of the lever pulls, and mis-reads most of the inserted cards, asking irrelevant and unanswerable questions about other scenes.The Barney laptop (same company) can be considerably more buggy, see customer reviews here:Barney Laptop.Be careful with this junk. Very disappointing to have grandma bring a buggy toy brought all the way to the Philippines, only to take it right back for a return."
3,"Good toy, but has problems","Others wrote that it asks questions that are for a different screne. I noticed this too, but how to fix it is, when you push in the disc it will think it's the old one unless it clicks and plays a song.I don't like that it won't stand on it's own when open it falls over.And 4 of the buttons broke within the first few days. But I am in the process of exchanging it for a new one. My sons likes it, I wish I could give it a better review."
1,Keeps Tipping Over - Poor Quality Overall,"When you open the screen it keeps flopping over, and it seems that no matter which computer card you put in, the buttons and the messages seem to do and say the exact same thing. Plus there's no volume control...and this thing is LOUD. Not very educational either...the screen references letters but the keypad is only numbers and shapes. Overall, not a very good toy. Like others have said, you are better off with Leap Frog toys."
4,Pun-derful,"Another in the series by this talented author/artist, Insectlopedia is a great adventure for adult and child alike. Children are encouraged to learn about the natural world in a series of poems and illustrations that are engaging, humorous and informative. Florian writes charming verse that informs, but even better, when read aloud, the tongue-twisting alliteration stimulates curiosity and laughter.""Mosquitoes are thin.Mosquitoes are rude.They feast on your skinFor take-out food.""Insectlopedia is fun for beginning readers, certainly a bonus in engaging their interest in words and images. The nonsense menu includes: the dragonfly, the daddy longlegs, the inchworm, the walkingstick, the giant waterbug, the termite, the locusts and the ticks.As for ""The Praying Mantis"":""A caterpillar,MothOr bee-I swallow themReligiously.""Luan Gaines/2005."
1,"Poor quality phone, poor quality answering","Features on this phone are great - that is until you try to use the (easy to implement) features. For the phone - unless you talk directly into the microphone, you won't be heard on the other end. Does not seem to be capable of picking up voice unless directly aimed at the mike. As for the answering machine - it works pretty well but if you want to record an outgoing message you might as well be talking into a tuna can. The voice quality is awful - reminds me of some of the first answering machines ten or fifteen years ago. My recommendation is that you pass on this turkey unless you want to send it back for exchange."
1,simply horrible,"everything about the phone is bad. the answering system, the voiceon the answering system, the ability to fast forward through messages...go waste your money on something better than this!"
2,the Joneses golden soul classics,"Does any one out there know how to get a copy of the Joneses 1974 hit ""Hey Babe"""
1,these are not the Joneses I know,"The Jonses I'm thinking of, sung a song called Sugar pie guy, then followed it up with Love Inflation.Are these the same Jonses? Help me pick up the right Joneses."
5,Could not live without this pillow.,This product has been so important to breastfeeding at night or doing anything at night with my babies. This is one of my number 1 products for supporting breastfeeding. Now my toddler loves to look at the pillow as he is going to sleep.
1,Bad product and bad service!,"I am a doctor from Miami, time is important to me.I thought that I did my homework, I read all the reviews, etc...I guess the people who are satisfied with this product are simply naive! This shaver is a complete disappointment and on top of that if you want to return, good luck! You will get those nice emails from amazon' customer service telling you that they cannot accept the refills (dangerous hazards in shipping) while they shipped it to you!! it's ok for them and not ok for you ! Moreover you need to call the company directly on your own. Of course did I mention that the company wants you to return the refills to amazon not to them?What a frustrating deal.I was Amazon # 1 fan, I purchased almost everything from them (books, equipments, DVD's, etc...), not anymore."
1,Product Failure,"This product has a small L shaped part, which attaches the motor to the oscillator. It is very small and has small notches on the sides. This part snapped after the shaver was just over 2 years old. Braun wants me to ship (packing time, driving to the post office, extra cost) or drive (45 min) the product to a local repair center, which is obviously not worth the trouble and cost.Just thought I'd share my experience. I would not buy this product again."
4,braun 6690,"I've owned this razor for 1 year and I am very happy with the results. /the only problem I have encountered is when you change the liquid cartridge, sometimes the new cartridge does not apply the liquid to your face until several shaves have gone by. Otherwise for the price and results you cannot beat it!!!!"
1,Not recommended to have clean shave,"I have been using from december 2003. Iam planning to get rid of it as it doesnt shave well under chin. Doesnt work well at neck areas. I have to do couple of times in different directions to have clean shave. I Do not recommend this. Also I feel my beard is growing too fast after using this.Only the applicator (shaving gel) is great. Also while charging, it doesnt charge completely at once. It does go off and on several times in a day. I keep it hooked to the power outlet.Anyone please recommend me a good one. After a thorough research, i bought this and my research proved me wrong"
4,Explorations Indeed: Adventurous New Music.,"David Holzman is brilliant! This recording is yet another example of Holzman's unique capabilities. Aside from this, there is a thread that ties this great pianist to the music of two of the composers on this recording: that of the German born composer Stephan Wolpe (1902-1972). [Wolpe was a student of, among others, most notably Anton Webern]. David Holzman is known for his exceptional performances and recordings of Wolpe's piano music. Not surprisingly, the most engaging pieces on this CD come from two composers who studied composition with Wolpe: Raoul Pleskow and Matthew Greenbaum. Pleskow's ""Piano Sonata No. 2"" and Greenbaum's ""Amulet"" both benefit from Holzman's experience and understanding of Wolpe's musical world. - A highly recommended recording for those interested in the development of new music for the piano and the piano music of Wolpe and Webern."
5,Excellent Book,Extremely useful. New edition provides strategies for today's selling market. Highly recommended.
5,Eye Opener,"I recently read this book that I issued from Chicago Public Library. I am a management graduate & have read lot of books. Though I read management/sales books, I hate them as I find them very generic. So, I picked up this book just for the heck of it. I generally finish books in 3-4 hours but this book is just so different. It made me think & rethink what I am doing as a sales person. It was quite an eye opener. I have been buying things online for the last 6 years but this is the first time when I really felt like buying a bought online. This book is a must READ. I would recommend it to all sales people irrespective of how many years of sales experience you have. Happy reading... Brajesh (brajesh2@yahoo.com)"
5,Acapella at its finest,This is the Persuasions in their best voice. The energy and intonation as well as the selection of music is the finest available. You can not do better than this for acapella music.
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"Before I ordered this unit I read the other two reviews. One said it was poorly made the other liked it. I have to agree with the first. The quality is not there. If you are the least bit picky save yourself the trouble of having to return it. Cheaply made is the best description. Spend the extra money and buy a Bosch, Porter Cable or DeWalt"
2,Cheap Quality,"Not very happy with the frame, but you get what you paid for. The corners had chipped off even before I took out of the package. I will not buy this frame again."
2,You get what you pay for,"This picture frame looks nice from a distance. However, it is made of cheap material - therefore it's cheap to buy. I'm all for cheap but only if it is not defected. One corner is coming apart as the staples have fractured it. I thought about returning it but I just gave it some superglue and hope it holds up. I won't buy any more."
2,Beautiful but flimsy - Buyer beware!,"The frame arrived 2 days after purchase, carefully packaged and unbroken. The simple, modern black frame and white mat are very attractive, and I was pleased to frame and hang my friend's original painting. But a few days later, the frame was hanging crookedly. Upon closer inspection, I found that the frame is made of a crumbly synthetic material, held together with flimsy staples. The staples have separated from the frame, and the frame is already coming apart. I only hung it on the wall a few days ago, and have not touched it since! I mended the frame with superglue, but I am not pleased with the poor workmanship. I will NOT purchase another."
4,Book was recommended by LCSW,I haven't completed the book but I am enjoying it hope it helps It is amazing how women including myself under estimate themsleves
4,Arrived in great condition,"I have not yet read the entire book, however it did arrive in great shape. From just reading the first chapter I believe that I will get a lot out of this book"
4,Satisfied,"I like the condition of the book. i got it to give someone as a gift. The books arrived on time. Quite satisfied, overall."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND MISLED,"As a Christian, I was very offended by the views and statements in this book. Sue Patton Thoele (author) states in this book...""Is it possible that we are made in the image of a Mother God, a feminine creator, a divine spiritual essence? We're beginning to accept the answer as yes.""Sue continues to lead her readers into using the divine feminine within and uses what SHE calls ""prayer"" as a means of overcoming negative emotions. This ""prayer"" is either directed inward to oneself or to a Mother/Father God, not to God in heaven.To top it all off, she has one of her chapter topics labeled ""bitch"". I know that the same points in this section could be made in a much more tasteful way.If you are considering this book and have any belief in God whatsoever, you may be offended as I was and be very disappointed that you wasted your time and money."
3,Worth reading,"This book is worth reading, but it contains no real helpful information except to ""go get help"". The author is a trained professional, and you do feel like you are sitting on a sofa but she is doing all the talking and not saying much. Perhaps my reaction to this book is because I had already read other books that went indepth on these subjects and she merely touches them. Sorry Sue."
5,Excellent book!!,"This is an example of a book you can share with many. Sue Patton Thoele is a Licensed Psychotherapist, who writes about her own experiences in life. She reaches for the inner you-by focusing on thoughts,emotions,fears, anxiety,etc.Sue Patton Thoele helps guide the reader buy giving exercises ,that are very relaxing. She gives examples of patients problems that, I could relate to. I will use this book for guidance ,through out the journeys in my life, as I think everyday can be a struggle depending on how we look at things.Keeping positive things in our life; is certainly what we all need to do. We can make our world a better place just by reaching for simple things in our life to keep us on the right track."
1,Too vague for me,"I was very hopefully after reading the reviews that this book had much to offer. However, I found it was full of generalities and vague concepts that seem insubstantiated - just ideas and the author's personal insights. Pretty writing but just fluff for me. I guess I was hoping for a more results based methodology. This just encourages a personal journey that was unclear. Even the author says she still struggles with trying to find and be her true ""self"", so what confidence does this give the reader of doing the same under her instruction?"
1,Not useable for a Delta table saw.,"This product was not usable on my saw. If you use both left and right discs, the table insert will not fit. If you use the left disc, it warps the blade and makes it tilt to the right. It had no effect on vibration when using only one disc. I returned the discs."
2,To thick,"I have an older table saw and when I tried to install them along with the blade & a required shaft spacer, I could not put on the retaining nut. So I could only use one Blade Stabilizer on my saw."
2,"Unable to secure with thin kerf blades, OK for thick but not needed.","I've used one of these with two blades. One is a thin kerf Freud available at HD and the other is a thick kerf DeWalt. With the thin kerf Freud I tighten the arbor nut, turn the saw on, turn the saw off, and the blade spins on the arbor. This is dangerous. With the thick kerf the arbor nut stays tight but the stabilizer isn't needed with a thick kerf blade. I'm returning this item."
5,saw blade stabilizer,"Following some of the other review suggestions, I bought the set and installed one plate on my table saw and one on my radial arm saw. Between adding a link belt and the stabilizer to my table saw, I now have virtually no vibration in the table saw. With the radial arm saw being direct drive there was less noticeable difference for vibration, but the saw cut is beautiful. I especially like the 3.5"" size of these plates in that they take away very little cutting depth from my 10"" saws. I would recommend them as a simple and inexpensive way to upgrade the quality of your saws."
1,Freud Blade Stabilizer,"Useless and overpriced gudget. Blade can't be placed on calibrated 5/8"" shaft and sits over the thread. As a result balance is off and you can't turn on a saw without the risk of blowing your brains out."
4,Squirrels VS Humans,"Forestby Janet Taylor LisleForest is about a town that consists of Upper Forest and Lower Forest. Upper Forest is home to lots of mink tail squirrels, but Lower Forest is home to humans. The story is about one mink tail that thinks war is the answer to a situation where the dad of a family goes to bring down the very large squirrel population. This squirrel is obviously wrong. A few squirrels and the children of the dad have to stop this other squirrel and most of the squirrel population.I found this book very good, although it took a while for me to get into it. One thing that I really enjoyed about the book was that even though the squirrels could speak their own language neither the humans nor the squirrels could understand each other. So, the two groups had to find another way to resolve their issues with each other. I would recommend this book to people who like weird things. If you like page-turners, this is another great reason to read Forest."
3,an ok book,ForestBy: Janet Taylor LisleThe book I read this month is Forest by Janet Taylor Lisle. Forest is a fiction book.The story is describing Upper and Lower forests. Several kids are exploring the forest. Anyone who looked up from lower forest grew dizzy. When the children found something in the forest it was an amazing sight. Most parents got worried when the kids went to the forest because they thought it was dangerous.This book was ok but not my kind of book and not exciting enough.
5,"a warm, cute story",Just marvelous! This one for entertainment. A book kids can lose themselves in and make friends with.
1,It doesnt work on my PS3,"This cable doesn't have te original connector to the PS3, its only 2 HDTV connectors, no PS3 and HDTV."
5,One of my new favorite CDs,"It's not quite pop. It's not quite rock. But damn if the songs aren't catchy, the lyrics incredibly honest. Definitely one of my new favorite cd's. A great find and a great buy for someone looking for something new."
5,Empowering both parents and children,"Children don't share our perspectives. Developmentally they have very different needs than the adults in their lives. Divorce can rock even the firmest foundation we have given them. This book gives parents the ablility to seek simple solutions from different perspectives. Answers that were easy, can get more complicated with divorce and it is refreshing to find solutions that use common sense, and place not winning or losing but succeeding as the goal, The authors, understand both children and parent needs, and the importance of building good relationships for all involved. I highly recommend this book, I have had opportunities to put the authors' guidelines to use and they work - for both parents and children, empowering all involved."
5,Prayers from the Ark,This is a whimsical book - as much for adults as for children - great to read aloud to children - and wonderfully illustrated.
2,Disappointed in quality of product,"I received two copies of PRAYERS FROM THE ARK AND THE CREATURES CHOIR by Carmen Bernos de Gaztold. Although I love this book, the copies I received were not in very good condition. Since there were no new copies available, I had ordered used copies, one purportedly in very good condition and the other in good condition. I would downgrade each of them. In other words, the copy supposedly in very good condition, was barely in good condition, and the copy supposedly in good condition was only in fair or poor condition. I was disappointed. However, for anyone who is interested, the content of the book is joyful, beautiful, gorgeous!"
5,An old friend,This is a replacement for an old favorite. I must have loaned it to a friend and not gotten it back. It is so charming as it catches something of the creatures.
3,Public Personnel Management,"Nice layout, but the context is very compact. Too much general & superficial descriptions. The language used in each chapter is not smooth for reader to follow what he/she is talking about."
3,I didn't get it but personally I think I wouldn't like it.,I didn't get this but I do have my eye on Angry Beavers stuff. I almost got it then I just record music from The Angry Beavers but it seems to me that Rugrats is getting the attention...Where isthe Beaver Fever? Where istherest? I know there could be a few more songs from TAB on it.
4,"Little Mediocre, But Good Nonetheless.","""The Best of Nicktoons"" is a great album compared to its follow-up, ""The Newest Nicktoons,"" which had no other songs for ""SpongeBob SquarePants,""""Rocket Power,"" ""Invader ZIM,"" ""Pelswick,"" ""ChalkZone,"" and ""The Fairly OddParents"" besides the theme songs.The only highlights are all the Nicktoons that are on Nicktoons Network now: ""Rugrats,"" ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""Rocko's Modern Life,"" ""Hey Arnold,"" & ""CatDog."" Sadly, ""AAAHH! Real Monsters,"" ""KaBlam,"" and ""The Angry Beavers"" are not on Nicktoons Network anymore (I still like it however).And where's the Doug songs? I think Doug was stuck in repeats and they couldn't find anything. Also, where's the stuff from ""The Wild Thornberrys"" and ""Oh Yeah! Cartoons""?Anyway I can't really listen to it because my copy's missing and I don't know where it is.However...HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY!"
2,Very Small Tube,If you are expecting a large Truck inner-tube you will be disappointed.Do not go by pictures in the product listing.This is much too small for even a small adult to use.
1,Deceiving information,The write up mentioned good for snow sledding. It is absolutely not. The tube was thin and small. My young children could not even hold themselves up because the tube was too small and close to the ground.
3,tire tube synopsis,Not using this for a tire do not want to mislead someone that is.Put it in my pool for winter to prevent ice. I will not know if I like it until spring.
5,Great for the river,"The thick rubber in this tube stands up well to rocks and other hazards in river tubing. It also inflates to a size that is fine for me, a 170 lb male. I've tried to find the maximum safe inflation pressure online, but I haven't found anything yet. Just blow it up until it is the right size and you will be happy with it, I promise."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS TUBE FOR A PICKUP,"I bought this tube with the intension of using it on my Ford F150 pickup. When the tube arrived, to my surprise and my anger the valve stem was huge. The stem was about 4"" long and the diameter was too large for my wheel. I checked into returning the tube. To return it, I would have to pay to send it back to shipper. The shipper would then deduct the amount from my refund that shipper had paid to send it to me. BY paying shipping twice would ofcourse be about the price I had paid for the tube in the first place. So, I could either keep the tube I could not use or pay for a tube I no longer had.Slime 5001-A Raw Auto Inner Tube - 700/750 R15/16"
2,Low Budget Tubing,"Despite the small size when not inflated the tube can get fairly large. I inflated mine to about 3.5' in diameter. PSI does not really play a role here, since there is no tire around it. I tried finding what the recommended PSI rating is but wasn't able to... I don't think it applies.The tube popped on me half way through our adventure at Harpers Ferry on the Potomac. Not sure if the tube is really to blame, the water was fairly low and I did hit a few large rocks. These tubes also deform fairly easily, and are not very comfortable to ride. This was my first tubing trip on an auto inner tube and we all got fairly bad arm rashes from paddling.If I had a chance, I would definitely ""splurge"" and spend the extra $8 for one designed for water tubing exclusively, and maybe also purchase a cheap canoe paddle. Because of the deformity, rash and having to walk 4 miles back to the car, I rate this 2 stars for water tubing purposes."
3,Disapointed,We purchased 2 of these tubes to go tubing down a crick at our cabin. I went by the other reviews that said the tubes were the perfect size for adults if you blow them up enough. Other people stated they were too small but many others said they just didn't blow them up enough. We took them to the cabin and used our heavy duty air compressor. My husband put so much air in it he thought it might explode so he stopped. It was still too small. Our 12 year old son couldn't even use this tiny tube.
3,Used for river rafting,"We bought two of these for a camping trip that our family took on a local river and they were primarily used by our 5 and 3 year old boys. They were quick to inflate with an air compressor at a local gas station/grocery store near the campground. They were strong enough to last the entire camping trip while being used by both our two boys and by our neighbors two children as well. When it was time to breakdown camp I was dismayed to see how slowly they deflated... 20+ minutes per tube with a ball point pen in the valve stem. The price was right though, so I can't really complain.In summary, if you are looking to get some of these ""truck"" tubes for river rafting, then I would suggest getting ones that are larger if possible... around 30"" or larger. These worked okay for our 5 and 3 year old kids, but speaking from experience, adults look slightly foolish rafting on tubes that are this small. Also, don't forget that it takes forever and a day to deflate these things."
2,Lawn mower tire tube ?,If your planning to use this as a floating devise say to shoot the rapids in the river then you better get something bigger. It is way to small for an adult.
1,"Awful, defective",I ordered two tires through amazon. One of them split open on a seem within two weeks. This was a complete waste of money.
3,Not all that big,"As far as snow-tubing is concerned, this tube is great for a child or perhaps a young teenager, but good luck fitting on it if you're adult! I think that an adult may have a better time water-tubing on it though. Fully inflated, this tube comes up to my thigh while standing."
2,It was good while it lasted...,"I had a lot of fun with this for about 2 hours. We used it while sledding and built a big ramp out of snow at the bottom of a hill. The innertube worked better than the other sleds we had available to us. It seemed pretty tough, but it was easily slashed open by a small twig. Don't use this for sledding if there's a chance that you'll be running into anything hard."
1,inner tubes for very small people!,"These tubes are way too small for anyone except someone 5 years or under. Not suitable for river tubing, look more like bike tubes! Picture is deceptive."
1,Simply deadful.,".If you and I set out to make a ""worst of the 70's album,"" we would have a hard time matching wits with the geniuses that put this one together.Of the thousands of 70's compilations I have examined, this is the worst. This album deserves no stars.scottie"
5,Learning About Weather,This book in the Cat in the Hat series is a great introduction to young readers about the different aspects of weather. It is a really cute well-written book.
5,Great book -- both informative and fun,"If your child seems ready to explore weather beyond just understanding rain, snow, and sun, then this is a great book to have. It provides a wealth of information about weather in a way that is fun and catchy (Dr. Seuss-esque rhymes and pictures). The content is slightly above my very verbal 3.5-year-old's head, but with my explanations and clarifications, he gets most of it. I think it is a book he will continue to grow into as he gets older, appreciating a little more each time he reads it, and finally being able to fully understand it all. I'd say this book is ideal for a 5-6-year-old but still okay for a younger child who is curious about the weather."
3,applied bayesian forecasting and time series analysis,"Pole et al.'s small primer on bayesian time series analysis is a good first step for an outsider to the area. The book is split into two parts. The first gives a favourable treatment of bayesian analysis. The second half of the book is an extended tutorial to accompany the canned program and data set included with the text.The program itself is easy to use, although in talking with people who have worked through the book, they seem to have gone on to write their own code rather than rely on the program, BATS."
4,A good introduction to dinamic models,"This is a hands-on introduction to bayesian forecasting and dinamic models. After a brief overview on theory, it leads you to some fully developed examples. The second part of the book simply develop some examples on the BATS program supplied with the book. They clearly feature the main capabilities of the program. The main drawback is that all the book is focused on that program, so BF and DM are glossed over. So, a reading to the theory focused book ""bayesian forecasting and dinamic models"" from Harrison is mandatory for a deeper dive into this issue."
4,Old School Movie,"To Sleep with Anger was a 'sleeper' that went by un-noticed and did not receive much recognition. It is one of my favorite movies because it is so subtle without getting too deep.This movie has many understated nuances that could have been explored a little bit more,and this is what makes the movie special.It leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusions about the character of Harry (Danny Glover). On the surface he is smooth & charming,and seems innocent enough. One wonders if it is his ill-intentions that creates szhism & discord,chaos and confusion in his interactions with others?The movie takes a diversion which helps to create the suprising ending. This movie may appear a little dated;and it does send out a message that is so appropo for those who have ever dealt with rift-raft.Check out this movie for Old School performance with down south sensibilities.A charmer."
4,"On Ray Charles' ""Standards""","I had been looking for Ray Charles' version of ""Ruby"" Could not find his version on the web sites where I usually buy music.Finally discovered on Amazon and found it on the CD ""Standards""Aterrific album. Some of my most favorite ballads on this one. If you like Ray Charles it's a great collections of songs. Gertrude"
4,12 SMOOTH SONGS,1. El Nino2. Circle Of Fire3. Carolyn4. Little Island5. Sudden Breeze6. Red Car7. Boomerang8. East West9. Zuma10. Hong Kong Rain11. Senor Samurai12. Pacific RimGreat smooth jazz and ambient sound.
3,Poorly Designed Fence,"This biscuit joiner has a lot going for it. Inexpensive price tag, nice blade, fairly stable base for biscuit jointing smaller stock (NOT requiring the adjustable fence). Even with those nice features, this tool causes a LOT of aggravation. The most irritating thing about this tool is the fence! It uses a single screw on the side to create enough pressure to hold the adjustable fence in place. There is a flaw to this simple system -- IT DOESN'T WORK. If you are able to achieve a square fence adjustment and you have just about stripped the screw to get the fence to stay in place; after 2 biscuit slots being cut, it will start slipping on you. It doesn't take much pressure at all to get it to slip, either. The other irritating feature about this biscuit joiner is the sound the motor makes. I would spring for the Porter Cable or DeWalt joiners."
2,Poor design,"I suppose it's a poor workman that blames his tools, but I find it quite difficult to make consistent cuts with this tool."
1,DISSATISFIED,"I received this unit 4 years ago as a gift from my father. I have only used it on two projects and while using it on the second project it died. The problem was traced to the windings in the motor. Terminal for a $100 tool even though it was only used to cut less than 50 biscuit slots. That aside, the rocker switch is in a very poor location and the fence adjustment is crude. This is not a slam on Freud as I recommend their saw and dado blades."
3,It's ok for the money,"The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.It does the basic job, it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much, do more, and not be annoyed by that aweful motor."
2,Too many specifics for general use,"Admittedly, the edition of this book that I read was from 1996, and there are later editions. I would assume that the book has gotten better, and the computer references have been updated. Nevertheless, unless you are hopelessly disorganized, the kind of person who appears on a ""hoarder"" show, this book provides so much lower level detail as to make its impractical for general purposes. If you need this much help with office organization, you would be better off hiring Ms. Hemphill."
3,You get what you. pay for,I bought these because they were so cheap. Almost immediately they began to fray. I should have bought leather gloves.
3,Thin ... but that is what I wanted,"These are the one size fits all glove.Thin & easy to complete tasks with.If you are looking for warmth, keep looking."
2,"Cheap price, even cheaper quality",The quality is pretty poor on these. They are thread bare in the thumb area and the hem on the finger part isn't solid so there is already fraying. You get what you pay for. It's not worth the effort of returning them since they were so inexpensive to begin with.
2,Cheap and it shows,I got a pair of these for 3.55. They were cheap and it shows. 3 of the finger holes have stray threads hanging out. One glove had a half-inch hole between the thumb and first finger when I took it out of the bag. I'm quite disappointed.
5,"Great Gloves, Great Seller","Great gloves! Also, when the US post office didn't get them to me, the seller sent another order free of charge. I was very happy with that."
4,great price!,"These gloves were not very well made, so I do not know how long they will last...BUT they were very well priced. My son loves them. I can't complain! Great packaging and fast shipping!"
1,not worth ordering,"Not worth ordering online. Go to a discount store and find the same thing and you won't have to pay for shipping. Which, by the way, was double the price of the gloves."
3,"Good fingerless gloves, bad gasoline smell.","Not much to say about these. They're a pair of cheap fingerless gloves that keep your hands warm and are comfortable. The only complaints I have is there are a bit of lose stands on the gloves at end of the fingers. (kinda looks like a pair of regular gloves with the ends of fingers cut off and bad sewing of ends) The gloves also have this ""gasoline"" like smell to them, can only imagine the kind of chemicals these were around in whatever factory they came from. I recommend a thorough washing of these before wearing."
3,Great gloves with a few flaws,"I ordered this with two day shipping and it only cost me about $11. My biggest concern was that these gloves would not fit my wrists since there so skinny, but to my surprise they were a perfect fit. They look great and are pretty comfortable, but I do have a problem with these gloves. Like most of the reviewers I immediately noticed that the gloves had many stray strings hanging and that can be a big problem if the gloves gets caught on something. Other then that flaw I can't really see anything wrong with these gloves. They fit perfect, look great, and it's worth the cheap price. I say buy them if you need some gloves that will not only look cool, but also keep your hands warm."
5,Very Good Product,"I was very pleased with these fingerless gloves. They're not too thin, but not too thick. At first glance, I was worried that they wouldn't fit on my larger hands, but they stretched easily and without creating gaps in the material. You can't beat the price for these at Gravity Trader at $2.49/pr. I bought 3 pairs. Other sellers, some on Amazon.com, are asking $6.00+ for the same item."
3,Perfection Unravelled,"These are great fingerless mittens and were exactly what I was looking for--Stretchy, comfortable, warm, and serve my purpose. The only problem is that the edges of the fingers aren't reinforced very well and began to unravel the day I got them. But for the super price, I will sit with my hot chocolate in front of the TV and reinforced them myself."
2,get what you pay for,"I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures. These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do. The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves. I ordered the black pair. Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily. They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily. But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for."
4,Exactly what I needed.,"Thin enough to play guitar with, thick enough to keep the wind from biting my hands. Frayed a little bit here and there, but still in good shape. Seems to get a little pilly, but no big deal. All around, for the price, very good deal."
3,cheap gloves; expensive shipping.,"I've purchased fingerless gloves exactly like this from a dollar store. They're quite ""handy"" for me, when I can find them. That's why I was willing to pay $2.79. What I did not know, was that I'd be paying over $5.00 for shipping; otherwise I'd have definitely looked elsewhere! Nevertheless, these cheapy-gloves are useful to wear indoors and keep my poor, cold, little hands warm while I still get all my stuff done. I take them off when I bathe, though."
3,You get what you pay for,"I ordered the gloves in order to keep my hands from freezing while driving in the mornings. It wasn't until after the 2nd day of use they started to unstitch and the material started to ball up. Love the feel of them, but the material could use an upgrade."
1,Cheaply Made,Both thumbs had small rips at the base and the fingers had threads that were already unravelling. Spend a little more for better quality.
5,Sheik's Spell and MORE!,"The author's first book was a classic. She must have personally felt every movement and thought; the characters seemed so real and personal. We are truly fortunate that this author has chosen to write her stories to convey her messages and provide enjoyment and excitement for all of her readers instead of for entirely commercial reasons. The world needs more authors like this to provide ""real life"" un-diluted dreams for all who chose to take advantage of the opportunity. We are truly honored to have had the privelege to have read her first draft. Don't stop til you get enough."
3,All original hits -- but not enough here.,"These elevan tracks form Collectables Records in 1994,includes 7 of the 9 songs Marv Johnson had chart, and 2 of the 7 b-sides.Missing is:""Come to me"" his first release in 1959 and a top 40 hit,and ""Ain't gonna be that way"" made the top 100 in 1960.A list of Johnson's A&B; sides can be found at the ""United Artists C.D.,'The Best of Marv Johnson, You got what it takes'in the comments of majormusiclover.That C.D. pictures Johnson's head to the right,with Marv Johnson in LARGE letters on the left,on a lavendar/plume colored background.There are at least two other collectionsthat are far better then this Collectables set.But there is one song here that isn't on the above mentioned'Best of' C.D. which is 'I need you',the b-side of '(You got to) move two mountains'."
5,Definitely a need-to-have book,"Look at this book and you will get so excited about everything you can do with your stash, especially the leftover trim and leaf. There's stuff in here you've never thought about and stuff you have thought about but didn't how to do- how to make pills, tinctures, butter, baked goods, everything. Looking at the pictures even got me motivated enough to actually try to do some of this, and that's definitely a feat. Read this book! Then cook for me."
4,Very basic information.,"The book is well written as are all books by Ed Rosenthal but I was hoping for more in depth info on how to make various tinctures, drinks and deserts.I was disappointed with the weak chapter on tinctures and nary a mention of drinks. The book however did an excellent job explaining several methods of removing THC from plant matter.If you are a novice you will love this book but the Veterans should look for a different source.Peace,Joe"
5,Great Book,"I learned many new uses for ""trash"" in this book. Each chapter covers how to use and make stash from trash!!!"
5,Ask Ed: Marijuana Gold: Trash to Stash,pretty good info. although its a little dated still some good info.small amount of pics and little on tinctures.
1,Poor publishing,The book is what I wanted but every other page is blank. I would return this item but I'm not sure if it would be worth the time.
1,Deceptive Advertising,"This Mirror has a plastic back & bracket for mounting, that will crack when tightened. Don't buy it. Go to PepBoys they have the full metal mirrors."
2,Too much concentration on contests,"Although the presentation of mother and daughter is delightful to watch (and they both have awesome looking bodies!), unfortunately the video fell short on its instructional format. Perhaps it is because we have all been so used to ""follow along with step-by-step"" workouts that following the program as outlined is difficult. Really too bad, because it could have been a terrific instructional video if so much time had not been spent in promoting the muscle buildup contests. Most of us who simply want to stay fit but not develop massive bodies really would not benefit much from this video. Having said that, my hat goes off to these two incredible ladies who have followed their quest to be champions."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for Gamecube,"I highly recommend this game. It was fun and entertaining. The disc game itself was ""like new"" when I played it. I didn't encounter any problem while playing it."
2,Warning: Need a chisel,"um, I just want to warn everyone to not use cement. Haven't been able to walk for two weeks."
2,Out of date,"It has some good general information, but is out of date in several major ways. Does not include any information regarding Domains, poor job describing charactoristics defing bacteria."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Right out of the box this saw looks cheap, (actually it is compared to most sliding compound miter saws) a quick assessment of it's functionality confirms the initial impression. Plastic and cast aluminum parts look cheap, locking pin nearly impossible to use, blade quality is OK, miter turret moves a little hard, blade guard is a strange contraption, no guard to prevent tear-out, and being an 8 1/2"" saw it's cutting capacity is seriously limited. There are a couple of nice features however -- the base gives the saw excellent stability while remaining compact. It's relatively lite and It's equipped with an electronic brake. In the end you'll be much better off stepping up to a Hatachi or Makita, They're wroth the extra money."
3,"Freud TR215 8-1/2"" compound miter saw","I bought this saw for one reason and one reason only, price. I've wanted a sliding compound miter saw for quite some time but have not been willing to invest $500 or more. I've had the saw for only a short time but have these comments after this short exposure. 1. The switch is bogus, easily the worst feature on this saw. Someone needs to have a reality check, then return to engineering school.2. The accuracy is acceptable, and in my case should remain so since it stays put in my home shop. (I make this statement not yet having tried any compound miter cuts, such as crown molding, for actual fit and finish.)3. The cut is fairly smooth but I have very limited exposure to other saws and their performance.For me, it's the right saw at this time. For a professional, I'm sure it would be a disappointment..."
2,Freud compound mitre saw broken motor shaft,While sawing a 2x4 stud a knot in wood came out and lodged shearing and twisting motor shaft into. This saw may be ok for small work such as picture frames etc. but would not recommend for heavier work.
4,"jingle bells, batman smells","okay, if you don't know who schuetz is, this is a great introduction to his style. to my knowledge, most of his work is religious, so if you're an athiest/antithiest, you might want to steer clear of his compositions. however, if you are an athiest/antithiest and you're made it this far, you're probably backsliding and looking to listen to some sacred music just for the thrill of betraying your own personal beliefs. if that is the case, then my friend, you are in luck. this is a really enjoyable example of germanic baroque sacred music with no significantly distracting flaws.if you already know schuetz and are looking to expand your library, this is a good addition. there is a collection of his 6-part motets by the emanuel chorus (?) that is positively orgasmic. check it out!"
3,good music,"i remember when i first bought this Cd, back when it first came out, i liked how the cover looked like ru paul was dancing, and i loved the selection of songs on the Cd, i dont know what happened to it, but i was happy to see i here on amazon to buy, so i ordered it, and i got it in the amount of time i was suppose to, and i was a little disapointed, because the plastic cover is just a normal cover, so you cant see rupaul dancing, kind of silly, but it was a cute bonus with the Cd, but i still enjoyed the music on it,"
3,Soapy fun,"OK... its soap. But enjoy the suds and go along for the ride.Similar to Ball's Empire of Sand - epic and grand and silly... but like all those thick and endless sagas scribed in the 60's, it's just fun and a full-bore adventure. As long as you don't expect profound literature and are happy with an engrossing old time read, go for it."
2,LONG LONG LONG,"Ironfire is over 500 pages long and about 100 pages of action. If you like stories that just never get started this is the book for you. It was hard to finish, but I finally got to the end. FINALLY."
1,Published under a different name,This book was published under another name The Sword and the Scimitar and there is no mention of it in the marketing of the book. I don't like authors who do this ....
2,"Malta, Schmalta. Get it right...","This lengthy romancer does for one of history's seminal battles what the movie ""Pearl Harbor"" did for Dec 7th.The action is flat (where it exists) and does not in the least justify the lengthy build up. The period details are good, but the characters are frequently armed with 21st century sensibilities that did not ring true.Some important historical characters are treated shoddily--poor La Valette--and others given only the most cursory glance. For a better and far more exciting read of the topic, check out ""Angels in Iron""."
2,Some readers are easy to please,"After reading Ball's Empires of Sand, which I loved and gave 5 stars, I gave it to my mother, who also loved it. So I bought her a copy of Ironfire, which I also read. I have to say that, although I finished this book, I was shocked that it was so much worse than Empires. The book is more about love lost and found than the battle for Malta - fully three-quarters of the book passes before the battle starts. But when it does, it goes on, and on, and on. Every day the assaults are more horrible than before (or so says the author). How could the Knights Hospitaler and the people of Malta possibly last another day? But they do, and this happens day, after day, after day. It just gets tiresome after a while. And boring. This book is not in the same league as Empires of Sand."
4,Great Book,"A little slow to develop, but unstoppable once it got going. There's some fantastic detail and it's very historically accurate. I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Good read so far,"This book was advertised as Used Good. In the twenty plus years I've gotten books from you, this is the first one not to live up to what it was suppose to be. Used Acceptable might be better if you consider the torn cover, read many times pages and burn spots on the outside sides and a few inside."
4,Birdsong for the New Millenium,"This collection contains almost all of Messien's bird pieces for solo piano. These are fascinating works. Each piece is a portrait of one bird, whose song Messien painstakingly transcribed and translated into his own modal style. In addition to the main birdsong, most of the pieces also include the songs of several other birds found in the same habitat as the main bird portrayed. Add to that, Messien's penchant for using colorful chords to paint in the background of the scene and this is the most visual music written in the 20th century.The performance is quite good. I tend to prefer the Peter Hill recordings which were made in the early 90s and reissued by Naxos as well, but these are quite welcome. At the Naxos price, they are quite a bargain, so even if you find that you don't listen to the entire collection often, you may find yourself coming back to individual pieces over and over again."
2,"Repeat, Repeat, Repeat","All these books pertaining to Starck are basically the same. Just imagine a book on Starck pertaining to his real magic: Hotel / Restaurant Interior's, dovetailed with great photo details. For example a complete overview of his Hotel Designs for Ian Schrager. Theres a book that would give you the same feeling you have when entering one of these hotels, that being; ""You can check out but you can never leave!"""
4,Inspirational,This man is amazing. He's an all around great designer with morals and ethics in today's society. I bought this book as well as 2 other Fay Sweet books. She gets at the heart of the designer's philosophical views and concepts for design.
1,marina raye,I haven't recieve this CD I 'm still waiting on this orderplease let me know what going on ? hope to hear from you soon THANKs
4,csi new york season 2,The stories are like reading the latest copy of true crime and other scary tales.i never want to visit n.y. it has to be a dangerous place to live.
5,No sophomore jinx for the follow-up season,"This CD set continues the successful first season and perhaps is better because the supporting characters have more dimension this time around. Vanessa Ferlito is on board for a few episodes then is dismissed for tampering evidence and replaced by Anna Belknap, a forensic expert from Montana. Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes again do the heavy lifting and work well together and the entire cast is very good. There are six CDs and each has four eposides and 2 through 6 have an added special feature and behind-the-scenes looks. As with the first season, this set has no Spanish sub-titles, which doesn't make sense at all, given the ethnic make-up of New York City."
5,Best Show Ever,"This is the best show ever :) I am so glad I now have all seasons, I have watched every episode more then once and I will keep watching them."
4,C.S.I. New York second Season,"I like all the C.S.I series ( Las Vegas, Miami, New York),and after watching the first season I wanted to know how it goes on now I'm waiting for the next season to come out because I'm hooked on it."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE!!,i was reading some of the reviews of this movie and i have to say that csi ny second season is the worst because i agree with joy joy one of the reviewers on here and he or she is right the first season is so much better they really messed up the second season by putting character development and making ny city less dark. i have to say i am very disappointed with this season and i hope that the third season will be better. I give it a F!!!
4,The best of the three (3) C.S.I. series!!,"Good DVD and some good extras, think season 2 is where this series starts to hit it's stride!!"
4,2nd season....,is only getting better. The actors are getting use to each other and bringing the show together. I didn't like the first season feel to the show because of it being a spin off but it slowly wearing on me. Can't wait to watch the third season.
5,C.S.I. New York - The Complete Second Season,C.S.I. New York - The Complete Second Season by C.S.I.-New York is a great show i give it 5 stars its a new york base show lot of new york this show came after 9/11 and you know whats missing from the city sky line the actors are very good in there rows... i did not know that the nycpd had a great csi unit here in nyc....
1,Bettany Boring as Beige,"This is by far the worst product I have ever seen from PBS. Bettany (your host) spends almost three hours walking around the Greek countryside yammering on about what should be a dynamic and exciting period of ancient history. She may have an armful of credentials but fails to make the subject live. Thank goodness that she was not my first ancient history professor, I would have died a thousand times and missed out on a vital part of human history. Save your money buy something else. Have you ever watched paint dry? This is it."
2,Much better documentaries on the Spartans,"This documentary covered what I had seen in other documentaries without anything really new. The only new thing I really couldn't stand was Bettany Hughes comparing the Spartans to the Nazis. This was so juvenile. It was a cheap sensationalist way to fill her narrative. She did it on more than one occasion. Comparing everything militant to the Nazis is old and out of date. Yes, the Nazis would have liked to imitate the Spartans is many ways, but the two cannot be compared. Please skip the cheap sensationalism when dealing with a very interesting ancient Greek society. There are much better documentares available made by the history channel. Its a shame to have such an otherwise good PBS production be wasted on poor narration."
2,Traveling music from another planetary system.,"Family sing-alongs in the car aren't what they used to be. Sometime during the last century, kids and grownups maintained their sanity (and wakefulness) during long trips with ""BINGO"" and ""99 Bottles of Beer."" Nowadays, apparently, ""Be Kind To Your Web-Footed Friends,"" et al. have been replaced by hit showtunes from ""The Wiz,"" the theme from the original ""Star Trek,"" and selections from ""Brady Bunch"" reruns. Granted, the ""Star Trek"" theme isn't hum-along-friendly, and no one I've ever met has reported singing tunes from ""Doctor Dolittle"" en route to summer camp, but this compilation was put together by Rhino, the famed reissue label. And, surely, Rhino knows what people listen to. So grab this one before it's gone forever, so that the next time the kids beg from the back seat, ""Put on some Judy Garland!"" you'll have just the CD on hand to keep the peace."
3,Needs work,"I bought this stand to use with a Dewalt portable table saw because I don't want to waste my energy lugging equipment to and from the job site from my trailer. I assembled the stand just fine, had to cut a base and screw it to the stand to bring the top of the table up to the proper height so the outfeed bar would work properly, fine. Then I went to stand the saw up in the collapsed mode for transport and noticed that the knob used to adjust the fence was resting on the ground. My plan was to stand the saw up and strap it in place in my trailer for transport. However, the knob would have been banging on the floor of the trailer when in transport. So I can't use it cause it would damage the saw. Can't return it cause I drilled holes in it..."
2,Poor quality control,"Had a lot of sanding to complete, therefore purchased the twin pack. One of the pads did not hold the sandpaper at all. The ""velco"" did not stick, making the pad worthless. The second pad worked much better, but after a short time (30 minutes) a corner started separating from the medal base. Since I still have a lot of sanding left to complete, I need to purchase additional pads to complete the job."
3,Gator Bar Clamp,"The clamp worked for what I needed it to do but it doesn't compare to the name brand clamp of similar design that I own. Under heavy clamping pressure the bar slips, though it does appear to be improving with use."
2,Quality shows in the price,"The product is obviously very cheap compared to the well known brands out there. The quality is reflected in the price. Biggest problem: the swivel pads don't swivel. the construction shows that it is not manufactured with good precision. The plier is not very well aligned. But you get three for less than the price of an Irwin, so no big complaints only if the pads swiveled. The item is heavy, so probably isn't worth the return shipping cost for replacement. I will probably try some adjustments to make it work better."
3,Not John's best,"I LOVE John Mayer, but only liked a few of the songs on this CD. I'd recommend downloading the ones you like from this CD and skipping the majority, Not his best CD that's for sure"
3,Alright,Not his most impressive work. Has some good songs but nothing to write home about. I have probably listen to this CD maybe a handful of times. Not worth the purchase.
5,A thorough study of the tactics of Algerian insurgents,"From the dust cover--On November 1, 1954, the Algerian Revolution erupted suddenly and violently. France, determined to hold her last remaining colony in North Africa, opposed the rebel effort in a bitter struggle that ended with Algeria's independence in 1962. This is a thorough and well-balanced study of the tactics and organization of the Algerian insurgents and the French counterinsurgent forces during the first four years of that struggle. Based on a variety of sources, including little-known unpublished documents and interviews with former French and Algerian soldiers, the book offers valuable material presented for the first time in English...."
2,Size Matters!,"It's a real pretty blade but, unfortuntely, it ain't no 5/32"" thick at the kurf and therefore, doesn't fit in my P/C biscuit joiner (without shimming). I guess my main complaint is that the discription should detail that and doesn't."
3,Pardon our oboes!,"This is a charming and welcome disc in my collection but to the ears of one lucky enough to grow up with the live sounds of the (Szell/Dohnanyi) Cleveland and the Solti-era Chicago orchestra the winds, pardon me, sound rather hard edged and unrefined, especially the ""sour cream and capers"" European oboes. And hey--maybe that's how it really sounded out in the Central European countryside back then. But listening to these joyfully squawking horns and woodwinds (and noting the odd intonation problem here and there) I realize there's a reason why those windy Chicagoans are still considered the finest in the world."
4,Nothing you haven't heard before,This is a pretty good but pretty basic compilation. If you are a Disney fan you probably have all these songs on other cd's. It's a European import therefore a bit expensive. I live in the Netherlands and I bought it for about E7.50 Whitch is about $8.00It's a nice CD to get your Disney music collection started.
2,Sugar Aid not equivalent to Diachrome,"I purchased Sugar Aid as an alternative to Diachrome, chiefly because it was much cheaper--assuming it was roughly equivalent. Upon examination of the actual product, however, I discovered that it has only one-third of the principal ingredient, chromium picolinate, and even less of some secondary components. When taken at the recommended dosage, there is no cost advantage."
4,SanDisk 512MB Cruzer Still Working After Years!,"I've been using this flash drive for over 6 years now and it remains to work fine. For today's standards it's really very small capacity, but I use it to transfer small files, music and pictures/videos I want on my laptop. Transfer rates are acceptable and never an error occurred."
3,OK,When i purchased this product I thought I could use it on windows vista but it will not work. Use it on xp OK
2,Cruzer Micro: plastic snail,"Pros: The design is perfect. Small, very sturdy, nice LED, keychain ring, nice price.Cons: Being an usb2.0, it is nearly unusably slow. Writing lot of small files takes FOREVER, meanwhile you can have your dinner comfortably (half an hour or more!). Average USB 2.0 drives do this about 3-4 times faster. Dealing with large files is better, but also much slower than competition. I absolutely NOT RECOMMEND it if you regularly want to move lot of data in a copy'n'go style."
3,Not exactly fast with small files,"The good points:-Small and fits into just about any USB port you have.-Fast with large files.The Not so good points:-Slow with small files.Recently I put this device to two tests.20.2 MB of data consisting of 1841 files and 291 folders:170 seconds to WRITE the files to the device15 seconds to COPY the files from the device77 seconds to DELETE the files on the deviceHowever, when working with larger files, such as MP3's74.7MB of data consisting of 38 files in 4 folders:18 seconds to WRITE the files9 seconds to COPY the files3 seconds to DELETE the filesAs you can see, when working with much larger files, it is fast. When working with lots of smaller files, it is a dog."
5,SanDisk Cruzer PocketCache Backup Software,"Works great! I was so please with the ease of use that I bought two more similar SanDisk flash drives, with different capacities.There did seem to be one small fluke with the Trial version of the PocketCache backup software. The trial version of the backup software, PocketCache, claims to do incremental backups (i.e. only backs up files that have changed since the previous snapshot backup) but when I tried this the second snapshot backup seemed to take just as long as the first, even though only a few files had been changed. However, the next time I did a snapshot backup indeed it took only a few seconds, as it should, and only added a few KB to the size of the backup file. If this continues to work as it should, it could be a very convenient solution to maintaining current backups of your large and frequently updated folders, such as your My Documents folder."
1,buyer beware!!!,"This seems like a good buy until you go through the checkout and find out they charge more per piece for shipping and handling than the item costs!!! $3.99 for the flash drive $4.00 for the shipping. I can get it cheeper at Office Depot with a teachers card or pay the same at Target,Walmart,Office Depot, Office Max, Staples, etc. SHAME ON YOU!!!"
3,Great Functionality and Size but you will lose the cap,"Works great, but the cap fell off within two weeks and now the case is so loose that it will certainly be lost soon...."
5,People are always jealous of my Cruzer Micro,"...because their thumb drives are so much bigger than mine! It's as fast as I expected, runs just fine on an unpowered USB hub (e.g. keyboard USB ports), and it's so small that it doesn't block other USB ports when it's in use."
5,Easy and Cheap!,"i can't believe the unbelievable prices of flash drives these days. i just bought this one from Wal-mart for $20.00 dollars. that's way cheaper than on amazon.com. plus i've noticed that amazon.com has switched to third retailers and some don't even ship to hawaii, or do ship to hawaii at a hefty price. this switching of amazon having the lowest price to third retailers is really turning me off. possibly even towards purchasing books."
2,"Cheap, small and convenient, but fragile","I purchased the SanDisk Cruzer Micro 512 MB about a month ago, and used it daily. I babied it, keeping it always in my pocket and never dropped it or abused it. Nevertheless, it failed on me this morning. Suggest spending a bit more money for something else that is more reliable, and don't forget to back it up to protect against data loss."
5,SanDisk 512MB flash drive,Compact & economical flash drive makes sharing or transfer of small files easy & convenient. Three choices of skin color plus label on side makes personalization and differentiation with other drives simple. Lavalier for carrying keeps small drive from getting lost.
3,"A good flash drive, but watch out for static electricity",I have used the SanDisk flash drive for quite some time and found this model to be a decent performer in terms of speed. The only problem is damage from static electricity; I have already lost one drive to static discharge.
1,Sadly Disappointing Product,"This is the third portable USB drive that I have purchased. Each purchase was driven by the fact that I constantly needed to upgrade to one with more memory. At first this seems like something that had been well-designed, but within the first use I clearly saw that their product designers/engineers no nothing about what a consumer looks for in this type of product. They were too busy putting the blue light up feature in that they completely ignored everything else. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SANDISK PRODUCT AGAIN.CONS: LID IS LOOSE, COMES WITH AN ADDITIONAL PLASTIC THING THAT HAS NO DESCRIPTION FOR WHAT IT IS FOR, DESIGNED THE KEY LOOP ON THE WRONG END OF THE PRODUCT (My previous Sony had an option to add the key attachment to either end, which is helpful so your keys aren't hanging off your computer), AND WORST OF ALL - THEY MARKET THIS PRODUCT TO BE FAST (HI-SPEED USB 2.0) Well my Sony USB was 2.0 as well and it was 4X's faster! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT."
3,Cap does not stay,"The only major and I think stubid drawback of this stick is that the cap does not fit securly,it is bound to be lost.I think from a company like this more attention should have been given specially that it comes with 2 different caps and non of them stays attached to the device."
2,Does not work in keyboard USB ports,"I like the size, the speed is slow but I can just zip up my files first as the drive has a slow time dealing with lots of small files.The one thing that irks me is that it draws too much power and DOES NOT WORK on the USB port of my Mac ( standard mac keyboard ) or PC ( MS Natural ) I have to plug it into the machine itself. I bought this to move files to and from clients computers and am a little concerned that when I get to the clients office I will not be able to move the files.A friend has a cruzer micro 256, It works on both of my computers keyboard hubs."
2,Watch it... design problems...,"I bought this product after reading some reviews placed around. Even though it proved its utility up to a certain degree, since the beginning we had problems with the design, since it makes it a little uncomfortable to attach to the computers. After a while, some of the computers in my office stopped recognizing it, something that did not happen with other drives of the same maker."
2,What you see isn't exactly what you get....,"The image shown in the description is the older style Micro Cruzer.The older style had rugged lucite sleeving and glowed blue. What Amazon ships now is the newer version with skins and it has a green LED instead of blue. In my opinion, this newer version isn't as well made. Amazon should depict what they actually sell. Consequently, I will be returning mine."
5,A great Item,"Plenty of storage for normal people. Ran through the washer with no problems. Nice, compact size. Two end caps."
5,Survived wash & dry cycle,"I didn't do this on purpose, but I accidentally sent mine through a complete (top-load) wash & dry laundry cycle .. upon discovering this, I let the drive sit for a week to allow any residual moisture to evaporate, and tried it out. My existing files were in perfect condition and the device passes a disk check/error scan with no problems found. I'm really impressed - I was mentally/emotionally prepared for it to be destroyed, but it survived the mistreatment without any detectable problem."
3,Small drive,This is a small drive which is nice. It is narrow enough to plug in two at the same time without having it block adjacent ports. However the write speed seems somewhat slower than some of other brands. It seems especially slow when transferring multiple files in multiple folders - 30 minutes for 50 megs. But it is faster if the files are all zipped together first - about 2-5 minutes.
4,A good buy!,I have been using it for the last 4 months and works great.Its very sleak and compact. Its a good buy and money's worth.
3,I have no idea how to use this - ?,after you put in usb port - then what? Tethank you for your time - grt22@comcast.n
1,Terrible Game!!!!,"This game doesn't even deserve 1*. First,the product desciption says there are 8 lanes,but I only find 2. Also,you can only bowl right-handed. The graphics are good but the sound effects are bad,only here ball rolling and pins falling. This is if the background music is off. I don't like music in a game. The ball seems to roll slowly down the lane. There are no replay functions of camera angle functions. Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling has all these,and is a much beeter game. I beg you not to buy this game!!! I am trying to return mine to the company."
2,Two Thumbs Down,"This game is said to a realistic bowling experiance from home. I dont hink so. The game is slow. The power of the bowler is ungodly weak. Almost as if every ball even a 9 pounder is way too heavy for him or her. The pin action is no where near realistic. The game looks good, sounds good, but just doesnt play good."
4,I hate war but I loved this book!,Yes it sounds oxymoronic but it is so! Sidney Stewart manages to make us share the most awful condtions human beings can be submitted to but never get desperate about a possible change.A lesson of humility and courage.
5,A Great Book Of Faith And Tenacity (Especially Faith),"In this picture of the Bataan Death march, you will see it from a totally unique point of view. The atrocities, pain and suffering remain the same as in all accounts, but the element of faith stands alone as the catalyst for survival. The faith of a Godly priest and the faith of those men around him. Sidney Stewart didn't hate his captors in spite of their brutality. He had faith in God and his fellow man. That faith was laced by a tenacity and will to live that is seldom seen. No matter how many books you have read on this subject, you MUST read this one. it will humble you."
5,Tribute to Human Capacity to Persevere,"This is a classic book pointing up the capacity of humans to persevere in the face of unconscionable deprivation. Sydney Stewart was one of the gallant American soldiers trapped on the Philippine Islands at the outset of World War II. Under-manned, under-armed and under-fed, Stewart and his friends fall into the hands of the conquering Japanese. He survives the Bataan Death March, but his long, arduous odyssey as a prisoner of war is just beginning.Stewart is an eloquent writer and he presents a heart-rending account of his horrific ordeal. That he survived at all is a miracle; that he survived well enough to produced for posterity such a powerful memior is astonishing. Highly recommended."
1,Forgettable Game Board,Game cards were too small for awkward little fingers. Vigorous and lengthy rubbing of the cauldron and back of game cards needed to show the answers to math addition/subtraction took too long to even produce a shadow of the answers. Long and consistent rubbing by little fingers lost the attention of most kids as well as desire to continue playing the game.
5,Great blade - great price,"This is not just a good blade for the price, it is a good blade period! I bought one of these last year to put on my Delta contractor saw. I love the thin kerf design. It makes the blade run with less friction and drag, and my saw has more power left to cut heavy stock. I have used this blade to taper 3"" square, solid oak table legs with no problems. It leaves an extremely smooth surface on the cut. I am convinced that you can do no better than Freud's 10"" blades."
4,Freud Avanti Saw Blades,These are excellent blades at great prices for the everyday enthusiast of wood and thing malleable. I recommend them for every job from plywood to fine hardwoods. The thin kerf marks a precise cut with out wiggle of some other blades. Highly recommend them for both value and usefulness
4,Good workhorse.,Freud has good products made from good materials. Keep it clean and this blade will work hard for you.
2,Lines?,This poster has lines from the crease of the original poster (folded by fours). About $6 dollars so I'm not too disappointed. I just wished that the seller would have added that information to the description of the item.
4,"Classic Brownie, Some Rare","Clifford Brown was amazing from the start, and this set, which includes lots of Paris sessions that may be hard to find, proves it. Even if you have Brown-Roach and other Mercury-Emarcy sessions, these will be well worth it, especially at the price."
4,When you need a little oddity in your life...,"""You Eediot!"", the original soundtrack from Ren & Stimpy, contains songs from the actual show. Everything from the theme song to ""Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy"" and classics like ""Don't Whiz on the Electric Fence"" are on this album. It's wonderful to listen to when you feel the need to be weird or just want a flashback to Nickelodeon's golden days."
3,Oh Missing Joy!,"When Ren & Stimpy came out with this project, I really knew it became unlike anything I've ever whitnessed before. I was a little bit dissapointed with You Eediot!, largely because I was so used to the actual cartoon itself. Well, anyway, this record contains all the tracks base upon the Ren & Stimpy series. Unfortunately, it is just a shame that they don't sell this anymore, for the original fanatics if Ren & Stimpy. Still, I suggest you take a look at their cartoon series, Ren & Stimpy's Adult Party Cartoon. Trust me, you may enjoy it from the heart."
4,A record? You Eediot!,"This CD features songs and instrumentals that were featured inThe Ren & Stimpy Show. The songs are not the same versions that were on the show, they are rerecordings. Unfortunately, show creator (and original voice of Ren) John Kricfalusi did not participate in the album. Multi-talented Billy West does Ren here, as well as Stimpy (who he always did). The songs arguably aren't as good as the versions on the TV show, but they are still pretty amusing. Most fans of the show will probably enjoy this CD."
3,You Eediot,"The quality of the cd and case was excellent. The songs on the other hand were a little less than what I expected. Then again, the studio version of songs can differ greatly from what you hear on the actual show. Most of the music was what I expected. Some of the others were let downs. Overall, ok."
1,uhhhh. . .,"i'm a HUGE fan of R&S, and i've seen every episode ever made, but this is NOT Ren and Stimpy. the songs are all screwed up, and not the way they were on TV. i thought i would barf when i heard the HORRIBLY recorded version of Happy Happy Joy Joy, which is one of my favorite songs, but i hate the way it was in this CD. it sounded like some idiot came and tried to sing it while he was choking on an ice cube! these songs are horrible and they are NOT R&S songs. i hated the songs on this CD because they're nothing at all like the funny TV show. the Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen is ok, but all the other songs are LAME!! if you're a fan of the REAL Ren and Stimpy, don't buy this."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!,I have bought over 400 CDs. This is the ONLY ONE I have ever returned because it was CRAP. These songs are not the versions from the show. They have been re-recorded and have none of the energy or humour of the originals. BUYER BEWARE. This album sounds like a (bad) lounge jazz band urinating all over great songs. If you buy this you will be very disapointed (Or maybe just a blissfully ignorant moron who can't tell the difference)BTW.. WHEN IS THIS SHOW COMING OUT ON DVD!!!??!?!???!?!????!
5,Book of Mormon Lands,"There are a lot of theories floating out there on where the Book of Mormon Lands are. This film contains some pretty convincing details that illuminate the subject. Considering all the facts Dr. Ainsworth presents, he makes a very effective case for Mesoamerica. It casts some doubt on what we have known up until now. Either way- it is very thought provoking and worth watching. Minus the whip and fedora, makes you feel a little Indiana-Jones."
5,Intriguing,This film presents some very intriguing evidence about the Book of Mormon lands. I've always wondered why the Book of Mormon itself doesn't focus on a cold climate and I learned some amazing things by watching this movie. I was especially intrigued by the underwater evidence.
5,"LOVE THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS, NEED MORE!!","been listening to the smothers brothers since childhood, but i cant find anything but this cd. if you know where to find more.....holdem@westriv.com."
5,The Smothers Brothers: Everlasting Joy and Humor,"We need more! The Smothers Brothers will live on forever in the funny bones of anyone who remembers their own sibling rivalries. A unique blend of opposing viewpoints, memories and childlike jealousy. Mediocre Fred is a soft gentle ballad with a blindside blitz. Like everything else they do, their tempo and timimg are perfect."
5,A Great Trip Down Memory Lane,"I love this CD which includes so much of the funny stuff the Smothers Brothers did way back when. I loved them then, and it's still funny now."
4,Great price for a substantial dose of the folk comedy duo...,"Let's face it, folk singing is not as popular as it used to be, and comics have gotten a lot more profane and risque than they used to be. So, more than an hour's worth of the Smothers Brothers, who were TV trail blazers with their own network variety show, can have some dated moments. But Tom and Dick were actually good singers and pickers and good comic writers and performers, and this product shows them off well. There are a lot of laughs here, and it holds up for two or three repeat plays before one can remember most of the punchlines. It's a bargain if you are old enough to remember them when they were a hot act, and a worthy introduction if you like the folk sound and clean comedy."
4,Sibling Revelry,"The name of this great album is, in fact, Sibling Revelry, not rivalry. This album is a great introduction to the Smothers Brothers and does not require a knowledge of folk music or much of anything else, really, to enjoy. Fairly clean and squeaky clean by today's standards."
4,Sibling Revelry: The Best of the Smothers Brothers,A delightful collection of song and humor that brings back many found memories of my youth.
3,Great act- bad sound,"I was so excited to get this CD because The Smothers Brothers really are a genius act but the sound quality of the CD was not great, in some of the songs it sounds like only one of the brothers was miked so you can hear one but barely the other. I've tried re-adjusting the quality and it helped a bit but not enough to really get the best benefit."
5,An Incredible Stroll Down Memory Lane...,"As soon as I got this CD I popped it into my stereo just to hear the resounding tunes of ""I fell into a vat of chocolate..."" I burst into giggles immediately, reminiscing of the time when I was six years old and popped my Dad's scratchy Smother's Brothers record onto the turntable night after night. I even bought him a copy too. The CD rendition is excellent. If you ever loved the Smother's Brothers back in their heydey, or were the daughter of a big Smother's Brothers fan, as I was, this is for you!"
1,Hard drive failed in 5 days...,"Gave this to my kid (15) for Xmas, and his hard drive failed on December 31st. And no, he wasn't jogging with it, and did not drop it...."
1,don't buy this!,"the software needed to post music from computer to the player is too complex, and transfers - when they are successful - are very slow. Every few songs I got an error and player wasn't recognized anymore by the software. Nothing a few ""unplug/replug"" cycles couldn't fix. Every few ""unplug/replug"" cycles the software was nice enough to shut itself down for me and I got to start all over again. After about 5 such software restarts (I had transferred all of about 30 titles, with a few thousand more to go), I realized what a piece of junk this really is and promptly returned it. Got a more expensive ipod and it works great. Buyer beware: you get what you pay for."
4,Im Lovin'It!,I love my player...! Before I bought this item I knew what a Harddisk based mp3 player was like. I bought myself a Toshiba Mobilphile (5 gig.) in may '03. Unfortunately this player was stolen in Paris. After this I knew I wanted an harddisk based mp3 player again. After I read some reviews I decided to buy this one... and I'm lovin' it!Sound quality is great!Software is really easy to use.I like the big (20 gig.) storage!cons: It's not as small as ipod.
2,Wait till Creative figures out problems with software,"Good player, but may be difficult for you to actually get it to connect to your computer. For what ever reason, the software simply refuses to install the correct driver onto my computer. I installed succesfully on my old second computer but with USB 1.0. With 1.0, it took all night to download my songs but it worked and I was happy. Now, a new problem, with USB 1.0, I am no longer able to download more music onto the player. When you connect the player, the software tries to catalog the players slongs and apparently, it takes too long to catalog the 15 GB of songs over a USB 1.0 connection and the software automatically shuts itself off after 1 minute and gives an error.Also, if you have any problems with this player, good luck trying to actually contact customer service. After 3 weeks of trying, I have recieved no reply.Make sure you buy this product with a service play, the 90 day warranty Creative offers is a joke."
2,not very reliable,"i got one three weeks ago.. It freezes sometimes and i have to reset it. Yesterday i download the new firmware online. after installed it, the player freezes at the logo everytime i turn it on, and i have to turn it off by removing the battery. I am gonna return it tommorrow.. i got it from circuity city not from amazon"
2,Not a fan of harddrive based players,I've had a couple of nomads and they've all diedon me. The last one was the NX. It only lasteda couple of days and croaked.
1,"Poor Support, Don't Waste your Time","We purchased the Nomad Zen DAP at Christmas 2003, by May of this year it's hard drive needs to be replaced. It only comes with a 90 day warranty, so we have to shell out $108.00 to get it repaired. Creative must really stand by their workmanship if they will only warrant their products for 90 days. You would be better off with a iPOD or Archos 6000. I have one each of those for years and they still function well full of music. Creative should hide their heads, and their products. What a waste of money !!"
5,Zen NX - Doesn't get any better than this!,"Think positive! Software for this or any other gadget that is capapble of doing what this item is capapble of can be challenging as can be the controls on the NX, but a little patience is so-o-o rewarding.One should keep in mind what we spent our money for - SOUND; that's been Creative's business from the git-go and the fact they're able to do it at these prices makes for a hands down winner. Another point to consider is 20 vs 30 gigs: 20 gigs of MP3 tracks is virtually impossible to keep track of - 30 is absolute chaos. However, take your pick - the sounds's the same - GREAT!"
5,Five years and counting....,"Don't know what all the negative reviews are about. I've had my Nomad mp3 player for five years now, and it's NEVER quit on me. I've never had a problem with it, period.I love the fact that I can plug it into my computer and transfer song files, create playlists, and fix it up just for my use. Since it's got a huge memory, I use it as a backup for the songs on my computer's hard drive, just in case the computer conks, which it has! Got a new computer, and since I had all my songs on the Nomad, I just did a quick transfer, and voila!I wouldn't give up my Nomad for an Ipod ever."
4,A practical up to date handbook,"This book is very practical for the typical american collector, cars are easy to find (if you know the exact model), it has all the models that have been produced (American cars)until 1990. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it could have more pictures, and it could also include more European cars, because many are missing like Renault, Fiat, etc. For the price, I still think its a good buy and and could come in handy."
2,No added value,"I have bought this book hoping to find some tools to improve my memory. Instead I had to listen to two hours of a monotonous drill on one basic idea - that remembering is better if there is an association with a movement, picture, colour, feeling, etc. in our brain. Although true, that idea is not even original. You can find it in books by Tony Buzan published more than 20 years earlier!The title of the book almost makes me lough - Advanced Mega Memory! A nicely packaged junk food. If you are really interested in improving your memory, in how the brain works and in learning how to use it, then I can highly recommend books by the above mentioned Tony Buzan - Use Both Sides Of Your Brain and Speed Reading."
3,I don't know if I liked this or hated it!,I purchased the 2 cassette version knowing full well that it is much lighter than the 9 cassette version also available. I figured it was worth the dead presidents to find out if this method is worthwhile or not. I'm considering buying the complete version but the 2 tape version didn't send me running to Amazon to order the full set. The prices have dropped considerably and they are now available at the Amazon zShop.http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/exchange-glance/Y02Y2148373Y9876462/qid=946397475/sr=1-5/002-0769272-9212215I may buy it to explore a little more. If I don't like it I'll sell it on eBay!
5,stained-glass essays,"This book is both evocative and provocative. The author manages to fuse a poetic sensibility with a rigorous examination of Catholic theology and seasonal observances. The essays will be of interest not just to Catholics, but to anyone who is interested in theology and wrestling with matters of faith. It's a nourishing sort of book, very well-written in an intelligent and lyrical style."
4,Fun twists on old ideas,I really liked the way he took the old fantasy races we've been seeing for years in a lot of fantasy books and made them a little more unique and original. When I first saw what he did with elves I was just digging it from there on out.I love elves and always had a way I thought they should be in my head but now I think I'll always think of them as he had them in his book. Not to mention what he did with the other races to some degree and even humans.Just a real fun read all the way around.
2,"Good story line, very distracting lack of editing.","While I enjoy the story line the unbelievable lack of proof reading of this book and the next book will probably keep me from buying book three in the series. On seemingly every page I found run-on sentences, incorrect punctuation, or extra words. It becomes very distracting and I've found myself searching for the next screw up instead of trying to enjoy the story. I don't know if Mr. Corrie is proofing his own books or what but whoever is should be fired."
5,A riveting action/adventure fantasy novel of three mercenaries and a young knight who unexpectedly joined together in a quest,"Seer's Quest by Chad Corrie is an entertaining introduction to the world of Tralodren. This is the remarkable story of Dugan (an the escaped gladiator), Vinder the dwarven ax, Cadrissa the young mage, and a blind elven seer with his assistant. Depicting the tale of this diverse group's journey to Takta Lu Lama for the purpose of retrieving information lost for over a thousand years, Seer's Quest is a riveting action/adventure fantasy novel of three mercenaries and a young knight who unexpectedly joined together in a quest, even though they are all entirely distrustful of one-another, and the elven seer foretells of an even grander endeavor of which they might all engage. The first volume in the ""Divine Gambit"" trilogy, Seer's Quest is very highly recommended for all ""sword & sorcery"" fantasy buffs for its remarkable detailing of a highly intricate world filled with adventure."
5,ONe of Ernest Holme's best,"This is one of my favourite Ernest Holmes books besides ""This Thing Called You"" and ""Living The Science Of Mind"".It is considerably thinner book compared to the 'Science Of Mind', and it is concise, easy to understand, and it drives home the solutions to your everyday challenges. On the left pages are the Challenges or 'problems' people face, and the right page will show you the solution- how to adjust your attitude and mind to respond to such a challenge, and bring results.it is amazing how such a thin book can be so inspiring. THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS BOOK. No rituals, no dogma. Only wisdoms of the ages that works.Ernest Holmes' philosophy are derived from Christian and Eastern (ancient Hindu, Taoist, etc) thought. His view on religion is wise, a deeply spiritual man. In fact, unlike most religious/wpiritual writers, he is one of the very few authors that can talk about religion and philosophy without any dogma, rituals, nor bias against any other religion/philosophy."
1,don't recommend,"I am going to return this book, it doesn't worth anything,I don't want it even for free."
4,4th Graders Should See It!,"Fun for fourth grade classes that have already read the book, By the Great Horn Spoon. Lots to 'compare & contrast.' Quite different from the book, but similarities exist, too. Your class will love it!"
4,good classic disney movie,This movie is about as classic as Disney gets!Great! An old movie you can sit down with the kids to watch and not need to mute or edit because of content.I recommend this to others.
4,cute Disney western comedy - in WIDESCREEN,"THE ADVENTURES OF BULLWHIP GRIFFIN, a western comedy-rouser from Disney, gets it's long awaited DVD debut. Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette and Karl Malden (all veterans of Disney live action films) lead the impressive cast.McDowall plays a meek butler from Boston, suddenly landed in the wild wild west, in the thick of the gold rush. Romance, adventure and comedy abound with Suzanne Pleshette an eyeful as saloon cutie Arabella Flagg. The cast also includes Harry Guardino, Richard Haydn, Hermione Baddeley, Cecil Kellaway and Joby Baker.Disney has released THE ADVENTURES OF BULLWHIP GRIFFIN in pleasing 16:9 anamorphic. With the company in the bad habit of releasing most of their back-catalogue titles in fullscreen, this is rather a surprise. Sadly no extras, though having BULLWHIP GRIFFIN finally in digital format has been worth the wait."
2,Disc stopped working,"I purchased this DVD in 2005. I've watched this DVD with my students after readingBy the Great Horn Spoon!by Sid Fleischman every year, except this year. The disc simply does not work any more. I would've given it 4 or 5 stars; however, the disc won't play on any DVD player or computer. I'm so disappointed."
1,Is this the movie I remember from my youth???,"When I was a boy, I remember rolling in the aisle laughing at some of the scenes. There are even lines I have quoted for the last 45 years. Alas, the memories of youth DO NOT always stand the test of time.Some scenes were just as I remember but, overall, this was a rather poor movie. This is an example of some of the mediocre Disney ""comedies"" produced at the time. I did not remember the face color overs that were superinposed to depict emontions. Way too much of what made the Bad 60's comedies BAD! I wish now that I had left my childhood rememberance of this movie intact and had never seen it again. Unless you are an absolute die hard of all things Disney or a collector for the sake of collecting, do YOURSELF a favor and keep those rose colored glasses on and pass this one by."
1,Disappointing. Nothing like the original book.,"If you are a Sid Fleishman fan, you will hate this movie. All the wonderful lines from Fleishman's original ""By the Great Horn Spoon"" are gone. Many of the best characters are gone. The plot has been Disneyfied to the point where Fleishman's original is unrecognizable. This silly film isn't worth watching once, let alone owning."
2,Wasn't what I expected,The selection of cross stitch was definately not what I had expected. When I read the title I assumed there would be a selection of cross stitch charts to choose from but there is only 1 for wedding and 1 for anniversary. The charts are hard to read due to no color used in the codes and it is printed very lightly and on small graphs. I wasn't impressed with the selection of stitchery. My vote is to look elsewhere if you are looking for anniversary/wedding stitchery.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD because of the first track, ""Blue Dancer"" which I heard on GoRadio.THIS IS NOT THE SAME SONG! It definitely _not_ the same arrangement as GoRadio is webcasting, and as far as I can tell it isn't even the same melody!The rest of the CD is typical elevator-music new age."
4,Only used it on a small tractor tire,"I have only used this to seal a puncture on a small lawn tractor tire, but it worked quite well. I also have a bottle in my car (Mini Cooper with no spare) but have never had to use it and hope I don't."
3,Sanding Pad,"My Fein Multimaster is a wonderful tool. I wouldn't trade it for anything. Having said that, the sanding pad (with loops) wears out fairly quickly and like many of the Fein accessory attachments, it's much too expensive. In fact, I usually purchase Fein's sandpaper, but if I have to use a large quantity, I sometimes purchase other paper and cut to fit the sanding pad."
1,Item not as described,"The item I received was not as described in the item description. The product description said it has an aluminum backing like the ones I have purchased in the past, however the ones I received were plastic backed"
3,Not above 4,Yes my sanding pad melted in less than 5 min also. I tried to remove the s.paper and the Velcro.came off with it. Fein recommends you don't sand with the speed setting above 4. To much heat is genarated and the pad dosnt hold up well. I think the settIng was 6 when initially burned first pad not knowing feins sanding speed recommendations I now just use the fein for cutting and my Milwaukee multitool for sanding.
2,It needs better design,The velcrow pad overheats on the corners and outer edges. This process allows for rapid decay of the remainder of the pad.The sand paper backing is to often of poor quality also.
4,Fein multimaster sanding shoe / pad,"This is the factory replacement for the sanding pad on the Fein Multimaster Q Edition. For speed and efficiency of sanding, most users probably use the highest speed setting. And doing that will melt the edges of the pad and it's velcro surface. As good as this tool is, it certainly has its limitations, and this is one of them."
2,Fein can do better,"I have a fein mutimaster that is 15 years old and for certain jobs cant be beat but the pad is really pathetic.I just purchased some new pads,installed it,installed coarse grit sandpaper to avoid the dreaded heat build up and used it roughly 30 seconds then went to switch grits and as I was pulling the sandpaper off it pulled the velcro off along with the sandpaper.COME ON FEIN!!!!!!!!!"
1,Fein H/L pad is a very poor product,"As others have said here, these pads are P*ss poor. With all the negative reports, you'd think Fein would get a clue.The sander itself is excellent and some of the other accessories are top notch. But I sure wish they would beef up this H/L padI'd like to know if other brands of pads are just as bad."
1,Useless idiots are we all?,"As someone who attended the rally in DC on 9-12-2009 and as someone who is quite tired of the propaganda thrown around by the establishment in Govt, it doesn't surprise me how the mantra of astro turf gets thrown around like ""projection"" onto the truly grassroots uprising of individuals when the actual manufactured movement called Occupy Wall Street is described in the media as some spontanious movement.History will be told by the victors. Let us hope sanity and reason prevail."
5,Best Costume Ever!,"I bought this costume for my daughter and one of her friends when she was in Kindergarten, which was 6 years ago. I intentionally bought it bigger than she needed, so she could wear it longer... which turned out to be until she was in 4th grade. The costume held up through a bunch of birthday parties, Halloween parties, Pirate parties, and dress up sessions. It has held up amazingly well and has been a favorite! Well worth the money!"
3,Decent budget pirate costume...,One warning they seem to be cut a bit large for the T sizes so take that into account. I liked my adult size version and they are packed up for next years' swashbuckling fun.
3,Nice product-poor documentation,"Unfortunately I had to return it as it did not work with the Ridgid T2424 tablesaw. The arbor bolt is too short and housing interferes with 3 small bolts on the outside dado blade (opposite of dial blade). Talking with the Freud representatives, it doesn't sound like it works with Craftsman either but you should double-check to be sure before buying like I did. Duh!Documentation is unclear and inaccurate. Luckily there is an 800 number and person I talked to was friendly. Dado blade didn't work on his tablesaw either! Make sure you have a good tablesaw... ha ha."
5,"Very smooth, very accurate","I was most impressed with the performance of the dado. The botom was very smooth andthe adjustment for width very accurate. The priuce from AmaZon was also the best. Very pleasedNearly 4 years later (Feb 2013) the dado set has been used frequently and still holds a fine cut edge and is still accurate, easy to adjust."
5,Oh! Why does it have to end?,"I hated to see this series end, and Stephen King will not writeanother series? I think he should seriously reconsider! Thiswas not a completely typical King ending. I was emotionallycaught off guard. I did not know that I would need kleenex.Yes, I cried. Coffey did not deserve to die. Billy the Kidhad an ending that was rightly deserved. I also believe Mr. Jingle'sshowing back up was a sign for Paul to get the memories outof his system. Everything has come full circle for Paul, nowhe can live the rest of his life in peace."
4,coffey on the mile,"This book was definitly a thrill. I didn't read the first five but this book was interesting. It was about an innocent african-amerian who was acused of raping and murdering two girls. He in fact, was innocent and got helped out by a guard at the penetentiary. I will leave the ending up to you. I do recommend this book to anyone who is interested in suspense and thrill. It is fairly easy."
4,A good book.,"Coffey on the Mile is the last in a series of six books entitled ""The Green Mile"". The green mile spoken of refers to the ""mile"" an inmate has to walk before coming to the electric chair. In this particular book, the guards that keep an eye on Coffey have come to the conclusion that he did not kill the little girls he was accused of killing. The guards wanted to not see Coffey escape the prison because Coffey has a power that none of them have ever seen before and he uses this power to heal a friend of one of the guards. The guards conclude that this man could never hurt anyone and try to get him to leave but Coffey says that he doesn't want to leave. He would rather die then to live in a world with so much suffering"
4,The Green mile,"So far I'm about 2/3 of the book and I'm loving every single moment of it. How Stephen King grabs your attention. It about an African-American convicted of rape and murder of two young girls. People are convicnce that he murdered them looking by the size of him. He big as a giant and has the mind of a child. He is sent to a Penitentiary where he about to be executed when a prison guard believe he is an innocent man. He believe the convicted man is innocent, so he investigate his files and starting questioning people about the murder. And the only way he could be free is by the prison Guards. I would recommend this book because talk about the struggle between life or death and how mysteries get involves trying to solve the case."
3,A little disappointed,"These are pretty pink cards with care bear images on the back. However, on the front only the face cards have care bear images, the numbered cards are plain except the numbers. We tried to play war but my niece only wanted the face cards because they had care bears on them. Needless to say I lost! Would have been nice if they had pictures on all of them. Otherwise the seem well made and cute."
2,Naked Passions,Unfortunately I just dislike movies where actresses have silicone augmented breasts. It is sad in our cultur the Playboy/Hefner effect is so pervazive.
2,Denies inerrancy of scripture,"While this book has nice pictures and very interesting contextual information I would not recommend it to parents who teach their children that the Bible is God's inerrant word. It consistently conveys a skeptical approach to the Bible and conveys no particular interest in or respect for the God of the Bible.In a caption it says of Herod's slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem ""In reality the story is a myth."" Well generally speaking massacres don't have a high rate of official documentation - it just doesn't make for good PR. I guess a good political hush job makes this event merely a myth if the only surviving record source is the Bible (a very good document by any standard). While this fits the academic definition of ""myth"" the clear implication is that the event did not occur.The book also makes other declarative statements and explanations that I have never read in reputable Christian sources."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"This book has power, experience and such greatness. It shows you things about the Bible that I never even knew could even exist. Like the pillar of salt/rock that Lot's wife was turned into because she looked back. Wow. You have to read this book. The Bible put things in persceptive in those times. But seeing them as they are today, is like WOW. Read this book over and over again. I know I will."
4,fake africans - bot good!,"But in reality, the Daktaris were Brooklyn-based studio musicians, many of them white, many of whom had already been assembled by Desco heads Gabriel Roth and Phillipe Lehman as the label's house band, the Soul Providers. Besieged by inquiries about the music's origins and demand for a Daktaris tour, Roth and Lehman soon acknowledged the hoax, but given the quality of the album, the backlash wasn't enormously great. There was no follow-up to the Daktaris' initial session, but some of the members formed a new Afro-beat revivalist group called Antibalas in the spring of 1998. ~ Steve Huey, All Music Guide"
4,Can you do the Daktari Walk?,"If you are into Fela Kuti/The JBs(68-75) you can stop reading, and start smiling, because this is so close to the afrofunk of Fela that it`s impossible not to dig it. Yes, it may be a hustle, but it`s done with conviction and style, and you will find enough funk and afrobeat on this album to fill your socks."
5,Staggeringly funky,"Unbelievably good. Easily one of the best African albums I've ever heard. Deeply funky--like James Brown, yet more rhythmic and complex. Joyous, heart pounding fun."
3,About what I expected,"I'm a tool connoisseur in that I like to over-buy my tools. I change spark plugs, belts, brakes, an occasional alternator or battery, etc. For what I do, these are FINE. I would compare the feel, fit and finish to something you would buy at a auto parts chain like CSK or Autozone. The locking mechanism functions but is hardly as sleek as even a craftsman. There is also noticeable looseness at the joints. If you're a frequent home mechanic, spring for something nicer. If you're a monthly mechanic like me, go for it.Of interest; this exact set is at Sears for almost twice the price."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this cake stand. I do enjoy it for the fact that it is large enough to hold a 10-12"" cake and tall enough to cover a multiple layered cake. I like that it is lightweight in both the stand and the lid. But I have noticed that the lid already has developed a crack in it and I have not used it that much and only handwash it. Also, the stand comes in three pieces and you have to screw it together. If you aren't careful you could easily strip the nut and bolt that comes with it when you are trying to tighten it down to keep it from wobbling. Also, because it comes in three pieces there is a screw that goes through the stand that your cake sits on. It sticks up a bit and so food gets stuck around it. I tend to use it only as a display stand and put a plate on top of the stand so I can avoid food getting stuck in the screw. I wish this could have been designed a little bit better."
2,ARGH! Missing the lid!!!!!,"THe bottom is fine, that came in time for my New Years Eve party...BUT the TOP??? MIA from package. So, I did exactly as told and contacted Amazon customer service who were unable to help me very much. They said the lid was not sold separately. I'd have to return to re-place entire item which did not help my needs at all. I did find a replacemenmt lid and wound up buying that and expediting s & h just to have the dome prior to the party. Customer Service paid for the s & h for that part but the fact that it did not come in the box to begin with I have to give it a very poor rating!!!!"
5,"Very ""Retro""! Perfect for the display of your baked items!","This is such a nice product! I have an old house, and it just matches the style of my kitchen.It gives the ""glamor"" look of the glass/crystal cake stands.... but, it is light, and unbreakable. It is easy to transport this, and you do not need to worry about chips, or breakage.The glass cake stand tops can be so heavy , and difficult to lift. This cake stand is very easy for all to use.The price is very reasonable, and the quality is very good.I recommend this item most highly!"
4,Singularly creative voice,"Jon Deak's work has great range within his auto-idiomatic style - and this CD is a good way to become familiar with his sound. The performances are all excellent, and in particular, the one-man show of Richard Hartshorne in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' on contrabass and as all the spoken characters is very winning - and the contrast of the charmingly innocent (yet tongue-in-cheek) 'Eeyore Has A Birthday' with the sophisticated material of 'Lady Chatterly's Dream' demonstrates Deak's mastery of combining the spoken word with an always-accessible yet provocative personal compositional style."
2,Poorly manufactured,This item was a disapointment. Looks great in the picture but is cheaply made. Peices of the wicker were coming loose. The item is also very short. I am 5ft 10 and my feet stick off the end by a couple of inches. I guess you get what you pay for. If you spend $800-$1000 you will get much better construction and at the end of the day will last longer than this.
3,Nice Piece for the Price,"Unlike my negative review for the sectional under this line, I like this Sun Lounger. I bought three of them. It is modern looking and the wood arms are very stylish. I do think that if you keep this lounger out in the sun and rain all the time, it wouldn't last you three months. However, I keep mine under a patio and take them out when needed and that keeps them looking nice. I gave these loungers three stars because I think durability wise, they may not be the ""all-wheater"" loungers they are advertised to be."
2,Bad Rack,I purchased this rack and had enormous trouble puling the sides apart to get it open. I had two big men and they struggled as well. the rack was made well; it just was simple way too hard to pull apart and put together.
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"The rack arrived in a box that looked like it had been driven over by a truck, several times. Rack was actually hanging out of what was left of the box. Not a scratch on it. No damage whatsoever. Very simple to set up. Works like a charm. I wish I had bought two of these instead of one of another model. Highly recommended, you can't go wrong with this one, despite it arriving with no instructions of any kind."
4,Super sturdy,"I bought a garment rack at a local hardware store and the caster broke on the first use. This is a replacement and it is super sturdy. It is easy to assemble, once you figure out that you have to remove the upright extensions in order to ""unfold"" the rack. I expect that this rack will be in use for many years."
5,Good Product,We purchased this garment rack for a bedroom without a closet and found it a great solution. It is sturdy and holds many garments. The price was right as well.
5,Sturdy Rack,"Finally a cloths rack that is sturdy and won't fall apart like the Big Store clothes racks. Easy to put together, and will hold a substantial amount of clothing on both rails. Good for hanging trousers and street length dresses, but not long gowns. Very pleased with this product."
