3,New?,While item was sold as new when I received it had been resealed. There was no effort made to repackage. The plastic for manuals and item itself were just left on top of box when you opened it. I have not hooked up yet and hope item works.
1,Worst. Interface. Ever.,"Does not work with iPhone or Touch, as many have noted.Used with the iPod models it DOES work with, you will encounter one of the worst user interfaces in the history of consumer electronics. Absolutely no sorting or organization features for music of any kind - no folders, no playlists, no sorting by artist or album. You get an alphabetical list of tracks on your device. Just start with ""A"" and, if you have more than 20 songs on your iPod, settle in for a few hours of scrolling through song titles to get to anything that starts with ""The."""
2,Should have just gotten a cd changer,I thought it would be a good idea to be able to run a wire to my glove compartment leave my old ipod video in there then who ever was in my passenger seat could change the song. However there is no way of setting it so you can use the ipod interface much easier to just plug my iPhone into the front.Comes with a lot of unnecessary wiring too. takes up alot of room. really hard to fit between my bluetooth adapter and my cigarette lighter since that was the only place it could go.
2,Not happy with it.,"Non-intuitive navigation. You have to start at ""A"" every time you select from top level play list or ""artist"", ""Album"" , ""Genre"" etc.Also after finally find what album/artist you wish to play and start to preview the tracks; All the sudden the word ""stop"" comes up on the LCD display and you can not go anywhere, no previous,next track etc can be accessed anymore. Then you have to start all the way from the top and go through all the A's,B's,C's and so on. It is a pain in the butt!If your head unit accepts AUX input via 1/8, connect your Ipod that way. You will be able to navigate much faster that way and avoid the stupid ""stop"" message.I gave it two stars because it does actually interface with the I-pod to some degree. That where it stops."
1,"Worse, Purchase","I don't like this product and also the company I purchase this from will never take back right after I send then 2email, one before I purchase this item, and the other after they send it, I will never used Amazon to purchase anything else, or partner, Worse company I have done use"
1,Adaptador de ipod para jvc,"Me parece que el adapatador para el ipod es muy malo ya que la forma como controlas el ipod con el reproductor es demasiado incomodo, ya que yo he tenido otras pantallas que manejan ipod y esta es la peor, aunque el repro en si no es malo"
5,"seaQuest, it holds ur wonder, even as a music score!","I had to get a second CD because I lost/ damaged my first. The first one cost me $20, ad I was fully prepared to pay that again... The music is the best part of any series. If you don't believe me, get a copy of ST:DS9, Behind the scenes... they show what the ep. sounds like without the music score."
5,A Must Have,"If you are a fan of the TV series, you must have this CD. Get it now before it goes out of print."
3,Great CD for fans of the show,"Shame the Main Title is not longer as the other tracks, while nice, are nothing spectacular. Would have also been good if they did a best of CD containing the best music from all the seasons of the show because this CD only contains the music from a few episodes.Still, this CD is better than nothing and I'm glad to have it."
4,Great EP,"This is their debut EP and is pretty good. The first song, ""Telescope"" is probably their oldest song judging from the style of it to their current style, but it isn't bad, semi-heavy. The 2nd song is ""Sea Knows When."" This is BY FAR the best song on the album, with a catchy melody and great vocals. The 3rd song is ""Everybody Lies,"" a slower song that isn't one of their better songs in my opinion. The 4th song is ""Treehouse,"" which is the original version of the rerecorded single on their 2nd album Hi-Low. This version has more snare drum and some differnt guitar effects and isn't quite as good as the rerecorded version, but good nonetheless. The last song is called ""Nothing"" and is the heaviest one on the album. It has some distortion at the beggining and isn't really too catchy, but not terrible. Anyhow, buy this album if you are a Nada Surf fan."
5,An absorbing biography!,"As a Secondary Social Studies Teacher, I am impressed with the easy writing style of H.W. Brands. He has taken the complex life of a com- plex man and created an interesting and absorbing chronicle of Roosevelt's life - a must book for any true student of history!Steve Schockow, Rochester, NY"
5,TR sits comfortably in the sitting room,"Extensively researched and absorbing to read. Theodore Roosevelt was one of the greats and eloquently portrayed in this excellent and revealing book by Brands. I learned much about the human being as apposed to the personal persona of TR. Although not in the same category as Richard Patton's astounding ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"", Brands biography does a very creditable job of placing TR in our sitting room. So if you want to know the human being with all his foibles,""The Last Romantic"" is definitely for you. Highly recommended."
5,Bully Bully,"From page 1 to page 800, this book was a treat to read. Everything you ever wanted to know about T.R., it's in this book. In fact, the book was so much fun, i found myself in Oyster Bay, visiting Sagamore Hill after I finished the book. I took the tour of the man's house and it seemed like I had been there before. Thanks sir for writing a great book. It was certainly better than Edmund ""Fiction"" Morris' account. Also, this book was fair. If you are looking for a complete Pro-Teddy or anti-Teddy account, this isn't the book for you. Kudos!"
5,WOW,"Wow...TR: The Last Romantic is insightful, inspiring, educational and fun! A head-on collision with history, politics, government, diplomacy, leadership, biology, American culture, masculinity and more, as T.R. comes brilliantly to life. 900 pages of sheer delight! I only wish there had been more - I intend to read it again!"
1,Not for fans of TR,"As an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, I was very disappointed in Mr. Brands' book. It appeared to me that Mr. Brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic's point of view. While any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man, Mr. Brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of TR's actions. TR was by no means a perfect man, however, history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents. One gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of TR that Mr. Brands'truly disliked his subject."
4,Vintage Williams,"Although the best of this score is performed as a symphonic suite elsewhere, this CD is still a worthwhile listening experience despite the sound quality lacking the dynamics of today's technology. Williams trademark style is evident throughout - big emotional themes, in suitable Americana flavour (nodding to Aaron Copland.)One motif in particular is a ghost of Williams future ""Superman The Movie"" track ""Leaving Home"", with its wide harmonies and lush instrumentation. Williams also makes use of a menacing harmonica and the occasional bass guitar. This is a work produced during John William's golden period, expressive and inventive."
4,"Some Great Early Williams, just Not Enough of It","The big draw of this disc is the main theme from the score, which reappears now and then in variations. It's vibrant, alive and stirring, and has deservedly become a pops and band staple ever since. It is nice to hear it in various guises on this disc, though I agree with at least one other reviewer that the tracks are agonizingly short, with 13 of the 17 coming in at under two minutes -- and of course, that means that the entire release is frustratingly short. So it's kind of a question of what you're looking for: If it's the main theme you want, you might consider looking into other albums that have it as a track. Not that the rest of the music isn't worthwhile -- one just wishes there were more of it, in bigger chunks."
3,"A great score, a not-so-great recording","Merrily We Roll Along has a fantastic score, consistently up to Sondheim's usual sstandard of excellence. (As for the show- well, the show will probably never be any good, no matter how often the book is revised.) This recording, however, is not as good as it could have been. Slick is probably the best word for it; there is a synthesized sheen on every track. Also, some of the voices in the supporting cast are rather annoying- too strident and nasal. The principals are mostly good, however. The orchestrations lean WAY too heavily on keyboards for my liking, but sometimes thats how it has to be done, I suppose. Anyway, the merits of the score far outweigh the drawbacks of this CD."
1,Mary's voice is painful,"Like many others have said, this score is superb, but this cast does a foul job of it. Most voices maintain tolerable, but the actress who plays Mary brings tears of pain to the eyes of the listener. Perhaps she was trying to make her character more brazen; if so, she failed miserably. If you are to come across the actress who played Mary, please do the world a service, and rip out her larynx."
3,"Great score, but buy the 1981 recording.","Like most Sondheim fanatics I have a soft spot in my heart for this, his most spectacular flop. However, I feel that the 1981 RCA recording, although technically inferior has a much greater depth of emotion. This version has always sounded far to slick to me, and although I own it, I play it perhaps one time for every 20 I play the other."
5,New and Fresh,"A handful of eccentric characters are drawn together in anever-tightening plot towards an unnerving denouement. Set primarilyon the island of Martinique, Spiders and Flies offers us an abundanceof richly evocative details of that island. At the same time, itplunges us into the dark inner landscapes of characters pursuing theirown pleasures regardless of the consequences. As the story unfolds,the darkness and the beauty mingle, creating a heady readingexperience. You won't forget this book, for the horror evoked byScott Adlerberg's fiction has the disturbing ring of truth."
1,Very unhappy with this book,"It did not flow at all. The violence was crude, the characters were not developed at all. I could not get through more than 40%, which was a real push. I tried to skip ahead just to follow the plot lines, and was unable to continue."
1,bad book,It was creepy. I only read a small part of it and stopped. If it was a paperback I would throw it away.
4,A Thriller,"A definite thriller,it has all of the legs of a spider and you are the fly caught in it's web!!! A very good plotline,it kept me turning the pages. Will the main character Paul Raven turn out to be a good guy who attempts to make a clean break from what he perceives as a life of service? What of his best friend Larry, will he help Paul with his life altering plans??? Definitely a good one, with a surprise ending. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't like the ending, it left me flat."
4,Beauty,"There are just some remakes that are worth its simple weight of a beauty. That comes from either the singer, or the actual song. This comes completely from both. Vanessa Williams always has carried her weight with her voice in the music industry, and it still hasn't lost any luster. Alfie is a wonderful remake of the Burt Bacharach tune, which is just completely amazing. The song is beautiful and still shows some great appeal. Although the song hasn't been released in the U.S. for years, it has been finally issued here, because of the 2004 Love Songs record released from Vanessa's music. Get that record, and enjoy this beauty to full light."
2,Good for Some but Not for Us,"This book had lots of good reviews. I'm thinking this is because the owners were already familiar with the song. If you are particular about your children's books, because you'll be reading them over and over, read them first at the library or bookstore to make sure you like them before buying."
2,Didn't like this book.,"I got this book because we loved Baby Beluga so much, so I wanted to try another Raffi book. But I didn't like this one at all. The song was so plain and hard to sing to, and didn't really line up with the pages well. My son was bored by it immediately. And there really wasn't a story to follow along to."
1,Return Policy,"I bought two locks for my house doors for better security. I tried to install one and it did not line up with the hole in my door so I tried to return them. I found out the locks were not returnable and was shocked. I did not see that posted clearly anywhere on Amazon. Second, I finally got them to accept the returns and Medeco said it would be based on examination. Upon receiving them they said the found a small scratch on one so it was not returnable at all and they very reluctantly took the other one back. There was a big discussion about a 20% restocking fee which is $50 for these locks. They ended up taking one lock back but would not take the one back where they found a small scratch. I am now out of the price of one as I own but cannot use it because it won't fit my door. All in all it was a very expensive learning experience. I will check shipping and return policies a LOT closer before ever purchasing anything on Amazon again."
5,Reads like a bestseller.,I loved this book. Very easy to read and difficult to put down. The story of Anne and Catherine from what may have been their point of view. Tragic and fascinating.
4,Well written but very graphic,"I can overlook small errors in a novel. However, the vivid descriptions of the torture chambers made me have to skip over some parts.That out of the way, this is a very well written and haunting novel, although it takes many liberties with history, such as Anne and Catherine meeting. But I do not mind liberties like this taken as it is fiction after all. We get a good feel for Anne and Catherine, as well as Katharine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves. I truly felt Henry's court come alive for me in this book. 4 out of 5 stars, but not for the squeamish."
3,Murder Most Royal,I guess I knew most of the material as I have read a lot about Anne Boleyn. It's definitely not the best one I've read about her. I didn't know much about Catherine Howard but she not a sympathetic character..You can definitely tell that Jean Plaidy is also Victoria Holt as the style of writing is very apparent. I guess I would not read any of her other books.
4,An interesting read,"Although there are historical inaccuracies, and the first chapters are rather slow, I enjoyed this book. The interweaving of the stories of Anne Boleyn and Catharine Howard are interesting and insightful. And yes, the picture of Henry VIII is quite dismal and disturbing, but, despite his accomplishments for England, history does indicate that his first and foremost interest was himself and his own desires.A good read for anyone who is interested in the Tudor period!"
3,"This Book and I Have Aged, And Not Too Well","I read and loved Murder Most Royal when I was young, in the 1970s. I have read several books about Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard since. Though I'm glad to have a Kindle version of this book, I fear that new research on Anne has dampened my enjoyment of Jean Plaidy's novel now. Ms. Plaidy's book is still a good story, but it is no longer as accurate as I thought.The Concubine: A Novelis another oldie, one I liked better then."
3,I wish there was a two and half button,"I got the book expecting another Plaidy hit, but was a little (only a little) dissapointed. I liked the realistic desciption of Mary Boleyn (who has been romanticised even more than femme- fatal Lucretia Borgia ) and made into the plump, pretty, and kind if not unremarkable and ""Beverly Hillish girl I think she was."" I also liked the realistic portriat of Anne boleyn and Catherine Howard. I think Plaidy has the best idea of these two heriones and does an excellent job describing them. But while I like her portriat of these women it was just a little dry (particularly Catherine Howard's part.)"
5,Superdrag is back.,"Wow. I didn't think I would like this album as much as I do (and I thought I'd love it).I am one of those die-hard fanatics who already had pretty much all the demos one could get their hands on, but the quality of them is so poor, these are practically brand new songs. In other words, the mastering is excellent.This album has been in my car cd-player, ipod, itunes, brain, etc. nonstop since the day I received it in the mail. I have a feeling that it will remain that way for a long time. Good-Music-Detectives, let that be a clue.I strongly recommend this album for the following categories of people:1) You like rock and roll music.2) You like really good things.3) You like buying really good things.4) You like smart, catchy, absolutely beautiful songwriting with more than a touch of sadness, longing and nostalgia.5) You have ears.So honestly, if you fall into any of those categories, don't hesitate.-Nathan Maas"
3,Could use more examples and indepth coverage,"The book is great if you need help integrating VSS into your applications or plan to Administer VSS. It does not go in depth into topics I would have liked to see like:- designing the project in VSS- branching theory and practical examples- pinning theory and practical examples- basics of configuration managementThe visual layout was tough too because whitespace was not used well. I found myself having to trace through with my finger to keep track of where I was. Would have liked to see it more like ""Teach yourself VSS in 21 days""."
1,Severly lacking,"Not worth the price tag. It does a fair job of listing the dialog boxes and explaining them, but so does the help. It also lists the command line switches, but again, so does the help. The so-called ""Advanced Features"" alluded to in the synopsis is 23 pages label ""Beyond the basics"" - the help has essentially the same material. One star is generous."
3,Basic Sourcesafe,"Whipple and Roche goe beyond the very limited Microsoft documentation. He actually explains real world applications and how SourceSafe works and doesn't work in a variety of situations. This is the manual that SourceSafe should have had. The addition of screenshots to give you a clear picture about what he is discussing is helpful. Why didn't MS do that? Because that would be user friendly. Don't get me wrong I love most of the stuff MS puts out, it's their documentation that stinks. Thank goodness for authors like Roche that put it in the proper perspective. If you are working with SourceSafe you will want this book. It may not give the tips that ""Real World Software Configuration Management"" does, but it has most of what you will need to administrate SourceSafe. I did expect a bit more for the price, but then books are just overpriced."
5,A must-read!,"Visual SourceSafe (VSS) is a complex product. There are a lot of ways you can use it, and you can find yourself fighting with the product rather than working with it if you don't completely understand how it works.Ted does a great job of explaining the basics of VSS and how to use it properly. Then he really digs in and explains the advanced concepts necessary to make the most out of it. It's obvious the depth of his knowledge on this product is very deep indeed.If you use VSS, this is a must-read book!"
4,Overall Great---At Least One Error Though,"Overall, I imagine young children will be thrilled with this book. It does have one error in the paperback edition at least...it says American Ed White was the first man to walk in space. As we all know, the first man to walk in space was in fact the Soviet Union's Aleksei Leonov."
5,Eyes ove the Atlantic,I think the book is wonderful. I wanted to attain a better sense of Charles A Lindbergh and what betterway then to read something he wrote. He is a good writer and his character comes through. It is also veryenterntaining and down to the practically of having real substance of history in the book. I am greatful to have read it and attained a glimps of a cherished individual in our aviation history.
3,"I love Kansas live, but...","...this CD desperately needs to be remastered! Kansas is one of the finest live performing bands of all time, but you can't tell that from this CD. As several people have already noted, the CD wasn't even cut from the original master tapes, and it shows. With Steve Walsh up front, Kansas had an energy and passion that made them one of the few rock bands that actually recorded better live than in the studio (IMO). This is clearly evident on the original 2 record vinyl LP, but is sadly lacking on the CD, as is one of their finest live songs, ""Closet Chronicles"". Fortunately, I still have my original vinyl LP of this album, but it is beginning to show its age. I'm hoping that a truly high quality CD, SACD or DVD-A remaster of ""Two For The Show"" before my vinyl copy finally wears away."
2,not the full album,"All these great CD reviews... But this CD is not the complete ""Two For The Show"" that was a 2-LP vinyl record set back in the day. So, you're missing some stuff, like ""Closet Chronicles,"" and it's not even remastered from original tapes (sounds all hissy), and still gets your blood going, eh? If KANSAS is reading this, please oh please do a Little-Feat-""Waiting For Columbus""-style remaster on this great live album and INCLUDE THE COMPLETE SHOW! Otherwise, I'd wait to buy it."
3,two for the show,Kansas was one of the tightest live bands i had ever seen. Had the good fortune to catch them about six times in the 80's in Las Vegas...would not miss their show. Had an old cassette of two for the show that i played out so was happy to see the rerelease. purchased this cd and was happy with the quality of the music but really disappointed about the missing tracs...hope the most recent release fixes this. Kansas either a rock band or a group of classical musicians sitting on rockets.
3,this was the end for me,"I followed Kansas right from the inception of their career-- I saw them do the warm up spot for Hawkwind when their first album was released and followed them avidly and saw all their tours up through this album. However, I was horrified when this album came out because they butchered ""Song for America"" with the most horrible editing job I have ever heard on a record-- they literally chopped out the best part of the song! Then the next year they released the dreadful non-prog MONOLITH, and I was fed up. They never really recovered as far as I can tell (Livgren was too key to the songrwriting of their best progressive material), but when violinist/vocalist Steinhardt rejoined them (alas, only to leave again) they could put on a pretty good nostalgia show. Unless they expand this to a double CD with tons of extras and ""Song for America"" intact, I'd avoid this and look for some of their radio broadcasts from the 1970s."
5,Untouchable!,"One of the best live albums ever is re released surpassing expectations!If you are a Kansas fan and own the original Two for the Show, you will LOVE this. You already know disk one, but wait 'till you hear disk two!The previously unreleased live songs will amaze you.If you don't really know Kansas, this is the place to start. They are/were at their best live, and were at their peak when this was recorded. What I like best are the guitar jams leading into Child of Innocence, or in between Portrait and Carry on Wayward Son. They showcase a side of this band that you wouldn't know even existed with commercial radios sorry playing of them.This band is so diverse, from near Metal (Mysteries and Mayhems twin guitars are Priest like) to Blues, Acoustic Guitar, Piano, Prog Rock, Jams,etc. and they pull it off better than anyone.Did I mention the vocals?!! Unreal!This recording should be played for anyone who doesn't give this band the credit they so richly deserve."
5,Simply Magnificent,"""Two for the Show"" has always been my favorite live recording. I remember feeling angry and cheated by the omission of ""Closet Chronicles"" when the CD was first released in the 80's. Not any more. WOW! I am speechless at the superior sound quality and the bounty of never before released A+++ performances from the 77-78 tours. I just can't adequately express my satisfaction at this purchase. Not only do I recommend this item, I would classify this recording as an ""absolute must have"" for any lover of progressive rock or just quality music in general. These guys were at the top of their game during this short period in the 70's and I am so grateful that their superior musicianship and sheer brilliance was captured forever with this recording."
4,In the Prime,"Finally, a remastered version that includes the extra tracks from the show. This is Kansas in their prime. After two killer albums, Leftoverture and Point of Know Return they were definitely riding the high note of their career. So, if you're tired of playing that vinyl album or the original version that first came out on cd, then pick this up. Although it does sound way better then the first version on cd, I still think it could have been remastered in such a better way. Comparing it to some of today's cds that I own, the volume is substantially lower, the drums of Ehart seem removed and the bass lines just aren't there. Not that this isn't a killer cd because if you love Kansas this was the pinnacle of their career. I just would have expected better production given all the technology that is present today. Too bad, but still worth the four stars. Five stars if production was there."
5,Two For The Show is a truly great trip back in time.,"I won't waste space here by doing a full review of the record, but I can say that it is definitely one of the finest mix jobs I have ever heard. The music is clear as a bell and really worth the price. I didn't have this masterpiece before now and I am glad I waited to purchase it in its finished format. For the reviewer who lamented over the copyright issue with regard to burning it to MP3, just get it here on Amazon or Itunes... it is only 10 bucks for goodness sake. Overall, I STRONGLY recommend purchasing this record... you won't regret it."
2,decent,this album is a collection of decent classic rock. it consists of the not so often heard rockers of the 70's. its nice to just put in the player and listen straight through.
3,classic,"I have read about Hazard's Books, Children and Men since library school in the 1970s and often seen it quoted, but never actually read it until now. It is dated, obviously, since the original French was published in 1933. Children's fiction today is more realistic, not to mention in-your-face. Attitudes toward gender and race have changed greatly. But Hazard's passion for exposing children to great literature is contagious. I especially appreciated his discussion of ""What are good books?"" emphasizing sensibility, dignity of play and planting seeds of future knowledge. The last section on ""Heroes"" is especially poignant in the context of his death in occupied France during World War 2."
1,"Yes, you are a loser","This album strikes me as interesting, although very bad. The 1990's was a unique time in Rock in that it allowed bands to talk badly about themselves, but somehow still remain cool. You never felt that they were actual losers, even though the lyrics declared it. I remember listening to ""creep"" by Radiohead and thinking that it was the first time I ever felt that a lead singer was sincerely down on himself - the sincerity of the self-defeating song was what made it forgivable, cool even. This Grand Mal CD is not forgivable. The entire CD is full of self-defeated expressions that come off as loser-ish. You can't declare that you've been beaten unless you've truly put forth extreme effort - so that at least you have a little beauty amidst your defeat - This CD is so half assed that when it comes time for the confession of self-defeat, coolness is not pulled off - but pathetic is."
3,"Good, not great",So it's not Honor Harrington....but Weber remains one of the best story tellers in SF. Good summer reading.
2,bad writing,"I've forced myself about halfway through this book, but the writing is just no good. There are misspellings, grammatical errors, and it just looks like the book was not reviewed by an editor at all before it was published. The story is not novel. It seems to be a series of short stories, pieced together. But there is nothing interesting or new about them. I keep hoping it will pick up at some point - show some interesting twist or turn. In sum: lame writing, lame plot. But who knows, I'm only at page 400. Maybe the next 400 pages will be better."
2,Weak. Very weak.,"I've been a fan of David Weber for years; in fact, Mutineer's Moon and its sequels is still one of my favorite series. The first 4 or 5 Harrington books rocked, and I lovedPath of the Fury.But I've noticed a trend with Weber in the last few years - the last few Harrington books got so bogged down with political and technical claptrap that the story disappeared. It's very disappointing, because Weber used to be able to tell a darn good story.In Fury Born has followed the precedent; I couldn't get past the first 100 pages because of all the other stuff getting in the way. Which is too bad, because I always wanted to know DeVries' backstory."
1,Worst Weber I have read,I can't wait until a new novel by David Weber comes out. I was extremely disappointed in this work. I had read the original and had found it mediocre. This added nothing but alot of words. There is little plot and no character development beyond the main character. I am glad I didn't buy this one. Probably only one I don't own.
4,"Ah, space opera....","As a big fan of the Honor Harrington series, I have been reading a great deal of Weber's other works. This is one of the best ""non-Honor"" works I have yet seen. Weber is a master of the space/naval genre these days, and this work certainly matches to that standard.The only problem (and it's a minor one) that I had with this was that it covered too much ground. Weber did it very well, but it seemed that some things were compressed to set up the next stage of the story.Still, the whirwind tour of this woman's life, plus the addition of...well...strange mythogy appearing in an unexpected way, makes for a doozy of a story. I don't know if this is the start of a series, but I will look forward to others."
3,Disappointed - still a solid read,"""Path of the Fury"" was the first book I ever read from David Weber and introduced me to him. I would said POTF and the first Honor Harrington book suffered from a pulp fantasy description on the back, but a A+ read between the covers.In Fury Born, an expanded version of POTF, takes a tight, focused story and instead of filling in the blanks as you go (leaving a lot to your imagination) it steps you through the whole thing, spelling everything out for you.There is also a clear difference in the style of the writing from David Weber of now (sections 1 and 2) and the David Weber of then (Section 3). Not all of the tech seemed to completely match up, either.Overall I liked the book and I don't recommend you NOT read it. But the original Path of the Fury was better edited, focused and enjoyable. In Fury Born is more of a plodding, deliberate read."
3,A Tad Redundant,"Weber had already written a very good book in Path of the Fury - we didn't really need this one too. As you read it, you realize the most compelling writing was from the first iteration."
4,A REAL COUNTRY WESTERS CD,"HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN ED BRUCE CD AT MUSIC STORES FOR A LONG TIME WITH NO LUCK UNTIL I FOUND IT ON AMAZON. HOW REFRESHING TO HEAR GOOD COUNTRY MUSIC WITH OUT THE ROCK INFLUENCE. I WOULD CLASSIFY IT AS COUNTRY WESTERN WITH A SWING MODE. ED BRUCE HAS A RICH BARATONE VOICE WITH DISTINCT PRONOUNCIATION. I LOVE THIS CD AND IT WILL BE ON THE TOP OF MY CD STACK. THANKS, CHARLIE BIG SKY"
5,Certainly Not The Last of The Cowboy Songs.....,"To tell ya the truth, I had forgotten about Ed Bruce, until I had seen a picture of my favorite country female, Charly McClain. She was in a black and red dress, standing next to Ed Bruce with their arms around each other at the Music City News Awards in 1982. Anyways, now that I remember him, I remember that he is a VERY good musician/actor. He penned the grammy nominated Tanya Tucker song, ""Texas When I Die,"" and Tommy Roe's, ""Shiela."" He also wrote a song, ""Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboy's,"" (his biggest hit) later remade by Waylon and Willie. And who doesn't love, ""Girls, Women and Ladies,"" ""You're The Best Break This Old Heart Ever Had,"" ""My First Taste Of Texas,"" and standin' long side of James Garner in the TV series ""Bret Maverick"" the theme to the TV show. So if ya like cowboys and cowboy songs, I'd grab this one. It's the only CD that I have found that has the most of Ed Bruces songs."
3,Great Book,I bought this book for reference and it has become a valuable book is helping me reference some of my families mysteries.
3,product is problematic,"I have owned Bose electronics and have always been very satisfied. What I did not realize when I purchased this system was the difficulty in integrating it with additional elements throughout the rest of my house. Yes, it could be done, but at a very HIGH price. For example, just adding some additional ambiant sound to my adjoining kitchen area to where the system would be installed was going to run an additional $1,000.00 in equipment plus installation. And that was just the beginning. Sadly, this has sent me looking for alternatives and most likely picking various components from several name brands to do the job that I was hoping an ""all in one"" system would accomplish.Thanks and again, I love Bose products, but this one just isn't going to work out this time around.Kevin Bailey"
5,noevir eye cream,Bought for wife this is probably the fifth time buying this product. She loves it. She found out about the cream from her cousin a beautician. It definitely reduces bags and crow feet and even eliminate it. This product is expensive if you buy retali. Definitely got it at a bargain price at amazon.
4,"un po' demodè, ma sempre di grande effetto",Peccato che in Italia i cantanti tedeschi non siano molto popolari
5,good old fashioned listening music,"I heard Udo Jurgens when I was very young. The ""Aber bitte mit Sahne"" stuck in my mind for many years before I heard it again. I looked on Amazon and was delighted to find the cd is still available. Thanks,The music is typically German folk music, not to be heard everyday all day , but now and again, it is a pleasure."
2,"Great product, as always, but slow shipping via seller!","My customer prefers this product, and when I ordered it for her via Amazon this time, I was disappointed that it took a full ten days for her to receive it. With a phone call, I discovered that the seller isn't the manufacturer. That explains it... a middleman. I won't go this route again."
2,Sedaka Sings Elevator Music,"Listening to this, I truly realized that Sedaka made his greatest contributions to pop music in the '50's and '60's. Aside from the few hits (Laughter in the Rain, Bad Blood, Lonely Nights, etc.) he produced in the '70's, Sedaka's M.O.R. ""Second career"" mainly produced songs for the Geritol set. Buy yourself a good early Sedaka compilation (Sings the Hits comes to mind) and give this one to your grandparents."
5,The Best Of Rocket,"There was a British release titled My Friend on Polydor that was short lived. I am thankful this release came out and remastered beautifully. If you are looking for just the hits from Neil, this is a great collection that includes number one hits, Bad Blood and Laughter In The Rain with my personal favorites The Immigrant (the tribute to John Lennon), and The Hungry Years. If you want to complete your Sedaka collection, may I suggest the All Time Greatest Hits On RCA ? Enjoy and Stay 2nd :-)"
1,Live,"I bought this album thinking it was a greatest hits compilation. I was wrong. It's a LIVE ALBUM. I have not listened to any more than what it took to hear the applause in the beginning of all the tracks, so I can't vouch for the quality of the recording itself. But if you are looking for the original hits, don't buy this import! Sedaka fans might want it for their collection, I don't know, someone else might want to write a review of the quality of the performance. But if all you want are the original recordings of the latter part of Sedaka's career, look elsewhere. You will not find them here."
2,Confusing,"This is the second novel I have read from this author and while I enjoyed the first one, this one simply confused me. Stovall takes a look at one of his favorite subject matters - the role of black people in society and in particular, in this novel, their victimization - through the eyes of a ""somewhat"" forgotten novelist - Yerby who has been on record as saying that black people are responsible for their lot in life.Yet, at the same time, they are asking Yerby to recant his words or they may never exist again.I found this book highly confusing to read and although I got the basic message coming out of the storyline, it felt as though the role of Yerby was overextended greatly.I am still scratching my head on this one."
2,"Very different, but interesting.","This was a strange and confusing book. It's about Frank Yerby, he is on his deathbed, and really unhappy about it. He's a writer who's books don't have readers, and the characters of his books aren't happy about that either. I thought was a really odd book.The book did wander, and even though I understood the basic message I just couldn't really understand it all. Maybe it is for greater minds than mind I don't know."
4,Inspiring Story,"Eugene Stovall is an admirer of the writings by Frank Yerby. Frank Yerby was an African American writer that's best known as being the first African American to write a best-selling novel and to have a book purchased by a Hollywood studio for a film. Also, Yerby is an admirer of Victorian age writers like William Lord Byron. In addition, the story centers on Lady Sumayla who is a mother of a prince. This book is like an autobiography of Frank Yerby's life."
4,A good general reference for any naval buff.,"The book is a good addition to any professional salior or naval buff's library. The pictures, for the most part are of good quality, but some are of little value as they are bow-on or stern-on shots. Also, the author gets the California and Virginia class vessels of the USN (CGNs) mixed together when they are two distinct classes. However, as all vessels of both classes are (or soon will be) no longer in service it is not a big issue. With the rapid pace of naval events a newer edition is needed; say in 2000-2001. The key recognition features of each class is a good feature, allowing the reader to pick them up from the picture on the opposite page."
3,limited reference of alot of ships,"This was a good basic reference , but if your looking for detail you wont find it in this book.It has a picture of each ships broadside and a rundown of the statistics. IE: range , how many guns, how many in service,ect."
4,All encompassing guide to modern warships.,"Well, as a Jane's Pocket Guide, it pretty much outlines all of the ships currently in service around the world. It breaks them down by type and by nation. It also even lists the individual names of each ship in each class which is pretty cool if you need to find out what ship and what class your loved one is stationed on.The only negative comment I have about the book is that all of the pictures are black and white. Now I realize that some ships from around the world are not that readily available to get a color photograph of, but I must assume that most should be. So why not use them?"
4,Works good.,This product arrived on time and in good shape. Had no problems installing on my mic stand. I has nice color and easy to bend.
1,This product is pretty much unusable for any of my mics!,"According to the packaging this gooseneck is supposed to hold one pound, the problem is that most microphones weigh two to three or more pounds (something I wish I measured before I purchased this). I seriously wonder what the designers were thinking when they designed this.Also, the end that the mic clip is supposed to attach to seems awkwardly sized and only one of my four clips screwed on successfully. It also seems as though the threading is not going to last and is going to strip rather quickly.I would think about spending a bit more on a higher quality brand before throwing away your money on this product."
2,Flimsy but I made it work,This gooseneck is pretty flimsy. I ended up filling it with epoxy in the shape that I wanted it. Now it will hold anything.It gets the job done though and the price was right.
1,Far Too flexible for use with a professional microphone,I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)
1,"On-Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck, Black","This gooseneck, after having been flexed a mere handful of times, began to break: inferior quality! The whole point of a gooseneck attachment is that you can bend it, and this one did not like to bend."
5,I was thinking it and you said it... :-),One of the funnies sets in comedy.. (Smart as hell it had me laughing so hard I awoke up my neighbors. It's a must see and the best one he has done! Yet...
5,"""wear a diaper"" funny!","Bill Burr has a way of being funny without being actually mean or base or even racist. it's strange, because he talks about the same stuff other comics talk about but he always spins it to be funnier, and his comedy never has that hateful aftertaste that is so common in contemporary comedy."
5,One of the best comedians around...,"Excellent stand-up. Bill Burr is one of the best comedians around right now. Bill Burr, Louis CK, and Jim Gaffigan I think are about the best right now. Also search for ""Bill Burr Philadelphia"" on youtube. Hilarious. Bill also has a newer DVD out."
5,Funny; Beginning To End,"Honestly, one of the hardest working and honest comedians today. I have enjoyed this DVD from the moment I saw it on Comedy Central, to the days I put it on my iPod for car rides with my fiance. We both love this DVD and it is seriously true... every moment of things he says either happen to normal people, or so called ""psycho's"" that he talks about.I would buy this and buy a 2nd one and give it to a friend. It's that good!"
5,"Oh where, oh where can my UNDERDOG be........",Underdog is a fantastic cartoon that many believed was short lived. Thanks to this new box set eveyone can enjoy the entire series and share them with generations to come.
5,the underdog show,i got this set for my son and i to revisit my old days and share some of my childhood memories with him. my son being just 3 yrs old he loves it he make qoutes from the shows and constantly sings the theme song
4,What's with the short running times?,"Got this for my birthday - So far, the first season episodes I have watched run about 17 and a half minutes in length. I'm pretty sure each should be around 25 minutes each for a half-hour TV show of that era...so what's missing? OR, have they been sped up?Otherwise, very pleased with the set. I, for one, am glad Tennessee Tuxedo wasn't included: Those segments always seemed out of place to me any way, and they weren't funny. Good job, SHOUT!"
5,UnderDog!!!!!,"Way.....by far one of my favorite cartoons as a child! This is the ultimate collection, hands down! When I saw this I just simply had to buy it (my wife just loved the price) and couldn't wait to start watching. As always, everything arrives on time and exactly as described. As far as technical stuff, it's the best they could do with what was available, I have no complaints....."
1,Great while it lasted,"I agreed with the other reviewers and would have given this drive 5 stars if I had written a review earlier. It installed perfectly and ran faultless and quietly, for the first two months. Then it stopped working and refused to recognise there was even a DVD in the drive. The breakdown was sudden. It wrote a DVD and then it stopped recognising any disks. I tried it in another machine with the same problem so it is the hardware.I wont pretend that my experience is typical but it may have something to do with the fact that this is a cheap drive and maybe you really do get what you pay for. I'm not trying to put you off this drive but if you do a lot of DVD writing then maybe a better drive might work longer."
2,Didn't last as long as an incandescent lightbulb,"As other reviewers experienced, this drive was superb in its performance, reading and writing anything which could be thrown at it. In this sense, the best burner I ever plugged into my system. Unfortunately, as other reviewers also experienced, its durability is simply inadequate, making it a poor value for its price. Mine lasted 4 days beyond the end of the warrantee period. To their credit, the company still honored the warrantee, but only after considerable difficulty communicating with them. Only a computer tech friend was able to contact them effectively in order to make the arrangements -- not adequate support. I was without the drive for nearly a month by the time all of this got done.SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH."
2,Disapointment Pirate Ship,"Well I too am disappointed in this purchase. I bought this for my son's 4th Birthday and I have been putting it together ever since! The pieces fall off, nothing stays where it should. I understand the concept of building and rebuilding but it should be because you want to not because it keeps falling apart. I am seriously thinking of super gluing all if the pieces together (except the pirates). I can't believe that Fisher Price would make something so flimsy that you can't play with it."
2,Not worth the money,My 5 year old BEGGED for this toy for Christmas. He has only played with it maybe 3 times in 4 months. It comes apart too easily and my 5 year old can't put it back together himself.
3,Fun to play with--no fun to constantly put back together,"My sons (3,4 and 6) all loved the idea of the Pirate ship. They do enjoy playing with it; however, it falls apart constantly and it's not that much fun to play with a toy that falls apart everytime you touch it. I have to put it back together at least once or twice a day. We are considering super gluing the parts together. If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased this toy."
2,Terrible toy,"I can remember when Fisher-Price toys were a whole lot friendlier...all the characters have weapons and ""fierce"" expressions. A friend of mine bought this for her three yr old daughter because she saw the box and begged, then after it was opened, the girl refused to play with the ""mean people"". The concept is good, but why does it have to be so violently oriented?"
2,wouldn't buy this ship for kids younger then 6,my son got the pirate ship for a gift and he is 4 years old. he got so frustrated with it because all of the pieces kept folling off. the mast wouldn't stay up for anything! and the nets to the mast would not fit. I don't know what fisherprice is thinking with this toy line but this one was horrible.
4,A suggestion,"My son loves to play with this toy at his friends house..which is why I intend to buy it this year for Christmas. The boys are 5 1/2 now, but when they originally purchased the toy he was a young 4 and had some difficulty with it staying together. Simple solution.....she used a cold glue gun sparingly to help some of the looser parts remain stable. Later, when he became more adept at manipulating the pieces, she simply cracked the glue off and bingo...new toy for an older boy. Don't let the toys beat you..."
3,Well written but poorly paced SF Mystery,"""The Shift"" is a well written, but poorly paced SF Mystery novel.The story takes place in a near-future NYC. The main character, Alex Munn is a VR-Soap producer going thorough amid-life identity crisis, divorce, and serious psychotherapy. Suddenly, attempts start on his life and people start dieing around him in a way that points to Alex Munn: psychopath.First, the novel is not quite cyberpunk. The main character is too mainstream. In addition, the tech is really incidental.""The Shift"" is well written. The prose is descriptive and gritty. The tech is well considered and supports the storyvery well. The plot however, is a little cliched. The badguys come from central casting. The plots within plots have been done before. The biggest problem I had is the story is not well paced. It takes the author 450 pages to wrap things up. Then he uses an additional 50 pages to re-wrap it. A sharp editor could prune 100 pages out of the book."
3,Lexar Flash Memory,"These cards are getting harder to find. Unfortunately the advertised picture shows a 4X, but the ones that arrived were not."
2,ali wants nelly's spot bad,ali never had a serious fanbase cept for being affiliated with nelly so if you';re a serious goodie mob or gipp fan pick it up ugk pops up on here troo so get it only for that too bad st. louis rappers are'nt getting much play I'd rather spend my money on murphy lee's project.
1,"I did not want to, but I did read it.","The review title says it all. I believe for one to get an accurate perspective, one must read both sides. Anyone living through the Vietnam Era and serving in the military through this would truly like to burn this book.Those that were on the ""peace"" side need to be thanked. Thank them for aiding a people killing 58,000 American soldiers, thank them for helping kill 4.5 million Laotians, Cambodians and Vietnamese. It was there peace movement that forced the politicans to abandon these people and leave them to be slaughtered by the enemy they aided.The activists and supporters of the peace movements have the blood of these millions on their hands. This book needs to read by all those that want to know and understand the peace movements of that day and this day are nothing more than appeasements to those wishing to destroy the freedoms so many have died for.This book is trash."
5,THEY SOUND GREAT! EXCELLENT HARMONY!,"I BECAME A DICK AND DEE DEE FAN THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ""THE MOUNTAIN'S HIGH"".WHEN I HEARD THEM DO ""TELL ME"" AND ""WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND IN LOVE"" I BECAME AN EVEN BIGGER FAN!THEY JUST BLEW ME AWAY WITH THAT ELECTRIFYING BLEND OF HARMONIZATION. THEY MADE YOU FEEL THEY REALLY WERE IN LOVE AND THAT'S WHY THEY SOUNDED SO GREAT.I WISH THEY HAD RECORDED MORE BALADS.JUST THINK WHAT THEY COULD'VE DONE WITH ""SOUL AND INSPIRATION"" AND SOME OF THE STUFF THE RIGHTOUS BROS. DID (NOT THAT THEY WEREN'T GREAT TOO).I DEFINETELY RECOMMEND THIS C.D.THEY'RE A COMBINATION OF SWEET AND POLISHED ONLY WITH ALOT OF SOUL."
2,Best of Dick and Dee Dee,I was not impressed with the sound quality of this CD. I did not think that it sounded like the original. I would not recommend this product.
3,fair,"probably the best melding of two voices there ever was, but the sound quality is very distorted, hopefully a better version will come out, these two deserve it"
1,Didnt work,"This item does not come with a buffing cloth, and did nothing for the light scratches on my eyeglasses or sunglasses."
3,ok,ive noticed increased visability since using the scratch b gone. the scratches are still there but are less noticable. this product did not arrive in or with a poly bag however which was a bit dissappointing.
2,An Editing Nightmare,"This book had potential to be a definitive guide to XML schema. This is not the kind of book you can pick up and read cover to cover (unless insomnia is a real condition for you, in which case this book may help). It is, by no means, a tutorial of XML schema - or even a reference. It's more of an exploratory academic walk of the W3C recommendation and all of its foibles and nuances. There is wealth of information in this book, if you can glean it out from inbetween the droning prose and historical diatribe.O'Reilly should be shamefully embarassed for ever letting this book go to print in the condition it is. It is replete with errata, typos, and slopped together examples. This book is destined to frustrate those new to XML schema. An uncharacteristicly poor level of quality for O'Reilly."
3,Tough read,"This book is very dry and terse. It has all of the required content but it doesn't provide much perspective of how it should be used. You could use it as a reference, but I recommend the XML Schema Companion before this one."
2,Semi-techie's evaluation,"This book tells you what you need to know. However, it is a bit of a hard slog because it doesn't tell you why you need to know it. It also throws in obscure acronyms and not only expects you to know what they stand for, but what those protocols/standards/programs imply. Yes, you can learn all you need to know about SQL schema, (and more than you need to know - without telling you why you need to know it, you don't know what to skip), but it is a little more painful than it has to be."
3,It is not easy to read it but there is not so much of other books,"XML Schema is used almost everywhere (in connection with XML documents, Web Services, SOAP etc.). So I as other people needed to master XML Schema. There is not a great choice of XML Schema books. Specification is already quite getting old. The book is not easy to read. I read it sequentially chapter after chapter and I mastered a lot of basic rules. The main problem now I see is, XML Schema itself does not give you too much of design freedom. Sometimes you need to define a structure (data type) according value of other elements. So now I know mainly what is not possible to do in XML Schema.After all I have to recommend the book. You have to read it twice. So I have just bought another XML Schema book from Priscilla and I hope I will get to know XML Schema from other point of view."
1,THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ,"not only was this the worst book I ever read, it was by far Steele's worst book ever written. I hope Steele's Klone that wrote this book is GONE and the real STEELE will return for a terrific comeback."
1,The worst Danielle Steel book I've ever read.,"All of the women in my family have always been Danielle Steel fans, and several years ago I began to read her books as well. I have never read one I did not like...until now. My Grandmother lent me the book and told me not to bother because it was horrible, but I couldn't beleive Danielle Steel could write a bad book. When I began the book it was fine. Once the klone arrived it all went down hill...way down hill. It was too far fetched for my taste. Hopefully Danielle Steel will stick to her previous writing style in the future."
1,Did Danielle really write this?,"My recollections: sparkly clothes, an alcholic bionic man, and tons and tons of pre-marital sex. I had to check the cover several times to see if Danielle was truly the author. I concede ... it had me laughing out loud several times, and I kinda wished I had a boyfriend like the outgoing, sparkly clone."
1,Not one of her best works.,"I didn't like the ""Klone"". I thought it was too far fetched a story. I love most of her books but this is at the bottom of my list."
1,"Weak Storline, Bad Characters","The story has no real point. It seems to go nowhere fast and gives us no real reasons to want to finish. Sorry .. but she can and has done much better in the past. Lets hope for a return to the intense, spine tickling novels of the past and that this was just a one-timer.A few friends and I are poking fun at this badly written book we for some odd reason chose to read for the Book Club."
1,"Please, Spare me","Being a huge fan of Danielle Steel's novels, I thougth she had learned her lesson with The Gif- her readers didn't care for those characters - they're dull and there was no there, there."
1,Forget THIS,"A large online bookclub I'm in decided to read this book, heh, what a BIG mistake. Practically everyone hated this book, except this true die-hard Danielle Steel fan of ours.Hehe, to have some fun we all- yes ALL- of us decided to write a review for The Klone and I on Amazon.com, on the same day. I must say, there will be a barrel of laughs for all of us."
1,Did not like it at all,"Have always enjoyed Danielle Steel books until this one.Too many characters, rather confusing.No real suspense to it."
1,VERY DISSAPPOINTING,"I am an avid reader of all of Danielle Steel books, except this one. Characters are simply unbelievable and uninteresting.The prose at times is very bad and indeed sometimes the sentences really dont make much sense.Please bring back the old Steel fast!"
1,"1star for the 1st half, 0 for the ending.","I usually love DS, but this book was a major disappointment for me. I flew through the first half, thinking it was going to be a great read, but the last half was a complete let down. I hope she goes back to her surprise endings like in her older books."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"I generally enjoy Steel's books. However this one I only finished to find out if she had invented a quirky finish. I felt it was poorly researched, quite repetetive and seemed to have been written in a hurry..If you are a Steel fan this one can be skipped. There are many more good fiction books on the market."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book was not only a total waste of time, it was a senseless waste of the lumber it took to create the paper it was written on. By far the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. Amazon...this book is not worthy of even one star but that was the least you allow us to give."
1,This book gets my top honor of....,"...the stupidest book I have ever read. I kept waiting for the book that would have a different plot from all the others she has written, and this is what we got. Needless to say, this was the straw that broke that camel's back and I will never read another Danielle Steel book ever again."
2,Lame as hell,"this book was pretty bad.. IT had no story point and i think the things with the klones was stupid. But i gave it another star just because she is danielle steel , and she is the shizzel..hey we all make mistakes..."
2,Big disappointment!,"I thought The Klone and I was a disappointing story that might make for aninteresting comedy/sci-fi flick, but not something I expected to read from D. Steel. The story started off so well, up until the Klone was introduced. I would love to have Ms. Steel re-write the book in her usual way--making it a true romance and not a sci-fi novel."
1,what a crazy story,"i have read almost of all of danielle steel's books, and this definitely was one of her worst. after reading such a great story as The Long Road Home, which i thought was her best, i feel she must have just plain run out of ideas. i found myself chuckling at the story because it was so far-fetched."
3,LIGHTEN UP-IT WAS JUST FOR FUN,"Sometimes, it's fun just to read for enjoyment and nothing more. And this was the case. It was silly and farfetched, but had fun reading it.I would like to know just how D. Steele has time to write all of these books and apparently have time to have 4 or is it 5 husbands. I hear that she has people doing her writing for her. What a shame. I have to say her books have gotten better as time goes by, but is she writing them?"
2,Save your money; go to the library,"The book is a creative idea but Danielle Steel copped out at the end. I was very disappointed. Usually I like her books. Save your money and wait for a friend to buy it so you can borrow it. But then again, you can't get your time back from reading it."
2,"You have got to be kidding, Ms. Steel!","Unfortunately I'm extremely backlogged on my reading and currently have 5 Danielle Steel books in the cue. I just finished ""The Klone and I"" and have lost my enthusiasm for my marathon Steel sessions. Do I dare pick up another one of her books on the off chance that it will just as disappointing? My advise is to steer clear of this outlandish fantasy. It is too far out there to be believable."
1,Bad book,"This book was plain old horrible. There's no other way to explain how it was, it was just BAD. Really truely BAD."
1,What a terrible first impression!,This was my first Steel book and it will definitely be my last. Steel does not pique the reader's interest one iota...she merely drags you along for a rather unenjoyable and uninteresting ride. This book was incredibly simple minded and predictable. It lacked a flair for detail that I believe a best selling novel should have. Very slow and sloppy. Don't waste your money.
1,Confusing,Steel writes great stuff that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This one seems to cheat. What is going on in this book ?!
1,Not on the same level as some of Steel's other books.,"The Klone and I was a bit disappointing. It might be a fine light read, but don't expect anything on the level with The Ghost or The Long Road Home."
1,Just Plain Stupid,"The whole idea of the klone is stupid enough in itself, but everything in this book was stupid! Glad I got this from the library and didn't pay money for it!"
1,Desperate for income?,"I think it's been said - thank God - by a number of readers in different ways: ""What was Danielle Steel thinking when she wrote this?"" Did she need the money that badly? I have always enjoyed her novels even though the endings are becoming more and more predictable, because they allow me to escape and fantasize just a little. I couldn't even finish this, because the premise was so way out! Leave science fiction to the science fiction writers, Danielle."
1,Don't Even bother to buy this book,"If you're going to read this book, don't. Just avoid it, even a die-hard Steel fan should not be exposed to such trash like this. Well, now that I think about it ALL of her books are trash, but I have enjoyed a few of her books, a FEW, excluding this one of course, it was terribly dull and common."
1,Waisted time and money,"The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad!"
3,It wasn't that bad!,"After reading all the bad reviews on this site, I decided I would not buy this book and wait for the library to get it. Well, I finished it yesterday, and yes it was very silly and far-fetched but I didn't think it was that bad! Actually, I thought it was a little better than The Ranch which was very boring! At least this one was short."
1,What was Danielle thinking?,I love Danielle Steel books. She has created some great female characters that I love being part of but I don't have a clue what she was thinking when she wrote this book. I can't give this book any stars. I kept reading thinking that somehow she would tie it all in together in a sensible fashion but she didn't. The main character has an affair with a clone? Please! I read until the end but I regretted sticking around so long!!!!! I only wished I hadn't bought the hardback and wasted so much money. Too far out!
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"Aside of ""Four Blondes"" by Candice Bushnell, this is hands down THE WORST book I have ever read. If you like Danielle Steel (as I do) you will be sorely disappointed. I felt as though she had made a committment to write a book by a certain date and cranked this one out in one evening while drunk. The story about a clone could have been interesting, had it been written more believably. Don't waste your time. If you want to read a good Danielle Steel, read ""The Ghost"" (my personal favorite) or ""Summer's End"" instead."
1,Having problems to go to sleep?? This book's for you!,"I really am a big fan of Danielle Steel's books, but was I disappointed by this one! I looks as though she had to edit a book, no matter the content. I really didn't find the style I usually love, and the story really is bad. What is the point of telling us about bionic aerobics?? It doesn't sound real at all. Usually, i don't let her books down until it is finished, but i really had a hard time finishing this one, and to be honest, i didn't give a damn about the end of the book. If you are fans of Steel's books, do not read this book!"
2,Mindless Entertainment,"The Klone And I is a silly story of a love triangle between Stephanie,Peter and Peter's clone,Paul.The novel is simply outrageous and provides mindless entertainment.Too bad that this book got published.This is arguably the worst Danielle Steel novel I have ever read."
1,Can I give it half a star? Or less?,This book was a complete disappointment and I wish I could get the hours of my life back that I wasted on this book.
1,Steel should be embarrased: Clone lovers?,"I am mystified why Steel would try to design a bionic robot that acts as normally and performs as well in bad as a real man. Yes, Steel has done this. There is Peter, a nice guy and high-tech manufacturer. Stephanie falls for Peter. Peter has to go away. He sends an identical Peter, whosename is Paul to take his place. Paul is a robot with a heart. She can hardly tell the two apart. The time frame is hard to follow. Weeks seem to pass without notice but also things go so fast that keeping track ishard. Her concluding chapter is a mockery of confusion and deception.Save your money. Look to Vickie Thompson or Debra Webb for romance andintrigue. Read MESSAGE FROM NAM. My favorite Steel book, especiallyappropriate around Easter, Thanksgiving or the gift giving seasons isTHE GIFT. Save your penny and postage."
1,Glad I borrowed it from the public library.,"Danielle Steel has her moments, and this wasn't one of them! I read the book in under five hours--including time out for dinner--and was glad it didn't take me longer. The first two chapters were great! They reminded me of a couple I know who had similar problems. After that, the book became a cop-out and silly. She tried had to rehash her own worn out storylines and thought she'd be cute by making the Klone be bionic! Hasn't Danielle read anything about the capabilites of today's cloning? Boring! Don't waste the time unless you have a specific need to read all her titles--and borrow if from the library!"
1,Totally a waste of time,"One of the worst books I've ever read. I have and have read everyone of D Steele's books, but if this is an indication of the direction she is going I won't be buying any more!!"
1,This was a book of nonsense and a complete disappointment.,I was extremely disappointed by this book. I had to force myself to finish it. The characters and storyline had no suspense or sense. Dont't waste your money!
1,Worst Yet,"Danielle, How could you???. I struggled through ""HIS Bright LIGHT"", thinking it had to get better, now ""THE KLONE AND I"" is even worse, which seems impossible!!. Save your money and boycott this horrific book! and the boring, wimpy characters."
1,PATHETIC JUST ABOUT SUMS IT UP,"I bought this book with excitement. I read her other short work, THE GIFT, and liked it. I wasn't expecting another teenage story. This book was AWFUL. Ifound many instances where plot lines took a turn that couldn't be explained and then just went....nowhere. They were dropped completely! I have read every single book by Steel (being a big fan), but this was trash."
1,Dreadful,"Hands down one of the worst books I've yet to read, and by Danielle Steel of all people! PASS this book."
1,Amazon wouldn't let me give no stars!!,"I'm glad that I got this from the library instead of spending my money on it. The heroine of this book has no redeeming qualities; I was rooting against her for the entire book. Every plot 'twist' was screamingly obvious. The characters were under-developed, and a huge suspension of disbelief was required to buy into the whole story. I think this is the last Steel book that I will read."
1,A boring read with little suspense,"This is obviously Ms. Steel's weakest story and by far the least romantic. The dialogue is trite and the relationships ""old"". It is more an expose on alternative lifestyles. I certainly hope the author can refresh herself next ""go around""."
1,Cause of Death: Weak ending.,"Good beginning, a lot of distracting characterizations in the middle, and Steel's affliction for bad endings caused the death of this book."
1,Very poor!!!,"a story with a neurotic self-obsessed woman. This was very poor and I will hope upon hope that the next will be a tad better, come on, let's get it on!"
1,Poor characterization and lack of attention to detail.,"For years I'd wanted to pick up a book by Danielle Steel. I have been disappointed by this book. No plot, no character, no nothing! Get something else, PLEASE!!!"
3,very different,i have mixed feelings on whether i enjoyed the novel or not. It is not the way ds usually writes and at some point i thought it was a really crazy novel whilst at others it was great!
1,This can't be a Danielle Steel book!!,"I am an avid Danielle Steel reader, but this book was very disappointing. After reading the negative reviews, I purchased it anyway. It was not good reading even from the beginning; however I waded through it. I hope her next books are better than this one, or I will be an ex-Danielle Steel fan. I cannot believe she wrote such meaningless trash!!"
1,Shocking type of book for Danielle Steele,"I have read each and every book that Danielle Steele has written and have enjoyed each and everyone of them until......The Klone & I.What was she thinking to write such a horrible book - it was absolutely dreadful. I wish I could return this book and I thank heavens that I bought it in paperback instead of my usual hard cover. This book is now filed under ""G"" and I wouldn't even consider passing it on.Lori - Toronto, Canada"
1,Bad,This was a boring book. I read all of Danielle Steel's books and this was one of her worst and most generic text.
1,Not Danielle Steele's style,"I am a collector of Danielle Steel's books. All are hardbounds, but 4. I guess you can tell by that, that I am a big Danille Steel fan, but I COULD NOT take this book. I read 3 paragraphs and will trade it in to the used book store I go to. This book was TERRIBLE, and I did not find anything funny in the first 3 paragraphs. I was just plain bored."
3,It was light enjoyable reading that had me laughing.,It was the typical Danielle Steel format but had some real funny spots that kept me reading. If you liked the movie Multiplicity you will like this book.
1,Disappointment!!!,I usually love Danielle Steel's novels. This book was a real disappointment. She was trying to be humorous but I was not amused. Try again Danielle! Read The Ghost instead!!
1,STUPID!,"I can't believe I actually bought this book! I love Danielle Steel, but this book had to be a joke! I'll make sure I come here to check the reviews before I ever buy a book again!"
4,A Wild One from Danielle Steel,"This book was hysterical!! A totally unexpected and wild one from a sometimes predictable author-I found this book to be downright funny and beyond satire, and I thought that most women who have hit the dating scene recently could definitely relate. I think you have to read this one tongue-and-cheek and just realize that it is a true departure from a talented writer who has been pigeon-holed a bit too much. Have fun and let go-this book will allow you to do both."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I read this book because I received it from Doubleday bookclub and neglected to return it initially, as I normally would have. It sat in my laundry room for a year, but out of curiosity (and an open mind for supporting writers, whatever the genre), I read it. I will NEVER read another Danielle Steele book. Since reading The Klone and I, I've heard that Ms. Steele employs ghost writers to pen some of her many stories. That might even be more inexcusable than actually writing such slop. ""Writing"" like this is an insult to readers. If you like romance, read Nora Roberts or Barbara Taylor Bradford. Another good author for romance readers is Maeve Blinchy. These writers put real talent and rich story building into their work."
1,Least interesting book I've ever read.,"After years of hearing Danielle Steel's named mentioned and seeing the craze her books cause, I finally picked this one up on vacation to see what the fuss was all about. I still do not know. This book had zero substance. I know she's a popular author and no one realistically expects her works to become classics, but this book was simply air and fluff. I treasure books, but I actually think I threw this one away to get it out of circulation."
1,Pathetic waste of paper,"What was Danielle Steel thinking (or smoking) when she wrote this book? Her books are usually quite good, but this one is far from it. The concept of a ""klone"" in a romance novel is intriguing --- What possibilities it could have! (Too bad Ms. Steel couldn't think of any.) The writing was poor and the attempts at comedy lame beyond belief. Thank goodness I rented the book from the library and didn't waste my money."
1,very bad writing,"The WORST book I have every read by anyone including Danielle Steele. Very disappointing. I only read it because my Mom wanted me to, so we could laugh at it together. Talk about sad."
1,An absolute waste of time and money!,This had to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I tried really hard to stick with it to the end (only because it was the only book left on the bookstands at the beach). Word must have gotten around.
1,The worst Danielle Steele book!,"I have read almost all of her novels and loved all of them but this novel was terrible.Where in the world did she come up with this story? She must be running out of stories, if she has to write about a woman who falls in love with a man and his klone. I was so disappointed with this book."
1,"Save yourself, return the book NOW!","Okay, I read only half the book BECAUSE it was sooo bad, I've never read or have desired to read Steele and recieved this as a gift...I tried to read it, but the style, the plot, the characters THE NAME DROPPING...giving my brain a good dose of quality and falling back into bed with two collections by Alice Munro and some fine poetry."
2,Not DS at her best.,"I love Danielle Steel's work but this was not my type of enjoyable reading. Funny in the beginning I could not get a grasp of the concept that anyone could make a person so perfect as to make you believe they were real i.e. skin, hair, eyes, brain. heart. I guess that was my bottom line. It was not believable.It was definitely a step out of the ordinary for DS."
4,Laughing out loud!!!,"First, let me start by saying that Karen from South Carolina. Danielle Steel is a she, not a he. No wonder you didn't like this book. I thought it was great! You people that are saying ""did she need money this bad"" and all the other negative things, have you ever written a novel? Isn't Danielle Steel entitled to write whatever she wants? I doubt anyone twisted your arms to read this. I was laughing out loud when I was reading this. I loved Paul! Who cares that it was shallow. It was funny! Sure it isn't typical Steel, but I will continue to read every book she writes, and ESPECIALLY if there are more like this one!!!! Lighten up people!"
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I have read all of Steele's books, and this is by far, without doubt, the worst book I have ever read bar none.As I read the book I felt that she was making fun of her readers (i.e. I can write pure junk and they will still buy it). I absolutely hated the constant references to brand names. I bet she used the words ""Dr. Pepper"" one hundred times in the first three chapters and in later chapters she refers to the ""quadruple flip"" over and over again. How stupid does she think we are?Lastly, the whole klone idea was just ridiculous. There was not one believable idea in this whole book. She has one more chance before I count myself out of her fan base."
2,Who wrote this anyway,"I have read every Steel book at least once and own most of them in hardback. I was surprised that I was able to get this from the library. Now I know why. No one else wanted to read it. It was the worse one she has written. She should stick to history and away from the future. Zoya was one of the best. Ghost was different, but still very enjoyable. Try again, Danielle"
1,The absolute worst steele has ever written,"I have read all d. steele's books and for the most part have enjoyed her earlier books. They were easy and enjoyable reads. What in the world has happened....her last few books have been awful. After reading her last books, I have sworn that I will never read another one again. I wish I had listened to myself and not bothered to read the Klone & I. I did not find it ""wickedly funny"" and the book was full of much unnecesarry repetative narrative...if she mentioned the triple flips one more time...... While her books are always ""easy reads""--lately she seems to be writing at a level directed to readers whom she must feel have a low IQ. C'mon, Danielle, give us little more credit. If you must read this...please don't waste your money..borrow it from a friend or the library."
2,Good bathroom material,"Accept this book for what it is! Just a piece of sci-fi fluff that was probably not meant to be anything but entertaining. This is NOT a book for the romantic reader. It is very farfetched and unrealistic, but I still found a few laughs here and there. Pick it up at a garage sale instead!"
1,What a waste of paper!,"I have never felt disappointed about a Danielle Steel book, however, this book was the dumbest piece of fiction I have ever tried to read, I gave up after 40 pages or so. Ms. Steel shouldn't of wasted her time and ours by writing this. I will be leary about buying her next book."
1,"Too Amateurish, Seemed like an Erotica",This is not the average trash Danielle writes. It was too high-tech for me. I can't believe that she could write something like this. I feel that it was a poor one of her
1,This book is trash.,"If this book was the first one that I had read of Danielle Steeles', I would probably not have ever read another one. Did she write this one herself?"
1,The worst of the worst for Danielle Steel,"This has been her worst book yet. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am definitely a Danielle Steel fan, however, this time she dropped the ball. I'm sorry I paid for this book."
1,Worst book I have ever read,I have read all 50 books and cannot believe the same person wrote this book.
1,A preview to the future????,"When I finished reading this book, I sat for awhile thinking about the way technology has advanced thus far--and laughed when I tried to picture a woman actually living this story. It was funny and relaxing at the end of a long day. I recommend it to all those who enjoy Steel's book. It's refreshing and what I affectionatey call my 'no-brainers'."
1,Not worth Anything,"As an avid fan of all her books, THE KLONE AND I was a huge disappointment. It seemed like it was written by someone else. Characters were poorly developed, the story line was disjointed, and the story provided no sense of closure. It is an insult to her talent and her readers' loyalty.from: Janet L."
1,Don't Read the Book,"I fully understand the need for an author to ""break out"" periodically and follow a new avenue -- but this ""avenue"" is full of pot holes, leaving this reader to wonder who really wrote this book and why it was published. Books like this can make a reader distrust a favorite writer's future work."
1,Where is the suspense...?,This book is a fall from the standard we expect from this author. Where is the suspense and who thought up this wacky computer scheme?
1,1 star- that's what it deserves,"Sorry Danielle, this was the third strike. I will give any author two bad books, but not three. This was so bad I didn't even finish it."
1,I Stopped Reading this Halfway Through,I stopped reading this halfway through when I figured out nothing was happening either plotwise or characterwise. The previous book by Danielle Steel was disappointing as well. It just ended very abruptly. I'm not sure what's going on here -- too much time spending research?
1,Not Up to Par,"She's an excellent author and can do better than this one.Just finished a book club meeting a while ago, we agreed on giving what Steel deserves with this book: bad customer reviews."
1,Steel has sold out on her public,"The book is uneven, written on an elementary school level, has terrible character development, and is utterly predictable, particularly if you've read his books before. Even the protagonist, who potentially can be the most complex character Steel has ever created, is passed off to us as one-dimensional."
5,Excellent!,"It was really HIGH-TECH! I hope Danielle Steel will keep up this level. For example, next book about UFO Love Story! And so on ..."
1,Truly disappointing,"As a proud owner of every Danielle Steel novel ever written, I had read the poor reviews of ""The Klone and I"" but decided to give it a chance and ordered it nonetheless. I should have taken the advice of many readers and critics, and saved myself the expense and effort of having this book shipped across many thousand miles to me. How disappointing! I am only grateful that it was a fast read. The plot is so utterly ludicrous that it fails to be even the least bit entertaining, much less stimulating. Even the most dedicated, devoted, die-hard DS fans like myself would be much better off sitting this one out."
1,"Oh Please, where's the plot?","As a dutiful Danielle Steel reader and avid fan, this book was dissapointing. I really wanted to enjoy this book as much as her others, I really did, but no matter how hard I tried to lie to myself, it didn't work.Please, no more experiments with these odd ball books, go back to the ones you are best at, romance, true romance."
1,"Average, nothing new or spicy","I love Danielle Steel's novels, I've read them all and usually before they come out in paperback. My experience is to read them cover to cover in just a few days because they grab me and suck me into the story. This story, was too unbelievable to be even fun. It was drawn out and boring. The beginning was good, it kept my interest, I wanted to see what would happen next... then the Klone entered the picture and it went down hill from there. The next few chapters basically just replay themselves.I don't recommend this one, but she hasn't lost a fan (yet)."
1,Unreal and Unbelievable,"I found this book to be so unreal and unbelievable that it was hard for me to relate to the story. I felt detatched from the characters and even bored at times. I also thought the main character was a poor representation of a woman, especially for her love life."
1,Prayed for this book to make some sense,"Sadly, there was no sense with this story. It was a piece of garbage, a TRUE waste of perfectly able and capable trees. Why did Danielle Steel have to go out and make a fool of herself with this piece of nothing, It's not even worthy enough to be called a book, or even a novella, or even a short story! I am so fummed about this book, get some sense the next time around please! I want a longer and better book, now!"
1,Disappointed!!!,"I'd like to start this by saying that I'm a fan and am there to buy her books the minute they're available, and I was really looking forward to getting to know more about these new characters.. had enjoyed their arrival in her last book... but WAS SO DISAPPOINTED... it was never really developed and kind of ""I don't know"" what was she going for. from Emmet"
1,A Second Disappointment,"Under most circumstances, I read a Steel novel in one evening -- but not this time. However, it was a completely different type of novel and had it been written by any author other than Steel, I probably would not have bought it. From now on, I'll just wait for the next novel. --3rd Tom"
1,I didn't like this bo ok,"I used to take pride in the fact that I was a Steel fan, but I'm about to jump off the Steel band wagon. I was devasted by the clone and I. I wish this book would never have been published.-Nutcase"
2,Could've Been Better,"I'm a big fan Of Danielle Steel books. The Klone and I was okay but nowhere near comapre dot some of her other works. It actually seemed to get better as the book progressed though. I would say ""Read it - but do not get your hopes up"""
1,Pitiful,"Danielle Steel has a singular, peculiar talent. She can create wealthy, gorgeous characters and sweep you up into their dramas. You really CARE about whether Tiffany gets Reginald in the end, because you sense that Danielle really cares. This book is a pitiful attempt at humor. You sense that she was just sleepwalking through it. When will readers stop buying these silly little short stories that are priced the same as full fledged novels?"
1,far-fetched,This book is an insult to the readers intelligence. How Did Danielle Steele come up with this idea?
1,Actually I'd rate it a minus 10.....,"Without a doubt the absolute worst book I have ever been stupid enough to buy. Intrigued by the incorrect grammar and spelling of the title, I picked it up on a quick run through the grocery store -- and should have left it there. Ms. Steel is clearly desperate to sell -- and quality be damned. She used to weave a pretty good tale, all variations on a theme and totally predictable but the stories made for a good read on a plane trip or a day at the beach. This one is an absolute embarrassment and she should be thoroughly ashamed."
4,Life After Love?,"Moving on from a loved one could be on of the hardest things to do. To start a new life for yourself, a life totally not like the last.In the book The Klone and I the main character Steph was left by her husband when he remarried Helena. After the devastation she began to piece back the remains of her life. Later Steph decided to take a trip to Paris. In Paris life was looking clearer. Steph met a guy named Peter. He wasn't like all the others Steph tried to date. She enjoyed spending her time with him. After a long time, Steph started to see some sunshine breaking through the clouds. This book was a nice change from her usual form of sappy stories, yet I still enjoyed reading this book."
2,"Silly, But Entertaining","No one dies, as they do in most Steele novels, but ""Klone"" is entertaining anyhow. Recommend as an audio listen, not as a read."
5,"Why all the negative reviews, guys?","Hey, I'm sorry but I thought this book was okay. It was very funny and never gets boring. The only disappointment this book had was that it wasn't longer.The book is perhaps not as good as some of her previous books like Vanished and Daddy, but it is still good. Just because the idea of a clone being the main focus of this book is ridiculous doesn't make this a bad book. It was, in fact, a nice and fun book. I really enjoyed it and I'm sure anyone who likes reading fun stuff will enjoy it as well."
2,"Very different, very unlike Danielle Steele",Though I enjoyed it like all the others I found it a little too far fetched and a little hard to believe. They way she normally writes you can see the whole setting and picture the characters easily. This was harder to imagine.
2,Very Disappointing,"I love Danielle Steel's novels, I've read them all and usually before they come out in paperback. My experience is to read them cover to cover in just a few days because they grab me and suck me into the story.This story, was too unbelievable to be even fun. It was drawn out and boring. The beginning was good, it kept my interest, I wanted to see what would happen next... then the Klone entered the picture and it went down hill from there. The next few chapters basically just replay themselves.I don't recommend this one, but she hasn't lost a fan!"
3,Very Different for D.S.,"This is a different way for D.S. to write. I liked that it was in a shorter format than her usual long novels. This is not one of my favorites, but I did enjoy it. I didn't care for the clone plot."
1,Doesn't even deserve one star.,"I make it a point not to read reviews or plot lines before reading books. I want to be surprised. Boy was I surprised. This started out as the typical Danielle Steele book (she tends to get in a rut, but sometimes the old standbys are comforting) but then it went so far askew. The only reason I finished the book was that I was hoping she'd somehow turned it around (like Bobby's dream in Dallas) and redeem herself. No such luck. It's not worth the time."
4,"A break from the norm, refreshing and new.","A long time fan of DS novels, this was definitly something new for her. I didn't think this story of cloneing would catch my attention, but it did. It makes you think if it really is possible. I thought DS did a great job writing on this subject, I didn't think she could pull it off. I was surprisingly impressed. I think is is a book worth buying. Reads fast, short in length, and very funny."
1,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed in this, Ms. Steele's latest book. Coming so soon after ""The Long Road Home"" made it that much more disappointing. The story line and characters are highly unbelievable."
4,A nice break from Danielle Steel's previous novels,"I checked this book out from the library with mixed emotions. I had heard that basically this book sucked. I was wondering if I was going to be wasting my time with this one. Well, I wasn't!! It was a nice break from her other more ""serious"" novels. It is very fantasylike in the way that there is ALOT of shopping (designer stuff, no less) and alot of great sex. I was very happy with the ending. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to take a one hour break from reality. This book was fun....and yet there is some degree of emotion involved. I don't think that I would buy it but I would definitely recommend getting it from the library."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on!,"I have, like so many others, been a fan of D. Steel's for years. I loved how her writing would suck me in time and time again. She had a talent of making me care about her characters and even shed a few tears for them. I feel incredibly insulted by ""The Klone and I"" What I have read from other reviews is that others who are fans of her's feel the same. The individuals who have liked it perhaps aren't great fans of hers. I feel she used her good name to con her readers into buying this book. When you are an author of Steel's caliber you are expected to produce a certain type of quality writing. If you want to try something new... fine... that's what they make pseudonyms for. Obviously she didn't feel this book could make it on it's own. And it couldn't! Perhaps a vacation is in order... get it together Danielle!"
2,Umbelievable,"I have enjoyed everyone of Danielle Steel's books. Her stories always take me far away from my own world. I have to say that this book was not what I expected. I like a story that I can see actually happening. This one was pretty far fetched. I still enjoyed the book, but prefered her first novels."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"I really disliked this book. Not only was it completely improbable, it was very repetetive. Ms. Steel should stay away from sci-fi subjects and stick to romance in a ""normal"" world. I cannot imagine why it was even published, except for the fact that Danielle Steel is a popular author."
1,Game Of Crap,"Lame ""Bruceploitation"" flick that actually succeeds in giving other Bruce Lee knock-offs a bad name. The lead character, adopting Bruce Lee's Chinese moniker, Hsio Lung and looking nothing like him, is asked by ""criminal elements"" (although the lack of anything resembling acting in this flick is the true crime) to star in their movie. Upon refusing, his Caucasian wife is threatened into poisoning him. He is somehow resurrected and goes on to pummel the bad guys in an atrocious rip-off of Game Of Death's pagoda fight. The only scene worth a look is Hsiao Lung ""getting it on"" with Alice. Look closely and see the White Alice mysteriously morph into an Asian body double for the nude scenes:-)Text-book case of El-Cheapo film-making at it's worst."
5,An Edifying Read,Groz's book is just the kind of investment book that has been needed to fill the gap between market kitch and high-brow professional narrative. It leaves the reader feeling well informed but piques her curiousity -- and prepares her for an even deeper understanding of the markets and investing. It is clear that this was Groz's intention. A great book for journeyman investors seeking to negotiate markets and market-speak on a daily basis.
1,Savvy investor?????,It is exactly what you would expect from a magazine. The information provided was basic investing 101 style material. It is more akin to the type of information you would get in a pamphlet rather than a true academic work. If you watch CNBC for 20 minutes per day you will be better informed than you will after reading this book.
1,Nothing New,I read this book and I was just left wondering where the new material was. This book just goes over some general things that everyone knows. We need something a little meatier. Barbara can really be a great leader when she wants to. I just wish she didn't leave these books up to other people such as biographers and ghost writers.
2,Nothing New,"Having read many articles and several books, there was nothing new in this book for the general reader. Lacked substance also."
5,tough read worth the wading,"admittedly a tough read, and i can see why the empircally linearly minded have great difficulty with it. It is after all theology which tends to be difficult to get through when scholarly. What O'Murchu offers is another lens to look at the world and the cosmos that every bit as valid as those more rigid sources. What i dont like about it is that for theology, it lacks foundation . . .is a bit wishy washy. But i gave it five stars because of its audacity and unique approach. We are living in a transitional time of paradigm shifting . . . many disciplines attest to that . . . we need the fresh insights that can be gleaned from those scholars who think and write outside the box. Thank you O'Murchu."
1,make the connection,"Having read perhaps sixty or seventy books concerning quantum phenomena, I was eager to enlarge my horizons with this one. Now that I have read it twice, I am still searching for some indication that the author has found a connection between theology (I grant him expertise in this) and quantum anything. In fact, though it is merely implicit, he makes the naive error of considering the quantum as something large, when semi-informed lay readers know that the quantum is the smallest measurable amount of energy. thebigo@gte.net"
3,"Theos, Thea, or What?","The author does make some interesting arguments. However, I recommend reading the appendicies first as a way of being introduced to the ""theology.""The author is overly steeped in New Age, Femininst, and Anti-Industrial dogma and this seeps into an otherwise interesting view of the theological viewpoint.I prefer the appendicies over the text as it provides a lot of ideas on which to work and think. Overall pretty good but would have been better without the preaching in the text."
5,"Simply the ""BEST""","There is nothing more that I or anyone esle can say about Donna Fargo other than she is ""SIMPLY THE BEST"". Her music has touched more lives than any other performer in Rock, Pop, or Country. I purchased several of her C.D's to give out as gifts. I do indeed hope that, there will be another C.D. out VERY SOON."
5,The best CD I have ever heard!!,"THIS IS INDEED THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD! DONNA FARGO. Her version of ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is awesome.This cd contains some of the biggest songs in country music. I have never met anyone who has not heard Happiest Girl or Funny Face. And both re on this cd. The production on this cd is excellent. Donna shines throughout every song. My favorites are ""Don't Be Angry"",""Whatever I Say"",""You can't be a beacon' and of course the ones mentioned above. SHANIA WAS NOT FIRST. DONNA FARGO STARTED IT ALL IN THE SEVENTIES. Dolly, Loretta and Tammy were good but DONNA FARGO WAS AND STILL IS THE BEST!!"
1,Doesn't hold anything but won't come off wall,"I've bought this previously at local stores, it wouldn't hold light weight wooden letters, repeatedly had them falling off the walls, as well as extremely light music posters, simply had no gripping strength whatsoever. Now here's the kicker, when I went to remove the tape from the wall it won't come off! It sticks to the wall but not to anything else! The gray foam leaves a gray residue if not pieces of the tape when you take it off. Save yourself the trouble and buy a different product."
3,Austrian Music for non-austrian people,I have seen Rainhard Fendrich for the first and only time live in 1985 when I was working in Austria. I loved his music especially the Austrian Dialect and am looking for every new album ever since this date. Blond is the last album I have bought and I must say: Fendrich as great as always! Pop and folk music mixed as one. Great music and a great singer! I am already looking for his next album to come out! I am probably the only dutch person having his music!
2,DER HIT-MIX DAS ALBUM - ROLAND KAISER,"Roland Kaiser's voice and Music are still a joy to listen to, the CD is very disapointing. They cramed 32 songs ( short versions ) on one CD. It's something if you want to open a Disco and have a Roland Kaiser evening. I buy my Music because of my long commute to/from work. This is not a joy to listen to. I have to buy a new CD, that I can have the complete versions, and can enjoy, now I am out the money for this one. I paid 16.49. I would have been happy to pay an extra $ 5.00 to get a double CD set with the complete versions."
3,Doesn't do justice to the artist's work,"Here's an excellent singer in a lousy production: The background disco-beat makes all the songs sound the same and makes them too fast. There is nothing relaxing or inspirational about this album. I don't mind that all the songs are short, they just don't sound good produced this way."
1,Boring,"I got about half way through before deciding to turn this horrible film off. Upon reading some very positive reviews i decided to finish the rest. What a waste of time. I spent most of my time wondering if I was watching the same film as other reviewers. This movie is boring, and a complete waste of time. Its not funny at all, just completely lame. I would suggest watching anything else that you can find instead of this film. BTW, I am a big low budget b grade horror fan. This is just garbage. There is one decent scene at the end involving a hatchet and a chainsaw, but it is nothing special and is not worth watching the rest of the movie for."
1,Rancid Turd,"This film is advertised as 'terrifying and funny' but fails to do either. The movie creeps along at a snail's pace, with haphazard, obviously impromptu dialogue. Additionally, there are none of the redeeming B-movie qualities present: no nudity, no great special effects, and no worthwhile villian. At the end of this very boring movie, I was glad most of the principle characters were dead, thus alleviating any serious worries that a sequel could be on its way. The awfulness of this film will linger like a ripe fart."
2,2.5 for effort but ungrounded and poorly paced,"Take the decent premise of a black invitation to a MURDER PARTY blowing down the street and someone picking it up and alot of ideas come to mind.I kind of expected what follows but to its credit the movie isn't entirely predictable or tiresome. The drug addled exploits and dialogue of the main characters are mildly entertaining if not overtly self aware and hyper hip low budget versions of your average Bret Easton Ellis college kids trying to mimic Man Rey and the idea of ""murder as art""It feels like a decent staged student film in the end however despite a crank eating canine, several effective old school eighties F/X injuries and an unlikely death by pumpkinbread. I didn't feel like I completely wasted my time with this one and it has an okay HALLOWEEN (the holiday vibe) it just isn't compelling, believable or funny enough to recommend it to anyone or to watch it over again."
4,"In My Top 5, Hands Down","I won't say much about it... but if you like gore - it's here. If you like comedy, it's here. If you like off the mainstream, its here. This movie is fun and clever. Way to go."
3,Murder Party,The concept of the movie is better than the way it actually plays out but over all I liked it.
1,"This ain't no ""Shaun of the Dead"".","Great beginning. Decent ending. This is a party you can miss though. It's the middle part of the movie I fell asleep during and had to go back and watch. Nice work, great camera shots and effects for an indy film. I'm just not much into a movie that centers around a bunch of dope heads sitting in a circle for a long time in a warehouse and talking nonsense.If Shaun of the Dead and Napoleon Dynamite did meet during a Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it ended up being anything like Murder Party I don't think they would tell anybody. I know they wouldn't break any box office records.If you do get the movie and watch the ""making of"" extra you can't help but like the kids that put this movie together. They've been making home movies since the 80s and now they are living their dream. Their dream puts me to sleep but I guess in that way they've helped me achieve at least one of my dreams."
3,Funny with friends,"I saw this at the 2007 Maryland Film Festival and it was a riot. To quote another reviewer it was more of a comedy than horror, but it didn't skimp on the blood. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I saw it alone or with one friend. This movie is better with a group. Perfect for a movie party and such. I can see this becoming a modern day ""Rocky Horror""."
3,Better than I expected,"On the minus side, it appears to have been filmed on a cell phone, the sound was processed in an underwater echo chamber and the subtitles were created by someone who is clearly not a native English speaker. And there's a scene in blackface which keeps referring to African-Americans as negroes. On the plus side, Kaneshiro Takeshi. And it's a sort of charming window into lowbrow Hong Kong humor. Did I mention Kaneshiro Takeshi?"
1,Outrageous quality,"As someone mentioned already, you can't make much of the movie, as you can't hear, what they are talking about, as there are two sound tracks playing together, and subs are taking one third of the screen, as they are both english and chinese together and you can't switch them off. Otherwise the movie is okay, typical for that time and aim, so it's quite funny sometimes (in the good way), and sometime just silly - would get three stars, if you can see it at all. But stay away from this companys' products!!! For your own sake!"
1,Uggghhhhh,"Such a great movie, but a horrible DVD release. The picture quality is awful and the sound is even worse. DO NOT BUY!"
5,fahrenheit 451,I seem to recall some years ago that critics ratedthis sound track as one of Herman's best. The main theme is classic Herman. I like this sound track because it is consistant. I recomed that any fansof Herman's music should always try if availableto purchase his original soundtracks in tack withthe master conducting the orchestra.
5,Definitive study; incisive; dramatic; accurate.,"Not only is this the definitive study of combined ops in the CW, it is the definitive study of George McClellan, the grand strategist of 1861/62 and the only general in the war who maximized naval cooperation. Her insights are brilliant and her premature death is much to be regretted."
4,Well-researched; clear tactical discussions; goes too far,"This work is enormously well-researched, and contains clear, concise tactical and strategic discussions. Reed, however, goes too far in trying to establish McClellan as the author of joint strategy for the war. Apart from the general conclusions, quite a useful tool for researchers and students of military history."
1,"All Hat, No Cattle","Caveat emptor: I bought this book in order to scan the section on Vicksburg, so my comments only pertain to that portion of the book.After scanning the section on Vicksburg, I was not tempted in any way to read the rest of the book. She was consistently wrong on nearly every aspect of the Vicksburg Campaign ... from the placement of the fortifications at Chickasaw Bayou (they were NOT on top of the hills, Rowena) to Grant's grand plan of operations when he set foot on dry soil at Milliken's Bend (we see in the Papers of Ulysses S. Grant that he intended all along to move south of the city). Major gaps exist in the O.R. material for this period, and Rowena fills in these gaps with hateful vitriol. I'm not sure what her game is, but it is not history."
1,Give Me a break Already,"This book is a joke. It should be filed under humor. It was actually funny in some parts. The main character cries for all her pain, and it is so obvious that its all self inflicted. The poor dear if she needed to get out of her bad realtionship, all she had to do was stop being a witch. I fell sick that I even read this book. Put it in the trash."
1,Why Oh Why do we have to suffer,This is the saddest book I ever did read. How could a person be tortured so much by her family. Betrayed does not even begin to explain how the main character was dealt with. The writing was so vivid it seemed as if I could smell the stench of June perfume. The character development was deep. June suffered so her family could succed. I only wish this was a true story so I could give June a big hug and tell he it is all going to be ok. I hope Ms Gavin never writes another book she will never be able to top this wonderful pamphlet book.
1,a tragedy for the print industry.,"A poorly written story, the text is overly melodramatic and uninteresting. had the author made an attempt at developing her characters, it might have been less of a waste of my time to read.As it stands, the work is flat and pathetic. The main character is portrayed as a helpless victim throughout her poor little rich girl travels, never learning how to cope with the important people in her life.This book is a terrible waste of paper, ink & glue."
1,"Tragic, AND vindictive","The book shows only the most negative and distored actions of the characters, not interaction with the author. Without any positive intervention. The only action taken by the author was to remake the characters the male romantic characters into her own standards, rather than to work out any problems or difficulties. There is no representation of the authors interaction during these situations. Certainly, since the first incidents took place in the 60's, it is clear that there was never and attempt to listen, forgive, or forget.The venom is that of the author's. This is not fiction, dispite the disclaimer. Only the names and places where changed."
1,Will not run and Amazon will not help,I received this program and loaded it into my Mac Book. The software gives an error message when starting up and cannot use. I tried to contact Amazon but they do not answer and make it very difficult to find them. I had no option but to begin a dispute through American Express.A waste of time and money.
4,A good addition,The game add interesting and elaborate scenarios plus new leaders and civilizations.For lovers of Civi it's a must have.
5,the best cd i own,this is the best cd i own and i listen to it everyday. If no one has this u need to go out and buy it now.
5,Wonderful,Donna has some wonderful lyrics in her songs and are down to earth and timeless Thank you for bringing it back again.
4,Authentically Bleak Mineral Palace,"I read this book because I grew up, in the 40's, a few blocks from the real Mineral Palace. In that Pueblo Colorado of the post-depression, the rotting building had been closed and sealed. The image that the book develops -- of the town and the palace -- while fictionalized and exagerated, evokes a feel and spirit that came back to me as I read.Now I wonder whether all small industrial towns were like that in the 30's and 40's."
4,Excellent Book,"I read the previous reviews posted and was surprised at the some of the negative comments. I really don't understand how a work of FICTION can be criticized for inaccuracies. But I won't dwell. Ms. Jalavits paints a bleak picture, one sure to disturb some readers. But it certainly is enjoyable and rewarding reading when judged on whether it is well-written, interesting, compelling and moving. With the warning that this is not a warm-and-fuzzy remembrance, I would recommend this book to any intelligent, emotionally mature reader."
2,"Yaddo, Yaddo, Yaddo","I almost used the title: How many gratuitous dead babies does it take to make a bestseller? Offensive? Yes. But not entirely inaccurate. This is not your ""feel good summer beach read.""This is the kind of book that comes out of writers' workshops. Overwrought and over-long with symbolism overwhelming story at every turn of page.Mineral Palace is bleak and tedious. Too many plot points end up being pointless. And how do such cardboard characters withstand such raging duststorms?As a work of fiction, I don't care whether this is an accurate depiction of Pueblo in the 30s. I do care that I was lured into this town with the promise of a good story and left with just a few stunning images (The Buffalo Mass Suicide)."
1,UGH!,"I'd been wanting to read this book since I read Ms. Julavits' article in Poets & Writers about the criticism she received for this work and the importance of getting historical fiction right.So...I started reading and would agree that it began nicely--though, at some point I couldn't figure out where the story was going and then I realized: Jeez. Is there even a story? In searching, I could find no great conflict, drama, or even mild tension. Nothing propelled this drivel. And so, after 243 pages, I called it quits (and believe me, I HATE giving up on a novel).Julavits is a so-so author. Some of her sentences read very nicely. Still, I just have to wonder, what on Earth inspired her to write this? What was the inspiration? Was she writing genre fiction, keeping a frame around her story of ""women's historical fiction"" or did she actually think that this idea was unique?I'll read Julavits again, only if the story itself seems clever.Shame on her for publishing such a mindless bore."
3,"Bleak, But Beautifully Written First Novel","Nothing can thrive in Pueblo, Colorado, the town in which Bena and her family move when her physician husband's past deprives him of employment in more hospitable towns. New-born kittens are, upon closer inspection, writhing with maggots, mangy dogs have their backs broken by defiant vagrants who refuse to share their meals, and buffalos inexplicably opt for mass suicide. The human inhabitants of Pueblo do not escape misery -- women are barren, except for a prostitute addicted to laudanum, Bena's infant fails to thrive despite her husband's insistence that the child is healthy, and Bena's marriage flounders.The author skillfully evokes the despair and decay of a town that is blanketed with dust and populated with characters who are sad and pathetic. This is a difficult book to read but, like a traffic accident, it is impossible to look away and the images remain with the reader long after the story concludes."
2,Disappointing,"I kept hoping this book would redeem itself. Line after line, page after page I was disappointed. The writing wasn't bad but the story itself simply did not work. It was as if the author tried to force every scene and character into some bizarre and glum mold. I enjoy many genres and have read tragic but compelling stories. The only tragedy about this one is that I wasted time reading it."
4,Compelling and haunting but a tad overdone,"I couldn't put this book down. Bena is a complex and believable character, and her psychological journey is spookily mirrored by the barren landscape and the unpredictable weather she faces in Pueblo, Colorado of the 1930s. I wonder, though, if the symbolism isn't a bit too much; in some ways, I think the book might have been stronger without the overdrawn picture of the abandoned and rotting mineral palace. Still, the author deals with many essential questions about the nature of male-female relationships and the limits on honesty in such a relationship. A great book for a book club discussion!"
1,Mineral Palace,"This book was so filled with erroneous information that I couldn't focus on the author's craftsmanship. Although this was an Oprah book and received excellent critical reviews I was extremely offended by Miss Julavits' lack of responsible research. She wrote a book about a real town and real people but she distorted the facts. I lived in the town in l934 when the book was set and there was no resemblance to the actual town of Pueblo, Colorado or the people who lived there. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,A reader,"Ms Julavits should have, at least, visited Colorado prior to writing this novel. I am a native of Colorado Springs and found the description of that area very objectionable. Her description of Pueblo was even worse. Perhaps had I not been from this area I may have found the book to be a fair read--but perhaps not. The characters just weren't believable. I purchased the book because I wanted to read a book about the history of Pueblo. I knew it was a novel, but the majority of (good) historical novels have some basis in reality. I was very disappointed that this one did not."
1,"some truth, please?","...another book hyped by pal Dave Eggers here on Amazon, a site glitch revealed last year. I wonder which reviews are his; anyone know? This review spotting could be more fun than the book: look, there's hubby Ben Marcus's review! And pal/co-editor Vendela What's-her-name! Ooh--first one to spot Zadie Smith's wins! I just love this bold new 'indy' alternative to publishing."
1,Missing her trademark,"Julavits is certainly an unusual author. She's not the best at making believable, relatable characters, and she doesn't quite succeed in pulling the reader in to the story -- usually you feel more like a disjointed spectator.However, she does a fabulous job of playing these little mind games with you that make you question your own reality, question people's motives, and ultimately makes the book almost an interactive experience to the text because your interpretation of events affects the story that takes place.She did an excellent job of this in The Effect Of Living Backwards, and a decent job in The Uses of Enchantment. Unfortunately, this book contained the shortcomings of her writing without the strengths. You still feel a lack of empathy for the characters and a disjointedness from the setting, but the story is missing her trademark psychological elements. I guess it didn't become her trademark until later."
4,Nice Sturdy Perch,"This perch is well made and holds my Eclectus without a problem. The suction cups needed to be set in the sun for a couple of days to ""re-shape"" because of warping during shipment, but other than that it showed up in perfect condition.One cool feature of this perch is that the bottom part (the perch part that the bird sits on) will swing to the side so it's flush against the wall, making it easy to leave in place without poking your eye out when you try to shower. The photo is red, mine showed up a glittery purple...whatever, it works well so I don't care much about the color, but if that is important to you, you might want to contact the seller and request a specific color."
5,The way to learn Latin,"The Wheelock Series is simply the best. After being a Classicist for well over 20 years, I still use them myself and recommend them to anyone who is SERIOUSLY interesting in the language. Experience has shown that the traditional methodology of learning grammar and syntax is still the best. Don't waste your time or money on the New Age warm and fuzzy propaganda of 'see and say'. Learn Latin the correct way, and it is a treasure which you will have for a lifetime."
2,a good attempt but not a good artwork,"The artist, 18 when producing this debut wordless novel, attempts to depict the situations of the dehumanized, angry citizen under sadistic regime in the industrial wasteland. It is a good try but the artwork is a bit dull and flat in most of the pieces. One star for the attempt and another for the idea."
4,Pretty good book for the A-Body fans,"Not a ton of info you probably don't already know, but it's a good reference book"
4,Wee felted folks are cute,"Yes, wee felted folk are cute. The book shows variations on the felted characters, but I'm not 100 % sold on them. Yeah they're cute and small and very easy to make, but I'm a little stumped as to their sellability."
3,Not what I expected.,"Given Sally Mavor's fame as a 3-D storyboard artist, this one is a disappointment. There's nothing in it on making the type of wood and fabric storyboards seen in books she illustrates. Just endless tiny fairies which, basically, all look alike. Cute, but without the lush outdoor backgrounds against which they were photographed, they're uninspiring."
3,should be sold as 3 volumes,"The content is fine. The packaging, however, is obese and pretentious. Recommend cutting it into more manageable sections: 3 volumes in 3."
3,lol. you're wrong,"this game is NOT being discovered because everyone knows it's just like CoH with different powers and costumes. this game is just as repetitive as CoH. Every mission is still the same...gee, who would have thought! WoW is still the most fun MMOPRG there is. There is no satisfaction here of killing an extremely tough boss but in WoW there is (lots of epic loot :D). I'll still play CoV here and there if i'm not raiding in WoW. The good things about this game I suppose are the graphics, power effects, costume design. It's OK."
4,More More MORE! A Very Good Game!,"Ok, I was going to write a long review here, but just read the reviews above (featured reviews). They pretty much say it all. This game is alot of fun. I'm a long time comics reader and tried other online games, but this is the only one I've played with any interest for any length of time.CoV adds lots of content, more missions and better costume choices for your bad guys. I have been enjoying it and find it alot of fun!"
2,Must have internet connection,"This game is very fun to play. But you must have an internet connection in order to play it period. Description made it seem like you only needed it for online gameplay, but you need it period to even run the game and it costs $14.99 per month just play it. So it only get's two stars overall. I'm not an online gamer, so I found this to be very disappointing because I'm fan of the City of Heroes series."
4,good!!,"Have you ever wanted to play a villain? Than this game is for you!! City of Villains (CoV) is essentially an expansion of NC Soft's previous hit game, City of Heroes (CoH). But the it can stand alone and be played without purchasing the first game."
2,It didn't WoW me,"I was looking to take a break from world of warcraft and decided to give city villains a try... 2 weeks later I reactivated my warcraft account. I found the CoV gameplay to be extremely repetitive and chaotic. I also found the amount of supergroup/team spammed invites without so much as a 'hey' in-game tell to be infinitely bothersome. Maybe under different circumstances I could have enjoyed it - but it just didn't match up to world of warcraft... If I need to repetitevely kill the same things over and over and over again, I'd like to at least do it in a game where I can always move to a different setting and refresh the experience."
1,City of Villians,"NC Soft the company that runs the game is a bunch of idiots.I bought the game and used the free trial peroid to check it out .I decided I liked it so I paid for three months of game time.After that I never could log on , after several weeks of e-mails with the company I gave up , there idiots asking me questions like are my cap locks off. I'll never buy antoher NC soft product again."
1,Absolutely horrible.,"Cheating: The administrators of the game cheat for certain players and are don't enforce their own in-game rules unless more than 5 people complain.Gameplay: The game is designed so that it takes forever to level, literally weeks for one level after level 20 (max is 50).Performance: The game itself is highly intrusive, uses incredible amounts of memory, cpu, hard-disk space (4+gigs) and has many known issues with most graphics cards.Harassment: There is a lot of solicitation for joining various supergroups, a lot of unwanted invitations. Many people run around asking you for sex on this game if you play a female character.FEES: There is virtually NO technical support. It costs $15 per month to play this game, even after you buy it. Most people know this, but I do know one person who bought this game without realizing that.Bottom line: World of Warcraft is MUCH better. Heck, Warcraft III/TFT is better than this."
1,this game is bad,"in WOW you can level up get armor and stuff like that, but in this game you only get powerthingies and your gudged by your looks and power thingies. i would strongly recomend to play WoWinstead of CoV"
5,well made and cute,"I agree that the sizes run a tad small. With that in mind, I ordered 12-18 months for my healthy sized 9 month old, and she definitely has room to grow. well made, thick, and vibrant colors. And very well priced!"
2,Did I actually get BabyLuxe?,"Hi. I was very excited about getting some shirts for my daughter, but when I received the ten shirts I ordered I was a little upset that they had no tags on them and the second tag on the inside of the shirt was cut from all the shirts. The invoice stated that to return any items they had to be new, but how could they be returned if they did not come with tags? Also, the fact that one of the inside tags was cut makes me think that these shirts are not Babyluxe brand, but some other brand that you, as the seller, acquired and jacked up the price.I will be posting this same comment as a review of your item because I think buyers need to be aware of what they are really getting.The shirts are cute, but it makes me wonder if I received what I really bought."
2,somewhat entertaining but poorly written,"Well, I just got back from a trip to Rome and read this book on the plane. Yes, at times it was funny --- as the other reviewers have noted. Yes, I learned some things about the Vatican I didn't know before. But the book is also disjointed, repetitive, poorly edited, and written in a style that was wordy, manipulative of the reader, and with barely veiled sexism in his repeated references to the physical appearance of the women he sees or meets. I had the impression the author was just trying to fill enough pages to make it book length. It was not a pager turner."
4,Grande Nostaglia,"I found this book thoroughly enjoyable. I travelled to Italy in my teens several times with my Uncle who was a priest. We visited the Vatican often however there are some areas that I was not privy to during my Uncle's personalized tours of Rome. My Uncle was a linguist and flawless in Italian but he neglected to escort me to certain areas below St Peter's. These very trips I took with him endeared me to Italy and it's culture. If you remember experiencing il sciopero, Piazza Navona and gelato you will love this book.It makes you want to book a ticket a' Roma presto presto. This would be a pleasure to re- visit some places you have visited and some places you wish you visited during your student days. Godere."
4,Observations of a (temporary) Roman,"Living in Rome (I even work for the Vatican), I found the 1998 version (subtitled ""An Unofficial Guide to the Vatican"") a very pleasant read, with many of the same wry observations I myself have made on more than one occasion. The author provided me with an entertaining experience, and I was also inspired by his evident love of the Catholic Church, despite all the superficial evidence to the contrary. Although I have lived here for about a year and a half now, I learned some interesting tidbits about places I walk by every day, and laughed out loud on more than one page. The book is now making the rounds of all my American friends in Rome. In fact, I received it as a gift from another temporary Roman!"
5,This book is as essential as a street map when in Rome.,"Mr. Hutchinson's book was reviewed in the travel section of the San Francisco Chronicle just before our trip. It is a delight. Written with wit and excellent journalistic inquiry, it opened for me the inner doors to this wonderful city and let me peek behind the scenes. While the author presents a somewhat irrevent picture he never compromises the faith...only the faithful! Even if you are not going to Rome, you will find this insightful little book great reading."
4,A good Reid..but not her best,"From the Back: Giancarlo Cardinale was determined to have his revenge. He thought Natalia Deyton had slept with his sister's husband. His passionate Sicilian nature demanded a vengeful seduction - and total surrender. But Giancarlo wasn't prepared for the innocence shining out of Natalia - or the sensual power of her stunning beauty. He knew he was falling in love for the first time - but family came first. He had no choice but to carry out his plan.I enjoyed this book, but not as much as other Reids. I guess I did not like how it strayed from her typical format of separated couple, so that the story begins with some previous backstory. With no previous story between the two, I felt their intense passion was rather rushed.It was still a great book. If possible, I would have given 4 1/2 stars."
3,I agree with the reviewer who said...,"...""this is a good Reid, but (definitely) not her best"", not anywhere near her best! The intense passion between the H/H WAS way too rushed; it's sexy enough, but not believable at all. (I like a little realism even in a Harlequin!) I would only give this effort a grade C.Not a keeper; not terrible, but it has a typical formula Harlequin plot with a H/H both overwhelmingly attractive & attracted to each other...not at all what I expected from the author of ""The Price of a Bride"" (which was fantastic)."
5,Best book of its kind,"Of all the books I've read on the subject of psychology and Christianity, this one is the best by far. Despite the first impression from the title, this book is not an inflammatory diatribe. It is a careful, documented look at the origins and promises of psychology and whether psychology is truely a science or simply another religion. The Bobgans make a compelling case against psychology -- whether it is secular psychology or that psychology which claims to be Christian."
3,Not what you think it is,"I got this because I love this movie and because the slow sensual music they lay in it would make for a great romantic evening with my husband. Boy was I surprised!! It is mostly music from the street bands in New Orleans! There is almost none of the music you actually remember hearing in the movie.If you want the romantic setting music just buy the first Pure Moods album, it has all the songs played in this movie and a few extras."
1,Street Fighter- the Motion Picture album,"My big brother loves just one track- as we are UK residents, I have to say that we got SOMETHING THERE in our album (The track my brothers hooked on.). The rest are pretty dire.I love the film, got it on video and it's great. I wish I could say that about the music though...."
1,Disappointed,"Don't waste your time reading the entire book. The book makes some good points, but as in other Spencer Johnson works, they are sparse with filler in between. Fortunately, the author was kind enough to place several summary pages throughout the book.Save time and money:1. Get the book from the library or a friend.2. Read pages 55, 74 and 100."
1,"liked the convience, not the quality",3 out of 4 books were hopefully ok but the copy i kept to re-read broke apart when i turned the pages. i hope the ones i sent for gifts were better than the copy i kept...will see what the recipients say and repost if their experience was like mine.
5,"""GRITTY LIFE OF A NYC PARAMEDIC""","Most civilians will beleive a Medic's life is all guts and glory until they read this book. Several stories about a Medic's life on the streets trying to do the best he can to help people, but is hindered at every turn, by drug using partners, a Fire Department cover up of it's own fatal accident scene, and sticky fingered ambulance personel, among other heart wrenching stories. Read this book and see how life was like for a honest Paramedic struggling to save his fellow man."
3,It's OK,"The item that showed up was gold platted unlike the product image. That was a nice surprise. However, the length of the connector (Almost 1.5 inches behind the faceplate) made it very difficult to install. The combined length of both the connector and the end of the S-Video cable made it impossible to install inside a normal wall without almost breaking the faceplate and putting a serious bend in the cable. It works fine once installed."
1,"STOP, GO BACK!","Bought it to add to my collection. It belongs in a waste can. Unlimited Beat has a very poor understanding of the PSB sound, and no grasp whatsoever of the English languange. Avoid! Avoid! I would never play this in my club, even if all the PSB albums in the world suddenly disappeared. I'd read lyrics over a microphone first. Or better, let my dog."
1,AMAZON.COM PLEASE!,"Why do you (amazon.com) insist on putting these poor imitations with the artists? If you do, at least you could do is say ""NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS"" you are doing your customers a disservice by letting them think that they are getting a ""MEGAMIX"" of their favorite artist--such as the ones we hear at the dance clubs. PLEASE, do your customers a favor and refrain from putting these TRASHY cd's with the original artist and put them where they belong--FAKE ARTISTS! BY THE WAY--HOW ABOUT A ""NO STAR"" rating--this CD doesn't even deserve ""1 STAR""!"
1,Horrible!!,"This is NOT the Pet Shop Boys. Recordings this poor rarely make it out of bootleg street markets in Hong Kong. Clearly for the people who recorded this, English is not their primary tongue. Avoid this CD like the plague!"
1,Piling on,"I bought this CD, listened to it once and than threw it in the trash. I'd rather listen to karaoke versions of the PSB tunes because those people are at least trying and want to impress somebody. I have no idea what these guys (Unlimited Beat) were going for and I have not shed one tear over this CD being gone."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is an utterly aweful release that features an Italian lead singer attempting to cover Pet Shop Boys' tunes. It should be listed as a comedy album. An example of how ""Suburbia"" is murdered:""Let take ride, runs with de dog tonight...""It really is laughable. I spent $7.99 on it, and I feel violated and dirty for even having it on my shelf. Trust me, even if you're a PSB completist (as I am), your collection doesn't need to be THIS complete."
1,Really bad choice!!!!!!,I have been a PSB fan for years.....this album is horrible. Sorry I bought it.//Patrick
1,Don't even bother,I purchased this because of the good reviews. I suffer from allergies and I have a congested nose most of the time.I just tossed the few tablets left in the trash.
5,The most consistent a-ha album,"I think this is the most consistent albums a-ha has made and my personal favorite. A great deal of the tracks have the atmospheric qualities that made ""Scoundrel Days"" such a special album. At times you can actually smell the rain on the songs ""Crying In The Rain"" and the also lovely ""Rolling Thunder"". It contains beautiful, emotional songs such as ""Early Morning"" and ""Slender Frame"". If this album doesn't stir something in you, you aren't human!"
3,kind of rock,"This is a good album, the pop songs are good. But I prefer the sound of the first two albums which sounded more synthy. A-ha were famous for melding the synth with the guitare. On this LP that really doesn't happen."
2,I can't believe the 5 stars on this album,"This album is terrible and a far cry from ""Hunting High and Low"" and ""Scoundrel Days"". This album was the nail to a-ha's coffin. They lost the magic out of this one and dont be surprised if US did not give it any airplay for a lot of the songs are not listenable. I brought this one for I had their first 3 CDs and was hoping something good out of it. 5 stars? Give me a break. Before you buy this album be sure you like their first 3."
1,"East of Good Music, West of Enjoyable","This was a poor effort by a-ha. You can tell by its sales ranking: The Rockwell Box Set did better. The only thing that makes this CD look good is by compairing it to their new CD, Analogue, which should be sold with an apology to all a-ha fans. A-ha got lazy, and greedy on this one. A-ha got back on track with Lifelines and most certainly, Minor Earth/Major Sky. But East of the Sun, West of the Moon, no good."
5,Let musicians make music,"This is my favorite A-ha CD, and I have all of them. This one proves they're real musicians that don't need to hide behind technology. I'm sure that a lot of people are gonna be put out by this transitional work, specially if you have only heard ""take on me"".But this eclectic mix of Pop, hard rock, jazz, and ballads accentuated by a beautiful haunting cover of ""Crying in the Rain"" is just perfection."
5,Excellent,"This is my favorite A-HA CD. Great songs, big/rich sound, great singing. Have to say this CD is in the top 10 of my entire cd collection. Although every A-HA CD is excellent in my opinion, this one has something about it which is special."
3,Average,"A few good songs on this one. Not my favorite, but not my least favorite of their work either."
5,A surprising tour de force,"This album was the one that turned me into an a-ha fanatic - I found it by accident, at a local record store, and picked it up out of sheer curiosity. I was not disappointed - in fact, I was utterly amazed. This CD features a gorgeous, stripped-down sound (in comparison to their earlier work). It begins with a cover of the Everly Brothers' ""Crying In The Rain"", which is the perfect showcase for Morten Harket's voice (one of the most unique and powerful instruments in pop music). The rest of the album lives up to the promise of the first song, from dark, acoustic sound of the title track, to the rock vibe of ""Slender Frame"" and the slightly more pop sounds of ""Waiting For Her"". The whole album is beautiful, and quite surprising ... the first few times I listened to it, I was captivated by the differing sounds each song displayed.I love the first few a-ha albums, but this is the one that proved exactly what they were capable of. A must-own for even the most casual of fans!"
4,Boss 1600DCD,"Thank god someone out there made this, it has helped me in many ways, the huge book that comes with it is a good reference but if I had to read every single page I'd still be reading it.Thanks for making these great tutorial video's.Saucyjack;)Canada"
5,Great book,"Excellent for someone who knows a bit already about the industry as it nicely goes into detail of all aspects you possibly want to know/need to know. For newbies I'd recommend to start with D. Passmans ""All you need to know about the music Business"" and the straight to this one. The only downside is that you actually start to pity 99% of all artists on MTV after reading it, haha!"
2,better options,"maybe i'm just too optimistic about the music business, but this book is a bummer. just is not a fun read. if you want a good scope of the music industry, go with donald passman's book instead"
1,not very good indications,"Please research first, instructions are not clear at all, and once I got this, I figured out this is for SER versions only.."
1,Don't even bother.,"Twenty years ago Lara was an art student dating one brother, but really lusting for the other brother. Now she returns to her old haunts where she knows she will met up with Jake, the brother she always wanted. There really isn't enough plot to keep this story going for 250+ pages. The sex scenes are not very hot, and the whole thing turns out to be dull and contrived. Lara is either drunk or on drugs through half the book. And, why is she sleeping with every Tom, Dick, & Harry.There are a lot of good Black Lace boos, but this isn't one of them."
1,A dull trip down memory lane,"Ok for erotica the book does have numerous somewhat steamy scenes since our heroine, Lara, seems to be always on the verge of masturbating and/or asking for someone to put it in quick....Lara, after 20 years has decide to go to an art school, wherelse but in a remote hidewaway in the English countryside. She's looking to rekindle lust for an artist from her younger years.I guess if I suffered from attention deficit disorder I would have enjoyed this book because none of the erotic scenes seem to ever come to a logical conlusion, but rather, the reader is ripped away to another scene ......."
3,"Dark and brooding most of the time, but Greg is great","I found the trouble with this book is the three male relationships go off the boil. She has fabulous Greg and he just sort of dwindles. Then just when she I about to get her dream come true with Jake, his brother Steve arrives and she jumps right back onthe merr go round with him. finally,only when she has practically killed herself doe Jake admit how he feels about her.A lot of what jake does is not hands on, so to speak, but the toher two men are hot.Lots of dramatic tension, but as an erotic novel, not really.As the other people have said, she is stoned a lot of the time and maudlin and sentimental. she lives in a shadow world of her own making and Jake is never allowed the chance to do or say anything to explain himself.the erotic potential Greg represents in freeing her from her cocoon and letter her be a gorgeous butterfly could have been explored better as well.No real summer fever, more like a sand trap."
4,Genre-bending,"If you like Massive Attack, the Verve ""Remixed"" series or any of the Eighteen Street Lounge Soundtracks, you will sooo dig this disc!"
5,Feel like dancing naked under palm trees?,"Get dressed if you don't want to do it naked, dancing you will. It's a marvellous piece of 'subtropicbeachclubbing'. Deephouse from the likes of Atjazz, Ian Pooley, Fred Everything, Arsenal etc. to give you the right summer feeling. It's hard to believe that this beachclubbing-gem comes from Holland (it always rains). Global warming will absolutely occur when cd-s like this keep being released. Get your convertible in gear!"
5,A very pleasant nostalgia trip,"I ordered this CD solely because I wanted to hear ""Abergavenny,"" a song I adored when I was in elementary school. I didn't even pay much attention to what other tracks were on the disc--I was just thrilled to find the one song I'd been looking for. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover quite a few other sixties oldies that I remember hearing in childhood, but had long since forgotten their existence. No musical masterpieces here, but lots of ""happy nostalgic"" tunes for those of you over 35."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME CD,if you are a NSYNC fan you must have this . I collect every NSYNC CD . SO BUY IT NOW !!
2,Read her original writings,"I have read her original books and they are fabulous. Much better than The Secret.One reviewer commented that this book taught things such as accepting homosexuality, reincarnation, and others. This book was clearly modernized by the editors as her original writings do not contain any of that. I recommend that you read her works as she originally wrote them. The wording is old fashion but very understandable. I recommend her work to people of all faiths."
5,Number 1 Book in my collection!,"Easy reading and nice size print. I am so grateful a friend recommended this book to me. I now understand why she wouldn't let me borrow her copy. My book is full of highlighting and ear tagged pages! You won't want to give your book up either. This book is full of tools that can change even aspect of your life!!! My friends that I have recommended the book to, are calling with incredible success stories in their business. I work on my mantras and casting burdens every morning on my walks. My health has greatly improved. I feel happy! For the first time in my life I feel balanced. She was truly ahead of her time!"
2,Don't be mislead,"Although, there are some good things to learn from this book, I got rather bored with the hammering home of the power of positive thinking. Also, I was under the impression from the friend who recommended the book that the book contained Christian values. It does, but it also contains ""spiritual"" values that are not mainstream Christian teaching, such as accepting homosexuality, reincarnation, and others. I just think it fair to warn someone looking for fundamental Christian literature, that this is definitely not what they are looking for."
5,Before her time,"Shinn gives the new thought message in a direct way. There is so much here, and is applicable to today. Unlike the positive thinking alone, Shinn links it together with a spirituality that is full of potential. Her stories show how we make our own reality"
3,A interesting read and insight into the life and times,"Enjoyed this book, especially the focus given to the changing relationship between Alexander Hamilton and Jefferson over the years. Enjoyed learning about the relationship between Jefferson, Madison and Monroe.Good background and insight into the forming of the first political parties (Federalists and Republicans) as well as insight into the political tactics and ""spin"" each party used to advance it's agenda. Many parallels are evident to the political tactics used by the Democratic and Republican parties of today."
2,The Bureaucrat of Monticello,"In this book Noble Cunningham has managed to make one of the most fascinating figures in American history pedestrian. He provides a dutiful recounting of the facts of Jefferson's life, but never makes him come alive. His thesis--that Jefferson saw the use of reason as the highest human undertaking--is certainly valid, but Jefferson was a man of enormous contradictions, none of which are truly explored here. This book makes the man who said ""Democracy ought to be periodically washed in blood"" seem like a hardworking civil servant."
2,An average biography (Two and half stars),"This book is a fairly good introduction to Jefferson, although it is rather short for a biography of one of our most intelligent presidents. The book seemed to quickly skim over his life, for example giving only one chapter to each of his presidential terms. The Lewis and Clark expedition is barely mentioned and I would have liked to know everything that led up to that famous journey. His scientific achievements are also only alluded to during the course of the book. Although it is an easily readable book, I came away wanting to know much more and feeling I did not know the man. Compare this to the excellent John Adams: A Life, and this biography falls well short. If you want a short summation of Jefferson, then this book will suffice."
3,Somewhere between fine and good?,"Okay, so let us concede that nobody can write a singly comprehensive book on Thomas Jefferson. Let's also try and find a common ground between revisionists and conservatives. This isn't the place to find either.However, this book offers a reasonable account of the more significant events in the life of the Sage of Monticello."
3,I will read Julia London books again but I am disappointed.,"I picked up this book because of the author and finished it with hope that author would make a awful story better. In this novel immature Lady Greer goes to Welsh to get her inhertance. She trust the wrong person and believes lies and in the end finds herself a unwanted housequest the Prince of Powys. I really like the prince. The last 1/4 of the book was very good but save your money and pick it up at the library.If you enjoy this genre I would suggest 'What an Earl Wants' by Shirley Karr, 'Secrets of a Duchess' by Kaitlin O'Riley and 'A Lady At Last' by Brenda Joyce."
1,Major Disappointment! =(,"- I stopped at page 100. And ""ditto"" on Greer's attributes already mentioned here.- I've really enjoyed Julia London in the past, (""The Hazards of Hunting a Duke"" was wonderful!) but ""Greer"" was *so* ridiculous: winey, prejudiced, hypocritical, and downright stupid! Her actions, her attitude, even her dialogue! I honestly couldn't find one thing I liked about her.Greer takes Percy, a complete stranger she has met on a public coach, at his every word, for absolutely everything he says, simply because he is smooth and polite and knows how to lay on the charm; where Rhoderick is quiet, honest, albeit, somewhat suspicious and brusque. (And who wouldn't be if some stranger showed up on your doorstep and demanded money? )- I thought perhaps it was just a mood so I put the book down and tried again a couple other times to read it. Nope! No better! I can only recall one other time I have ever put a book down and not completed reading it. This was very disappointing for me! =("
3,Loved the hero...,"As I read this book I felt it was some kind of homage by the author to Bronte and Austen, combining the brooding atmosphere of ""Jane Eyre"" with the witty repartee of ""Pride & Prejudice"" (or, considering the ditsy heroine, more like ""Bridget Jones's Diary""). Like many other reviewers I was put off by the heroine, which lowered the book's overall rating, but I so liked the hero (and am a sucker for castles and ""dark and stormy nights"") that I enjoyed it nonetheless."
2,Not my type of man,"The book wasn't badly written but I just couldn't get into it. Other reviewers have covered the plot so I won't.My problem was the hero. I'm sorry but I want to WANT the hero and I didn't in this book. The first time we meet him the heroine herself says he is ""not handsome or agreeable in anyway"". When the author is describing what he looks like I thought she was describing some villian we would come to know, not the man the heroine (and myself) are supposed to fall in love with. He is described as old with graying hair, a huge scar on his face and a limp. This doesn't make for a very sexy man. I'm sorry but my husband has his own flaws, I don't need to read about somebody else's husband's flaws too!!"
3,This book was just OK...,"I finished it which says something positive. Yes, the heroine did not seem real bright with her decision-making abilities (not following social conventions which seemed so important to her) and the plot was not that unique but it was OK. The hero and his insecurity about some scar or malady seems a little over done in the romance novels."
4,"Good video, but nothing much new.","This is a well done video. There are a lot of talking heads. It didn't tell me much that I didn't already know, but it laid some things out well.The Bush administration (especially Donald Rumsfield) comes off as irresponsible and out-of-touch, but then we already knew this."
5,"Corruption & Incompetence: The U. S. ""planning"" or Iraqi occupation","If you haven't been paying attention to the news and analysis over the last 4 years (or know someone who thinks W & Company have Iraq under control), this is the documentary for you. I have passed it around to my fellow anti-Iraq war friends (who are aware of the issues presented in the documentary) and some of my friends who are inclined to cut W some slack. Both groups feel it is an important film. My copy is now being donated to my local public library."
3,No End in Sight,"Yet another glimpse at the disastrous intervention in Iraq, this time by highly placed former administration officials. One wonders why these folk did not make their voices heard more forcefully when they were insiders. After all, their own oath of office included a pledge ""to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States""."
5,A paradigm-changing revelation!,"""No End in Sight"" very convincingly shows why we never had any business starting a war in Iraq and how our government deliberately created unnecessary violence, destruction and even the whole ""insurgency""! The film shows quite clearly that the agenda was never what our leaders told us (defending against WOMs, removing an evil dictator, bringing 'democracy'), but rather a sinister and cynical plot to gain power and wealth for the elite that the adminsitration serves.Here is a film that gives nightmares - not because of graphic violence, but by demonstrating, in an undeniable way, that 4,000 of our children and a MILLION Iraqis have perished for the depraved gain of the few."
2,Anyone can find a group of opposing views,"Specifically as a movie, it was OK at best. My problem with any movie as this, it's easy to be the Monday morning quarter back and state what could've, should've and would've. If I had the time and money I bet I could find the same amount of people with a 100% opposing view to this movie. No doubt, war is ugly. It appeared way too biased for me. The agenda appeared to be more of a smear campaign."
5,Upsetting reality,"Upsetting viewing, actually took me intervals to watch this as it's extremely depressing. I can't watch it again and will be passing it on to a friend. Not to say it's terrible, it's just hard to stomach the reality of it at times."
4,I love them!!,"Aww, thse boxes are soo cute. Great price for 3 too!!!They really do hold more then it looks. I was able to store everything that couldn't fit anywhere else in my closet and the color is so nuetral that it goes with anything. I highly recommend for storage for kids as well as adults. One less star and that's only because you'll have to tape the ends just to ensure it it stay put!! But then again, that shouldn't be a whole star missing.. maybe just half."
4,Judy,"Easy read, entertaining, a little bit of a mystery. With the title, I expected it to have something to do with dragons but still not bad."
5,Wow,"All I can say is wow it was very good but different from my other book,the book of dragons, but it's from a different author though. I got it because I thought it was from the same author. STILL GOODA!! Get it gooda cheese? *cheese."
3,"A very solid, often not heard album.","I bought this album also after seeing the New Deal video, although much later than it's '91 release, probably more around '96. The songs are catchy and the singers voice is unique, lyrics are good and there's only maybe one track that I used to skip. I give this three stars because although it's good it's not mind blowing or anything, just solid punk rock, my real reason for adding a review to this is to let people know that the sound samples are NOT this album ...I don't know what crap it is but it's not 411's 'This Isn't Me'. Amazon should fix this because here we are talking about how cool this album is and it's represented by bogus sounds."
4,You are wrong guy...lol !!!,"That songs were well heard it by us, skaters, they were part of the soundtrack of an old skate video called ""1281"" from the brand New Deal...in the late 80's or early 90's, i dont remember exactly...One of the best punk bands that i ever heard.."
1,POS,This system is a complete POS! I have had less than a year and have had nothing but problems...and HP customer service..the worst. If you have a couple of spare hours to take care of problem and dont mind being transfered from India to Houston to Costa Rica to PaloAlto all on the same call and still got nothing accomplished. Customer Service fails to listen to their customers and forget about anyone returning your call. There are some serious hardware design problems with this unit or they got [...] parts from their suppliers.
5,Travelling While Standing Still,"The title is deceptively simple, and so is the cover illustration. These aren't leisurely, isn't-the-world-great devotionals, the kind that make no more impression than a passing traveler might. These are devotionals straight from the heart of a sufferer, not someone who looks back from a safe distance on a time of anguish, but one who wakes each day to face his trials anew. They reflect sadness that yet sparkles with joy, realism into which has dawned optimism, pain in a wash of sunlight. Here the reader can glimpse a soul struggling against the odds--and winning with God. This book would have special meaning to anyone, like the author and unlike the man on the cover, who can explore the world only from his own small room."
4,I heard your voice,"This CD was released as a companion to Rhino Records Gene PitneyAnthology CD. All the songs here are different than the ones on the Rhino CD. Most of Gene's big hits were included on Rhino's CD, so you get a lot of lesser known songs here. In fact, there are only three legitimate American hits here, which are ""I Must Be Seeing Things"", ""Princess in Rags"" and ""Backstage"". The rest of the album features flop singles and album cuts. However, I must say that the person who chose these songs did an excellent job. These may not be hit songs, but they are good songs. If you already have the Gene Pitney Anthology, and you want more of the ""Rockville Rocket"", the CD would be a good one to get."
3,easy reading,"This book was an ok book, it took three evenings to finish. I thought the book was more about joy rather then JOY. By that I mean it was more about earthly things & relationships, ect. in life producing joy ~ I had hoped it would have been more about the JOY of the Lord. It is a good book for a brand new Christian or someone searching."
5,Wonderfully relaxing,"Loretta has produced a truly excellent aid to relaxation through conscious breathing and visual imagery. The recording goes a long way to creating the connection between Body, Mind and Spirit. I can truly say that this tape has taken me to levels of relaxation and well-being never before experienced. I do enjoy the soundtrack, too, that accompanies her well modulated voice and superimposed heartbeat. The technique is subtle and effective. I keep this tape in my portable tape recorder and use it at any time that I feel stressed or over-tired. I strongly recommend this recording to anyone who needs that stress relief that is so healing. The affirmations given at the end of the tape are well expressed and inspiring.Carolyn Sue Docker, RN"
2,Good for Light Use,"I am a heavy duty mechanic by trade and I bought this for use in some of the smaller jobs at work. Well, it broke in less than a month. The drive tip snaped off while I was tightening down some fuel pump bolts. I really do like the design and it is easy to change from forward to reverse with one hand, but I thought the quality would have been better. I think the wobble head design seriously weakens the drive tip. I guess I should have bought the standard tip model but who knows. It would be great around the garage at home but I wouldn't call it a professional grade tool."
3,wrong picture!! this # is not the longe neck version,"just wanted to let everyone know this is the regular mini air ratchet and not the extended head like the picture shows. Search florida pneumatic and you'll see the right pictured. That being said the build quality is terrific, on par with snap's far's, much better than those blue point, or mac's. I got tired of my snap on far25 cracking on me and my mac is on backorder. I just got this today and we'll see how it works this week. Will update later this week. Only thing that concern me is the reverse/forward mechanism, not sure how long that'll hold up during everyday use."
5,Great career retrospective of a legendary talent.,"Our friends in Canada bring us this 15 track set that encompasses highlights of Herb Alpert's illustrious career 1962-1991. Many of the usual Alpert compilation cuts are here but there are a few surprises toward the end of the disc as several ""not-yet-available-on-CD-in-America"" versions of songs are featured. There are long forgotten single edits of ""Rise"", ""Rotation"" and ""Keep Your Eye On Me"" and rare remixed versions of ""Diamonds"" and ""Jump Street"", the latter featuring a vocal by Yvonne De La Vega. The sound quality is great and the fold out photo collage is nice. All in all, a first class collection of hits from a classy artist."
5,the best,It had songs on it that I haven't heard in years and love to hear them again. I grew up with the songs and I knew what I was doing when I heard them then
5,A breath of fresh air!,"It pains me to see bands like this not getting the recognition they deserve. This album is just plain awesome. It has an epic scope to it that makes it seem like a soundtrack. It's refreshing to see bands coming about that take classical elements and use them with metal. This is a stand-out album in a sea of Gothic mediocrity. It reminds me of Nightwish in a way, but there are more choir and orchestra here. The album takes you on a wonderful ride. If you're new to Gothic or metal music, you might find some of the male guttural singing a bit annoying, but I like to think it complements the soft female voice---plus it's just one of the many aspects of metal singing. Don't miss this album. It's a winner!"
3,Consign to Oblivion is much better,"I was disappointed with this album.The recording wasn't as good as Consign to Oblivion ,and neither was Simone's singing."
3,Could Be Much Better,"I liked the choral harmonies on tracks like the opening ""Adyta"" and thought the lyrics, when I could understand them, were thought-provoking (though sure to annoy religious conservatives). I even tolerated Mark Jansen's growling. However, I would have liked a stronger, more confident vocal performance from soloist Simone Simons. Often, she seemed hesitant and unsure. She mumbled rather than sang her words--which made it difficult to understand the lyrics without looking at the liner notes. At other times, when she sang near the top of her range, she sounded tense and shrill, as if she needed more breath support and space to stay on pitch (e.g., ""Facade of Reality""). Finally, I would have liked more song variety. After a few listens, all of the songs sounded the same to me. In my opinion, this cd is good for the occasional listen but not something I could listen to everyday."
4,Delightful and Easy to Read,"Delightful, well written autobiography by Merv Griffin. This fun-to-read book explores Griffin's early family life and beginnings as a big band singer, migrating to talk show host, television game show creator, to hotel magnate, entrepreneur and millionaire many times over. The book is easy to read and goes quickly. I only wish the captions for the photos had been with the photos instead of in an index in the back."
3,Save your money,"There are bits of interesting stories sprinkled throughout the book. However, you can find many of the key points in the book on Wikipedia."
2,I don't agree,"I can't believe the other reviewers liked this book. I thought it was drivel. Ok, it was mildly entertaining if you could overlook the inconsistancies in time, geography, and stupid stereotypes about the people in the book. (not to mention the glaring lack of depth of characters and plot) But my main complaint about the book is, (I live in Oklahoma) that at the very least, the author could have picked up an Oklahoma map to make sure the characters were on the right highway to their destinations. If this is a ""true story"" use real towns and highways, if it is fiction, don't try to pass it off as true.It is very unbelievable."
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","The History of the Periodic Table ==Atomic Structure & the Periodic Table (2004) ==The Periodic Table : PROPERTIES OF COMPOUNDS ==Properties of compounds ==Properties of Elements (The Periodic Table for Students) == ---> all are One and the same, but the prices are Different"
1,"Snappy Dresser, Horrible DJ !!","Those quirky slave trenders known as ""THEY"" have termed Mr. Sanchez the ""Fashionable DJ"". Based on the cover of this cd, one has to give Sanchez points for his fashion sense....however, after several plays of this cd, I still don't get it! For starters, the tune selection here is very obtuse and only suitable for background music at an artshow for stuff nobody hangs on their walls !! Sanchez has all the mixing skills of a kindergarten teacher playing musical chairs with her class....the abrupt stops and starts don't add to this cd! Hey Frederic....its called ""CONTINUOUS MIX""...try it !! This cd goes in 20 different directions and never develops into anything but a headache !! I tried to find one saving grace on this album but alas, I'm at a loss. I loved ""Human Fly"" when the Cramps did it back in the 80's but the new version doesn't add anything !! This cd is one expensive frisbee.....avoid it unless you are close personal friend of Mr. Sanchez !!"
3,self esteem CD,I was curious about how this works... and I tried it for a while but I am not quite sure if it really works. I still enjoy the quiet music and the relaxing sounds.
3,problems with multiple devices,"I hooked up a hard drive, iPhone, iPod, scanner, and mouse. All products worked, and even though the mouse and scanner are USB 1.1 and the other devices are USB 2, the USB 2 devices worked at high speed. However, occasionally the connection to one or more devices you drop for a second, or for just enough time for my computer to think the device had been unplugged and plugged back it. This is usually annoying, but problematic when it happends when using the device (e.g., when syncing the iPhone or when writing to or reading from the hard drive). This problem happened even when I unplugged the scanner and mouse and only left the USB 2 devices plugged in, and the hub was powered from the AC adapter when it the problems happened.Too bad, beccause the hub is compact and otherwise convenient."
1,OK Tiil It Burns Up,"Bought this from Amazon on September 1, 2007. Worked great for about 3-1/2 months. It burned up (well,not quite, just got extremely hot) and quit working on 12/14/2007."
1,Broke within the Week,"The hub worked fine for a few days, I was very happy with it. BUt one day when I turned on my computer windows kept telling me that I had an unrecognized USB device, and that none of my items plugged in through the USB hub were being recognized. I reached down and noticed the unit was very hot, too hot to touch, and was a fire hazard. I'm returning it and buying a name-brand hub, costs a little more but obviously worth it. Avoid this product."
2,Dropped Connections,First experience with more than a 4-port hub. This one kept dropping my connection. Had to return it.
1,"Worked for a few month, then stopped working","Loved it, then it broke, now I wish I'd not purchased it. There's not much to love/hate about a USB router other than its reliability, which puts this into the ""avoid"" category as far as I'm concerned. Go elsewhere for your hub needs, like the d-link 7-port hub or the Cyberpower one."
4,great so far,"No problems with this unit at all thus far (I've had it about a month). It's small and unobtrusive, and I like that it has most of its ports on the front. No problems with power or connection that I can tell. The only thing I wish it had were indicator lights to let me know that things were connected correctly, but it's not much of an inconvenience given the price and reliability compared to other equivalent items I've seen reviewed here. Also, it looks black and white in the photo, but it's actually black and silver, which was a pleasant surprise for me."
5,Very pleased,"I use nearly all of the ports of this hub, with no problems. I had had problems with another powered hub before, in sync'ing my Treo - but not with this one."
1,Didn't work,"The product doesn't work. I plugged it in and after a couple of hours, my devices stopped working. I thought it was a problem with the peripherals, but alas, it was not, as I plugged them back directly into my computer and they worked fine. Disappointing..."
2,Wrong AC Adapter shipped!,"Included in the package is the wrong AC adapter that can't even plugin. It puzzled me how this can happen. The only explaining maybe they sent me a customer returned product and the previous owner packed the wrong AC adapter with it. Very disappointing. While it works well without AC adapter on some device, any USB device that draws more power (like portable HD) will require it to be plugged in to power."
3,"Alright for the money, but...","like many other reviewers have stated, it causes dropouts on some devices. My mouse cut out a few times, my midi keyboard would power but would not send messages, and my iphone always has problems syncing to itunes. I don't feel too cheated at $10, but I would probably invest a little more in something that works."
2,Poor purchase,"I would highly recommend avoiding this item. I read these reviews, and I considered myself technically savvy enough to figure out any problems I encountered with this product. Right out of the box, half of the ports consistently didn't work. I tried using the ones that did, and every few minutes the hub would disconnect and reconnect, causing my two external drives to reconnect as well- if I had been writing data to them, it could have been very bad... So I played around with safe devices for a while and didn't have any successful attempts to get the hub working.Long story short: don't be dumb like me and ignore the bad reviews- if you get stuck with a lemon, it's essentially worthless. Unless you like returning things.(Two stars because if it had worked, the small size and amount of ports is a big plus.)"
5,Just what I needed,"I needed something to help control all of my USB port products like external hard drive, DVD Burner, Camera, Printer, Mouse, and Flash drives without having to plug and unplug from the back of the computer everytime. It works great and is very small and compact. No complaints here"
1,Ugh.,"The problem with this hub is that it has horrible latency. If you're planning on plugging a thumb drive or external hard drive into this, forget it. If you're trying to run a keyboard & mouse, it'll probably work fine. Go from the point of view that anything with an extremely low data rate will work just fine, but anything else is going to have major issues."
2,Disappointed,"I am using this on my iMac and it works... sometimes. I bought it to charge/sync my iphones with the idea of charging them when the computer was logged off. Not only doesn't it work that way but sometimes it has to be reset to even ""see"" what is plugged into it. Sometimes during a sync it will disconnect or sync very slowly. If you are going to use this hub like I am, move on to something else."
2,Plastic motor housing.,"Yeah, for the money, I'm not sure I would have paid for something with a chrome plastic motor housing. Cheap construction quality. I just don't understand why they would cheap out with the motor?... Perhaps another item made in China."
2,The motor is slow,"I had an older Atlas 150 and loved it. It's done well for me over the years. I wanted the motor, but I had to get a whole new set because the motor would not fit on the old hand crack one.When I got it, I found the machine minus the motor hadn't changed much over the years. The motor sounds sturdy and the thing went together pretty easily. My grip is the motor is SLOW. It takes forever to roll out a batch made with a half dozen eggs. Using the motor won't speed the job up, it will slow it down. So only two stars, as the product's feature is the motor."
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","Atomic Structure & the Periodic Table (2004) = The Periodic Table : PROPERTIES OF COMPOUNDS = Properties of compounds = Properties of Elements (The Periodic Table for Students)---> all are One and the same, but the prices are Different"
4,Happy to find these filters!,I was very pleased to find these replacement filters. I use my Dirt Devil a lot and new filters were needed.
4,Student Review,"I loved the book Skinnybones. You can really have a good laugh if you read this book. It is a very good book because it is really funny. I think that this is an awesome book for children. The main charter is Alex. Alex is in 5th grade . Alex is so funny he is also a very nice kid. I think Alex is very funny because he names his baloney sandwiches. Once when Alex had to introduce himself to the class he said to the class ""Once I had a baloney sandwich and I named him Oscar!"" It was very funny. I think that if you want to read a hysterical you should read Skinnybones! I think that Skinnybones is a great book!By: Rachael L."
1,Skinny Bones,Skinny BonesAlex is not good at Baseball. As a matter of fact he stinks. Everyone calls him SkinnyBones because he is small and skinny. He has played for many of years. Then one day he brags and gets into trouble with T.J. Stoner. They do a pitching contest and loses. He gets made fun of an T.J Stoner is the best Baseball payer in the town.Everything goes wrong until he wins a Kitty Fritters contest. He wins it on the food his cat eats. This helps kids to like him.I think this book is good because it is funny. I think this is a Middle School book. I think people that like Baseball or sports would like this book. This book is funny because when he throws the ball it rolls over the plate.
4,A Kid's Book Review,"This is a really good book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Also, if you like comedy books this would be a fine book to read. One part that made me laugh is when Alex lies about the kitty fritters. Alex is the main character in the book. He is known for lying. So if you like books with people lying in it, this is a good book for you."
5,Skinnybones,"The book, Skinnybones, was about these two kids and a baseball game. The two boys are Alex and TJ. Alex and TJ had a baseball game which ended with Alex yelling, ""BOOGA, BOOGA!"" I think the book was really funny because the other kids in the school were picking on Alex. They picked on Alex for saying, ""BOOGA, BOOGA!"" I wish the author changed TJ from cocky to nice because he was mean to Alex and other kids. I would recommend this book to any fifth grader who loves baseball."
5,can get anyone to read,I have a twelve year old that hates to read. I bought this book for him in yet another desperate attempt to interest him in reading. He read it in a couple of hours! He couldnt put it down and laughed the whole time he read. He now loves Barbara Park and has asked for more of her books.
3,The book was ok but could have been better,"This story is about a little boy who likes baseball and won a contest to be on a TV commercial. He is the smallest boy on his baseball team. I like this story because it is funny. But, I thought this story had too much fantasy in it. It would be better if it spent more time dealing with baseball games instead of Alex getting beat up."
5,They call this doll my FIRST baby doll for a reason...,"This doll is fantastic for VERY YOUNG children. I bought this for my twins who are just turning one. They are in love with their older sister's baby dolls, which they really shouldn't be playing with due to choking hazards. This doll is appropriately sized for a very small child, with embroidered eyes, mouth, etc. It is a stuffed doll, so no problem if your child sucks on it. Very soft, so nice for giving hugs. The small bottle and teddy bear are large enough that they do not pose choking hazards. Yes, the doll is hard for a child to dress, but the kids I think it is most appropriate for are not yet old enough to rip clothes off and dress it. The bed is also soft fabric, another bonus for the very young kid. I didn't know what to expect when I placed my order and was VERY pleased with the result. Perfect 1st birthday gift. Don't even THINK of giving this to an older (say 2 year old) child."
2,No Video Out on New iPods,I had a 5th Gen iPod and everything worked great. Now I have a iPod Classic. Video out no longer works.Careful. This product is obsolete. :(
1,ADD 4 STARS! NO MORE HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"First I have to say, I have ordered numerous products from Amazon.com and they are fantastic! I always get my items quickly with absolutly no problems. I have always been satisfied with the things I've ordered, but this entertainment dock is a real disappointment. It charged fine, and I didn't even try the remote (I wouldn't care to have another remote to worry about anyway). As far as the sound quality; it was terrible. There's so much static I can't hear the words. Most other reviews say it sounds great though. Could I be doing something wrong? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I love to listen to my Ipod but wearing earphones just isn't convienient. I really would like to give this thing a chance as I don't want to give up just yet. Well, I had it plugged in the wrong input. It was in phono and I switched it to the CD input and now it sounds great! :)"
3,"Not bad, but not good",Thought it would put the ipod on the tv. not just the videos. Every time I want to change to a new video I have to get up and walk over to the dock and look at the IPOD.
3,"Good, but the remote doesn't work","I was able to hook this up with relative ease (more wires in the back of my tv) and the iPod works through the speakers from the stereo. However, the remote doesn't work and there is absolutely NO contact information throught the Kensington site about where to find help. I like the sleek look of it and the remote mimics the iPod."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Sound and video quality are great. Easy to use remote and this is a good quality product. One downfall - don't expect this to display your iPod screen. It only displays video and pictures - not the music menus. This is NOT a problem with the Kensington, but a lack of feature of the iPod. I was hoping to be able to see the music menus from across the room on my TV - but you have to be right in front of the iPod to scroll through any of the menus."
2,"Good Dock, Lousy RF Remote","The dock portion of this works great. The radio frequency remote is only a tad better than an IR remote. I have to be within three feet of a line of site of the dock for the remote to work. Outside of this range, it simply doesn't perform. I could have saved money and purchased a line of sight with IR remote and bought IR repeaters.Amazon shipped this unit late. It took over 12 business days to get the unit from the time I order it. Free shipping is no bargain. I could have recieved the unit from NewEgg in three days for only a $1 more than I paid at Amazon."
1,"Entertainment Dock great, remote control not so great","Physically, the remote control is not of the same quality as the dock. It has three buttons at the top and a simulated iPod selection wheel below them that is actually 5 discreet membrane type buttons under a disc. The range is about 20ft and even close to the dock the buttons ""miss"". I'm not sure if the problems are purely related to the transmitter/receiver pair or poor quality buttons or both. It is unfortunate as the base and cabling that came with it are of the same solid durable feel as an iPod. The remote alone is what dragged my rating down to a 1."
1,Piece of junk,"The unit has worked OK although the remote failed intermittently from day one. Now the Increase Volume(+) and skip foward on the remote doesn't work at all. This leaves the docking station a useless piece of junk because although the volume on the Ipod is on MAX, the volume on the docking station can't be increased(without the remote) so that it leaves the music is at an inaudible level."
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A NEWER IPOD!,"I just got an Ipod Touch, and video out DOES NOT work with this dock. I don't understand why it doesn't work but it's a major bummer!"
4,Lacks complete directions,"The sound quality from this product is exceptional, given the price (paid 19.99 used). My big beef is that no where in the directions does it refer to setting the volume for the adapter (exclusive of the Ipod) to maximum. The dock will not work properly until you set it's volume to max."
5,Very groovin first effort~~A must-have,"Math and Other Problems sealed my love for the Marvies. How could you not want to listen to songs like Katrina and Make-up over and over. For their first cd, it has a very good sound and the lyrics are provocative. Five stars aren't enough!"
1,rough fabric,"fit was fine, but fabric was very rough. It was like wearing a burlap sack, just tougher."
5,Great Album,"I love Natalie's new album!!!! It shows a more mature side to her. She grows more with this second album. Her lyrics and her voice show that she has grown a lot since her first album came out. I think Natalie will be here for a long time to come. If you don't own this album yet, you need to get yourself a copy!!!!!"
5,"Well-Written, Helpful","Kim Jonn helped me to understand God's way of rescuing us. It is comforting to know that God wants to carry our burdens and that, in our weakness, we can find strength in Him."
2,Stick with MKSAP,"The answers to the questions are the strength of this book. The questions themselves are much less clinical than the scenarios seen in MKSAP or Case Files. Overall, the book is closer to Step 1 prep than Shelf or Step 2. With the IM Shelf being one of the most difficult to finish in the alloted time, practice with clinical vignettes--as opposed to matching and 2 line scenarios--is more realistic and high yield. Buy MKSAP and Case Files instead."
3,Not challenging enough,"Although I generally tend to like the PreTest series, the questions in this book are not challenging enough to prepare you for either the internal medicine shelf exam or the USMLE Step 2 exam. It does fit in a lab coat pocket, though. Although it's not enough to ace the internal medicine shelf, I would recommend the Case Files series Internal Medicine text."
3,"Awesome album, bad remastering","Top rate songs, but Toni Ubler and MTM ruined another gem with heavy dynamic range compression. Annica has a voice sorta like Bonnie Tyler, but it isn't all rasp. Very passionate, melodic singer. This is definitely a bit heavier and more aggressive then a lot of Annica's contemporaries from the 80s. More then Stage Dolls, Million(No 1), Karo, Erika, Treat, or Da Vinci. It's closer to Fate's heaviest albums and the lighter songs are comparable to Laos-We Want It.I'm glad that MTM remasters introduced me to these great albums, so I've ended up hunting down original pressings of a lot(at considerable prices too). The original cd editions are far superior. This one is very elusive. Annica Wiklund herself doesn't have copies, but said she'd let me know if an original cd turns up. If anyone else has one, feel free to add me as an amazon friend and leave me a message."
1,late and short,I found Barry farms through amazon and ordered 46 oz of sorghum from their website on 6/25. After my third email requesting a tracking no. I received an email from postal service stating that the product was being mailed on 7/2. No responses directly from Barry farms. I received my order and it was 32 oz quart jar and my invoice states 46 oz. I emailed them again.
1,Sorghun not sorghum?,"The product was cloudy and pale, not dark and clear like true sorghum syrup. The taste and mouthfeel was more reminiscent of gum acacia or gelatin. I was very dissapointed and discarded the material as unappetizing at best. I found another supplier who is a member of the sorghum syrup producers association and displays their logo."
1,Not what was expected!!,"I searched for a long time yo find sorghum syrup. After receiving my JUG of Barry Farm sorghum syrup, I still have not found it!! It was totally tasteless and goopy. I spent nearly fifty plus years in the food and food relatedindustry, I've experienced the very best and a good deal of the worst, this product belongs to the latter...enough said!"
1,Not your grandmother's sorghum,"I ordered a quart of ""pure sorghum syrup"" and it was delivered in good condition, packaged well, and arrived quickly to my doorstep. That is where the compliments end. This was not sorghum. It was pale and sweet with a weird aftertaste, and had a taste more like karo corn syrup than anything that is like sorghum molasses. I was very disappointed and had to throw it out since no one would eat it. If you like karo corn syrup on your pancakes this is for you. Sadly not for me."
2,Poor taste,"I was really disappointed with the Sorghum we purchased. We have been users of it for over 50 years, and have previously had bought it from other vendors, usually from Indiana. This product, though sweet, did not have the expected molasses taste. It was just too bland.Walter C. Daniels"
4,"hard to find item here, APO",Can`t find this item here for the military in Germany. Graet to have some of that home taste over here. The product was fine but thé cost I paid for shipping wasn`t the same as what the company paid for USPS. Paid more then what they paid to ship to me. Maybe they should relooc at the shipping fees for APO's. Thanks.
4,NEAR GRINDHOUSE,"The movie starts out like it is going to be a pretty good grindhouse. Tough guy Dave Bautista, as Ray walks through The Rising Sun, a strip joint in Grand Rapids. It has illegal gambling and prostitution upstairs. Ray is an ex-cop who just got out of jail and works for a guy named ""Vinnie."" While watching the door, some gunmen rob the place and shoot Vinnie's son.Vinnie wants Ray to use his police abilities to find the guys who killed his son, and bring them to him. As Ray investigates the murder, his suspects die, making it look like he is involved. In fact so many get shot and killed at one point I was laughing. As the police and Vinnie's boys hunt down Ray, Ray must try to solve the crime to a sound track of metal and hip-hop music. The grindhouse aspect of the movie wanes as it becomes an action/drama. Danny Trejo has a small role. In acting Baustista is above Steve Austin and Seagall, but he is no Vin Diesel.F-bomb, sex, nudity."
3,Bautista is Good,"Baustita is a gruff, no-nonsense ex-cop ex-con working in a club with ""illegal"" gambling and prostituion. Unfortunately the story and acting are not very good. And the ending leaves you hanging. Perhaps more sex and nudity would have improved it. Rent don't buy."
1,Horrid,"The acting is so completely bad, it's actually a tone for the whole movie.New York accents all done by non New Yorkers and done in the worst way, all in uniform.Awful. NO STARS"
1,AWFUL,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I EVER VIEWED. FROM THE CASTING TO THE DIALOGUE TO THE ACTING TO THE PLOT TO THE ENDING. THERE IS NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TATTOOED HULK AND THE PETITE BLOND. THE HULK CANT ACT. HIS LINES AND PHYSICAL MOVES REMINDED ME OF A HIGH-SCHOOL PLAY. THERE WERE TOO MANY BAD CHARACTERS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP THEM SEPERATED AND MOST OF THEM WERE ELEMINATED BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPOTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR ROLE.
1,spurious logic,"This is a book rich in logical flaws, wrongheaded conclusions, and outright mistakes. ..."
4,classic and classy,"My mother owns this perfume.She loves it so much that she bought three bottles of this!And she had used all of them up.She was saying that this perfume can wake the dead and i totally agree with her.Though it smells somehow classic,i really liked it,cause it had such a rich and overwealming scent.I'll say it's far better than all the Channel perfumes which are really overhyped and overpriced.I wouldn't recommend this perfume to a young girl like myself,cause it's a bit heavy to wear everyday at school,but i would definately recommend it to a working woman who wants to smell feminine and sophisticated all day long without having to reapply her perfume again and again.It's the most appropriate fragrance to wear on a fancy party or Galla or a job interview or meeting.I guarantee that no one will ever forget the way your skin smells with Escada."
2,Dog chewed right this,"Sorry. We have a Cattle Dog and she destroyed this in record time. If you have a ""El Destructo"" dog, you're better off with Nylabones."
1,Just an Infomercial for Itself,"Had hopes for this one, but really only the gullible or blindly pious need view it. The phenomenon may have some herpetological interest, but since the species of snake is never even identified by the supposedly objective ""investigators,"" nor given any possible behavioral explanation other than that ""It's A Miracle!"" you tend to feel set up. A very static film with talking heads just talking for minutes without relief of any action but their breathing, it's only 47 minutes long and almost 30 of those aren't even devoted to the subject matter. Instead there's sundry observations on the history of Greece, the tourism of the island, and some very general remarks on the Greek Orthodox Church, all of which could be found in any child's encyclopedia. The filmmakers may as well have introduced UFOs as possible answers to the ""miracle,"" to up their sales (and maybe viewer interest). So, caveat emptor: even believers (including me) should stay away."
1,Shipping twice the cost of the item,"Shipping is over twice the cost of the item. Hmmmmm, wonder if they're selling any?"
4,Roy,"Roy Clark is a very talented individual. He has a great sense of humor that carries into some of his songs, but he also has a serious side. I wish I could find a CD of a live performance he once did..."
1,Yet another shameless self promotion from Playboy,"The only really worthwhile information I got from this book was about the coat hangers. The rest of the book is littered with the same self important tripe Playboy is famous for. Anything for another buck. If you want to know how pygmy s use goat eyelashes for sex, or the dozen plus different definitions of Venus butterfly then buy this book. If you actual want to improve your love life try sitting down and TALKING to your partner.Playboy does not more know about your own sex life than you do."
3,Slightly misaligned,"Quality product with proper perimeter dimensions for my 2005 Hyundai Elantra, however, 2 pre-drilled nut holes are misaligned. With a couple small cuts, close to the pre-drilled holes, I was able to make this gasket work. But it should be a perfect fit, holes and all...it is not."
4,Dear God,Dear God [Region 2]The movie was very good and uplifting. Alot of familar actors & actresses in it.
4,none,i thought that this was very goo d movie i likes it how the pose office people disated to help the caracter tom make people happy by answering gods mail.
3,"Cute, uplifting movie","I remember seeing this in the theatre and I really think this is a fun movie to watch. Greg Kinnear is fun, the rest of the characters are great to watch, and even though the story is a little weak at times, it still makes you laugh. It also shows that when people band together, there's a lot they can accomplish."
5,Heartwarming,Greg seems to always do good dramas or is out for everyone's heart. This film does the most with it's ability to really influence your compassionate side.
4,Darling Little Movie,"This was a fun and darling little movie. Cute story line, not academy quality, but enjoyable family movie. It was worth watching. I would watch it again."
4,"Pop, lovely pop from a very hard working softie.","I've been hearing some of these songs in my head off and on since they came out, but now that I'm separated from my vinyl copies of Mr Rhodes recording, I'm anxious to hear'm again. Powerful in a breezy incidental way. Once you've heard ""Fresh as a Daisy"" you'll be singing it to your dreadful lunch-time burger and wondering why you didn't spend more energy on your music lessons. I believe the story years ago with Mr. Rhodes was that he was sick of the critizism of his work and if y'don't like it plug your ears. I've got an LP with a little note from the artist saying good-bye to his fans and f*ck-you to his detractors."
5,This is great!!,"This is absolutely the best stuff. We marinate with it, use it in stir fry, and add it to soups and stews."
1,i got a huge bottle from costco,"this stuff tastes NASTY. the ingredients look similar to some Filipino adobo marinades(mostly soy sauce), but the flavor is mostly salty(its mostly made for soy sauce)sour/bitter earthy. avoid this product, protect your toungeother thought- what kind of sauce is made out of another sauce?"
5,Chaka's Mmm Sauce Marinade,This is hands down the best marinade we've ever tasted or used in 30-odd years of grilling. It's great on everything.
5,Sealed my exhaust well,"Made of thick and good material, this went into a new exhaust system installation and sealed it very well. I recommend you replace this gasket everytime you take your midpipe off."
1,"Horrible, and honestly a bit propagandist.","This game is really just not fun. Unless you really embrace the roles you are given in the instructions, money grubbing jerk for monopolists valiant defender of the free market for the competitors, I don't really see how you can enjoy yourself. My wife and I were both very excited to give it a try, but that hope decreased rapidly as we read through the instructions and ran out before we made it around the board even one time."
2,Boring!,"My son was excited to get this game for Christmas, but after playing it one time was disappointed. Not worth the cost of the game."
2,Love the history; this printing did not include some pages.,"I was thoroughly enjoying skimming through the book for old ideas in household gadgets, clothing and such, when I looked specifically for ""kit houses."" It was not mentioned, but ""house"" was - on a page that was not printed in this edition. I began from the beginning of the book and found countless pages not printed. Page 21 was on the back of 24, 27 was on the back of 34, and so on. That was very disappointing, which is why I slashed the rating. Did these pages get included in newer reproductions? I'd like to see what was missing. And I would love to see a description of kit houses and how much they went for in those days."
3,Best Ever at Linebacker,"Never been a Bears fan, never will. But who amongst us growing up in the '60s and loving football, did not admire Dick Butkus? Whatta' player! I loved the cover of this book! What a menacing figure! Let's talk about the book. Overall, a good, insightful book but a couple of items disappointed me. First, the ramblings about his falling out with the Bears. After many pages, I felt like saying, 'Get over it!' but considering who I would be speaking to...well. Second, I was curious what his kids grew up to be like. Not much mention of his wife nowadays either. But, this is a book about Butkus and his life was football. Fun to read..."
5,"Get 'em, #51!","Dick Butkus was a fantastic football player and his book was a joy to read. I especially enjoyed his childhood memories and his dreams when he was young. It is a shame that his knee broke down, robbing him of years on the football field, but what was even worse was the way Halas betrayed him. Fortunately, the city of Chicago and the rest of the football world never stopped admiring the greatest tackler that ever lived. And the most amazing thing of all is that he played for so many years in so much pain - pain most of us couldn't even cope with walking down the street. While Payton was the epitome of greatness on the offensive side of the ball, Butkus was it on the defensive side. What an amazing player."
1,"Shotguns, not American Hunting Rifles",Mostly about shotguns. Not American hunting riles. I guess this English publisher thinks shotguns are rifles.
3,Hunting rifles?????,"I thought this was about hunting rifles, it's about shotguns! I happen to like shotguns as well so it's not a total loss but buyers beware, I didn't find a single rifle in the whole book????"
5,Essential Maps for Swedish Research,"This book is the essential atlas for Swedish genealogical research. It is a shame it is out of print. It has maps of each Swedish county and the parishes within each, as well as indices so you can locate the parish if you only know its name. It is a priceless gem and since it was published as a spiral bound, photocopied page book with only a cardstock cover, my copy is falling apart from use."
1,"Dated, and cheap 50's pop muzak...","This is middle of the road pop music from the 50's at it's worst. Compare anything Teresa Brewer did to any talented singers like Ella Fitzgerald, Anita O'Day, or even Rosemary Clooney, or Doris Day. Teresa Brewer belongs in the category of talentlass hacks like Patti Page and Andy Williams. Stay away from this dated muzak."
4,I received a bag of 19 not 20,"Other than being short 1 pin (which I didn't need) these worked for my Hon 72"" bookcase which had been in storage and was of course missing the pins when it came time to use."
3,Just a question for anyone who has these pins:,"Are these ones that would be used in an IVAR system? That's what I need, but I can't seem to verify that this is what they could be used for. Thanks!"
1,Definitely skip this one,"The so-called hero is a brute and a bully. At one point he attempts to starve his wife into bending to his rule. They hate each other until the very last page of the book, when they suddenly, and totally unconvincingly, declare their undying love! Give me a break!"
1,Pass this one by,"This is a horrible story. The heroine is brutally raped by the ""hero."" He decides he must marry her to save her reputation. Of course, as the story develops, we find out that the hero is really not such a bad guy. The heroine (who is extremely immature and not too bright) falls in love with him, and they are on their way to living happily ever after. I don't think so. Don't waste your time on this one, it's a major disappointment."
5,True Wisdom in allegory form,"Just like ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Little Pilgrim's Progress; ""Tales of the Kingdom,""""Tales of the Resistance,"" and ""Tales of the Restoration""are some of the finest books you can read to your children, whileenjoying them and learning from them, yourself!"
2,Tales of the Kingdom Hardcover,"I was a bit disappointed when I received this book in the mail and flipped through it. One of the pages was scribbled with a significant amount of green marker, and another couple pages had crayon ""drawings"" on them. This was not listed in the review, and I was sad to find that the review didn't match the quality of the actual product.Besides this flaw, the book is absolutely amazing. I love to read it myself and have enjoyed sharing it with others."
5,Beautiful Story,"This story is about a young boy who finds love and acceptance. My mom read it to me when I was a little girl. It is a wonderful book to read to any age. The boy Hero, and the Princess Amanda struggle through real problems, like me. Yet through the help of wise leaders, they are taught to overcome. The illustrations in the original book are incredible. Please reprint the books with the original illustrator!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful Book!,"This book (and Tales of the Resistance) were both given to me when I was very young. I was given the tapes as well (if you get a chance to listen to them, do! ). These books are absolutely wonderful! I learned so much from them! I've been looking for them for ages, and they NEED TO BE REPRINTED WITH THE ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATOR! Read these books, they are well worth your while!"
5,pin-drop silence,"I have been reading this book to my 3 kids ranging in age from 5-9. The middle one is especially fidgety in nature and cannot sit still for a long period of time. I laugh when I tell my husband that for each and every story that's read, you can hear a pin drop- they are that quiet and still. If I look up from reading, they all have their chins cupped in their hands with wide eyes staring at me. and, of course, when the story is over, the kids cry- please, keep on reading! The kids are also planning their own ""Tales of the Kingdom' party, each picking a character from the book to be for the party. I am amazed at how much one book has sparked their imaginations and creativity."
5,Powerful Worship Album,"This is an excellent recording. My favorite thing about it is the candid and very meaningful lyrics of worship of the Lord. It is not a typical worship album. In my opinion, the lyrics are more meaningful, and the music is well, different. I LOVE it! You will find this album is slower paced than many of The Violet Burning's projects, and you might take some time to warm up to it, but once you do it will most likely be one of your favorites. A must have for anyone."
1,Short-Changed,"9 episodes of D&D for $9? Do yourself a favor and fork over $5 more for the complete 27 episode version... unless your a completist, the picture disc IS different for this release (it contains the title ""The Animated Series, Beginnings"" and has a cool world map, a layout of the land -- Tolkien style). It does not even remotely compare to the $40 BCI edition with all of the extras; and remastered, espcially in comparison that it's missing the other 18 episodes. This introduction DVD version, played on my Blu-ray player couldn't even help color-correct this edition; parts would be 'bright' and then all of a sudden wash-out and get dull; at approximately 3 hours and 18 minutes, it felt awfully compressed. The sound is great; the packaging is ultra strange, a huge clam case that holds... one envelope."
3,Animated Series,"This collects the first 9 episodes of the 80s Dungeons & Dragons cartoon. It is a little slow to get going but after awhile it was o.k. Has Tiamat in the picture. A group of kids go on a magical fair ride where they are transported to a differant realm and become fantasy characters: ranger, acrobat, thief, cavalier, wizard and barbarian. I thought it was o.k."
3,There are better...,"Got this and thought it was just so-so. A lot of non-stop bass beat and fragments of familiar vocals. Not bad, but not as good as the other Euphoria collections. If you've got a collection going, and must have it, it's OK. If not, I'd pass. Not one that I'd recommend."
3,Enjoyable slice of predictable melodic rock,"Josh Ramos has certainly paid his dues as the ax-man for Two Fires, the Storm, and others, and now has finally released his own solo record. The strengths of this release are obvious: Mark Weitz's singing is above-par for this genre and has a slight edge to it; Kelly Hansen's production is first-rate and expansive; and Ramos himself is on fire throughout most of the tracks. This is the most inspired playing I've heard from him. Really, the only negative is that the songs are pretty standard stuff. I really like ""Living in the Light,"" ""Don't Go"" and a few others, but there's nothing new or even terribly exciting on here. This is a solid, not spectacular release."
4,"Now, you'll always see 'em hangin' around.","Let me try to clear things up. There were actually two surf groups that billed themselves as ""The Surfaris"". The more succesful of the two groups was the one that had a hit with ""Wipe Out"". The second group, whose most famous song is ""Bombora"", were legally forced to change their name to ""The Original Surfaris"" after the other group became nationally famous because of ""Wipe Out"". This CD doesn't feature ""The Original Surfaris; it features ""The Surfaris"" of ""Wipe Out"" fame. The CD is the Varese Sarabande Records follow up toWipe Out! The Best of the Surfaris. Sort of a ""Best of the Surfaris, Volume 2"". Perhaps surprisingly, there was actually enough good material left off of the first CD to make a good second CD. There are 16 good surf instrumentals here, plus three pretty cool songs about motorbikes with vocals. Seven of the instrumentals were previously unreleased, but it was not due to lack of quality. Surf music fans should enjoy this CD a lot."
4,Soft tires wear fast,Tires handle well. Good in moderate mud. good for general trail riding. Only down side is that these tires wear quickly.
2,Order the book and get the same program for FREE,"It's amazing to think that anyone would buy this program when it can be downloaded from the Microsoft site for free. If you need a CD, then order Microsoft's book, ""Build a Program Now!, Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition"" by Patrice Pelland for about a third of the price. The CD comes with the complete program.The two stars are for sticking it to the consumer and does not reflect on VB Express itself. The program is quite good and an excellent way to get started with programming--especially with the ""Build a Program Now!"" book."
1,This is pure dross,The entire X-Men history of thirty years has been destroyed in one pathetically constructed alternate reality.

3,Waterpik cascadia,"The product is great. The vendor is questionable. Product recieved was a customer return. It was repackaged very poorly and broken. I repaired it quickly and am using it.The bottomline is when retailing a product err on the side of the customer. When you recieve a return, defect it out and get credit from the manufacturer. Don't let the end used get it."
1,HORRIBLE,I didn't even have the shower head for 24 hours and the neck of it broke.Save your money and get something else.
1,Gross!!!,This grows mold because all the water does not drain out of it after each shower. Too gross! Don't buy- we are replacing ours asap.
1,Cheap materials ruin this product,"In a word this is junk. The flexible arm is too weak to support the large rainfall head. From day one it wanted to droop down and not stay in place. If I managed to get it in the desired position it only took the slightest touch to make it fall back down - forget about the button for spray selection. It's very disappointing considering I had an older ""gooseneck"" shower head from Waterpik that worked without any issues, but it seems they decided to go with a cheap design that renders this product essentially unusable."
5,Love mine,"I love this shower head. It took me two minutes to install, and it works great. I just set it up as high toward the ceiling as it would go, set it on rain, and haven't touched it since. I love the feeling of the water ""raining down"" zero problems here."
2,Not very well made,"Of course it works great - for as long as it works. After some time, my unit develped a leak. Unlike better showerheads, the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time, causing the seals to not set properly, resulting in the kind of leak mine developed. Unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years, I'd stay away fom this model. And good luck navigating Watrepik's website to get any help."
4,We like it...,"I love taking long showers, so I think the showerhead is an important part of the experience. This one is really nice because the rain setting really does feel like rain. Some people say the water pressure on this setting doesn't rinse the soap off, but if you stand out in the rain, wouldn't you have a hard time rinsing soap off? The setting is for those of us who really just enjoy standing under the water. The 2nd setting is for rinsing the soap off. And for how easy it is to switch back and forth, I wouldn't be complaining. No problems with the product sagging or leaking at our place. Good product!"
2,Works great if you don't need to adjust it.,"Like many other reviewers, I'm having the same issue with this; the arm can't support the shower head. It was great for a few months but after adjusting and readjusting the shower head a few times, the shower head won't stay put."
2,Short Life-span.,The Cascadia is hard to get it to stay where you want it. The button that changes the spray pattern broke after about 3 months and is not repairable. Poor plastic construction. I won't buy another one.
2,Nice product but flawed,"We are now on our third showerhead in the past 6 months. Waterpik has been great about replacing the units, but, finally, enough is enough. We did not have a problem with sagging, but did have issues with the switch for spray/shower breaking (all three did), which then created a leaking problem. As we speak, only the center spray position works. The breakage occurs after about 4-6 weeks of use. We have 5 people taking showers every day, which may be the problem with the showerhead.Overall, an under-engineered product for moderate to heavy residential use."
1,Terrible,"I returned this showerhead the day after I purchased it. The flexible arm is pathetic. I had to fiddle with the thing for 10 minutes just to get it to hold the showerhead up. Then as soon as you tap the showerhead, it falls back down. Ridiculous. Water-Pik should be ashamed of themselves."
2,This was a letdown.,"I received this as a gift for Christmas and was very anxious to install it and try it out. While the spray itself felt great and I liked that fact that it can be switched from a wide, gentle spray to a concentrated spray, it was overall very disappointing. The arm is not strong enough to hold the head up well - even without the water running. Water also leaks out of the switch that is used to change the spray. We plan on returning this one and purchasing something else."
3,Workable - Not as good as my last one,"Purchased an earlier model of this item. It had great water flow, durability and was made better. This one still has great water flow, but flimsy. So, it is better than others I have tried at 3 times the price - but I am not sure how long it will last."
2,Disappointing,"For a company with a good reputation, I'm very disappointed in Waterpik. The large showerhead is quite heavy and the gooseneck can barely support its weight, so unless you can mount it fairly high up on the wall, the showerhead won't stay at a proper horizontal angle. Or it will stay up for a while, then slowly sag. It has recently developed an annoying whistle; those holes are tiny, so they are probably clogged, but how does one clean this unit since it doesn't come apart? Stay away from this one, and buy something else."
4,It's made a big difference!,"I live in an apartment and have a TERRIBLE water heater! I could barely take a 5 minute shower w/o having to jump out before I froze to death. Even though I tried turning the heater up, It still didn't make much a difference. My fiance and I registered for this shower head, and got it as a wedding gift. We love it! It saves so much water that we can now both actually get showers, and be able to enjoy them. I would definitely recommend this one. It hasn't drooped at all either. The only thing I would maybe change about it would be the pressure. We went from having very hard pressure to just moderate. I wouldn't trade it for anything though!"
1,WaterPik Cascadia Showerhead,"WaterPik Cascadia Showerhead is not worth the price. Asother users have stated it will start to sag. It also does not deliver the water pressure one wants from a routine shower. I also found the head clogged easily. Not even going to mess with the warranty, but it was replaced as of tonight."
2,Spend the money toward a better one,I bought this for my nephew. He loved it functionally. On a visit just 9 months later I was visiting and had a chance to use it. He had to rig a support for the gooseneck to keep it focused on him. This had broken just a few months into his ownership. I bought him the S-style from Amazon.com at a greater price and it's worth every penny. He loves it and it has a much greater span of spray plus range of motion on the head movement.
1,It might be drenching if you were a leprechaun,"But if you're a normal-sized person, this is nothing like the ""Sunflower"" (can-type) drenching spa showers. My home has great water pressure and terrific water flow, and using this showerhead is like standing under a VERY gentle summer rain (definitely non-drenching)---it doesn't even deliver the same water flow as my normal showerhead. Go for a slightly more expensive option, like the Pegasus 8"" sunflower. I gave it a fair try (it's been in for months now), but this showerhead is not worth even its modest price; although my husband is kicking up a fuss about his installation labor, I am taking mine out and installing a different showerhead."
1,Not happy with this,"I was not happy with this at all. It would not fit my shower. I moved to a new home and it would not work there either. It was a total waste of money, but by the time I figured this out, it was too late to return."
1,Horrible!!!,This shower head just worked for about 5 days and then it broke.. I don't recommend this if you like excellent quality!!
4,Didn't sag for me.,"I've had this showerhead for over three years. I stumbled across it here on amazon because now I'm looking for a new one with a hand held option so I can wash my dog more easily in the shower. If I hadn't adopted a dog, I probably would continue using the waterpik indefinitely.After reading some of the reviews, I just wanted to chime in and say that I've never had any issue with sagging. It stays where I put it. The swiveling arm is quite sturdy and stiff, and it has always stayed in place. I only use the rain option, not the other option (where water only comes out the middle gray part at a higher pressure), which I think has rather limited utility. I think it cleans quite thoroughly in rain mode, contrary to what some other people wrote. Perhaps this depends on your water pressure, and on whether you left the flow-limiting piece in (I took it out)."
3,It's a good shower head,It's not as wide as I expected. It covers about as much as other shower heads do.3/21/2010 Update: A few months back the shower started to spray out of the top part and some of the holes don't release water anymore. I'm not as thrilled as I thought I would be about getting a Waterpik.
2,Keep Looking,"For the first few months this showerhead was great. I liked the toggle option to switch between the raining mode and the stronger center spray. Unfortunately the toggle and the showerhead housing are flimsy. I pressed the toggle button in too far and it cracked the entire housing, which caused water to spray out of both the showerhead and the showerhead base. I switched to a Delta stainless steel raining showerhead and I like it far more."
3,Nice Rain Won't Last,"I owned this for about a year and a half before the plastic mount cracked at the base and would no longer support the shower head. Here's a summary of my thoughts after ownership:Pros:- Very easy installation. Compared to other shower heads I've installed, this was one of the easiest considering its bulky design.- Rain effect is relaxing, but not too impressive.Cons:- Flexible arm does not hold the heavy shower head in position after about 6 months of normal use. Repeated adjusting may damage the plastic mounting.- Rain effect does not rinse soap off very well while showering. The second setting helps with this, but produces more of an uncomfortable sharp needle effect.Overall: Shop around for a better model this one has some quality issues."
1,Doesn't Last,"I have been using this showerhead for about a year now. At first I quite liked it. However, lately it does not switch properly between modes. Sometimes it is half and half, sometimes it dribbles out the middle. This is disappointing and means I have to replace it. I believe a showerhead should last more than a year and will no longer buy any waterpik products."
1,Waterpik CF-201 Cascadia Drenching Rain Showerhead,"Awful, like the others said, IT SAGS! It won't stay where you put it, after a while the different settings stop working, Waterpik has a great return policy but after a while you get tired of dealing with it."
2,"Looks good, but...","This product looks good but we found it to be a general dissappointment. Despite installation that included teflon tape, we could never get it to stop leaking. Also, we could never get the shower head into a comfortable position and get it to stay put. The biggest problem had to do with hard water. Although we don't have exceptionally hard water, we had to have it replaced twice in two years. The switch stopped working and we had water continually coming out of both settings. On a good note, Waterpik was very accomodating about the product warranty. I think we'll go back to something simpler and less expensive."
1,Turn around and run,"I had one for about 7 years, yes it worked great, until one day it broke and would not stay up. I ordered one just like it, when it came I put it on and used the shower one time and it did not want to stay up very good. Then my wife was taking a shower and all of all sudden it broke and would not stay up at all. We did not get two showers out of it. Will NOT order a nother one. 30 some dollars down the drain."
2,"Blah, ugly, and shower chills","It does function, but I can't say anything else pleasant about this shower head. It is ugly, it is very hard to adjust the height (stiff arm, limited ROM) and it has a small circumference of water that rains down with low pressure. You can find something way better for the money. Keep looking. I made my boyfriend take it back."
2,Feels nice but poor quality.,"This showerhead is great in the beginning. The rain aspect of it is really nice. I like a more gentle spray, but with enough water to actually rinse off. This feels like water is being poured on you rather than being blasted at you. It's soothing and relaxing.However, I would not say this is a good quality showerhead. The arm that holds the head up is flimsy and constantly sinks down under the weight of the showerhead. My husband is 6'4 and I am 5'9 and we constantly have to push it back up and into place. We are actually on our second one because the first broke after only 6 or 7 months of use. The arm broke from readjusting it daily due to the sinking issue. I am not sure why, but my husband thought he should buy another one after that performance (I would not have). The second one doesn't seem to sink as much, but it still does it. I am not sure how long it will last. I don't plan to buy a 3rd (and this time my husband knows that)."
4,"A little blues, a lot of heart.",Terri Gibbs has been a favorite of mine for years. Sexy songs or sad songs - you know the feelings she's singing about. I hope to see some of her other records come to CD.
5,A Marvelous and Unrecognized Talent,"I am in the process of converting my vinyl and cassettes (291 of them)to CD track by track. I found the cassette I'd dubbed of Terri's ""Somebody's Knockin'"" album and intended to burn just the title cut. I'm glad I kept listening because there are many fine songs on that album. Right now, ""Tell Me That You Love Me"" is playing and it is a beautiful and sad song.We have all missed out on some great music because she didn't fit into a niche."
1,Very helpful,"This book by Dr Oz was very helpful, everyone should read it and apply it to yourself. He explains in easy to understand words about the dangers of your heart."
4,An unexpected side effect,"I rate this book very highly with relation to what it teaches regarding cardial care.What also struck me is a reference to what he experienced in Turkey, were Dr. Oz spent a vacation as a child or teenager. He refers to this somewhat timidly.Can you imagine: there was no toilet paper. It was explained to him, that Turkish people, like Indonesians and other Asian people refrain from rubbing an obnoxious substance into a tender skin with paper, which Western people have been led to believe represents cleaning, but rather prefer using water and their left hand.People that use their right hand's middle finger to signal derision, don't know what they are signaling about. Dr. Oz mentions, that the Eastern method of personal hygiene also diminishes the survival rate of hemorrhoids.So it would seem that the book promotes health of heart as well as of another , but less admired, part of the human anatomy. A double whammy so to speak."
2,Not For Me,I think Dr Oz is a fantastic doctor and I have heard him speak on tv but I did not find any useful information in this book for my life.
3,Not yet Synergy,"Dr. Oz is, I guess, trying to be a complementary surgeon, and he does okay in his explanations of the typical complements i.e. yoga, music, but he is still a surgeon, and his belief in surgery comes through loud and clear. Just as the ""YOU"" books are deceptive in their attempt to woo the reader into believing this is a new approach to medicine. Alternative therapies were mainstream medicine long before Oz decided to be a revolutionary. Hard to read a book based on false premises. I much prefer the truth, even it sounds to some as being ""too loving."" Read Rayna Gangi, Deepak Chopra- let these guys go be surgeons."
2,Not much practical use...,Most experienced Sysadmins recommand the use of the TC shell for interactive use and the Korn shell for writing scripts. Fine. Except that this book does not provide a good introduction to writing scripts. Even the experienced script writer will be at a loss in the details the authors go.The examples are useless: they never say what they are supposed to do and they never tell you the results.And main criticism: I have yet to find a system where the _new_ kornshell (which came out in 93) is installed...
3,good little book,"It is a good little book to give the basics on wine. Other reviews on the spiral bound book indicated that you could take notes on wines tried out. On the kindle version this is not available, but otherwise its it is handy if paired with a notebook application, where you can take notes. I have done this when going to wine tasting, easier than carrying a pen & paper."
3,good book for beginners,I am new to wine tasting and this book gave me some very good information. It will help with many wine terms.
1,Great show-horrible dvd production,"A classic show deserves a classy presentation. Where to start...poor quality 2-sided discs, bad transfer, awful compression-way too many digital artifacts.Come on Universal, give Blue the Galactica treatment.Wait for the hi-def version or just tape it off the air, the quality is roughly the same."
3,P.G. cut,"daytime edited, lots of cuts, you'll be missing the language and R. scenes. picture quality is good, but would not buy again"
5,One of the classics,"We started watching the entire series when we got our Kindle Fires. Now we have a Roku (which I highly recommend) and we are enjoying the show even more.We missed this the first time around. But I think seeing the entire series in order, sans commercials is really something special."
4,Packaging,"I bought seasons three and four as Christmas gifts this past year. The viewing quality was excellent. The flipping of discs, however, and the flimsy packaging was a bit disappointing.All in all, however, I was satisfied with this purchase.Lakewood, OH"
1,The secret opinion of a 15 year-old.,"I just found an entry in an OLD diary of mine from 1987, when I was in 9th grade. ""The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 3/4"" was required reading for my English class. Here's the impression the book left on me back then:28th April, 1987:""We started 'The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole' in English today. Boy, is it stupid.""That's the only mention I made of the book. I guess that says something..."
4,Great book,"This book is amazing! It's funny, detailed and somehow manages to keep you on a cliff hanger throughout the book. It was only after I read that chips cost 32p that I realised this book is quite old. I'm guessing it was written in 1981 or before that date so it's quite hard to get the feel of the book when everything is so cheap! That's my only complaint (it's not a very good one though!) so other than that, this book was great."
3,Other Books,"A reasonably amusing look at the life of a teenage boy, in his own hand.To him, of course, his life can seem quite horrible, problems with those annoying girls, those annoying adults, those annoying schools, those annoying things you have to do, and all sorts of other mundane things.The funny part is how he actually jots it down."
4,Summer Reading Book,"I thought the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole was a pretty good book for a summer reading choice. This book was funny, interesting, and dramatic. What I like most about this book was that it kept me interested because it was dealing with situations any kid goes through. I didn't like all the characters in the book because it sometimes made the book boring and confusing. What you would learn from this book is what goes through a teenage boy's head and what his opinions are about life. You would also understand what it's like to be a kid with parents constantly fighting, worrying about not having enough money, and your best friend going out with the same person you liked. I would also recommend this book to someone who likes reading diaries and getting inside the character's head. Overall, it wasn't the best book I've ever read, but I still didn't feel like I was dreading reading it."
5,The Funniest Book Ever Written,This book is hilarious and so true. This is a book that everyone can enjoy and relate to
2,Many unsubstantiated claims,"This book contains several wild and unsubstantiated claims:- The Bible was widely read and understood by the common man in the Middle Ages- The Roman Catholic Church made vernacular versions of the Bible widely available- There was really no need for an English version of the Bible- Roman Catholic translations are highly accurate, whereas Protestant translations are ""swarming with errors""- The Roman Catholic Bible has the exact same content as that of the early churchOf course, those who are unwilling to look into the accuracy of these claims will accept them at face value. Graham provides very few references to back up his bold claims."
5,SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD,"I had no idea what the origin of the Bible was. I was stunned to read ""Where We Got the Bible""--how logical and straight forward it really was. This book is a very quick read. I was stunned that Protestants used such ridiculous arguments against the Catholic Church (like the Catholic Church ""keeping the Bible away from the masses by chaining it up""). I was utterly unfamiliar with these objections. Since reading this book, however, I have run into these misconceptions and are able to enlighten others."
4,Interesting and easy to read,Graham's very readable account of how the Bible came to be deserves a serious reading. It challenges many anti-Catholic notions and makes a good case for the Bible's having come from the Catholic Church. This would make a good introductory text for a Catholic Bible Study.
3,"Ok, but not many in a box are that good","Although a few in a box might be performance worthy, most are not even useable. I would recommend Vandoren instead. In addition, the reeds are actually thiner than what I'm used to."
1,Poorly designed.,"I wish it were possible to give ZERO stars.My wife gave this gift to our sons for Christmas. It looked fun, and we had a good time playing it for a while, but then it became clear that there are simply not enough pipe pieces for any player to actually win the game.Save your money...or find something else"
2,Epson Inkjet Color S191089/S020191/S020089,"Epson Inkjet Cartridge (Color) for (S191089/S020191/S020089) is a great price and wasreceived byTrinity Fusion Enterprises, LLC (Texas Angel) quickly (processed by Amazon). Unfortunately the cartridge was not in retail packaging as shown. This would have been OK as I thought maybe this was OEM packing. I suspected otherwise when I found the cartridge within the external pack did not have the usual vacumm mylar sealed wrap. Also, there was no expiration date as is typical with all Epson cartridges. On the outside of the package a label with the Epson p/n's and a label that said ""New"". To be safe I did not install but returned and a refund was promptly issued."
1,RIPPED OFF!! - Empty Ink Cartridge,"I WAS RIPPED OFF!!I bought installed the ink than printed five sheets,after that there was no more ink.I tried contacting seller I got no response.They got my money which I'm sure is all they wanted,hopefully you wont make the same mistake.James"
5,Sometimes buying brand name products makes a difference,"I've tried three or four different brands (store brands and no-name) in search of the best price. I found out the hard way that with this ol' printer (Stylus 740i), the Epson inks are the most reliable and last longest. The other ink cartridges biggest drawback was lifespan. I think it's because I ended up wasting ink doing regular - almost daily, in some cases - cleaning clogged nozzles! At this point, I can't get it anywhere locally at a lower price, so Amazon was the best choice on that count also.Excelsior!-j-"
1,Kiosk Rating <1,Negatives in order:(1.) You know it's bad when the writers have to resort to the time worn and redundant storyline of corporate pollution for profits backfiring which leaves some pollution eating creatures a bit upset and revengeful.(2.) Tiresome overuse of animal carcasses.(3.) Over reliance upon night/darkness for cheap effects.(4.) Over reliance by special effects crew dragging a sled (or whatever) through the underbrush to create cheap critter moving effect. That really got to be a yawner.(5.) Over reliance by special effects crew to loop the same animal noise grunting sound for the entire movie. Became as endearing as elevator/grocery store background music.(6.) Best of all was the use of the same fake boar's head through out the entire movie although relative to moving brush and grunting sound the actual seeing of a wild piggy was only 1% of the movie anyway. How do I know it was the same piggy head because it had a tattoo of a human's head on it's rear end. Dead give-away.
5,Fun stuff,"I do math for fun, but I only like to do problems that are, well, PROBLEMS, and not just exercises. That's what this book is, a book of unique, nonroutine problems in algebra.While I've taken courses in AP Calculus and Statistics and such, I find that the problems contained in this little book re-open the avenues of precalculus mathematics and show the reader/solver what the math teachers and AP and all that jazz never could: problems that require insight, ingenuity, and diligence. Solving each problem in this book is a joy! There's always something new to be learned with each problem, even if you don't succeed.Anyway, yeah, the problems are great, the solutions lucid, and the price dirt cheap. If you want to challenge your math ability, then buy this book and spend a good amount of time doing the problems. If you want to just do well in algebra class, please redirect yourself to the Schaum's ""Algebra"" guide for more routine, classroom work."
4,"good, bit difficult","The book was a bit harder than i thought, however a little extra challenge is never too bad. Has some proofs, some logic problem solving. The reason i rated this 4 is because of where everything is placed in the book. After you solve the problem, u have to go to another page to see the answer, or if you dont enderstand the problem, u have to dig in the book to see where its solution is."
3,Cheap construction,"The principle here is that a metal slide closes in-between two other metal slides to make a good contact. The side with the two metal contacts are not that springy. I had to use a pair of pliers to close the gap. With successive operations the contacts open up and the gap widens, requiring pliers to bend back together again. It may be OK for low voltage applications, but could allow horse or livestock electric fences to arc where the contacts meet.If you need these for occasional use (troubleshooting sections of fence) then they should be OK, if you plan to use them daily then they may create problems."
4,Great stuff this...,"As a fan of Muddy Waters, and all his various band members, I really enjoyed this video, but it would have been nice if it were a tad longer. None the less, I would purchase it again, and will do so for my blues buddy's birthday, he being a Sumlin fan, also."
4,Not enough research first,"I wasn't expecting this to be strictly Scots information. I think I was looking for more ancient stuff, and this turns out to be modern remnants. On the whole, I should have checked it out from the library instead. The footnotes are the most fascinating reading of the lot."
5,progressive metal is dead?,Symphony X has to be one of the most talented and musically thought provoking bands on the planet. The guitar work is godly (this guy does it all alone?) The lyrics and vocals are nothing less than exceptional and the bass and drum work are extremely tight. These guys aren't messing around with music that is uninspired and lifeless. This is the stuff. All progressive metal fans should be paying homage to one of the more elite groups still producing the goods today. I highly recommend ALL of their cds (if u can find them). I 've also had the chance to listen to some of the latest offering from Symphony X (V) and I'm speechless. It never ends... Symphony X has set a mark for the rest of the music world to catch up to. Good luck!
5,"Repeat after me: ""I will buy this CD""","This is an absolute masterpiece. This band has been compared to Dream Threatre but trust me, they are not just a DT clone. They have there own sound and this CD is just stunning. The title track even contains guitar version of Mars: Bringer of War (an awesome classical piece). Buy it, buy it NOW!"
1,"This Pertains To This Re-Release, Not The Music!","This review pertains strictly to the re-release. These new re-releases of the Symphony X disography is a terrible concept. Inside Out records has packaged the music to where there are no individual tracks. Merely one large one. It's a bummer because you can't rip them onto your computer so that you may place any of the individual songs on a ""best of"" type CD for you car or Diskman.Go with the regular release."
2,A Disappointing Album But I Cannot Figure Out Why,"After all the hype, after all the glowing reviews about how this album is supposedly one of the great prog metal/neoclassical releases ever, I finally picked up Symphony X's The Divine Wings of Tragedy.Boy, what a let-down. It just did not ""grab"" me in any way. All the ingredients are there to make this a great album from the Dio-like vocals, and very Malmsteen-like guitar and the Queen-ish vocal harmonies and Dream Theater sound but when it comes right down to it, I didn't like this album.I'm not the biggest fan of neoclassical metal but I do like progressive metal minus the technical over-the-topness many so-called ""prog metal"" bands indulge in. The funny thing is that Symphony X's technical indulgences are, for the most part, tasteful (except for the keyboards that are a bit too much at times), I should have liked this album. But I didn't and I still can't figure it out. All the ingredients are there. Hey, maybe it was the songs. Who knows?"
5,Worth the money,"Alisha's Attic delivers another brilliant set. This import is definitely worth buying if you're a fan. As always, the voices are beautiful and the lyrics are memorable. Try it."
1,History of Lexington School for the Deaf,"I disliked because of too long details and less photos. Some missed were not in that book as I knew when I attended the school 1947-1964. I am disappointed about it. Someday, I will edit."
5,A happy customer,"This was a gift for my 16 year old daughter. She had seen the product and really wanted this piece to wear as a daily reminder of her own personal commitment. I was very pleased with how timely it arrived and the price was very reasonable. The most pleasant part of this transaction was when the ring arrived and we opened it up, it was lovely. I would not hesitate to recommend!"
5,babydoll,I bought this doll for my baby. She absolutely loves it. She loves playing with the eyes that open and close. Great quality as all Madame Alexander dolls always are.
5,"Love, Love, Love",I love this body creme! It smells so good and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. It comes in a nice big jar and is well worth the price. I bought some for my mom for mother's day and now she is asking for more for Christmas!
4,"Good, but Vol. 2 is better","Being a DNAngel-obsessed fangirl, i have both soundtracks. This volume, Volume 1, has some really good vocal songs, like Whenever, and Fanatic, as well as the TV versions of the fantastic opener, True Light, and the closing, Gentle Afternoon. The other 29 songs are the music. some are short, some are long, some annoying, some beautiful. If you're looking for the vocal songs, try the drama CDs. If you're looking for good music that you can say ""oh, i remember that scene"" while you're listening to it, get this CD."
2,cute but ........,"Because the gloves are knit they do not give you much protection from weeds and plants that you would not want to grab with your bare hands, like thistles or anything with prickers (ouch). Weeds also stick to the gloves. After wearing them to plant tomatoes and dig around in the dirt today my hands are as dried out as they would have been without using gloves at all.The colors are fun but don't expect much more protection for your hands than if you were wearing a knit fashion glove."
1,"Where Did This Writer Come From, Mars?","As in the book description states: Billions of beings congrfolling tghe universe will make themselves known to earths inhabitants beginning [this year, 1997.] This is 1999 and NU? Did we miss something with Hale Bopp Comet and the other nutz who killed themselves to get on the space ship. I must have been in a coma. The writer also. I only read what's printed in Amazon.com reviews. ""Hollywood"" must still be sucking weeds."
3,You had to be young at the time...,"Sure, they are stupid-Eurovision like music, but if you were young at the mid 90s and lived in germany, you can't have missed them..."
5,kicks ass,"I am from Germany and live in the States since two years.This CD reminds me on home and the people I lived with,those girls are from my area,they even sing with our dialekt.It is awesome that we can order german music over you guys."
1,If you like music that is good you just won't like this...,If you like good hip hop do not get this album. I am sure there is much better German rap out there so go look for it elsewhere...this is really cheesy with 80's dance type beats that are rather cliche. Don't waste your time here.
4,Nice low-key style,"I like Tequila Sheila and Private Malone. This is not the Nashville ""ready-for-radio"" sound, but it's real nice country music."
2,Mojo Jojo's Rising,"The book was fine. It was as described. But, I did not receive the book for over a month after the order date. I had to send an e-mail to the seller asking where it was. I did not receive any e-mail explanation in return, but did receive the book about a week later. I still don't know why it took so long for me to receive it."
1,very unhappy,"we are not able to play this dvd on our player, we receive the message ""Region Error"" and it will not play at all, very disappointed"
1,dissatisfied,I am very disappointed with this movie I am a truckdriver and enjoy watching a movie while on down time this movie will not play except in my home area code it says eject now outside viewing area this is unexceptable i sent an email and didnt even get an acknownedgment
1,Rotten Deal,"I ordered the movie series Shogun for my wife (for Christmas)to watch with her mom. I didn't go into the description, I just clicked on the first one that came up, so true it is my bad. It arrived and she put it on the shelf to watch later. When she opened it up it turns out to be a region 2 movie which will not play on US or Canadian DVD machines. If people are going to sell stuff that won't work in the US, they ought to email you and say, ""are you sure you want this?"" It cost nearly $40 and we are just out the money as they won't refund this late. I will NEVER order anything from MOVIE MARS again."
2,Read carefully,"I picked this up, thinking it would help tell me about Celtic sites to see, for an upcoming visit. My mistake-- totally useless for that.The Scotland video-- which is sort of a history of the Scotish soldier-- is the best of the lot. Lots of reenactment footage and commentary, though one of the ""historical speakers"" made us think of ""Tim the Enchanter"" from the Monty Python Grail movie. Mostly it's a good video.The Wales one is feeble-- lots of shots of a bearded guy, pretending to be the single great Welsh leader (so it would seem) standing on a hill side thinking. After the 12th take of this same shot... well, it was tedious. About 25% interesting stuff and the rest filler, it seemed. The Britain video is also filled with lots of silly druid types, with a few actually good actors doing readings from the period. They are well done, if a bit overlong.Overall, it's a collection I'll put in the bargin bin."
4,Food for thought for global strategists.,"I put this book in my briefcase for reading on a recent overseas flight. I found it to be very interesting, especially where Professor Oliver describes how successful companies must operate in the 21st century. I am a strong advocate of quality customer service. I like his concept that huge national markets may disappear and be replaced by billions of individual customers whose needs must be fulfilled for a company to be successful. John R. Jagoe, Director, Export Institute."
5,SNFU,"Awesome CD! mint condition. This is probably one of their best albums, I would recommend it to anyone who loves punk!"
4,Fills quite a void in the automotive hobby,"This book was needed years ago. Now we have it. It is chock full of good stuff about AMC's cars, which were the also-rans of the American automotive industry. However, AMC did mighty well, thank you, and the cars in the book reflect that. The biggest gripe about the book are the photographs. Many are rather poor in quality- it almost seems the author took them himself instead of relying on a professional. Still, I think this is a book that will complement any collection."

1,So Disappointed,"This album is truly bad. The arrangements are silly, and the recordings are overproduced. Liz' voice quavers as if she's got the worst stage fright of her life. I was so looking forward to the richness of tone she exhibits in the Sibling Revelry and Boom albums. But not to be found here."
4,BONUS TRACKS MAKE ADD ALOT TO THIS RECORD,"This is probably FODs weakest offering, only three real standouts ""This Is It"", ""Teenaged Godhead"" and ""I dismanteled the clock"". The production seems to just be a little off on this, with thin drum sounds and scrathy guitars. The Bonus Track are very funny, ""Bonus Track"" and ""Bonus Track Woman"" both crack me up. The real treat on this CD is the inclusion of the Love Songs 7"" from the early 80's. If the love songs EP was on CD alone it would get 5 stars, but the down with people album is a 3, so I gave it 4 stars. FOD classics like ""POWERLOAD"", ""MEAT FACTORY"" and ""MURDER CASTLE"". Every time I see this band someone yells for them to play powerload, and they almost always do it. Get this and if you dont like the record, just skip to the last 7 songs."
4,Excellent Pre-Beatles 1960s Listening,"I heard this album while browsing around a downtown record store and was moved to buy it. Most of the songs are strong, only a few sound dated and one really stinks. Tempo & Stevens' version of ""Stardust"" is the best I've ever come across. This music belongs in your collection."
2,CD entitled The Best of Nino Tempo & April Stevens,"I bought this CD for one song, ""Deep Purple."" It was worth the price. The other songs were so - so, but I didn't mind the rest."
4,"Derivative bubblegum, slight nostalgia, but lots of energy","I don't see how anyone can say there's only 1 good song here, ""All Strung Out"" and ""The Coldest Night of The Year"" are fabulous, jazzy pop just as good as the no.#1 hit ""Deep Purple"". ""I Can't Go On Livin'"" is very much in the Righteous Brothers vein, as is ""You'll Be Needing Me Baby"". ""Paradise"" and ""Whispering"" never quite achieve their pop ambitions, but ""Teach Me Tiger"" is terrific camp. Overall, a nice souvenir of another era. But it's missing one of their best songs, ""Land of 1,000 Dances"", for which they did a Kinescope video!"
1,"Someone has a whack definition of ""Like New""","I received the package in a reasonable time frame. I was so excited to get it finally. I opened it, the jewel case was questionable but not cracked and the sleeve seemed in good condition. I was optimistic.I immediately put it in my car player. I wouldn't play. I double checked that all settings were fine. It didn't play. I ejected it and replaced the previous cd to make sure it could play and the other cd played just fine. I then turned the recently purchased cd over to see if it might have a hair or piece of fuzz on it and was appalled.The cd was more scratched than I had seen any CD since cd's came out....as if it had lived out of its case on the floor of someone's car for a couple years. (advertised ""Like New"")The problem now is I am simply out the money. It would cost more to return this CD to a seller I would never purchase from again than the initial cd cost to begin with.Ridiculous!!!"
1,Very little information within,I saw THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALLEN GINSBERG DVD and a lot of that film ended up in this very short British TV version without any extras. I think that the over 8 hour DVD that this is paired with (85 minute film and over 6 hours of amazing extras) gives the viewers much more value for their time and money. If you buy both you are wasting your money in my opinion.
1,Didn't live up to legend,"Back when this originally was issued, it was an expensive and rare album to come by. I'd never heard it, but being quite the Monkees fan, I was anxious to hear it, and felt sorry I didn't go see them when the toured the US. Once the CD finally came out 20 years later, I realized (as happens more often than not) I didn't miss a thing. As has been stated, the album is horribly recorded - I've heard better audience tapes! The performance is pathetic. These guys should have been ASHAMED at their performance. It's no wonder the project didn't continue. It was an abomination, and an insult to the great original work they did together. A lot of times, the legend of a recording is more exciting than the recording itself. This is a prime example. Unless you can get it for free, don't bother with this one."
3,wow,"Although this isn't the greatest album, I think it's a must for Monkee fans. Aside from the fact that it's it's Micky and Davy, The addition of Boyce and Hart adds another level. Also of great interest is a song written by Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz. ""Saving my love."" I'm a Nez fan but I definitely like this CD."
3,Trying to Get Things Going,"Though the band name was not (could not) be used, The Monkees are essentially brought back as former band members Mickey Dolenz - who spearheaded the comeback - and Davy Jones team with chief songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, producing a studio album and this 1976 live set from Japan.Perhaps with a lot to prove to an entertainment industry that used the group like a concert ticket - toss it in the trash after the show is over - Dolenz and Jones solidly deliver the goods. While there is more pop in the pop rock, the timing may have been off; a few years later The Monkees had a revival during a new wave that swept pop culture, as the song, (I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone, became a concert standard for any number of punk bands, including the Sex Pistols.This band was through within a year, but briefly showed the potential of trying to get back into the music game, minus the sugary bubblegum."
1,BAD BAD BAD!!!!!,THIS IS NOT THE MONKEES IN MY BOOK AND YOU WILL NOT LIKE THE WAYTHESE SONGS ARE SUNG!! STICK WITH THE MONKEES LIVE SUMMER TOUR CDTHATS GREAT!!
2,With this hefty price tag.....,"....comes hefty disappointment. Andis is a good brand of clipper, ""however"" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much. The power is weak and it takes about 24 hours to fully charge.These clippers are not designed for professional use at all. I am not a barber, my wife cuts my hair every 2 weeks or so. It does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine.However it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. My wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.My recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of Andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying I agree with the first guy that reviewed this product."
4,fighting terrorism and stupidity.,The story starts off when members of The Code Name Team are invited by a billionaire computer maker to attend a function as a reward for doing him a favor. Just so happens at this time multiple terrorist attacks are under way across America. The Code Name Team are in the middle of an attack to extort money from the rich people at the party. The Code Name Team defuses the situation. Then Senator Harriet Clayton (former 2nd lady) thinks she can negotiate with the terrorist of the Islamic Jihad Muhahidins' leader Abdul Kadan Kazar. She foolishly goes to their home turf of Sitarkistan and she is kidnapped. The Goverment won't negotiate and can't be seen to get involved for political reasons and thus asks for help from the Code Name Team. While the rescue mission is going on political games are played when someone leaks info about the mission that could jeopardize the mission. The Code name Team continues on and you'll have to read the book to find out how it goes.
2,What a joke,"I haven't quite finished this book yet (and I don't know if I even will), but I just have to say that this book is laughable. A filthy-rich computer-and-software mogul named Gil Bates? A woman named Harriet Clayton, whose husband had been a governer and then voted into the White House for two terms (as VP) but who was plagued by sex scandals, and the woman then ran for Senator. Does this all sound somewhat familiar?This story would have been better if the writer had actually used his own imagination to create new and believable characters, rather than using thinly-veiled versions of real people. His opinions are very obvious, and if he wanted to write a book to make jabs at public figures he doesn't like, he should have done that.Oh, and the plot of this story? So far it just seems to be a rehashing of post-9/11 military and political actions."
5,Web Chair repair,"We have one of those now hard to find web folding aluminum chairs, and were really happy to find this product so we could repair our chair instead of sending it to landfill. Works well."
5,Great product. Easy to use.,Easy to use and glad I could still get it to repair old aluminum chairs. I would order againn if I had the need.
4,Irish Eyes Are Smiling,"A worthy subject a bit too 'worthily' approached. Lots of the writing in this book of essays edited by James Mackillop is stodgy and pedestrian. Shining exception is Harlan Kennedy, whose article 'Shamrocks and Shillelaghs' is full of colour, wit, detail and revealing connections. He also covers an ambitious swathe of Irish film history: a four-star effort that alone makes the book worth looking at. A shamrock to him. A shillelagh to everyone else!Jill Smith"
1,to shallow,"I have Sint's book on wedding photography which is a gem. It is packed with information and beautifull pictures.Compared to Sint's book, this one is a huge disappointment. This book has very, very little information and even that is so superficial that it is of no use.There are so many things that could have been presented in this book. For example regarding equipment it would have been usful to see a discussion of digital back's for medium format cameras vs digital SLR's or a discussion of camera resolution vs print quality. Instead the level of information you get is like ""the more megapixels the better""!!! Well I don't need to read this book to came to this conclusion.And this is for every topic in the book.I am sorry but for me this book was absolutely of no use at all."
2,Not good enough,This book only gives 4 photo samples and techniques!!!So don't buy this book if you want to get inspiration in composing wedding digital photo!!!!I am very very regret buy this book!!!
1,One of the worst!,"This is a book about marketing NOT photography! If you want to know about the business side of it, this is the book to get, otherwise forget it. It's a waste of money!"
3,Good technical advice but...,"I disagree with the sales/marketing methods described in this book. The sales tactics described are borderline ""high-pressure"" if you ask me. The author recommends getting the clients into the studio for 3-4 hours some time after the event to proof the images and assemble an album. And it even offers sample phone conversation scenarios on how to head off couples that ask to review the proofs at home at their convenience. The book states that you want the client to make an ""emotional"" buy rather than a practical one. Well, that's great for the photo studio - but not so great for the client. There is already enough stress that goes along with the typical wedding. I think the photo studio should not add to this stress with high pressure sales tactics."
2,unfortunately it's disappointing...,"This book does have a few useful tidbits. For instance, it explains how to speak about digital photography to your clients so they see it as an advantage/so they feel that they are getting more than they would if you shot with film. Most of the book is not helpful, though. For instance, it includes the advice that one does not buy on credit and wind up paying interest on purchases. It includes a chart listing the hours of the day, which the reader can use to plan his or her schedule. Overall, there's not a lot of useful info in the book."
5,A captivating performance by all!,This video gave me goosebumps! Seeing some of my favorite pop/rock singers performing with my favorite tenor was so exciting. I almost cried when Jon Bonjovi sang! A must see and hear for every music lover!
5,A must have for any music lover. The spectacle of the decade,"If you appreciate superb instrumental composition combined with the most incredible melding of vocalists, capped off with a phenomenal visual treat, then this is the video to watch. The most refreshing and creative musical experience in years."
5,superb!,Listening to it is indeed exciting--majestic like one is ascending the Alps!Highly recommended...
1,B is for Bad Book,"I also was very disappointed that this book included U for Ugly. I can't imagine who would want to teach their child to call anything ugly, including someone's dog. Not a lesson I am comfortable sharing with my child; I will be returning this book."
1,Buy a nice MP3 player instead and save money,"I purchased two Juiceboxes last Christmas for my children, 8 and 12 yrs old. The selection of videos is paltry at best. I purchased the MP3 Starter kit for both on sale. To download music at faster than snail's pace, I added the cost of a 128 card for the music and the JuiceBox Pro MP3 Ripper to download music faster. My daughter listened to it once or twice. She gave up because the batteries always died. My son decided it was too big to cart around. What a waste of money. For the money I spent on these dust catchers, I could have a nice MP3 player with better features."
3,its ok,"it holds about 10 songs it wasnt that great cause the chips has to stick out its not good at all if you compare it to a ipod cause a ipod can hold 1,000 songs and this can hold 10 songs but its ok for a kid who desnt have a ipod and the pictures dont so up very well on the juicebox i like my ipod a lot better then the juicebox"
5,GOOD MONEY SPENT ON A GOOD ITEM!!!,THIS IS SO COOL! some people think that it can only hold like 4 songs right......WRONG......this thing can hold 34 Mega Bytes and a 4 minute song is like 2 Mega Bytes so dont say anything about not havin not enough memmory y'all. and if you fill up that memmory you can buy a seperate media chip and they are not that expensive so thank for mattle for creating this juicebox and mp3 starter kit and to amazon.com for selling yhis for only twent seven dollars.
5,Great Help,"This book has been a great help so far. Although I'm not a hard gamer like some of the other reviewers, I've found this useful in helping to track down dressspheres and garment grids so I can fully enjoy all that the game has to offer."
1,Disgusted!,"I was fortunate I didn't follow this guidebook.After reading it, I was disgusted with the publisher and author.It's very obvious they didn't put enough effort in making this guide.Compared to the Japanese strategy guide (FFX-2 Ultimania), they really should be ashamed of themselves. The Japanese authors spent 10s of 1000s of hours replaying the game to make sure what they wrote are without any mistakes and contains ALL the information the readers need.But this book is not only full of mistakes, it's missing important information (such as a guide to the underground dungeon) and doesn't have enough references between chapters.It doesn't even tell you where to get each accessary or item, they just listed them, and pretend that's enough.Don't trust those descriptions on the back of the book, this guidebook will only misguide you."
3,"Seller fantastic, Book...not so much","The shipping was fast and the product arrived in lovely condition. However the book itself was poorly written, and if you're buying this I STRONGLY recommend reading the mini games section first as the only way to see the entire ending of the game is if you complete some of these things, a fact which is not mentioned until well AFTER you're 1/4 of the way through the book itself. I was very satisfied with the purchase, but as most of you know FF isn't a short wham-bam game and it was horribly disappointing that after getting 15-16 hours in we realized we'd be watching the end of the game on youtube anyways =p Also, there were still parts that were explained in such uncertain terms we ended up using the internet to find the answers anyways. A die hard FF fan....I was extremely disappointed in Dan Birlew's product this time."
3,"Great game, guide could've been better...","I tell you, I LOVE this game, but the guide is not that well organized. It provides TOO much info, without giving readers easy and clear access to the info they are really looking for. I've also found few ""errors"" in the guide that I have not seen in any other Bradygames guides. I own quite a few, and the guide to FFX and Kingdom Hearts were quite exceptional. Now, I understand that the game is a nonlinear game, but they could've at least put in an index or table of contents to make finding info about a particular subject easy to find. I also found a few spelling errors. It almost seems they rushed the guide. Great images and some easy to follow maps, but otherwise, you can find better walkthroughs for free on the internet."
1,SUCKS!,NOT ONLY THE GAME SUCKS! THIS STRATGEY GUIDE SUCKS! ok let me tell ya why...later in the game you cant go back and finish what you want to gain the 100% done...well this guide SCREWS YOU OVER later in the game that they should have mention earlier to complete...horrible! NO STAR IF I COULD
2,Missing Info.,"You'll find using the 100% completion guide in the back the most helpful.But you won't find how to get all garment grids or the best accessories in the game. And the worst part of this guide is There is absolutely NO INFO on the Bevelle Dungeon, None!Even if you have this book you'll still find yourself heading to gamefaqs trying to find how to get tips, accessories, and missing garment grids."
3,"Does okay with help, but...","I got this because FFx-2 is such a huge game that I needed some help getting through it. Although the strategy guide does help, it's a little disorganized. For example, I used the guide from the moment I started the game to get those small, special things that I might otherwise miss.. I get near the end of the game and the strategy guide points out that if I had done something in every chapter from the beginning of the game that I would have been able to get a hidden prize. That would have been great if they had told me at the beginning of the book instead of at the end when it was far, FAR beyond too late.Other than that, the guide helped me out a lot to get through the basics of the game."
4,Good but False,"I have been a FF person all my life, so I had to get the game and the book. Dan Birlew is one of my most favorite authors in the Stragedy guide book section, but this was one of his worst. Unlike Kingdom Hearts, he made many flaws, and a couple not true statements. Although the bestiary and guide through the game is good, he doesn't show all the main characters like Nooj, Gippal, or Baralai for instance. Also in the guide an error is in the part to get a book for that big thing in Djose in chapter 5. Many errors were also made especially in the mini-games section. Although it is a complete guide and gives a walkthrough through the whole thing except for the last battle in the game which is against Shuyin and the guide for 100% part were not in there and flawed, I gave it a 4 star rating for it because I've seen other guide books and believe me, either I couldn't understand them, or they didn't give enough information."
2,Yeah....,"This guide was really hard to follow, but I suppose that would be expected since there are many things to do in the game in no particular order. But still...this is pretty terrible. There is a lot of crucial information that is left out of this guide. Of course, if you were to go online for a walkthrough, there would be things left out or incorret. However, getting a guide online would be free. Really, don't bother with this, unless you have the money to spare. The pictures and presentation are pretty, but that's about it.\"
4,"Good, but could be better","This guide is worth it for the one place consolidation of everything in it and the maps. You can get most everything and more online through FAQs, but they are not organized as user friendly in my opinion. Helpful in the game."
5,Awsome,"Final Fantasy is a great game to play, it's full of action, adventure, comedy, and other stuff. the Guild book help out a ton give you everything you need to know to beable to beat the game to its fullest. Gives you all the Dresssphere and Garment grids for you to collect throughout the game. All the key items and normal items for the characters, all the equipment for Yuna,Rikku,and Paine to use against enemies. A complete and awsome guild to all the bosses in the game. So I recommend this book to anyone who loves this game."
4,FFX-2 Strategy Guide Review,"It's pretty hard to make a near perfect strategy guide. There's so much information that at some point the authors are going to make an error. With that being said, this guide comes as close to that perfection as any guide I've used recently. The only guide I can think of that I would have ever given a 5 star rating to would be the FF7 unofficial strategy guide."
4,Must Have To Win,"A vivid fan of Final Fantasy, I've come to realize that if I want my sanity to stay intact, I need strategy guides to pull through. Especially with this game (and it's younger half, FFX), you need to have a guide unless you like a long, time consuming, challenging experience. Some people like playing it for real and figuring out the puzzles themselves, but even with the guide, the game gives the same amount of satisfaction and excitement.This guide should answer any question, explain every concept and go into depth on the subjects most of us skip over. It perfectly spells out what you need to do and how.From my own experience, the game and the guide come short of the pair of the FFX game. But the game is definitely worth playing! And without the guide, you're on your own!"
4,Very useful,"This is your guide to battling a successful battle! Lots of helpful tips and hints, no matter how great a Final Fantasy gamer you are, you will still benefit from this."
3,good price but a little falsley led.,"I wanted the strategy guide for final fantasy x-2 and I got that. But the description clearly stated that the book comes with a poster. And i wouldn't have been upset about it, if the description wouldn't have said it.But other than that i got the product as promised."
5,A little Note.,"Ive always found the guide usefull for the maps, dress spears, and enemy list. Ive been using the guide one and off since it first came out and when i played the game and followed the guide only and didnt play off on my own, Ive always done better."
2,doesn't cover all 100% of the game.,"This guide doesn't cover all 100% of the game, so you won't be able to see the final ending. There is alot missing, But if you want to just blow through the game, the guide if fine. (The game is kinda hard if you don't do all the optional ""monster"" missions, they train your people alot. So i recomend doing all of the game, or it's too short.)"
1,such a waste of paper!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,ok well lets see this game has no information at all it sucks and sometimes i think how is this the official guide when it does not tell you squat oh and for those descriptions on the back of the book they are absolutly incorrect 100% completion guide my a** why cant brady games use their brains hello 350 sheets of you think that would help i bet your wondering how are the japenese guides better because they spend 100s to even thousands of hours cheking just to see if your gonna do this or that mission right and what is up with their price $15.99 and further more they do not even tell you where the items are jeeze and the ffx guide was completley excellent im sorry to say Dan Birlew your a f@$%!.
5,Attitude Adjustment? A MUST!,"This is a MUST for any Attitude Adjustment fan. It includes all sixteen original tracks from the ""American Paranoia"" released on Pusmort vinyl in 1986, AND ten bonus tracks from the 1985 ""Dead Serious"" tape. The quality of the ten bonus tracks are quite exceptional for what was originally a taped recording. The sound quality is great all around!"
4,Classic.,"American Paranoia is in many ways right up my alley. Politically conscious hardcore performed at light speed, its a relic of a time long gone. As much as I like this album the real treat to me are the demo tracks included. I can imagine Pushead's interest in getting A.A. on his label after hearing them. Which would lead me to my only complaint. While American Paranoia is a classic album, and you need it, it comes across across as a tad over produced. The demo blows it away! (much like cryptic slaughters Life in Grave demo compared to convicted) While it's nice to hear every cymbal crash, every strum of the guitar, it ultimately takes away from the overall brutality. That being said, American Paranoia is essential listening for any fan of speedcore/thrash/hardcore. Its a great album, just a little polished for my taste."
5,Great 80s hardcore band,This is a great 80s hardcore band. I love this cd. 26 songs is pretty good. most of the songs are relatively short. Too bad i never got to see them live. If you like Agnostic Front you would like this band.
2,Great Jackson Album,"This album is great, and there are so many resons for that. For one thing, this album was ENTIRELY produced by the 3T themselves (except for Lionel's Stuck On You) + they are Jackson's!12 great tracks + an excellent remix of the great upbeat 'Sex Appeal'.This is a must have for any Jackson fan.If you are not a Jackson listener then this is not for you."
4,No reviews? lol!,"I think this album is pretty good. I'm shocked it has no reviews, considering they are the nephews of famour Michael Jackson.Some songs are really worth listening in this album, especially:Sex AppealStuck on YouIts a ShameVery good album with Jackson style!"
3,Ehh...it's okay,"Expect much of the same from the first album. The first time I listened to the album in its entirety, I thought amateur. As you listen to it more and more, it grows on you a bit. It's okay but not great."
3,I can live without it ~,It leaves a nice smell on your hair and that's pretty much it~ Doesn't do well on calming the hair down.
4,Great Voice + Great Songs = Great CD,"If you like Webbers music and a good female vocalist then this albums by the this late actress and caberet performer is a good bet. Laurie chose a wide variaty ranging from the often covered and the more rate songs like Starlight Express and Half a Moment. She has a strong rich voice and does justice to such belting classics as With One Look, Memory, and Love Changes Everything which I think is her most powerful performence on this CD. Unlike Sara Brightman she does not reach those upper octaves so you can hear these songs in a more subdued setting. Some of the arrangments do stray from what I am used to on the cast recordings, but they are good arangements. Who wants a carbon copy of someone elses version. This fifteen track should serve as an introduction to her recording work and A.L. Webbers if you don't know his stuff. Laurie will be missed!"
4,Highly Recommended for All Audiences,"Corporate Vampires is in its own genre to say the least. I've never seen a film like it. The informational content is more than enough to catch my interest, yet it has a dark humor that breaks the monotony and gives you a good laugh.I strongly encourage everyone to check out this DVD. You'll be surprised what you'll come to realize about the world we live in. And that it has been right in front of you all along."
3,Ok but not groundbreaking.,"Vitoria bless her soul tried to put an effort for a solo career,but she really cant pull it off. True it has some high points but its nothing that really grabs you. Its nice to listen to for a few times but afterward it just collects dust. Victoria is quite boring for the most part and she should really stick to dance tunes and lay off those pathetic ballads. IOU,Every part of me is just unbarable. A must have for a spice girl fan."
2,Posh Spice needs Spice,"This album was panned before it even came out and poor Victoria has had a lot to deal with. Money, fame, celebrity status... oh, the woes of being a Spice Girl. Oh course, there's the occasional remark about lacking talent and lip-synching too.Straying from the usual pop and trying her hand at lite R'n'B, Mrs. Becks fails miserably. Jam packed with limp mid-tempo, trite R'n'B ditties, this album is definately one of the weaker solo debuts from the Spice Girls.Nonetheless, deliteful indulgances include Midnight Fantasy, I Wish and Unconditional Love. Other than that, there's not much to work with, although if you like songs dedicated to the Beckhams, check out IOU and Every Part of Me."
4,Nice CD!!!,"Welll Welllll Wellllllllll! After reading all of your reviews, I decided to buy this album. I am very glad I did... I got it last week, and I haven't stopped playing the CD yet! The album starts off with a nice hit, entitled ""Not Such An Innocent Girl"", which you would never imagine even a Spice Girl singing... It reminds me of Jennifer Lopez's ""If You Had My Love""... Which are two great songs. My favorite track would have to be ""Midnight Fantasy""... it is a fast-pace sord of romance song. Like Melanie B's ""Hot"", this is a great CD you should pick up. If you looked at Victoria in the Spice Girls before, and you saw absolutely nothing in this, this will absolutely blow your mind, and have you saying ""WOW!"" over and over again. Buy this CD... It's awesome and you will not be dissapointed!!!"
3,Nothing new or interesting,"Ok so she can sing but when I listened to this album on a plane journey (because there was nothing else) I enjoyed the first few tracks but after the 3rd track it gets boring and starts getting annoying because there isn't anything new or experimental in tracks. You feel as if you've heard the melody off other R&B/Pop Artists, I suggest you buy this if you're a Spice girls Fan"
1,Pathetic attempt at a solo gig,"I understand everyone has the right to their opinion, but this was worst than Milli Vinili. If I were to choose the singing vocals between Victoria Beckham a.k.a. Posh Spice, I would give back the grammys' to Milli Vinnili. Thank goodness this crap isn't being blasted on the airwaves in the U.S. I did listen to all the samples, but with much pain. I wanted to be at least fair minded, but for all our sakes, Posh will only be remembered as a ""Spice"" girl. I couldn't give the rating I wanted to, but since this is a scale with a lowest number of 1, this will have to do. Enough said...."
1,ABSOLUTLY CRAP! DISASTER! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH HER!,"what can i say about a total and uptight,low life, very tasteless music, cannot sing at all, trying to be better than Kylie Minogue, and thinking she can get away with it.I listened to her album before i bought Kylies album and let me tell you the truth, i went back to the store and asked for a refund but the store would not let me and did you know what i did? I basically asked the girl to swap it for Kylie's ""Fever"" album.The album is basically trying to become a Celine Dion TRY HARD and the irony of it all is that the album was not selling well and who would blame anyone, it is like a girl trying to be a singer with the most copied melodies you could ever think of!ONE LINE REVIEW:BUY KYLIE MINOGUE ""FEVER"" IT BEATS VICTORIA BECKHAM ANYTIME.And antoher thing, watch out for her, if you see Victoria Beckham, give her the Kylie album ""FEVER."
4,Thirteen: the apollo flight that failed,Great book I have read it and reread it a few times. Great story of Apollo 13 I could not find my copy so I ordered a new one. Only thing missing is there are no photos of the flight and the people it's about. for that I give it only 4 out of 5 stars.
2,Not What I Expected,"When I ordered this item, the advertised product came with 6 finders, not the 4 finders in the present model. However, the box has an outside warning label stating that the item inside may not match the picture outside due to ongoing improvements.... Apparently 4 is better than 6.That's actually OK because the tags that you attach to your remote or keys or whatever are really quite large. I really don't feel inclined to attach many of them to anything."
1,Do Not Purchase,I rated it 1 star because 0 stars was not an option.The problem is they stop working and stop working very fast. I have check and changed the batteries. The problem is in the electronics. The four units all broke with in a few months. Sharper Image did replace them under warrenty. Two of my new set of 4 have already broke over a one month period.
5,Great stuff,"For the price, this is great. Smells nice--very subtle. Can be used as a body spray. Much better than Axe or Blade. The US versions of this are just too ascertive. This has no alcohol, does not stain. This is great. Period."
2,"Terrible sound quality. Tinny, high pitched, hurt to listen",Great comedy. Love Ted as the jerk he is. Good cast. Only complaint was the terrible sound. Why so lousy
5,Mary Tyler Moore,"This could be one of the very best situation comedy series ever. I remember being upset when it was ended. I go back now and watch these and am very excited again. Some of the best characters ever came out of this show. Among them are Mr. Grant, Sue Ann Nivens, Rhoda, Phyllis Lindstrom, of course Mary and other fine actors such as Nancy Walker."
3,"Just a ""little"" disappointed... but not by much!","I spent many Saturday nights throughout the 70's watching Sonny and Cher, the Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show with my family before being sent to bed :o( I am very pleased with this box set, but I only wish the transfers were digitally enhanced (like they were done with Gilligan's Island, McHale's Navy, and F-Troop, for instance). Also, there are no bonuses. No ""Where are they now's"", no bloopers, behind-the-scenes, interviews, or any other goodies for a television program as popular as this was in its day. Still, I am looking forward to the next season already!"
5,Where's Season Five?!,"This is by far the best ensemble cast ever on a television show. I can watch each episode again and again. But...I'm getting a little tired of that. With such a quality show and such and loyal fan base, WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO RELEASE SEASON FIVE?!!"
5,"We Are Waiting For Seasons 5, 6 & 7","Ye, there are those of us Mary fans who would do anything to see her turn our world on with a smile....This Show was the best of the 1970's, and we are waiting for the remaining seasons to appear. So far, we have 1, 2, 3, and 4, so there's only 3 more to go.C'mon Fox......If you don't want to release the remaining Mary Tyler Shows, let someone else who will do it.matchbox"
5,Optimism for Remaining Seasons,"The Sept 1 review by James (Minnesota) refers to a New York Times article reporting that the remaining three seasons will soon be scheduled for release. The article's very encouraging. It identifies the source of the good news as 20th Century Fox Entertainment's Sidney Feldstein, Senior Vice-President, Corporate & Marketing Communications.The article by Mark Harris appeared in the Times' Aug 2 issue. It can be accessed in its entirety at nytimes.com by entering Mary Tyler Moore Show in that website's search box."
3,More of a reference,"The reader from Columbia, SC, said it right: this book is a reference, not a place to learn J2ME. Like the other books in O'Reilly's ""In a Nutshell"" family, the book has two parts: a quick rundown on the features of J2ME, and a reference part on all the details of the language. The book's audience is someone who already knows something about the J2ME platform, such as how it looks, how it runs on a PC, and how it produces the code you can upload to a device. If you want to see a tutorial type of book on J2ME, you won't find it here. Since I never learned Java completely, I find it difficult to follow the book. If you already know Java well, you may find the book easier to follow, although again you won't find detailed, step-by-step sample programs.In short, probably great for someone already programming in J2ME; not helpful for someone wishing to learn J2ME."
2,for the novice,"The information in the book was meant for the beginner. Half the page is filled with reference to classes & packages which are available free on the web on java.sun.comDont understand the need to be paying for free information.The author seems did not have enough material or information to fill the book. A slightly better book is ""Java on PDAs: Developing Applications for PocketPC and Palm Devices"" by Daryl Wilding-Mcbride."
3,A must see masterpiece that keeps you thinking!!!,"The movie can also be said to be a character sketch. Sanjay Suri, Juhi Chawla, Urmila Matondkar and Jimmy Shergill all play challenging roles. You've never seen them like this. You can identify with all the characters.Music is definitely a double plus! They're still pleasant to hear and add to the situation in the film.Onir's a remarkable director. He chose a bold theme and he chose the best actors (not the biggest stars) which makes this movie worth a watch. Whether you'll like it or not, I'd definitely say watching it would be worth your time."
5,A classic score brilliantly restored!,If you can find a better classic movie score . . . buy it! Hypnotic and dazzling.
5,Preferred over the original,"I love this cd, I always listen to it. My favorite tracks are #2, where the strings remind me of polished glass and #6 where Scottie and Madeline ""wander"" near the giant trees. ""It was just a moment for you, you took no notice"". I also love #8 where I can hear suggestions of the voices that Madeline says she hears."
4,Overview of the Book,"It started out as a quiet day on the farm with all of the animals eating and relaxing until a plumb Hen stumbled upon a large rain puddle and when she glanced into the puddle she saw her reflection and thought a plumb Hen had fallen in the rain puddle and couldn't get out. She was so excited she ran and got help...a Turkey came to her rescue and went to the exact same rain puddle and peered in...what did he see...not a Hen, but a Turkey who was trapped in the puddle. He ran away and got a PIG to help...well when the Pig looked into the puddle what do you think he saw...you got it...then a sheep and a cow and then the rest of the barnyard were looking into the rain puddle all seeing their reflections and thinking there were animals trapped in the puddle and couldn't get out. To their amazement, the puddle dried up and all were rescued. The animals went on their daily business and up in the tree the Wise 'ole Owl had watched the whole event and just chuckled to himself."
4,"great performance, great recording, great disc","I just have to echo the listener below--this is an outstanding live recording, and Missing Persons makes it worth our while with inspired, concise renditions of many of the band's best songs.The previously unreleased ""Action Reaction"" is a gem of a studio track (also sounding great!) that finds the band at the funnest and punkiest that I've heard it. Bassist Patrick O'Hearn and drummer Terry Bozzio are the standouts here, for me at least, and both are enjoying highly (artistically) successful solo careers making music very different from each other and from this!If you're at all a fan of Missing Persons, though, you owe it to yourself to check this out, especially now that it's available domestically for far less than I paid for my Japanese version!"
1,Late Shipping and just plain rude,"I purchased two cans of evian spray water that took FOREVER to ship.AFTER I gave them a negative review on Amazon, they called me and lied and saidthey called me to inform me this shipment will be delayed. Which they never did.So then the company called me and requested I remove the negative feedback.I said NO. Then proceed to speak as to the reason and they hung up on me.Seriously how can a company survive times like this with POOR CUSTOMERservice??? There was no free shipping or discount for delay. All I received was rudetreatment. My advise by your Evian facial spray elsewhere."
1,"FRAGILE ""TEETH""","I am highly disappointed in the FRAGILE ""teeth"" that hold this charger into my Sony Ericsson phone. But, I NEED the charger for my mobile lifestyle. I have had to purchase SEVERAL replacements after at least one of the ""teeth"" broke off."
3,neat charger but i dont know... doesnt work anymore,"i've had this charger for about 6 months now. it is great design because it has a cool green sony light on the charging base and an auxillary LED on the charging end. very useful!however, it's broken now. i dont know what happened... maybe the fuse blew. i will have to look into it. i didnt abuse it, but it all of a sudden stopped working."
1,Low Quality Phone Charger,"This product worked fine for about three days, only to all of a sudden stop working. I took it apart to find that one of the two small, fragile wires inside had snapped, and noted that the wires were of very low quality and had a poor soddering job. I barely tugged on the other wire, only to have it snap as well. This product is not recommended by me. The only pro to this product i can think of is that it looks pretty cool, but I would rather have a product that works than a product that looks cool ANY day."
1,Stopped working within 1 week,"Nice idea, especially the ""flashlight"" but it stopped working after 3rd use. Flashlight no longer worked and although light on plug showed power from car, it didn't charge the phone. Also was not easy to plug in to phone."
4,Great CAR Charger!,"This is indeed a great car charger as one of its features, it got a reading lamp attached to the charger & it's very useful inside the car for reading maps, directions, etc."
1,A1 sells scraps....,"I purchased this charger for my W300i, and the first charger they sent to me had a short in it...it wouldn't charge the phone. The sent a replacement to me, very quickly (which I appreciated). However, the replacement was missing the Sony Ericsson emblem on the end of the car charger. Not a big deal, except that it covers up a bright white light. After a month of using the replacement charger, one of the 2 plastic tips that help keep the charger and phone connected broke off. So now I have another car charger that won't work (unless I hold the charger to the phone). I have strong suspicions that A1 purchases leftover products from Sony Ericsson that did not meet Sony's standards."
1,Cheaply made,I bought this charger a few months ago it worked fine for some time and i was pleased but then the cheap plastic on the plug broke so it would not stay connected to the phone. It would be one thing if i dropped it or something happened to it but the plastic part was cheap and broke just as i disconnected it from the phone as i did every day. I am convinced this is a result of the company making these chargers cheaply. Stay away from this product if you can.
4,Great charger with passthrough and light,"Excellent design overall. Using with a W810i. I love the passthrough port for connecting up the audio port while charging at the same time in my car. And the switchable light on the connector (see the grey slider switch) is a great addition.Would have rated 5 stars, but the clip on the back of the connector broke on the second day. They need to redo this. Not sure what's it really needed for anyway. I plan to always have this plugged into my phone cradle(Sony HCH-70) when it arrives."
3,Charger,It looks great but one of the prongs gets stuck in the phone and I have to pry it out every time (kinda cheap) and the plastic clip on the back broke right after I took it out of the package. but over all a good looking product. Just have some super glue on hand when you try it out the first time :)
4,Worth the money....,"This product is cool and worth the money. It has an additional light which you can use for searching in your car. Plugging it to your phone might be a little difficult while driving, but it charges your phone fast.The first one I got did not work. I appreciate SF Planet for sending me a replacement with a prepaid shipping label. It arrived pretty quick. Otherwise it would have ruined my roadtrip for the long weekend.I'ld definitely recommend buying from SF Planet."
2,sony car charger for the w810i,the plastic prongs on the charger pull out of the charger and stay in the phone. very cheap!!!
1,Unreliable,"This charger does not have the same adaptor head as the AC charger that come with the cell phone. So it does not have a ""click"" feeling when plugging into the cell phone. Because of that it get loss sometime during driving. It still ok. The worst part was that after just 2 months this charger would not charge my cell phone anymore. Who said Sony product is reliable! This is not the 1st time Sony fail unreasonable in my experience."
1,Worked for about a month,"Nice features, looked good. But... it stopped charging after a month. It never seemed to make a solid connection with the phone. The plastic tabs that hold it in didn't break on my charger, but they seemed to be a very weak link. Also, perhaps the contacts were not long enough to keep contact with the phone. The slightest jiggling had the charging constantly starting and stopping.This is the second (the first was a different brand)that had similar problems. And, unfortunately, as much as I like the Sony Ericsson phones, I probably will not get another if it has the same type of plug in. I think it makes it difficult to have a totally reliable mobile charger."
2,"great design, weak plastic","The LED map light and clean design were enough to get me to order two, but both broke within a few weeks. The plastic used for the connector is brittle, and the tabs that insert into the phone break off after a few dozen uses. Some have reported that this leaves pieces of plastic in the phone, which you have to fish out with a needle. Another cool-looking piece of failed tech headed for the trashcan."
5,Worked liked a charm,"Ordered to upgrade my brother's laptop -- went in no prob, he's happy as a clam!"
1,This seller is a cheater,"I ordered few item, later they cancelled it and raise the price.so if you order anything beware, you will be cancelled later.waste of time."
4,Works fine,"The memory works fine but be very careful installing it. I decided to do it myself on my laptop after reading the installation instructions online. Well, as I was explained later, I didn't plug it in firmly enough before turning the laptop back on. It caused destruction of my mother board. So I had to pay $250 to replace the mother board for $450 laptop. Very expensive experience for me. It's better to pay $20 at any computer repair store so that they do the installation properly."
3,"Ok, I guess.","It was easy to install. My computer shows that I have the extra memory, however I don't notice a significant difference (some) in the speed of boot up or in how long it takes to open programs. But I'm no techie so I don't really know exactly what it's supposed to do, honestly!"
1,Bad rate not for the product,"I already rated this negatively because the Fed Ex couldn't find proper address which, I still couldn't believe, and seller made no efforts to contact Amazon, probably, to find out the proper and the only shipment address. So, really no need to rate it twice. Hope next time will be better. My guess is it was not Amamzon's mistake at all.Regards.Mario Sebetovsky"
5,Good price,Nice tape. No complaints from my staff. Does it's job. Will buy again from the vendor. Came very fast in the mail.
2,Nothing invisible about it,"This tape is ""matte finish"" NOT CLEAR. It looks white. Slightly transparent but most definitely not invisible. So it'll do for crafts, but looks cheap for gift wrapping, etc."
2,Not what it says,"The packaging says invisible tape, but it sure is not invisible it has a mat finish but not clear. I have had clear tape in the past that you could hardly see that it was not a book or something. And another complaint that I have is that it does not stick very well for holding torn books. We bought it at Walmart 3+1 Bonus and it was cheep, you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this tape to any one or buy it again. I know that regular duck tape is very sticky but they need to improve the design of this tape. For I while i gave it to my 4 year old daughter so she could use it for her play package raping. But then we got down to one roll so I though I better put it up for now until we get more."
1,not invisible,"This tape was called ""invisible,"" but it is not. I purchased for a photo project that needed completely invisible tape. I had to go to the store and purchase other tape instead."
2,Arrgh!,Never will we be fooled again! We do a lot of mailings in our business and tried the henkel due to its price. Not invisible but actually that wasn't the issue... it is CHEAP! It doesn't tear off the roll easily and it is not nearly as sticky as Scotch. In the future we'll get the Scotch and pay a little more to get a better tape.
1,Buy SCOTCH brand instead!,"I purchased this tape thinking because it was Duck brand that it would be awesome. I was so very wrong. Now I have 3 rolls of tape that does anything but stick. If you are looking for a product that doesn't work, make sure you purchase this product!"
1,Assembly of quotes stretched to conform to Keith's view.,"Keith's book is mostly an assembly of quotes from other books. It is largely unreadable and Keith makes no assertation that hasn't already been better made elsewhere. Keith is absolutely convinced his assertations are correct, but his arguements are thin. I got the feeling he only exposed himself to sources he would be certain supported his views. Not a ""scholarly"" effort at all. Read the books he quotes, you'll at least get a more complete picture. The book is a waste of money -- there's more reliable information on the web."
1,Incompetent lowdown of fictionalities,"In short summary, this book is an outright disgrace. My apologies to all UFOlogists who came here to find enlightenment, you certainly won't find it here!The author belates the point by making insane references to books nobody has heard of (which are probably just imaginary books from imaginary authors), and makes no attempt to clarify any of the incompetent and outrageous statements he puts forth.If you go for this stuff as entertainment, this book may provide a laugh or two--like a particularly well-crafted X files episode--but if you seek true enlightenment through these pages, you're in for quite a disappointment."
5,Soldering ease,The charcoal works great when I am soldering delicate or fine pieces. I broke it up into two parts so I can use it for smaller metal pieces.
5,Dealers choice,"Tom's best book. Not an easy choice to make,but I think it includes some of what Tom considers his best stuff too."
2,Disappointing,"I've read all the reviews of this book and decided to get a copy. I found it quite dull and the characters two-dimensional. I've read a lot more interesting books than this.Sorry, it didn't do anything for me. Gordon"
5,Fascinating Read,"""Surviving Pieces"" by Dana Matthews is a fascinating read that literally left me spellbound. Matthews weaves a fictional story around an intriguing subject matter involving reincarnation of twin souls. The concept is unique and the most interesting I've read in a good while. Matthews touches upon a horrific time in history in a way that is absolutely enthralling and powerfully delivered. She writes with vast knowledge of her subject, as well as the psychological field, past-life-regression, and law enforcement. Matthews brings a much-needed fresh voice to the literary field and is an author who will prove to be a mainstay. ""Suriviving Pieces"" is a book that reads like a bestseller, and one I highly recommend."
3,Just passable,"I bought this CD after a long absence of material from the Kings of groove. After the first listen, I hadn't noticed any outstanding tracks. But the material grows on you after a couple of listens. ""Keep it real"" has a rare funky groove that seemed to be missing since the days of 'Raise!' and 'Powerlight'. Other than that track, the other notable ones are ""Round and round"", ""Take you to heaven"" and ""The right time"". It seems that the band was trying to revive their old 70's and 80's funk but didn't quite succeed. All in all, I'd say that this is a passable album and nothing like their greatest work so far, 'Raise!'."
5,Great on A Saturday Afternoon,"My 7 year old (and of course mee too) loves all three of these. He'll actually sit still for hours and listen to them, and race to the CD player waiting for me to change discs. It was dissapointong to see these broadcasts get progressivly smaller with each movie. From 7 in the first, to 5 in the second, and the Return only three CD's long. The last is almost nothing but the movie, with very little additional material. It's still good, but after lstening to A New Hope, The Return of The Jedi feels very short. I would highly reccommend these. They're great for those cold or raining Saturday acfternoons."
5,Non-stop Thrilling Science Fiction for the ears,"Now after 20 years of the Star Wars Movie Saga, we are all enlightened with the radio dramas. Allowing us to use our imaginations to extend the visuals of the story."
1,Terrible,"I am a huge audio book fan. I love almost every Star Wars audio put out to date.This ranks as one of 3 out of hundreds of audiobooks I have listened to that I couldn't make it through.The recasting of charecters is so bad as to severly distract from the story. The actors are of great caliber, but in these roles they just do not work.If I pay $100 for something I want it to soar, not crash. Save you money and just listen to the audio from the movies."
3,FAIR,"With consistent vocals ranging from Average White Band to Eric Benet, Toshi Kubota has managed to provide a somewhat refreshing twist to R & B music. Most of the tracks are acceptable and even stand out amidst his contemporary artists. There are subtle attempts to provide a wink to Curtis Mayfield's vocal stylings. The major shortcoming is in the freshness of the approach. Many stateside artists could have pulled this album off without the same fanfare, but the fact remains he is Japanese. The track ""Body Bounce"" is weak at best. The acknowledgment of Roger Troutman and his creativity is the only saving grace. I am sure Mr. Troutman and his fans would have appreciated it more had there been any funky interpolation of ""More Bounce to the Ounce."""
5,Amazing!,"It is amazing! This book should be in the hands of every teenager in this country. - Dr. Robyn Benson, DOM. Founder and Director of Santa Fe Soul Health & Healing Center"
5,Discover Molly Johnson,I had never heard of Molly Johnson until I was watching the dvd of Soul Food the tv show. I had to backtrack several times because I just loved the singer who was performing. I checked the soundtrack from the tv show and her song was not on it. I then checked several stores that I buy used cds from and could not find her cd anywhere. I just found it today at Best Buy and absolutley loved it. I hope to hear more from this artist in the future.
4,Another Day ..Solid,Molly's voice is front and centre on this disc. A great cover of summertime and a woderful duet on ooh child/redemtion song. If you love straight up jazz you will love this disc.
4,Molly Johnson is Wonderful,"Seller sent my Molly Johnson CD very quickly. The price was great, considering that new, these sell for $40 or more. The CD is listed as used in good condition, but it is so much better than that. It may have been opened, but I doubt it was used. I am a little concerned that the CD itself is labeld for promotional use only and not intended for sale or distribution by anyone without consent of the label. That being said, Molly Johnson has a unique sound that is worth having a listen to, especially at this price."
2,I think it's very average for him.,"I started liking Graham Parker back in the 70's when most people in America were into ELO. I had not heard anybody like him, his stuff was contemporary but old fashioned sharp acerbic lyrics that were to the point and cut to the bone and his voice had this white blues whine to it, I loved his stuff. You listen to this album and listen to the early GP albums and the things that he was so famous for are gone. He is a good writer but he uses it in a way less effective way since his songs aren't ""to the point"" like they use to be, it seems like he rambles on and on instead of stopping the song and leaving you wanting for more. Also his acerbic wit is gone which made the songs have a nice sting to them. If you want a great GP record check out: Heat Treatment, Squeezing out the Sparks, Howling Wind to start. This album is only good for hardcore fans and customers that want an average predictable album."
3,Parkers latest,"This is a good, clean recording of unmistakable style. No surprises here, except to say that Parker continues to make pleasurable, if not great, music. The voice is sounding a bit Dylanesque with age. I'm not sure if that means anything - just something that occured to me.If you're a Parker fan, you have to own this record."
3,I don't notice any difference from the Malt I bought at the beer brewing store.,"It's hard to tell if it works or not. There seems to be no difference between the other one (not Diastatic) and the one i got from you. However, i don't blame you for these results."
4,NICE TO ADD TO YOUR COLECTION,"I OWN THIS CD AND MUST SAY IT IS NICE TO ADD TO YOUR MUSIC COLLECTION, TO LISTEN TOO WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH THAT SPECIAL SOME ONE!.OR THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE IS IN LOVE WITH YOU. I THINK GARLAND GREEN MADE A BIG HIT WITH JEALOUS KIND OF FELLA. I REMEMBER THIS SONG WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, AND LOVED IT EVERY SINCE!, AND STILL TILL THIS DAY I LISTEN TO THIS CD!. I FIND IT TO BE A KIND OF CD TO JUST SIT BACK AND LISTEN TO WHEN YOU FEEL THINGS AREN'T GOING RIGHT FOR YOU IN THAT SPECIAL KIND OF RELATIONSHIP! .SO IF THERE ARE ANY GARLAND GREEN FANS OUT THERE AND LIKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC, THIS IS THE CD TO GO FOR!.I THINK IT'S ONE TO HAVE!"
5,One of the best books on parenting,"I teach Parent-Child classes with children aged 1.5 to 3.5 years and their parents. I have been using this book for over 10 years with the parents in the class, and I have not found a book I like better to recommend to parents. The book emphasizes natural/holistic parenting methods, and offers excellent guidance to parents on rhythm, play, health, discipline, and many other topics."
2,Nothing new to me,"I haven't read a ton of books on child development. I have a nine month old. I check Dr. Sears' Baby Book every once in a while. Surprisingly, I felt like this book had very little to teach me. Most of it I had heard before or seemed like it was just common sense. The references at the end of each chapter seemed slightly out of date and far from comprehensive. I only read the beginning as my child is not yet a toddler. Maybe it gets better. But for babies it felt like a waste of money."
1,save your money,camera did not work with our computer. It did not have a display screen which I thought it had when I read the advertisment.it only takes 16 pictures. not a good buy. The company refunded my money promptly.
1,Don't order even if free,"A waste of $20. The picture quality is bad, the camera featureless, the storage so small it can only be used as a webcam. And the worst part is the software that the argus makes you install to get your pictures off--clearly designed by drunk sadists. Unless you enjoy misery, avoid this camera no matter how cheap."
1,Dissapointing,"I purchased this because I was hoping to save money from constantly buying disposable cameras. Unfortunately, this camera isn't compatible with my computer, and the entire interface is somewhat confusing."
2,Argus LLC 1088 camera,"This camera has no view screen, so its just like having a 35mm camera. It is not a good purchase for a beginner digital photographer and or a child, spend some more money and get a better camera."
1,A Remake of an Earlier Product,"Don't bother with this tape. I really enjoyed Naparstek's previous tape, Healthful Sleep, Guided Imagery. Having listened to that tape at night for years, imagine my surprise when I order ""another"" of her tapes to find this is just a remake of the earlier tape. (A way to sell more, just repackage but put the same thing inside!) But it's worse than just a remake. The tape is minimally changed, but all changes are for the worse. Her voice and intonation on this new tape are not nearly as good or soothing as the previous tape. She has also changed phrases here and there; just enough to jar someone who has listened so much to the original tapes. The background music is also not as soothing as the original. WHY REMAKE and then remake less well? (It's like getting a new CD by a favorite artist, but find the ""new"" CD is full of all old songs, sung not as well as the original, with just a few new words and inferior backgound music. Disappointing!)"
2,sadly this gives Guided Imagery a Bad name!,"After reading Bellaruth's book and experiencing several guided imagery sessions with a skilled practitioner I was very excited about getting this CD. I was terribly disappointed. Her voice sounds flat and expressionless and rather creepy. The pacing is a little fast for relaxation and she sounds robotic and lacking warmth. Even if I want to recommend this CD because I believe Imagery can be a powerful tool for personal growth, I can't."
1,Pickle Boy Does it Again,Mt. Olive has topped itslef with this pickle actually it hasn't. BUY VLASIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
3,"Not bad, but not that good either...","The first pages promise a good book, unfortunately, they fail to deliver. Sophy never seems 'right' somehow, alternating between strong willed and yielding.. Her character has promise that is never really fully developed in the book.The hero, Ives wants revenge, then he forgets about revenge and decides he wants Sophy, then he wants revenge again, then he wants the spy..?? It seems that the author never really managed to get it all together. There are a lot of loose ends throughout the book and too many questions left unanswered..Overall, I found the plot too thin and too unbelievable. The bit about the spy was obviously forced to add an 'interesting dimension' and had the writer managed to tie all the pieces together, the story would have been excellent..I did manage to finish the book since it did have its moments and it does get better towards the end, so it's not a total write-off."
3,Comparison with other books by Shirlee Busbee,If you have never read a Shirlee Busbee book then you don't know what your missing. She always has some kind of suspense and mystery along with the great romance that she writes. The first book I ever read by her was Lady Vixen (which I consider to be an awsome book) so I compare all of her other books to this one. This book has all the fine makings of a great book but kind of falls flat with the historical part. The suspense and mystery are there and this is one of the reasons this book is a page turner. You don't know who the spy is until the end.
4,For Love Alone,"Sophy Marlowe was widowed when her husband died in a suspicious fall down the stairs of his home. Ives Harrington lost his family in an accident that may not have been accidental. Both tragedies are connected... but it is not until they meet and a new series of murders occur that the truth may be discovered. Ives needs to marry and produce an heir, now that he is the last Harrington. When her uncle is murdered, and she is implicated in his murder, Ives marries her. This novel continues the Shirlee Busbee string of excellence. Intrigue, sensuality, and vibrant characterization make this 4 1/2 star read a keeper!"
3,Hard to get through,"Well, I must agree with other reviews- I too don't like to put a book down and I did get through this one. But it was a struggle. I found my head nodding many a time and I did a lot of skimming of paragraphs and pages. The first of the book was promising but then about 1/3 of the way through things got somewhat slow and somewhat unbelievable. I liked Sophy but found her putting herself in unbelievable situations for her personality- Ives was my kind of man, but his devotion for revenge sure changed quickly after meeting Sophy. This was my first SB book and right now I'm not interested in reading another of hers, maybe a little later on I'll give one a try. But I am hesitant right now..."
2,Not really a good beyblade,"Jumping Base really isn't that good. If you know how to build it it is okay, but the screws on the bottom are hard to put on, and if you flip the little plastic part over the bottom you can put the screws in but have no room to put the spring. Even if you cant put the spring on it's a pretty good blade. My friends and I were playing Beyblades at school and Jumping Base (without the spring on) smashed my other friend's combination Beyblade and hit it so hard that it hit my ither friend's stomach. If you can't figure how to get it together if you get it and you want the spring on, either deal with it or take it back. I hope this review was helpful and remember: LET IT RIP!"
4,Driger Jumping Base Review,"I have been blading for about three years and have over fourteen beyblades including Jumping Base. It is a very good beyblade because it has three different tips to put on the bottom of the beyblade to increase Attack, Endurence, and speed and, because it has a spring to bounce it is higher than most beyblades so it it is invulnerable to most attacks. the only thing I didn't like about the beyblade is that if you launch it to high it has a tendency of bouncing out of the stadium."
5,Enjoy this,"It is so delicious to listen to surprisingly clever original music. The words, the vocalists, the music are fantastic. I just wish I could see the original musicals performed with these musicians. Lots of things surprised and delighted me when I was a child 60 some years ago. Everything was so fresh and new then. This music gives me that feeling again."
2,"Too repetitive. Overrated,...","I agree with other people here. His solos are way too repetitive and boring. I just can't understand how the other musicians can play so many times the same extremely easy phrase so Poncho gets to do his solos,... which, by the way, are not that great.I also don't see the point in their singing. First of all neither him nor the other singers really knows how to sing, but worse, the lyrics are really poor, extremely predictive and base.Overall, I think he has been overestimated by the media."
3,Not that bad...,"While I agree with Darío Zapata's review that Poncho's neither the most varied nor the most inspired Latin Jazz percusionist, Latin Soul is likely to be his best recent album. The Groove is here and although the style is a bit repetitive it's good fun. Anyway, it'd be tough to make classics such as Cold Duck Time boring as the rain.Give it a try."
5,Hotest Fiction This Century!,The best novel I've read since Grisham came along! Can't wait to see the movie!
5,Hot Summer Read!!!,"If you are looking for a book to take to the beach this summer, this is it! This new author has it all: intriguing characters and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your beach chair. I could not put Tormented down. We've been passing it around the beach house since Memorial Day and can't stop talking about it. You go girl!!!"
5,"If you like sizzlin' baby, Tormented is your ticket!","Passion, betrayal, ah lives of the rich and shameless. A great book. Totally entertaining and gets your heart pumping. Don't read if you have a heart condition. You'll need a transplant quick."
5,Superb In Every Way,"From Wall Street to the South of France... love, romance, torment, high level business dealings, mystery, intrigue, suspense... Tormented Without A Trace has it all. We'll all be seeing more from this young, talented, new author!"
1,A [bad] Vanity Trip,"A friend recommended this book for its amusement value. She was correct. The book was both comical and [bad] in its vain attempt to be serious. The characters' dialogue was insipid, stilted, and contrived. The author's penchant for trying to impress fails miserably and is all the more transparent. In addition, as someone who works in the industry, the author portrays a overwrought and completely unrealistic image of how Wall Street works, including basic factual errors. Evidently, the closest the author has come to working in investment banking is putting together pitch books in the copy room.Readers are invited to visit out the author's web site (check out the Elvira wanna-be look). There is supposedly a forthcoming movie based on the book. Who is this C-level director? The only people who will see this movie are those plugging quarters into a booth in Times Square."
1,Who's Tormenting Whom?,I found this book to be quite laughable. The dialogue is inane and unrealistic. Some of the geography of New York is incorrect and the basic facts of Wall Street are wrong. The non-stop parade of brand names and places was quite irritating. The book comes across as a desperate attempt to get attention.
4,HOT! HOT! HOT!,The book slams you right between the eyes from the beginning and your are hooked. Each chapter ends with a bang. And you have no idea what's going to happen next. I read there's a sequel. I'll be the first in line when it comes out.
2,Boring,"I'm trying and will continue to try. I've re-read the other reviews and they keep me thinking that this book will at some time get more interesting.This book is for a class titled, ""The History of Cleopatra."" If you are looking for a well researched book that spits fact after fact about everything except Cleopatra then this is for you. I am on page 65 and I'm wondering when the book is going to start revolving around Cleopatra's life, instead of her father, her father's father, this city, that city, this man, that man.I love to read and was looking for something more entertaining - Anne Weir is a historical novelist she at least makes her written word interesting.This is B-O-R-I-N-G.The only reason why I give it two stars is due to the research. If you are looking at regurgitated fact after fact of agriculture, gods, whatever - this is your book."
3,Great when it works.,"I bought one of this product in March 2009 from Amazon.com and gave it to my wife as a gift. she loved it and cooked with it twice each week. It's easy to use and energy efficient. However, in the beginning of June the exterior transportation pot doesn't hold heat anymore. The manufacturer's warranty is only good for 30 days so we have to throw it out, unless l'm willing to spend more to send it back to their shop and pay for repairment.In all, it's a great product if it could work longer."
4,the music is great...,"the music really fits into the movie. I liked most of the songs, except for #9, where the end Car Chase Scene suddenly had vocals, a slightly different beat, and it didn't have the turntable scratching effects. I would definately give the soundtrack a 5-star if they had the original instrumental car chase scene music in the CD. Otherwise, it is still a great CD and highly recommend buying it, especially if you already seen the movie."
2,Book:ok Author: NOT,"The popularity of this cookbook should be credited to hype and only that. Hype brought on by the staged exposure the author has created for himself on TV and book signings. (Does he ever spend time in the kitchen??) Unfortunately, I bought the book before seeing the TV reality series on his restaurant. The book's interesting but I didn't learn anything new. The only thing I did learn was from the TV show. So, I ask myself, why would I, or anyone else, want to put a penny in the pocket of such a arrogant prima donna such as Rocco? The are far better and finer Italian cook books on the shelves for anyone from a novice to advanced and I recommend that anyone looking skip anything with Rocco's name on it. Anything by Mario Batali comes to mind.The only reason I can figure why anyone would want to buy this book is to have Rocco's name on their shelf. Dumb reason!"
2,Save your money,"This is a beautiful picture book, but a waste as a cookbook. Lobster salad, glazed duck??? Not the way we eat in Tucson Arizona. A much better purchase is ANYTHING from Donna Hay. Beautiful and do-able recipes with all the panache you need."
2,More of a coffee table book than a legitimate cookbook,"""Flavor"" by Rocco DiSpirito is a cookbook based around the four basic flavors (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty), and how to combine these flavors with different types of food to create some incredible dishes. This book is loaded with full color glossy photos of some incredible looking dishes. All of the recipes have exotic names and look like something you'd find at the best restaurants in New York. 'Flavor' would look great on any bookshelf or coffee table, however it is not very practical as a cookbook. The information in it is a very overwhelming and not something the average person is going to be able to make. The recipes are difficult, and call for a LOT of ingredients that you will have to look up and go out of the way to find. It also has a wierd color ""flavor index"" that is very confusing."
3,NOT and Italian cookbook!,"I don't have any idea why I expected this to be an Italian cookbook. The book is beautiful to say the least, but has only three pasta recipes. I, unfortunately, live in Kansas and am unable to purchase the beautiful fresh fish that so many of these recipes require. I am also not able to purchase, at least locally, many of the exotic ingredients Rocco uses. It wasn't what I expected, but it might be your cup of tea"
3,Great For Inspiration....,"I am a professional Chef with a soft spot for cookbooks. Sometimes I follow the recipes sometimes I don't. Mainly, I like to look at the pictures for ideas and inspiration. My frustration with most cookbooks is there are too many words and not enough pictures. cooking is a sensual/visual experience and less science. If you want science then start baking! But with cooking there aren't too many linear paths to the end, rather many routes to the same place. So if you are a chef and like to see new ideas then at least check this book out. There are a lot of good flavor ideas. If your are a home cook looking for a trusted recipe then stay away. You will have a hard time with recipes in this book. They obviously weren't tested and will be frustrating for you."
5,I'am now a transformed man,This is the greatest album ever! and I mean it. I have nominated this album for 'best album of the millenium'. I hope Mr Shatner never gets a life.
3,3 stars for being hilarious; 0 for musical talent,"Borrowing a term Maddox once used, this album is an aural holocaust. The reason to buy this is to laugh at how terrible it is. While other more musically talented men avoided the problems of turning such classic rock songs as ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" into spoken word, Shatner attacked them...and then failed miserably. Surprisingly his music is possibly even more overdramatized than his acting and has unnatural melody-killing pauses for effect embedded throughout each song. It prevents casual listening or just enjoyable listening other than for comedic purposes."
2,What compelled him to record this?,"I hate to mock this CD, and the truth is, it is quite addicting, but in a negative way. ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" is classic, with the screaming Shatner bellowing ""Mr. Tambourine Maaaaaaaaaaaaan!"" at the end of the song. Sinatra fans will love ""It was a Very Good Year"", even though it wasn't ""a very good rendition"". And finally, the Beatlemaniacs will get high simply listening to the vibrating echoes of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds""! This is a must have, or a must gift, for any Star Trek fan."
1,Transformed?,"The absolute worst (and funniest) cover of a Beatles song is Shatner's ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"". Listening to the selections on this album, I can only conclude that there is more ham in a single Shatner performance than there is in the whole state of Virginia."
1,Plastic performance era.,"Taken objectively, this performance speaks of the pure superficial realm created in thepost war era. Persona, cancels reason.At least Shatner stands up to reveal the miasma of filth, save it can no longer beobscured. Anyone who dares listen to this album will be Transformed.Be brave, the contrails of vomit must be cleaned by patient souls.Bill, a debt is owed to you."
2,Perfectly Dreadful,"If celebrated film director Ed Wood (Plan 9 From Outer Space) made an album, it would sound like this. The Transformed Man by William Shatner isn't flawed or ill-conceived, it's perfectly dreadful, reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock. Each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears. This smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of Shatner's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project's breathtaking stupidity. If the phrase, ""So bad it's good,"" is in your lexicon, The Transformed Man just might be your guy. (Warning: Do Not Operate Heavy Equipment While Listening To This CD.)"
2,"Amazingly bad, but you really do need to have it","How often can one have the absolute worst of anything? Seriously, I really don't think anything worse has ever been recorded in the history of mankind. I plan on burning copies and giving them away as gifts for years to come. The ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" has to be heard to be believed."
4,"Transformer, Man","Performance art, pure and simple, as William Shatner juxtaposes poetry with pop lyrics in this 1968 release.Shatner's wry sense of humor is concealed in his presentation; spoken word with dramatic pauses, which punctuates with an exclamation point - or three - his theatre of the absurd. A parody on the pop culture of the day, it transforms ""The Captain"" into a vocalist with wit and a laugh.....seemingly a bad combination for someone who is supposed to be cruising the galaxy with a Vulcan, Scotty and Bones."
1,The only thing worse would be a Captain Janeway recording.,"Actor, author, pitch-man and now singer(?), Shatner is the rennaissance man of mediocrity. There are only two explanations as to why William Shatner would subjugate humanity to this horror:Probable Explanation: Shatner's greed is the only thing that exceeds his massive ego and he got paid for this excursion into insanity.Trekkie Explanation: After the U.S.S. Enterprise-D encountered the Ferengi, section 31 decided to construct a doomsday weapon against them. An agent was sent back in time to abduct Captain Kirk and, using Romulan technology, forced Kirk to make this album. In the event of war, this recording would be broadcast on all Ferengi communication channels and, with their hyper-sensitive hearing, the Ferengi would be vanquished within minutes."
3,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!,"Ok, let's get this straight! Musically/theatrically, it gets a 0/5. Comically, it's PERFECT!!! I mean, this makes me laugh so hard I cry. You can't take this seriously. He ACTS out SONGS!!! It's like intepretative dancing, but vocally, and really REALLY BAD!!!! This really should be under comedy."
2,A Vocal Stylist at Work,"When William Shatner interprets a classic song, it's eternally his! Littered amid the spoken-word recitals in ""The Transformed Man"" are mind-blowing versions of ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" ""It Was a Very Good Year"" and ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds."" If you're looking for unintentional laughter, you've come to the right place."
3,Cinematography is stylish,Cinematography is stylish..........Aftab Shivdasani - He shreds the cute-dimple-boy-next-door look for the role and handles his character extremely well. This is one powerful performance. Its high time he works with bigger film-makers who can do justice to his talent.The biggest positive of Red is its run time which thankfully is just about 1 hour and 45 mins. Also Aftab Shivdhasani carries the movie on his shoulders.
2,The questions were written by monkeys on computers or more likely computers without monkeys,"I was biking across Third Avenue on 49th street in Manhattan when I spotted Ken Jennings on the North-West corner of the street. I recognized him immistakeably and was inclined to yell ""Ken!"" at him as I raced by. At first he didn't turn but when I was fifteen feet past him he turned and looked and gave me a sort of sheepish look, like ""yes, it's me alright."" It'll go down as one of my favorite celebrity sightings even though I recently lost all respect for him when I played this new board game called ""Can You Beat Ken?"" not licenced by Jeopardy. It plays roughly like Trivial Persuit but the questions are so poorly written it seems like the question writers just copied a bunch of text off Wikipedia and added some question marks here and there. Luckily it came with some miniature Ken Jennings-shaped playing pieces which I promptly desecrated with a permenant marker when the game became too frustrating to play."
5,kick ass,matt groening shows he is more than a one-trick pony with the release of this and the other life in hell books. Many of these cartoons were written before the simpsons began running and show early flashes of the great cynical humor that flows through every episode.
5,Extremely satisfied,"After purchasing and returning a highly-rated Perfex pepper mill (it was almost impossible to turn), I bought this Peugeot and have been completely satisfied with it. It is easy to fill, it holds quite a lot of pepper, and grinds perfectly. The stainless steel base moves to adjust the fineess of the grind, and works exactly as it is meant to work. Grinding is easy and I prefer turning the large stainless steel top to turning a skinny metal handle as on some other mills. It looks great on the table and is large enough to use easily while cooking. I use this every day and it's a great combination of form and function."
1,"Great idea, terrible mechanics",The little stainless steel ball on top constantly comes loose. This thing drove us nuts. We returned it for the Peugeot U-Select Chateauneuf Black Matte Pepper and it works much better (it also grinds better)
2,not karaoke,It was not KARAOKE at all! Just a regular CD.It was not KARAOKE at all! Just a regular CD.It was not KARAOKE at all! Just a regular CD.
4,Citronella Shampoo,Thhis product performed as I expected. In addtion to making the coat soft it also helped with the mosquito and fly problem.
2,LA listener,"Dmitri may have a following, but I found this album to be kind of humorous dollhouse music a la Paris, was a little disappointed, expected more of a funk/dance beat throughout. Very different from Cafe del Mar, Buddha Bar. However, did like Track 11, Stylish Fille. The music is funny in a very 50's movie kind of way!"
2,Dissapointing soundtrack...,"I bought this soundtrack based on the reviews on this site and because I love Hans Zimmer,but I was dissapointed.The soundtrack is only 37 minuets long(2 and a half of it is a dumb rap song..)and it lacks the power of Zimmer's other scores.The much hyped track 7 has only 30 powerful seconds in it and all the rest of the CD is annoyng with too much guitar strings involved...If you want the best Zimmer score out there buy ""The Peacemaker"" which is in my opinion the most powerful soundtrack ever made,You can also buy the excellent ""Crimson Tide"",""The Rock"" and ""Gladiator""."
3,Mixed feelings,"There is a lot of information in this book, and I mean a lot. That's a good thing right? Yes and no. For being such a large, reference oriented book, this has one of the worst indexes I have ever seen. Its terrible. They obviously spent a great deal of time on the book, and its mind-boggling that they wouldn't put a good index in. As such, this is pretty much worthless for quick references. So we are left with a HUGE book, probably suitable only for perio residents, since they are probably the only ones with the motivation, obssesiveness, and lack of sanity to plow through this. Add a good index, and I'd give it five stars."
4,Worked for me,"I've done all the cassettes and CD program in the car, but those can only take you so far. When in China, I've always failed to make it to conversation level. At the very least, there are some terms that seem to be stumbling blocks. That's when I whipped out this pocket electronic gizmo. Worked well, however its not intuitive in its design. One really should sit down and try to read the manual before using it in a real life setting.Ideally, you really need to study Chinese in an academic setting along with this product. That's when you can really leverage its variations for a particular word. The voice sounds are realistic and not computer-sounding.In short, this a useful tool, but certainly not the savior to your language barrier."
3,User instructions could have been written in a clearer manner,"I have been very busy these weeks with writing assignments. After making several futile attempts to understand the instructions, I put the gadget and the instructions on a shelf, where they will likely stay for an extended period.Eventually I hope to be able to dedicate more time to understanding how the machine works and how it may help me to improve my Chinese language skills."
2,Disappointing,"I liked it at first. But, it's already started tearing at the point where the clip is attached to the pouch. The reason I'm not giving it 1 star is because I'm not sure if I was rough with it."
3,Razr Case - Beware of S&H,"I've used a few different designs, and by far this one is my favorite. Most of the other ones I used where either bulkier, or did not have a flap that sealed the top of the case, therefore the phone would still fall out.I do recommend this design, if you plan to wear it on your belt or leave it in your purse. If you like to carry it else where (car, pocket) the button that attaches to the clip for your belt, you'll most likely find cumbersome.I also recommend you buy three at a time, reason, the belt clip tears the leather rather easily (getting in/out of car) There cheap enough, but be careful, there are sellers that still charge you separate S&H; on each order, despite the fact they send them together. I paid $14.85 for shipping, even though they combined my 3 into one package and USPS only charged them $2.85 to ship. I doubt packaging and handling was another $12, that is how they can offer them for $3 each."
4,it's ok,"For the price of this item it's ok. One thing i dont like though is that it sticks out too far when you hang it on your belt or pocket so it bangs on anything you get close to. so it would be nice if the clip was flatter.The reason i bought a case for my razr was because i kept dropping it, but once i got this case i realized i had not made such a good choise because the four corners of this one are cut out so everytime i drop the phone, the edges still get messed up (but that's my fault for choosing the wrong TYPE of case).But overall this is a good product but i bought the wrong one for my needs."
2,bad workmanship,the holder was made very cheaply and fell apart with a couple days of having it. would not reccomend it to anyone.
3,perfectly good,"Nice clean lines, simple, not elegant but just what I wanted. Just a holster, not something that stays on the phone while you use it. You can't charge it with case on, though you can of course use bluetooth. Removable clip is strong but bulky, and the clip on the leather case makes it a bit thick. But it covers and protects every bit of your phone for pockets,purse or glove compartment."
3,"ok, but HUGE clip",the only thing I dont't like is that the pouch itself is almost three times the thickness of the phone...
2,motorola pouch,I do not like the swivel clip that comes on the phonecase.I would have really loved the case if it had a regular beltclip.
5,Motorola V3 Razr Swivel Leather Pouch,"I love this case, it has kept my phone really well protected. I searched many different stores for a case before I found this one."
2,Could have been better...,"This case unfortunately covers your usb port so you can forget about charging and/or using a corded earpiece while it's in the pouch. The case ridiculously protrudes from the rotating clip attachment making it very possible for you to snag, pop, and tear your phone right off of your belt. If you purchase this piece, make sure you place the phone in the pouch with the camera lens towards you as the button inside of the pouch will scratch the lens.Since this is an original Motorola product for a phone that they make, I was expecting a functional and practical case.No dice. :("
2,Functional... for a few weeks.,"Nice product if it was more durable. The extension of the phone off the clip made it vulnerable to snagging and breaking. Unfortunately, this is exactly what occurred when I got into my car the other day. The phone got snagged by the seatbelt, and it broke off falling onto the pavement. No damage incurred to the phone, but I was left with a broken case. Poor foresight by Motorola."
2,"Okay, but there are much better cases","The biggest complaint about this case, is that with the swivel system, the pouch stuck out way too far. It snagged on everything. This was the eventual reason for its breaking.Word of warning to people if they buy this case. When placing the phone inside, place the front end of the phone (cam side) towards you. Otherwise the button snap will crack your camera window if you bump it even lightly."
1,Not For V3xx,"Took the chance and ordered this for my v3xx. It was too small; too tight and the snap was to short to close over the top. Leather stitching inside was shoddy. Also, the back side of the snap from the inside of the case was not covered with the soft cloth, so sliding this phone in and out would definitely make huge scratches on the phone. I could not imagine Motorola being this careless. I question whether this is OEM as stated. Went into the garbage within 10 minutes of opening the package. Due to low cost, I didn't want to get involved with making a return...got burned!"
3,Swivel Broke Off Case,"Nice leather case. Snap closure, not magnetic. However, when I exited my car and case gets stuck on seat belt, the swivel part from the case broke off. It is just a piece a plastic glued to a cardboard backing, inserted into the leather pouch."
3,goog,"the overall product was alright I wish it was a little bit wider, my cell phone is a little difficult to remove from it"
2,Not exactly what I expected,The clip on this case is ridiculious. It is not very well designed and is to bulky to wear on a belt. It is at best OK.
1,Why the big fat clip.,"Why can't they get it right. They design a sweet, sleek black leather sheath for the sleek Motorola Razr V3 series, then they stick this big fat plastic gizmo they call a belt clip. Sometime in our distant past, someone decided Celluar Phone Holders should swivel -- that, of course, was when Cell Phones were the size of small bricks, and weighed as much. Well, times have changed, and so have Cell Phones -- wake up already, a small safety belt clip is all that's needed, and it doesn't have to swivel."
5,Good Study Guide,"Our adult Sunday School program uses this lesson commentary. It is a user-friendly, thought provoking study guide.Note: Price is lower than buying directly from the publisher, and shipping is very fast!"
3,Tracks our Sunday School Lessons,"I buy these books/commentaries so that I can keep track of our Sunday School lessons for the year as opposed to receiving several books throughout the year. I do not find the commentary here very thorough at all. Just a skim of the surface but like I said, they allow me to know what the lesson will be for an entire year. I get reference material from other commentaries to use during Sunday School."
3,A Cute Litte Romance,"I really liked this story. It was a cute little read that is great on an inclement day. I curled up with this book and a cup of coffee and had a good time. Although the storyline is a little hookier that Emma Darcy usually does, it does work, and I think the characters are very honest if a little bogged down with analyzing their situation. Barbie is one half of a new business that puts a new spin on singing telegrams. Unfortunately her newest client is man who, when she was younger, broke her heart, and now he doesn't even recognize her!! She plots her revenge, but gets tripped up when she acknowledges that she is really still in love with him. All ends well when our heroine and the reader finds out that the hero always liked Barbie, he just stepped out of the way because his younger brother liked her and he felt he was too old for her. His whole family help him to get Barbie to understand that he loves her now, and it is a very nice ending."
1,Dreadful!,"Harlequin boks having been going downhill for some time, and you only have to try and read this abysmally bad book to see why! The heroine is called 'Barbie' and prances around dressed up like a ""Barbie Doll"" fairy, wings and all, and carrying a magic wand with which she sprinkles fairy dust on all and sundry. Plus the hero, of course. Mercifully, the book is only 40,000 words long (which would seem to be cheating readers, who normally expect a Harlequin book to be at least a decent 50 - 55,000 words) and finally ends in a hilariously-awful episode whereby Barbie (dressed up in her fairy costume) skips down a large staircase singing ""Over the Rainbow"" to the poor fool of a hero, who tells her that he thinks she sings better than Judy Garland! YUK!"
1,Not recommended,This book has no real value if you are looking to learn about underwriting. It is poorly written and bound. The information in the book is basic and my guess is it was pieced together to make a quick buck. Not recommended.
3,Unable to resist the temptation to be condescending.,"The concept for this book was certainly novel. Nobody can say, either, that Ferguson does not know what he is talking about. The book is detailed and the information relevent. However, after the first few pages I almost ditched it because of what I call, ""Big and towering Blonde-headed Gringo Syndrome."" That is, to adopt this very pathetically aloof manner common amongst travel writers whereby everything is of interest because it is, essentially, ""different"" but, at the same time, the writer never once forgets that he is, after all, amongst an inferior culture of weirdos. I think PJ O'Rourke does that substantialy better -- and he doesn't try and make out to be doing anything any different."
1,Pitiful,"I don't know what book everyone else is reading, but I thought this one wasn't even good to use as scrap paper. The writer can't write and he doesn't have any good insights into Japan. Avoid this like the plague."
3,WOW,"One wonders how such an astounding trainwreck could seemingly be so earnestly intended. It is impossible to do justice to how exceedingly, wretchedly cheesy this is. Others have hit the high (actually low) points, but I don't think there's any way to fully capture the essence of this disc. Kitschy, loungey, retro, irretrievably dated, utterly stunning... At times sidesplittingly funny, at other points unbearably wretched. Like a trainwreck you just can't turn away, though you know you should."
4,Highly entertaining.,"While not as energetic as William Shatner's ""The Transformed Man"", this CD is just as entertaining and does not take itself so seriously. This is a must have for any fan of Star Trek or 60's-esque music. The tunes and lyrics are very catchy and Mr. Nimoy proves he has very good voice control on songs like ""Where is Love?"" and ""You Are Not Alone"" both of which are excellent songs. This CD proved to be much better than I had originally anticipated."
3,Ha! Ha ha ha ha!,"I have this on record, and it only has like the first 11 tracks. I don't know about the rest of them, but the first 11 are really funny. The theme and then the music to watch space girls by are so dated I love them. My band plays them at gigs and people love it. It's like some kind of Trek gogo luau or something(?) Where is Love (from ""Oliver"") is really bad, and some of it is whacked out poetry. Still, if you can get it cheap, do."
2,Truly wretched,"This is one of the few albums that might be able to compete with Bloodrock's album ""D.O.A."" for the worst album ever made, although I think I would give the nod to D.O.A. because the Spock album has at least one redeeming quality - ""Amphibious Assault"", which sounds like one of Robert Heinlein's bad dreams.All kidding aside, the album is worth having as Star Trek memorabilia and as a celebration of why some of us are glad the 1960's are over."
1,Questionable,"Saying I hate it is not true. I did not try it because it has the water saver device in it. I need all the power I can get because my town has no water pressure. I cannot get a satisfactory massage. My first one (and only one for over 20 years) is still in use but has been glued so many times it is not even funny. Keeps on massaging, though!Paperlady"
2,Low flow rate,"I do not recommend this showerhead because the water pressure from the shower head is too low, even after the removing the flow restrictor. You can find directions on the internet for removing the restrictor. I purchased a Niagara Conservation showerhead instead and am much happier with the Niagara Conservation model."
3,Feels great on the neck and back...,"It works very good. I have it for the past 2 yrs. and is still works fine, now after 2 yrs. is that it has a small leak but for the price is ok. So am goanna replace it with the same one. Feels great on the neck and back..."
2,not a bargain,"This shower has no control for water flow (pressure). You can set the patterns for the spray, but you cannot reduce the pressure. The hose is rather stiff and inflexible. It is not very good for a tub/shower with a curtain, but might be better in an enclosed shower. I think I will just re-install the one I removed."
4,Smell coming from newly installled white shower massage handheld,"I installed this quick-to-install waterpik handheld showerhead 3 weeks ago; there is still an offensive smell coming from the unit. What is the cause of this? It was purchased at Target for $20. Help!! I need a solution to this smellproblem as soon as possible, and am hoping the Waterpik company or another user can solve my problem."
1,Hand-held shower,This product cracked where it attaches to the pipe within a week of using it. I should have bought a metal one.
2,No Pressure!,"Very disappointed.!! The water does not come out with enough pressure. I had another brand previously, needed to replace it and have always thought Waterpik had good products but this one sure does `nt work well at all."
5,Shower Head for our Cottage,We've bought several of the Waterpik shower head products for the various places we've lived. So we knew just the item to buy for the shower at our cottage. Price is excellent. Installation is simple. Nice to have the hose to be able to use it to clean the shower & for those times you want to bath & not shower.
2,Disappointing,"Like other reviews.. I will say the same. No power, I even took out the water saver device. Also, it says it has 4 settings.. only 3 of my settings work and when you are using it by hand the settings change with any accidental touch. Very lightweight."
4,shower head,A good shower head but it does not resemble the original ( at least not the one they called original in the early 1980's when I bought my first one.
4,Handheld Waterpick Shower,This product is just fine it does everything that I expectd it to do. Good buy for the price.
3,Not as good as hoped,"When I purchased this I had only heard good things about it. However the fittings seem to be of a cheap plastic and you cannot crank them too tight - problem is, I have ended up using copious amounts of Teflon thread tape and i still can't get the water to stop dripping at the main shower head fitting.Also, the 4 settings are good, but I had really hoped that the pulse settings would have more power on them - I know water pressure is fine in my bathroom so that is not the issue."
2,False Description,"The Chart in the info section describes this item as having 5 MODES--including a ""water Pause"" mode. THis is not true. THere is no pause mode. Buyer beware. If you want that pause mode (as I did) look elsewhere. Plus the showerhead, when attached to the bracket, has a tendency to shift. THe kink in the chord moves it out of place and you wind up with either the spray going against the wall, or the shower curtain. Cheap yes, but if you enjoy your shower buy a better head."
5,Great CD,"The US version of this CD was wonderful, with a track listing that is long, but very listenable. There aren't really any songs that need to be skipped. If you have the US version, and you like/love it, then go ahead and get this one; if you're still needing to get a Velvet Rope, then this one is a great choice- either buyer should be delighted by the extra track."
5,Way cool Album!!!,Janet's music make you want to move your body. Her songs and interludes are the kind that stick in your head all day. Janet clearly pours herself into her music once again. Keep up the good work J.J.
5,Spode Collector,I collect this pattern and was very pleased with the quick delivery and the quality of these dishes.
5,totally jammin',"Absolutely loved this cd! The best r&b gospel I've heard so far. All of the cuts are worth listening to and very danceable (for those of us who like to crank it up and get into some seriously physical praise!) On the down side, the raps were superfluous, neither improving nor adding anything to the songs when they were used, and at some times seeming to have little to do with the rest of the lyrics. And upon occasion Ms. Williams' wonderful voice was drowned out by the backgrounds, which were equally excellent but should not have overrun her vocals. Despite that, I'm delighted to listen to the cd over and over again, and look forward to her next one."
2,At the Core; Behind the Score,"I like the music- the production was impeccable. What bothers me is the voice at the center of this ""whirlwind of creativity"". Ms. Williams oftentimes is loud, and her voice is definitely full, but her presentation lacks inspiration/character. Isn't there a problem when the back up singers sound better than the lead? For this music lover, it's an intollerable imbalance. If you're looking for NoW music with explosive, seamless tracks, lyrics and voices that move you professionaly, you'd do better with other tried artists like Stacie Orrico, Out of Eden, Virtue or Mary, Mary."
3,brings back memories,I had this book as a child and remember it fondly. My older sister would read me my bedtime story. I bought it for my 15 month old son because hes really into reading(well listening to mama read). Just seeing it on his little shelf makes me smile. I dont remember some of the stories being quite so violent however. I know i had this book as a kid and i turned out fine but it might be scary for very small kids. My son is too little to understand the words really but we may just switch to a kids chapter book.
2,It didn't sit well in my mind,"I read the book and it seemed to be way too gruesome for bedtime. If I was a child alot of the stories would have frightened me.For example, there are alot of references to murder, devils, demons, corpses, and other topics which could have a negative affect on young children, especially if they are prone to nightmares.It might be a book for older children."
4,"Good, Clean Reading","A simple, down-to-earth story about a simple, down-to-earth woman. Well told, well written. Highly recommended reading."
4,Good to know,"Positive reinforcement it is something that everibody should know.You can use it for your live stile not only for training mammals.Read this book and test it with your son, husband, wife, collegues and your dog.Thank you to Brenda Aloff the only thing is that you should translate it in Italian.Alessandro"
4,Stylish!,"Unique, but rough around the edges. I had to use trim over the profile areas so scarves would not catch, but still a good value."
5,BRILLIANT,"energetic, INTERESTING, humorous, passionate tunes. Aretha's voice sounds so young and transporting and divine - this album is a treasure. The love songs are sexy and idiosyncratic, the 2 expressly 'spiritual' tunes (of course, all of Aretha is spiritual) are unusual and funny and great and the blues are dead-on... I don't think an Aretha fan could possibly regret getting turned on to this album."
5,An Electronic Companion to Calculus¿,"Dear friends,Apologise bad English. ""An Electronic Companion to Calculus"" is very nice book. It covers matter of calculus first year technical university course. It is written with clear and fluent style, with many good examples. For us it can be used as the excellent textbook of the special English.However, our University Library can buy books abroad only 2002 and later (lack of resources). I intend buy it privately.Best regardsRNDr. Ctibor Henzl, Ph.D.VB - TU Ostrava, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceDepartment of Theoretical Electrical Engineering17. listopadu 15, Ostrava - Poruba, 708 33, CZECH REPUBLIC"
4,PROFOUND,"This is a very good book. I was deeply moved by the information shared in this book. It was very relative and true. The author really disected the purpose of men and identified the areas of difficulty for many, yet provided the solutions found in God's word. Definetely a great book to read over and over again for encouragement."
2,"Suspenseful, but flawed","I agree with Booklover10 about the main character, Anna. I found her passivity not credible. After all, this is supposed to be a highly educated scientist. I simply couldn't believe she could be so out of touch and disinterested in her husband's activities. I also found her decisions late in the book were good for the plot, but did not ring true emotionally. (Can't say more without giving anything away.)"
1,"Skip it, just go for The Hot Zone","It took me forever to finally get into the book and by then, I just wanted all the characters to die from it and the book to be over.... Richard Preston wrote a much better novel, even if he wasn't there."
1,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....,"Agree totally with all the 1-star reviewers. I read the Hot Zone and was riveted. Admittedly The Hot Zone was a bit more sensationalistic, but it was exciting. This supposed true account was dull, dull dull. Much of the book dealt with the interpersonal dynamics of the Sisters, rather than the Ebola outbreak. Based on the book's cover, I was expecting a detailed, somewhat scientific account about how the outbreak was discovered, investigated, and resolved. It certainly didn't do this."
4,Excellent Documentary style Book,"One of the most educational and eye opening books that I have ever read. I love this book and it is the reason i started buying other virus books. It really opened my eyes up to the terror that is truely out in the world that is put there by mother nature. Sometimes difficult to follow, but a facinating subject from a Dr. who was in the thick of the outbreak. Very good book with an objective for everyone to think about viruses like this."
2,E-BORING!,"When I first saw this book, I figured it would be better than the Hot Zone because it dealt entirely with a real outbreak that the author had witnessed. Was I wrong! Preston is clearly a more talented writer and the Hot Zone is a better book. Close nearly put me to sleep talking about everything in the African village except Ebola. The interesting parts covered all of a page or two. At times the book reads likes a soap opera with Ebola as a backdrop. Skip it and stick with Preston and other writers!"
1,Boring boring boring,"You would think this book would have an edge over 'The Hot Zone' since he was actually in Africa during the outbreak, but you would be wrong. It took me forever to finish this book. The disease was much less horrifying in this book than it actually is; it was almost like he was writing about a flu outbreak or something. If you're looking for a real yawner to help you get to sleep at night this might be the book for you."
5,This is the best sample of Rage live short of their video,This collection of live recordings is an excellent example of what has made this band so popular today. The quality of the performances is second to only the viedo which they made of live recordings and un-edited videos.
3,Good CD,"I bought this CD with high expectations but some of it was weak. The new stuff 'Zapata's Blood' and such weren't really good in my opinion I did like the Live songs and Zack with Chuck D and especially 'F**K The Police'but where was 'Killing In The Name' or 'The Ghost of Tom Joad'? Through and through a decent CD, but easier to just record from a friend who has it."
2,Unsatisfying for a RATM fan...except his collection,"MOCK Sony Japan and the producers for having released such a poor collection of songs. Sony Japan didn't even seek Zach (main vocals) and the rest of the band's permission, and they just threw it out like that! I've listened to almost all of their songs and seen some of their live videos, but never have I heard such poor singing from Zach. I must say that a newbie would immediately be put off by Zach's uneasy singing on stage. However it's wierd status makes it must have in a fan's collection."
4,Most all Broadway movies will be a bomb!,"But this CD isn't. If you've ever had the opportunity to see a Forbidden Broadway show or hear one of their CDs, then you know this CD is going to be a treat.It's actually more accessible than some of the Forbidden Broadway recordings since almost everyone has seen the movies parodied on this CD and how many people have seen Blood Brothers or the musical version of Anna Karenina?Okay, some of the numbers are more annoying than funny, but on the whole, it rocks. My favorite lyric is from Audrey Hepburn's Eliza Doolittle singing Dub Me!Anyone who's ever heard me sing will tell you thatMy talent's wearing a hat!All in all, a very funny CD for movie and muscial fans."
4,Wonderfully Bitchy Laughs for Musical-Theatre Geeks,"Sometimes the satires on this album will poke fun at a movie or actor I greatly enjoy, but even so, I have to admit the cleverness of the songwriting. It's *smart* silly, to quote a friend of mine, and very well performed. Some of the impressions are hilarious in and of themselves (I want to know who was doing that lovely Julie Andrews intoned soprano in the Mary Poppins number, ""StupidCarelessFictionalNonsensicalVerboseness""!). Well worth a listen, though if you're not particularly into movies or musical theatre in general you may miss some of the point; likewise, if bitchy in-jokes annoy you, you'll probably hate this."
1,Did not deliver results as promised,"After using almost the entire box as instructed, there was no noticeable change. Was offered a free box when called customer service to request refund. Just seems to me if company is so sure product works, why make second box so freely available? Was assured that results would be seen after using second box, but very disappointed that claims of results in 7-days proved completely false."
3,It's ok,I bought this product and was expecting 84 strips but i only received fifty. There really wasnt any whitening and they were irritating because my mouth watered and i couldnt swallow because there was gel. I wouldnt recommend it.
4,They work...,"Oh come one, everyone uses these now, don't they? Well, you should. White strips are flimsy little pieces of film coated in some form of peroxide bleach (I assume) that is tooth safe. You pull out the strip, peel off the flimsy part and apply it to your front teeth. In about five minutes, you peel it off and voila! your teeth are lighter. You can really do this all day if you want- I'm not the manufacturer so I can say that. Just be sure to cover all the areas of your teeth or you'll have stripes! Hint- get down around the edges where your teeth meet up- just push the strip in with your fingernail. You can't eat or drink while they are in- so bonus!- you might lose an ounce. Teenagers use these by the ton- that's why they all have such sparkly smiles. It can't hurt you. But it is a little pricey. Lots of dentists throw in free teeth whitening when you first go to them. And using strips does require some dexterity."
2,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed. Had read some good reviews but we sent this back. The binding was very stiff; would not lay open anywhere in the Bible and took some effort to hold open. Doing so the pages crinkled badly. I was very surprised that Holman put out a product such as this. The price made the Bible attractive until you got it in your hands. Glad for Amazon's excellent return policy. The size was really good. My wife was looking for something easy to carry and hold, but the quality just wasn't there. Also it was okay as far as font size and white space but not that good. Was disappointed with that also."
2,waiting: to laugh?,"WAITING for me seemed very unsatisfying. It seemed like its really not a movie but small vignettes tied together. sure, one scene led to another but overall it seemed very predictable and at times boring. The movie tries way too hard for humor with shock value and unfortunately for the viewer-goes nowhere. I love gross humor like anyone else but this movie did not work for me. the characters were typical and uninteresting. the trailer was much funnier and basically it showed you the funniest moments. in the film those scenes came into the movies first 15 mins!!!!. the rest of the movie went down the drain. this is one restaurant worth closing."
3,it's a trip,"having worked at restaurants back in the day this film brought back some memorys at how some folks you work with can trip you out. this film has alot of laughs&will make you look all crazy at your plate the next time you go out for dinner.the Dishwasher is always the Smartest Person it always seems&has the best advice it always seems.this film does bring back some past experiences.it has some hit&Miss elements in it,but overall it's a pretty good film."
3,"Waiting sharp, but not enough bite.","As a person who has been waiting tables in a breakfast restaurant, I could appreciate a movie like this. However, it doesn't cover enough of the aggravation of working in food service. It touches on some of them, but does not exploit it enough. The script should have been more creative, such as inventing its own words to name problem customers. It would have also been more affective if this was a restaurant with 0 tolerence for hostile patrons. It had enough laughs for me to slightly recommend it."
2,Terrible Video Quality,"Story:If you haven't seen the film, it's pretty great overall. Certain aspects like the smoking inside the restaurant cause it to feel dated for me, but overall it's funny and Ryan Reynolds is great.Video Quality:The problem with the blu-ray is that it is among the worst quality blu-ray transfers I have ever seen. I only watch new films on blu-ray at 720p, and even at that resolution a high quality blu-ray looks stunningly different than a standard dvd.The video quality for this blu-ray is awful, instead of the picture being crisply detailed, it's like there's a filter that muddies and softens everything, literally. I would rather watch the DVD transfer than this blu-ray, and this is certainly not worth the additional money over the DVD. If you have any doubt, rent the blu-ray first, and then make your decision. Not a good transfer at all."
3,Yeah! Carpe deez nuts! God I can't wait to quit this job!,"In this movie, Ryan Reynolds plays a character very similar to the character he plays in Van Wilder, only within the confines of a restaurant, rather than a college campus.This movie is pretty funny, once you give it a chance. Ryan Reynolds is good in it and his supporting cast is actually pretty solid. Luis Guzman is hilarious, especially when he's describing the different ways to expose yourself to co-workers on the job.Although the movie was not quite as good as I was expecting upon my first viewing, I did enjoy it a bit more the second time I watched it with a friend. There is a good cast and some really good moments. It's probably worth watching if you liked Van Wilder - or if you like filthy comedy in general."
4,Interesting and Funny movie,"This movie was not anything like I was expecting. It was a totally different movie with many parts that were so gross that you couldn't help laugh. It also played on the fact of what real people working in a resturant do doing their time. It was great. I will admitt there were a coupld times when I was bored but over-all this movie is funny and keeps it coming with the raunchy jokes. If you perfer not to think about private body parts or hear about sex, then I suggest you don't see this movie. It is on the edge raw but in a funny, crazy way."
1,Boring - Not worth the time,"With the film Waiting, I thought I had ordered a humorous and raunchy farce. Instead, I was served an assortment of shallow, uninteresting one-note characters prepared with a tasteless glaze of sarcasm and covered in a mound of genitalia references.This supposed comedy was dull, dreary and, worst of all, not funny.Otherwise talented actors, Anna Faris, David Koetchner and Wendie Malick, are wasted in thin characters with nothing funny to say. Luis Guzman is the only one able to generate any laughs.Some compare the film to Clerks. The only real comparison is that the writer of Waiting seems to have lifted the character of Jay from Clerks and split him into the two busboy characters who attempt a pale imitation of Jason Mewes.If you feel you must watch a movie that spoofs the banal and corporate theme restaurants, watch Jennifer Aniston's scenes from Office Space. You'll laugh a lot more and save yourself over an hour's worth of time."
2,Funny and bizarre,"This movie is so bizarre but funny in certain ways. Take a chance and rent it, just for laughs."
5,The kind of humor that doubles you over and makes you cry,"If you've ever worked in a restaraunt..or ate in one for that matter...you should see this film!Ryan Reynolds is an absolute gem, this guys is going to have a long career. And the rest of the cast rounds out a rowdy bunch that we've all worked with before at one time or another. This would make a great TV series, like Alice on crack.The only grievance I have is Luis Guzman. He's not funny at all."
4,Pretty Funny!,And Anna Farris is hot!. So check this out!. Makes me think twice about going to a chain Restaurant!
3,Another in a Long Line of Tenn Comedies...,"Most reviewers have it right when they recommend this movie for anyone who enjoyed Van Wilder and that genre of movie. If you want to turn your brain off for over an hour and laugh at gross-out comedy and twenty-somethings complaining about their lives (while at the same time enjoying their lives thoroughly because of excessive amounts of alcohol and late night parties), then you will enjoy this tongue-in-cheek movie. Although the storyline is one that is used over and over and over again - in this instance, a guy graduating from college who is working at a restaurant sees someone he went to school with who is much more successful than he is, causing him to question his job at the TGI Friday's type restaurant and in turn his life path - the movie puts together a new spin on some often tired jokes. More than anything, the movie reminds all of us that you should never ever insult or piss off the people who handle your food. Who knows what they'll do to it."
4,Funny Movie That Will Leave You Amused.,"Ok, if you are looking for an intellectual movie to impress the new girl your dating this isnt it. If you want a feel good movie that will make you giggle this is it. The characters are very realistic having known people who acted exactly the same way. The story is not very developed, its really a character driven movie with a great cast. I thought all the acting was great but being a fan of Andy Milanokis I was a bit dissapointed. His role in the movie was weak and he wasnt funny. I definetly recommend this movie and it has a lot of good bonus features on the DVD too."
1,Not worth 90 minutes of your time,"Well there may have been the odd funny joke or too, but the humour in this is just toilet humour and nothing more.Not a film I would watch again!"
3,Wish it was packaged better,"I received this DVD on time but the case was broken when I received it which now prevents me from holding my DVD in it. Better packaging is all that I would like to see be changed. Other than that, everything was fine."
3,Waiting,"I enjoyed the movie,it wasn't quite what I had exspected,but I did enjoy it,and it played through pretty good on my p.c."
4,Great Film (with the exception of Ryan Reynolds),You really have to be in the Restaurant Business to truly appreciate this film.BTW Ryan Reynolds is a terrible actor and stinks up every movie set he walks onto.
1,Too bad I couldn't get a refund for this.,"No plot to speak of. Poorly written and really no story. If your into hearing the F word about every 2 minutes with little to no humor, then this is for you. If you've seen the commercials, then you've seen all of the funny parts.They did a good job of advertising this to make you think its funny... its very random and really doesn't follow any point other than to see how many times they can drop the F bomb. Not that there aren't funny movies that use the F bomb, but this one is so random, pointless, and not funny that it makes me wonder if it was written by an ADD pre-teen.If you must see it, rent it, you wont want to be out the extra cash for buying it. F-"
2,Grow up!,"Let's be honest here. This is your typical immature teen movie. The ""grossness"" of this film didn't bother me but rather the immaturity and trite humor that seems to be apparent in every one of these ""teen movies""...It's as if they give middle schoolers the task of writing the scripts. It's just annoying beyond belief. I'll admit the only reason I actually decided to watch this movie and rated it 2 stars was because Dane Cook was in. I figured, being a huge fan of his comedy, that this one might actually make me laugh..WRONG. He barely had any parts, and those were the only parts that were funny. But they were few and far between. I also want to note how cheesy Ryan Renyolds charcatar was..I cant quite pin if it was his acting or what, but it was painful to watch. I hope the adults who enjoy this grow up and quit laughing at ""wee wee"" jokes."
1,I dunno have a title cause the things hasent gotten here yet.,"Great movie, good thing Ive seen it before.For the simple fact I still haven't received the DVD says still in transit for over one month."
4,funny,hilarious movie with lots of laughs but it makes you not want to go to a restaurant for awhile :)
3,Better than I thought it would be,"I'm as big a fan of the gross out comedy as the next guy, but something about this one seemed like it would stink. With those low expectations, I found myself laughing quite a bit. I've aged a bit past the young man trying to find his place in the world, it still added some weight to an otherwise simple film. Also, when you tuck it back between your legs, it's a fruit bowl, not a donkey. When you then bounce up and down and neigh, then it's a horsey."
3,"3 1/2 stars - let me see the GOAT! ""Office Space"" part 2?","A pretty funny movie. You WILL laugh out loud several times. The problem here is that the story is, obviously, all based around a single restaurant atmosphere. It becomes a bit tedious at times and some of the dialogue was just a little bit off. Ryan Reynolds is great, but playing basically the same character as in Van Wilder. Luis Guzman is hilarious, especially his first scene where he explains how to expose your bag of nuts for extra points.There are much better films such as ""Office Space"", ""Van Wilder"", ""Harold and Kumar"" and ""American Pie"", but this film is still worthy, especially if you actually are a waiter or waitress."
1,dumb,This movie is overrated and a waste of time. dont waste your time watching it. and it isnt even funny
5,Damn Funny Movie!!,"This one is well worth a look. It made me laugh til I cried.If you like ridiculous comedy movies, watch this one. It's out there, and good because of it.Highly reccomended if you liked Harold & Kumar or Supertroopers, for example."
5,Waiting...the best movie ever,"As a chef, i saw this movie in the theatres with my whole crew. All of us loved it. A word of caution however, if you haven't worked in a restraunt, you probably won't get the majority of the jokes in this movie. having worked in a restraunt, this movie is easily one of the funniest movies of all time"
3,A nice book that still needs to be written,"I was very excited to get this book, having been to London several times and hoping that I would now be given information about the really great stuff that I had, heretofore, missed. I was vaguely disappointed. Though I would not say this book was a total waste, neither did I use it very much on my next trip.The book has a chatty, friendly syle but it is not very substantive, which is frustrating because one has the feeling that Ms. Cornblath knows more than she is letting on. It is rather as if you are getting advice from a knowledgeable friend who is rushing out the door.Some establishments are recommended but hours and phone numbers are not given. A good index.I would use this book as a supplement. It might perhaps even serve as a preamble to your trip, using it to establish an itinerary. But it would not be an adequate guide on its own."
5,very cute mobile,"classic pooh is the theme for my sons nursery, and we recieved this mobile as a baby shower gift. he's loved it sice we brought him home. the cute little melody puts him back to sleep easily, and when he's awake he loves staring up at his little friends circling above him. the characters are also very soft and cuddly and can be easily removed for baby to play with. the only complaint i have about this is that the music does not last very long you have to stand there and wind the thing up every minute or so unil baby goes to sleep. but it is adorable and definitely a must if you have the classic pooh nursery."
5,musical mobile,I absolutely love this mobile! It goes perfectly with my other classic Winnie the Pooh collection.
2,Music Doesn't Last Long Enough,"This is a very cute product, but the music only seems to play for a few minutes, which wasn't nearly long enough to get our baby off to sleep. He loved watching the mobile, but then it would stop and he would start crying again in no time. Finally he grew into the ""grabby"" stage and mobiles were no longer safe over the crib, so I ""recycled"" the parts. I cut off the little stuffed toys and put them in his crib. He likes them and they have withstood several machine washings. I also give him the little music box to play with (with supervision). But to sooth your baby to sleep, you need a different product."
3,"So Far, So Good","I just got these, so I havent had a real opportunity to break them in. The fit is true to size. As a matter of fact, they fit snuggly so I had to wear thin socks. I like the way they feel on carpet, since I do Zumba on a regular basis. The she allows me to do all the moves with foot support and flexibility of the shoe."
3,Look great but small,"These shoes looked cute but were way too small. Unfortunately, I had to send them back. I will probably order the next size up."
4,They Run Small,"Capezio has a very limited amount of dance sneakers, but of the four that I have seen, I really like the style of the FIERCE. I ordered them, they were delivered very timely, but they were not true to size. I did not have the insight to order a size larger. So because I didn't want the hastle of a return, I am dancing in a shoe that is snug to my toes.The sneakers themselves are great. I glide across the floor and make transitions very easily."
3,too small,Man!!!! I am a size 11.5 and ordered size 13 and they are still too small!!! I wore them anyway to do zumba yesterday but was aware of my toes touching. Another half size up would have been perfect. They are comfortable shoes though. 40 minutes into the workout my feet started getting numbe. Not sure if it is because of the toes touching the front or what.
2,Too small,"I had to send these back, so can't really review the quality of the shoe. It fit really small. I'm a size 7 almost always, and I think I would have had to go a full size larger. Didn't want to take the chance."
4,size up!,"I wear a 7 but ordered a 7 1/2 since that was the only size available. Getting by, but an 8 probably would have given me more toe room."
3,Width-----too narrow!,"I have been a dancer for years and own a pair of Capezio canvas dansneakers as well as a pair of Sansha ""Skazz"" dance sneakers. I wrongly assumed that since the ""Fierce"" were from Capezio, that their sizing and width would be consistent. Not. These will have to be returned.Unfortunately, these shoes are a huge disappointment. They are far too narrow! I could barely get these shoes on and going up another half size will not help (know from experience).I will order a new pair of Sanshas (sold here on Amazon). Down side with the Sansha (perhaps all practice dance shoes) is that padding wears out fairly quickly. If you are new to wearing dance sneakers, remember to replace them when the padding breaks down and that can be as early as four to five months. The exterior of the shoe can and will often look ""perfect"". Replace your shoes once you start having foot or calf discomfort."
1,Size issue,I wear size 6 shoes and ordered size 7.5. It turned out too big so I have to returned it. Not working on zumba class if I got smaller size either. It was too slippery on wood floor.
1,Size ran extremely small,"I got the shoes ok, but I was completely surprised at how they fit! These shoes felt like a size 6 and they were supposed to be an 8. I HAD to send them back when my daughter who wears a 7 couldn't even get them on!"
1,no arch support,"The arches are mesh and I tore a ligament in my foot doing zumba. The bottons really slide and contort your foot in unnatural ways. Some people have suggested wearing them outside to scuff up so they wouldn't slide so much. I love zumba, but am out of it for at least 6 weeks. The sizing for me was 1.5 sizes larger than I normally wear, which I learned from feed back and is true."
5,Great shoe for a great price.,"I ordered these shoes with free super-saver shipping. There must be a nearby service center because the package arrived in 2 days. I am so delighted to receive these early! I shopped around for Zumba shoes and dance sneakers for a week before choosing this item - a stylish dance sneaker at a good price. I really wanted red shoes, but found none in my size for a reasonable price that I liked. These came laced with black laces, and included a second pair of red shoe laces which ""add the flavour"" with the other red accents on the heel and tongue. I ordered 1 size up from my street size based on other reviews and my medium width foot. The shoes looked small in the box, but are a perfect fit. I will update my review after I Zumba in them for a week."
3,Not Satisfied,"When I initially tried on the shoe, it was a little snug and hurt my feet the first time I wore them to dance class. However, after that the fit was fine. My problem is that I've had the shoe for only two weeks (4 classes a week) and the outside stitching of the right shoe is unraveling. I'm very upset about this."
2,Small and narrow,"Even thought the product description says to order one full size up, I wasn't prepared for how narrow this shoe is. I could barely slide my foot into the 9.5 (I'm usually a 8.5M/W) and could not move my toes. Returning for refund."
3,awfully small!!!!,"I new because of other reviews that they came in very small sizes, but this is too much. I wear a shoe size 6.5. I order a 7.5!!! and it was too small. I have to order another pair, impossible to return ( I live outside the US). Be aware!! Otherwise, they seem quite comfortable and they don't get stuck on the floor, they slide."
2,dance sneakers,I bought these for doing zumba dance classes. They seem like a good shoe but run very small. had a hard time getting the right fit. Definitely order a size up.
2,Dissappointed,Unfortunately the shoes have some sort of defect issue. Heels have bunched up and daughter can not wear them to wear they are not comfortable.
4,GOOD ZUMBA SHOE!,I have gotten addicted to Zumba and the shoes that I were wearing weren't cutting it so I took the advice of my instructor and she told me to try this shoe. I ordered one size up and realize that I should have ordered one and half size up but otherwise they are ok. My knees are thankful too. Wearing gym shoes to Zumba and then going from them to wearing the Capezios shoes made a BIG difference. I would order again. I wish they would come in different colors and remember ORDER A SIZE AND A HALF!
4,Pretty happy with this shoes but yes take one size up...,"I was glad that I found this shoes as Amazon had it with free shipping. Got it for less than 35 bucks (shipped). Anyway, I took to consideration all the comments and ordered one size up and it works beautifully. I wish it's a bit wide though but it does not cost a major inconvenience for me. I used it for my Zumba classes and it is great. I used to control my movements because the tennis shoes I used to wear sticks to the floor and any wrong move may injure my knees. With this one, I still have to do a bit of controlling but it's more on slipping depending on the dance floor surface. In my case, it's a shiny wood flooring."
4,Nice dancing shoes,I bought these for my niece and she's very happy with them. The shoes are comfortable and she loves them.
3,The fit was good but the shoe looked clunky,"I wear a size 11 street shoe and purchased a 13. It was a good fit, but the shoe itself was clunky, especially at the ankles. I dance in Black Bloch Boost DRT's and appreciate the sleekness of that shoe. I thought I would give these a try since I am in search of a nice looking white pair of dance sneakers in addition to my black ones. I sent these back to Amazon the next day with no problems from Amazon. On to another pair."
4,non-marking isn't,"I just tried my new Capezio DS11 Fierce Dansneakers out for the first time at my ZumbaGold class Friday. The fit is fine (I ordered a 10 1/2 because my street shoe size is 9.) The support is great. The only problem I had was that I had purchased them thinking they would be ""non-marking soles"" as it states in the details. They are definitely NOT non-markijng. The floor we have to dance on had just been re-waxed and buffed, and I felt awful about the black marks all over my dance space!! Is there a way to solve this problem?"
2,SIZING REALLY OFF!,I purchased these shoes from a Capezio store. I normally wear an 8 1/2 or 9 in street shoes. I got these in a size 10. Big mistake!! These shoes run very short and I have a narrow to medium foot. The hard rubber at the tip is very uncomfortable if your toe even remotely touches the front of the shoe. I've worn them several times and am now on Amazon looking for something else.
4,Nice shoe too snug!,"Capezio is a good brand was looking forward to wearing in Zumba but ordered too small. Didn't like the too flexible arch, not enough support."
4,Capezio dance sneaker,"I did like the shoe, but my instructor said it wasn't the right type of shoe for Zumba class, which I ordered it for. You slid nice on the wooden floor, but she was concerned because of the open sole that I would get shin splints."
3,Good shoe for Zumba,"Good shoe for Zumba class - smoother on bottom to help pivot without hurting your knees. A little hard in the sole, so a little less comfortable. Definitely a little narrow width. I wear an 8-8.5, got the 9, & think maybe I should have bought the 9.5 due to the width!! Still a decent shoe.NOTE ---- ended up buying a new pair in a 9.5 & they fit much better!! I bought the rockit one for a little more $. Great for ZUMBA!"
2,Sizing is a problem,"I wear a women's medium width size 9 athetic shoe and ordered this shoe in a women's 10 1/2, based on reviews. The shoe is still too short and the toes are extremely narrow. Very uncomfortable! These shoes are going back."
4,Best Zumba Shoes,I got the Capezio Fierce sneakers since November.I absolutely love them for Zumba! They feel very light in comparisonWith regular aerobic sneakers! They run small for sizeI am 7 and bought and 8. Next time I will get an 8 1/2!
3,Sizing Error,"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this item. After hearing the positive comments from some of the ladies in my Zumba class I decided to try the Capezio DS11. I'm currently on my second purchase and still can't seem to get the correct size. I wear a size 9 which was the initital size purchased. Had to return it for a half size larger, then to find out that they too did not fit. I just returned the 9.5 and ordered a 10 in hopes that this will work for me. They say third try is a charm so maybe I will have better luck this time. I do believe however, that either the manufacturer or Amazaon should make mention of this sizing error somewhere in the product discription of the this item for customers such as myself that may overlook other written reviews prior to purchase."
3,Order size up,"These shoes run very short as the toe box was very confining for me. I will have to order at least one size up, but I think they will work out very well in the right size. Great support and slick (but not too slick) for Zumba sliding!"
2,Disappointed,"This shoe was not the correct size. It was several sizes smaller and I could not even get it on.Because it was sent in separated boxes but part of the same order, I had to pay separate shipping on each item to return and lost my discount for buying and ended up paying over $15 for a badly sized product.Very disappointed."
5,The best dance shoes ever,"This is my second pair. I have a hard time with shoes because my feet are pretty wide. I usually buy an 8 1/2 so my feet won't hurt though lengthwise I'm a 7 1/2. I was worried when I read that you have to buy them a size and a half too big. So I bought the first pair 2 sizes too big. These shoes are so light and the fit is so adjustable I never noticed. I danced and worked out, walked all day in them in comfort until I wore them out. This time I got them a size and a half bigger than my size and I can't see why I'd ever buy another brand. For the money, you'll never beat them."
4,love the shoe,I love the shoe wish they made a high top in the same material. The shoe is comfortable and flexable.
4,Great for the price,"I bought these for my Zumba classes, and they made a world of difference compared to the regular sneakers I had been wearing. They're a very good value for the price. I do recommend ordering one size up - I normally wear a 10, but ordered an 11 based on other reviews and they fit perfectly."
4,great shoe!,"this is a great zumba shoe with just the right amount of spin. i miss the cushion of my gym shoes, though, during high-impact workouts. after reading other reviews i originally ordered 1 1/2 sizes up from my normal size (7). i returned the first pair and got an 8 instead and that works much better, still a little big but comfortable to dance in, so i would advise going just 1 size up."
2,Not happy with used item!,"I followed the suggestions from all the other reviews and ordered 7.5 originally (I usually wear 6.5 for street shoes). Unfortunately, that was a little short. So I returned that pair by paying the returning fee, and ordered a 8.0 right away.I was hoping to get a great pair and use that immediately in my Zumba class! How wrong I was!!They sent me a 8.0, an used one!I can surely tell it has been used, because the lace was not in its original shape, and they forgot about the spare lace that the 7.5 pair came with!Well, I have to return it again, and I'm not sure if I should give it another chance.Very unhappy experience.But, the size 8 was fitting me ok."
4,capezio dansneakers,"they are great for dance exercize. however, one needs to buy them a whole size bigger,especially if one's feet are wide, because they run rather small. i was advised to buy a half size bigger than my usual shoe size, but that was not enough, so need to get them at a whole size bigger than your usual shoe size."
2,Shoes aren't good but customer service is great!,"I bought two different brands of these shoes, the Capezios, through Amazon, are really hard and not comfortable at all. I bought them one and a half size larger than my regular street shoes, and they still felt tiny. I had to return them, doing that I lost the S&H fees, about 10 bucks, but customer service at the store (Second Skin Shoes) was excellent, they were very fast and very nice. I would definitely buy from them again, but not this specific pair shoes. I ended up getting Bloch dance shoes that fit perfect!"
1,No support,"I had to return these shoes. There is no cushion at all and using it for Zumba was hard on the bottom of my feet, my ankles and knees. I used inserts for arch support and cushion and it was ok but the way the shoes were made tend to shift my weight forward, causing more pressure on the balls of my feet. It felt un-natural and uncomfortable so I had to return it. For those who needs cushion and arch support, these shoes are not it. Will continue to try other shoes."
3,My Opinion,"I got these shoes for a Zumba class. I bought 1 1/2 sizes larger than my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly and are comfortable. But, I wore them once and found them to be way too slippery on the floor the class is held on (polished wood gym floor). While it is easy to slide and pivot, lunges and squats are impossible to hold and control. The workout aspect is more important to me than danceability so I went back to wearing my running shoes to class. There is another woman in the class who wears the Capezio Fierce and likes them, so I will try to wear them again to see if I can adapt. Maybe there is a way to scuff up the bottoms a bit. That aside, the shoes are well made and were affordable. For just dancing, they'd be great."
3,I screwed up!,"I didn't research these enough - they apparently run 2 sizes smaller than your regular shoe size. Needless to say, I never sent them back and will be giving them to my friend's daughter."
2,Way too small,Purchased shoes but gave them away. Reviews say buy one size larger and I did but they were still too small. I wear a 9.5 in all shoes except these I needed an 11 so I went with a different style and gave these away.
4,Description was incomplete,The book was in good shape for the price I paid. My only complaint is that the binding is loose and the pages are separated from it on the bottom half of the book. This was not mentioned in the book's description.
2,Composition 1,"This is book is not terrible, but I was quite disappointed by the vulgar content in some of the selections. Also, too many four-letter words in there for me."
2,Seriously lacking in example explanations,"To be fair, this is not an easy subject. However, they give a short chapter on XPath, and then thrust you into XSLT. That would not be bad IF, during their weak XSLT explanations they would also explain the XPath in their examples. Not only are the explanations weak, but the writing style of the authors is not clear and intuitive. Don't get me wrong, they do explain them, but not clearly.I have been reading Wrox books for several years now, I have always learned a lot from them, but I have to say this is the absolute worst Wrox book I have ever read. I would suggest finding a different book.Sorry Wrox, I normally very much enjoy your books."
2,"Not well layed out, poor flow","It seems this book was put together in a hurry. Lots of authors contributing to the portions they may understand or use. They don't mention who wrote what but as the reader moves from chapter to chapter, the language and writing style changes dramatically.I would not recommend this book to others."
4,Great product,I've had this product for about four months and I love it. It really is useful to have the full motion of this mount. I'm ultra satisfied.
4,Universal Flat Panel Mount,"This product arrived quickly and in good condition but the installers said that the mounting screws did not line up easily during the installation. It was their opinion that the product may have been a ""second"" since they had not experienced this problem with a Sanus mount before. It was fine in everyother aspect."
4,Get out the tool box,"Instructions are easy to use.Worked well on a 40"" LCD DisplayI was concerned about the screen tilt but after being mounted it balances very nicely and provides an easy way to adjust for minor movements."
4,Solid Arm,Pro: Very solid and stable arm. Adjustable enough to do do all the motion you might want.Con: Says it will extend 20 from the wall. Not sure it goes quite that far.
4,Good Full Movement Wall Mount,"The Universal Flat Panel Mount works great for my 40 inch LCD TV. Very easy to install, good price, and adjust easily. My only complaint is the wire management is not as good as the more expensive wall mounts. Overall I am very happy with this mount."
2,BEWARE - CHECK IT CAREFULLY,"This is a good mount, well constructed. The advertisement that it fits TVs up to 40"" is misleading. Use the VESA mount-specification of your TV, not the screen size. Once you've verified the compatibility, this is a good choice."
1,Not universal VESA bracket ! !,"Contrary to the product description, this Sanus flat screen full-motion wall bracket does NOT fit my 32"" Toshiba LCD. The TV does have a VESA mount area, but the bracket on the Sanus is WAY too small. The Sanus says it is for flat screens up to 40"" and 100lb. I had to go to Radio Shack and buy another bracket to mount to the Sanus then mount that to the Toshiba. Cost me an extra $99..."
5,Great purchase,"I purchased this mount because I needed to be able to watch tv from both straight on and also 90 degrees away from the wall it's mounted on. I have a 32"" tv.The mount is extremely solid and moves with ease (and this can be easily adjusted so it moves with a very light touch, or with more force if you want it to stay put). The metal is very sturdy and would have no issues putting a 40"" tv on it. It pivots all the way to 90 degrees, so it is perpendicular to the wall it is mounted on. When I want it against the wall, it folds up nicely, giving the appearance that it is statically mounted on the wall. it only sticks out a couple of inches.Wire management is acceptable but not idea- it comes with zip tie like clips that snap into the bracket.I would buy another one of these in a heartbeat if I had the need. Amazon has a relatively great price on this as usual."
1,Did anyone actually edit this book?,"I find it appalling that in a college level textbook there would be spelling errors, problems that just don't make sense (i.e. a problem referring to making four plots but failing to say what they should be of), and untested matlab scripts. This book looks like it was written on a whim and doesn't really cover matlab, it just presents mathematical problems that should be solvable in matlab, but without providing any examples or information in the text to help."
1,Incomprehensible 'Introductory' text,"The text tries to cover far too much material, and makes too many assumptions about prior knowledge of linear algebra for an 'introductory' book. Further, the author seems to labour under the belief that deciphering Matlab code is the most intuitive way to understand complex mathematical ideas. Explanations are scant, and often sketchy. There are several concepts in the book that could each fill semester long maths courses, but are treated in two page sections. It is a real shame that this book was chosen for the course, because it has left me with little understanding (or appreciation, for that matter) of the material it attempts to cover."
1,If you like to read calculator manuals page by page,"If you like to read calculator books then by all means buy this book (all description, no explanation). Unlike ""real"" math books that promote a sense of learning by example and description. Van Loan's book presents nothing but a bunch of symbols with no explanation of where these symbols are coming from. The section on interpolation has all of 3 graphs showing the concepts he is emphasizing. Leaving the reader to solve for coefficients they really have no clue about until they refresh on the beginning of the chapter.The explanations are brief and the examples are not concrete. This is quite possibly the worst book I have encountered in my college career. But then again my University does not require linear algebra before the course that uses this book, and I'm sure that has something to do with my fustration with this text."
1,The worst book,This is probably the worst book in Scientific computation. This book doesnot explain any topic in depth. It's a waste of money to buy this book.
5,Yes! A brilliant collection of Coleman-songs!,"Don`t worry, I won`t fuss around. I`ll just tell you why you should buy this album: first of all, Cy Coleman is a fantastic composer and you`re gonna like his songs as long as you like Broadway musicals; and: if you like and know Coleman-show`s you`ll even find some songs you don`t know yet and they sound just brilliant. Well and of course credits to Randy Graff who does a great job and makes this record to a must for every Broadway musical fan...(sorry, I guess, I did fuss around, didn`t I? Anyway, go ahead, buy it!)"
4,GREAT DEBUT BY THE STROKES!!!,"IS THIS IT, The STROKES debut is BY FAR their best album...All the songs are nice...some classics like HARD TO EXPLAIN, LAST NIGHT and THE MODERN AGE...After this great album, the STROKES created more cool rock songs, but also A LOT of not so memorable ones and A LOT of fillers..."
2,did anyone just say over-rated?,"Hi there. I'm a pretentious music snob. There, got it out in the open. I'll listen to music from any genre, if its original, melodically and texturally nteresting, or evocative. Now the Strokes aren't THAT bad. Honest. There cheesily obvious watered down iggy meets the smiths in a run down bar. They llok pretty and wear distressed threads. Their alright. Whats the fuss all about?NME's falling circulation perhaps...In no way the saviours of anything, except their probably quite ample insurance plans, the Strokes will fade within 3 yrs guarenteed. Its the last thrashings of those who cannot accept that the most interesting work is happening in electronica, arty metal, underground hip hop, avant-jazz etc.Grow up."
2,Just Good,"I bought this 3 months ago and still find it difficult to differ one song to another. Every song sounds the same. Still a good record, but didn't have the soul."
5,One of the best CDs of last year,"I bought this CD after watching the video for ""Last Nite"". I was pleasantly surprised to find that all of the songs on the CD are as good if not better than ""Last Nite"". Highlights include ""The Modern Age"", ""Barely Legal"", ""Someday"", and ""Hard to Explain"". This is one of the only CDs that I have bought recently that I can listen to the whole way through."
2,Simple,"I'm sure everyone knows ""Last Nite"". The video to that song was great, and was what got me interested in The Strokes to begin with. But having purchased their album, I was disappointed to find that what I thought would be a simple yet refreshing style is nothing more than simple. Lead singer Julian Casablancas uses the same radio effect on his vocals on practically every track, which becomes very irritating to listen to. I want to hear some variation from someone who is obviously a very good singer. It's the same deal throughout the entire album, with all the band members showing flashes of talent every once in a while, but not often enough for this album to be anything other than 11 tracks of exactly the same sound. They've taken their simple, energetic style and stretched it over an entire CD. Yawn. These guys should take some time with their next album, try and explore different themes and styles on the same CD, and above all else, ignore the hype. Guys, you're not that good yet."
2,hmmmm........i think they're pulling our leg.,"the strokes are definitely one of the best marketed bands to come around in a while; so i won't get too personal, i'm sure they're just a bunch of young pretty boys having fun. but the saviors of rock and roll? come on, man. to 'save rock and roll' in this day and age -- if we are to believe the strokes are the ones doing it -- is merely to prop up a cliched corpse and hope no one says anything disparaging.there is so much exciting and groundbreaking new music out there right now -- why jerk off to this stuff?if they hadn't gotten so big, they would have been a fun band to see on a friday night in nyc... but not too much more than that, not if you're looking for something that sticks to your ribs.peace (and borrow this cd before you buy, everyone and their dog has this)"

4,good album!,"Hmmm...a while since I've written a review and I might well just type ... here. But this album is very good, so I had to write something. Well, I bought it in the first place to be a bit of a fashion ...; album to put on the coffee table. But...it's very good. Not over-produced American rock (thank God, don't care if it's a gimmick, I want mistakes, feedback etc), good delivery - spirit, good songs - not over-produced, good riffs, spirit of 77 hiding in there...they're self consciously cool, yeah...but we want our rock bands to be cool don't we? Bit of posing is encouraged by me, so long as they stay...fairly punky. They don't want to believe their hype, or go too big time."
5,Big Bill's #1 of 2001.,"In a year that produced several outstanding CD's, this one is the best. Not only the best of this year, possibly the best CD released since I've been alive (1972). A future Hall of Fame canidate, this one is equally good as such heavyweights as ""The Velvet Underground & Nico"", The Stooges ""Fun House"", and Television's ""Marquee Moon"". 30 years from now, this one will still be around...guaranteed."
3,Nice debut album.,"Ok, I do admit that The Stokes have been hyped up a lot. But it is for good reason. Although still fairly immature in their sound, the Strokes show a decent level of talent. Some people have gone as far to call them the next Beatles. In my eyes that's an exaggeration. The Beatles changed the world. I don't think that will happen with the Strokes. What this album offers the listener is a chance to escape from typical pop-music sound."
1,all hype and no rock,"These guys are hyped as ""springing from the NY club scene."" Well, I live in NY. Almost all my friends are, if not in bands themselves, then avid followers of the local punk, garage, psychobilly and related music scenes. The first anyone I know heard of The Strokes is that they were signed to a major and they were being pushed as the next Big Thing. They have nothing to do with the scene here. They're basically just young kids whose parents have good connections in the record industry. There are dozens of unsigned, unheralded bands in NY who blow these kids away. Seek out those bands. Ignore this pale imitation of rock."
1,NO originality!,"If you want the real talent GO buy anything by the Velvet Underground or The Stooges, Can -- It is unfortunate that they have made a slight fortune off of great talents like Lou and Iggy. I guess it pays to have daddy warbucks hand you a career on a silver platter.These guys do not need your money -- they have nice big trust funds that allow them to be ""starving artist"" poseurs."
3,the modern age,"it's tough to listen to this album straight-through, because there's not enough variety between the tracks. i suppose that's why the album isn't any longer than it is. i think the album would be a lot better if it were shortermost of the tracks on this album are mediocre, having one or two great, catchy guitar parts and/or really awesome singing parts. the big exceptions, though, are the first two songs ""is this it?"" and ""the modern age"", which are entirely excellent and offer more than most modern bands which don't even have one entirely excellent song""someday"" and ""last nite"" are pretty darn good, too.other highlights of this album:""ah! hehe, i meant AH! hehe, no i didn't mean that at all."" lmao; wow, pure geniusstupid, obvious, yet entirely catchy choruses such as ""new york city clubs! new york city clubs!..""and parts where he goes entirely energetically crazy"
1,you have got to be kidding me,"I still habe a hard time believing that this CD and bands like this one actually sell CDs to anyone other than 10 year old kids trying to learn how to play the guitar, and yet, we have people actually listening and enjoying this drivel. Has the rock world and record companies sunk so low that they have to sell this junk by shoving it down your throat by having the radio stations play it a minimum of 5 times a day? there is no attempt at creative song making, creative lyrics, nor anything more than a simple beat, the same riff, and bass line, and a very boring singer who's hardly on key. bottom line: dont buy this CD, dont waste your money, unless you wanna buy into the whole ""im a drone and pawn of record companies and radio stations and listen to what i am told is cool"" genre, cause this is boring, mindnumbing and just a tad awful, Hey Amazon, where's the zero star button?"
4,"Yea, this is it.","I bought this album because of the hype and critical acclaim by itself, which is enough to convince me to buy an album. I didnt like it at first, but once the melodies of the songs start to sink in its a wonderful CD. Its alot like Weezer- nothing too special, good, short, rock songs, and somehow it works. The standout tracks to me are numbers 3, 6, and 7. Their new song that I saw on MTV2 after i purchased the album is a catchy song you'll find yourself singing for days. It has a great melody, and takes us back to the style of the 70's. This whole album sounds a bit like a 70's druggie album, actually. And that could be a good thing. With all this nu metal, death metal, alternative rap stuff thats out now, its great to have just a good, lo-fi, organic rock band. Its all up to them to save rock. Its a big task, but I think they'll be able to do it. Last Nite has just made top 20 on the Modern Rock charts, and I see it being a big hit. Definately buy this."
1,Why Do I Read Album Reviews?,"All of the accolades and hype lavished on this album and on The Strokes themselves are about as easy for me to understand as a typical episode of ""The Power Rangers."" To even suggest that The Strokes are heirs to The Velvet Underground's twisted vision of some 30 years ago and to mention them in the same breath as Television and, in some camps, Johnny Thunders, is just wrong. A more accurate comparision might be Jonathan Richman & The Modern Lovers, as ""Is This It"" features jangly guitars way up in the mix, which is great, but songs that just never seem to go anywhere, which is bad. Call me a dinosaur, but I'm still a big fan of songs that have a beginning, middle, and end. Brings back bad memories of the good money I threw after Joe Strummer's ""X-Ray"" album. Back to the drawing board, guys..."
2,"Hype-1, Strokes-0","The most appropriately titled album of the year.Okay, it's not that it's a BAD album, it's just a little wanting for ideas. Hopefully, they'll be able to ignore the hype (and inevitable backlash) and write something a little less self-conscious next time out."
1,I feel cheated,"I feel cheated by this release. I know that The Strokes are trying to circumvent this by releasing another DVD later this year, but I feel a certain sense of entitlement for having found The Strokes' music sooner, rather than later. I first bought the album on Ebay when the ship date was pushed back, and then I even bought the US copy for When It Started (terrible compared to NYC Cops). I don't want to have to spend more money on a product other people get for ""falling in,"" so to speak. I will still buy the DVD when it comes out...I really like The Strokes, but I don't condone this sneaky tack that they have taken up."
1,"If you have NO taste AT ALL in music, you'll love this B.S.","I can't believe that people actually buy this B.S.!!!!! There is obviously a large market for absolutely TASTELESS ""music"" (and I use that word as loosely as it possibly can). How these talentless individuals (I will NOT call the musicians for that would be a HUGE insult to TRUE musicians all around the world) got signed I have NO idea. Some idiot with a lot of money and perhaps a BIG favor being owed obviously conned someone into it. And a lot of idoit sheep follow the ""trend"" of people who have NO idea what good music is."
2,way way way to overhyped,this band was way to overhyped. They pull you in with awesome singles like on this cd Last Night which is awesome and the only reason I got this cd and then they put out 10 crappy songs to compliment their great songs. Wait 5 years before coming out with your next cd Strokes that way you can weed out the crap and come out with a decent cd because you can do it.
2,Meh,"Not much here. The whole album is very repititous. All in all it's standard, and not much more.I wouldn't mind the standard chords and rather bland instrumentation if the lyrics were there to back it, but they aren't. As another reviewer said, there's nothing here that's new or innovative. That said it's not horrendous, but also not particularly enjoyable."
5,Best album of 2001!!,"I bought this album when it first came out in September, and it is still my favorite CD 3 months later. There is something about this CD that takes you back in time. You feel like you are walking the streets of New York in 1979 when glam and fast, loud rock was all the rage. Lets just say you need to buy this CD as soon as possible. This is only their first Cd and The Strokes are going to only get better."
4,VU,"I was convinced that The Strokes sounded uncannily like The Velvet Underground, but when I brought it up with some friends of mine, they didn't hear the similarities. I'm listening to Is This It? right now, and I keep thinking of VU songs like ""I'm Waiting for the Man"", ""What Goes On"", ""Beginning to See the Light"", ""Lisa Says"", and ""White Light/White Heat"", to name a few. The VU is my all-time favorite band, and those are some great songs, so I'm definitely enjoying Is This It?"
4,You have to enjoy The Strokes for what they are,"I would like to warn you right now, if you are buying this record and expecting The Stooges or The Velvet Underground(The lead singer sounds like Lou Reed though) then you'll be highly disappointed nor is this the greatest rock 'n' roll album in years but it sure is damn good. At best, this album sounds like an indie version of ""Loaded."" When I first heard the record, I thought 'what is the big deal?' but it grew on me. You just can't listen to it with all the hype that The Strokes have been getting in your head. You just have to enjoy it for what it is. The highlight tracks are ""Barely Legal,"" ""Someday,"" ""Last Nite,"" and ""Trying Your Luck."" This album is all about being young and cool and everyone being full of it (Girlfriends esp.) ""Is This It?"" is highly addictive and worth your money but it 'aint no Velvet Underground record."
3,who wants to be a rock 'n roll star anyway,"hype schmype - this reminds me of a few years ago when a band called jonathan fire eater was supposed to be the next big thing and they quickly disappeared. the strokes also have the same problem, too cool for their own good. the strokes are a decent band, but they are nothing new. lyrics are a bit better than what's on the radio - but the music itself is rehashed iggy pop and lou reed. if you want good rock, try built to spill or sunny day real estate or superchunk. there is plenty of good rock bands out there - the problem is that not all of them want to be rock stars so the media won't pick up on them."
4,Great little album,"Is This It is a great album, however, the media have blown The Strokes out of proportion. Too eager for a band to replicate the sounds of the 60s and 70s, they have ignored the fact that for an album to be truly amazing, it has to be innovative, like nothing that's gone before.That said, it is a great little album, which brings back memorys, shuffling along in its jazzy garage punk kinda way. Great tunes like Is This It, Barely Legal, Someday and Hard To Explain make it worth owning. But the album, for all its enthusiasm and punky energy, lacks any kind of vivid or heartbreaking emotion, and all truly wonderful and classic albums need this ingredient. It will, however, sit in my collection as one of the coolest albums of 2001."
1,Don't Buy It,I'm not going to waste time repeating the names of the bands they ripped off. Several people have already listed them. I saw an interview with them; they seemed shallow and self-conscious. I saw their boring and pretentious video. They look like pseudo-junkie Banana Republic models. Rock n' roll is dead. Buy the old stuff and stop whining.
1,"in a word, boring",that's about all there is to say. do not waste your money on this stuff -- it's a lot cheaper and more enjoyable to just dig out those old VU records. it is sad that corporate america has coopted the underground.
2,Saviors of rock 'n roll?? WHAT!?,"OK, you can say whatever you like about these guys -- good, bad, boring, exciting, original, rip-offs (personally I find it to be incredible shallow sounding and boring), but they are SO far from being ""saviors of rock n' roll"" it's not even funny. FACT: This CD DOES NOT ROCK. Just a warning before you buy. It is very limp rock, and this is inarguable. Whether you like that style or not is another story, and you have a right to your opinion... Hype or no hype, this simply ain't rocking music, folks."
4,yeeeeeesssssss,"This is a godd debut(not the best) and (in my opinion) better than room on fire. It sounds like the stooges playing television-esqe(????????) riffs with ol' julian trying his hardest to sound like a more passionate lou reed(he sounds A LOT like him on ""modern age""). The guitars are pretty simple like the stooges, but spikier and more wirery like television. dig it? And everything is poppier, while trying to seem intelligent enough for the indie cult. This is good, pretty fun and cacthy music, but it doesnt really pull the whole intelligence act too well."
4,"This, most probably, is it.","Right place right time or wrong place wrong time? The Strokes stepped onto the world stage at the center of such a large amount of dubious hype that it's still uncertain whether the band will be able to survive it. ""Is This It"" offers some evidence on the positive side, however. The trick the Strokes have perfected - and it's an impressive trick - is to evoke every great 70's New York band while actually sounding like none of them. Julian Casablancas' vocals are a charismatic upgrading of Lou Reed at his most tuneful; the guitars mix Television's ethereality with the Feelies' strum'n'chop; the rhythm section motors along like they were the CBGB's house band. Every note on the album is played at the service of the songs, which are all of a uniformly high quality. Their second album will inevitably be released to mainstream disappointment, but I've got a feeling the band wouldn't want it any other way."
2,No thanks,This C.D. is too old fashioned. To many relaxed beats. If you like slow 80's stuff then here is the excellent disk for you. I like the heavier stuff so I'm not very impressed buy this. But you have to give them credit for trying. Thats why I rated this 2 stars.
2,Over hyped,"For all the talk surrounding this band I must say that I was disappointed. I got the album based on Last Nite, a very good song. The rest, though, was merely a bunch of monotonous chord progressions and regurgitated riffs. The bass is excellent and really pushes the songs. Singing is okay. One bad thing is the lack of energy. It sounds as if they rolled out of bed and recorded this album. Not recommended."
3,"Gritty, nostalgic, simple--but mediocre","If you like their sound in the first song--well, all the songs sound the same, so you're in luck: that's it, kids. The singer's hipper-than-thou style can be just what the doc ordered, but it gets annoying; the lo-fi, (originally delightfully) uncomplicated post-grunge music isn't wearing well with time. In other words, this is a Kraft Mac-n-Cheez kind of album: delightfully reminiscent of your once-trendy red tennies, endless Atari battles, summer nights spent in a small town in the parking lot at Wal-Mart, but ultimately it doesn't sit that well in your stomach, being cheap and empty. Eventually, you grow up and move on to something with more substance. Or go back to the old favorites it reminded you of in the first place."
4,Raw and funny !!!,"I am a metal fan and I feel that it is kinda weird for me to like this band. But I really dig this album. It kinda kicks in at the right time while Punk is boring, Heavy metal is kinda dead-end, and Hip-hop is all about killing and sex. It is like a breath of fresh air. My 4-year old really loves the title track and he can sing along too !!!"
2,New Clothes For The Emperor...,"I was planning to write about my disappointment with this album, when measured against the hype and the column inches lavished on this band. But Alex Cox on June 6th appears to have got there first and said it better.Underproduced, undertuned, overly-derivative. I only gave it two stars rather than one, because - despite the disillusionment - there are a couple of songs that almost make worthwhile listening, and after all they're not N' Sync..."
5,Look...,"OK, I've gotten into too many 2:00 in the morning bar arguments over the Strokes not to interject something: The same people who complain that the Strokes are simply ripping off the Velvet Underground are generally the same people who think themselves all cool and indie because they dig Yo La Tengo. The thing is, Yo La rips off the VU as well, they just prefer ""Venus In Furs"" to ""Rock & Roll"". If you're going to call a rock band derivative that's fine, but it can't be considered a fault if they do it well. And the Strokes do what they do very well. I for one am ecstatic that a VU/Stooges/Television influenced band is on TRL, because I think it would be tragic if the youth of America grew up thinking that the width and breadth of rock consisted of bands like Hoobastank and Abandoned Pools. The horror... the horror...In closing, just buy the damn album. It's very good music."
5,Simply Beautiful,"The Strokes are one of my favorite bands. They keep it real with simple melodies and smooth groove rhythms, backing the humble, incisive lyrics of Julian Casablancas. If you're tired of the overproduced, pandering to the masses mold that encompases the vast majority of todays top 10 lists, give this one a try."
2,Take it or leave it? OH LEAVE IT PLEASE!,"Originality? Nope. Talent? Nope. Good lyrics that make you think or are at least are well thought out? Nope again. Strike three. This album's out. The Strokes had the audacity in the first place to act like an indie band, and they still act like it. Yeah they may look cool and act all mellow and have this ""we're not in it for the money"" attitude but they are most definitly the opposite. For starters, the lyrics are atrocious, and are quite possibly some of the worst scribbling any band has ever done. The melodies are nice and catchy (sometimes), but for the most part there is no attention grabbing tune that makes you think, ""Man, this rules!"" A huge letdown is what I'd call this album, as the way peopl are hyping it up. Listen to the Beatles, Velvet Underground, heck, listen to American Boychoir before you listen to this piece of [stuff]. Fake indie at it's most average. If that's attainable...."
3,Lukewarm - Are you sure the Stooges are gone?,"I really like the music, but I wish Iggy Pop still made music like this. He invented the sound and it bugs me that I have to listen to The Strokes album to get my fix of ""that classic Iggy and the Stooges sound"".Mabey I'm just getting too old, but I still love the artists that start the trends rather than the ones that just bring it to a younger audience.Another thing - I bet when concert ticket go on sale you can see Iggy for half the price that you would spend to see these wannabee's."
4,Buy the EP...It's better,"I picked up the Modern Age ep a few months ago and was blow away at the raw, hard rocking sound. I also had the opportunity to see the Strokes live a month or so ago and they were true to form with the EP. I just picked up the LP yesterday and was disappointed about the amount of polish the mixers put on the songs. Not to say that this lp is bad, it has some great songs, but it lacks the power of the ep.If you already have the LP and love it, but the ep and take it to the next level.If you're thinking about picking this up, buy the ep instead and save your money for the next release. Hopefully the record company will let The Strokes sound like they do live on that one. Raw, Powerful and Hard"
4,Remind me of this other band,"Okay, okay so we love the strokes. what's not to love? Anyone looking at this review won't waste their money buying this cd. It's good. And if you like this check out a band, as yet unheard of in the corporate world of music, My Regrets. Caught their show in Portland, OR (I know, who would of thought!) and they rocked. Awesome vocals from a lead singer who channels Iggy Pop and good drums, bass, and guitar. Not bad looking either. I digress. Love The Strokes? Love My Regrets. You can thank me later."
4,Fantastic,"I first heard of The Strokes after picking up a copy of the THE FACE. This band had had the Brits drooling over them for months. I downloaded some of their tracks, and fell in love with the song ""Last Nite"". Julian has such a fantastic voice, it sounds about ten years older then his real age (about 22?), and reminds me of Lou Reed. Granted, there is nothing new and mindblowing on this record, but the music is just plain GOOD.I am a True New Yorker now living in Scotland, and putting this record on reminds me of all the grit, rawness, and coolness I miss about the city. And I am proud to say I own a copy of the Euro version, which has a much sexier cover!"
3,Iblue151 doesn't know anything about music,"I'm not arguing that the strokes aren't good, I myself am A fan. Although your misconception that they are trying to play some new kind of rock music is completely ridiculous. All the Strokes are doing is recycling the sound of the pre-punk bads like the Velvet Underground. This type of music has been done a million times before, it just so happens that the Stokes happen to be easy on the eye, thus propelling them into rock stardom along with bands like The Hives who borrow from bands like the Stooges and the Sonics. All music is recycled in one way or another and the Strokes just happen to be one of the hundreds of bands out their doing just that. Next time you try to influence people to listen to something, lblue151, try knowing what your talking about"
2,Awesome Album; cracked CD case,The album is great. The product from Amazon came with a crack in the case - not impressed.
2,I want to like it but............,"Maybe Im being unfair. This cd just doesnt do anything for me. Ive had it about six months now, and it just wont grab me enough to stay in my 5 disc player. Is it cause all the songs sound the same? I dont know. I got into the Vines cd more than this. (The Strokes are often compared to them). Maybe in a year or so Ill get what I seem to be missing now, but as for now, this one is on the back burner."
3,"Decent music, but overrated and too short","Is This It is a respectable album, but it has too many short comings to make it good. First the album is SHORT. We're talking 35 minutes here. And it's even shorter when you consider that only the first 9 songs are any good. Most of the songs on the album drone on and they all sound too familiar for me.The next major weakness of this album is that it sounds like The Strokes recorded it in a tin can. Seriously, the audio quality on this album is horrible. The bad sound effect works to a great effect on some of the songs. After a while, though, I can't handle it anymore. I have to turn the album off or develop a massive headache.On the other hand, the music, for the most part, is very good. When The Strokes are on, their music is great. It's just that too much of this album sounds the same and never really shows the full potential of The Strokes."
1,Uninspired (but I was suckered by the hype),"I don't usually read Spin Magazine, but I found a copy in the laundromat and gave it a gander as my clothes were drying. There was a short piece about ""The future of rock and roll,"" as embodied in this band from New York. I was intrigued, since the writer described them as something orginal and great.... But I should have known better (instead, I bought the CD). This music is completely recycled and devoid of anything creative, daring, original or even pleasurable to listen to. After just a day of listening to it, disgusted with my purchase, my girlfriend suggested I give it a few more listens. Problem was, I had a headache all next day because these extremely annoying Strokes songs kept rattling around in my head (like a bad commercial jingle).If this is the future of rock and roll then God help us, we're in for a truly boring and superficial tomorrow."
3,Good,"Yes they are over-hyped, sure I can see how some people might consider them boring but god, some of these loser one star reviews are making me so angry. I listen to the strokes as well as jimi hendrix and led zeppelin and while the last two are obviously better, more original, blah blah blah and most of the people who are recommending other bands have good suggestions if you're going to tell people to listen to led zeppelin (which is a good suggestion) please at least spell the band's name right. And has anyone else seen the review from the person who write ""The Strokes is the worst band since The Beatles."" ?? I can't even respond that comment, it's depressing."
5,"After this cd, how could you listen to anything else?","I started listening to the Strokes in January. I finally got the cd Is This It in februrary, and I listen to it every single day. I love it so much. Anyone out there who loves bands like the Ramones and the Velvet Underground (my other two favorite bands) really need to check this cd out. I don't have words to describe how I feel about this cd. The Strokes are a wonderful band. People, if you don't like this cd, you must be out of your everloving mind. And for those of you who think there is an ""Overhype"" about the Strokes, or you think that Julian's voice get tiring after a while, you might as well be listening to Britney Spears or something, because the Strokes are one of the most original and extrodinary bands to date! So BUY THIS CD!"
4,Not the saviors of rock - but not bad either.,The Strokes certainly do bring back memories of late 70's rock/punk. The riffs are catchy and melodic. The songs are very simliar to one another. Almost too similar as they flow into one another...it's like you've heard one long song after listening to the album. Last Nite is a good song with an equally good 70's-esque video.If you want to listen to something better - but somewhat akin to the Strokes - check out Marquee Moon by Television.
3,"Put Down That Goddamn Megaphone, You Doofus","The good news about The Strokes album is that they have a catchy-yet-droning feel, sort of a hideous mutation of the genes of Lou Reed and Harry Connick, Jr., and they don't waste time on guitar solos and similar muck.The bad news is that on about half these rather interchangeable numbers The Strokes start to sound as if they take themselves seriously, which is a fatal flaw in a group that probably sounds best when there's a quarter-inch of keg beer on the linoleum.And why do the vocals sound as if the microphone is fried?Buy it anyway. It's still a thousand times better than the latest splompff from the Goateed Fop du Jour."
4,Didn't hear about this album till I found it on Amazon.,"I didn't experience most of the hype around The Strokes. I didn't know who they were till about a month ago, and I'd only heard one song, Last Nite which I thought was alright. I decided to buy the album, and while it's not the greatest thing ever, in my opinion, it's probably one of the better rock albums to come out in the last two years. Sure there are a lot of other bands that might be better, but this is still a good album(it's GREAT when compared to all that other [junk] out there like Puddle of Mudd, Nickelback, Adema, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, etc.)If you're interested in buying an album that simply sounds good, then buy this cd. It's got some good catchy toons, and is more musical than most of that other stuff(I'd say [junk]) your hearing today that's said to be rock."
5,Pay Extra for the Import,"I admit that I jumped on the Stroke-wagon a little late but I'm glad I climbed aboard. I really appreciate albums without filler. ""Is This It"" is just that, strong all that way through. The walking basslines of the title track mesh perfectly with Julian's vocals. The beginning of ""Last Night"" will remind you immediatley of ""American Girl"" by Tom Petty but comes into it's own after the first few bars. Throwing down a few more ducats gets you the original album artwork which was banned in the US (the whole situation is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's ""Smell the Glove"", STRANGE), and the song ""NYC Cops"", which was left off the US release after the WTC 9/11. This song is the most ""punk"" on the CD. Aside from the multitude of 70s band comparisons (Television), if you like good, bar band rock this IS it."
5,A Great Album,"Say what you will about this album and this band, but I like them both. The Strokes have already begun a revolution back towards garage based guitar rock. ...bands like Nickleback, Limp Bizkit and Creed may have forever soured the taste of rock n roll, but hopefully bands like the strokes can bring it back to where it needs to be. Every so often, a band is labeled as the one ""who will save rock."" It's been quite a while since Nirvana got us out of that nightmare of a hangover called ""the eighties,"" and ten years later, the strokes seem willing and prepared to save music. This album may be somewhat derivative, but in rock n roll it doesn't matter if you steal, only who you steal from."
5,Oh PPPPPlease,"While the American version is missing the great ""New York City Cops"" (for obvious reasons) that particular version of the album is still worthy of at least four stars. I've heard the hype and I've heard the detractors....They make fun, simple, and intense songs that you can tell they feel passionate about making. It's homage music and for the unintiated (most of us, you hear that you art-punk elitists), it's something that sounds new. This album (like the Strokes are) is fun, it's underproduced, and it's in your face. Whether today's rock fans like it or not (I LOVE IT IN CASE YOU CRETIN DETRACTORS COULDN'T TELL) pop-rock is changing from the Bizkits and the Creeds of yesterday to this. ...Just sit back and rock out to just about every song on this superior UK edition because I give this muffin [arse] of an album 4 1/2 stars rated as 5..."
4,How Can Something So Terrible Be So Terribly Good?,"Musicianship of The Strokes: 1/5Lyrics: 2/5Production: 2/5Pop Melodies: PRICELESSLet's face it The Strokes are not terribly talented with their instruments. No innovation here. Every song sounds virtually the same. It seems as though their guitar players knows 3 and a half or four chords. The lyrics are typical pop drivel. And I hate how the lead singer's voice is distorted on the entire album (to make him sound older?).So why can I not stop listening to it?The melodies are catchy . . . I often underestimate how catchy. I bought the album for ""Last Night,"" and just assumed the rest of the album was filler material. I listened to it anyway and vowed never to listen to it again. I did that daily for a couple weeks before finally grudgingly admitting to myself that it must be good. There is something highly addictive in this music that can not be analyzed, it can only be enjoyed."
3,"Close, but no cigar","This CD is good, but not as good as the media would lead you to believe. There is nothing new here, especially those familiar with the late 70's. In a time when manufacturered souless bands are all the rage this CD does stand out, but just isn't a classic."
2,"""This is it"" ain't it","It's ludicrus for anyone to compare The Strokes to Radiohead. They're completely different sounds. Radiohead is made up of major league musicians and Thom Yorke is a brilliant vocalist and writer, while The Strokes sound like every other wannabe Velvet Underground band I see every weekend in NYC. I'd rather listen to Television's Marquee Moon, it's the same sound but with better guitarists."
2,"If you've never heard Lou Reed before, you might buy it.","But I don't. It kind of reminds me when Lenny Kravitz came out with Let Love Rule. If you'd never heard John Lennon or the Beatles before, you might think it was a good record. Well, perhaps enough time has passed that a new generation, unfamiliar with Velvet Underground and what they meant to modern rock'n'roll, will hear this record for the first time and think ""how innovative!"" Though their impression of V.U. is quite good, I nevertheless would like to hear what the Strokes themselves actually sound like."
2,Don't believe the hype,"This is a great example of style over substance. The Strokes can pose, sneer and act snotty. They have hip clothes and great rock-n-roll hair. The have a sack full of great reviews. The one thing missing is.....TALENT. They just can't play. Their songs aren't particularly interesting in structure, theme or melody. Their chops are terrible. Yet, some influential music spin-doctor has labled this ""minimalist"" in an attempt to justify their lack of proficiency in playing and songwriting. The only reason they SEEM interesting is the background of boy-band garbage and bubble-gum pop against which they are juxtaposed. As a guitar player for the last 20 years, I love all types of guitar driven music-rock, pop, metal, punk, jazz- whatever. For me, however, the Strokes come up lacking."
3,"Good, but no big deal","Any band that is touted in the press as the second coming of rock and roll is inevitably going to end up suffering a backlash. Don't listen to the extremists at either end. The Strokes are neither great nor terrible. Rather, they're simply a good band with pretty decent songs. If you like stripped down, unpretentious rock and roll, you should like them. Sure, they may be rich, uptown pretty boys with fashion industry connections, but who cares? It seems to me that what matters is what comes out of my speakers when I play the CD. It's no exaggeration to say that Julian Casablancas's vocals are nearly identical to Lou Reed in his Velvet Underground years, but they aren't VU clones. The Strokes are generally a bit more tuneful if nowhere near as original and inspired as the Velvets were."
2,Not quite yet...,"Really, these guys are still only getting their feet wet. It is far too early to claim The Strokes to be very much of anything, at least until they release their next full-length album and then see where it goes. I can't really say I like this band per say, because we all know that it has been done before with far better results. One of the major problems I have with this band is that their is no real creative edge to what they do, and their music by no means packs a punch. So is this some sort of new variation of Rock 'N' Roll music that actually doesn't rock??? It also amazes me that groups like The White Stripes and The Strokes have gotten so much media hype within the last year or so, and yet the great freak-out rockin' music of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion has yet to receive its due. Anyhow, as far as The Strokes go...there's just gotta be someone pulling the strings behind the scenes."
4,Needed and enjoyable.,"Rock needed a little mainstream boost of interesting music. Everything had become kind of whinny. It was cool to just turn the music loud and enjoy it again, without it being a tougher album or group to find. You should know, there are two versions. One with NYC Cops, and one without it, because they pulled the song for a while after 9/11. An overraction, since the song is not an attack on cops or NYC. But it happened. I think it's on each one now. Either way, check the track listing or whatever. Great record, great band. And they keep making good music with each new record."
5,This IS real rock!!! These guys have it!!!,"Finally, a talented rock band that really plays ROCK, and not the rap-rock no-talent garbage that has permeated our culture! This is 'shoot from the hip' big fashion city rock that is raw, fresh, talented, and sorely needed today! I am 40 years old, and have experienced and lived through rock in the late 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's, and can tell you that 'The Strokes' are going places fast. They have balls, talent, great hooks, and great looks! What more could you want, really???"
4,The real question.,"The Strokes are a mix of old Stereolab, old Wire, old VU, old Stooges, and (a bit of) old Television---combined quite well and with flair. It's not anything groundbreaking or brand-new, by any means. But if you love the above-mentioned bands, as I do, it'll be extremely hard to resist the charms of this CD. One can play spot-the-influence all day long, but the real question is: Does this stuff, well, rock? Yup, it sure does. Dig it."
4,The Strokes make irresistible New York rock,"The Strokes are just plain fun, and British Press Releases that claim them to be a great band are wrong. The Strokes are way better than that, and their authenticity hydroplanes through dark alleys of sellouts, posers, and ""seemingly fresh music."" But the Strokes may be some of the only fresh alternative of 2001. Despite Weezer's geek-rock triumph, Tool's clatter and clang rock-opus, and Pete Yorn's telling soliliquy festival, The Strokes hearty brand of New York rock is a reaper to its competition. If the first single ""Last Nite"" doesn't have you in an all-out tap session, then stellar trip-hops like ""Barely Legal"" will. The Strokes are unavoidable, irresistible, New York rockers with a sound sure to get the party started."
2,Deception,"I heard a lot of good things about this album. Honestly, I'm very disappointed: it's bland, boring, lacks energy.I wouldn't recommend this album if you want to hear ""something different"" in the current rock'n'roll production. Go check White Stripes instead: garage sound, tons of tunes, amazing stuff."
1,If this is the future of rock and roll... it's over.,"This CD is nothing more than the whiny ramblings of a spoiled little...rich boy turned ""rocker"". None of the songs on this album capture any sort of passion or groove. And what is their feigned anger about- the high price of CD's? They have nothing to say! The lead singer is mediocre, can't play any instruments, the songwritng mundane, predictable... Kate Moss and her starving model buddies might have been stupid enough to fall for all of the hype around this band but noone serious about good music will. Everytime a band is declared the savior of rock and roll they soon die. It's the same as trying to compare a lame band to The Beatles (i.e. New Kids On the Block, Oasis, Hanson- they all [stink] and have no longevity). This album is garbage. You're better off buying Gary Glitter's Greatest Hits."
4,A new band off to a good start.,"I first became aware of The Strokes when a friend from work recommended them to me.He had heard some of their music from singles that were released before their first album came out.When I heard ""Last Nite"" for myself, I decided to purchase the album.I liked it from the start. This was 70's influenced rock and roll done well. Clearly taking their inspiration from the The Clash and Television, The Strokes put on their own mark on that type of music.""The Modern Age"", ""Soma"", ""Barely Legal"", ""Take It or Leave It"", they all sounded great. I play this album all the way through without skipping any tracks. My big complaint, however, is that the some of the vocals seem to be muffled on purpose, for some reason.It isn't really necessary, they don't need to do it. Aside from that, I really enjoyed ""Is This It?""."
4,this is it!,"Hype or not, this is fun music. Among the newest artists around these guys clearly stand out. Coldplay is in a class by themselves, but if you're looking for music besides rehashed metal rap crap or teen angst boredom or commercial puff britney, this stuff beats all the others. Different new fresh and interesting, don't waste your time with other crap, check out something new. Haven't bought a new release in quite some time, this one was worth it."
2,A little disappointing,"I must admit that I found this album a little disappointing. It isn't bad, but it lacks that certain something, that sets great bands apart from the rest. There are two good songs on the album, but it is let down by the quality of the vocalist, who reminds me of Iggy Pop. Their guitar-orientated sound also sounds a bit derivative. I guess if I were top recommend some alternatives they would be: Travis, Radiohead and The White Stripes. All of whom have that spark, which the Strokes don't seem to have. For the saviors of Rock and Roll I would look elsewhere."
1,Don't believe the hype,"What do you get when you take a style of music that's been played for years by NY bands, and put it in the hands of a bunch of heavily connected European-boarding-school-bred Manhattan elitist snobs? The next big thing!! Pop history!! Stop being suckers everyone.The Strokes aren't the worst thing I've ever heard, but they sure as hell aren't going to change the face of music. Make the rich richer sheep!!!"
2,Lacking passion and emotion.,"The Strokes are all hype and style with no substance. It certainly helps when each of the members of the group have the advantage of an instant cash machine to feed the public relations machine thereby building the hype. The critical acclaim heaped on the this group is not warranted. The songs are weak and limp. None of the songs exude any passion, emotion or feeling. Don't buy into the hype. Do not buy this disc until you have heard it in its entirety first. Do not buy it based on its critical reviews."
3,It's not easy being original...,"And the Strokes made that obvious. They sound just like their inspirations only with less heart. Not worth the hype they recieved although the album is really good, it's just someone else's work."
2,?,"I purchased this vinyl a few days ago and when i got it in the mail the album was already warped. This should'nt have happened, and i dont think ill be buying from amazon directly again. I was told It would be ""frustration free""..."
2,Really good cd till about the third song,"I have to admit I heard allot of hype about this Cd so I bought it the day it came out. Track one wasn't an entirely ""NEW SOUND"", however I really like it I even was kind of bobbing mi head. Song 2 was not bad but not as good as the first..... Same guitar/singing effect (odd?) anyway...Song 3...A bad version of song 2...you getting the picture.... The strokes are like some guy telling you a really funny joke 11 different was..after the the second time you catch on. Bottom like get the title track on mp3 don't waste your money. If this band varied and played different cords n didn't use that same distorted sound effect in every damn song they would truly live up to the hype."
1,wrong album inside of case,"I was pumped to receive this album on vinyl. When it came, a Kings of Leon vinyl was inside the Strokes case. I can't think of a worse band to be inside to surprise me. Either way, I got the wrong record, which sucks because is this it is amazing."
1,this sucks,"one chords sections for minutes... boring vocals, boring beats, no talented musicians playing what might be the most boring music ever made. Sorry but this is definitely not worth your dollar. So what's all the buzz about? They are different, but that doesn't mean better, in this case it means worse. Sorry but I really didn't like this record.Highlights: nothingLowlights: the boring riffs."
1,this is a perfect example of hype!,"people,this album blows, and I mean it really sucks. they're not even good enough to be a garage band. the only 2 reasons they're so hyped is: 1. rolling stone magazine is pushing them as the next U2 and 2. they're good looking young dudes. easy to sell to a marketing driven public.honestly, there is nothing good about this record or this band. even their big hit "" last night"" , has to steal a riff from tom petty's 'american girl"". could you get any lamer than stealing from tom effing petty?try any VU album, also the new remaster of Television's marquee moon. anything but this pile of crap!honestly people, are we so desparate?this really is a case of the emperor's new clothes.YUCK!"
5,Fantastic,"Great CD from start to finish. Tons of energy, great song writing and great musicianship, what more can you ask for. Perhaps the best album of 2001."
3,"Cool, don't get me wrong, but could be more diverse...","This is a great album, don't get me wrong- it just could've been done with a bit more variety in mind... I mean, the formula's very cool. However, that's it's problem- it relies too much on that one formula, and becomes sort of one-dimensional. But, hey, if you have a little extra cash on ya, pick this one up. It can be good from time to time. BTW, even for the lack of electicism, the bassist is *extremely* tasteful."
4,New York Punk lives!,"If you wondered what would happen if Iggy Pop and Joey Ramone had a child all you have to do is listen to this album. The Strokes are raw even though they have the catchy melodies, this is what we like. It's the huge sound of Nirvana; it is the low fi rock that you hear from many horribly lit and sparcely populated clubs in the bad section of town. Of course I could be wrong; it's possible they spent big bucks to get this ""low Production"" sound. The album has at least one big time radio freind in "" LAst Night ""."
3,Whatever happened to Urge Overkill?,"Not a bad album, certainly. At least it's rock and roll. A lot of other good bands have been accused of ripping off VU. I remember about 8 years ago, there was this band called Urge Overkill, hyped out the wazoo, put out an album called Saturation, then promptly disappeared (somebody had a drug problem, as I recall). Saturation was 10 times the album this is."
3,amazingly average,"if this is the phoenix-like return of rock, I can only wonder why. the first two songs are excellent, especially the lou-reed rip-off second song (they've got him down pat), but after that it's decent rock with annoyingly fuzzy vocals. Granted the dude doesn't have a great voice, but fuzzing it to the point of pain just makes it worse. not bad, but not great either. how ironic is the title?"
1,lift the cover off your eyes,these guys are as made up and put together as the latest boy-bandnuf said..
2,"They really, really want to be Television (or maybe VU)","I just can't say that I liked this very much. They are just not original at all. If this record had been released twenty five years ago, then it probably would have been great, but this has all been done before and usually much better. The songs when viewed strictly on there own merits aren't bad, but there is a certain monotony to this album that really wears on my nerves after a while. The singer's voice never variates from the same tone, and he seems to show absoluteley no emotion in any of the songs. It also seems like the guitarist plays the same riffs on every song. So, in conclusion, if you are thinking of buying this album, do yourself a favor and buy ""White Light/ White Heat"" or ""Marquee Moon"" first."
1,By the numbers,"I won a copy of this disc in a contest, and I'm sure glad I didn't spend money on it! This is about as dull and uninspired as music gets; it's just by-the-numbers grunge pop lacking in originality and substance. Lyrics, songwriting, and musicianship are all thoroughly forgettable, as I'm sure this band will be forgotten as soon as their flavour-of-the-month appeal wears off. Avoid at all costs."
3,"Much hype, little substance.","The Strokes are one of those bands I love to hate. Overall the album is not bad. Its got catchy tunes, and their image is fully intact throughout. But thats just it. They don't create their image on this album, its almost as if their album was produced simply to protect their image.They don't take any chances, they stick to the formula, it all seems a little calculated. It was less than what I felt they made themselves out to be. I don't hate the strokes by any means, but it all seems a little dry and juvenile."
5,"It's the Song, not the Singer","It doesn't matter who the Strokes are. Rich kids? Just about every star winds up rich, and I don't think this discredits their music any more than the personal wealth of the Strokes' members does. The fact is that the Strokes' album IS one of the best rock albums released last year, and is hands-down the best MAINSTREAM rock album put out in a long time. The reason the Strokes will save rock is because their label will push them out from the deep crevices where other so-called ""genuine"" rock acts crawl to tan or burn under your capricious gaze (and honestly, some of these guys could use a tan). So to all those wearing rock t-shirts from unknown bands to ""prove you were there and heard of them first"", just admit that the music on Is This It is fantastic and you just don't like anything that plays on non-college radio. If you want a great album, click and buy the Strokes. If you want to pose about musical knowledge, go buy some vinyl and just shut up."
3,Overhyped and Definitely Not the Savior of Rock n Roll,"What a disappointment this album turned out to be. Everyone and every article seemed to hype this album and group as the next best thing to come out of NYC's music scene. As soon as I heard the first few tracks, I thought that Paul Westerberg and the Replacements should be suing the pants off these guys. Anyone that says the Strokes have an original, fresh approach or some buzz phrase like that surely haven't been listening to music long enough."
3,Rock Saviors? Hmm well...,"The strokes make a genuine effort to find that sound, create some angst, and look good doing it. The Strokes lead singer does a very good Iggy, I love that disintrested sick of it all thing he's got going. But there is too much of the same sameness in the record, and some of the songs are too long. I'll put this one away soon, if you wanna rock out to a non vintage rock band, listen to the White Stripes."
2,This is supposed to save rock and roll???,"The music is simple basic pop that has been done a million times. If you enjoy overplayed, mundane music then this may be just the disc for you. I would rather buy material from the bands that wrote this music 20 years ago."
1,Message to the Brainwashed Masses: This is NOT music,"""Album of the Year 2001?"" And Amazon reviewers are still claiming this album ""saved rock"" 4 years later?? Ha! This is the effect of marketing to the masses by corporate propoganda in financially-connected publications of nepitism! Appreciating quality music is not something a poser can buy and wear by quickly hearing a few tidbits from the hype-mill and making a trip to the local suburban mall. Listen to the music, don't wear it on your sleave like a fashion statement.All copies of this CD should be hammered into microscopic bits and recycled into gallon milk jugs."
1,Terrible disc,"I bought this cd thinking it would be an easy listener, with a lot of good songs. I ended up selling it the next day for ten less than i bought it for. Only two songs are even worth the two and a half minutes of my amazingly lazy and boring life (Someday, Last Nite). The Strokes couldn't carry a tune with a truck. Do not buy this cd!"
1,What's the point?,"I admit to have never been a Velvet Underground fan, so when I realized after two tracks that this CD was basically nothing more than a Velvet tribute album assembled by a single band I sold it quick.>I do believe that it's possible to pay tribute to one's musical inspiration without becoming nothing more than a knock-off of the original; the Dandy Warhols even succeeded in a Velvet Underground tribute on their debut with ""(This Song Is Called) Lou Weed"" without compromising their own identity.>But the bottom line is if you are a Velvet Underground fan, why would you not choose to listen to the Velvet Underground instead of these wanna-be's? ""Is This It?"", indeed."
3,Pretty good...,"While this is a pretty good catchy album, it seems to rely to far upon Julian's charisma. The sounds are all similar three minutes songs with Lou Reed. I still think that it was so sucessful due to the fact there is nothing better. It's almost a novelity. Overall, this is a pleasant album that really doesn't seem very solid. While I like hearing 11 versions of the same nice song, it still leaves me with a bit of a feeling of ""Is This It"" after not quite having them live up to my expectations."
1,More hype than talent,"This is one of the most appropriately titled CDs in recent years. After reading so many glowing reviews of this disc and being buried in the media onslaught declaring The Strokes the next great rock n roll band, I was expecting something darned impressive when I slapped this on. What I got was warmed over Stooges, Velvet Underground and Television, played with precision and absolutely no heart. This isn't a rock band--it's a cruise ship act, suitable for cabarets and weddings. These boys should be playing VU covers for happy seniors. The only thing less impressive and more transparently calculated than this disc is The Strokes' stage presence. Man, they must love watching themselves on video--""Did you see that? I have Iggy's old hair and I look so CUTE!"""
2,Meh.,"It truly isn't the derritiveness that irks me, it is the blatant desire to put style over substance. It's impossible to ignore the fact that this combination has been done several time and done better but as a pure enjoyability and longevity standard, this album ranks low.Even if the album were under the most suited production, it'd rank low. Their youth could possibly be a deciding factor in this. The low-budgetness of the album does not serve as a support to the album. The low budget only allows their flaws to be held out cleanly.The thing instantly held to mind is lukewarm. Half done riffs, half done passion in the vocal and lukewarm response.This is reccommended to anybody who has the money to blow, maybe. But anybody looking for pure passion, innovatation or whatever else has been slagged on to this band can find it elsewhere."
1,caution: copy protected,My copy of this disc was copy protected and wouldn't play on my high end player nor was I able to use my computer to play it or rip it (which is legally protected fair use).
3,Don't get the comparisons,"I don't get the Television or Stooges. The Strokes are pretty good, but they lack the artful elegance of Television and the genuine rawness of the Stooges. They sound more like a version of Blonde Redhead which has been dressed up in its Sunday clothes, and since B.H. can be seen as a descendant of Sonic Youth, descending from Glenn Branca, descending from . . . it's endless. Regardless, the Television and Stooges comps. are off-base. Again, I like this album, but don't bother trying to claim they're 1/3 Spaceman 3 + 1/3 the Slits + 1/3 Plastic Bertrand (which I wouldn't suggest attempting in front of anyone who's every listened to more than 10 bands); instead, just realize that the Strokes have borrowed alot, injected some ethusiasm, and put out a pleasant listen. (Spending too much time comparing them to other bands really only displays different listeners' levels of musical ignorance)"
1,"I'm Sorry, but this is just terrible.","I listened to this album all the way through nearly five times. I tried to understand what all the commotion was about, alas I couldnt find anything other than [terrible] songs. This album is absolutely pathetic. I think that every one is just jumping on the bandwagon in an attempt to be hip. This is just sad. The saviors of rock are Iced Earth. not these clowns."
1,it takes five guys to make this ?,somebody wake up the second guitarist. this kind of thing was done waaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better 30 years ago. would it hurt to have a chours once and a while?
1,one cool thing,"This album is a collection of mediocre songs played poorly. But then I saw the video, and aside from his super-hip hyper-cool attitude, what got me was the singer's plastic over-18 bar bracelets. That's dripping with cool, to be sure. So I had to up my rating to one star. Just keepin' it real."
1,is this it????????????? not exactlly,"a question i have been asking myself ever since i have heard the the name this band mentioned on every magazine cover and review out there.well the answer of course is NO!!!!they will probably out live all there influences such as television,iggy pop,and of course lou reed,.why because every one still buys into the hype of these kinds of albums.this album is as typical as any album thats was put together buy some garage band that borrows from all there influences and has no originality at all.just retro in its finest hour.so to sum it up if you werent there the first time around for lets say the velvet underground.here is your chance to hear the 4th generation watererd down version of the band .just wait until you can buy this in the 99 cent section of the used record store then it might be it........."
1,It sounds they had a stroke,"With all the recent reviews and hype over these ""new saviors of rock-n-roll""'s album, I was anxiously awaiting its release to the local record stores. Maybe my interpretation of rock-n-roll is different than others. Maybe when I hear that this band plays rock-n-roll, I'm thinking the Stones, Ramones, Replacements, Zeppelin, Social D.,etc. The Strokes have the energy and enthusiasm of a stroke victim. The only song I can even remember is track seven, which rips off the beginning of ""American Girl"". The whining muffed vocals and the mundane guitar playing blur without distinction from song to song, in a vain attempt to hide the lack of talent. They must have done so real ...up or sold their soul to the devil to get signed. If these guys are the future of rock, we are all ...."
3,The emperors new album,"I am probably the only person who loves the Velvet Underground and Television that is going to say this, but I must.I bought the album based upon the buzz and was looking forward to something special. It is a good album, but by no means IS THIS IT. This album is repetitive, the production quality fuzzes out the lead singer to the point of obscurity, but the band is tight and the guitar hooks are very interesting.The Strokes are an up and coming item and I look forward to hearing more from them but by no means are they Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground aside from being art rockers from NYU and NYC.Feel free to form your own opinions though."
5,depressingcoolbeautiful,"I don't care about where the strokes came from or why they are making their music. I just know it sounds great. Casablancas has a absolutely great voice, and one or both of their guitar players rips out some great, albeit short, solos. Everything about them is old-style, but who cares? They can whoop on most new metal or punk band out there. Not all metal and punk, I have serious respect for black sabbath, marilyn manson, and the ramones, among others. The strokes are awesome, no matter what the 1 star people say."
4,Different Strokes for different folks,"With the virtual rebirth of instant indie super-stardom, you could bet this NY retro-chic rock debut was heavily debated on quality from the get go. The tinny hipster production can wear thin, but often catches the band in striking reach when melodics flow properly, which they usually do, deceptively underneath calculatedly fuzzed-out aesthetics."
3,Don't go looking for sudden enlightenment...,"This record came to me in the mail by surprise so I had no expectations when I popped it in the changer.Listened all the way through and let it cycle about five times before I had to turn it off.It's not great headphone music but it's great for grooving around the house or in the car. Honest indie rock, highly listenable."
4,Straight to the Point,"History has shown that you can always count on a group of New York art fags to breathe new life into the music scene. In the tradition of such great NY art fag bands as The Velvet Underground and Television, The Strokes have created a sound that is straight to the point. On ""Is This It?"", The Strokes stick to that stripped down ""punk"" aesthetic: Not overly-produced or full of itselt. This album is as good as it is because the songs are well composed and performed...That's all you can ask."
5,Album Of The Year,"It's extremely rare to have an album live up to its hype in this day and age. That being said, I can hardly describe my joy upon hearing Is This It. It doesn't matter that Julian Casablancas' voice sounds like Lou Reed or that his lyrics recall the New-York-been-there-seen-it-done-that world weariness of Reed and Tom Verlaine. Or that the guitars at times echo the stark minimalism of Television. Or that the rhythms recall the jubilant bounciness of 80's new wavers such as the Smiths and the Psychedelic Furs.All you need to know is that this is an album for blasting in your car stereo. An album for dancing around your living room by yourself. An album of yesterday, today and tomorrow. This is it."
1,READ THIS,"One of my best friends is an all out strokes fan and there a band that I really didnt listen to till they got bigger...but i was very dissapointed. He told me about there amazing talent and all that good stuff, so I listened to it full of antisipation, only to be dissapointed to the 3rd degree. Maybe it was an overload of bands such as THE vines THE strokes THE hives THE white stripes THE ataris....so many the's i feel like i dropped back 30 years into hell...maybe its just that i'm an all out sum 41 fan, unwritten law and of course SR-71!!just a different style but this was just dissapointing to hear it be claimed the future of rock n role...god have mercy"
5,Could it be better than the hype?,"When you first listen, the guitar sonics scream Television and Julian Casablancas (vocalist) sounds like Lou Reed. Soon after the Strokes become their own with the urgency and hooks only the best rock bands find. Many listens later (four times one day), ""Is this it?"" stands as an important statement to compelling attitude and creativity among today's abundance of created music. It's energy doesn't wear off and Casablancas' unique vocal phrasings leave you wondering if the Strokes aren't the best band since Nirvana."
4,"So there is a lot of hype surrounding, so what?","OK, I'm tired of hearing people bitching about the Strokes because there is a lot of hype surrounding them. Who cares if they sound the like the other 'the' bands (which I personally think they don't; actually not even close) and played on MTV (which I do not watch btw). It seems like you hate them because they are popular though and that's just wrong. Maybe if you actually listened to the CD with an open mind and judge it for what it is, not who they sound like or how much hype is surrounding them. It may not be groundbreaking at all, but it is fun, ""feel-good"" music, and is meant to be enjoyed not judged. Don't be such snobs."
5,One Of The Greatest Albums Ever Made,"The Strokes Really Hit Big With Their First Album , Is This It.In Reality This Is It. from Beggining Till End, Nothing But Amazing Tracks Like ""Is this It"" , ""Someday"" , ""Last Nite"" , ""Hard to Explain"" & ""When It Started"" Reminds A Person Of Their Everyday Life Reminiscing Their Past Of Good Times And Bad Times , It Also Reminds Of Your Adolecence. Those Songs Challenge The Work Of The Greatest Beach Boys Album: ""The Pet Sounds"". While The Other Title Track Such As ""The Modern Age"" ,""Soma"",""Barely Legal"", ""Alone Together"", ""Trying Your Luck"", ""Take It or Leave It"". Take The Music Of Rock To Another Level . It Also Reminds You During The Time Of Difficulties Of Life . Challenges The Work Of ""The Velvet Undergound & Nico"" Album. Rock Has Starded All Over Again With This Album.Long Live The Strokes..."
1,Ditto,"Reviewer: A music fan from Chicago, IL United StatesThis is POP music. This is not Rock & Roll ... nor are they the saviours of the american music scene -- that is a hard burden to carry by anyone. Truth -- They are rich kids. Truth -- their songs sound unoriginal compared let's say to the White Stripes, The Warlocks or even Vax Wallo. I am not a music snob -- I just call them like I see them.The american music scene is alive an well living in the underbelly of your cities. Detroit, Chicago, L.A., NY Austin, Seattle .. but please don't give mumbo jumbo about this band. The Strokes only accolade should be is that the true Musicians/artist will shine through the fog they emitted.""A sucker is born every minute"""
2,The Album Is A One Hit Wonder,"The rest of the album besides ""Last Night"" is totally forgetable. And ""Last Night"" isn't particularly inspiring - it's just fun to listen to - which is fine. Sometimes that's all music needs to be. Maybe they'll have another hit next year, but I doubt the rest of whatever they put out next time around will justify buying another ablum of theirs."
1,Eh.,"Another pop boy band, just with a different target demographic. It's really just business to create a straight 'rock' band to maximize profits, since it's an area of music that hasn't been concentrated on lately. It's simple business, and simple music. At the very least the Rolling Stones had some groove and feeling to their ambitions. This band is just too lifeless and dead to really take seriously. You can see the passion they feel for their music in their live preformances - a bunch of bodies collecting dust while they roll out whatever notes they were told to play. Hey, it's not a bad way to make money, but it's not art. There's better stuff out there right now as far as rock goes - check out Comets on Fire and other groups. Rock isn't dead, it's just not on MTV."
