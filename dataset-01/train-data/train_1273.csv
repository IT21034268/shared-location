4,Gratifying and Witty,"I do not normally write reviews, but on completion of this book I was inspired to relay the charm of this novel.This book explores notions as complex as business espionage, and emotion-based ideas spanning from personal development and achievement, to love. These plot twists are masked by the sweet and charming faade of chick lit.I found the novel to be a light-hearted and humorous escape from reality. I found myself to be immersed in Samantha Sweeting's fictional world, which I find to be quite surprising as my facination usually spans to fantasy novels exclusively.A great read, a charming heroine."
3,No tea for me please,"I really like Sophie Kinsella and my mom told me I had to read this book. Sadly this one was a bit of a miss for me. I had a hard time trying to get into it, and a lot of the things that happen to the main character are really stressful. I found myself in constant worry for how she would handle these situations all throughout the novel. There are a few funny and lighthearted parts, but overall I could only say I thought this book was OK. Certainly not my favorite of hers."
2,C,"Kinsella drops the ball on a novel that, in its last fifty pages, cannot sustain its own plot. With a promising premise and a quirky enough female protagonist, The Undomestic Goddess starts off as a vaguely amusing escapist adventure. Everything about the novel is average - the situations and humor are enough to keep a reader interested but unhappy at the conclusion. The sentiments are transparent and treacly, and the funny situations don't quite hit their mark. Kinsella's work is usually hilarious, but the book is soon lost to plot twists that become overwhelming, as they all occur in the final act. The awkward moments that are supposed to carry the novel are unnervingly contrived and absolutely unimaginable. A suspension of disbelief is unbelievably hard to procure. The romance is sweet and comfortingly moves along to its obvious finale. The entire text is a piece of cheap chocolate: soothing yet bland, fun while it lasts, but in the end, doesn't keep you satisfied."
2,Slightly disappointed,"This is my least favorite of all of Sophie Kinsella's books. It is VERY predictable, and as other reviewers have noted, leaves a lot of loose ends, like what happened to the Geigers? The author made it sound like there was something going on with them earlier, but that just dissolves.Also, this is the first male love interest out of all of Kinsella's books that I couldn't stand! I was surprised. I couldn't even picture what he looked like in my head, and actually didn't want them to end up together.It was also lacking in humor. I'd recommend it if you're a big fan of Kinsella's, but if not, don't bother picking it up."
4,Very much enjoyed,"I liked this book very much, but will not give it 5 stars because in my opinion it pales to Kinsellas wonderful Shopaholic books and the glorious Becky Bloomwood. I did think that this story was fun and cute and just what I was looking to read, once again Sophie Kinsella does not disappoint. I love her work."
4,A lot of fun!,"Well, this book was one of the three choices for our February book club book, and do I ever wish that we had chosen this one over _The Godmother_! Not that this was by any means a ""serious"" novel, no, it was a typical British Chick Lit sort of book - a little silly, and a lot of fun to read! There were definitely some laugh-out-loud parts to this, that made me wish that there was a movie-version to see with friends. The plot was at times a bit stressful, but overall it was just a lot of fun to read and made for a satisfying way to spend my evening."
1,Ridiculous,"Like some reviewers, I also read Can You Keep a Secret and enjoyed it. So I picked this up and was terribly disappointed. The story is just ridiculous! I know it's fiction, but good writers have the talent to make the reader BELIEVE the fiction they write...this book wasn't believable in any aspect. This high-powered, genius-IQ lawyer has NEVER ironed a shirt, or cooked a meal? And then she throws away her years of school and her job to be a housekeeper? Come ON! Why she wouldn't just tell this family she works for that it was all a misunderstanding from the very beginning just doesn't hold water.Another thing that bugged me was that it was written like a romantic comedy screenplay! The scene where Nathanial gets off the train and they're on opposite sides of the tracks...it was so clearly written like one of those sterotypical chick flick movies. So predictable and lame. Ick."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I am a huge fan of Sophie's Shopaholic series & ""Can You Keep a Secret"", but this one is a complete waste of good paper.Take Becky Bloomwood, remove the shopping addiction and just change her job description to that of ""lawyer"", and here you have the basis for the heroine of the novel Samantha Sweeten.The notion that a successful attorney wants to give up their career just because they are suffering from burnout and turns to housekeeping as an outlet is a bad one. It's even more irritating to read that even though she has the opportunity to take control of her life she never really does. The book would have ended far better if Samantha somehow managed to change her work environment to suit her needs better instead of just running away from it again."
2,Ugh...,"I really enjoyed the Shopaholic series, for the most part, so I was excited when I saw that Sophie Kinsella had another book out and hurried to purchase it in hardcover. However, I was really disapointed. While most chick lit books suffer from being predictable, this one was EXTREMELY predictable and just felt like it had no ""meat"" in the middle. To me the tone and voice of this book made it feel too similar to the Shopaholic series. Don't get me wrong, I love chick lit and don't take it too seriously, but I think other authors like Jane Green have done a better job at writing several books with a similar tone, but in different, unique voices. I like that Kinsella took on the character of a successful, headstrong woman, however I hated where it ended up."
3,Easy and funny,"This book was very funny, though not as humorous as the ""Shopaholic"" series. The main character Samantha though seems to be patterned after Beck from Shopaholic, smart and determined, but always ends up in a sticky situation. The book was very funny, but I was kind of hoping for more at the end. It was a very good summer read though!"
4,If you ever wanted to run away from work screaming,"...you would understand the story line of this book. It captures the life of a workaholic who only realizes she is one when her whole world comes crashing down on her. I don't think this has anything against driven career women but more on people becoming unaware that work consumes everything else in their lives. And that sometimes, what we think we want is not really what we want or need. It's not totally far-fetched. I've read about doctor who became a musician, another professional (I don't remember what) becoming a baker. I had fun reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a light summer read."
4,"Enjoyable, quick read!! Would recommend!","I love the author and have read all of her other books... she is funny and witty. This was an enjoyable, funny book."
4,FUN,"its like 4.5 bc it wasnt perfect..which is hard. looove this book ok at first (i love the author and ive read the shopaholic series and can you keep a secret) so at first i was not as happy..it started off a bit slow but i got so into it. wow ok its really funny and theres parts where the lines are hilarious..all kinsellas characters are! great, fun book!"
4,Undomestic Goddess,"This book was very cute. I've read the Shopaholic series and this was a nice change. I passed it on to my mom. Nice romance and funny plot. It's a good no-brainer, warm-fuzzy, curl-up-and-read-a-book book."
3,"Definitely a page turner, but becomes ridiculous in the end","Initially, I enjoyed reading The Undomestic Goddess. However, I began to get worried about the conclusion of the book when the climax (in my opinion) occurred 100 pages before the final ending. I feared then that the denouement and conclusion would be long, drawn out, and a bit ridiculous. As it turned out, my assumptions were correct. It felt as if the ending was out of a recipe book for a romantic comedy script. It seemed like she wrote it so that it could be converted into a movie. This made the ending very predictable and convoluted. Overall, I thought the book was OK, but I would have preferred a different ending."
3,A lovely bit of silly escapism,"This book is not meant to be a work of literature. It is a soap opera, with all the right ingredients. First the hilariously cliched characters: the workaholic lawyer, the nouvoux riche employers, the stud of a gardener. The sheer absurdity of the plot - a lawyer mistaken as a housekeeper, not even knowing how to turn on the stove! And on it goes. It's like Gosford Park meets the Bold and the Beautiful. I bought this book as airport reading and that's exactly what it is. Light and funny. I read it in a day and loved it for what it is."
4,I laughed out loud in the dentist office!,"I was reading this book while waiting for my son's braces to be adjusted, and I laughed out loud in the very first chapter, when she is at a spa and she has smuggled in her BlackBerry and her cell phone! It is a wonderful, lighthearted read."
5,Couldn't Stop Laughing,"This book was so much fun. Face it, if you are going to read something like this you should go into it knowing that it is not going to win any literary awards. After accepting that fact sit back and let yourself have a great time reading this book.The book pokes fun of lawyers who are overworked and over obsessed with their jobs. The main character is a delight and the story is filled with sections that were very funny.This is a perfect vacation book. Chic lit at it's best."
4,From a lawyer ...,I loved this book. There were parts of it especially the references to long hours etc that as a banking lawyer I could definately relate to even if parts of the story were unrealistic. An entertaining book - great for a light read.
5,Yet another hit by Mrs. Kinsella,"This being her latest book, Sophie Kinsella, does not withhold any of the 'magic' that is in all her books with each main character - from Becky to Emma to Samantha. This book is an entertaining and flabergasting story of a girl who is so stressed out with daily life as a lawyer that finding time to relax is impossible. Throughout the story we find out how this workaholic makes it to relaxation through, shall we say, less than normal methods! This book is a worthwhile expense!!!"
2,"Usually a Fan, But Was Just Bored By This One","I'm usually a fan of Kinsella's books as light, escapist romps. But this one just bored me. The plot can be summed up quite quickly (SPOILER ALERT - although honestly, you learn this much in the first 2 chapters) - Samantha is a hotshot London lawyer, makes a big mistake, and ends up in the country as a housekeeper. Much chaos ensues, as she has no domestic skills, and of course there is a love interest. I think the reasons this book doesn't work for me are 1) the 'country' setting is dull, compared to the hip, urban settings of most of Kinsella's books (the 'scene' is half the fun, usually), 2) the domestic chaos is not humorous but absurd (this woman got through law school?) and has all been done before on sitcoms (bad ones), and 3) the love interest is really dull.So, for me, this just didn't have the characteristics of the usual fun Kinsella romps. Oh well."
2,The Mediocre Goddess,"I was quite smitten with the Shopaholic series; I didn't stumble across them until Shopaholic Gets Married and then I read the entire series in a week.The Undomestic Goddess left me bewildered. Samantha's sudden jump from the city to the country was quite harsh and not very well coordinated. It wasn't even believable.The book has a solid back bone but unfortunately the muscles holding it all together were weak. Key points that could have and should have been expounded on were left open leaving the reader to go back and reread wondering what she had missed.Lastly, why wouldn't the author have shared bits of the love note that was given to Samantha? It's Chic-Lit! I was so disappointed! It is like leaving out the key ingredients in a recipe.If you can read this book and not get caught up in the details you will be fine."
2,NOPE!,"This doesn't come NEAR her other novels. This book was tough to get into, never really went anywhere, and honestly, it was boring. I could barely finish it. I say avoid it. This happens with alot of successful writers. They get a good book (Shopaholic), and then start churning out trash. This isn't trash, but it's not good either."
4,"Fun, light read","Another funny girly story from Sophie Kinsella. The heroine is a work-obsessed, intelligent, perfectionist, go-getter career gal -- a female archetype that I could totally relate to (smile!) She makes an (apparently) fatal mistake which sends her into a tailspin. She lands herself in a bizarre and funny predicament. I liked this book because it shows how we women can transform ourselves into whatever we set our minds to."
4,Kinsella's books don't disappoint,"Another good read from Sophie Kinsella. I found myself laughing out loud at bits. This book follows Samantha, a 29 year old lawyer, who is on the fast track to partner of her law firm. Her life is going in the direction she, and her mum, want. Long hours at the office, take away food, and no time off make up Samantha's life. After a mishap at the office, Samantha takes off, and finds herself living a simpler life - with time for herself - although, she is living a lie as a housekeeper.Her adjustment to this lifestyle is funny; this is a girl who has no idea about keeping house at all. Will her lies catch up with her? Will the life she strived for from a young age, law, call her back to London? The book was not too predictable, which I really liked. The narrative was good, and I really got into the storyline and hoped Samantha made the right decisions in the end."
2,The Uninspiring Read,"A longtime fan of Sophie Kinsella and the refreshingly witty, surprisingly relatable ""Shopoholic"" series, I was disappointed by this book. I expected it to be predictable and even unbelievable, but not plain boring and poorly written. The vocabulary was that of an elementary school student and she must have used the phrase, ""Never...in my life..."" a thousand times! It was tough to take. I sped through it to put myself out of my misery. Sorry, Sophie."
2,Two dimensional disappointment,"Enjoyed the shopaholics, but this struck me as not fully developed. The characters are not properly fleshed out. I am a lawyer and find her stupidity not believeable. With access to the internet, any intelligent person would download instructions for any household appliance or recipe. Similarly, if she had the firm by the neck at the end, why didn't she negotiate a half-time position with an office in the country, even forgoing ""equity partnership"" to get it. Anyway, a firm like that would NOT take someone back no matter the mistake, if she had run away in the manner of the heroine here. Maybe they would have offered her a cash settlement, but take her back, no way.The premise was cute, but the characters were flat and the particulars of the story did not ring true."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I found this book sooo predictable, well I know this kind of books are predictable but this was way over the top, and so dull It make me feel like I was a Kindergartner reading a story so unbelievable. I got this book just to have a little laugh and feel entertained but when I was half of the book I was more indignant than amuse. The shopaholic books were much better than this."
4,Loved it!,"Loved the story and again like any S. Kinsella novel, I want to go to England! It was funny how as a lawyer and not knowing any maid duties, the girl got away with so much lying and help. Really entertaining~"
3,a cute chick-lit,this is definitely a chick-lit for women of all ages. kind of predictable but still funny & witty. beware of alot of cursing though. would've given it 4-5 stars but was offended when a passage in the book gave an impression that Filipino housekeepers DON'T speak ENGLISH. ever heard of lillie piccio? she's PRINCE WILLIAM & HARRY'S FILIPINO NANNY who speaks fluent ENGLISH.
3,Not my favorite Kinsella book!,"I'm a big fan of all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This was the last book I needed to read to be caught up with all of her books. Unfortunately, this book is probably my least favorite of her books. The story was kind of boring and predictable and I felt that the ending was a little over-the-top."
5,Another fun one from Kinsella,"Excerpted from my original review blog post (http://mrsvsreviews.blogspot.com/2009/02/undomestic-goddess.html)As any Kinsella book I was not disappointed at all with The Undomestic Goddess. The theme of the book is trying to decide what really matters in life. Samantha was so driven to reach her goal of becoming partner in her law firm that she sacrificed a lot of her personal life in order to do so. With unexpected events she finds herself in a completely new setting and is left to ponder what she really wants. It was a fun read, just as all of Kinsella's other books."
3,"Typical, but fun","I liked this one better than Can You Keep a Secret? which just seemed too derivative of the Shopaholic books. I guess the real explanation is that Kinsella has a formula that can be boiled down to ""girl gets boy"". It's still a chick-lit fantasy, so don't expect anything too deep. Might be a good book group book since you could hash out the reasons she makes certain decisions."
4,LOVE IT,Althought this book was somewhat praedcitable. It was a good book. I love Sophie's books. I would love to see this one in a theater one day. I could just imagine what it should be like the. Sophie's writting style is that way. She makes to where you could imagine (with ease) the world she has created. Even after two years of not touching the book I still have the images in my head.
5,A fun read,"This was my first read of a SK book, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. In fact, contrary to some of the other reviewers, I liked this one better than the Shopoholic books I have since listened to. (Audio book lover, here!) The main character--SS-- at least uses her mind,speaks up, and is clever-- whereas RB generally hides her problems and repeats her transgressions repeatedly and tediously."
3,Light read that doesn't quite live up to Kinsella's other works,"I received this book along with Sophie Kinsella's other book Can You Keep a Secret for Christmas. I have previously enjoyed the Shopaholic series, as well as Remember Me? Ms Kinsella is a talented writer and always keeps her audience captivated with light hearted and far fetched tales. However, of the two I just received, I would highly recommend Can You Keep a Secret? over this one. This story was a lot more interesting than I was expecting from the book jacket, however the last 75 pages or so took a turn for the worst. Up to that point Samantha Sweeting was a likeable character despite running from her problems. Unfortunately, her actions, indecisivness and plain flakieness ruined her character, the ending left far too much open and gave no real conclusion for Samantha as well as the supporting characters who were quite likeable throughout the story."
4,The Undomestic Goddess,"This was pretty much a basic, light, fun read. It was kind of typical, and I could pretty much guess the ending. Still, I enjoyed reading it. If this book weren't funny and didn't have Sophie Kinsella's unique writing style, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. But as it is, it was fairly enjoyable and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone for a fun read, but not if you're looking for something serious and thought-provoking."
3,"Quick, fun read",I read this book in one sitting. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it. There were parts of the book that I found frustrating when the main character wouldn't speak up. This of course would have ended the book earlier and wouldn't have allowed all the drama that led up to the ending. Overall it was a cute book if you are looking for something light to read.
3,Not as entertaining as the others...,"I am a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's books. Prior to this book, I had read all of the 'Confessions' books and 'Can You Keep A Secret' and I honestly loved them all. Unfortunately, I just didn't feel consumed by this book like I have the others. I did enjoy the plot & it certainly had me laughing out loud at some points but I just didn't feel it... if that makes any sense. The good news is, I would still recommend it because everyone truly has different tastes in books and I am sure that there are people who will love it more than I did and hate it more than I did. So, take a chance and read it."
2,Kinsella has done better...,"As a big Sophie Kinsella fan, I was quite disappointed in this recent release. Normally, I can not put her books down, but it took me more than a week to read this recent release."
5,EXCELENT,"A modern love story with a lot going on. Interesting live change desitions. Fun and easy to read, great for your vacation's time"
2,Not her best....,"After loving almost all of Sophie's other books, this one was really a let down. I understand that it's fiction, but this was so unbelievable it came off as ridiculous. SPOILER: I couldn't believe after Samantha's blatant back and forth wishy washiness that the law firm kept begging her to come back. NO WAY.Don't waste your time on this one."
2,I stopped reading in the middle of the book...,"I read the whole Shopaholic series, great books, so I was eager to start reading her other books, and bought them all at the same time! I started reading this one, and I'm sorry, I know, and expect it to be, a ""light and funny book"", but I could not keep reading this. When this career woman makes a big mistake at work, and later on gets mistaken for a maid, and can't seem to be able to tell her new employer that she isn't and just stays there... Now I have this other book from her I didn't read yet, Can you keep a secret, I might get to read it someday, but I'm just not interested anymore. Thank God I read the Shopaholic series first, so I know that this author is capable of writting a good story, but The Undomestic Goddess book, is definately not her best one."
3,A light read,This book was nice and light - perfect holiday read!. It is however (as most books are in the genre) VERY predictable but the story is fun.
5,Maybe I will start reading fiction,"I've always read non fiction. I've always thought books like this were meaningless fluff~I was wrong. The author writes in a great, easy, flowing style, you get so caught up in the totally ridiculous but cannot put it down story. This book is a great escape from everyday stresses."
4,What if a grownup ran away from home?,"What happens when a hotshot London lawyer from a workaholic family of overachievers suffers a cruel twist of fate and finds herself working as a maid in the country? Like SK's other famous character Becky Bloomwood, our heroine Samantha Sweeting finds herself in one pickle after another. I honestly couldn't put this book down - for two reasons: I was a workaholic Washington lawyer who recently left it all behind for a simpler life in Florida (no I am not a maid). The other reason was laughing myself silly as one lie after another escalated into the inevitable train wreck. The book builds up to a climax, has a little twist, then there is yet another climax. In true ChickLit fashion, the endings are predictable - but you had so much fun with our heroine, you don't care."
4,4 Star Read,"I'm not a fan of Kinsella's usually ditzy female characters but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Samantha is a top-notch lawyer at a prestigious firm who makes a mistake for the first time ever. In desperation, she flees the city and becomes a blue-ribbon housekeeper (unbelievable) and falls for the gardener, leaving behind her overachieving family and dream of making partner at the firmSPOILER:While on exodus, she discovers a scandal that's big enough to win back her job and fulfill her dream. Now she must choose between her career, complete with a budding romance to a fellow lawyer or her new life in the countryside with her new love.1 star for believability but hey, its just chick lit. So overall 4 stars for its warm, fairytale ending and strong heroine."
5,Sophie Kinsella is a comedic genius,I can not say enough about this author. It doesn't matter if the plot is inplausible. She is genius and hysterical! All of her books are wonderful. They take you away and are quick reads. I would love to see them in movies. The characters are rich and complicated. Must reads!
3,ok book,"this book is ok with some great moments. towards the end, there's a great scene with the heroine serving dinner with a coworker from her law firm.its a fun read, though, and i recommend it to someone with some time to kill, maybe on a plane (where i read it)."
3,Not Kinsella's best,"I have LOVED all of Sophie Kinsella's books, however this one did not live up to my expectations. It began great and had a cute ending, but it lost my interest in the middle. It was a quick read but not my favorite."
5,A fun read!,"Bought this on the advice of my sister, who was reading it at the time. So glad I did! A funny, well-crafted story that draws you into the action and makes you wonder what you would have chosen if you were faced with the same decision."
3,a fun read,I dont normally read these type of books. A friend recommended it to me. It was a fun book to read compared to my more intense books. It was completely unrealistic but still entertaining.
2,The Undomestic Goddess,"From the beginning, it's easy to detect your standard Kinsella novel. A successful woman finds herself facing some unexpected change. She falls in love, some bad event happens, they break up, and then a few chapters later, everything's peachy. Now ordinarily, Kinsella puts enough personality into the book that makes it okay, but I don't know, something was just lacking in this one. I felt like some of the characters had great potential, but were ignored, like Freya or Sam's breakdown brother, Peter. There were parts that were so predictable that it got, quite frankly, boring. It's an interesting idea, but everyone knew how it would turn out, and all the flip-flopping in the end was absolutely unnecessary. There was just too much lacking in this book, plotwise, characterwise, just overall, for it to have been a truly enjoyable read.Rating: 2.5/5"
3,A funny easy read...,"The reason for the 3 stars is that I wasn't totally blown away by Kinsella's book, but I do recommend. The premise is funny, top lawyer has breakdown and ends up working as a housekeeper. It was an amusing book, easy to read. It's your typical chick-lit book."
3,Predictable yet fun,I didn't enjoy it as much as the shopoholic series but it was a good summer reading
5,What a goddess!,"I would like to have the guts to do what she did, have a perfect career and get on the train and start from the scratch in very unfamiliar new environment - as a housekeeper and still managed to be funny! I guess she did not think so.Honestly, this was very delightful reading.You can totally identify yourself with her in many situations as I did.I liked it from beginning. Complete page-turner. You can always find something interesting on every page."
2,Not worth my $7,"Well was it worth my $7, compared to other books I have gotten for $0.99, or even $5? no sorry. Not even close. It was Ok, had Ok characters, Ok storyline, and I liked two characters a lot Nathanial and his mother. I have read other books by Sophie Kinsella and this was my least favorite. My apologies"
3,Never made it....,"I was expecting something funny from the author but it never really quite made it. It was sort of boring in the beginning, I thought 'hey where getting somewhere' in the middle, and just made me feel bad for reading the whole book. I mean, how messy things got as it draws to an end. The character, Samantha, should have been more honest rather than running away from reality. I mean, the author should have made a dramatic end rather than a confusing one. Don't get me wrong, I love Sophie Kinsella as a writer and her other books."
2,The Undomestic Goddess,"I enjoyed the Shopaholic series tremendously. I will never forget bursting out in laughter in the middle of my doctor's waiting room when Becky Bloomwood tried to speak in Norwegian (or whatever language she'd pretended to know on her application!)I was very excited about this new book of Kinsella's and I must say I was rather disappointed. While the book has its moments, everything about it sounds so highly improbable that I was not put into a state of willing suspension of disbelief (like I was with Shopaholic) - so the book started to really drag for me barely a quarter into the story. As I said, there are a few salvageable moments and some good lessons to be learned about enjoying life and stopping to smell the roses, but I am hoping Becky Bloomwood will make a comeback."
4,The Fab Summer of Chick Lit,lotsa time at the lake to catch up with some of my faves... ah sweet summer pleasure.
5,Best of all her books!,"I have read all her books, and this one is definately the best. Although I thought the plot seemed a little weak to me, I was laughing through out the whole book! Let it to at least 3 friends, and they all loved it too!"
4,Funny!!,"I have read all of Kinsella's books and this one is equally as delightful as the rest. It is hilarious at times if you can stop yourself from saying, ""That would never happen."" about some of the scenarios the main character gets into. In fact, the main premis may make you think that as well. Overlooking this fact, it is fun to see the contrast between the main character's old job as a lawyer and her new job as a housekeeper. Very enjoyable read!"
5,Great Book,"Readers if you like Janet Evanovich Books, you will like this book. Sophie Kinsella is an English verison of Evanovich. It is funny, easy to read and very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it.Funn"
5,Miss Kinsella is very funny!,"I really do love reading Sophie Kinsella. Having read the Shopaholic books I was delighted to read this one which has the same sense of humor. It's about a high flying exec who bizzrely beomes a domestic servant! Great fun, light-hearted reading. God for a laugh!"
2,Not My Favorite Book,"This book had the potential several times to be a really good read, but just when you think the plot line is going to pull together...it doesn't. There were so many loose ends and hanging threads. I was also disappointed in the choice of narrator for the audio version as she gave Samantha a bit of a pompous, too-old-for-her voice. Not my favorite Sophie Kinsella book."
2,"Funny moments, but not my favorite!","I love the stories of Sophie Kinsella and her characters! However, this book was not my favorite. I agree with the other readers saying the situations are very unrealistic. And I believe that she made the main character a bit like Amelia Bedila in that she has no common sense when it comes to some well known domestic tasks. The ending does drag on, but if you are looking for a quick paper back read, this one is for you!"
4,Lawyer Schmawyer!!!!,"Sophie Kinsella is officially one of my favorite authors. Though I'd heard about the confessions of a shopaholic series, I never actually picked one up (Sad, I know). The story line was AWESOME!!! Ms. Kinsella you had me at the edge of my seat hungry for more. This story is comical, romantic and filled with a nice bit of suspense. Had me thinking about the high-powered corporate world and all the people that are/have been stressed by it. Although it is fiction, this book is obviously synonomous with the lives of those that are in such positions. The book allows the reader to grasp hold of a serious theme within the story-line. I quote from it rephrased ""Sometimes you don't need to have a goal in life; you just need to know what you're going to do next."" Brilliant Sophie!!!"
2,Too predictable,"The Undomestic Goddess was a fun, light read but it was too predictable. If you want to be entertained for a few hours of fun, enjoyable reading, then this is it. You'll know by page 20 exactly what is going to happen to Samantha and who she will spend the rest of her life with. If you are looking for something a little more intriguing that will keep you guessing, then look elsewhere.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short One Clown Short"
1,"Sorry, but I just did not like it","I have no idea how so many people liked this book. I just hated it! so many things in it are just not right.First of all, while i am not a particular fan of time travel, i can enjoy it, but 400 million years in the past is a little too much! It's almost like the book is making fun of time travel and those that enjoy it!!Then the characters- even if the writers had only seen the pilot episode they should know the characters a bit more! Neeklix is portrayed as a total idiot and coward, Harry as a total novice, Belana was slightly better but a little too agressive. All the characters in general were not well developed or portrayed.The dialogue! Particularly the dialogue between Tom/Tuvoc and Janeway giving orders on the bridge was almost redundant! Not well developed at all.I generally hate writing bad reviews, but this book was way too disappointing. It even had spelling and grammer mistakes in it! Sorry, but I just did not like it"
4,"Fun book, solid four stars.","""Miss Lacey's Last Fling"" is one of the better-written regencies, Ms. Hern has a style that is very easy to read, with a happy, bouncy attitude that shines through!Unfortunately for this book, I had picked up ""Blue Castle"", by L.M. Montgomery, on the same day, and while both books have a similar plot, L.M. Montgomery did it so,so much better, that ""Miss Lacey's Last Fling"" was almost a pale shadow in comparison.But this is definitely one of the better Regencies, a very enjoyable and entertaining read."
3,just ok,"At 26 Rosalind/Rosie believes she is dying of a disease inherited from her mother and decides to kick up her heels while she can. She's an engaging heroine but who knows why she falls for the pedestrian hero? What starts out as amusing devolves into farce, with the supporting cast developing into the interesting characters. A good start with a disappointing finish."
2,silly,"This book plot is thin, transparent, and completely devoid of mystery, The characters are cliché, and in no way could the reader ever believe that Miss Lacey' family would be so forgiving, despite the extenuating circumstances - a complete waste of time"
3,Miss Lacey's Last Fling,"I enjoyed this lighthearted book. For a Regency Romance, the storyline is unique and the characters well drawn and likeable. Compared to the marvellous Georgette Heyer novels I have recently discovered and become addicted to, it was a little bit lacking in depth and sometimes a little too obvious ... but very enjoyable nevertheless."
3,Sincere second side,"Ambitious lo-fi pop does often stumble on clunky experimentation displaying cleverness simply for its own sake, but when not self-consciously pleasing indie fans, pleasantly channels low-grade, Beatles-esque sentiment with modern swagger that feel neither forced nor phony."
4,The late great Dr Mendelsohn,"Bless his heart i love his work. Especially his How to Raise a Healthy Child inspite of your Doctor"". Thank You Dr Mendelsohn"
5,this game is awesome!,you wont believe the graphics on this game they are phenonemal when I saw this game I bought it because I am a big soccer game fan anyone like me will truly love this game!
1,Cruddy GAME,"This game is horrible. The gameplay stinks. My advise don't buy the game. I play soccer. I know what it feels like. It's way to easy to score. if you wan't a challenge, buy Fifa 2001."
2,After opening the package...,"I was overcome with the horrid smell of mildew and storage shed as soon as I opened the zipper (it probably has to do with its warehouse storage).. I have no idea how much it costs to dry clean a queen size down comforter, but the quality of the fill isn't very good either- it is pokey and you can see the grey/black feathers through the casing which doesn't look that great either. Overall, I'd say don't bother with this product. I wanted white because I purchased a cream colored down comforter from Target about two years ago and it was great- it was around $50 including tax and for the $20 difference, you get atleast triple the quality of product."
1,only 5% down,Notice the content label: 95% feathers and 5% down. 5% is probably the minimum amount to get on the list. A similarly priced polyester comforter will probably give you better durability and better warmth.
2,very very thin,"do not, i repeat, DO NOT pay more than $25 for this comforter. i've seen it for 39.99 often, and i think that is the biggest rip-off. first of all, it is more feathers than down (i doubt there is any down in there at all... maybe 1%), and the thing is THIN. if the price is > $25 and you live near an IKEA, go buy their cheapest comforter - that's a much better deal i think. otherwise, if you're looking for a really thin comforter, wait for the price of this one to drop."
1,Terrible odor and understuffed,"I returned this item because it had a bad odor. After a couple days of sitting out of the package, it didn't get any better. As some one else mentioned, the feathers were visible through the cover. I expected more stuffing.Amazon's return instructions were great, although I still haven't been credited. This is the first item I've ever returned to them."
3,Surprisingly warm and light at the same time,"This is one super warm comforter! I normally sleep hot, and within just a few moments of sliding underneath this comforter, my bed is toasty no matter how cold the room. It certainly does have the ""rustling paper"" sound that other reviewers have mentioned, but I don't find that distracting (I sleep with a fan on to create white noise, anyway). It's perfect to take on a road trip, because it's not bulky at all.I have noticed that it doesn't ""breathe"" as much as I would like. Because I get so warm underneath, it causes me to sweat a bit, and the comforter tends to trap that inside."
3,Average product,"It's pretty thin and has some minor defects (pointy feather come out from the comforter). But if you buy this one as an additional layer, it will be ok."
3,Comforter smells,Has a distinct odor to it-hoping it will go away after its aired out. Otherwise its nice and thin but very warm.
2,Not what I expected,"Was very disappointed in this comforter. While it is heavy like I had anticipated, it is not soft in any way shape or form, it is like newspaper, it crackles on the bed and makes noise all night long."
3,good for the price,"the blanket makes noises (kind of like the outer layer was made of paper), but that gets better over time. and there's nothing else about it I can criticize. ok blanket for ok price."
4,SHouldn't increase the price that much,"When I bought this one, in fact I bought 7 or 8 I only paid $13.04 free shipping. Now they're selling it for $23-26 each one. I should wait on Amazon to have more, for maybe the same price, and don't pay more than that.I give 4 star, because for the price, what can you argue."
2,Only if your a Pare` fan and probably not even then.,"This is just dark, without much to recommend it. Sci Fi but not much of a decent story behind it. The acting isn't much. I ordered because I am a Pare` fan but even with him in it, I doubt I will watch it more than once. That was bad enough.The story deals with a machine much like you have seen in Matrix. You can ""play"" in another dimension. Then the inventor is killed ( Michael's girlfriend) and creatures from the other dimension start to be able to ""come through"" into this one. Every body runs around with plug ins to their head so that they can ""play"" this all the time. A bad area for the human element indeed. Foxy Loxy"
5,Web sites with consistancy without days of class,"I found that NetObjects is not only economical, but easy to understand and use. You can design web sites that are consistent as to style and links, yet dynamic and interesting. Easy to understand. If you have used any publishing program before, you will have your web site up and running within a day. And it will look GOOD!"
1,this game stinks,"The graphics are worse that the Atari 2600 version of Pong. I couldn't tell which ""character"" was me, and which were the aliens. Don't waste your time on this poor ""game"". Buy one of my great CDs instead, and entertain yourself by playing the air guitar for hours!"
5,"Classic, brilliant game","This is definitely the best of its kind that I've played. Half-life wasn't really revolutionary - it was just a top, top quality game. It has got everything - huge attention to detail, great graphics, great storyline, realism, atmosphere, excellent A.I., great multiplayer (see Counter-Strike), great challenge. My only reservations are that it loses its way slightly when you enter the alien world. Once completed, the one-player version is still great fun, although maybe it doesn't have the playability of say, Unreal Tournament."
5,Funny and great AI,"I love this game, [it] scares me [so bad]! I never had that happen before, and i'm only talking about single player mode. Multi player rocks!"
4,Arguably the best FPS crawler ever,"My only experience with the game is the solo aspect. From a solo standpoint the game is probably the best shooter/crawler ever but to linear for me. I like a more open, sandbox type game. Half-Life took an already crounded genre, refined and did it better than anybody before or really since. Flawless game play, easy and intuitive controls and top notch story line. I think the story was the best part of the game. Despite my personal views this really is a must have for any pc gamer as it really is the top game in its field."
5,There is nothing to say! THE BEST GAME EVER!,"This game is just amazing. It has won numerous awards in over 50 publications and deserves each and every one of them. I have been a subscriber to the magazine PC GAMER for the last two years and each of them, it has won top 50 games of all time. There is no doubt about it in any way. The graphics in this game were the first of its kind. Many games use its engine or have improved on it it minor ways. The story was as if you were watching a movie. As you played, the story unfolded in front of your eyes. Characters were well developed and it had a great plot, conflict, and resoloution. Half-life has had two expansion packs: Opposing Force and Blueshift. Each of them shows the story from a different perspective. Very cool. I think this game was very well developed and it will be a game that people will need to have. A game that has set the standards. And most of all, a game that I love!! HALF-LIFE RULES!!"
5,One word... perfect,"Chalenging yet fun, a masterpiece, stunning graphics and a great story line, and the multi player is just brilliant, high speed internet helps, I have cable, Even though I have beat it, I still love playing it A best buy"
3,"Fun game, yet lacks the immersive atmosphere I was hoping fo","Despite all the hype, Half-Life is not what it's cracked out to be. The AI is not that impressive. Most of the enemies are stone deaf. If you snipe at a soldier in an area full of his fellow soldiers, they often will remain oblivious, until you jump into their line of sight.Though the story is very minimal, it gets the job done. What Half-Life does well, is incorporate the story into the action, though the story-line is much too predictable.Although it is a very fun game, it is not very immersive. It has some great action, but the atmosphere seems too light and upbeat to really thrust you into the Half-Life world. This is a very fun and addictive game, yet the story and immersion factor are lacking."
3,It's great - if you can get it to run.,Does this game require a 3dfx card or something? It won't run on my new 800 MHz computer which has a TNT2 card (agp). :(
3,Half Life the review,"Half Life is OK, But I prefer more action in a Game. I rated this 3 stars just because of the so-so action detail. I love First Shooter games, And this one is not the action that I thought it would be."
3,What is all this hype about,"I am a huge fps fan, but i don't get why everyone likes this game so much. I found it rather boring and dull. The gameplay was slow, most of the game was just going around looking for buttons to push to activate different things, which got old in about the first 20 minutes of gameplay. i admit this game is very good, but i just cant see why it has gotten so much hype. if u want to get the coolest fps then get Clive Barker's Undying"
3,Why all the fuss?,"When first played this game I had high expectations. The game was a let-down though. This is a typical run-of-the-mill shooter. There's nothing terribly revolutionary about it. OK graphics, OK aliens, OK weapons, and OK gameplay make this an OK game. The only thing above average is the AI for both friend and foe alike. Buy UT instead, it's great, not just OK."
1,this game is ONLY AVERAGE,"All those great reviews must have been done while the players were smoking something. This game has lousy controls and is frustrating to play. This game also suffers from cheap setups that you as a player cannot avoid until it is too late. Things like falling office equipment, the floor falling out from under you, all kill your player no matter how good you are. Only after you KNOW about the traps can you avoid them. So you must die at least once at each trap before you can go on. Cheap. As far as Half Life 2 is concerned? NO THANKS if its more of the same!"
1,this game sucks,There are traps in this game where you always die no matter how good you are. Things such as the floor falling out from you and thing falling on you always kill you the first time. Only after you know about it can you avoid them. This game is also still full of bugs. The game control itself also is bad.
5,Revolutionary.,"Yes, Doom was the beginning of the FPS genre as we know it. But Half-Life marked the beginning of an evolutionary leap for the genre. Quite simply put, Half-Life is, and will remain, one of the greatest games ever. I really can't put the gameplay experience into words, but I remember when I first played this game almost ten years ago, I was absolutely absorbed. Seriously. Absorbed. At the time, the mods were sharp, fun, and novel. Counter-strike. Firearms. Team Fortress Classic.Man, those were fun days.If you haven't played this game, you need to experience it and understand what it has done to the world of first-person shooters. The enemies. The weapons. The music. The levels. The creativity. It's a cinematic experience in itself, and you're the star."
3,The only reason to buy this game.,"Ok I would just like to clear up this one nice little detail, the reason anyone should buy Half-Life is for the MODs out there such as Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, etc. Personally I think the game itself stinks, easy to beat I mean the hardest part is near the end of the game! I honestly think Valve could have done much better with this game."
3,"Fun game, yet lacks the immersive atmosphere I was hoping fo","Despite all the hype, Half-Life is not what it's cracked out to be. The AI is not that impressive. Most of the enemies are stone deaf. If you snipe at a soldier in an area full of his fellow soldiers, they often will remain oblivious, until you jump into their line of sight.

Although it is a very fun game, it is not very immersive. It has some great action, but the atmosphere seems too light and upbeat to really thrust you into the Half-Life world. This is a very fun and addictive game, yet the story and immersion factor are lacking."
2,"Popularity does not imply quality, people...","Even when this game first came out, it was fairly mediocre. Let's move on, shall we? There are many, many games that topple Half Life and Counter Strike released since 1998.Contrary to what the Amazon editorial had to say about this game, Half Life is not the bloodiest (Soldier of Fortune), is not the smartest (No One Lives Forever), and is not the scariest (System Shock 2 or Clive Barker's Undying).Half Life is a hypefest."
2,"Buy it if you want, but i dont reccomend it","First of all, the graphics STINK! The game play wasn't that bad.The story line was ok. After a while it became one of those shoot at everything you see kinda games. Im sure it was awesome when it came out but this is now, not then! If you want a good fps game get Ghost Recon or Medal of Honor Allied Assult, those are two awesome games. If you want buy it, go ahead, I won't be the one throwing my money out the window."
2,Motion sickness and bland backrounds,"I have no idea what the hype is all about. this game is no better than any other FPS. It is the same as the rest. shoot,collect ammo, run through vent shafts and underground tunnels. I am bummed that i fell for the hype. the game is not horrible, BUT THIS GAME IS NOTHING SPECIAL...."
5,This game is the BEST!!,"This is a classic shoot 'em up game. ive had it for about 4 years, mabye more. its ALWAYS been fun for me. recently ive been more into internet gaming (with my new cable modem to thank for that)! the counterstrike mod is SPECTACULAR, and so is 'The Specialists'. it is fun all around!"
4,Nice And Funny,"Who doesnt love seeing rednecks act up? Well in this film three white boys out of Iowa go a little over the top , what kinda gangsta disciple crew drives a f350? lol The movie is great and I highly recommend it . Although the white kid cant rap, its entertaining, check it out"
4,white boy in love with (what he thinks is) Black culture,"I am a big fan of Danny Hoch's standups; I heard about this movie through his article in a Hollywood issue of ""the Nation."" I couldn't find it in any video store, so I ordered it. This movie isn't real dramatic or incredibly funny - it's even annoying at times - but it does give you some insight into the crossover appeal of hip-hop culture even in places where there are no Black people (except on cable TV). It's a ""think piece"" like ""Slackers"" only on a more serious tip."
5,HILARIOUS,This was a hilarious movie just the small parts like what den corn where he's shooting the corn and the face he makes when he's mad is so funny.And the part when he's freestyling they call me bruce.....Willis gotta see this movie
3,Funny Flick,"Great movie if you want to have a laugh at stupid, country white boys who try to ""act black"". Piper Perabo is hot but you might as well kill the volume when she speaks. Unfortunately, she doesn't get naked in the movie."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"To be frank, the movie was stupid. Though it touched on an actual fact in urban America, that some white kids want to be black, say the ""n"" word, rap, and so on, this doesn't explain the bad dramatics and waste of paper that this script was on. Everytime this comes on cable, I want to throw my TV out the window."
5,Whiteboyz,"Well Danny Hoch is genius-No doubt. If you were ever priveledged to see the man do his one man show. What a talent. I teared during his show as I watched him Portray a Puerto Rican Grandfather. This movie exhibits one of those characters. The culture of white and Black on the table to study. A nice comical Story and I expect more from that guy. PS: Look out for the Gangster Dream sequence"" for an actor playing a mob fence-(ERIC RIVAS about to get whacked. I think he will be the next Pacino. He is something in a small scene with FAT JOE and Dr. Dre and Mr Talented Hoch Himself. Dont miss this movie. Danny is going to outsmart Hollywood I bet!"
3,A very good early Hitchcock movie with Peter Lorre,"I liked this better the 2nd time I viewed the movie. This is the original Man Who Knew Too Much - which Alfred Hitchcock remade with James Stewart, which was the only movie he remade. It isn't as good as The 39 Steps. the acting by Peter Lorre stands out. Basically it is an assassination plot. The other actors in this are sort of 'there' whereas Lorre's role stood out. It was a little hard to follow for some reason, maybe it was the British acting style but it makes sense at the end. It is a crime espionage film. Any fan of the great Alfred Hitchcock should see this. DVD wise the print purchased was from Westlake and from what I read there print is better then Laserlight and Madacy but not as good as the Region 2 UK releases. I am happy with the transfer overall. It is not Alpha quality thank God ! :)"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Man Who Knew Too Much is marred by the fact that none of the characters beside Peter Lorre are very interesting; if you're a fan of Hitchcock than you might want to watch it, but otherwise go for the much more enjoyable 39 Steps."
4,Wonderful Service and Good Quality,"Sabrina Silver sent my beautiful product to me within a couple days and they provided me with suffient paperwork & information about my product. I recieved everything just as I had expected. Sabrina Silver not only has gorgeous jewelry, but was wonderful to work with. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!"
4,I liked it...,"As a quick response to offset all the bad reviews, I'd just like to say that I enjoyed it very much. I didn't think the actors were bad at all. Maybe it wasn't as good as the original, but what movie is? If it's lacking in some things, it's not enough to ruin the entire film as many people seem to think. Personally, I thought it was a cute and highly entertaining movie, and I'll stick with that opinion."
1,So incredibly bad...,"The premise is predictable but cute - spoiled, but injured, princess of a figure skater taking on an earthy hockey player to compete in pairs skating. If it sparks your interest do yourself a favor ---> BUY THE ORIGINAL! This ""remake"" based on the original (this generation's snotty spoiled diva is supposed to be the daughter of the original pair) is so incredibly sad, flat, shallow... at least the actors in the original (Moira Kelly, B.D. Sweeney) were attractive enough to believe that they would put up with each other's antics. Save your money and your time."
1,Who are they targeting?,"My family was very excited to see that this movie was coming out, unfortunately, we were very disappointed. The first movie, although not totally without fault, was family friendly. We mistakenly thought that the second one would be as well. Instead, we were taken aback by the amount of foul language, nudity, and sexual situations in the sequel. I turned the movie off about 20 minutes into the movie after the male lead called the female lead a b---- and later watched the rest by myself. I was glad that I had turned it off when I did so that my kids didn't see a couple of naked bodies in the shower together.I don't know what the target audience for this movie was since I don't know a lot of adults that are just dying to see a cheesy ice skating sequel, and I don't know a lot of kids that this movie is appropriate for. Bad move on the part of Sony and ABCFamily. Could have been great for the elementary and preteen gals especially, but not as is."
2,"""To Win You Have To Be Willing To Fail""","`The Cutting Edge - Going for the Gold' released in '06 is a classic case of going to the well once too often. Actually I find it hard to believe they even bothered to make this film. Whether you consider this as a remake of the '92 film of the same title starring D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly, or a sequel to an ongoing storyline it fails miserably on both counts. In the first case, who does a remake of a film that's only fourteen years old? Even worse, if this is supposed to be a part two than why is the plot almost exactly the same?To quote from the movie, ""To win you have to be willing to fail."" That line turns out to be nothing short of prophetic. This one definitely is a flop. Watch the '92 version and just pretend this one doesn't exist."
2,It was ok,i loved the first cutting edge and i was glad to see that there was a 2nd one coming out i couldnt wait to watch it but i was disappointed too see that the originals didnt play the parents and i also did not like the shower scene and how she forgave him he seemed to defintly go back and forth between his feelings for his girlfriend then his feelings for her if he loved her so much he would of never went back with his girlfriend and then gotten engadged was very disappointed in it
3,Typical sequel,"This is a sequel to ""The Cutting Edge"". As most sequels, it just did not do it for me. It is an OK story but just re-watch ""The Cutting Edge"" instead. The acting and skating are much, much better."
1,ABC Familily original motion picture,Both movies are stupid the sequil is the worst and why ABC family says is the ABC Family's origional movie even know it was made by Calumbia Pictures(SONY)?
1,Why did they make this movie,"This is a very poor remake of a very good movie. The character changes and the story line changes were very weak. It was just plain bad. Even if it was made to be a sequel instead of a remake, the characters were not strong enough to make it an exciting movie. And the ending - there was no comparison of the ""signature moves"" on the Olympic performance with the original movie. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
2,Cutting Edge?,"I'm not a skater but Cutting Edge is one of my all time favorites and have watched it numerous times. Was really looking forward to the new one and must say was very disappointed, agree with other reviews, what could have saved it was to have had Moira Kelly and DB Sweeney return as the parents, but probably they read the script and said 'NO WAY'.... I'll stick with the original and use the new one as a coaster."
2,Where is the sountrack???,"This movie was awful, but not the worst thing Hollywood has foisted off as a sequel. If you have popcorn and a cold and a good book and want something to run in the background... not a bad choice. The acting isn't bad so much as the script is just boring and trite and predictable, with none of the cuteness that could possibly sell it. They've tried to remake the first story, but lacking all of it's charm and seemingly written in about 2 hours.This movie is most notable in that is has a fantastic soundtrack, particularly Hold Me In the Moment by Gerald Brunskill. A song that apparently exists nowhere but chopped up in this film, for which there is no available soundtrack. ARGH!!!"
2,Not up to the Cutting Edge or Chasing The Dream.,I have purchased all three of the series and feel this was the worst of the three. I loved the Cutting Edge and watch it about every two to three months. The Cutting Edge - Going for the Gold was such a great disappointment that I stopped watching it about 40 minutes into it. I watch movies for entertainment only so am no great critic as some people seem to be. I just could not get into this one. After a couple years I decided to try The Cutting Edge - Chasing the Dream so I rented it from Netflex. I liked it so much I purchased it for my collection. I feel this was as good as the first but on a little different level. More for the rednecks and for family watching. Do yourself a favor and skip Going for the Gold and get Chasing The Dream. I don't think you will be sorry.
3,What was ABC Family thinking?,"For a TV movie possibly targeted for the 16-27 year-old demographic or whatever the age bracken may be, it was an okay movie. It did have it's moments but ""Going for the Gold""? Not hardly and definitely NOT a family film. This will make for a fine purchase, when I find it in the WalMart dollar bin!And sadly, it had the potential!"
2,Couldn't live up to prequel...,"If you're a die hard fan of the original Cutting Edge movie (as I am), you can't help but compare them. This movie definitely doesn't throw even a shadow to the original one... The dialogue is a bit lame (downright unbelievable sometimes) and the acting isn't all that good. I've read that #3 is better... hopefully, but you don't need to work too hard to achieve that.. :( It's sad, because even though I had read all the negative reviews, I still gave it a shot... but I'm disappointed... I've watched the original movie about 50 times =) but I don't think I'll be watching this one again..."
1,No justice!,"This sequal did absolutely no justice to the first movie. In fact it is quite embarassing to admit I watched it more than once (my 8 year old daughter likes it). The story is much simpler and much more kiddish than the first and the ""replacement"" parents act nothing like the parents I would expect Doug & Kate to be... there is no fire between them and no fire between Jackie and Alex. Thank goodness I didn't buy this... I tivo'd it and can delete it sometime."
1,Don't waste your time,"The Cutting Edge was one of my favorite movies of all time and to watch this was extremely painful. The skating scenes were not as good as the first one. I cringed at most of Christy Calson Romano's acting - really, really bad....Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time."
4,The Cutting Edge - Going for the Gold,This was a good movie and I wanted to follow up on the original movie. It always enjoy figure skating and this had a good story also
3,A sequel or a remake?,"I don't think they decided if this will be a remake or a sequel of The Cutting Edge. It was a good movie but the identity crisis caused too many issues. You could predict what would happen when, which makes it a remake, but going in, you think it is a sequel.At any rate, if you watched the original, you probably won't be very interested in this one. If you didn't watch the first one, you may enjoy this one more as it has been updated."
4,It's definitely the right size,"These shirts are not as bright as they look online. They look prewashed which is good I guess. But the color of the shirt is not as clear as it is in the picture. You can see the background of the one online really good but the actual shirt looks pretty much plain black. Its a gift so I will edit this when the person gets it to let you know how they liked it. At least it looks like the right size so that is good! Sorry, they still haven't worn it so I don't know anything more about it."
5,Amazing! Marco Benevento rocks!!,Marco Benevento has always amazed me. He continues to push the boundaries of the Piano and I thank him for sharing these magical moments with us!
2,Can't use this on IPOD,"I bought this specifically to install on my ipod and found that you can't do it. I Listen to all of my music through Itunes or on my IPOD, even in my car. Very disappointing for the price of this collection. Too bad...seems like a great collection of songs."
3,After the Facts,"I read all of the state series starting with Independance last year. While I got engrossed in them and the Holts it was a facinating read. I feel that This trilogy which goes before the Wagons West series should have been written first or at least for those of us who will follow this type of story, let us know so that we read these first. Please make a note somewhere that Westward Expedition and Outpost need to be read first."
3,Wrong Wattage Stated,I ordered 2 of these thinking they were 25 watt bulbs (that IS what the description said as of 9/13/2012). Got 15 watt bulbs instead so I set up an exchange....and got 2 more 15 watt bulbs. Looked fine otherwise.
3,merchant mariners,"If you are a merchant mariner, you will probably treasure this book. I gave it to one and he really liked it.It did not fit what I was seeking so I did not rate it that high. It is a bit piece meal, but a nice collection ofpeople's stories."
1,Beware!,"Amazon.com is calling this a ""catalog error."" The product does not run as described. Save your money."
3,"Nice to get answers, but not the real thing","The graphics were great, and the layouts were exciting. It was a bit technical cutting and dragging the piles. Sometimes the answers were right on, and others didn't seem to help. I prefer to use the real cards, but if you love software and are intrigued by the tarot; this program may be just what you've been waiting for."
3,The Web site is better,"I suppose if I had not been familiar with the Web site used to advertise this program, I would have been happy with it. While the software offers more spreads and animated hands that shuffle, the free on-line version offers a choice of numerous tarot decks, which I thought would appear in the program itself. I'm most interested in the imagery and sybolism of different decks, so I was disappointed that I spent money to get less than I could get for free on line. If, however, you're interested in multiple spreads and animations you will probably find this program worthwhile."
2,Get the ultimate home Horoscope & Tarot instead!,"... the website is so much better, I thought they would be identical but they're not even close. I was thoroughly disappointed with the generic translations and quality of the software, screen cannot be minimized. But I was even more upset when I found out this software is included in the ultimate home Horoscope & Tarot software. After my tarot magic experience I'm pretty anti-software as far as tarot readings go, but if you must have it, you may as well get it with a bunch of other stuff for free. I actually got my Horoscope & Tarot software at [a local store for a good price], so I saved money and got more."
3,Not an Easy Reference Guide,"I'm not saying the book is bad, I'm just writing a quick review for those looking for an easy reference guide to personalities that this book is not it. It will take some time to go through this book to learn your personality as well as your mates (or you can take the Myers-Briggs, which I highly recommend if you want to make this book a easier read/faster reference guide)."
5,Wonderful flavor!!,This makes the best coffee and will use this more then my coffee maker! It really extracts the full flavor of the coffee bean! It is well worth the little extra time and found that getting the 8 cup capacity was perfect for 2 people. Makes 2 LARGE mugs. SO GOOD!!!
4,Makes great coffee!,"I bought this for my husband as a gift, but I have fallen in love with it too! I am not usually one to drink 'black' coffee, but I can using this.As others have said, the 'cups' it refers to are 4 OZ CUPS. If you're like me, your mug is a lot bigger than 4 oz! So, I wish I had bought at least the 12 cup maker. Generally, we get 2 mugs out of each use, which is fine for us, but not enough for company.That's really my only complaint. If you use coursely ground coffee, there is no grittiness. It's pretty easy to clean too."
2,Eight cups.... I don't think so. Not im-Pressed :(,"I purchased the 8 cup size thinking it would supply enough coffee for 4 people camping. Not even close. While it works just as described and produces fine coffee (with a huge amount of grounds), I could not get it to produce more than 2.5 cups (not huge oversized cups, regular size cups like you would find in a restaurant). I thought this would be the solution to my camping coffee needs, but it's not..."
2,Exagerated,"My wife does not drink coffee, so I make two cups for myself. In the quest for a small quantity of brew, I bought the Bodum 4 cup. I also have a Cuisinart ""Two to Go."" After comparing the brewed coffee in both, I give the Cuisinart two thumbs up over the Bodum. In the Cuisinart there is minimum cleanup, since it uses a paper filter. I don't have to grind the coffee since it uses ground coffee (I see no taste advantage in grinding my own coffee). The Cuisinart brews in about 3 minutes, which is faster than the Bodum. The Bodum is nicely constructed and appears to be a quality product; but for better tasting coffee I've switched to Eight O'Clock (top rated in Consumer Reports)and added a pinch of salt."
3,It's just ok,"I like this french press, but the glass tends to break easily, I've broken two in the last two years, and it doesn't keep the coffee warm for long. Also, it's a little hard to clean out the grounds that get stuck in the screen, I cut myself trying to clean the thing, watch out the edge is very sharp.I recently bought this coffee press from planetary design[...]keeps coffee warm for 2 hours+ and is indestructible, which is a big bonus for me. Excellent for camping too."
3,THEY'VE CHANGED THE DESIGN--FOR THE WORSE,"I've had 3 of these. The latest is a serious disappointment. You can no longer unscrew the lid's plastic liner, which means there is NO way to drain water out of the lid when it gets in there--which it will, sooner or later. Bad idea, Bodum. The pennies you save by eliminating the metal nut that allowed us to unscrew the lid liner will cost you customers when people realize they can no longer clean the lids properly."
2,Poor quality beaker breaks after 2 *gentle* cleanings and one use,"The glass beaker, stamped with ""Original French Press Bodum(R)"" broke after 1 use and 2 gentle cleanings. I would now not suggest buying any of their presses without the unbreakable glass, or suggest budgeting the replacement into the initial purchase. Why would you pay that much for a press?"
1,Broke on first use. Terrible Customer Service!!!,"I requested this product as a gift; my Mom complied. She ordered online and then packaged it and sent it to me. I'm an overseas servicemember, and the gift took over 30 days to arrive to my APO address (from the time it was originally ordered).Of course the glass broke on the very first use, so I never got a cup of coffee from it. I wrote an email to Bodum explaining the time-of-delivery situation, and the product quality issue.Bodum didn't respond within three weeks, so I forwarded the same email from my ""sent"" file. They got back to me within a few days stating ""sorry, no exchanges after 30 days"". If I remember correctly, even within that 30 day period they keep a 15% convenience charge on returned items.The market is too saturated with quality products to suffer this unreliable press. The customer service is the icing on the cake. I urge you to avoid this company."
2,It has a serious design flaw,"It works well, for a while, but the threads on the plunger wear down extremely quickly. In a matter of months, you will no longer be able to assemble the plunger after cleaning. As far as French presses go, that is not long enough. I only used the product as instructed."
3,Plastic on the lid,"I own a stainless steel French Press by Frieling. It leaves a few grounds in the cup each time so I thought I'd try the 8-glass Bodum. The Bodum lid has a plastic piece through which the coffee pours each and every time. So, while the Bodum doesn't leave grounds in the cup (only the annoying sludge), I'm returning it because of the plastic. Hot water and plastic do not go together. Plus, a previous reviewer mentioned that the Bodum plunger doesn't go all the way to the bottom. It should; but it doesn't."
3,"You're what?... Tin roof, RUSTED!","Wife bought mine from Bed Bath and Beyond using a 20% off coupon. I've owned the press for 2 weeks and it works as advertised. I've been brewing intelligentsia coffee and the coffee taste great. The only con is that the steel frame has started rusting from hand washing the press after each use. The rust is definitely a turn off. I'm thinking about buying the Bodum Brazil 8-Cup Coffee Press which has a polypropylene handle and base, which won't rust and it's only 19.99 on Amazon as I write this review."
3,Disappointing Battery Issue,"I had taken other reviews into account when purchasing, and all looked good - and I did get my phone/ans machine in just a few days. However, when I started it up and let it charge the 12-15 hrs (and a 2nd time!), the battery simply wouldn't hold a charge - so I went to Radio Shack for another, at an additional $18. When I reported this to Cris and Dan, they offered a $10 refund (for a better review). When i tried to ""negotiate"" a better refund ($15), I heard nothing further! So, I'm still out almost $20 more than the original cost - and therefore I'm revising my review down from 4 stars to 3!!"
4,Is that an electric shaver in your pocket?,"Nice little phone, except the ""silent"" vibrate mode is very loud. It sounds like a swarm of angry bees or an electric shaver, and everyone in the room will look at you when it goes off. (Note this is not when it's lying on a desk; I have it in a holster on my belt.) So much for being discreet."
5,THIS IS A GREAT PHONE!!!!!!,"I just got this phone today and I love it! The only problem I have is that it doesn't have a ""Beep-Beep"" But I don't care because I already have another phone with that. The camera on it is great! And the phone is a great price.....I love everything about this phone! Buy this phone!"
3,amazon rip off,You are not getting a deal by buying this from Amazon. They just jacked up the price to $150 and make it seem like its a deal to save $50. Virgin Mobile's site sells it for $99.
1,The Virgin Mobile Snapper:,this cell costs alot of money and my suggestion is to watch what you do and read the manual before you use it because even seeing how much money you have left costs money if you do it more than twice plus you can only send picture messages to virgin mobile cell phones
2,Although no longer available....,I got this on clearance a few years back when I got my digital camera. The photos print out slow but that would be okay if it was not for the quality of the photos. The photos I printed had a red tint to them and were grainy. If you find this for a very low price ... you now know why. I am looking to pay more for a good printer this time. I won't be fooled again.
2,Bad loose leaf tea,"This is NOT a loose leaf tea. More like tea dust. I like Twinings just fine and like to have some standard black tea around so that if I buy a flavored tea that is too strong in flavor, I can mix with unflavored black. The crumbs in this canister were so bad I had to go out and buy tea bags. It cannot be used in an infuser. It is also noticeable that the flavor is far weaker than the Irish Breakfast tea they sell in the bags. Nearly worthless as a loose leaf tea. Wish I hadn't purchased."
4,"Good Capacity, Good Price, Bad Fit","Compared to the price and capacity of similar CD towers, this one is way better. It sure is stable, it doesn't take up much space, and it has a good capacity.I only have to complain because it doesn't store the CDs very tightly. The CDs never fall out because the rack is angled, but the CDs look really ugly and crooked. I'm obsessive compulsive though, so the rest of you might not care. Personally, I'm sticking with shelves from now on."
2,"Ok, Not Great",Way too short. I actually bought this by accident not knowing it's the same as another DVD but with a different cover.
1,Ugh...,"I think she must have had her 14 year old cousin write this book. I, like others, have read many of JD's historicals and enjoyed her sense of humor and irony... however, this book is highly annoying and dull. I don't like the characters, the font is big so the details are few and far between, and the writing is so absurdly basic. I guess, at some point, successfull authors get published no matter what junk they write. Where where her editors? Oh man... I bought it used and I'm still peeved at spending any money on it."
1,Not worth reading - don't waste your time or money on it,"I have not read anything by Jude Deveraux for about five years. Though I enjoyed her earlier books, I began to lose interest and switched to other authors. On a whim, I decided to try her again.Carolina Isle starts off lame then rushes downhill at the speed of light. The book is an insult to the reader's intelligence. The characters are shallow and unbelievable. You never connect with them or buy in to their story.The storyline is ridiculous, boring, and childish. It felt like it was written for a much younger audience than one would expect for a Jude Deveraux book. It is so bad, I couldn't even make myself finish it. I threw it in the trash. There is no way I would pass something that bad on to anyone else.If this is the quality of work Jude Deveraux is turning out now, I would highly recommend you not only skip this one but any future books."
3,A squished plot,"I really did enjoy the story. I got sucked right into the story and didn't want it to end. Unfortunately, the story left me wanting more.I've been reading Jude Deveraux books since I was in high school and have turned many onto her work. But lately, I have not read First Impressions yet, it seems like she kind of pushes into the start of the story, gets the plot and characters rolling, but then drops the finish. It's almost like she made the SuperBowl winning touchdown in the final seconds of overtime but then forgot to do the dance. Don't get me wrong. I would never skip one of her novels. It just seems like the ending are missing something."
2,pretty bad,"This book was like watching a sitcom: slightly annoying, mildly entertaining, poorly written, but somehow addictive. I finished it and will pass it on to a friend with the caviot read it on a plane ride or something."
3,Thrown Together,"I am a big Jude Deveraux fan. But I feel this book was thrown together very quickly. It takes a while to get into the book and become interested in these characters and by the middle of the book it does get interesting and then she suddenly ends it without giving a plausible explanation. It just suddenly has this ending and she never really develops the characters or why it ends the way it does. I do enjoy reading her earlier books she can tell a wonderful story. But this book does not deliver as some of her past books. If you are a Jude Deveraux fan I would certainly read it, but be prepared it is not as good as some of her other paperbacks. Never really develops the characters to warrant the ending that she has. (And the book's description is NOTHING like the actual book. Not nearly as intriguing or exciting as it describes.)"
1,Poor excuse for a book,"I usually like Ms. Deveraux's books but I really hated this one! It started out with an unbelievable premise but I continued on in the hope that it would get better - NOT! It ended as stupid as it started - VERY disappointing! Now I understand why it is the first time in print - whoever decided to shelve this ""work"" was doing a great favor to the reading public! Should have stayed unprinted! I would have rated this book with 0 stars but was not allowed to!"
2,What a Disappointment,"After reading the book jacket, I had expected more of a mystery or something! It moved along quickly but there really wasn't enough depth to the book.Okay beach book, but borrow it from the library."
1,Carolina Isle,"Jude Deveraux dropped the ball on this one. It was like she got the book mostly written and then she had other things to do so she quickly wrapped it up and forgot about the our main characters. ""... Oh ya, Sara is pregnant and they lived happily ever after"". Whoa! Maybe Jude needed some extra cash, this one was in the files and she forgot she never finished it. I'm guessing all the interesting stuff is still in her head she forgot to write it down! Don't bother reading it."
1,"Jude, Jude, what were you thinking?","I usually love Jude Deveraux's books. A few of her books are amoung my all time favorite. Now, that said, I don't know what happened here. The story was implausible by any standards, there was little to no chemistry between both couples. I didn't know why any of them liked each other.Did Jude have writer's block? Someone kidnap her name? It seemed like someone else ghost wrote it or she was up against a deadline with only a vague idea and no time to think the story out. The only character in the book I found interesting was a 15 year old boy that she wrote as though he was 23. Skip this one and read any of her older works"
1,Carolina Ilse,"By far the worst book I have ever read. I agree- no character developement, no plot, no feeling- who are these people and why would we want to read about them? What a waste of money. I wish I had gone online to check reviews before I purchased. Next time I will think twice about just picking up a book because the author has written well in the past. What a disappointment from an otherwise good author. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have."
1,If you buy this one you''ll never read Deveraux again!,"I am a fan of Deveraux, McNauaght and Lindsey and usually know any title I buy from them will be enjoyed. Not this one.. Its 397 pages of RAMBLING. There is NO STORY here. It is labeled as a romance .. there is not a love story here..none. I attmepts to be a mystery or a thriller.. but there are no thrills and no real mystery.. She must have been on a deadline or angry with the publishers. Skip this one- trust me.. Deveruax has som excellent novels.. and some okay ones.. This one is an absolute stinker. Don't waste your time."
3,It Wasn't That Bad...,"I might be book deprived because I just read this on a recent vacation but it wasn't as bad a some of the reviews I read! If you are die hard fan of Jude's give it a try. I didn't like the character ""cousins."" However the plot actually gave me something to think about. What if you were on vacation and a dead body showed up in your bathroom?OK...I admit not her best but not that bad.."
1,Yuck!,"I usually enjoy Jude Deveraux books, but this one I could not bring myself to finish. What I read was a ridiculous poorly written story . Don't waste your money or your time."
1,Not Her Usual,"I have always loved Jude Deveraux, but this book was not on par with her usual. It is amazing that reviewers will give a rave review to anyone that is one of the ""in crowd."""
2,Who wrote this book!,"Did Jude write this book? I can not believe she wrote this. I'm a fan of Jude's and I enjoy most of her books, but I can tell you that this is the worst book she has ever written. Maybe she was up to a deadline and trying to rush through it.The characters were briefly described and seemed to all be a whimp, especially David and Ariel. The book was more a mystrey than romance. I'm usually okay with any kind of books, but this ending was too plain. Ariel found the treasure, without any attack. The lawyer mysteriously got captured without a fight. The ending was too plain and direct. I was expecting more, maybe a surprise ending. I usually give Jude's book a 5 star or more if I can, but I'm sorry to say that I can only give this book a 2 star. Readers should try some of her older books, they were really good."
1,not her best work,"I have really enjoyed Jude Devereaux's work in the past but this rang of Nancy Drew from beginning to end. It was something written for teenagers in the 1950s. The character's were childish and the story line sidestepped anything relating to the development of a romantic relationship. Her stories about the Taggarts especially ""Sweet Liar"" were fantastic. This was like it was written by a high school student."
2,NOT UP TO USUAL STANDARDS,I normally enjoy Ms. Deveraux's books and have read many of them. This one was not up to her usual standards at all. I struggled to finish it and was very annoyed that I had spent $10 on it!
3,Something Missing?,"I loved the book, but was very confused about how the characters went from circling each other to being a couple. I kept turning back pages to see if I had missed a chapter somewhere. The missing pieces were never explained at the conclusion either."
1,Simply Terrible,"I've read several of Jude Deveraux's novels and have enjoyed them all, until this one. Carolina Isle is, quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read, by any author. I truly can't believe that the same author of books I enjoyed so much could have written this mess of a composition. It's pathetically written with the worst story line ever. It read like a junior high short story. A complete waste of time and money. Unbelievably disappointing. If you're considering buying or reading this book, do yourself a favor. DON'T!"
2,What a disappointment!!!!!!,I too have read all of Jude Deveraux's novels and loved everyone of them. I don't mind taking an author taking a different path (take Nora Roberts for instance) as long as you do it well!! It was a waste of my money. Shame on you Jude Deveraux.
1,........Just couldn't...,I couldn't get through the first chapter so I flipped to the last and tried to read that. But I didn't even bother with that. After A Knight In Shining Armor this one just doesn't hold a candle to it.That book still haunts me..
1,What a HUGE waste of my time,"I have never read any of Jude Devereaux's books before and am afraid to buy any more. From the moment I started reading this book it felt like I was reading a child's ""princess"" book. It was disjointed and very hard to follow. The characters are not believable and relate to each other like teenagers (even though they are full grown adults). I was on vacation (where reading by the pool is an absolute must or risk boredom) and I still couldn't find a way to read more than five or six chapters. I threw it in the trash at the hotel and went straight to the book store to buy something else...What a waste of money!!"
3,Disappointing ending,"Best book I ever read...until the ending. I could not believe how corny it got and how this incredible, suspenseful story just abrubtly ended and completely fell apart. She could have done SO MUCH more with the story."
1,Much cheaper at store,"Cost less than $2 at Home Depot, suggest picking one up there unless you just cannot get to a store. Great product otherwise."
4,Works well for fine hair,"I purchased this comb in the hopes that it would be gentle enough on my fine hair to reduce hair loss and breakage. After showering, I comb through my towel-dryed hair to prior to styling. This comb detangles well, although the process is much easier if I've used a good conditioner. I still experience a lot of hair loss, so I'm not sure if the comb has helped in this area, but my breakage from combing appears to be minimal. Overall, I'm happy with this product, which has performed well for almost 5 years of daily usage."
5,An ok comb..,This does a decent job of detangling. However it is rather cheaply made and wouldn't advise buying unless it's on clearance or a buy 1 get 1 free deal. Not at all worth the full price..you can get better in the drugstore.Edit 1/4/11: I just had to coem back and re-rate this item!! 3 years later this comb is still in new condition. It has been used A LOT..daily..for 3 years! It does an excellent job at detangling. Couldn't be happier!
4,pleased,"I have used the california duster on my car for years and after getting laminate flooring decided to try this little mop... it does an excellent job, easy to get around the area rugs and after gathering all the dust and crumbs use a hand vac and ""all done!""."
5,?,"I have not yet used my item. However, based on my experience with the hand held California Duster, I am sure that I will be very happy with it."
1,waste of money,a hurricaine couldn't make this thing ring. Poor product. Big waste of money. Comes with a cheap string to hang it from a pole.
5,"A life changing journey, helps create a new way of life.","Simple Abundance is a real eye opener. I am grateful to have been introduced to SA's inner journey at this time in my life. I read the book last year, I am following the program this year...what a difference the journey makes if you keep the suggested journals. Thank you Sarah, you have helped me to help myself. I have shared SA with many of my friends and co-workers, only a few have been ready to take the journey. Those who have, it has made a difference."
5,Every woman should read this book and refer to it often.....,"As a mother of 4 who works out of the home full-time, I can't tell you how much I could relate to this book! I enjoyed it so much, I had to tell everyone I know about it (okay, just the women I know). I gave a copy to both my sister and my mother and they rave about it, too.If you have the feeling that life is just too busy, too hectic, and too demanding for your tastes, pick up this book and start reading. Give yourself a treat"
5,Every Female - young or old - should have this book!,"A cherished gift from my mom. A book full of comforting ideas, thoughts, and information that every female can relate to. Every page makes you feel warm, happy, peaceful, and grateful about your life, and inspired for the future."
3,Great Book. Arrived in timely manner.,"Arrived in great condition in a timely manner. Only problem noted was that there was writing on the first page of the book that was not described in product description. I guess the book was a gift to someone originally. Anyway, I had to remove the first page because of the writing, but otherwise in perfect condition."
2,Simply not interesting.,Couldn't get into this piece of work.The title was compelling and it got too much into the life of the authore rather than any substance deeper in the book.
5,A wonderful gift of spirit and joy!!!,"Simple Abundance has been a wonderful gift in my life. I have read it almost daily for two + years and miss it when I have to rush (the times I need it the most). Sarah's philosophy of life, combined with thoughts and ideas of numerous great thinkers, is positive, full of spirit, and growth oriented. Each time I read an entry I feel more alive and connected to the universe. As a therapist, I often give conference presentations and always recommend Simple Abundance."
5,wonderful,"A book full wisdom and sense. In the frenzy of everyday life, Sarah reminds you of whats important - gratitude, simplicity, harmony, order, beauty.. a lot of which you probably knew when you were small but somehow forgot as an adult, on entering the world of stress, high expectations, lots to do, and little time to do in. Some of it makes sense first time round, other bits you have to experience first before they make sense... and you find yourself flicking back to this page and that, finding new meaning in the words you've read several times already... kinda like a modern day bible for women :)"
5,Daily Grounding to Simple Living,"This book is one of THE most prized books I own. I recommend it to any woman. It consistently feeds the soul without a lot of jargon. It encourages women to honor, use, and appreciate the opportunity we, have of making a house a home---a rarity in this day and age.If you're interested in celebrating the home, creating simple pleasures in life, and making nearly painless positive changes in your thoughts and actions, you'll treasure this book.How long has it been since you looked forward to the next day's adventure?"
3,Not the 10th anniversary edition as the picture indicates,"Just wanted to let anyone who may be interested in buying this book from Amazon that the one they sell is not the latest version. I bought one from a book store and it was the ""10th anniversary edition"", but when I bought several from Amazon for some friends for xmas, I was shipped the old 1995 version. I'm sure it is mostly the same content, but I was just disappointed that I didn't know this going into the deal."
5,Recommended by OB to realize appreciation for what you have,Anxiously awaiting the arrival of the book. My hsuband and I have had difficulty conceiving a second child and have finally determined we're done. My OB has recommended I read this book to help me realize that what I have in life is good. Be happy with the wonderful family I have and don't want for what you cannot have. Unfotrunately we have no control over some situations in life. I have a lot more than some women. (My OB has also been in the same situation as I and has read the book herself. She condludes it has helped her remarkably.)
3,useful,this is a good daily to skip around in when you need a little inspiration. this book of hers seems to come from a real place.
5,excellent,"I was given this as a gift - from my Mother! I look forward to opening and reading in it every day. Each day, as I read, I am taking a few simple moments for self, while enjoying my morning cup of coffee. It is encouraging and uplifting to my soul and spirit. I feel spiritually uplifted, and have a better appreciation for each new day I am blessed with. It makes me stop and reflect on things and topics that I have previously not thought a lot about - or have taken for granted. It gives you a different perspective on everyday happenings and emotions. It is very comforting, and I very much enjoy it!Thank you Mom and Sarah"
4,Had some great ideas,This book really made me think and had some really good ideas. For example the gratitude journal. My one criticism is that the sections on decluttering and redecorating assume the reader has control of this. Some of us live with clutterers and had little or no control of how cluttered certain areas get. So when I read those suggestions it just brought me down until I realized I needed to interpret the decluttering as to apply basically to that part I could control which is pretty much the top floor only and let go of trying to control the piles in the downstairs. That way the book helprd me to feel more at peace with my situation.
5,Great! How to REALLY enjoy more with less!!,"This book by Sarah Ban Breathnack will, if followed faithfully, change your attitude on life. You will realize JUST WHAT is important, and what is ""fluff""---nice to have, but NOT a necessity! She writes this as a journal; and asks that you begin at the beginning, even if you receive the book as a gift in May. I received it as a gift from my sister--and my daughter (a teenager)--absolutely loves the book! (I only hope when she gets her copy, she will keep a gratitude journal; (it kind of ""grounds you"", and you begin to realize what in each 24 hours is important).....Wonderful book! Five + stars! I'd give it to anyone......."
5,Very uplifting and comforting,"I really enjoy this book and look forward to adding more of Sarah's books to my collection. There is however one thing I would like to acknowledge in the the book simple abundance on the page for October 29th there is a comment about mormons not knowing about tiths, I just want to clear something up, we do know about tiths and it is a VERY IMPORTANT part of our religion. The comments made about tiths are so true and I appriciate these comments. It is so nice to be reminded from time to time of it's importance. This book is such a enlightening book and I am so thankful for it. I look so forward to adding more of this type of insperation to my life. My thanks go out to Sarah Ban Breathnach."
4,Life's Little Truths,"I have read the daily passages for the past three years, and have found them very useful in keeping happy and satisfied regardless of my circumstances.I've tried to do the 'assignments' - like keeping the gratitude journal - and though I understand why these things are important for keeping one's mind in the right place, I found them hard to keep up.Some of the suggestions are more helpful than others, but I've found it interesting to note that if you use the book for more than one year, as I have, you gain different insights from the same passage."
5,Life Changing,"I found this book to be life changing and it raises your consciousness of what is really important to navigate life simply and abundantly. The book gives us 365 ways to improve our quality of life. This book validates many of our inner thoughts. Its a long easy read because it is so interesting and it gives you many ""ahem"" moments. It takes simple events in our lives and shows us how simplicity is great, spiritual, and life sustaining. I enjoyed the book so much that I gave copies to my sisters and we discuss the book. Highly recommended for those who need an ""awakening"". Read it and be blessed and illuminated........"
3,"Pleasant, if taken lightheardetly.","I've read this book from cover to cover and if taken seriously it will spin you into depression. There were many helpful items, but most are merely to make one smile and then continue on with real life. I especially laughed in Dec. when at one point SBB tells us to give up the friviolities of the Victorians b/c they make our holiday's too crammed up and then a few days later she tells us that we should take on the ways of the Victorians! Talk about contradictions--many abound; reader stand forwarned. I need a book for a woman of the 1990's, not the 1890's!"
5,This book is a gift!,"Well, on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it an 11! No matter on what level it's read, there are treasures waiting to be found, e.g. the end of each month's separate pages. I began highlighting special things, but fear the book is turning yellow.."
5,A way of reminding myself of what's really important,"I have been reading this book since the beginning of the year, and it's wonderful! I have found it particularly good for helping me stay focused on the things that are really important, instead of getting caught up in the stress of everyday life. I gave a copy to my mother on Mother's Day (2 days ago), and already yesterday she called me to say how wonderful the book is. She had recently retired, and said that it is just what she needed at this stage of her life. I think it's a must-read for anyone at any time of their life"
5,Good for what ails you!,"I am currently on my 3rd year of reading this wonderful book and also on my 3rd gratitude journal. I have given at least ten sets of the book and journal to friends and family. Sometimes the day's meditation is exactly what I need to hear - other times I leaf through it until I find the balm for my spirit. Everytime I read it I seem to find something new, something I apparently didn't to ""hear"" until now, and so I highlight it. The book is practically highlighted half-way through! I also have the author's newest book ""Something More"" which is good for a change; but I still find what I need for ""what ails me"" in ""Simple Abundance"" without fail."
5,Christians Beware - Your Hypocrisy & Fear Exposed Here,"For those of you ""true"" Christians (please read that Religious Right) with a selfish, vengeful and jealous God, this book is definitely not for you. For those of you ""other"" Christians whose God is all loving, all accepting and who believe (S)He has endowed each of us with Herself/Himself from within, this book is for you!For those Christians whose God is the true giver of peace from within and not the insecure deliverer of fear from without, this book is an affirmation for you.For those Christians whose know that God's divinity is indeed our divinity, this book is a comfort for you.For those Christians whose God is big enough to embrace all and small enough to respect all, this book is a gift for you.For those Christians whose God is wise enough to recognize Taoism is not their witchcraft but Her/His edification, this book is an instruction.For those Christians whose God indeed lights the fire within, this book is an illumination for you."
5,meaningful book,will definitely bring simple abundance into your life; presented in a daily format it is easy to make time to read
3,I guess it makes sense...,"I think that it depends on YOUR life. It was ok. There were quotes and some days where I could really get on board with what the author was saying but I didn't go back to January 1st, in order to work out what it was telling me to. But it was okay, I guess it makes sense."
1,Disappointed ... I wish I could return the book ...,"I saw a very positive review on this book, so I purchased it without reading the content yesterday. I am sure the author means very well, otherwise, she would not have put such a thick book together. However, the book is so ""New Age"", I could not believe it! I read about ten pages so far, and already wish I had not bought it."
1,This book is not worth one red cent.,"Christians beware! This is nothing but NEW AGE in a pretty cover. It's all about self, self, self...quite the opposite of what the bible teaches. Don't waste your money. Amazon has many great Christian books available without our having to compromise our beliefs to read them."
3,Portable/compact edition has a flimsy feel,"I can't comment on the content of the book, as I've only read the first few essays. But please note that there are a couple of editions of this book available. The portable compact / special travel edition is wrongly described as a hardcover. It is not--not in the traditional sense, anyway. It has a flexible cover that feels pretty durable (like a heavy Tyvek), but is nonetheless not a standard hard binding. The bigger disappointment is what's between the covers, though. The paper is of very poor quality, similar to newsprint. Type from the reverse side shows through and is very distracting. Perhaps this was the way to make the book lighter to qualify for the ""travel"" appellation, but the end result is to make the book itself feel rather cheap. If I were assessing on the edition's physical qualities alone I'd give it one star...and only because it's not possible to give zero."
1,What'd She Say?,"More new-age yadda, yadda, yadda. Will I ever figure out what these people are talking about?"
1,I was very disappointed in this book.,"If you are a Christian, beware of this book and keep it away from young minds. While religion is mentioned over and again, it isn't from a Christian perspective. It is from a New Age perspective and from what I did read of it, doesn't actually refer to God very often. When she does, it is in a blasphemous way. Here is a quote from March 3rd: ""If this is not what the Great Creator intended when She created the Sabbath, then I have no idea what is Sacred."" I was wary when I began this book and now I see that it was with good reason. I do not recommend this book. I will be disposing of mine and saying a prayer for the misguided author."
2,Overall disappointed,"This book came highly reccommended to me. I faithfully spent the days of the year 2000 on it, waiting for it to get better. There were occasional insights, but overall it was much of the same self-help stuff that is and has already been out there. If someone is just embarking on a journey to authenticity/spirituality it mey be a good starting point, but for one who has already been active on such a journey, don't waste your time."
1,The Must Have Guide for All Stepford Wife Wannabes,"My mother received this book from my aunt who was thinking this would be a guidance to find personal peace. No go. My mother happens to be caring for my aunt's mother (my grandmother) and is quite stressed out about it. In fact my aunts have contributed nothing for their own mother's care and haven't forked over any money, which would be the REAL helpful thing to send. Not spend $22.95 on this useless waste of a tree. This book is not the answer; it's beyond insulting. This book is so incredibly insulting to women (kitchen, cooking, cleaning) I can't believe more women don't grasp that it's repetitive and mundane and so obviously meant for those who walk around in a trance while they clean."
1,I am disappointed in this .,"By the cover, this book appears to be encouraging, etc. What I found was a steady drawing away from the only source of happiness {God} which is not ourselves. On every single page I read there was a Biblical contradiction (and I did NOT read this whole book.) If you are a follower of Christ, this is not the book for you. This book is very New Age, with every ingredient of a common cult, though the references are subtle at times. Please don't be fooled."
3,Simple Abundance,"This is a book written for women from a woman's point of view. Some the daily entries can be for all, but generally, it should be said by Amazon .com that this is the audience that is targeted.The prose is well written and the memories that it raises take me back to an earlier period in my life. I read about 20 days worth and then closed the book and placed it on my bookcase. A male looking for meaning in life."
4,Pleasantly inspiring,"This book didn't set me on fire, but I've enjoyed it returning to it over time. It offers perspectives I don't always think of, in manageable, nightly chunks. It's a nice gift."
5,What a wonderful path....,My life seamed so empty and unrewarding and going no where. I felt so lost and unhappy. A counceler I was talking to at the time suggested that this book and I went out and bought it. It has truly changes my additude about life and I am now showing people my authentic self.....thanks so much for writing such an incredable book.....
4,Less stress & more comtemplation,"As many people did, I received a copy of ""Simple Abundance"" as a Christmas present when it was discussed on the Oprah Show a few years ago. That New Year, I started reading the daily entries. For the next few years, my New Year's resolution was to daily read the appropriate daily entry. Even though I looked forward to reading the thoughtful observations, I never seemd to make it through January without missing a day. Last year, I saw Gail Kasper on TV talking about failed New Year's resolutions and got a copy of her ""Make A Decision To Win"" CD. Gail Kasper's personal experience, her systematic approach and workbook have shown me how to have a less stressed-filled life. I now find the time for reflection and am on my way, as Sarah Ban Breathnach says, ""to find the authentic life we were born to live."" I'm ordering both products to give as a present."
1,Disappointing,"While this book's claim-to-fame is simplicity, the advice it contains is anything but simplicity. Instead of embracing simplicity, minimalism, or non-consumerism, it's all about finding just the right cabinet paper that feeds your soul, or spending copious amounts of time creating a materialistic journal of all the money-wasting trinkets you'd like to fill your house. I got as far as the page where the author chastises that if you haven't been doing the work of cutting out magazine pictures and pasting them in a journal, you need to stop and not read any further until you've done this important activity. I stopped and didn't read any further. I don't have the time, money, or materialstic bent needed for this journey."
5,Very Enlightening!,This book is a must have for every woman's library. It hits on several topics that are thought provoking and soothing at the same time. Women tend to do for everyone else first and then take care of themself last. TAke the time to read this book to treat yourself! This book is awesome!
2,when writers push too hard,"I first read this book when it came out in 1995. I remember enjoying it thoroughly then, and decided to flip through it the other night.There are certainly pages that make for cheery light reading, which is what I was looking for. A little perk me up, I suppose. Unfortunately, I came across the phrase 'the sacred soulcraft of homecaring'. Gag. How long and hard did she think to come up with that one? I now feel like putting this one in my library donation pile."
5,I dread the day I finish this book,"I can't believe I waited so long to buy thiswonderful book. Somehow, the author artfully blends tips on gardening & homemaking with how to get organized and have more love & satisfactionin your life. This book is a treasure. Buy itfor yourself, your mom, and any other woman overage 30 that you care about."
1,"A waste of time, money and paper","An absolutely valuless read, consisting of hyperbole, communist propaganda, and self adulation. Nothing of value for the serious investigator. A disappointment of the first order. And this is the best I can say about it."
1,This is not a briefcase,"The photo of this product is very misleading - this is NOT a briefcase! With descriptive words like ""double gusseted expandable pockets"" I expected something I could use to carry a few files. The only pockets in this are small enough for some pens and loose change. The title of this product needs to be ""women's purse that looks like a miniture briefcase"" and it should be filed under fashion accessories, not briefcases. I am very disappointed."
2,waste of time,"When I rented this movie, I was expecting some helpful things like.... penis stretches or some kind of guide for the uncertain male about himself, but it turned out that this movie is just a documentary of several guys with different ethnicities talking about a variety of subjects. Some of the topics that were touched were masturbation, erectile disfunction, etc. and there was hardly any nudity.... some, but very mild. Overall, this movie was more about what a bunch of guys thought about their penis."
3,Love dicks so i had to see this! haha,it sure is very informative to men i encorage all men to watch it is informative fun and enlightening!oxoxox
3,Resourceful,In doing a abstinence based bibliography for a book I am publishing I came across this video and I found it to be helpful. As a resource it was done in a tactful manner and I would recommend it for mature audiences. It does not deal with the issue of abstinence as I am focused on but male sexuality/self image and the correlation was what I found useful in this video. The nudity was not provacative and presented in a way any man who's been to a public shower would experience it or a person working in the health care industry male or female.
2,Boring!,"This documentary only furthers the idea that it's best not to show male genitalia on screen. Of what are they so afraid? It contains VERY little nudity.I'm glad this movie was so cheap, because I would be mad if I had paid more.It's not what you expect. The movie is a series of interviews with a bunch of ethnically diverse men jibber-jabbering about sex and their members.Boring as all get out."
3,SO....SO....,"This was not that good, it's very dated. However there is a guy who talks about his extremely small penis and another guys thing which was like 13"". It wasn't bad for being bored and not wanting to spend very much on renting a movie."
1,K-Tel Counrty Gospel,"I am a Ray Price fan, but was disappointd by the low production values in this cd. That I did not spend much was the only saving grace."
4,an older ray price still shines,these are the gospel recordings ray price made in 1993 for k-tel-dominion.his voice is not as strong as in his youth but he made a valiant effort. i give him an A for effort.one could tell that ray had been raised on this music. i have played these in church and i heard no compliants.if you liked these recordings then you might like to check out RAY PRICE--GREATEST HITS--on k-tel-dominion-1993.
1,She thinks she can sing...,"Of curse she can sing, but only in the shower.All the reviews are false.Don't buy this record."
1,My cat couldn't chew these whatsoever,"My cat is a very picky girl and has pretty much refused to eat any dry food. In concern of her all wet food diet I bought these to try to help her teeth. They were like rubber, not crunchy at all, my cat tried playing with it first not realizing it was a treat, when I finally convinced her it was food to try it, she bit down on it several times not being able to break what I would call the ""skin"" on it and finally gave up and left the soggy mess for me to clean up. They don't seem to have any appeal to cats, they're just rubbery discolored bits that look more like droppings that treats."
3,Not for everyone,"I originally bought this to supplement my Black Company game (from Green Ronin), which is a Mercenary type game for 3.5. Some of the prestige classes I wouldn't use (ie the Mechanist or the Mechanist Calvary)--but the subtypes are interesting, since the BC setting already uses backgrounds, I might just supplement some NPCs with the subtypes. Please note that most of this book is geared towards the NPC Warrior class. Gladiators are interesting change from the WoTC Sword and Fist version--its kinda what I wanted the Wizards version to be (although I would add more gladiator fighting styles).Some of the skills and feats were already duplicated or done elsewhere in other sourcebooks (and presented better elsewhere), although I do like the Smell/Taste skill (I've been just using a Spot check, but smell or taste checks don't come up that often) expanded Profession skills, especially the Profession Bartender.A lot of the stuff is hit or miss and the artwork is horrible in most cases."
5,A great resource!,"For DMs and players interested in running military, THERE IS NO BETTER RESOURCE AVAILABLE. Outstanding."
4,It's durable,the plastic case is flexible (not brittle like many slim cases). The case is fully closed; no more dust on your disks like many other slim cases.These two reasons are enough for me to buy again.P.S. The disk holder is not very perfect but I can live with it
1,Storage irregularities,"When storing CD/DVD's using these cases, the length causes unbalanced look in the storage unit. Since most of the case are slightly longer. In some storage units they sink in too much making it more difficult to retrieve from its slot.Also, when trying to label the binding you need extra tape to make sure the label stays on.I doubt that I would buy these again."
1,Junk,These are the worst CD case that I have ever seen. Basically they are made of really bad plastic and they are very hard to open. You cannot figure out from which side you would open it so you have to try a from all the sides until it opens. And sometimes you have force it which causes it pop the CD and then it could potentially fall.
1,"Thin, sharp plastic, breaks easily, no double DVD fittings","The price is totally cheap, and that's just what sort of product / construction and materials you will get too! I had won this as a door prize, what a wreck, the thin plastic breaks and shatters (much like other products from the manufacturer). The edges of the plastic are also very sharp and I have given myself a cut at some point. From the picture on the front slip that the tower comes in, it looked like a good design, nope, DVDs are difficult to slip in and out of the slots and there is no room for double DVD cases. Skip this product!"
5,My Favvvvvvvvv Fiction Book,"Aloha, Fern Michaels!!! ""Desperate Measures"" is absolutely, positively, indeed, My Favvvvvvvvv Fiction Book in the Whole Wide World. I truly enjoyed reading it -- immensely!!! It was so heart felt and touching, especially concerning the two young boys, who made promises to each others. Although time, age, distance and dire circumstances kept them apart for decades, they reunited later in life. I often reread that part when things are going sour in my life as to glean a lil more hope and strength.The ending was simply, superb. I've read many of your books and look forward to reading more. You're indeed my favvvvvvvvvv author in the whole wide world of fiction, hehe. Keep up the {{{GOOD WORK, FERN!!!}}} I shall read perhaps alllllll of your books, this life time, lol.Mahalo for sharing your ingenius wrting talents w/ the UNIVERSE.God Bless,JASMINE STARR in Hawaii"
2,TOO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE FOR ME,"I have liked all of the books I have read of Fern's but this one is the first that has crossed the line for my distaste in reading two different ways to curse.I have stopped reading it and hope that the othe4 10 books I have by her lack these words.Ms. Michaels, please do not use God's name in vain in your writings and the F word.This is my humble opinion."
3,A Bloody Good Read!,"Although extremely violent, sometimes just short of disturbing, this is a good adventure story with a compelling character. Cross writes what he knows and he knows the martial arts. Filled with intrigue, violence and sex, this is not a book for those with a weak stomach. Although I liked this book, Cross has written better stories. His Mongo Mysteries, written under his real name, George C. Chesbro, are a little deeper and have a larger cast of characters. Chant even makes an appearance in one of the Mongo books, entitled, 'Dark Chant in a Crimson Key'. Overall, Chant is a good choice if you are interested in the martial arts and enjoy spy stories or adventure novels."
4,Nabbed by Nero,"This was what I ordered and what I got. Unfortunately for me, I missed the detail about it being Video verses a DVD. I wanted the DVD. However, for my purposes, the VHS format will work. This series of videos is wonderful. I have been teaching Ancient Roman history to a small classroom. Although not weekly, we watched most of the videos during the semester. It was a treat and took us back to that era. Great stories!"
4,TREATY CLASSES OF U.S. CARRIERS,"Again, very good series of paper back books. This is a good one as it is organized in a unique format. Has good and concise information with interesting photos and color plates."
2,Truly disappointing,"Let me start by saying I find the subject matter of this book fascinating -- contemporary use of the Cherokee syllabary among Eastern Cherokees -- but I had to force myself to finish this book. With the research Bender performed, she could have given us a vivid account of how the language is used today. But only limited quotes or paraphrases of actual Cherokees make their way into the book, along with very few specific examples of the syllabary in use. Rather the book is an endless series of repetitions of her personal conclusions. Her dichotomy of ""Christian"" and ""pagan"" (spelled plainly on p. 37) is not only errant but also insulting."
1,Jesse Campbell-Never Let You Go,They show you a CD but you don't realize that it's a cassette tape until you order it and they send you the receipt. It wasn't worth sending it back.
5,Great Album,I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the album. I have played it over and over again. I loved every track on it and he has a nice voice.
4,Beautiful - not too comfortable,"A little stiff, and no heel support, but can be easily fixed with heel liners. But they look beautiful on a foot, and and the heel is not too high. Overall, if you're used to heels and know how to adjust any shoe to your foot, then it's a good buy for $20 - they look just like Steven that are way over $100."
4,Play the electric guitar with some REAL sound!,"If you're looking forward on playing fast and with a rock, heavy metal sound, this book is for you! Contains 32 examples and it's played in 3 different speeds and with tablature. Improve on speed and learn how to pick faster. Play with melody and add some color to your playing."
1,I regret wasting the money,"This book is horrible, uninstructive, and short. There's about twelve pages of tab, with ""helpful hints"" such as ""now try alternate picking,"" or ""now practice your sweep picking."" As mentioned earlier, all of the tabbed runs are very eighties, very classical sounding, and, unfortunately, there is no instruction geared towards re-applying the tabbed runs in more contemporary settings. Buy another book, or better yet, just buy a metronome and practice, practice, practice."
1,Very Dated -The Title is misleading,"I just got this book and let me tell you you are better off not buying this. This book primarly deals with arpeggios and nothing else. No legato, no real picking exercises or anything like that. All the exercises are dated, like late 80's Neo Classical dated. If you want to play like Yngwie, Vinnie Moore, or the rest of the bunch this book will put you in the right direction. 12 or 13 years ago this book would have helped me but today it surely won't. I think this book is for beginners. Any one who has played guitar for more than a couple years won't benefit from this junk. I'm suprised they still print this or at least didn't revise some of the material for more of todays players like Satriani, Vai or Eric Johnson. I'm very let down by this book.What a waste of 12 bucks! If I could return it I would."
1,Mastering English: An Advanced Grammar for Non-Native and Native Speakers by,The book explains a lot but lacks of examples. I put it down after looking at it for 3 minutes (so my book is new). I will give it to one whose English is good enough to read it free.
1,"Euro Sized, beware!","This is a very nice suit, however Amazon is selling this suit sized for Euro not US measurements. There is a difference of 10 sizes between US and Euro. If you are a 38, this is a great buy. I was sorry to have to return this suit"
5,Floor Duster,Great product. I've used the car duster before and having a longer handle is much easier on your back on floors.
1,Super floor duster borken - cannot find parts to fix it,We have been using this duster on our hardwood floors for about a year now. The threaded hole has cracked and the handle fell out. I used a hose clamp for a temp fix and it lasted for another 3 months then the entire assembly broke.This connection should have been stronger. The instructions say to shake before and after use. This should have been a stronger part than it is.I cannot even find this item on Amazon anymore. So now I must look elsewhere for my hardwood floor maintenance.
2,Great duster but super cheap plastic part,"I bought this duster about a year ago for my wood floors and absolutely loved it. However, after just a few uses, the orange plastic part that connects the handle to the head of the duster cracked and completely fell apart, rendering the duster useless. It was too late to return via Amazon, and I've been unable to find anything else to fix it with so it's sitting in a closet. I just wrote the company; we'll see if they can help. I wouldn't have spent the money if I'd known that could happen."
1,worked for a week,"Cheap plastic handle made in Korea, fixed with duct tape from Kentucky. Handle broke by the 4th use. Picked up dust well enough when it was new, but very cheaply made."
5,duster,"I got it for my Jeep, it works perfectly on my Cherokee with it's flat surfaces. Much better than the old style smaller dusters. It is heavy, but does a great job in no time at all."
3,california duster,"I bought a cal. duster about 8 years ago, still have it . Always used it on my black bike. My new one came the other day and boy was i disappointed . They sure don't make them like they used to. Not nearly as many fibers. sending it back."
1,Broke on first use,"I recently had hardwood flooring installed on my entire first floor of my house and was looking for a good duster. The product was received in a timely manner as promised. Within 5 minutes of using it, the handle mechanism broke. I already threw away the packaging so am not sure how to return it. I guess I can try duct tape."
2,To heavy for me,Seems to pick the lint up but to large for me and heavy to be using all the time. I could not figure out how to remove the mop head to wash it so just removed the handle and washed the whole bottom. It turned out fine but I would buy a different mop soon.
3,"Good product, but not what I was looking for.","I have the California car duster and have been using it on my Corvette for the past two years. I would not know what to do without it.We recently moved into a new home in which the bottom floor consists of mainly hardwood. We also have two dogs. I was hoping the Floor Duster would be a one step process, unfortunately it was not. Turns out the dog hair and dirt is too much for the duster to handle. Don't get me wrong though. If you do not have a pet and want to just dust the floor, it'll work great. Again, I think California Duster makes great products and would not hesitate to by more if needed. I have the water blade and the car duster that I could not do without. It just happens that the floor duster is not what I was looking for. Hope this helps..."
3,"It's OK, But I Don't Use It","I got this thinking it would be easier to use on the ceramic tile in my kitchen and dining room, but I find that I hardly ever use it. It just seems like my little electric broom/vacuum thingy works better at picking up stuff from the floor so I still pull that out, even though I have to deal with the cord.I really wanted to like it and will probably give it another chance, but I'm definitely underwhelmed by it. I do like the mini duster, though. This particular product just isn't what I was hoping for."
4,always wanted to read this,Just started what looks to be a long but rewarding project. I mix chapters in with some fiction. Excellently written. At times a little too self serving. Makes one wonder what errors we're making to cause problems in our future.
4,the grand alliance,"I have now purchused from Amazon all six volumns of Winston Churchill's "" The Second World War "" I purchused these in book form at least 45 years ago but only read about two them, but with my KINDLE I am starting the third book in the series becauce it is so much easier to read now that is on my KINDLE."
5,A Must for History Buffs,"Churchill's series on World War II is engrossing. The depth and scope of the war itself were immense so reading this much detail about them in the voice of the person who had arguably the best understanding and greatest involvement is fascinating.For a less capable writer, the detail of the material would be too meticulous to be interesting. That is not a problem with this book or this series. Deft handling of the language keeps the tension mounting and the interest building.Personally, my favorite pieces of the book dealt with the communications between Churchill and FDR but there are certainly other highlights. As an American, most of my education regarding World War II dealt with the European theaters. This book puts a tremendous amount of focus on the conflict in North Africa which I found highly educational and engrossing."
4,personal opinion,"The book, as all in this series, is very well written and is a must read for true WWII history buffs. The Appendix are a must read for history buffs but can be skipped for the casual reader. Many of the tables and charts are not readable on my Kindle. This is true for all the books in this series."
5,Recommendable,"Fine Rolling Stones tribute album. Well known Stones songs recorded instrumental (no vocals) in bluegrass style by excellent musicians. Most I like ""Honky Tonk Women"", ""Paint It Black"", ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", ""Start Me Up"" and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction""."
4,Doors Fans: Unite For a Wild Ride!,"For everyone who is a Doors fan, has read the Morrison bio 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' and loves a good story... buy this book today!!! Ray Manzarek, who probably knew Jim better than anyone being his college friend and cofounder of their wildly successful band has given us a superb first novel. He toys with the concept of Jim being still alive out there in the world. And this leads him on a journey to the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean to find him. The story is moving, touching, and believable to the point that you almost wonder if Ray isn't holding out on us. In any case, the book is well-paced and beguiling the whole way through."
3,Real or Cheap Shot?,"Hungry for anything new about Jim Morrison, I devoured this book hoping that just maybe it could be true? Until..I came to the ending...what a letdown! Now that I've heard Ray Manzarek talk about it, I've rethought my opinion, and feel Jim would never have done the things said in the book....but Ray would have! This is Ray's story about what Ray would have done, not what Jim would have done. So now why would Ray write this tale? and destroy the shooting star effect Jim left on all of us with such a pedestrian ending. Is this real, I think not, or is this a cheap shot?---either way it's entertaining, thought-provoking, and written by his best friend."
2,Self-indulgent,"I expected this book to be a self-indulgent attempt by Manzarek to fulfill what is probably a huge fantasy for him. No problem, I wanted a little indulgence myself. But this book goes far overboard into nonstop self-congratulations.Rather than simply embrace the fun notion that Morrison is still alive, Manzarek has Morrison apologize (over and over) for how poorly he treated the other band members while constantly giving them credit for making him the icon that he was. Manzarek even has Morrison compliment the albums that The Doors produced after his departure. It's actually a bit embarassing to read such a transparent attempt to assure the world that the rest of the band was worthy of Jim Morrison."
5,The Poet in Exile,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked that it showed Jim so at peace with himself and finally truly happy. I do not normally read fiction but got it cause I am a huge fan of The Doors, esp. Jim. Great book and worth the time."
1,I wanted to like it...,"I really did want to. I was a huge Doors fan back in the 60's and have recently started reading the many books on them, including this author's memoir, ""Light My Fire"", which I liked very much. This novel, however, was so ridiculous that after the fist 30 pages, I should have known what was coming. By about 50 pages in, he had found and solved the mystery. Come on! At that point, I had my own (better) ending picked out, skipped a bunch of the middle, and was laughing sadly at the actual conclusion. The ""disguised"" names he gave people and places were so silly, and the way he referred to the other 2 band members as simply ""the guitar player"" and ""the drummer"" was actually a favor, although I'm sure he didn't mean it to be. I would love to believe that somehow Jim Morrison faked his death and is alive and well out there somewhere, but I know it's not true and this just seems to be a way of making money from a long-past tragedy."
1,Let Jim rest in peace!!!,"It is absolutely unbelievable that a man like Ray Manzarek, who claims to have been the close friend of Jim Morrison, has written this book. Manzarek should have kept this fantasy to himself; by writing this book he has only exacerbated all those false rumours that Jim is still alive. How could you have done this, Ray? And you call yourself a friend of Jim? What was the point of writing this? I'll never know, but I know Jim Morrison is dead and may he rest in peace."
4,INTRIGUING,"I loved the book, Ray did a very good job if this a fiction book, makes you wonder? But by the middle of the book I knew kinda already what was going to happen in the end, which was the only part I didn't like. But without giving away anything about the end, some of it just didn't seem to make sense, but very predictable..But still a very intriguing book to read."
3,1 point of view,"You have to take this book as it is. Ray lost his best friend when it was discovered that Jim Morrison was dead in Paris. This story is probably something that he has thought about many times. This story is more of what he would want to be true, what he believes could have been true, then is likely to have happened if in real life Jim had decided to fake his death. When reading this story you have to remember that it is more Ray then it is Jim. i would recommend it definatly but at the same time, it is not the best story."
5,Francesca100,"I bought this book not expecting very much. I got so much more than I expected. Manzarek wrote this under the fairy tail that Jim Morrison was still alive. I found it to be a wonderful story, true or not. If only our dreams could come true like this. It is a beautiful fantasy. I loved it."
4,Really Good Stuff!,"Scott Dreier is that rare breed: a singer who nails it both musically AND dramatically. His vocals are perfect. And the arrangements on this CD are top drawer. Particularly impressive: ""Lida Rose,"" ""Put 'em in a Box."" ""Yesterday,"" and ""Pieces of Dreams."" I love listening to this passionately performed, thoughtfully arranged CD."
5,Over and over...,"...that's how often I listen to this CD. It's absolutely fantastic & is one of those CD's that you can actually listen to from beginning to end...which is rare for me these days. Every song has a different, yet perfect sound. You won't regret buying this CD and listening to it for years to come."
1,Don't Bother,"I find it hard to believe that this my hometown that Kaufmann is writing about. Notice he doesn't even live there. He lives in a town nearby. It's a wonder he wasn't run out of town (maybe he was and that's why he doesn't live in Batavia). I'm sorry but this is not an affetionate tale. Kaufmann obviously has no love for the town. Yes, Batavia has problems but any town or city does and we love them anyway. It's home. Go back to Washington, Mr. Kaufmann."
5,Reactionary radicalism at its finest,"I am a veteran of reading Amazon reviews, but this is the first book that has actually compelled me to write one of my own. DISPATCHES FROM THE MUCKDOG GAZETTE manages to be sweet but not saccharine, loving but not blind, learned but not pedantic, and spot-on 100% right about not just Batavia (which I have visited since reading the book) but about the insidious social and cultural effects of geographic mobility and ""dynamism"" generally. Kauffman has a distinctive voice that makes him one of the most engaging writers working today. Reviewer Mitchell below could not be more wrong (did Kauffman cut him off in traffic or something? was he on the Batavia planning board?). This is a five-star book if ever there was one. Buy it, read it, enjoy it -- and if you don't live near your home, get ready to deal with the guilt."
5,"Funny--Masterful, sly wit delivered simply and practically.","This book is a hoot. After using it to answer mundane questions, (Should you drive or fly? Must we leave now?) dare explore your dreams--Move to Tibet? Texarkana? Will I make my goal of millions by sundown? At board meetings, family roundtables, parties, or as an icebreaker--however we use ""The Book of Answers"", it fuels what may already be in our heads, in our hearts, or at our fingertips. What makes it hilarious, is this book's voice. Bolt has captured wisdom's funnybone."
5,Modern crazy eight ball.,"I love this book. I have purchased 6 of them for various reasons. It is perfect for Graduation gifts, special birthdays, retirement and so much more. My big line is, ""Now you have ALL the answers."" Great fun! It is the modern crazy eight ball of my generation."
3,Dusty...,"A little worn but nevertheless inside it seemed like new. It was at a bargain price. I would recommend that the next time they at least ""dust the books off before sending them""."
2,With all due respect...,"YOu can do the same thing with a Dictionary or a Thesaurus and get a better variety of more poignant answers to boot.IT was, however, a good effort/idea!More power to Ms. Bolt."
3,Fun Book,"I searched and searched for this book in stores, to no avail. I ordered 2 of these books from separate sellers. One came and was in perfect shape. The other had issues, although they were both listed in ""New Condition."" This was very disappointing as they were Christmas gifts.The book is an adult version of ""The eight ball"" from when we were kids. Great fun and a great coffee table book!!!"
5,HA!,I was cataloging it for our collection and I laughed so hard! It is the magic eight ball of books.
4,Good introduction to the sounds of the Arabic language,"This book and the accompanying cassettes will etch the sounds of Arabic into your brain. The lessons were well-organized and the dialogues were very clear and easy to understand; I enjoyed learning them and I began to feel comfortable with the sounds of the Arabic language. It's much better than just learning from a dry textbook.That said, it might not be the best book for beginners. It depends on your goals - are you going to be traveling to the Gulf? If so, go for this book.If not - if you're just starting to learn Arabic, for instance - you might want to start by finding books/cassettes in Modern Standard Arabic as opposed to a dialect. That will serve you better if you plan to take formal courses in Arabic at a future time.However, if you have $50 to spare, this book is not a bad investment."
3,good,"This textbook is good enough to understand the course material. Patterns Plus: Intermediate Reading Practices, 3rd Edition: Building Reading and...You will like it."
4,very good,"I had to erase previous notes but it is very good and useful for helping people who are learning English.,"
2,I hope Not,It may be the Truest $#!@ you ever saidbut not the truest you ever put out. a couple nice tracks but mostly average. C-Murder you got a lot of time on your hands use it wisely. Tighten this $#!@ up Pac came home with a gang of classics in less the time. I know hard comparison but Beanie Seagal came up with some nice hits during his little time away C-Murder well I'll leave it alone 4 now better luck on your appeal and next CD
4,Not bad,"I'm a big fan of Cee-Murdor, and support most Cash Money records, so as soon as this album came out I was quick to download it off the internet. It has a few good original songs like Locked Up and Make Say Ugh, but other songs have questionable production quality, and it sounds like Cee is rapping from a box and not in a studio or something. You'd think that Cash Money sets higher standards than that. Also there isn't much emotion in his voice, and he sounds all depressed. You're a millionaire rapper Cee, you should be happy, there are many other rappers dead (Topac, Biggy) or in jail (Shine), it could be worse...4 stars, would have been 5 except for the echoey production on some songs."
4,free c murder,any one thats a c murder fan should get this album the songs are tight you'll play them all day this is one of the best album he came out with the only thing a bout this album is that he made it in jail and knowing c murder if he wasn't in jail he would made this album better and for y'all haters stop hating and get this album i can't wait til he get out of jail so he can made better albums
1,What?????????,"Ok I read the previous reviews,and I know everyone is entitled to their opinion. But I was very disappointed with this CD. There's only one good song and that's the one that is out..Thank goodness that BG is on there to help that song out . I think Corey just needs to concentrate on surviving in Jefferson Parish. Keep your head up! But stop making music!!!!!!!!!"
3,3 1/2 Stars,"This is an OK album, a few good tracks C dropped on here ""My Life"", ""Stressin"" is ok, ""Yall Heard Of Me"" with BG, ""Camouflage & Murder"" with Mac, and ""Mama How You Figure""..these are the only mentionable tracks on here in my opinion, not the best i've heard from C but he's sittin in prison right now so i wasn't expecting him to be the happiest man in the world on this album so i can excuse him for that, but still although not the best its still worth a listen."
1,c murder's finally free bet you he's gay now,if you like c get this cd but if you think no limit sucks like I do pass it by the millers have a bad habit of making cd's nobody gives a craop about maybe one day the crime familty will play out sinbce romeo's 15 minutes of fame are just about up.
4,review from the Synthesis,"One might think that after receiving a life sentence for second degree murder, C-Murder (southern MC and brother of Master P) might consider a name change. But no, C-Murder is not about to let a little thing like prison change him or stop him from getting his music out to the people. Guest appearances on this disc include longtime partner in rhyme B.G. on the lead single ""Yall Heard of Me,"" the fallen Soulja Slim on ""Holla @ Me"" and Ms. Peaches on the surprisingly deep ""Mama How U Figure."" The production, as one might assume, is pretty shoddy; the vocal levels are off and the remake of Akon's ""Locked Up"" (disguised as ""Won't Let Me Out""), while quite appropriate, is no match for the original. As raw and grimy as he wants to be, C-Murder has grown, and his troubles have given him a new perspective, which is reflected on the album.- Katie PattersonSynthesis.net"
5,"Fast delivery, great product, thanks!","This product arrived fast and works great, we use this to run a communications app for programming parking meters. Thanks!"
2,CRASHES OFTEN..,I just had this thing for a few hours.. and it has crashed 3 times with a fatal exception each time requiring a hardware reset.. First time it synchs properly with the t610 second time onwards has a bunch of errors..
2,Keep the CD in a safe place and re-learn graffiti,"This Palm uses a new flavor of Grafitti, which is giving me fits. There's no way to use the old version.The installation CD is essential if you ever need to reinstall the software. I had a system crash, and though I could get the desktop software from the Palm web site, I could not reinstall the Outlook-synchronization conduit. To do this, you must have the original CD, which I've lost. Palm wants $25 just to talk to tech support and more $$$ to get a copy of the installation CD. You cannot get a CD via email tech support."
2,Customer Dis-Service,"The Palm unit doesn't feel very solidly put together, more so when the 4 small screws in the side pop out. God forbid that you try to get the screws from Palm though. It's $25 per phone call if the palm is older than 90 days. I was told to call 3 different numbers (no one is able to transfer calls it sees), and was eventually told Palm will, under no circumstance, provide me with screws. I *could* ship it back on my own dime to have them install the screws for me. They also said that they just had a meeting about screws the day before to solidfy this ""no-screw"" policy. This tells me the screw issue is probably pretty common. Now my expensive machine is at risk because of a nickle's worth of hardware. Nice PDA, TERRIBLE customer service!!!"
1,Junk,"I have now spent 7 hours searching the Palm help database, and speaking to customer service. Nothing is helping to have the Palm sync to my computer. My wife's T3 syncs fine to both hers and mine. My new T3 won't connect at all and the customer service guy told me to call Microsoft.I also agree with a previous post that Palm should give clear instructions for upgrading. I only stumbled upon the instructions buried in the Palm support pages. Too late though... I already installed the software.I will go back to my M515 and return my T3. I just don't want to be around when my wife's T3 starts to die.Customer service is not nice people trying to help... it is providing reliable products!"
3,Great but be careful!,"The T3 is a wonderful device. However, software developers have not adjusted their programs yet for the T3's screen so there are limited programs for it at this time. Also, many users have reported that the T3 destroys sd cards, notably san disk. Owners must be aware that if they buy the T3 and also purchase an sd card there is a good chance they will destroy their sd card until Palmone releases some fix for this problem."
4,Palm Tungsten T3,"the tungsten t3 was a little more than i had originally thought. it has better graphics for playing games than anticipated. although you may not hotsync many games, the ability is there with the expansion card. the music player is awesome if you have an SD Card that is loaded with music. all in all i would have to say that the purchase of the t3 was defineately a wise decision. you cannot hotsync it with a vista64 operating system, but XP home is just as good and there are multiple places on the internet to find software to download and use for it."
1,not happy with it,i bought item and it was not as discribed it was very very aged not happy with it it was packed good but other than that not happy with discription.
5,Utterly fantastic!,"I love this little fella! The pictures are sharp, the input in graffiti is very easy and the overall organization is a delight."
5,Fantastic handheld,"This is a fantastic handheld device. The T3 has amazing features and the most beautiful screen I've seen on a handheld. If you are considering a T3 versus a Pocket PC and can do a side by side comparison, you'll be surprised at how much better the T3's screen is. Pocket PCs look grainy in comparison. The T3 is fast, well made, and well worth the price. I'm thrilled with mine."
1,Do not buy this junk from this unreliable company,"After one week the screen doesn't work, the back plate is loose, and the nice Indian gentlemen who answer your calls tell you that PalmOne will not give you a new Tungsten T3 to replace the lemon you received from them. The concept of this handheld is wonderful, but the shoddy manufacture and the stiff arm from the manufacturer make this an utterly unacceptable alternative. Not only would I recommend that you steer clear of the T3, but I also recommend that you steer clear of PalmOne. Their name should be PalmNothing."
1,Crashes on a whim,"I was thrilled when I first bought it. Not anymore! This thing crashes (soft reset) with 75% of the third party apps that I installed (20 of 25). I have tried 320x320, 320x480, even 160x160 color apps with no luck. All of the programs load and launch ok. Some crash shortly after launch while most crash instantly when you try to select the menu icon for the program. You would think that Palm would make sure that the majority of 3rd party apps would be backward compatible. Seriously, I have never had a palm unit that crashed as much as this thing.The screen also seems to have little brightness adjustment. I started all the way to the right and didn't notice a change in brightness until I was 3/4 of the way to the left. I feel that the T3 is not ready for prime time and shouldn't have been released until they had all the bugs worked out. If any palm needed an update patch it's this one. Steer clear and if you need a palm right away go for the T2."
1,Mine Died,My Tungsten T# just died. It is in a forzen state. It will not reboot or even turn off. It is just over a year old and I am now looking for a new PDA.
1,Be cautious!,I read all the reviews and tried my luck anyway. I had my T3 out of the box for 6 hours before it died! Went through the manuals and couldn't find any help. I just decided to give up on Palm and try a different product completely.
1,Disappointed,I am disappointed. order this product on the 4th with a delivery date in two to three days. zIn time for a birthday present..My order is being shipped on the 14th.. too late.. I tried to cancel order.. there is not way to cancel..Very Upsetthe way this order is being handled.
1,See-through thin!!!,"I am sure that these breeches are very cool, but in white (I bought them for a dressage show) they are so thin as to be transparent! I can literally see the color of my skin, not to mention my underwear, through them. I imagine in black or another dark color they would be fine, but be forewarned if you want them in white! I can't imagine wearing them to a show or anywhere else. Obviously, I'm returning them."
3,"Okay, but hard for beginners","There are very few books available to teach the Armenian language to adults. This book's main strength lies in the fact that if you manage to complete it, you will acquire a substantial Armenian vocabulary. The downsides of the book, however, are a much too glib chapter on the challenging Armenian alphabet, too few reading exercises (almost none, really), and a grammatical/structural organization that is rather a baffling way to organize such a book. A more ""inductive"" language book on Armenian needs to be written, but until then this is a good, not great, introduction to this fascinating language."
3,trying hard,"It would be very advantageous if a similar book was available using Eastern Armenian, the differences are enough to make it difficult for someone from Yerevan.However, a good base marker."
1,"Beginner's Armenian, by Hagop Andonian",Not at all for beginners. It's probably a good reference for an advanced student.
1,beginners Armenian,"Totally useless for my purposes. It does not indicate whether it is Eastern or western Armenian, the Armnenian type is MUCH too small and VERY difficult to read, no indication of pronuciation, and no accent marks to indicate where the stress falls on the syllables. Armenian script should be much clearer and bigger for beginners."
2,Terrible Mixing and Production,"Loudness is one of my top 5 favorite bands. Just brought this Cd, very disappointed with the sound mixing. Most of the time I cannot hear the singer's voice. The Cd sound like someone used a cassette recorder to tape the concert. Very very disappointed."
5,The Best cookbook EVER,Never before have I enjoyed a cookbook as much as The Cooks Bible. At last perfect stir-fry! Perfect bread! Perfect vegetables! This is one cookbook I would be lost without!
2,Item Received Not As Pictured,"The content of the book I received was the same as the one purchased, but it was like getting a mass-market copy of a hardcover book. It had a different cover, no dust jacket, and inferior paper quality and ink when compared to the copy I already owned. I purchased this as a gift but am honestly embarassed to give it away. On the otherhand, Kimball is still one of the best out there for explaining the how and why of cooking."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is a book that just doesn't deliver. It reads well and gives the impression that everything will work - well everything doesn't. Things that do work are mediocre and things that don't work, really don't work, just try the pie crust and you'll see what I mean. A good concept, interesting to read, just don't cook from it."
3,OK but...,The size and ability to hang on the wall is wonderful.The reception is not nearly as good as other radios I have in the same location.The sound quality also is ok but not dynamic compared to other radios I have that are small.For the price it does the job I need.
5,Really helpful,"This is a great overview to the investment banking industry, and I found it to be extremely current as well, given all the recent layoffs on Wall Street. The profiles of the major firms are helpful, if brief, and the details around the key types of jobs are rich and well researched. I really liked the day-in-a-life profiles. Definitely recommend this book to those looking to research careers in i-banking."
2,disappointing,This report was disappointing. A more useful report on IBanking is the Vault.com 2002 Career Guide to Investment Banking or the Harvard guide to finance careers.
5,Hope is Eternal!,"This is a wonderful story. It brought forward all the fears, and struggles we all have in our relationships with other races. But as we accept, with all our hearts the real person, the soul of another being, our love grows and expands. Our circle of family expands, and then hope really can spring eternal. If Cassie can accept the chalenges, so can we. Great little story, would love to hear more from this author!!! We need more stories that are uplifting, and to beable to read a book with out foul language or vile sexual content, is wonderful. I could recommend this book to any one, of any age, or race."
3,A little Disappointed,An OK cookbook. There are others I liked much better. All the Weight Watcher cookbooks for example. Most likely I will only cook only a few of the recipes in this cookbook.
3,solid sound.,"solid sounding trumpet parts, but not very interesting musically. he doesn't go anywhere with it. was he thinking domo oragoto mr. roboto?"
2,Not the Usual from This Author,"This book was readable but just barely. I suppose I'm comparing it to every other book I've ever read by this author. I've never read a book by Debbie Macomber that I didn't fall in love with. This one was predictable and boring, or maybe I'm just tired of the books where the man and woman hate each other's guts and then manage to fall madly in love at the end."
3,Wyoming Kid,I thought the book was slow reading and far from Macomber's better books. I would recommend just because it is a Macomber book but warn my feelings.
3,Wyomingkid,I would prefer a brief preview before purchasing to ensure that I have not already read or purchased the book.
5,Christmas has come a lttle early,"I have been waiting for over five years for Dragnet 1968 to be released. When I saw it on Amazon a few months ago I had to pre order it. It arrived today, and it feels like I'm a little boy at Christmas. The DVD has crisp clean video quality, and no more two sided DVD's to put episodes on each side like Universal did with the first release. Thank You Shout Factory for bringing back shows from my youth. I will be looking for other Dragnet releases in the future."
5,Nostalgia... those were the days!,"Love watching Dragnet and catching things like - prices of homes, gas and food prices, and what people made. And seeing todays actors when they were kids!! It's fun, we love Dragnet and the oldies!!"
3,Not as good as Smith's book,"If you really want a failsafe way to see the aura, I recommend Mark Smith's book ""Auras- See Them In Just 60 Seconds"". It's also on Llewellyn, and is more entertaining as well. Webster's book isn't bad, it's just not in the same class as Smith's."
4,interesting,"I'ts very interesting on how to see your aura, even the exercises are easy to do. Have done a couple of them and was amazed by the results."
2,"It works, but...","Yes, the tips in this book DO help you to see auras. Let me make it easy for you. Cross your eyes for a second and look above someones head. Tah Dah!! Is that an aura? Okay, let's say it is.My issue with the book is that it also presented other ""paranormal"" actives which have been disproved, as fact. ie. dowsing.Do yourself a favor. Before reading/buying this book read something by The Amazing Randy."
2,Poorly Written,"All of the great reviews must have come from the authors friends and relatives. I tried to do some research on the author but found very little, if any, on the internet. I should have suspected something was up at that point! Nevertheless I slogged my way through the book cover to cover and it was very difficult to read. Some of the flaws are as follows: Characters come into the book with little or no historical context, the author constantly repeats himself, there is little or no organization to the authors book. You get the feeling he did an immense amount of research and just compiled his notes with no thought of how it would read. The sad part is this could have been a great book considering the subject matter, characters and events surrounding Quantrills life. I am beginning to see that many of the reviews on Amazon cannot be taken seriously."
2,I expected more and would have liked to see only a few kids instead of a large group.,I was not happy with this video. I was hoping for the instructor to be more descriptive of each exercise she presented and I would have like to see kids that knew what they were doing. It was a waste of money.
2,SpamKiller 5 is not an upgrade,"SpamKiller 4 is much better. I promptly reinstalled it after trying 5.0. SpamKiller 5 doesn't run in the system tray and doesn't notify you when your receive new email. The interface looks nicer but is slower and less functional. Recommend getting SpamKiller 4 while it's still available. (Update: One person told me they liked Norton AntiSpam, but all the reviews say it's buggy and slow, so I wouldn't recommend it over SpamKiller 4.)"
1,"buggy, slow,","very disappointed. buggy, slow and in the bottom 10% of spam trapping. worse yet filters are not updated regularly.Mcaffee customer support is the worst."
3,Cute,"None of the Casper movies that came after CASPER(starring Bill Pulman and Christina Ricci)are as good,but this is still cute.Casper the Friendly Ghost meets Wendy the Good Little Witch,and they form a friendship.(There is a wicked wizard called somebody Spellman in this and I figure he must be a relative of Sabrina..??)"
1,The worst part of the Casper saga.,"I was realy enjoying the Casper saga. Up until now that is. This movie lacks humor, fun, adventure, decent special effects, and a story. I DO NOT RECOMEND AT ALL! DO NOT BUY!"
2,Fun for kids; barely tolerable for adults,"I bought this film thinking it would be fun for the whole family. It's a kids film with a talented cast. What could go wrong? Well, the script and the direction. The story is kind of cute, but the script and direction are unbearable for anyone over 10! I'm giving it two stars because I think it deserves one and my daughter thinks it deserves four."
1,"Fun, but ultimately irrelevant addition to the Casper saga","It's a shame that the makers of Casper movies have apparently decided to release all the new episodes straight to video. In this case, the standard the creators set for their work is clearly way too low; the result is a terribly straightforward, disappointing tale that is usually funny and full of hilarious wordplays but totally lacks any hidden meanings or subtlety that almost seemed to have become a trademark of the series after the first two movies. The series seems to have become somewhat exhausted, and the creators seem to desperately lack new ideas. Consequently, the third movie looks too much like a the first one, only not as inspired. If the Casper legacy is to continue in the future, it absolutely needs to go in some new direction, because the old one is clearly not enough at this point."
4,Who sings the title song,"My kids love this movie, friendly-scary (if at all scary). One question, if anyone is reading this, who is the singer of the title song."
5,hilary duff rules!!!!!!!!!!,"this is a grrrrrrreat movie! she's a wonderful actress!!! and do NOT listen to the other review that says she stinks, because she rocks! she is a very successful young actress and is admired by millions. she rox!"
3,alright,"For one thing all of the casper movies were not bad films although, im afraid this one is the best. Hilary duff did a good job as Wendy, but to really see her acting skills and her good looks you have to watch the show Lizzie McGuire. Casper meets Wendy is not one to go wild over, but still its pretty good."
4,eye candy--awesome,"Loved this film...The director gave this story so much color and excitiment....So many favorite performances....would love to see more of that hunk the social director..Larry Tallby..""Rodger Halston""...very funny movie and cast.....a must for the entire family."
4,Nice movie.,Cute movie starring Hilary Duff as a little kid. My daughter LOVES it and has watched it several times already.
1,No Security Lock,This lock does not provide any security. My bicycle was stolen in broad daylight from outside my office building. Apparently any thief can buy this same lock at the store and unlock your lock with the key. Bright colored coating draws attention to your bike to make it easy to be stolen this way. I now lock my new bike with a kryptonite U lock!
1,Too Easy to Cut,"I bought these cables knowing they were too thin for locking a bike in a dangerous area, but I thought my bikes would be safe on my front porch. WRONG! All three were cut by someone in the middle of the day, costing me a lot of money to replace the bikes, and forever giving my spouse ammunition to use against me. My family has lived in the house for 40 years. We have had bikes stolen off the front porch before, so I wasn't kidding myself about neighborhood safety. But I did hope the cables would have a deterrent effect. Now, I'm shopping for stronger cables. SIGH."
1,P.O.S.,This product lasted one night before somebody came by and smashed it with a hammer and stole my bike. Should have know better than to use a product that could be cut with standard garden shears.
2,8mm not 10mm as advertised,"Just received and found its 8mm not 10mm as advertised. Right on the back of the cardboard box it says 6' (1.8m) , 5/16"" (8mm) diameter. These look much thinner than my 10mm cable. Needless to say these will be going back. I gave 2 stars as problem is with Amazon description and not necessarily a fault of the item."
5,Work great!,They serve thier purpose! VERY nice to have the same key go to all the locks. Price was right and got here quickly.
5,Really nice set and great to have all keyed the same,"The set workes very well. It coils on the frame and isn't too heavy. My wife, son, and I all bike together and we only need to find one key. If one of us forgets their key, we can use one of the others. Great for the price. Haven't had any issues."
5,Great product for the money,I didn't want to invest in anything too expensive for mine and my children's bicycles so I figured I'd give this 3-pack a shot. With one universal key (you get multiples but they are interchangeable) for all three it's super convenient. They work great with no defects and the colors are vibrant. A great value.
4,Great package deal!,"I bought these locks for my kids to use at school. They are a nice looking and functional way to secure school bikes. I particularly like the interchangeable keys. The new rule in our house is ""if you loose your key, don't call home, find your brother"". They work fine, even my 6-year old can lock and unlock his bike.I almost didn't buy these because of the comments about cable size here on Amazon. If you have some zillion dollar bike you probably want a thicker stronger cable, maybe with GPS tracking and some of those dye-packs that tellers throw in with the cash in bank robberies. These locks are extremely strong, no one is going to break them without serious bike-theft tools. They will certainly deter any but the most ambitious, professional and prepared thief."
4,Good deal. Ease of use.,"My son wanted something to give him some peace of mind when he goes to his friends on his new bike. I saw this 3-pack set and thought it was a good deal.To use this product, all you have to do is wrap the chain around the bike and a post. There are 3 chains and 3 keys; Any of the keys will work with the three chains so it doesn't matter if you accidentally mixed them up. The chains are wrapped in plastic hose tubes in 3 different colors. The hoses cover the bare chains to prevent scratching the paint of his new bike.One thing to bear in mind. This is not a foolproof way of protecting your bike. Any determined thief who has the right tools will have no problem taking your bike. But if he has a choice and see your bike with a chain on it, he will probably pass on to the next bike for an easier ride. Also, most of the times, it just another kid who wants to swipe your bike for a joy ride in the neighborhood and leave it in middle of the park."
1,Bike stolen,"On the 2nd day I parked my bike at the metro north station, it was stolen. I purchased the bike from Target less than a week ago. This lock is too easy for the thieves!"
5,Good locks.,"Sturdy locks, I can't complain!The keys aren't horrible, either. I use two of the three that I received, for extra security. A big bonus is that they match the colors of my bike."
1,Stolen Bikes,Brand new bikes interlocked to steel pipe - woven thru the frame and wheels with these 3 cable locks - and they cut all 3 and stole the bikes. Had the bikes less than 2 weeks. I'm not happy. These locks SUCK
4,Review,These were just as expected and work very well. The cables hold form well but are also easy to expand when needed
5,Great price,"We have two bikes that we needed locks for, so having an extra lock, especially for the price seemed like a great idea. Little did we know that there would be a ""bike bandit"" in our building a month later that would try to saw through the lock and steal one of our bikes. He had already stolen 4-5 other bikes, but apparently this lock was good enough to make him take so much time that he got caught! He was only using a (admittedly large) kitchen knife, but seeing the work he put into it, I'm happy with my purchase.Also, if anyone needs a half-sawed-through red cable lock... :)"
3,A decent collection,"A decent collection of 16 hits that focuses on the John Payne years. Asia re-recorded ""Heat of the Moment"" and ""Only Time Will Tell"" to reflect the sound of their new singer (and for legal reasons). Jeff Downes even dusted off an old track from GTR called ""The Hunter"". Included as part of the special edition is an acoustic version of ""Time Again"". However, as good as Payne is, I've always been a Wetton fan."
1,AAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!,JOHN PAYNE WITH A KARAOKE MACHINE!!!!!!!!! MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!AVOID THIS ALBUM AT ALL COSTS!!
5,Awwwww...,"I have had a heck of a time finding this book in decent shape enough to have laying around to read to my new, first grandbaby. To find it n Amazon, and SO CHEAP was once, again amazing!!! Looking foward to many, many nights snuggling with the little ones, reading the same book I read to her mommy almost 20 years ago....."
4,The Incognito Return of the Octave Doctors...,"When I first heard YOU, I thought it was the most odd and brilliant record I'd ever heard. It is the final act of a hippie-esque ""smoke opera"" that takes the now-venerable jam-band flights of trippy fantasy to new and dizzy heights. More akin to Ozric Tentacles than to the Grateful Dead, the tunes on this disc are challenging, mesemerising, and ultimately quite satisfying.Steer clear if you're attached to traditional song dynamics, 2:45 bits of pop structure, or made nervous by music that carries you away.Not a perfect album, but well worth the time and attention of the adventurous listener."
2,Over priced and Underperformed,There are lots of better microphones on the market for lower price.Over rated as a communications microphone.
1,"Ho Hum, Next!","Starting from the first track, this CD never seems to gain momentum and despite an all-star lineup and great musicianship, It just FAILS.... Another great ideal, with poor execution. Pass this one up...unless you are part of the Prince Cult. (definately a 1/2 star if it were possible)"
2,"A bit sirupy, funky, and just so-so!","Despite having such great vocalists as Holly Cole (Purple Rain, The Question of U)), Cassandra Wilson (When Doves Cry), Phil Perry (Diamonds and Pearls), Jimi Tunnel (Kiss, Baby I'm a Star), Tsiidi Le Loka (Nothing Compares 2 U), Loris Diran (Little Red Corvette), and jazz instrumentalists Greg Osby, Everette Harp, Benny Green, along with a host other jazz idioms, this CD just never seems to get off the ground."
4,Helpful Overview,"It was helpful to get an overview of each topic that Augustine wrote and thought about. Though expansive in topics it is not deep in many topics. Some of the articles were not very helpful. Overall, many topics were quite helpful and it is worth the money spent for an excellent resource."
2,HORIBLE!!!!,This is NOT a good lego! Don't buy it! It breaks all the time and the price is way to high for such a bad lego. It falls apart when you build it AND when you play with it. But the pieces are pretty cool...
3,How bad can legos get?,"Slave 1 is an extremely bad set. It costs you [$$$], plus it doesn't hold together. It is not very fun to play with, plus it is extremely heavy. I highly disrecomend this set to everyone."
1,Awful Lego,"This is a horrible lego. Do not get it unless you are willing to take hundreds of hours to put it together. The durability is very bad. If you are looking for legos to play with, do not get this one. It falls apart very easily. It is the worst lego I have ever put together and I have had legos all my life."
4,kamino escape!,"THIS SET IS VERY NEAT. FIRST, THERE IS A SECRET COMPARTMENT WERE YOU CAN PUT SIESMIC CHARGES. THEN THERE'S A REMOVEABLE PRISON CELL WITH A TRANSPERANT DOOR, AND ROTATING LASERS. AND IT HAS A FLAP WITH PROJETILE LAUCHERS ON THEM. PLUS, THE WINGS ROTATE. YOU WILL GET YOUNG BOBA FETT AND JANGO FETT. YOU CAN TAKE OFF JANGO'S HELMET AND TURN HIS HEAD AROUND TO REVEAL HIS FACE."
5,sooooooooooooo cooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is so cool. I got this for Christmas. It's also very durable. I dropped it and only 2 pieces came of! It took me about 45mins to build. I also found somthing wrong. When you look in the back of the ship above where the prison compartment is there is a hole where you can see 1-2 of the mini-figs in the place where Jango and Boba control the ship and if there was a hole when they were flying in space they would die. The cool thing is that the rotating laser cannons don't slouch down like other LEGO products. I'm also a LEGO CLUB member. This is a must have for Lego fans. I recomend this to everybody who loves lego,Lego Technic,or lego bionicle. So hurry up and get it where ever. It's size makes old Slave 1 a tiny green and gray lump. Get the Jedi Starfighter to challenge it in the astroid field. If you don't get it you'll be sorry!!!!!! (It also costs you $$$!)"
4,Jango Fett's awsome ship is now for Lego!,"This is the best Episode II set I've seen in my Lego ruled life! It has a great educational value because 1) It is difficult to build 2) Is rewarding to finish 3) Shows what you can accomplish with your hands 4) It's size and durability teaches responsibilty for things you own! It is fun to fly around with its moving parts and opening hatches! This is my first Episode II set I've got, and not the last!!!"
3,Cooder aint up to par...,"Its a good cd, if you like the music. It may not be what you are used to. Listen to the audio clips. Nice slide guitar playing. Personally, i think Ry Cooder gets killed on this one, the blues licks just seem a little crude and basic compared to V.M. Bhatts licks...granted, he's more used to the style of music."
3,Toure collaboration is better,"I accidently bought this album thinking it was the Ali Farka Toure collaboration, which I had heard before and loved. This one was a little bit of a let-down. There are only four songs, and only one of them could I really distinguish from the others, Ganges Delta Blues. The album is a little short in play time, and a little short on imagination. Ry is a master of understatement with the guitar, and his playing just can't be heard or affect in any way Bhatt's music. It's a ""Meeting by the River"" alright, but these two fellas jumped in together for a swim and I'm afraid poor Ry drowned."
5,"Beautiful music, topnotch recording",Most people will know Ry Cooder from a career full of interesting musical endeavors. The other muscians are no less talented and the recording is so detailed you could recreate the fingerprints of the two drummers as their hands add rythmic texture on the stretched skins. Cooder adapts so well to his partner's playing that there are times when it is impossible to distinguish Cooder's slide guitar from the traditional Indian Mohan Vina played by V.S.Bhatt. Altogther a lovely relaxing set of original tunes on a perfectly recorded CD that will sooth even the most savage of beasts.
1,Dissappointed,This cd was so dissappointing. It is getting more difficult to buy something that really lives up to it's description.
5,Irwins wonderful sculptured garden at the Getty Center,"This bok is a revelation of the landscaped sculptured garden by an "" abstract expressionist"""
2,Say What?!?!,"I find this book full of useless information that makes no sense whatsoever. This Dr is a resident in the area of where I live, so I decided to pick it up and read it. It is full of typos, and has several mistakes in it. Plus, I find it very difficult to follow along. His ""patients"" that he refers to in the book seem fabricated to me. If you want to know what the jist of the book and his diet is; 1. only protien for breakfast 2. complex carbs for lunch 3. eat what you would like for dinner. Oh and stay away from alcohol and sweets and white rice and pasta. There ya have it. Save yourself $20."
3,I Disagree!,"The only visible reviewer did not think this a good program. They said it did everything for you. Sure! If you don't TURN OFF the Auto Play! It's not the best or the most complete Solitare program available, I have several ""larger-fuller"" ones myself, but this compact program is very well done for the money. I find I gravitate to it more frequently than the more ""exotic"" programs of Solitare that I also have installed. It looks and plays very well for the money!"
5,Essential work from the inventor of Rap,"Before rap music had a name, Melvin Van Peebles was a pioneer of the form in the late '60s, when he released BRER SOUL, AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH and AS SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK on A&M Records. With GHETTO GOTHIC, Melvin's tunes are enhanced by an instrumental background which makes the scenes he creates more vivid than ever. ""The Apple Stretching"" is as good of a picture of everyday life in New York City as you can find, and listening to it is truly uplifting. ""Lily"" is a hip-hop remake of his '60s classic, which is also true of ""It Just Don't Make No Sense."" ""There"" contains a melodic undercurrent that will stick in your mind forever. The mark of a great innovator is that his work seems as 'cutting edge' today as it was in the beginning. Give GHETTO GOTHIC a spin and see what I mean. Then let's hope all of his vintage albums get a domestic reissue."
3,Uneven debut novel..shows promise,"David Ambrose's first novel ""The Man who turned into himself"" is interesting and works on the premise of the Many Worlds theory of Quantum physics. I love the way Ambrose opens up the possiblities of our strange universe, but I hate how choppy the writing seems at times, and I felt the characters were too unreal."
3,Nice as psychological study. Lousy as physics.,"I was enjoying this book as clever psychological fiction and willing to give the author a pass on his somewhat lame use of the Many Worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics as the central plot device. Then he hit me on a pet peeve: science misinformation so dumb that it undercuts the credibility of the whole story. Mid-way through the story, the protagonist ""demonstrates"" the famous two-slit interference experiment with a flashlight and holes cut in a piece of cardboard. Ouch. I hate when an author bases a story on some scientific idea and then makes an error so outrageous that it shows they have no idea what they are talking about. It makes it very difficult to maintain the willing suspension of disbelief upon which engaging drama depends. To the author: please learn some physics before writing about it. To the readers: skip the science and enjoy the story for the multiple-selves character study."
3,In a word: weird,"I first read this book when I was twelve or thirteen years old. I suppose I was too young to fully appreciate and understand it. At any rate, it spooked me. It opened a new door that I never even knew was there. My perception of reality was completely thrown out of balance and I lay in bed shaking at night, wondering if I could ever be normal again. Now that I think about it, it is a rather silly story, but a thirteen year old doesn't necessarily see it that way. This book is good, but I don't recommend it to young preteens who have just grasped the idea that their understanding of reality is not necessarily the only one, but don't know how to handle that idea. It will reduce them to tears if they are not any stronger than I am."
1,A waste of time,"At first, I was fascinated, by the title, by the premise, it all seemed like an excellent story idea. Unfortunately, that was before I read it. Until the end, I was willing to give the author a little credit, thinking the premise was something a little different than it is. But then, he takes this rediculously egotistical stand (I thought there was going to be something like, ""How do we know crazy people really are crazy? Maybe it's us."" But it turns out, the main character is the only one who isn't crazy (at least, in the author's opinion)."
3,GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE,"Ambrose's ""Man Who Turned Into Himself"" is a well-written work, that can't be denied. However, there is so much scientific malarky that makes so little sense that in the end you can't fully appreciate the novel. By the time book ends, we're not really sure just what happened. At least I wasn't. Could have been a fascinating read, but I recommend it only for Ambrose's technical skills.CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED."
2,"Good movie, poor transfer to DVD","As other reviews note, this film focuses on the love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere and how their love, aided by Mordred's desires to be king, destroys Camelot. This version put out by Platinum is a poor transfer to DVD with colors, brightness and sound quality fluctuating throughout the film."
2,Neither Flynn nor Havilland,"Mr and Mrs Wilde (Jean Wallace) suffer a lot, but all their suffering does not touch the heart. Mr Wilde is perhaps too old for this part and uses terrible intonations. Brian Ahearne as a King is very good. Fights are good with a lot of fighters. I recommend Flynn and Taylor epics instead of this. It is not bad, but something is lacking."
5,quality product,this album holds dvds and cds. very durable and efficient. great product--very pleased with purchase.
4,DVD and CD Carrying Case,"I really like this product. Yesterday, I organized all of my DVD's in this carrying case, and I still have plenty of room left to sort out my CD's. The only drawback is that it is bulky and unwieldy, but it is still an excellent purchase. All of those plastic jewel cases, many with cracked lids, are in a garbage bag waiting for the trash pick up."
4,Big and Bad!,It's huge I thought I would never find a CD case big enough for all my CDs but here it is for an affordable price! Great for travel carries all your CDs in a small space if you are a DJ then this is the holder for you!
5,Fellowes CD Wallets,"I was alittle reluctant about taking all of my CD's and putting them in books instead of their cases. This turned out absolutely awesome. I was able to get rid of over 500 jewel cases and now have all this extra room on my shelves. These books take up virtually no space compared to all of the jewel cases I had. And now I don't have to dust those cases. Also, my collection is now in alphabeticial order.""I Love It"""
1,too many Cds,i only have 20 CDs and the holder holds 300 more so it looks empty if you open it from the back.
2,Moderately useful,"When I got my Fellowes 320 CD case in the mail, I was very pleased. I spent an hour loading all of my CD's into it. I showed it off to my friends, all of whom admired the stylish look and professional features. That is, until the stitching holding the handle on came loose two days later, leaving the handle attached at only one end. To top that off, a day after that, the zipper's stitching came loose as well, meaning that not only was I left with a CD case that I couldn't pick up easily, but now it couldn't close either. How utterly delightful."
2,Huge case but inferior to caselogic,"I just bought this case about 2 weeks ago and after loading it up, it is just waiting to break. The handle is not reinforced nearly enough, and, although plentiful, the cheap attachement of the pages within the case is going to be a problem. If your csae pretty much just stays in the house and lives an easy life than this mammoth case is for you, but if you are like me and your case goes out and about to see the world then I am telling you to go with the case logic. This case was put together cheap."
4,Fellows CD Wallet,"At first I couldn't wait to get this. I ordered 2 at the same time. As I started to fill the pages, I started seeing the first of several problems. Pockets were tight and it would be very easy to scratch a dvd on the zipper. Speaking of zipper, it is very hard to work when the wallet is full. The other day, I wanted to see about getting more CD wallets (not necessarily Fellows) when I read the reviews here for this wallet. I read the part about not putting cd's in the inner pockets because they would bend. I went home and checked mine. Sure enough, when the wallet is full, the cd's are slightly bent. I would imagine if they were left that way for a period of time, they would probably stay curved."
5,Excellent choice,This case is super durable and sits very nice on a book shelf. Great portability too with its sturdy handle.
5,This is the second one I buy!,"...so I guess I liked it! So far it has worked great for my needs. It is simple, holds a lot of CDs, it stand well on the shelves and is sturdy... just what I needed ."
5,FRAN LANDESMAN is alive and well...,"...and being done well by her composer SIMON WALLACE and sung beautifully by NICKI LEIGHTON-THOMAS. If you are interested in jazz, lyrics, poetry, rapture, dissolution, recovery, redemption, empathy and the possibility of true love get this album into your ears and heart by any means necessary. I hunted for my copy for over two years and wasn't disappointed. I listen to this album at least monthly even though I know the songs by heart.If you don't know FRAN LANDESMAN's work- THE BALLAD OF THE SAD YOUNG MEN and SPRING CAN REALLY HANG YOU UP THE MOST are songs she wrote in the early 1950s with Tommy WOLF- well, kind of think Dorothy Parker but with less bile and more actual humor.Nicki Leighton-Thomas has a lovely voice and knows how to use to make these lovely songs shine. I wish she'd record another but so far, this album is it. If you care to, you can download the album or at least SCARS and DOWN."
5,Nice replacement fan,Bought this because the factory fan quit. It was cheap and could be shipped next day Amazon Prime. Only downside I saw is that it takes up adjacent card slot. The asymmetric shape allowed it to fit better. Mounting was easy although I used Arctic Silver Ceramique rather than the supplied heat-sink grease.
1,Totally Dissatisfied!,"Since June of 2009, I have been waiting to receive my book. I have made several attempts to the seller to resolve the issue. To this point, no resolution has been made. I will never order from this seller again because (1) they are not willing to work with you, nor (2)willing to resolve the matter of the book. I had to order another book which caused an inconvenience for me."
5,A highly enjoyable mix of education and entertainment,"Enhanced with line drawn illustrations by Chao Yu and Jue Wange, A Penny For Albert by Gerri Cook is a thoroughly delightful book for young readers about a girl who looking for a story for her TV show ""Weird Science,"" and becomes caught up in a whirlwind discovery friendship with a toothy yet remarkable dinosaur named Albert. A Penny For Albert is a highly enjoyable mix of education and entertainment which can be enthusiastically recommended as a superb book for young dinosaur fans."
1,Repair???,"Picked this up to try out because of the ratings & price. Didn't do a thing for me. Wipe it on, let it haze and wipe it off. No difference."
1,moronic and archaic.,"I thought that, despite it's age, this book might have some amusing or usefully harmless ideas. It's worse than merely useless and moronic. Not only are most of the concepts worthless and dated, the author made the unpardonable sin of making it monotonously dated by constantly taking swipes at Ronald Reagan on every other page. It's like reading a book about revenge written by a college freshman who hated Herbert Hoover. ""A good way to stick it to the Hoover-ites is, when you get on the trolley on the way to the silent picture show, pass gas and blame the old lady next to you! That's the cat's pajamas!"" ""Another way to frustrate the Hoover administration is, when the milk man comes by, feed his horse straw instead of hay!"" ""If you really hate Herbert Hoover, crouch down behind your mark's radio cabinet, and when Amos and Andy comes on, bark like a dog and set fire to his curtains!"" You get the picture."
5,Must-have Book for any Art Library,"Oh this is a fabulous book. My first copy was bought on a whim. Someone 'borrowed' it and it was missing from my stash of art inspiration books. I found myself constantly wishing I had this book (unlike others in my collection that I sometimes rediscover and then forget about again)! So, I reordered this. I am so happy to have it back! (Good speedy service from Amazon too). What a treat to get into the mind of such a talented artist. It's like having a chat w/a genius each time you open it. He describes what inspired him and any thoughts about the painting. The picture quality is superb. This is an amazing book to see the breadth and scope of a master's body of work."
5,excellent,This book which is truly autobiographical is a must have for Wyeth lovers. I am a photographer and find his compositions very interesting and learnt a lot about his approach to painting. A beautiful book.
5,Bonds of Love,This is one of my all time favorites. I would like to read more work like this. It has a great story line and I really enjoy Kathryn and the Captain. I would recommend this book anytime. It's a keeper!
1,Get something else...only lasted 6 months...,"Purchased this product 6 months ago for about $75 from the local walmart... worked fine for a while, then it started making a very loud noise while playing dvd's... sort of sounded like a helicoptor in the distance. Lets face it, this product is cheap! Don't believe me, wait till you get it out of the box. The 5 dvd trays feel like they are going to break just using them. The back connector plate is made of plastic and looks cheap... because it is. Unfortunately the products price isn't cheap, at least in my opinion $75 for 6 months of use ins't cheap. Eventually the loud noise became worse and it stopped reading discs all together... get something else. Good luck."
1,Not Recommended,Ordered as a Christmas gift. Charger has not worked since the product was first opened. One week later it would not play any music. Customer service was very responsive and agreed to a full refund.5 stars for the customer service0 stars on the product
2,lame,"I had never seen the movie before, and I thought it was kind of lame. The acting wasn't very good in it. I can't complain about the price, though, because I only paid a couple bucks for it. It was sent quickly, though, and the video was in good shape."
3,"Baio in ""Dumb Luck""????","Scott Baio and Hal Linden in a movie called ""Dumb Luck"", what can you say about that???????"
2,DVD quality and dancer quality also,"The quality of the DVD is bad also the program is mediocre with a a no good ballerina even for the time because at the same time there where dancer like Gregory, Bujones,Harvey dancing with much more better style and tecnich"
1,Old out dated performance,Both the dancing and the sound quality of this DVD are dated. This is a performance that is dull from beginning to end.
5,Better than the original!,I grew up loving my View-Master and now my 5 year old has this version and he just loves it. He spends a lot of time playing with it and I couldn't be more satisfied with the purchase.
1,Poor Quality,"We recieved one for our son's 3rd birthday this June. He LOVED it, but we had to take it back because the sound didn't play. All it kept doing was making the switching of pictures noise. Our replacement did the same thing. We've come to find out that a few of our other friends had the same problem. Until the problem gets fixed, I wouldn't recommend buying one...it seems to be a BIG waste of time."
3,Catridges have quality issue,"This Viewmaster player with sound works well. However, some of the sound cartridges do not fit into the player. The reason is that the little contacts in the cartridge slot need to make contact with the chip on the cartridge. The circuit board on the cartridge for that reason needs to be grinded down so that the pins slip over onto the board. In two of the cartridges I bought this was not done right during production so that the cartridge could not be inserted deep enough and made no contact. This (or having the reel upside down or using a reel without sound) is the reason for the clicking sound. A little nail file fixes this problem. Fisherprice should probably fix this QA issue."
1,Could not get it to work at all!,"I dont know what is going on with this new viewmaster. Could not get it work even one time. Took it back and bought the one without voice, and it also broke less than a week. Will try and classic model since I now have the reels, and nothing to put them in."
4,The grestest toy!!!!!!!!!,this is the greatest toy of all time. The only reason I rate this toy a 4 is because it only came with 4 clone troopers. It should at least come with 10. The price is also a bit high but its worth it!!!
4,Gunship able to topple any foe!,"Well, two things I liked about this toy. Theres so many things that move! Even though this toy was a little expensive, I made good use of it. The doors slide open the gun turrets on either side move, and many other good things.Love this toy,STAR WARS FAN"
2,Interesting....,"Got this collection as I have read all the books and I collect african hunting literature and video. I thought I was on to a classic, and, in some way, I was. But, it is not what you expect: Capstick talking about hunting, whilst others do it. The hunts are not filmed well, there aren't enough of them and in most cases you may not even see the shot.On the other hand, it was good to see what Capstick looked like and his style. Would I have bought this had I read this review? Probably not!"
3,Does its job,"This is an adequate mystery novel. It moves along, the protagonist is interesting enough, and the plot is believable. I wasn't satisfied with the ending or with the way the protagonist behaved in every situation, but this was different than other things I've read and it kept my attention. I think with a little more feedback or rereading the author could've made this stronger, especially at the end, but it was worth the quick read. The protagonist's mental illness definitely added depth to the novel because the reader must constantly question his reliability.I don't consider this a thriller because nothing scary happens and it's not an edge-of-your-seat read, so don't expect that. This about mystery behind a death and the subsequent events."
2,"Great premise, bad ending","This book had me right until the last sixty pages or so. I read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. The main character is a total original - a manic depressive painter who tries to control his psychotic tendencies with medication, but keep himself a little bit insane for the sake of his art. It was a very accurate portrayal of bipolar disorder. Unfortunately the last third of the book quickly loses credibility and ends in a most unsatisfying way. I can only recommend this book for those who suffer from bipolar and are perhaps looking for a character they can identify with. This book is a lightweight mystery with Hollywood ambitions - nothing more, nothing less."
5,check out this excellent frenchie compilation,"Radio Nova, the station behind this cd, was one of the best discoveries I made last year when I was in Paris. The international flavor and the fantastic variety of music on Nova Tunes will make you beg for more...this compilation is the perfect introduction for American listeners to this great radio station--trip-hop, bossa-nova, and lounge all together on a cd perfect for a chill party...invite some friends over and enjoy!"
4,Not a bad starter case,"Not a bad starter cue case to keep your two-piece cue in separate compartments. The build quality is pretty good, outside is clean looking and the hinges/snaps feel sturdy. Inside there is space for a standard size cue and maybe a piece of chalk in each compartment, or a standard cue with joint protectors. I keep this one at home to hold onto my old J&J cue in case one of my friends needs to borrow it, if you go out and shoot in tournaments or travel a lot, I would recommend a oval/tube style case with a shoulder strap instead, much more convenient and the cue is better protected."
2,Decent,"It's a decent cue case, probably best use for storing a spare cue you're not going to use. Everything about the case lets you know that it isn't really top of the line, but it hasn't fell apart on me yet. I'd honestly go for a bit more expensive carry case/bag than this."
3,Catchy but repetitive,"I wanted to absolutely love this album, but it out wore its novelty pretty quickly. It's hard to judge this album based on the samples you can listen to as previews - you often hear the refrain or a really catchy hook in the preview... but then realize that the whole song feels like a repetition of that one catchy bit. Don't get me wrong - I still enjoy and love a lot of these songs, but I can't listen to the whole album straight through: it lacks diversity and depth. There are times when I have to change a song midway through because it gets to the point of annoying, but then I go around humming it all day long (which is not necessarily a bad thing). If you like Sean Hayes, you'll love this album. He's worth checking out."
3,One size fits all????? NO,I bought this watch for my lady for her B-Day and was shipped promptly but it was a little bigger than expected and DO NOT believe the one size fits all. My lady is petite but it was way to big and no way to adjust the size because it is meant to be worn like a bracelet. I guess it would fit a lady with big man wrists. Nixon has very nice products but the size is too big!!!
1,problem after problem,"This vacuum has been nothing but trouble for almost 2 years. I've replaced the belt in this thing 5 times. The on/off switch has to be held up to keep it running. The brush stops rolling when you push it forward, but comes back on when you pull it back. The clean/dirty indicator lights work intermittently. I've had it! I'm on my way out to buy a new vac."
5,Ike is the BEST!,It amazes me that this guy isn't famous. One of my top ten favorite singer/songwriters in 45 years of music worship. Ten bucks for an MP3 album!!!! Why? BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT!!!!!!!
3,Enjoyable - but not definitive - life of an American legend,"Admirers of the late Speaker O'Neill will find much to like in Jack Farrell's ""Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Century""; Farrell offers a generally adoring account of O'Neill's life, but he also does not shirk from documenting some of the Speaker's less-than-admirable public and private activities. Though welcome, this book does not offer a definitive portrait of O'Neill's life and times - Farrell gives short shrift to his subject's early life, his career in the Massachusetts state legislature, and his years as a junior congressman. Despite shortcomings such as these, ""Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Century"" provides an enjoyable account of a remarkable public figure."
1,I was duped!,"I was so interested in reading this book because we had lived in Seattle, and I thought ""Red Rose"" was an actual house. As I got into the book, which I thought read like a badly written romance magazine story, I began to suspect this was another Blair Witchtake-off.Why an author feels they have to do this, I can't imagine. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,"Cheesy, trite, exploitative but a page turner","Who was it that said there's a sucker born every minute? Never underestimate the sophistication of your audience? I am giving it two stars just because it is SO creatively contrived, and there is such an essence of authenticity- Down to the fake website with pen and ink drawings of the characters- yeah, like dozens of people just disapeared because an entity which is in fact a building itself called RoseRed, gets jealous. er... right. The fact that some academic phd found a diary at a flea market ...!! oh this is very clever.needless to say I read the book cover to cover .It's worth the 75 cents I paid for it. Good gimmick I say."
1,Ripped-off!,"Call me stupid if you want, but I bought this book thinking it was an authentic 1907 diary! I didn't bother to bring my magnifying glass with me to Waldens so I didn't see the tiny ""fiction"" on the back cover next to the bar code! I'm a King fan, but I am thoroughly disgusted with him and Hyperion! This is fraud! I would never have bought this book knowing it was fiction! I hope someone sues the pants off King and Hyperion!I see that some reviewers say that the book was sold in the fiction section of the bookstore.......it was in nonfiction at the store where I bought it. I returned the book...the manager had no idea what I was complaining about until I explained tha it was misrepresented as nonfiction. Last time I checked it was still displayed with nonfiction titles."
2,A Big Flop,"Well, I watched the movie on TV (the end was very dissapointing) and figured maybe the book would make up for it but I was very wrong. While some of the parts were somewhat interesting to read the rest was simply words to fill up additional pages. If there would have been more to the diary along with more detail I might have gotten into it eventually. Oh well, life goes on."
2,diary of ellen rimbauer,"I too am scepticle of reality of book due to wording,doesnt fit in with that time and if King wrote it I would think he would know better.Also some things just didnt seem to fit with common sense of time period.Am disappointed.C.C."
5,Thrilling,I love this book. I didn't know at the time this story was fiction. I thought this diary was real. It made the book more exciting. I couldn't put it down.
1,"Disappointed, and a little angry.","I saw the ""documentary"" on Rose Red, and went to Amazon.com to order this book. After reading everyone's VERY HELPFUL reviews, I now realize that the documentary was just a trailer for the Stephen King series.What makes me angry is the fact that one was led to believe that the diary really existed - there were interviews with the ""editor"" who talked about Ellen Rimbauer's writing style, etc. etc. And even though the pictures of Ellen Rimbauer looked too modern to me, the documentary managed to convince me that this was all on the up and up.Now I wouldn't buy this book for 25 cents. Many thanks to all the reviewers who warned me off!"
5,WOW!!!!,"I recently watched the made for tv program Rose Red. After watching this I wanted the book, but did not get it b/c i am not big on reading. After a recent trip to Seattle, Wa. I decided to pick up the book for the return trip. I paid the publishers price of 22 dollars...and Wow! I totally do not regret the money i spent..I find the book rather small so I limit how much i read each night...I am a male and the book is in a females point of view...(female problems, love, etc.) Kinda like a romance novel but in a horror prespective. I recommend this book to everyone. Yet I will add that is for more a mature audience, w/ some sexual notations..this book is wonderful and will have me reading more books in the future."
1,prepare to be bored,"you would think a diary would contain serious introspection & detailed depictions of personal events. not here. you would think that a tie-in to a ghost story which is supposed to be a ghost story itself would be scary, spooky & spend lots of time detailing supernatural phenomena in depth. not here. here you get boring and repetitive narration full of cliches, & where it touches on the supernatural, it is cliched as well. a waste of money."
1,worst book ever,I love cheddar cheese and bacon bits. This book had neither cheddar cheese or bacon bits. This book is a biatch.
1,"Disappointed it's all fiction, author, story, house, everything","I fell for the hoax. It was an interesting read until I found out that the author is a man, Joyce Reardon Phd. does not exist, Beaumont University does not exist, and Disney owns the rights to the book and movie!! I wouldn't have been the least bit interested if I'd known it was fiction."
2,It's awful to be deceived,"Aside from Grisham and Sandford, I am a reader of non-fiction. I was thrilled at the idea that an old diary had been discovered that was written by a woman who resided in a haunted house. I read the introduction to the book that was supposedly written by a person researching the strange goings-on in Rose Red. I started reading with great anticipation. As I began to read I wanted to believe that this was the real thing but immediately began to doubt; it didn't seem like a diary at all, but rather a complete novel, which is exactly what it turned out to be.What a cruel hoax. I'm putting the book on the market immediately.I couldn't give it only one star because it is so well written, but the hoax and the tawdry sexual depictions made me despise this book.Mr. King - could you have sold the book without the hoax and the sex?"
2,There is a reason to feel Duped,"First of all I did not find this in the ""fiction section"" and those of us that don't read a great deal of fiction (I prefer the historial non fiction genre) would have no way to be aware of the fact this was a ""King"" fabrication, then to lend authenticity with a bogus web site seems underhanded. I do not mind the story but lets call the book what it is, fiction. Don't pretend it is anything but. Waste of money."
1,Duped,"I enjoy history, especially early Seattle, and I wastaken in by the book. I would never have bought/read itif I had known it was a clever fabrication. I returned thebook and don't recommend it. There are authentic diaries andstories that can enrich one's life and are far more interesting."
3,"OK, but he can do better","This book is actually written by Stephen King -- oddly the Amazon Database lists the fictional ""editor"" as the real author. The book was ok but I expected better from King. The characters lack the depth of development I an used to from him, and the ending is anti-climactic and vague."
3,Should have read it before the TV show,"I purchased this book after seeing the miniseries, with great expectations, and have to be honest...I was a little disappointed. While it did serve to explain some of the ambiguities in the show, it wasn't all I had expected. It was good reading, there's no doubt, but it took a while to get going and could have offered more."
3,Okay,The book was interesting not what i was expecting I was expecting something a little more exciting. I would not recommend it to my friends to read.
3,A Dark and Disturbing Diary,"You all remember the popular Stephen King mini-series that aired earlier this year on ABC under the auspicious title of Rose Red: the story of a group of ""gifted people"" who, with the help of Joyce Reardon, venture into the old abandoned mansion known as Rose Red, where within they come in contact with the supernatural, though in no way that has ever been televised before. But what happened to the former occupants of the house? The ghosts that now dwell within, what were their lives like? Well here's your answer. For the first time ever the diary of Ellen Rimbauer has been released to the public, giving her life story and how it was fraught with pain and loss, and how Rose Red eventually drove her insane. My only suggestion to the read would be: it's okay to leave the light on if you want to.Originally published in July/August 2002.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
4,Enjoyed being TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF,"After reading half of ""Misery,"" I vowed never to buy another Stephen King book, but I was flim-flammed. I wanted to believe, despite the clear discrepancies... had a great read...and was disappointed in the end. Still, it was worth it."
1,boring,"what a disappointment this book turned out to be .I had purchased this book thinking that it sounded interesting ( not knowing of the telemovie or of Kings involvment)but as with a lot of new releases the back page is more interesting than the novel.If one was to take out all the unnecessary sexual references there is little left to read.However, this is supposed to be a diary and the personal touches are needed,but I don`t know many people who include dialogue in their personal diaries! The idea was great but the author failed miserably in trying to sustain any form of suspense or horror."
4,Good Read.... One setting book,I read this in one setting. Very quick moving and allows you to better understand what transpired in the movie. I would recommend this to anyone who is a true SK fan!
2,Boring as hell,"The whole story from beginning to end was pretty uninteresting, and didn't add much to the TV miniseries. I had to force myself to read the entire thing, hoping it would get better. Not worth buying at any price."
3,Bravo!,"A ""Bravo!"" just for the hype. The diary (novel) itself was a bit goofy (how's that for an intelligent critique?), but all of the effort that lead up to it has to be commended. Especially the 'University' web site. Oh, boy. Good one.I'm giving S.K. credit for THAT, at least.Don't be upset by the fake-out; having been around as long as he has, S.K. has permission to screw around once in a while."
4,Did he or didn't he?,"I must say this was an excellent, almost hard me fooled, and needed to put it down twice and reassure myself this was fiction, I have to read it again now book! As for the wuthor. Reardon was the name of the psycho doctor chick in the movie. She doesn't exist. Yes, she has a spot on what seems to be a legit college webpage. The college doesn't exist. That was... wow. That blew me away. So the question is, did he or didn't he? He did. This book had all the markings of a truly wonderful King book. How could he not?! Besides... Does he make movies/mini-series' of anything other than his own work? Anyways this book was AWESOME!"
4,Intrigueing,"Really good. Well written story. Haunted house or haunted woman? Makes ya' wonder!! I real enjoyed the book, no matter the answer to that question."
3,Could have been so much more...,"After all the hype of Steven King's mini-series (which I missed!), The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer was a let down. Though the story was well written and worth the time, I could just imagine all that was not covered by the story. The story could have been expanded in so many ways. It was not as gripping as I expected."
4,Fictional novel??!!,"I cannot believe I fell for this! I have read the book, visited the website and rented the movie just to find out more about Rose Red and Ellen Rimbauer. I am not one who typically reads Stephen King or anything remotely scary. I was so scared while reading this book (because I thought it was true!) that I would not even sleep in the same room as the book. Boy they got me good!"
3,Promotional Genius or Scamorama?,"What an elaborate marketing strategy for the ABC ""Rose Red"" mini-series: the timely emergence of the diary of ""Ellen Rimbauer""; a fake documentary on ABC about Seattle's supposed Rose Red mansion with the ""real"" paranormal researcher Dr. Joyce Reardon, Steven Rimbauer, a construction materials expert, a Seattle Historical Society spokewoman, etc.; and a fake website for ""Beaumont University,"" the alleged academic home of Dr. Reardon. (Even Amazon.com is in on it, pronouncing the Rimbauer diary in its ""Book Description"" as ""a rare document..."")"
1,Poorly Written Hype,"This is one of the silliest books I've ever read. First, whoever Joyce Reardon is, he/she should research the type of writing a post-Victorian woman would have written before they try to mock-up such a piece of lurid fiction. This book is no better than a Harlequin romance with a couple of paranormal events thrown in. Steven King may have written this, but in that case, he's no better at satire (if that's what he's attempting) than he is at horror fiction. Save your money and your intelligence."
3,don't be silly,I certainly hope some of the above reviewers realize this book was never meant to REALLY be taken seriously. Of course it's not real--isn't Stephen King the actual author?
2,I could've skipped this one,"Not Stephen King's best work. And a little bit pointless. If I'd've missed this one and the made-for-TV movie, I wouldn't have missed much.Buy it if you're an SK fanatic, or have a haunted house 'thing'. Otherwise, don't waste the time."
2,Just Plain Dumb,"To start off I was mislead and was told by someone that it is based on a true story. So you can imaged when I started doing research to learn more and found nothing I was pretty disappointed. Non the less, I continued with the book. I found that the book had it's interest moments, but they were few and far between. I was also just as annoyed, as a reviewer had stated before on this site, when looking for the missing excerpts and finding that they were not missing ones but a few pages from the book. This book is clearly not worth the hype or the money to buy it."
5,The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer,This book explains everything about Ellen Rimbauer anyone who is into this kind of books ought to read it.
1,Upset by Deceptive Synopsis,"I am extremely disappointed that the author of this book chose to deceive buyers by pretending that this is a true story. I prefer nonfiction, and purchased this ... book after reading the back review stating that this is a true story about a diary found in Washington. I eagerly read the first chapter, and immediately had serious doubts about the integrity of the author's description. Soon, I realized that the book was a complete fabrication, full of paranormal garbage, and I returned it immediately. I find it strange and sad that the author must lie to the audience to dupe people into buying this book."
2,A house of horrors.,"This is an account of a diary, a real one this time. Yet it is not like one you would enjoy as it is so sordid. Ellen relates the deviant behavior she learns from her older, disreputable husband and her unhealthy relationship with her foreign maid.It also shows how a house is constructed against all odds and its deadly consequences. Murders occur which are never explained and people disappear.I want to think that this is a true story, but how could a well brought up woman write such filth? It is not easy to read unless you want voyeur feelings into the lower life of the very rich and the things they can get away with."
4,A terrific story that stands well alone,"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is the companion piece for Stephen King's recent miniseries, Rose Red. It provides the entire backstory of the Rimbauer family and the events described, but barely shown, in the t.v. show. I read it in between the 2nd and 3rd installments, and ended up enjoying it much more than the miniseries itself. While the book is presented as a diary ""edited"" by a fictional character, I think it was done in fun, not to ""trick"" the reader as several other reviewers seem to believe. Even if you haven't seen the show, I would recommend this book as a great ""haunted house"" story. (In fact, THIS is the movie they should have made.)"
3,lost diaries,To those of you who want to find the lost entries. Go to the web site listed and you will get Beaumont University. Click on Departments and go to paranormal studies. You will find Dr. Janet Reardon and get everything about Rose Red. There are pictures of all of the supposedly missing people along with the missing exerpts. The book is good and the use of actual people who happened to live at the time is typical Stephen King.
3,Great Novel....,"But it was certainly not meant to stand on its own. It was written to lend history to the ABC television mini series ""Rose Red"". The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is a great tool to understanding the mini series, as well as the mini series served to answer some of the questions the book left you begging.Joyce, the ""author"" of this book, was the lead scientist in the miniseries ""Rose Red"". In the novel she notes that she is going in to the house, to reawaken the ""dead cell"" -a house that the haunting has gone dormant in. The movie picks off where the editors notes leave off. The movie on the other hand starts with the assumption that everyone has read the novel, and understands the tainted history of the now haunted house. In a perfect world, the novel would be sold with the 6 hour miniseries as a companion piece.While the book is an enjoyable, and creepy read, it is enhanced with the viewing of ""Rose Red""."
3,Great Start,"I bought this book for my sister in law, she loves Rose Red and has seen the movie at least a 1000 times. I ordered the book, gave it to her, and she read it in 3 days and was happy with it. However, she wishes it would have been the original complete diary where as this is most of the diary but certian sections were removed for ""obscenity"" and ""offensive writting"" by Joyce Rearden. If you are just interested in the highlights then this is a good book; but if you want the complete unedited story I would look for something else."
4,Good Read,"This book is a good read, nicely written. Filled with lots of action, suspense and horror. The pace of the book is okay as well, just wish it could have been longer.As books by this author goes...this is a great one!"
3,A fun afternoon read,"I wanted to read this ""diary"" because of it's tie-in to the ABC movie ""Rose Red"" and to Stephen King - my favorite author. I am writing this review while I still have 10 pages left to read but I would already recommend this to King fans and anyone who plans on watching the mini-series. It's a good,easy read with some fun King references and although I'm almost sure that SK did not write this one, I had a thought that perhaps Tabitha King might have. After reading the diary, I am primed to watch the mini-series so the book did what it was supposed to do."
1,"Oh, Stephen, you've been a bad boy.","I think everyone who has shelled the bucks for the ""diary"" and subsequently smelled a rat is taking it pretty well, if these customer comments are any indication. As an ardent student of history, coming face-to-face with and recognizing said rat in the first two pages of the ""diary"", I felt as one might upon trying to cash in a phony lottery ticket. Betrayed, angry, cheated, bereft....and then full of admiration for the (----) it takes to construct and pull off a hoax of this magnitude. Paying reader zero, and one for the rat."
4,Stephen King's touch,"""The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" in the early, hardcover edition was placed on the non-fiction shelves of my local library, before it became apparent that this book was part of an elaborate marketing device involving a tv miniseries by Stephen King.The book is a well-written, gripping thriller of the haunted house genre. It appeals to the bodice-ripper-romance women's market, although it is crafted several notches above the average in that niche. Stephen King's touch is apparent, although reading this work did not give me bad dreams as many of his novels have done. I stopped reading them for a time because of that effect.""Diary"" is finely spun, a cotton-candy treat of a suspense novel."
4,I still dream about this house...,"This was my first experience of seeing a movie, or in this case a miniseries, then reading the book. This was even more unusual because the events in the book preceeded the events in the miniseries. I found this to be quite effective. Although most of the events in the book were alluded to in the miniseries, the book was much more detailed and illustory. I would say that if you did not see the miniseries, the book will doubtless be a satisfying read, but not near as fulfilling."
5,Red Rose Diary,I bought this for my wife and she said that while it begins a little slow it gives a lot of interesting detail on what happened before the movie. She liked it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the movie.
3,A Scam,"This is fiction--the diaries are not real, the author listed on the cover is not real, the foreword is not real. This entire book is supposed to be made up. Which is fine, but the people (whoever they are) who put this book together went to a lot of trouble to create the imnpression that this is supposed to be based on real documents. I felt cheated and offended by this marketing trick that was supposed to draw viewers to themini series.Despite all the above ranting, the book is quite fun. I got it for a long plane ride and it did the trick--supernatural phenomena, abused wife, mystery--it has all thecomponents of a good Stephen King novel. So why bother pretending it is not?"
5,"Exceptionally, unusual","Well, excuse me all you negative reviewers. If this was really one of King's works, it is one of the best I have read in many a year. I saw the tv movie, Rose Red, first and wondered about the history of this nice little movie. Then I saw the book on The Best Seller List for several weeks and thought it must be something I had to read. Took me another several weeks to get it from my LIbrary and I loved it. I wish it was real. KIng was getting really far out for my taste and this appealed to me. Keep it up, Mr. KIng. Not all your stuff is that good but do another one of this or similar to The Shining. Anne"
4,A Rather Interesting Visit To Rose Red,"The life of Ellen Rimbauer and Rose Red is very captivating. It was a page turner that I was very hard pressed to put down until the less than satisfying end. It gives a lot of history on Ellen, her husband and how she came to be the person she became. It also gives some interesting theories of why Rose Red ""is who she is."" I don't know if I necessarily believe in the paranormal but I would definately not be willing to test any theories by staying in that house! A very good read. Be prepared to do it in one sitting ... maybe with a light on or two."
3,Inventive marketing if nothing else,"I just finished this book and did find it hard to put down. No great masterpiece of course but clever. Written as a diary in first person I think made it a breeze for someone like King. It took me a little while but it became very apparent that a man not a woman wrote this diary (book). Every woman should know what I mean. And of course it is a brilliant accompaniment to the movie. Oh...and the website thrown in as a little added publicity was a cute idea. The only question is (like the egg) which came first, the book or the movie?? I'd love to know how that man's mind works. lol"
3,Quick Read,"I read through the 252 pages very quickly - not because I could'nt put it down, more that it was just a very simple story that did not require much concentration. I am a Stephen King 'Constant Reader' and did not feel that King had written this one. One thing that bothered me was that the book leads you to believe that Ellen had an affair in 1946 with an actress who disappears in Rose Red but goes on to say that she was age 70 in 1950 - just find it hard to swallow that a 66 year old Ellen was having a lesbian affair (in her younger years, ok - but at 66!).It is not like King to throw something so unbeliveable into the mix at that point in the story. It was an enjoyable story - not spellbinding or anything near that but somewhat entertaining."
5,Am I the only one...,Who was completely taken in by the diary and after finally getting wised up - wanted it to be real so that there would be more?
3,IS THIS FOR REAL?,"THE STORY IS GOOD, KEEPS YOU FLIPPING THE PAGES. OF COURSE THERE IS SOME DOUBT AS TO WETHER OR NOT THIS IS THE REAL DEAL OR SOME SCAM TO TERRIFY THE READER WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE TRUE.I FOUND MYSELF CURIOUS TO READ THE SO CALLED ""EDITED DIARY ENTRIES"" THAT DR. READON FELT WERE NOT APPROPRIATE TO PUBLISH BUT ACCEPTABLE ENOUGH TO PUT UP ON A WEB SITE.BY THE WAY I CANNOT FIND IT. IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE THAT COULD HOOK A SISTER UP WITH THE SITE?"
1,Waste of good paper,I haven't been this disappointed in a book since Jean Auel's last one. Embarassed I even bought it. I would never have bothered to finish it but was on an airplane with nothing else to do.
4,"Not a edge of your seat page turner, but a good read.","Very good story, interesting charters, but not as good as the movie. The end of the story is lacking, there is no climax, but it is worth taking time to read. Could have been better."
3,I've been had,"I read this book three years ago and thought it was fabulous. Then tonight I learned that it is fictional. I don't know whether I should laugh at myself or write a letter of complaint (to whom, I'm not sure). When I read this book in hardback, there was no markings or the fantastical artwork that now adorns the paperback cover to indicate that it was fiction. But, I'm glad to see (based on other comments here) that I wasn't alone in believing that Dr. Joyce Reardon and her sidekick Stephen Rimbauer, characters who so believably introduce and tie up this fictitious diary, were real people. Anyhow, beware. This is not a real diary. It is fiction. Enjoy it as such."
1,Not worth reading,"Ok, I went into this looking for a nice read, possibly by the producer of the tv show, Mr. King, and found myself trapped in a boring book. Unbelievable voice-for a supposed diary of a turn of the century sheltered wife, it winds up resorting to cheap tricks to make any attempt at hooking the reader--her unexpected lesbian yearnings for her assistant, stupid pop culture references to upcoming inventions, etc. Heavy handed. Drawn out. The same story over and over and over again. Pass this one by. It is rare that a television mini series is better than the book, but, in this case, there are few things worse than the book."
2,"Not bad, but very slow","The title says it all. This is not a bad book, but extremely slow and hard to get through (at least it was to me). I am not sure to what degree Stephen King is involved with it, but I don't like everything he writes either. I loved Desperation, Black House, Dreamcatcher, and many other of his books. I could hardly get through Hearts in Atlantis and From a Buick 8. Your mileage may vary."
4,I was fooled!,"I bought this book for my sister-in-law for Christmas. Before I mailed it off, I decided to read it. I read it in three nights and was terrified! My husband said the book said fiction on the jacket, but I assured him it was all true! After finding out, I was both dissapointed and relieved to know it wasn't true. I don't think it would have been as engaging or captivating if I had known before I started that it was fiction. Surely, I wouldn't have been scared."
2,Not impressed,"Pretty boring for the first 100 pages of details of the ""authoress"" writing about her life in 1900's Seattle, then her 'round-the-world honeymoon. Parts of it within the house itself are okay, but there are much better haunted house stories around. Lots of skimming, as with most Stephen King books."
5,Ellen,"I found this book to be fascinating. However, if I had not already read Rose Red and seen the movie, I don't think it would have made much sense. As I had done these things, I found it a very satisfying read."
3,Better than Ellen Rimbaurer movie,"This book was quite interesting. I had seen the movie: The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer before reading the book and thought I wouldn't like it, since I didn't care for the movie. However, the book was much better than I expected. It has been edited by someone with the pseudonym Joyce Reardon which is actually a guy from what I researched but is told in a diary form with entries made by Ellen. It covers the start of her courtship with John Rimbauer up through her death. But along the way you learn about her relationship with John and how the man she once loved turned out to be someone she hated and how her famous haunted house Rose Red protected her along with her servant Sukeena by killing off men and causing women to disappear. I would recommend the book if you're just looking for some easy leisurely reading."
5,Wonderful and suspensful!!!,"RARLEY do I read mystery/thrillers...but a friend mentioned she wanted to read this, and after looking it up, it sounded really good. I'm so glad I bought it! This book kept me up very late for 2 nights in a row...but it was worth it. I love the format of the book, being all journal entries from Ellen's diary...starting in 1907 (age 19) till 1928.It's a fascinating and riveting journey into the life of Ellen and her philandering husband John, and one cannot forget Rose Red herself. You go on to read about the demise of Ellen's sanity, and how their palace of a house starts to take on a life of it's own. It's an excellent book all around. I highly recommend it. To those who read thriller/mysteries all the time, this is probably no big deal...tame stuff. But for someone like me...it was the perfect amount of suspense and creepiness."
1,Couldn't finish it,"This was truly dreadful. I gave it 100 pages and was bored half out of my mind. I've been an avid King fan for 20 years, but this was a horrible addition to his library of work. I'm just glad I borrowed it from the library."
2,Not silk,"I ordered this ""silk"" skirt in blue and size 8 and unfortunately it is not at all what I expected. First of all, it's not silk, it's 100% Viscose, both shell and lining. The quality is therefore stiff and heavy, not light and flowing like I expected. The skirt reeks of plastic. It's actually too heavy for a summer skirt. I am usually a size 6, this one barely fits though it's a size 8, so you have to order at least one size up. The lining seems to be a size smaller than the skirt and fits very tight, clings to hips and legs. On the plus side, the color is nice and vivid, and the embroidered belt is a pretty detail, but all in all I am not very happy with it. It's not too bad a deal for 12 dollar, but it should not be offered as a silk skirt, when it's not silk."
1,Rambling,"Unlike the author, I'll be concise. The book was rambling, disorganized and lacked structure. There were several memorable anecdotes and one gets a good grasp for the life of a struggling professional golfer. However, Mr. Feinstein was obviously under time pressure to complete the book because it was difficult to follow."
1,Waste of Time,Feinstein is a complete bore. His writing is juvenile and he drags out each story to generate more pages. Feinstein might want to find a ghost writer for his next effort.
4,Great book,Feinstein does a fantastic job of profiling individual players and the trial and tribulations associated with trying to make it on The Big Tour.
4,The PGA Tour in the Mid-Nineties,"""A Good Walk Spoiled"" is a very good look at the pre-Tiger PGA Tour. The book relates the events of the 1993 Ryder Cup and the '94 PGA Tour season and profiles many of the big stars that were then on tour. Other issues examined in the book include what life is like on tour, TV contracts, Q-school, and the mental aspects of golf. The book may seem dated to those who began following the tour after Tiger Woods began his career, but most golf fans will find it an interesting piece of the sport's history."
3,Too little - too much,"This book is OK for golf fans, and the best parts are the behind-the-scenes lives of pro golfers. The endless paragraphs on scoring and strokes become tedious about one third down the book. Love to hear about Davis Love, Curtis Strange, Paul Goydos and those trying to make it on the big tour, but too many repetitive match descriptions, which end-up looking all the same. After reading this, and reading the reviews of ""The Majors"", I will definitively NOT read, let alone purchase, ""The Majors""."
3,"good if you are a golfer, but hugely overrated","If you like golf and want to see some behind the scenes stuff, read this. If not, skip. Even if you are in the former category, it is overrated. I think some sports fanatics who do not read much spend so much effort raving about this book that it gets a bigger reputation than it deserves."
3,"Too much filler, not enough action.","Feinstein basically ignores the golf tournaments themselves in favor of an endless series of anecdotes. I mean, when the U.S. Open playoff is worth one page in the whole book, it's telling.I don't know. The book's pretty good for a bathroom or a dinner read, but it's repetitive and sheer reportage."
2,Not the interesting read I expected,"It was interesting to learn about life behind the tournament scene but to be honest, this book is way too long and what you gather in the first half is enough. The style of writing lends itself more to reporting of facts than to a dramatic one year in the life of the pga. Since Feinstein constantly jumps from golfer to golfer, I never really get a good sense of characters and personalities - which I think is what makes it interesting. Overall, the book was disappointing."
5,Wonderful insight into the Pro Golf world,This book is a wonderful look into the thoughts of people who often seem so unreal to the casual viewer or fan. Finally we feel how they feel at times of great joy and great pain and disapointment.Great Book. I loved it.
3,Not terribly interesting,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but it turns out to be not very interesting. The book is (almost always) better than the movie, but in this case, I'd rather watch golf on tv.Now, if only someone at NPR would read this book and realize that it does not deserve free plugs after every sports report the author does."
4,"Solid, insightful, inspiring","I'll begin by saying that I don't find Feinstein a particularly elegant writer. Like so many of the golfers he admires, Fienstein is a bit of a grinder. I prefer the golf essays of Herbert Warren Wind and John Updike. That said, I immensely enjoyed this book for its detailed and often inspiring look at the golfing and private lives of several players on the Tour. If the book had a central point, I thought it was that playing professional golf is just about as difficult a way to make a living as there is. The physical, mental, and emotional strain is almost unbearable and the lonelieness and self-reliance very fatiguing. Like another reviewer, I did not find the book too long, but too short: I wanted to read about more players and about more seasons."
1,Leif Garrett is worth the rental fee...,"But that's about it. This is a pretty pathetic film. 70's teen idol, Leif Garrett, who is all grown up (And quite nicely, might I add!) stars in this lame horror film that isn't in the least bit horrible! If it scares you...you are probably on Prozac! The plot is, a woman from beyond the grave whispers in people's ears an tries to get them to committ suicide...that's basically it. If you rent this mess and are NOT a Leif Garrett fan, you may end up committing suicide before it ends! Garrett has a look on his face through out the film that says, ""Why am I in this movie?"". That's what your fans want to know too, Leif! Still, he manages to pull of a decent performance."
1,save your money,it is my advise to you to save your bucks and go to D.Q. at least you will know what your getting.
1,Run from this movie as fast as you can.,"I was a Leif Garrett fan, that did not make this movie any better, I turned it off after 20 minutes, I could no longer stand the embaressment I felt for the guy for having done this movie."
3,My opinion of the book has dropped since reading another review and doing a bit of fact checking,"This is an enjoyable read chock full of nice quotes for Theodor Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss) such as when he met Ronald Reagan and quipped, ""Now seven presidents have met me!"" (p. 94)The story is told enthusiastically with some nice color photos (too bad there was no deal with the publishers to include some pictures from the books as well).But,having read another reviewers comments about inaccuracies and having done a bit of research on my own I cannot help but feeling a bit betrayed for the kids in my local library because simple fact checks were not employed. There's no excuse for such easy-to-check ""facts"" to be printed."
4,"Not As Good As ""Intuition"", But...","this is still a decent song from Jewel's 0304. So many people have labeled her as a sell-out, yet lyrically, this song is actually deep and has meaning...not to mention a catchy chorus. The B-side ""Leave the Lights On"" is decent too."
4,"Good, but be Carefull!",This Reggae CD is good. It is a Various Artist CD. It is full of very good Reggae Artist. The music is up temple and it rocks hard and steady. This may make for a good Reggae party CD. Now on the other hand be warned that the Producers decided to use only one tune throughout the entire disc. I don't know if they were trying to promote the artist or that one song.
3,Didn't feel like a running movie,"maybe in an attempt to reach a broader audience this film seems less about running and more about personalities. In this way, it was more of a reality tv show. I wanted more info on training, past successes, equipment, etc. Not a complete loss; it's pretty and it is a good story, but not quite up to par with Running on The Sun, or even Ultramarathon Man."
5,Wonderful Film even if you are not a Runner,"I am not a runner at all and I loved this movie! I feel the story of all three guys and their overall ambition to do something like this was astounding. It was also a great way to show the different communities and their struggles, after watching I went right to [...] and made a donation."
3,Risk game that's made not to be taken seriously. Really!!!,"When you play this game it seems you are playing with a bunch of stoned people. I agree that the AI is dumb as a doornail, but the voice acting is so comical that it makes me laugh every time I play it. All the characters seem to be on some kind od drug and they play or say the most random things. The gameplay is ok, but the best part of this game is laughing at the computer AI for their stupid moves and taunts. If you are a true serious Risk fan forget this game, however if you like to play games just to make fun of them this is the one for you!"
3,Playing against the computer doesn't replace playing humans,"The game is quite fun but playing against the computer can get very boring. The computer is programmed to play a certain way which makes it very predictable. For example, if you take control of the continent, one or more of the other five opponents controlled by the computer will automatically attack you to stop your hold. Also, the computer is programmed so that it often makes very stupid moves. For instance, if an opponent gets weak, then a computerized opponent rarely attempts to take him over. Hence, the key to winning the game is by keeping your eye out for weak opponents and taking them over. Occupying a continent will usually hurt your more than help you.To conclude, the game is fun at first but as you learn how the computerized game system plays, it becomes boring and predictable. Playing against other people is much more fun."
1,No Fixed Sets??? Are you Kidding Me!!!,"I bought this game expecting something similar to the previous playstation version of Risk. Easy playability, easy to understand set up screens... and most of all the ability to choose between increasing sets and fixed sets for the risk cards. Apparently the makers of this game did not see any of these as important especially the last one. How could you make a Risk game that forces you to always play some form of increasing sets? Well This game is going back to the store tonight."
3,Game bugs out,This would be a fun version of the board game.It does a number of things for you.In my case it helps stop my friends from cheating by alloting your armies for you. It also has interesting comments from the computor generals.It has neat battle scenes when you attack. In all It could be a great game.The bugs are what cause its downfall. I couldnt turn in sets untill I had 5 cards.It would say I had 4 cards and then only 1 appears when I look at them.At the start my 6th turn and after having 5 cards it would force me to use them and only then it shows my 5 cards I can use. So till they fix this bug its thumbs down
1,Huge Letdown,"I love playing Risk. My friends and are fanatical about the Playstation version that was released years ago and is now hard to find. When we heard that there was new version for the PS2 we were so excited we could hardly wait. Oh, the possibilities. New maps, new opponents, new power ups and better music....oh, wait, sorry, someone screwed up. This was perhaps the most disapointed I have been in a long time. This game has less variety than the Playstation one version. No Ultimate Risk? Only one map? My god, no power ups or options. I was imaging things like, historical maps and warring with great leaders, but there is none of that. There are no gaming options. All you can do is play with the dice. That is it. I special ordered this game because no where around where I live was going to get it and I sold it for 3 dollars a week later. If only they would have called and talked to me...I could make a kick ass Risk game. This one sucked."
1,Blah! The original PS1 version is so much better!,"I was really excited to get the PS2 version of Risk. I envisioned an updated ultimate section with new maps and cool ways to customize. I WAS REALLY EXCITED!! The PS2 version is a total wipeout. REALLY LAME!! Just a bunch of boring AI characters. Ohh, special dice! Who cares about what kind of fancy dice you get to watch. That just slows the game even more. Fancy uniform upgrades. Talk about WEAK! Not to mention the flaws with the actual gameplay. Save your money and stick with the PS1 version. Shame on Atari. I expected so much more from you guys! Develop a game like the PS1 version with some major upgrades and I will be there to write a great review!!"
4,This game rocks,this game rocks I brought it to thanks-giving and everyone loved it. though I wouldn't suggest it for anyone under 6 years old beacause it is a little to tough for them
1,Horrible,First of all this game blows nuts and its not fun second who finds entertament by watching gay little soldiers kill each other. bottom line this game sucks
5,Doggone Great CD,"This CD is full of folk songs dedicated to canines and those who love them. Some of the songs are not avaiable in print anywhere I could locate. I transcribed and used the ""The Poodle Dog Song"" with the Texas 2006-7 Bluebonnet List Children's Book called """"The Toughtest Cowboy"""" in a r-eaders' theatre presentation. My third graders couldn't quit singing it.Here is the Amazon link for the book: [...]Yes, the recordings are very, very country!"
3,A well written history of the American Revolution,"Thomas Fleming does an excellent job of guiding the reader into 18th century America and Europe and the years of the Revolution. It is well written and very entertaining. If only his material was a little more balanced. He seemed more interested in criticizing the British than giving an overall view of what the Revolutionary period was really like on both sides. Take the subjects of mob rule and slavery, for example. Mr. Fleming brings up the fact that both occured in 18th century America, but instead of an in-depth account from the American point of view, he, instead, criticizes ONLY the British in regard to mob rule and slavery. Other than that, I enjoyed his book very much."
5,Pure genius in form,"Thomas Fleming has written a most comprehensive overview of the American revolution. He gives us the causes, the players, the conflict and the outcome. Extremely well organized and very well written. Nicely illustrated. The seperate sidebar articles give the reader ample background on such issues as what America was like and what Americans were like during the period. He tells us about slavery. He tells us about the German soldiers hired out to the British by the varius greedy princes. He tells us about George III who was personally a wonderful human being but a political want to be despot and cunning politician but narrowmindedness ultimately proved his undoing. He really does a great job.Really a great book on the subject. Combined with the video cassets of the same name, this book makes a great and entertaining means for obtaining a basic view of the American revolution."
4,"Great Visuals, Good Overview of Revolution","Thomas Flemming's coffee table companion to the television series Liberty is a good book to have around. It's the kind of easy-to-pick-up-and-browse book that will entertain and inform on a moment's notice. It's accessibility is a positive -- its the kind of book that children can pick up and browse, take in a few vignettes and become attracted to the Revolution at their own pace without the intimidation provided by a more typical history.This is a well illustrated book making good use of period paintings and maps. The side vignettes on break out topics often provide fascinating highlights to the main story. The writing is good, although the amount of information provided classifies this book as an overview. The serious student may want the book for the illustrations, but the words cover the broad sweep of the war at a level they will already be familiar with. These factors make it an excellent introduction to the topic."
4,Excellent read,The characters drew me in from the first chapter. I had trouble concentrating when I wasn't reading this book because I was so eager to crack it open and get lost in it's pages.
4,This book was just OK,"The one thing I find really disturbing in this book is how the working class characters are always portrayed as bad and trashy, yet the rich are always elegant, good etc. Except for th Spanish foster lady. The ending was unsatisfying."
5,Great book that is very much discredited.,"I liked this book very much, and it makes me sad to have people put this book down because ""it is too wordy."" Great book are often wordy, titles such as Catcher in the Rye, and Watership Down. Pages are filled with words describing a patch of grass. Descriptive writing is what makes literature worth reading, it gives you the full picture or idea of what the writer is trying to show you. To the person who said janet Fitch has the talent of a freshman in high school, you are so very wrong. Freshman in todays high school rarely have the intelligence to write a children's book as simple as See Spot Run. Being a high school student right now, I believe I am not being too harsh when I say that."
4,Wonderful story about growing up in very disfunctional homes,White Oleander is a wonderful story about growing up in very disfunctional homes.
5,Compelling Book-,"I thought that White Oleander was a brilliant book (as was the film). The characters are unique and interesting, and the protaganist and narrator, Astrid, is thoughtful and compelling. Janet Fitch is a gifted writer.The book and film seem to have been overlooked a bit by the general public but I think that both are worthy of 5/5 stars."
4,White Oleander,White Oleander was an awsome book it keep me into the story the hole time. I never wanted to but this book down. I have also seen the movie. The movie was a little different then the book though. I really recermend this book for anyone to read.
5,"great for a fast, EASY read","Deeper than the average airport novel w/ the ideas it raises about aesthetics vs. morality. Set all over Los Angeles, we see a cross section of America. There are racists in the valley, wealthy Yale-educated inhabitants of the Fred Segal shopping region, hippies and Christians and alcholics to the east. As someone who must live where she is placed, the foster-child/ painter Astrid must discover her own identity apart from class, location, violence or influence. She is a phoenix who rises from ashes. I read this in two days. Novels like this are so much fun. They require none of the work that authors like Morrison (for the Opera reading crowd) or Faulkner or Woolf require."
3,Disappointed reader,"I was so excited to read the White Oleander. I took it out of the local library for 5 days. I crammed every day to complete more and more of the novel each day. Unfortunately, by the time I got to Chapter 29 the novel went down hill quickly. The author seemed to get bored with her writing and left the reader with many options for an ending. The author took the easy way out and left us at a dead end. I wished more from this author but as I returned the book to library the librarian commented ""this author did this in the first book too."""
4,"Strong Beginning, Weak Ending","At first I was enthralled with this book. I couldn't tear my eyes away from the page. Astrid and her problems are so real, and sympathy for her keeps you reading. Then things went downhill. After the suicide of Claire, Astrid becomes more distant and her feelings aren't portrayed as vividly as they are in the beginning of the book. The end was also disappointing, but it made sense. Despite its downfalls, this was still an excellent book. Definitly a good summer read."
5,"I would give it more than 5 stars!!!!! Gorgeous, poetic.","I cannot stop thinking about this book and I finished it more than a week ago! I cannot wait to read it again. And now every- thing I have read since, pales in comparison. It was one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read- the language flowed so poetically, so naturally. I cannot wait to see what else this author writes. I love her style, she could write about anything and turn it into something beautiful, bittesweet."
5,DELIVERS YOU WHOLE BUT LEAVES YOU HAUNTED!,Janet Fitch does a fabulous job of engrossing you in the characters of this book. Her style is both smooth and poetic. Bravo! This story will reach into your deepest thoughts and experiences only to pull you into a totally new direction. This novel is a must read by anyone who has experienced hardship or is simply challenging the journey of life. It will definately make you take a second glance at the importance of building and sustaining relationships.
4,A true and chilling portrayal of the foster care system,"My neice wants to buy a copy for every member of her family. Fitch captures her characters with brutal honesty. The chapter when Astrid wakes up for the first time in her first foster family sent chills up my spine. I raced to the back of the book to read the author's biography. I couldn't believe she didn't grow up in the system. Her descriptions were right on the money. I was a little disappointed in the ending. But, all-in-all a compelling book. I read it in two days. I could not put it down."
3,"Powerful,but so sad.","The author wrote a very powerful, but such a sad story of a very disfunctional family. Hard to believe she would focus only on how a young girl, so talented, wouldn't pursue her artistic dreams."
2,Adjective abuse in an interesting but unfulfilling story,"I must have missed my calling in life if this and Anita Shreve's ,The Pilot's Wife, are examples of publishable writing in the 90s. Both have huge gaps in story and character development. I approached reading each book with anticipation based on Oprah's high praise however I found them to be lacking the in basic requirements of Composition 101. Anyone with a thesaurus could have penned White Oleander. The superfluous use of descriptive phrases and the lack of any caring humanity in this book was annoying and disturbing. Astrid ultimately was as cold and disconnected as her mother but at least we know why,--no mother, father or family--. And in Pilot's Wife that daughter was really cold and unlikable. What's the message here. And where is REALLY good writing?"
1,"Personally, I don't get it.",I kept waiting to like a character and it never happened. Hated the book after I finished it. I don't understand where all of these high ratings are coming from. Wasted my time. After this I knew that if Oprah liked the book to stay away from it.
1,Trite and predictable,"This book was a huge disappointment. I was told by everyone that this book was not to be missed...I wish I would have missed it. It was trite, shallow, and predictable. The author used too many adjectives and cliches rather than actual dialogue or meaningful thoughts. I found the ending to be a little too tidy. If you enjoy books in this vein, read ""She's Come Undone"" by Wally Lamb instead."
1,Beyond Hope. Or: Why Oprah Gave It Her Stamp of Approval,"Fitch has served the reading public a concoction of heavily steeped oleander.White Oleander is the most poorly written book I've ever read. Period. It seized my throat like a pair of sour pliers and juiced me like a lemon. And the ugliness of its prose made me sob like raw razors. Sadly, Fitch's diction has drifted over the valley of literary art like a vast headache and made people dumb with pain.If you mock my figures of speech, I applaud you. Oleander is overgrown with them. (Incidentally, I pulled these weeds from the fields of White Oleander.)Read this book if you want to expose yourself to today's literary allergens. If it doesn't bolster your appreciation for good writing by way of bad example, nothing will. You may as well read Louis L'Amour backwards and rave about the lyrical dreams of a foster child in search of beauty.Save your money (and health). Don't drink Oleander."
4,Unusually written and descriptive,"I had a hard time deciding whether to give this four or five stars! It is written in a peculiar, but fascinating style and once you get used to it, it is positively charming and mesmerising! A truly amazing descriptive narrative that provided me with an incredible imagination on who and what the characters were all about! I'm looking forward to reading what Janet Fitch comes up with next! This story was heart-rendering in a way that fiction seldom accommodates."
5,Moving...heartbreaking...somewhat empowering.,"This story drained me...as a reader I wanted to rewrite the ""Claire"" situation...This book made me sad with the reality that ANYONE can become a parent...you certainly don't have to be selfless or caring. Yet the strongest soul in this book somehow survives, scarred and all."
2,Wordy and overly dramatic,"As a first novel, I applaud the writer. I found it difficult to understand the character's choice at the end, it seemed obscure and self-hating. Janet Fitch's descriptions are over labored, don't flow from the heart, most of her descriptions seem to be heady...I don't think the writer was involved with her main character, Astrid. Good descriptions of Los Angeles...metaphors were overused and narrative did not get to the point..."
2,Typical Oprah Blabber,"This story drones on just as many of Oprah's others. Typical dysfunctional people trapped in their dysfunctional lives. How depressing. I debated whether to fnish this story, and had a hard time getting myself motivated enough to pick it up to complete. I am definitely not a prude, but found the explicit sex nauseating, shocking and unnecessary to get the story across. I read probably a book a week and count numerous other reads that were better written."
4,Good book and addicting too.,"I think this is a good book and takes an inside look into the the foster care system. Astrid is used sexually, made to do everything for some of her abusive foster parents. She is starved and suffers just about everything there is to suffer in the foster care system. What I find fault with is that I think the book holds a political correctness to it. Astrid talks about the racism and racist attitudes about her foster mother. When you are in that kind of situation you could probably care less. So that section felt kind of out of place. Overall it was a pretty good read."
3,what's the point?,"I read this books a long time ago when it first came out, but I wanted to a refresher before I saw the movie so I am reviewing the audiobook edition. The story itself lacks any real focus. The story of a young girl maturing into a woman while going through various fosterhomes. OK, fine, but where's the adventure, plot, point to this? While there were some very very insightful ""ramblings"" it did leave me at the end wondering, ""Ok, now what"". I am wondering even how the movie is made since this book is written so much on thoughts alone. Astrid's thoughts, there is not much in the way of interaction with other people. Just an intereaction and a very long so called analysis afterwards. Not sure if I will bother reading another one of her books. Will have to see what the reviews say."
2,"Readable but soapy, a nice beach book, maybe.","Not as well written as I'd like, with kind of dull descriptions. It's a chronicle of a girl's experience in foster homes, after her mother murders a boyfriend for a bad breakup. Other reviewers have mentioned that the narrative voice is not convincing as coming from a teenaged girl. I have to agree. Also, the ending was forced and saccharine. I thought, after all that, that there would be some lingering damage, but no, the perky heroine lifts herself up and is apparently fine."
2,Great Writing....Terribly Depressing!,"If you are looking for excellent writing, you found the right book....BUT, if you are looking for an uplifting novel do not purchase White Oleander. I found myself in a slump for two weeks while reading this book!"
2,Disappointing,"I was totally disappointed in this book. I had heard it was ""great"" and Oprah gave it high reviews. I found it too wordy, and it dragged on. I couldn't wait until I was done with it. The story itself was OK but the writer took the fun out of reading this book. I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,A gripping novel that enables you to feel the story.,This is an excellent first novel. I predict that this will be the beginning of a very bright future for this young author!
2,Definately not a book to bring on your honeymoon.,"Not having much time to read in my busy life, I was going on a two-week honeymoon with all the time in the world to read. I wanted a great book to bring with me. I caught the Oprah show where she raved and raved about this book. I had to have it. The first week of my honeymoon was pretty much laying around the pool reading this gawd awful miserable book, the second week I didn't even touch it. I depressed me too much. I agreed with Oprah that the writing was really really superb. I enjoyed Janet Fitch's descriptive writing. That was the only thing that kept me attracted to the book. About a month after my honeymoon I finished the book, just because I wanted to see how it ended, hoping for somewhat of a happy ending. What a dissapointment. Absolutely gloomy. Maybe I live in a fantasy world, but I at least expect a happy ending. Sorry Oprah, I have to dissagree."
2,Can you say 'Letdown'?,"Hmmmmm. I'm still scratching my head over this one...I feel so disappointed and cheated, and I'm trying to understand what everyone else saw in this book. My disgust for Astrid's mother was so strong, that I immediately disliked the story, but continued on, hoping that something good would happen to Astrid, but low and behold, something good happens to her mother instead??!! Go figure!"
3,A good writer in need of a good editor,"Janet Fitch definitely can spin her words. Her command of the language and ability to craft clever metaphors is very impressive. But, like many writers who love showing off their talents, she doesn't always know when less is more. The endless commentary about the hot Southern California climate is the most egregious example of her inability to know when to pull back. In terms of plot, the endless trials and tribulations of the main character, Astrid, started piling up so fast that it strained credibility after a while. With the guidance of a stronger editor, this story could have been so much better. It's definitely a page-turner, but one that is ultimately disappointing when you think of what it might have been with a bit more restraint."
2,Too much,"I usually don't read Oprah book club selections. I find they are too much in the ""triumph of the human spirit"" mode to appeal to me. However I had heard this book described else where as ""dark"". So, I figuired I'd give it a try. This book is overwrought, over written and pretty much, just too much. There are some good elements in the writing and in the story, but they are buried in an avalanche of metaphor and melodrama. A more experienced writer may have pulled off the effect the writer seems to be going for- but the result here is just heaviness."
1,"cliche, depressing and not that great.....","I was surprised....after Oprah's rave review, I wanted to read the book. Once I did, I was disappointed. I loved two of Oprah's previous picks ""Paradise"" by Tony Morrison, and ""As I Lay Dying"" by Ernest Gaines. I am currently reading ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" another example of beautiful writing. I applaud Oprah's support of first time novelists, however, I wish she would find a new genre to mine.....we have read so much of the abused woman/child narrator that whatever real truth they may be trying to convey is lost because we've read the same plight repeatedly over the last 12 months. I had little sympathy for Astrid, she seemed as manipulative as her mother....not victim, not triumphant, simply surviving the system."
1,No Good,"I'm afraid I didn't like it at all. The dialogue between the the various Viking warriors was completely contrived and sophmoric. The battle sequences started off well but became boring rather quickly. Warrior-Chief Johannson's final monologue as he was succumbing to his wounds is, no doubt, the stupidest piece of writing ever published in the history of English-language literature. The author was trying to create an epic but only managed to produced an epileptic fit."
2,"What's the point? Foster homes, survival? What's the point??","I'm not against depressing stories, but there must be a point (message or moral) to the story. This story offers no redemption in the end and ON TOP OF that, there is no point! I don't think Astrid becomes a better person for her struggles. Even if a story is depressing, there needs to be something positive that comes out of the story such as a moral or a life lesson. The only thing you think of after this book is ""That poor girl"". Yes, Astrid survived, but I don't think she overcame anything or became a better person. Her experiences hardened her and that's not really a positive message..."
2,So Disappointing,"I was so disappointed in this book. It was laborious and hard to keep your attention focused on what was happening. I finally skimmed the last half, not missing much. It went on forever. I also found the details of Astrid's life to sometimes be vulgar and disgusting. I can't believe Oprah recommended this book."
1,"waste of time, not even one star","This book is probably the most over-rated book I've ever read in my entire life. The narration is corny and painfully slow. I didn't feel sympathy for ANY of the characters in the story, especially the ""protagonist"" who has nothing to show for herself except that she is physically beautiful and seems to take on the attitude of blaming the way she is on her circumstances. I didn't see any fortitude of character or any flawed yet empathy-inducing streak in Astrid or Ingrid. The whole time I was reading the book, I was wondering why the author even bothered to write about such ordinary characters and the ordinary things they do. We can get that from real life. I got the sense that the author was trying very hard to forge them into tragically flawed heroines rather unsuccessfully."
2,"Sorry, but this book was not a hit but a MISS.","I think this was a book that had a lot of potential, but failed to come through. The interesting plot was plagued by excessive metaphorical and descriptive language. I found Astrid's internal dialogue to be a bit vapid and difficult to get through without boredom taking over. Although the characters had depth, I did not find myself invested in them. Maybe it's my instinct to being drawn to strong female characters, but nevertheless I did not enjoy the endless amount of weak female characters that allowed men to take over their mental and physical health. Astrid was an exception, as she was strong enough to break from her mother's hold. Fitch's writing style is irritating, as it seems as if she's trying to hard to impress readers with flowery language. It wasn't a terrible book, but I don't believe it deserved all the praise it received."
4,Read all of it in one day!,"Kept me going and makes me see my mother and family in a new light. And it took me only 8 hours to read, could not sleep without reading it all!"
5,Unbelievably good first novel!,"poetic..I read it in two days, as I was loathe to put it down. The characters are so compelling and realistic you would swear she was writing about her own life...the reader is drawn right in. I feel like recommending it to everyone. Well, not everyone perhaps."
2,Strange but Interesting,"I read this because it was one on Oprah's booklist so I wanted to check it out. This book is about a goofy mother and her goofy daughter's relationship with each other. The mother committed murder so the daughter was put into foster care and lives with a variety of goofy people. I won't tell you how it ends because I don't want to spoil it for you. I found it to be pretty unbelievable and exaggerated, but maybe that's just me. Not one I would recommend."
1,not impressed,"The movie was decent, but I hated the book. Catastrophe after catastrophe piled up, it was like standing on a bridge during rush hour watching a huge traffic accident. Maybe I was spoiled by seeing the movie first, but the book seemed dull (even with all the problems and violence) in comparison. Try as I might, I just could not see what was supposed to be so uplifting about the book. In real life, Astrid would probably be in much worse shape - even if she had her art - after going through so much trauma. Even ""parental kids"" need a bit of stability somewhere."
4,A must read,"If you've seen the movie, trust me it did not do justice to this book! Some of the most interesting plot lines were not included in the movie. The book is very interesting, I could not put it down. With a touch of fatal attraction and mommy dearest the character of the mother will make you want to find out how while in prison she continues to control the life of her teenage daughter. A very good book."
2,This book is very depressing and not very realistic.,"I found myself continuing to read this book just hoping something better would come along. The longer I read, the worse it got. At the end of the book, I got the feeling the author just got tired of writing and just stuck something in so it could be over. It could have been salvaged with a better conclusion. Oprah, try harder next time."
3,Are you reading to cry or be entertained?,"If it's the former, then this is the book for you (and I assume you find crying entertaining). ORLEANDER is a contrived heart plucker. If you're reading to be entertained, read something with some kick to it, something to get your adrenaline flowing instead of your tears--read Kleier's THE LAST DAY or Salinger's CATCHER IN THE RYE. Don't just coast on this stream of brine, get your brain in gear!"
1,"Heavy handed , tasteless","Heavy handed Anne Rice style prose, dripping with ersatz sensuality and crude sensationalism. Really seemed forced and base."
1,This book just seemed devoid of plot.,"The book is so artfully constructed to say absolutely nothing new or different. I was bored beyond belief to try to read my way through the endless pages of vacuos antics, leading me nowhere. I fail to see any value in this book."
1,Another Oprah downer.....,When will I learn. There must be a major plan behind the Oprah recommendations. What's next a book on therapy for all those determined to read her book club suggestions. Help us all. I don't even want this book in my house. Give me uplifting anytime. On to JUNK for summer reading..
3,heads up,"Janet Fitch seems to spend most of her time decribing sscenery and, yes, feelings. the book is heavily illustrated by her words but it gets very annoying. I know that scenery is important, feelings even more so but come on, the ratio of story vs. explanation is tremendous and we get the point move on quit decribing a simple thing with ten different words and making us suffer. the charcters and story line are acceptional but this is one story that could easily make a movie and have little side effects because of how much she lets us know how things look."
5,Amazing Work of Literature!,"I am not a fan of reading, but I tried this book out anyway. I immediately fell in love with White Oleander and the characters. They were described so perfectly to a way which I could see them in my own mind. The work of it was so realistic to a way which teenagers act in situations dealing with sex, drugs, ect. With the plot uniquely set, this book is my all time favorite book. This was the first book to inspire me on reading and it has still been my favorite since."
2,It started out good...,"It started out cool and calm, like still water, but after Ingrid was put in jail, the book went downhill. Some parts of it were so slow and unmoving i wanted to stop. It disgusted me. But the book was like a drug, i wanted to go back and finish the rest of it. See what would happened to Astrid. And figure out what she wanted from life. The way the author strung the words together was elaborate. Otherwise i probably wouldn't have finished it."
5,This was a book I read without realizing I was reading.,"Each page of this book painted a picture. While not realizing I had read a single word, my mind focussed on pictures both terrible and disturbing on every page. It was a book I could not bear to read and could not bear to put down. There is hardly a day that some scene from this book does not appear in my mind's eye. I eagerly await her next endeavor."
2,Does anyone need an almost new book?,"I started this book and simply couldn't finish it. I kept imagining the mother to look like Glen Close in Fatal Attraction (her actions were even more far fetched). I have read lots of ""dark"" books but this one held no attraction for me. I simply didn't care for the characters."
4,An intimate portrait of Mothers Aura,"White Oleander provides an example of how life's occurances can affect us all, and how lucky some of us are to escape them. This book proves one of our greatest fears to be true: that we are at the mercy of fate. Astrid's struggle with escaping her heritage makes each reader acutely aware and grateful that our mothers aura is inescapable. A wonderful book."
4,So good you'll forgive it for its weaknesses.,"Very lyrical novel about a young girl whose brilliant but mentally ill mother murders an ex-boyfriend and winds up in prison for life. The girl is bounced around from horrible foster family to horrible foster family while trying to figure out who she is, who her mother is, and who they are to become. Some of the writing seemed heavy-handed to me, and some of the plot seemed unnecessarily manipulative. However, I couldn't put this book down -- the prose is so good that breaking it up by putting it down was almost impossible. I wanted to keep the flow going. Very depressing look at foster care, but an uplifting look at the strength young women in difficult situations can pull up from within themselves."
5,Heart Wrenching,"White Oleander was written with so much passion that many times I had to re-read sentences. It is very poetic even with some of the deepest moments in Astrid's plight to survive foster care. Never, would I have imagined the horrible trauma that foster care could hold for a young girl. Her Mother was a complete lunatic for not protecting Astrid, & does not deserve her love."
2,What ?,"This is the most over-rated book I've ever read. It can't hold a candle to ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""The Reader"" or ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" or ""The Testament"" or any of another dozen fine novels out this summer."
2,It was a bore,"I bought this book because most of the books Oprah has recommened have been very good. This one however left me wanting much more. "" Why"" thats what I wanted to know. Why did Astrid's mother mistreated her so badly? What happened in her life to make her the kind of evil woman she was. Why if Astrid's birth was planned why wasn't she maternal toward her.? Was it because her husband lost interest so that gave her the right to neglect and dislike Astrid? What's going on? Didn't care for this book at all."
2,Fair but boring at times.,The story starts out slow and eventually gets interesting only to become dull at the end. The story dragged on at times and I was waiting for something to happen. It seems to me that the author could have told the same story in half the number of pages. Not a book I would highly recommend and I was surprised Ophrah recommended it highly.
5,My Adamant Two Cents,"For all of you who perceived this book to be focused on the bruised and abused children of this society, you must not have read the book at all- and if you think that Astrid Magnussen is a character that was meant to be pitied, i believe that she'd throw that pity up your wazoo. The characters are incredibly well-developed and enchanting, the subject material stark and identifiable; i appreciated the little inflections of great literature throughout the book, as well.. her thoughts are impressively portrayed, mature, sarcastic and sadistically funny at times. as embarrassing as it is to favor a choice of a book club, White Oleander has nevertheless come to be one of my favorite pieces."
5,White Oleander,"I wasn't exactly looking forward to reading this at first. I went to the bookstore to buy something else, but I'm thrilled that they were sold out of the other book. This is the most beautiful piece of fiction I have read in a long time. The character Astrid is so real, so raw. The way she changes, the way her emotions swing, and the pure artistry of her voice is amazing. Each charcter has a distinct voice, which is rare for modern day writers to pull off. Also, Astrid's blossoming through her sexual experiences, pains, love and observance of human nature is gripping and touching. I loved everything about this book, the vivid descriptions and the painful beauty in everything. A must read for men and women alike."
4,Poetic yet disappointing,"I found this book to be very beautiful, and poetically written. I believe the author put a lot of detail and work into this novel with her descriptive words. I feel that it it was an informative story of one child's life as she grew up in a cruel system. Yet, as a fosterparent I was very disappointed in the portrayal of fosterparents and the representation of the caseworkers and other individuals who are involved in caring for children while they are in fostercare. With many professions, there are individuals who should not be in the type of work they are in. Yet, for the many who devote their time, patience, heart and families to such a demanding career, it is often degrading to us as foster parents who do our utmost to help neglected, abandoned or abused children. When only negative situations are portrayed in the media, it gives society a distorted view of all foster homes and cripples our reputation as meaningful assets to the world of lost and forgotten children."
1,"I was fascinated, why would Ophra narrate such trash?","I would be more careful about Ophra""s recommdations. I bought the taped book, by the third tape I pulled my car over and threw it out the window It sounded like the Saturday nite news that happened to six people. Do the people really need this trash to be entertained?"
2,Amateurish prose,"At some point, Janet Fitch must have taken a creative writing class that urged students to cram an awkward simile into every single sentence. For example, when one character tosses a pen to, she writes ""The pen stuck in the tabletop like a javelin."" I tried tossing a pen across the room to see if this comparison fit. Sure enough, my little ball-point grew to the size of a telephone-pole and smashed through the table's surface, sticking out at a crazy angle. I had never noticed that phenomenon before. Kudos to Janet Fitch for her keen powers of observation!"
2,A promising beginning but after that...,"not so much. I was intrigued by the characters at first and the idea that the mother would actually murder this man. For some reason, maybe because the prose was so whimsical and romantic, I thought perhaps Ingrid wouldn't get caught. Of course she does, which leaves us with Astrid.Astrid on her own is a lot less compelling. I find it strange that during this coming-of-age story the changes in her body, a normal part of adolescence, are never once mentioned. She has no qualms about pregnancy even though she, if I recall correctly, engages in unprotected sex a number of times.I guess I just wasn't too interested in her. This book was highly recommended but I was quite disapointed in it. I'm glad I got it from the library. Listening to it on tape eased the pain somewhat because if I fell asleep I didn't miss much."
1,Horrible,"I'd give this no star if I could. I can't believe Oprahrecommended this book getting the National Book Award. The story isvery boring and slow moving. The prose is hardly lovely. And the characters don't undergo any great change by the end- esp. the mother/daughter dilemma. Is that really resolved as is written? If you want a languid book with 'liquid poetry' with a slow moving story that you can't put down, then read Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha. Or The Grapes Of Wrath. Or The God of Small Things Or Moghul Buffet by Cheryl Benard. This book is a sheer waste of time. I can't emphasize that enough!"
1,DISSAPOINTING AND DEPRESSING,"I tried to read this book, and I hated it. It was so depressing and too melodramatic, and far fetched. Ingrid goes through a string of foster homes with all strange characters. The writing is too poetic and the story is depressing and boring with too many holes in it. It made you feel sad when you read it. It belongs in a soap opera. Hated this book. I don't know why Oprah picked this one since it's so terrible. LOSE THIS BOOK and SAVE YOUR MONEY and it's way too long also."
1,1 star only because she finished it.,"you asked we not be profane or obscene even tho. the book was. Miss winfrey said it was the best bookshe ever read. I should have sent her a sympathy card. she surely didn.t mean it. I gave my copy to the local library. I didn,t want in my collectionbe careful who reads it if you have it."
1,great book.,"This book is amazing. Reading ti puts you in a trance, you can write better after reading this book.Touching, and believable."
2,Great start weak ending,"I really enjoyed the begining of this book. I thought the first part of the novel had a good story and was touched by Astrid's problems.However, by the time she entered the third home the story became another typical Oprah novel. The imagery becomes syrupy and forced and the end once again glorifies marginality.More problematic is the charcters transformations. Fitch does not potray the evolution of these charcters in a belivable manner."
4,Dark and dangerous..handle with caution..,the people in this book are DANGEROUS!!!! no really!!! Ingrid ( the mom) is scary as hell and Astrid (her daughter) is pretty weird. very erotic novel. oh yeah there's obsessive love and possibly murder (gasp!) nothing really goes right for poor little Astrid who goes from family to family as her mother is in Jail and can no longer take care of her. Did mommy ever love her?? Did mommy ever kill that foolish man??? Who IS Astrid?? Where's her daddy???? these are the questions the book poses. very good. i encourage you read this.
4,Great Book!,"A beautifully written novel! Fitch's best work yet! This novel shows what it is like for a child in a foster home, not only the lifestyle, but also the mental damage that is caused. A young girl is forced to survive without birth parents; she believed her mother to be an amazing woman and she looked up to her. Only after her mother being thrown in jail for murder of and ex lover, did she realize that her mother was the enemy. This was a memorable book, and it is one of those can't put it down kind of stories. Fitch shows how you never know the truth about something or someone until you are forced to live without it. This book explores issues such as sexual, mental, and physical abuse. The young girl finds herself in many difficult situations and grows a little more with each one. Fitch is a great writer and this book is a must read!JF"
3,Aryan Motherhood,"Well, this book will hold your interest. There's much about Los Angeles, my ""beloved"" hometown, and all of that is authentic. What's not authentic is the little girl, Astrid, who thinks like a polyglot graduate student with great writing skills. Reminds me of the author a little bit. I just can't believe she's such a genius, Astrid, I mean. But if you are willing to suspend belief (and who isn't, reading a novel, after all, not a biography), then you just imagine what would happen if: You have an abandoned 13 year old cycling through various foster homes, which 13 year old happens to have the mind of a 27 year old writer. Wheeee...it's fun....but I guess I just hoped that it was more autobiographical....the good, the bad, and the real, you know.....Diximus."
2,Too easy to put down...,"If you have limited reading time and you have read every Oprah book, this is perfect for you. I found this book too easy to put down... easy to only read on weekends. I was relieved when it was over."
3,Lost me at the end,"White Oleander started out good, but the last 1/4 of the book...around the time Astrid is placed with Claire....it got slow and dull.I didn't like how Astrid blamed all her problems on her Mom.I didn't care for all the ""artsy"" stuff in this book either. I'm not a poetry person."
2,waste of time,"This book is easy to put down. There is no excitment or any anticipation in it. It is a well written B O R E ,"
5,absolute best book I've ever read,"I read this book for the first time about a year ago, and since then, I've thought about it every day. Fitch is an astounding author. She does the best job of any author I've ever read at developing a plot and breathing life into her characters. Astrid and Ingrid are so tangible that I almost feel as if they are real people trapped in a novel. Perhaps I'm just a little too neurotic, but the compulsion to free them is, at times, hard to quell. There is not a soul in the world who shouldn't read this astounding novel."
3,Poor Astrid,"I read this book, and was disappointed. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I was sorely disappointed. Did cheer for Astrid the whole time. The ending was abrupt and awful in my opinion! I wasn't sure whether to feel bad or scared for her half the time in all the different homes. I don't like reading about drugs etc so this wasn't the book for me! I think she gave up in the end and for that I am very disappointed!"
3,too drawn out,"This book was so drawn out that I skipped over the philosophical parts of it. It was a well written story, but I found Finch getting too caught up with the mom,s phycho mind. The main character was good & strong & without her insight the story got boring. Overall, a great read though."
3,Flowery language alone does not make good literature!,"I finished this book about a month ago and can remember feelinga little sense of shock once I had finished. Shock because I don'tthink I've ever finished a book before and had very little understanding of what had just happened. Fitch's flowery language is at times overbearing and rather than ""liquid poetry"" is more like a piece of food that's gone down the wrong way. There are enough things in it to give it a passing grade however, but only just!!!"
5,A very moving story!,"I loved this book! I found Janet Fitchs' writing style to be mesmerizing! It will change the way you think about foster care and make you want to reach out and do something. And to the readers who found it depressing and the ending a let-down, well, shame on you! If you want boring sappy happy stories try Danielle Steele! I found the end was a perfect closing to a beautiful story that reads like a song."
4,Facinating!!,"When Oprah announced the book I was thrilled! Her excitement about the book drew me to it. I had already ordered it as I do for each month, but was glad to hear it would be such an intriging novel. I found the story not only entertaining and lyrical, but I found it heartwarming and I felt myself feeling Astrids pain and joys! I loved how she adapted to each of her foster homes and how she became stronger with each placement. I think many would be amazed that what she went through IS what many go through in the foster care system. I hope not, but I believe that it probably is true to some. The ending left you wondering it was not packaged up in a tidy bow which so many think all books should have. Life does not happen that way so why should a novel? Thank you Janet Finch for a great read!!"
3,good not great ----over rated an understatement----,"i quickly developed a love/hate connection with the characters. half way through i found myself asking aloud, "" is anything good going to happen to this child?"" I thought the ending was, rather weak and things resolved themselves to simply for such complex issues that were introduced through out. you will enjoy it. hopefully. do not exspect too much, i did."
5,Loved It,"The book never had a dull moment, I couldn't put it down. I love the way the author described people, moments etc. (except how many times she talked about the hot wind) Looking forward to Janet's next novel."
3,The book started out with a bang!,"I would rate this book 3 out of 5 stars. It began with a bang and held me as a captive audience. I absolutely loved the author's descriptive writing. However, as a story plot, it soon lost my interest and I put it down. BUT I discovered I would be late returning it to the library, and hating to return an unfinished selection, I continued to read. I figured the ending, but was left wanting more!?!"
4,Brilliantly contrived.,"White Oleander was exquisite. A must read for lovers of contemporary fiction. The insight of the main character Astrid was remarkably profound.Fitch ingeniously portrayed Astrid's resilience. Astrid's mother Ingrid possessed a unique insight into the human condition and her intelligence was abundantly evident by the manner in which she was immersed in abstract thought. Fitch's presentation of Ingrid was nothing short of phenomenal. White Oleander redefines the very notion of beauty. If you liked Where the Heart is by Billie Letts, you'll love White Oleander."
3,Mediocre,"I agree with the reviewer who was disappointed in this book and suggested reading THE LAST DAY or THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD I loved those books very much as well. White Oleander just seemed so contrived, with wooden characters and a very biased approach."
5,Lyrical,"A captivating read...it was impossible for me to put this book down. The prose was incredible, beautiful...made me want to climb inside it's pages and wrap those lovely words around me."
4,A haunting and powerful read,"This book is amazing - Janet Fitch keeps you hanging on until the final page - I was completely unable to put it down!, and it stayed with me for days when I was done. I became completely absorbed by Astrid's life, wanting to know what would happen to her next - she experiences the ultimate highs and lows on her journey that very often had me smiling and crying with her. What she goes through is depressing, dark, amusing, uplifting, and altogether incredible, and it never goes beyond the realm of believability. I haven't seen the film yet, but I can only hope that it does this book justice. A must-read for anyone!"
5,Absolutely beautiful story,This is one of my favorite books of all times. i have read it 5 times. i have told several friends who have since read and loved this book too. the main character Astrid goes thru terrible struggles and still comes out on top. i would recommend this book to anyone (and i do!)
3,Give Me a Break!,"I am embarassed to say I could not put this book down. I found it to be fascinating and well-written. However, the story itself was so over-the-top, it was ridiculous. Giv me a break -- anyone who had been through what our little heroine had been through would certainly have enough sense to take the money and run. Another story of misery and heartache. I need a David Sedaris fix!"
4,Amazing how childhood environment shapes your life,"This book is a good example that the environment you grow up in shapes your views of yourself and what you think you deserve in the future. Many people are able to overcome adversity and seek something better for themselves, but many can not. Astrid doesn't believe she deserves better than what she has and never seeks to rise above only to make do with what she has. A sad reflection of a lot of lives. Misery truly is what you make it."
2,I was disappointed after hype.,"I read a lot and looked so forward to this highly reviewed book. Sorry, but it just didn't do it for me. I found it depressing to the extreme. And once the plot was set, there just wasn't enough challenge of interest."
4,heartwarming,"I felt that White Oleanders was a very well written book about the dsyfunctional life of Astrid. When purchased I did not know what to expect, but I found myself unable to put the book down. At points through out the book I found my self feeling anger and at other times feeling joy for Astrids courage. I look forward to any future writings by the Author Janet Fitch."
1,Save your money,"Take the overall average with a grain of salt. I was notimpressed with White Oleander. The lyrical writing everyone ravesabout felt forced and over-done to me. Parts of the story were hard to believe and others down right ridiculous.Save your money for Hannibal or 'Tis, when they are released."
3,Rave reviews may be a disappointment to some!,"I have read and studied a fair amount of literature and am amazed at the rave reviews of this one. Yes, I concede this is a good book. I also agree that the author has a talented way with words. Yet, I have trouble with the overall voice of the novel. The beginning is from a 12 year-old's perspective but is certainly not written in a 12 year-old's voice. I found that I had to suspend belief far too often to appreciate this main character. Does no one else think this? Granted, by the time she is a teenager her voice is more believable and hence why I continued reading. I think the personal issues and level at which one relates to the story strongly impact how one feels about this book. Overall a good read but going into it with the reviews here and from Oprah caused me to be disappointed."
1,What a piece of trash!,"Janet Fitch appears to have only had about 2 good chapters in her, after that she goes down hill rapidly. I am an English Literature major and by the fourth chapter I felt ashamed to be reading this book. If you like the writings of V.C. Andrews you will probably love this book. I can't for the life of me understand what people see in it. The writing is drippingly sentimental and the plot is like something off of a daytime soap opera, only worse. I wish Oprah would recommend truly good writers rather than brainwashing people into believing this kind of trash is great literature."
2,Well crafted Pulp Fiction,"We see it on television, the movies, the newsmedia, and the tabloids...now we have another forced feeding account of the Bad parent/Bruised child in the form of a novel. Fitch writes well and draws characters realistically. It is a shame such talent is squandered on a soap opera story. How many more of these ""down and out deserted kids"" tales will be written? A depressing read without redemption, BUT this author has the skills down well."
1,Oleander Schmoleander,"I can not tell you how much I disliked this book! It wasn't so much the narrative that I disliked, but the actual plotline. I found myself thinking that the main character was overdramatized and boring. The only aspects I enjoyed in White oleander were the vivid descriptions the author gave for characters and settings. However, overall I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Please do not waste your time.,I was so excited to read this book. I had to force myself to keep reading until the end. It really stunk.
3,Exhausting Read,"White Oleander was at the top of my ""must read"" list, but by the time I finished reading this book I was mentally exhausted. The constant use of foreign languages and metaphors were a bit extreme. Toward the end (last 3 or 4 chapters), I wanted the story to hurry up and end. Nevertheless, the story of a manipulative, selfish mother and the daughter that just wanted to be accepted by her should be told. The story also lets readers peek into the horrific situations that children sometime encounter in foster care systems."
4,Survivor,"I found this book to be very enlightening. It's hard to believe that one young girl could be so misplaced numerous times in a foster system that is supposed to nuture poor innocent children. Fitch did a remarkable job writing this story through the thoughts and eyes of the victim, Astrid. Although Astrid was put into some awful circumstances, she grew to understand herself more through these times..and eventually survive all on her own..without her wicked Mother."
2,Disappointing ending and too many similies,"This book was recommended to me by a bookstore owner. I couldn't put the book down - true. I really wanted to see how it would end and felt that it was building to this big surprise ending. For instance, all of a sudden Astrid remembers this girl Annie but can't remember much about her. And then there's the loose ends with her father. I didn't feel satisfied with how those issues were resolved. I felt cheated. And, Fitch uses too many similies. After reading this book and Memoirs of a Geisha (which I truly did like) I wonder if authors think they aren't good writers unless they fill their books with loads of similies. It gets tiring and distracting! As one other reader critized ""After a while I just rolled my eyes."""
3,Histrionic Drama,"While I admire the research behind this first novel, and I was presdisposed to love it based on reviews and the movie performance of the actress who played Astrid, I found the book more than a litle too flowery and overwrought - like the author was showing off all her skills just in case she doesn't get another chance.Also, between ""Lovely Bones"" and ""White Oleander"", what's up with 13 year old girls being sexually destroyed by older men?A disquieting theme."
2,Dashed hopes,"I really would like to write a great review for this book, but walked away feeling let down everytime I read it. I loved Astrid, but felt her character inconsistent, even for a teenager. I loved Ingrid, but didn't get enough of her to improve this read. Everyone else was just a flash in the pan of dark decaying life. There is so little beauty in this book. Astrid becomes so scarred, both emotionally and physically, that the puny ending hardly could be interpreted as a triumph. I had hoped the movie would redeem the book, and aside from a stellar cast, it too was a great disappointment in unfulfilled potential. To Janet Fitch: this had all the makings of a legendary Mother-Daughter journey, but lacked sincerity and true depth of character. I'm very glad that others had a better interpretation, but as much as I tried to love this book, I just could not."
4,"an intense, highly personal yet uneven memoir...","It is easy to see why 'White Oleander' received so many positive reviews on amazon.com. The plot, about a teenaged girl is left to foster care after mother is convicted of murder, is brought to life through extremely rich prose and characterizations. The overall story is very believable, and very depressing. However I'm not giving this book five stars because:- the author somewhat overcooks the story with too many psychotic characters and minor plot embellishments. Some careful editing could have saved a hundred pages and would have been greatly beneficial.- the book starts off much better than how it ends. The beginning focused on the strange relationship between the girl and her mother, and the prose is magnificent and sensual. Yet this all fizzles as the book progresses. The last third of 'White Oleander' is really just ordinary, nothing special.Bottom line: certainly an enjoyable, thought-provoking read. Recommended."
1,White Oleander,PLEASE! What trash! This book only merits one star because the author at least got it published. This book was a total WASTE and I mean WASTE of time. Is this what American literature is coming to?
5,A must read for all women!,"Wow! I had a hard time putting the book down. If you are looking for a good beach read, this is it!"
2,White Oleander,"This was a beautifully written book. However, the content was morbid and depressing. I finished it only because I enjoyed the writing style."
4,compelling yet too thin,"I found this book had a similar problem to Wally Lamb's ""i know this much is true"" lots of story, plenty of characters, lots of style, but not enough substance. Nonetheless, it's worth reading because it's enjoyable, entertaining and has a few moments of beauty. Not enough to hold it together though."
2,Bleck!,"I couldn't get past the obnoxious, pretentiously ""artsy"" writing style to finish this book. After five chapters, I put it down in disgust. This is something I'd expect someone in English 101 to write. Eeeewwww! Definitely sophomoric. I wish you better luck with it."
5,A generous writer...,"This is a writer who gives all of herself, no holds barred. That is very inspiring to another writer, and I'm grateful. What Fitch does is to burrow deeply into the feelings of the narrator instead of just telling us about them. I appreciate that. She's a master already - a genius with words. I'm much older and writing novels myself, but I don't think I'll ever write with the fluidity - and self confidence - of this young woman. Bravo!"
3,"Tragically realistic, heartbreaking","I was anxious to read this book, only knowing it had to do witha girl in a foster care setting. I am a current foster parent. Thisstory is tragically realistic and incredibly sad. I feel the sexual misconduct of Astrid was dwelled upon far to much. That is my only complaint. I was intrigued enough to keep reading, although it was not a fast read with its ""wordyness"". I have written down many quotes I did like from the book and my vocabulary has never been increased by one book as much as ""White Oleander."" Is is sad that our society is not aware of the torment that foster children go though. We need caring ""watchdogs"" to oversee that these horrible things do not continue to happen to our children. I have not reccomended this book to others, I am not sure that my peers could handle the harsh truth that this book brings out."
5,page turning poetry,"I'll never forget Astrid and her mother. What a magnificent feat to bring these people to the page. I'm an author of young adult books, myself, and plan to order Janet Fitch's Y.A. novel, entitled KICKS. She obviously knows about the heart of a teenager. And also looking forward to reading her next book. And the next and the next."
5,Praises for White Oleander,White Oleander was wonderful. I couldn't put it down. Even at though I have never experienced foster care the author told the story so well I felt as though I had lived my life the way Astrid did. The book drew me in everyway possible. I had to take a few weeks off reading books because none of the ones I started compared to this one. I recomend it highly.
4,Realistic with good ending,"I was preparing myself for another sappy tale of woe, and was pleasently surprised by this book. It keep me reading with interest all the way through. It is a quick read, but it leaves you thinking about it between chapters. After working with foster children I can tell you that this book is realistic, and if anything, a little on the nice side. There was very little sexual abuse, which made it easier for me to read, although that is one unrealistic part. I did try to imagine that maybe as an older, more mature foster child, Astrid was able to avoid the sexual abuse that is common place among foster children.I was waiting patiently for the ending and I can say that it does not let you down. I was happy to see that the book had a real message and did not have a simple happy-ever-after ending. It really makes the book worth reading."
3,Enthralling...but depressing,"I found this book extrememly interesting, and it flowed almost like a soap opera. There are several episodes of Astrid's life included in this coming-of-age novel. The character development was excellent, you could almost see (and smell) the characters according to Fitch's detailed descriptions. However, I found that Astrid was a difficult character to call a heroine because she was inconsistently brave and weak. At times she seemed worn down into resignation, other times she seemed resolved and stronger by her experiences. I was a bit disappointed in the end to find her still so wishy-washy about life and men. However, I can't help but think that the author intended to end the book on an uncertain note- no happily ever after. This book is definitely well-written and a page-turner, but don't look for Astrid to be some kind of role model or inspiring character, because her role appears to be the eternal victim."
4,Emotionally taxing but smart and engaging.,"I respect Oprah's attempts at choosing books that focus on women in all facets of life and agree that this is a good book for her list. However, I found the tale incredibly taxing.The story follows Astrid, a young girl forced into the foster care system after her mother poisons her lover with oleander. Astrid is bounced from home to home, finds love in some families and resentment in others. She learns how to survive both physically from a gunshot and emotionally from watching the only foster mother she loved die.While I enjoyed watching Astrid struggle and endure, I was saddened by the fact that this is probably not far from reality for many kids today. Although Astrid had a lot of scars from the system, she probably turned out better than many, if not most, kids faced with similar plights."
4,A nice fast read,"I really liked this book alot. It wasn't the greatest novel i've ever read, but it was a nice read. You can't rush through it though because the writer has a unique way of describing things. You don't want to miss anything. I definitely recomend this for anyone. You really get attached to Astrid."
3,Pleasant Summer Read.....,"White Oleander is a pleasant summer read with a host of characters to identify with. I found that while reading this book I actually cared about the main character, Astrid. This has been a problem for me in the past. How interesting to write a novel where the main character's thorn is her mother!!!"
2,WELL-WRITTEN BUT DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH LIKE I DID,I like the way she writes; however it is difficult to believe that all foster homes are that bad. I didn't like the ending either; maybe too much time spent on the poetry (got long).It was a depressing book. I can't believe Oprah talked so highly of it. I'm glad I didn't buy it just borrowed from library.
3,Beautifully written story but the main character seemed flat,"The writer of this novel had a wonderful way of spinning the story but I could not conjure a permanent mental picture of the main character, Astra....she never stayed with me in spite of her many scars both physical and mental. Her jailed mother was so much more vivid a character and I wished the same could be said of Astra. Still, a good summer read!"
1,Offensively bad,"This book makes me ashamed to be female. It is a perfect example of character-as-accumulated trauma. Like, the part where Astrid gets attacked by dogs? Come ON. Someone send Oprah a copy of the Crying of Lot 49 already. That has a tortured female heroine too; maybe she'll dig it. Know that I would never have read this book unless forced."
1,It goes into the trash.,Pelple may have to live this way but I feel dirty reading it. I should have stopped sooner but keep thinking there is some redeeming qualities to find. I am almost finished and have found none so far. I wonder if I am alone in my opinion.
4,Beautifully written...,"The author's language is beautiful and impressive. Although the story is slightly depressing and cynical, the underlying messages are incredible and well worth the read. The language is a little hard to wade through for less seasoned readers, however I felt that it added a dimension to the story that enhanced the overall impact. Don't read this one with Oprah in mind, read it for yourself! It is an incredible novel!"
5,Pure magic....,"Janet Fitch has written the most inspiring, beautiful, magically written book i have ever read.""White Oleander"" is my favorite book, i haven't read a book so cleverly written for ages, she is truely a gifted soul.white Oleander tells a story of a young girl 's life and the many disturbing and difficult situations she endures.You will fall in love with Astrid the main character and find it hard to come up with a wrod for her mother, you will feel through this storytelling how it feels to be Astrid, this book will grab at you and it won't let you forget, i loved it!"
2,The Most Depressing Book I have ever read.,The book was extremely well written but left me very upset
3,"This book had promise, but failed in the end","My friend told me that this book was a must read and in the past, she has always been right. Unfortunately, White Oleander reeled me in, but left me out at sea. The writing is wonderful and the main story is interesting. However, in the middle of the book, I felt like the author packed up and left this story. She wasted what could have been truly magical!"
3,a sensory experience,"What I liked most about this book was the prose. I liked how Fitch described scenes so vividly you felt you were staring through the window. This was especially true of the scenes with Olivia and Claire. However, the plot was too contrived. I agree with some readers that there were too many metaphors and too many cliches, especially of beautiful women being thin and elegant and having a distinguishing smell. I kept expecting the Chanel No. 5 woman to show up. Fitch does a good job of showing the reader how Astrid changes from a 12 year-old naive girl to a cynical 20-something, but Fitch's writing of Astrid's suffering seemed layered. One horrible scene piled on top of another without causing any permanent damage. My recommendation is enjoy the writing and look beyond the plot."
4,Absorbing,"It was a little tiring to read--and live!--through Astrid's life in the book. She experienced so many things that most people don't usually go through at her young age. But it sure was an amazing, and well-written, journey. It is not at all difficult to get pulled into the narrative of this teenage heroine.Overall, White Oleander is a very entertaining read and I would've given it five stars. The only thing that felt a little out of balance to me was the ending. Although it is a nice one that helps readers breathe easy after all the events in the book, I felt like all the excitement at the beginning of the book vanished just like that 3/4 of the way, leaving me a little high and dry. But maybe that was the point, to have Astrid settle into a life so unlike what she had at first, that the dissipation of excitement is really just a device to get that point across.I recommend this book for a mix of intellectual and emotional reading."
1,I thought a plot was a vital part of literature.,"The only reason I completed this novel was shere diligence. Not only were there very few likeable characters in the book, their actions were as unlikeable as they were. I am stunned that Oprah believes this is one of the best books she has ever read. This book read like a diary. One event following another, but nothing was ever resolved or no lessons were ever learned. To me, there was no point to the book. I am disappointed I wasted time and money on this book. Janet Fitch better thank Oprah for making her a best-selling writer, because her book certainly didn't make her one."
3,"Just This Once, Abridged is Ok","The novel really picks up momentum as you get into it. It feels as though there are several stories going on at once. Every time Astrid goes to a new home a new segment of her life begins, marked with sadnesses of her previous lives.The beginning is not really all that exciting. At times the story seems wordy and too circumspect. It goes too far with the main character, Astrid, thinking so much about what is going on around her.On the other hand, I think that the abridged tapes, read by Oprah Winfrey, are the perfect format to appreciate this book. Oprah lends just the right quality of tone and weight to the words. Also, with so much introspection on the part of the main character, this abridged version has the right mix of action and drama."
5,"Silken writing, striking story",I simply love this book. Have read it 2X and listened to it on tape. The 'voice' of the main character is spot-on. Intense and hypnotic and thoroughly readable book.
3,Well...,"This book had good points, and bad points. I admire the character development of Astrid, but feel that it faltered towards the end. I also admired character development of Ingrid, Claire, and Yvonne. Everyone else, however, seemed a bit too typecast, stereotypical, exaggerated. Starr, Marvel, and Ron fit too neatly into little packaged boxes that left no room for real expansion or development, or even any positive characteristics.The social commentary of the foster system in our country was quite fascinating, as were the insights into the impact mothers have on daughters.I also took issue with the metaphor upon metaphor and excessive use of similes. Some sentences were more simile than content. I appreciate the poetry of Ms. Fitch's language, but I also think that it should have been edited down to give the truly potent statements more punch.Overall I'd say this was an okay book, but not one that I truly liked."
3,"Great potential, but a let-down of an ending.","The beginning was very mind-catching. I believe that the middle was the absolute best, especially when she lived with Claire. The greatest potential of the story was at that point. Unfortunately, everything beyond that was nothing but a let-down. It seemed as if the worst of the book was repeating itself."
4,Starkly Written,"Beautiful yet searingly harsh at times (like Astrid), the writer does an amazing job of conveying the confusion underlying Astrid's life. The writer is remarkably versatile in painting each chapter with distinctly different hues, and in providing detail on the very diverse communities in Southern California. A wonderful read."
3,"In depth, depressing, however, hard to put down","White Oleander was a great book to read. It was slightly depressing as you followed a young girl in search of herself. Often, you see this young girl ""fail,"" which makes the reader feel terrible for her. The writing is supurb -- Janet fitch used her intense writing capability to enhance the reader. It isn't the most cheerful book in the world, but a definite one to read!"
2,"Very depressing, way too long, somewhat unbelievable story.","I looked forward to reading this book, found it only in hardback and paid the high price for it at a local warehouse store. What a mistake. It was totally depressing, a very hard read and was not of interest to me at all. I have now read at least 5 of Oprah's best picks and this one is by far the worst. I still have a hard time believing Oprah or anyone 'recommends' this book....ah well, to each his own!"
1,Very disturbing material.,"I bought this book after Oprah raved about it on her show and when I got to page 68 I decided to return the book. The contents I found to be disturbing, and depressing and haunting. Not an enjoyable book at all. There is enough sadness and trouble in the world now without reading about another hardship. Wouldn't recommend this for those who are emotional or very sensitive."
3,Very Average Read,"This book really was just OK. It was about 100 pages too long, and by the end I didn't really care too much about what was going to happen to the characters. It was rather predictable, as well as a little unbelievable. That said, it's an easy read and won't strain the mind. I wouldn't rush out to buy the book, as some previous reviewers said they would. Very average."
4,Well written.,"I found this book to be enjoyable, realistic, and very well written. I do admit that I picked this up because it was an Oprah pick. The only other Oprah pick I have read was 'The Reader' and I hated it. I really liked this book though. I am surprised that Oprah would pick this book as well as the other I read, though. She's so into looking into our spirit and lifting ourselves up and these books didn't really make me feel enriched after reading them. White Oleander was a very good read, but I don't feel it left me with anything other than a new outlook on the Foster Home environments and program. It is true that Astrid lifted herself up and recognized her worthiness, but even in the end, she is left wanting and sad. I do, though, recommend this book."
4,Beauty in Tragedy,"I loved this book. Every character was totally engaging and interesting. You cannot help but to fall in love with Astrid and feel her pain, sorrow, hope and longing. Every word is carefully chosen and perfectly placed."
3,PRETTY GOOD,THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK. IT WAS A LITTLE TOO POETIC AND A LITTLE TOO GRAPHIC WITH THE SEXUAL DETAILS.
1,So depressing - nothing to enjoy - not for me!,"Because this was Oprah's overwhelming recommendation, I thought it would be great. Iwaited and waited as I read the book, for onedecent thing to happen to the ""star"" of the story. It was just too much sadness and couldsee no reason for the story at all."
4,Great read; saw the movie first.,I was always curious about the book because I have watched the movie numerous times. It was great and received fast and promp service on my book. Thanks!
4,"Hard to put down, a bit anti-climactic","Love this book, read it in three days, just couldn't put it down. I was a bit disappointed in the ending. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect but without beging a spoiler, it seemed a bit flat. Janet Fitch's words are fluid, poetic, beautiful and ugly all at the same time. She is an amazing writer and I vividly imagined every scene she verbally painted. The characters were full, round, well defined, well described.Astrid's suffering is crucial to the plot. About 3/4 of the way through the book, you grow a bit tired of the sorrow though. The development of Astrid was amazing, you felt her growing up, learning lessons. She was a character, but as human and real as almost anyone you know.Good book! I love stories that you stay up too late just to read ""one more page,"" which becomes one more chapter. I just hoped for a bit more of closure, if not for Astrid's sake, for my own."
5,Lyrical...Poetic....Life,"An absolutely outstanding novel. Beautifully written. I read it in four days because I just could not put it down. This is a definite must read. I usually do not write reviews for books, but this one deserves a standing ovation."
4,A terrible life,"This is such a beautifully written book, full of pathos and half truths, telling the story of a beautiful girl and her equally beautiful mother. Scandinavian blondes, with startlingly blue eyes, the women attract attention from everybody, but the mother, Ingrid, is mentally flawed, living in a world of her own creation and writing poetry, which makes her a kind of cult figure. She poisons her lover after he is unfaithful to her and is sent to jail for a long sentence so that her daughter, Astrid, is placed in foster homes until she is 18 and able to fend for herself. Some of the foster parents are kind and well meaning while others who are in the program purely for the money they recieve, are mean, selfish and cruel, emphasising the aloneness and loneliness of the little girl. It's a stark read which points up the dangers facing a girl child alone in the world without a protector and the ease with which a child is able to slip into a world of squalor, sex and crime."
5,it's been a while,It has definitely been a while since I've read such a good book. I absolutely loved it...very poetic in her writing along with putting the reader right there in the moment. Can't wait to read another Janet Fitch book.
3,"At times dazzling, at times too close to soap opera","I enjoyed ""White Oleander"" and was fascinated by the hold Ingrid had on Astrid. Ingrid's a witch, but a smart one, a real ""modern."" Astrid is inspiring, brave, adaptable and, still, almost pathetic in her yearning for her jailed mother. Fitch is talented as hell, if overwrought, and comes dangerously close to having Fabio on the cover of the book at times. But her descriptions of the LA landscape were real and her next book should be something very good. One reviewer here wrote he didn't like the ""triumph of the spirit"" type books that Oprah recommends. But Fitch's book is more triumph of the will."
3,It was great til the ending,"I enjoyed this book a lot but... the ending was completely over the top unrealistic. I'm not going to give anything away here, and I know that the book is not pretending to be factual. However, the last few chapters felt disjointed from the rest of the story."
2,NOT WORTH ALL THE HYPE,"""White Oleander"" is the story of a mother (Ingrid) and daughter (Astrid). The mother being in prison for murder and the daughter being bounced from one foster home to another.Astrid's journey through life is interesting, but some parts could have been eliminated from the novel.I am not a fan of this STYLE of writng, within each chapter are paragraphs that span time (weeks,months,etc.), and just when certain parts get interesting the novel shifts, and it does this throughout most of the book. It seems as if the author tried to fit too much into the novel. Sometimes, LESS is MORE.""White Oleander"" has been hailed by critics and readers, as well as being an OPRAH pick.I don't usually read this type of novel, but with all the praise it has received, I gave it a chance. I wanted to like this book more than I did.The book is just an okay story that will hold your interest, but it is NOT a novel that will make a huge impact on you."
5,There really ARE bad people in the world,"I appreciated this book because it reveals the mind of a woman who is truly evil. She is intelligent, bent on teaching her daughter a 'true' set of values--her values. The mother, however, like most humans possessed by emotions, she is unable to jump over her own shadow and murders her lover. She is convicted of murder and imprisoned. Astrid, being young, has no identity of her own and assumes the values and world-views of her numerous foster families. It is fascinating and, I imagine, typical in foster children. I liked the fact that the author was not condescending, instead simply telling a story. The mother did, finally, ""let Astrid go"" but it was not cheesy whatsover..unlike the movie which turned this exquisite novel into a typical Hollywood heartstring puller. I look foward to Fitch's next novel."
4,Terrific! please read!,"Really, this is a genuine great pageturner. Why did I put it at three stars? I sadly must agree with the previous critic who gave it only one star on the basis that the book leans too much toward sadness. For a book which is supposed to be based on reality without any romance, it seems to romanticize only the sad parts of life, in very unreal order of events. At first I disagreed with this critic thinking ""this is simply a story about the sadder parts of life"" Later in the book I found it to be so unrealistic. However, the poetry, the description and the content are like nothing I've ever read. It is so unique and I absolutely love it. I have already taken excerpts and written them down in journals so as never to lose them. Many of them I've memorized. I am awaiting another book by Janet Fitch. Please read this book!"
2,a little disappointing,"It wasn't awful but I thought it suffered from lack of plot especially in the last third of the book. Maybe too chick-lit for this reader.I found Astrid's young character hard to track with and I'm not sure the author did a good enough job connecting her with a good storyline.The adult characters were well written (Ingrid, Clare and Star) and interesting and I was hoping something cool would resolve in the story, but nothing really did for this reader..."
4,"Great writing, but so improbable","It took me a few pages to become interested in this book, but once I did, it was hard to put down. Fitch is an excellent writer; however, the story she tells is incredibly improbable. That one foster child could be exposed to so many criminal situations and tragedies - and no one seem to notice or do anything about it - just seems impossible to me. My husband and I were foster parents to teenagers for ten years and had over 60 years experience in law enforcement. I can't imagine one child having such horrid placements one right after another. Yes, I've read horror stories about things that go on in foster care. But these situations actually became ridiculous - they were so outrageous to all happen to one child. And then for the main character's mother to magically be released from prison - it just didn't make sense to me."
5,"Haunting, difficult book will not leave you when you finish","This type of book is the most difficult to review. It is lyrical, with its poet-teen narrator and edgy feel. Yet it stretches your credulity to its limits as Astrid goes from one disasterous foster home to another--how many people will have that much trouble follow them before age 18? Yet Fitch manages to make you sorrow for her without resorting to pity. This alone makes it a great work. You will not forget it easily."
1,An inspiration for budding novelists everywhere,"Although it was a total piece of trash, this book did have one redeeming quality. It made me realize that if junk like this can get published, certainly I can write something publishable! The ""lyric"" writing was forced and annoying, the similes way overdone, and the situations improbable and ridiculous. I have to admit I enjoyed the first couple of chapters about Astrid and her mother, when their life was normal but pleasantly quirky. But then some murder, sexual abuse, and shootings were thrown in for obvious shock value and the book just went downhill from there. Oprah, what were you thinking? This was possibly her most ridiculous selection yet, and I've read ""Back Roads."""
2,Had Potential....,"I spent 3 months trying to finish the last 100 pages of this book. In the beginning, I was intrigued. I really got into it & was eagerly waiting for the story to thicken. Well, I'm still waiting. I got tired of the main character, Astrid's, attitude & actions. I tired of her mother descriptive letters & her thinking patterns. I thought the book was good in the beginning, but towards the end, it became so dull, I placed my copy on the shelf to collect dust."
5,White Oleander,"I have read a lot of books, but this book is one of my two favorites. I recommend it to anyone. I'll put it this way, I, 20, my Aunt, 45, and my Grandmother, 82, all loved this book! I think that many men would like it too. It may take a little bit to get into but it's more than worth it to stick with it. You've got to find something in the book to relate to. (My other favorite is Back Roads by Tawni O'Dell.)"
5,AM I LIVING IN LALA LAND?!,"THE BOOK IS GREAT AND ONE OF ITS KIND...SO WELL WRITTEN. HOWEVER, AM I LIVING IN ""LALA"" LAND OR IS AMERICAN SOCIETY SO DYSFUNCTIONAL? NOT ONE CHARACTER DOES NOT LIVE A DRAMA. AN EXTREMELY GLOOMY PICTURE OF MEN WHO BY THEIR IRRESPONSIBILITY TURN WOMEN INTO NERVOUS MURDEROUS WRECKS!NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OUR YOUNG GIRLS UNLESS YOU WANT TO TURN THEM INTO LESBIANS!....I AM SURPRISED THAN DESPITE ALL HER EXPERIENCES ASTRID CAN STILL FALL IN LOVE!"
5,Wow,"This book is amazing! It gets a little explicit in some parts, (some things that could be left to the imagination and don't need great description to add to the storyline), but it's still very enjoyable. Astrid's journey is well written, if a little unbelievable. Each phase of her life brings new, vibrant characters, and each is eventually left behind. As the protagonist grows, however, she takes a part of each home along with her. Astrid deals with issues of abuse, suicide, alcohol, drugs, prostitution, attempted murder, actual murder, and an older man/teenage girl sexual relationship- and while i'm sure these things probably have happened from time to time in foster homes, it's a little hard to believe they all happen to one girl in the span of 8 or 9 years.even so, each little segment is vividly described, and the whole picture is breathtaking. it's definately a good read"
3,Unrealistic and overly dramatic,"Just as many of the movie reviews have likened the film to a soap opera, I would agree that the same can be said for the novel. The story seems unrealistic and overly dramatic to me. The mother has no redeeming qualities and is infuriating in her desire to control/destroy her daughter. I read the novel because I like to read the book before seeing the movie. The novel took away my desire to see the film."
5,Wonderful,"Fascinating and sad by turns--enlightening about the world of foster children and foster care programs. Modern slavery cloaked as charity. The characters are so real, however, and the glimpses of lives I will never live (I hope)so engrossing, this will be a book I will remember for a long time. How sad that children are produced as carelessly as rabbits and cared for with less concern. Thank you, Janet Fitch, for this book."
3,Catchy,"After such a skillful crafting of the icy Ingrid (how I enjoyed seeing one of these aesthetic creatures who looks down on all the ordinary people of the world get her due)it a was a real disappointment to see Astrid devolve into such a cliche. The misunderstood, pierced, tattooed artist-punk living in her unheated Berlin flat toting her suitcase-art. There's no denying that she thought herself a pretty hip and cool victim and what luck that hip and cool victims are in style."
2,A simile lover's dream,"The story itself is interesting and somewhat engaging. However, the writing style drove me nuts. You really get a lot of similes and metaphores for the money. I mean a lot. So many similes that I felt compelled to drag out some old reference books to remember what a simile was."
5,Excellent and unforgettable,"This was a beautifully written book. The book was very uplifting in that it shows how someone can bring a positive result from even the most negative of circumstances. It gives hope and inspiration. This book has given me a much deeper appreciation for my own children and an insight to just how powerful an influence I am for them. I see the importance of making them feel secure in my love for them.The writing was so wonderfully descriptive; it forces you to ponder the beauty in the ordinary, as Astrid did in her artwork.This book has certainly changed the way I view life now; I see my many blessings. This was truly one of the best books I've ever read in my 44 years, and there have been many. Thank you Janet Fitch."
4,Beautifully written,"I loved the majority of this book and the way the writer wove her words, however I thought the ending was terrible. There could have been a thousand other ways (better ways!) Astrid could have turned out. But reading the rest of the book is definatley worth it."
4,Excellent use of language; horribly offensive,"This book has so many great qualities such as great character development, amazing imagery, use of simile, and interesting plot. I wanted to fight for Astrid and I wish she had said more sooner to her mother. I mean, I wish she had given her mother a piece of her mind earlier on. It was hard to believe a mother could be that way. Perhaps, that is why it held my attention. It was out of the ordinary for me. The characters were so interesting and developed, that I felt I knew them. Everything within the story was so vivid and colorful! I loved Fitch's use of language. However, (here comes my disappointment) I was highly offended by the time I got less than half way through the book. I had to put it down and I almost didn't pick it up again. The sexual descriptions were too much to bare. I found them disgusting and unneseccary to fill my mind with. But, I'm glad I continued to read and finished the book, ignoring the offensive."
4,This book is breath-taking in it's writing style.,"During the first 20 pages, I found the author too flowerly if that is a word. From then on I could scarcely put it down. I got it - whatever ""it"" means. Ms. Fitch used expressions I could hardly have fathomed. I would like to write a book and only hope I can do half as well. What I liked were the descriptions of scenes,, people's expressions, and lack of explicit sexual scenes. We don't need everything described for us. Astrid's mother was someone I would never want to meet except out of curiosity. She was unbelievably selfish. Why do some people have children? I esp. loved Claire. She was a born caretaker something I can relate to immensely."
3,WAY TOO MUCH HYPE!!!,Don't get me wrong...I did enjoy the book. I do think that Oprah hyped this book just a tad too much. I enjoyed the explicit use of description throughout the novel. It gave me a good mental picture of the setting. The only person I was unable to picture was the star of the book Astrid...it was hard to get a strong mental picture of what she looked like. I thought the author used too many liretary and film references that could make it hard for the average reader to follow. I really wish Oprah would pick a happy novel for once...they are all SOOO tragic. This book would be a good library read...not one I would buy.
2,Perils of Pauline Return,"Oprah has done it to us again. Astrid has soooo many bad experiences that they start to become unbelievable. The ending, too, reads like something that must be"" continued next week"" so that we really know what happens--a cheap trick in my book. Why must we always be exposed to the sadness of life in Oprah's choices? Is it because she needs guests that share the characters' experiences? Give me Ann Tyler or Gail Godwin any day."
5,amazing.,"One of the most amazing books I have ever read. I started reading it and could not put it down till I finished (litterally). Though the back makes it seem like a cliched annoying pre teen book, the writing clearly showed more. There is really not much I can say about this book without delving into the delicate web that it shows us. Wonderful wonderful WONDERFUL! I can't stress how much I enjoyed this book enough. Easy to relate to with the stress in the mother daughter relationship, easy to read, and good. Touching, wonderful, fantasic."
2,Somewhat Dissapointed,"Recently I began reading books from the Oprah bookclub. Some I could not put down other's I couldn't wait to finish, mostly because I was tired of them. ""White Oleander"" is one that I could not wait to finish. The first chapter of the book was excellent and enough to get me to purchase it; however, the more I read, the more boring it became. I got the point the Author was trying to make after the second home Astrid lived in. It was the relationship with the mother and daughter that intrigued me most and I must say I found the mother's character more interesting than Astrid herself. I wanted to enjoy this book so much but the only thing that kept me reading was the fact that my husband paid so much for it as a gift for me."
5,Loved this book!!,"I really enjoyed this book. I live LA and know of many of the cities and areas Astrid has been in. Reading about places you are familar with is pretty cool. I was also raised all my life in foster homes so I can relate a little to that part too. I realized how lucky I was that I was taken in by a great family instead of being sent to a group home or MacLaren. I attended a workshop on Independant Living that was offered to foster kids and met so many kids that have been through a lot of bad stuff, first they are taken away from their birth parents or thrown away then get tossed around to the system some getting into worse stuff. I read reviews saying all this bad stuff is written for shock value,and it was too depressing, I dont know why so many are surprised ;just look at the cover you can get an idea what goes on in the book."
3,Interesting but not what I expected. Strong Language.,"I stayed with the book even though I felt some of the language to be more than was needed. I have 5 adopted children, have met good, bad & indifferent foster families. I have a hard time believing a lot of what is depicted here as approved foster homes. I was also very dissappointed in the ending."
5,Fantastic book,"I believe ""White Oleander"" is the best book i have read in my young lifetime. Janet Fitch has a nack for making the most ordinary days in time seem extraordinarily beautiful. This book, poignant and mature, is a must-read."
5,In love,"One phrase to describe the way you feel about this bookduring the first 300 pages ""totally in love"" the last 150 pages is down hill. It's not bad but it is as gripping as the beginning. But all around reccomend this book to anyone one desprate to fall in love with a book."
2,not my kind of book,I thought the writing was a bit amateur and the plot a little too soap opera dramatic.
5,Awesome,"I read the book after a friend had me watch the movie, and while the movie was sooo well done it lacks so many important events in the book. Both of which though are incredibly well done and deserving of praise.In closing, if you liked the movie you will love the book!"
5,BOOGIEMONSTERS....ILLLLL,"yo man, let me tell you, back in 1994 there were a lot of underground groups comin out of ny. bms' stood out with an album with hypnotic prophetical sounds. now when i hear their cd i realize that this album is probably the most artistic hip hop album ever made. the way the songs flow together and the shift of emotions the songs deliver is on another level. i seriously think that these guys were ahead of their time, and still are. These beats have instruments used in them that a lot of people never used in hip hop, but they work perfectly hand in hand with their style. Not to mention, these guys are trying to save peoples souls with their futuristics flows of revelations. This is some of the most powerful hip hop ever made!"
3,3 AND A HALF STARS...NOT THREE.,"This Cd is between 3 and 4 stars...so I'll give it three and a half. Maybe a tiny speck more. This is my first Craft CD. It wasn't horrible, but I'm not jumping up and down. The instrumentals were pretty good. They'd be even better though if the same guitar riff didnt seem to appear in almost every song- makes it sort of monotonous. The vocals were fair also. Not the best I've ever heard for a Black Metal band, but they flowed with the music pretty well. This band almost reminds me of Black Dawn except with better guitar work. I'd say this CD is worth checking out...only if you're not too particular and/or technical and really love black metal. For anyone else, it might not sound too great."
1,Didn't even get a cover.,"I was looking forward to this one. But when it arrived, it didn't even have a proper cover, let alone booklet or track listings. Just put in a 2 cent piece of black plastic for shipping."
5,Jedi Starfighter,"This is a wonderful toy. It it fun to play with, and the landing gear really works!"
5,The Jedi's most powerful ship,"This lego creation is the my personal favorite next to the Republic Gunship. It's small, light, and very unstable, but it is fast enough to chase Jengo fett. It comes with Obi-wan Kenobi and the R4 droid's head.Its curved wing structure makes it immpossible to play with it without breaking it, but that's the only thing that is unstable about it. After you finished building it, you should press your fingers around the loose lego pieces to tighten them up,it will make it more stable. Now I am trying to save up for Slave 1."
5,Give me better landing gear!!!,"This set is cool but the landing gear could be a little more durable. I find that when I try to put Obi in, the landin gear collapse into their folded forms. other than that, this set is cool!!!"
4,episode 2 starfighter,"I just bought this a few days ago, let me tell you that the wings should be added some extra legos too keep them from falling off. I think it is educational because it relates to obi-wan and the movie. As we all know star wars sets are really fun.If anybody could tell me when they released the millenium falcon i would realllllyyyyy appreciate it i want to buy one"
3,A descent review by Balboa,"This Jedi Star Fighter is a neat little thing for lego fans, but i wished it had more play value to it. The landing gear is'nt the best, but it holds the thing up. Obi wan is neat, but you nead some one else to make this set fun, like Jango and his ship. It is easy to build, and fun, but the wings fall off a little too easily. and if anyone wants to know some Starwars facts: R4 is BUILT IN!!! That is why it doesn't have a body. And this Delta 7 Aether Sprite is the predacesor to the mile long Star Destroyers. It is fun, but is better to have the Jango Fett Slave 1 too."
1,Not Sticky Enough,"I've only used this tape twice since I've purchased it, and I don't think you should be paying this much for a clothing tape. It isn't sticky enough, and I don't know, maybe it's my skin - I have oily skin - but the stickiness wears off after lunch. I won't be repurchasing and will find something better to replace this product ASAP."
5,worked great,"The tape worked awesomely. i would just suggest applying it while sitting down. I didn't, which caused the tape to pull every time i sat down."
5,He loves his lamp,Lamp works great. When one of the glasses didnt arrive they were very quick to fix the problem
2,Not a quality product,"I just bought these earrings and noticed as soon as I opened them that the backs did not fit closely. And I was right within a week I have already lost one of the earrings, and the gold posts are VERY thin and one of mine was already bent when I received the earrings. Overall a waste of money."
4,Its O.K.,"Hey, its only a cloth book with plastic sleeves in it. What can I say...it beats having piles of CD's in a shoebox!"
4,Lots of space and a good price.,"This is a pretty good deal for a 224 CD Wallet. I was considering the Case Logic Wallet but it is about [price]more than the Fellowes. The construction of the Fellowes is good and similar to my other Case Logic Wallets, the carrying handle is especially usueful as it can get pretty heavy when full. My only gripe is the design of the plastic covering for each CD slot. It is basically an oval shaped hole in the plastic placed near the hole of the CD, while you can grasp the CD hole and top of the edge of the CD to start to remove the CD, you will reach the end of oval so you'll have to pinch the top of the CD to remove it from the wallet. For this case you can't grab the hole of the CD and the edge and remove the CD in one motion. Nevertheless this can easily be fixed by cutting the plastic to open up the hole. Doing it that 224 times was major pain but worth it as it is alot easier to remove CDs now."
3,Holds a lot but....,"Sure its a cd folder but they could have least of put the pages on 3-5 rings (instead of stitching the pages in) so at least that way the pages would not be lower than the outer zippers when it is opened up. You shouldnt have to worry about scratching your cds up on the zipper when you try to slide them back in. Get a Case Logic cd folder instead they use ring binders for better organization of the pages. This product is slightly less than average, even though it is only a cd folder they could have made it better for the cost."
4,"Economical, Excellent Storage, but Would not Open Completely","I really like this product, I just wished that the album would open completely. I need three hands to use it - two to keep it open and one to insert the cd."
4,Holds a lot,"Nothing special. Just holds a lot. Doesn't seem very substantial, so I wouldn't carry it around much, but it's fine for storage, which was all I needed"
4,Adequate for the price,"I bought two of these, and they work well for the price paid.I would have added a label holder and a capability to add a few more pages.The disk slots are not the newer deluxe versions, but are adequate."
1,Avoid this software,"I ordered the CD and tried installing this software on two different machines running Windows 2000. In both cases, the install process crashed and gave an undecipherable error message . I contacted the company and was e-mailed instructions on how to download the product. I downloaded it and was able to install it, but it crashes constantly. In sum, I would avoid this product."
3,"Classic, but outdated Sesame Street","Good, but outdated Sesame Street video on Chanukah. We celebrate both chanukah and christams in our house. There aren't too many videos out there about chanukah to compete with all the christmas movies. The movie entertained my 3.5 and 5.5 girls, but they aren't begging to watch it over and over. A more modern version is needed."
2,BORING,"THIS MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR AN OLDER CHILD THAN MY TODDLER, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS ON THE BORING SIDE."
2,"No more ""Tully Entertainment"" watermarks please.","Great documentary on the only U.S. Navy combat helicopter squadron in Vietnam. Superb footage, interesting interviews & snappy music, what more could you ask for? How about no ""TULLY ENTERTAINMENT"" watermark, emblazoned on the lower right side of the screen, throughout the entire program. The size of this ""banner"" is large enough to distract the viewer. TULLY, how about taking a look at some of the NBC, BBC or National Geographic documentaries to see how it should be done."
4,Want a Straight up overview of Proxy Server 2.0 This is it.,"I read this book from cover to cover once and found this to be a straight up overview of Proxy Server 2.0 in order to pass Exam 70-088. This is my last exam needed to receive my MCSE in WINNT 4.0. The only fault I found in this book is with the pre-print editor review, there are numerous spelling and grammar errors through out the book. This made for the reader to guess what point in a section the author was trying to get across. After going through the book a 2nd time and fixing these errors, the confusion was eliminated. This is the book to read to pass Exam 70-088."
2,Not as good as I was expecting,"From the overall glowing reviews I've read on this book, I expected to read and comprehend the subject fairly quickly but so far when I finish each chapter and take the review questions I've felt like I must have missed something. Having taken and passed the 4 core MCSE tests using the Sybex books I expected to have a similar experience with this book based on the reviews. With the Sybex books I felt pretty comfortable at the end of each chapter and answered most of the review questions correctly. Not so with this book, very dry, choppy delivery and the questions seem to not relate to what was covered in the chapter. I wish I had stuck with the Sybex books, I'm definately using them for Exchange 5.5!"
3,wasn't that impressed,"to be honest i didn't find this book that impressive. I found the topic on the webproxy/winproxy and socks proxy services confusing. i read that section 3 times and still didn't understand the concepts. i read the sybex study notes proxy book and found that a much better read. i didn't like the study break sections in this book either. the author does not verify the answers which makes them pointless if you are reading the book when not nearby a proxy server. The cd that comes with it is a disapoinment too, just an abridged cbt training course. what we should have had was a test question program. on the plus point it does have some good sections that make it a valuable reference such as run-time error codes."
3,Important reading for IT professional(wanna bees),"I recently read this boook in preparation for the 70-88 test. It covers the main points and does a good job at explaining performance monitor, network monitor.The troubleshooting section is a great guide for getting back to or learning the basics of troubleshooting.The only things that I did not like was it a little vauge on domain filters and the LAT.Felt it could have been better also if it had a more indepth look at reverse proxy and hosting.I didnt really get a warm and fuzzy on the idea of chains VS arrays either. But im a second year student so I needed more information than was provided. But this is a very good book if it is used in conjunction with other resources."
3,Wish there were better!,"I will admit the book is fairly complete when it comes to the full scope of MS Proxy knowledge needed to pass the MCSE test. And will make a decent reference guide for Proxy administration. But be warned! This book is NOT for people without significant mastery of TCP/IP and NT Server! The information is presented in one of the most dry & choppy manners of any MCSE book I've read, to date. Not a very well organized presentation, it took a read & re-read to really feel I comprehended the information. Don't let it's diminuitive size (compared to most MCSE books) fool you this is a slow & tough read. Could of, & should of been much better. GOOD LUCK!"
1,"I was duped, too.",This album was highly praised by so many magazines that I had to buy it to check it out. I am so disappointed. I don't understand what Spin and CMJ were thinking. This album is just plain boring. It's completely unoriginal. I tried very hard to see what all the hype was about. After forcing myself to listen to it several times it still delivers nothing redeeming.
1,"Well, I'll never read Vice magazine again.","Wow - a very poor album. I'll never read Vice Magazine again for promoting this kind of rubbish. This band is almost exclusively concerned with their marketing and promotion - you really couldn't be less hip if you listen to this group. The sad, naive college-age attempts at intelligence and art are not pulled off by this group of youngsters. The problem is, the don't write good songs - the melodies are unoriginal, as well as the sound - the seem like a cover band or something - just trying to get attention and admiration for their ""uniqueness"" by clever con jobs on the media and public - this band is obviously headed nowhere and they probably should be a littled embarassed about this music - I'd be."
4,Two great characters in one small set,"The reason I couldnt resist this set was because of Yoda....what Star Wars (and Lego) fan could go without this in your collection? Count Doku will also likely be a great and important character to the series and worth collecting. The speeder bike thing he rides is pretty cool looking and has some nice detail, including a holder for his unique curved lightsaber.The detail on the Doku figure is nice and Yoda is build using the same legs as seen in the Ewok set.The only thing I dont understand is the laser looking thing. It has all these interesting pivots and rotating pieces to it, but I'm really unsure what its supposed to be. Perhaps it'll make sense once I see the movie. (which will come out in 3 weeks from when I wrote this review).Because of the price and relative small size of the set (all the pieces are in details), this product was worth getting."
4,Jedi Duel,"This is a cool set. I really like Count Dooku's Speederbike. It has cool fins and a clip to put a lightsaber. Count Dooku's lightsaber has a curved hilt like in the movie. If you want a cool Star Wars kit, you will like this!"
4,this is a great set!!!,"this is an awesom set! it includes yoda, who is not featured in any other sets. count dooku is also really cool with the curved lightsaber. the speeder is good and this set could go well with the geonosian fighter because in the movie dooku is escorted on his speeder by two geonosian fighters.this is a durable set except for the tower thing ( which is actually suppposed to be the tower count dooku knoks over with the force and trys to crush anakin and obi-wan under. the tower can swivel and certain parts come of so you can reenact yoda using the force). this set would have been more fun if they had included anakin and obi-wan kenobi. overall this is a great star wars set and is worth getting because #1 it is the only lego set ever to include yoda #2 it is so awesome! have fun!"
5,"Finally, Yoda in LEGO form!!!","The moment you've all been waiting for has finally arrived. Yes, Yoda is finally available in LEGO form. Personally that's the only reason I wanted to buy this set. It was very nice of LEGO not to have Yoda only available in some hundred dollar set and the Count is a nice bonus. As far as the other building pieces, I was rather unimpressed. LEGO is becoming increasingly dependant on new shapes and less pieces included in their sets. Despite this fact LEGO remains one of the top toys to buy your children to develop their minds and imaginations. Needless to say this is a ""must-have"" for all you Star Wars fans."
5,Yoda-man,This is soooooo cool - I cant believe I finally got this with money from my Grandma in Illinois - I like to carry these little guys around in my pants pocket as much as possible - you never know when you might need that lighted light saber that YODAMAN carries around - Dooko has finally met his match - get this one all you Star Wars freaks (like me) - even better now that it is on sale
3,The net second time around,"This moves, as in many sequals, did not seem to have the excitement and charm of the original version. It was ok in my opinion but not exciting."
2,The Net 2.0ut of 5 stars,"I agree with everything the reviewer before me said. The movie started out slow and a bit amateurish. It was a little bit predictable (except for maybe one part... I won't spoil it for you). Nikki Deloach (from the New Mickey Mouse Club and the former music group Innosense) did an ok job with acting. I guess all in all the movie was just kind of so-so and bland where it should have been more exciting and suspenseful. Putting the Sandra Bullock version of ""The Net"" in a different setting (Istanbul) doesn't really change the movie all that much. Still the same basic plot: people steal someone's identity that doesn't have any family or friends to vouch for who she is. You didn't feel anything for any of the characters in the movie. They were very 2 dimensional and well, boring. Nice try, but pretty much a failure as far as GOOD movies go."
1,Run away from The Net 2.0 and never look back,"In name sequel to the not so hot 1995 Sandra Bullock movie THE NET. Why make it? I dont know and I dont care. Nikki Deloach (Windfall, Traveller) stars as Hope Cassidey, a woman on the run from people who want her because her identy is leaked to a murder and a robbery and what not. She tries to correct her self and noone seems to believe she is telling the truth. They all think she is this Kelly Roos woman. Well, all I can say this is that The Net 2.0 is totally boring and complete waste. Deloach is simple rendered dull here as she screams and runs and yells....to put it to simple terms, her acting sucks and what a waste of Neil Hopkins (TV's LOST, Aimee Price) who always does good work but here he doesnt have anything to do. Also starring Keegan Connor Tracy (White Noise, Jake 2.0), Demet Akbag (Davaci, Magic Carpet Ride), Sebnem Domnez (Where's Firuze>, Runaway Mummy) and Guven Kirac (Lovelorn, Innocence). Watch HACKERS, that is a better movie."
3,Very Complicated..,Well... From the beginning its understandable but then it gets a little complicated but not boring!!!So if u wanna watch it just watch it and then u decide.
3,From bad to good,OOOOH we've all seen this film in many guises before but the tension and frustration associated with these types of films remain.Is it a good film...not sure.CAN YOU watch it and feel satisfied...yea I believe so.
2,Tilt,"As little vigniettes this is an interesting book, but the ""connections"" are tenuous at best. In pinball the ball makes contact and changes direction, many of the ideas don't make direct contact - much is coincidence."
3,Very inventive style but TMI,"This is an ingenious ways of writing a book but it borders more on a way of storing information. It is not the type of book that you read from cover to cover although you could that if you wanted to. It is essentially cross-referenced with itself. What is does is talk about a particular advancement or invention, providing page numbers in the margins for other advancements or inventions that that one enabled. You can bounce all through the book this way - hence the name of the book. It is very interesting but there is a certain amount of information overload. I kept wondering 'How does he know all of this stuff?'."
2,Connections getting tired,"Burke's ""Connections"" is an excellent reference source. It aroused a passion within the reader to progress further with this fascinating subject, of how significant events were connected, and how technology devolped from them.The Pinball Effect is a good example of an author, that like Clive Custler, should have stopped writing while they were ahead.A very boring read"
2,A theory in search of some facts,"I'm a fan of this guy, but I'm afraid this book has kicked around my bedside reading pile for too long and will be consigned to the 'too frustrating' pile. The idea is good, but it's just so badly executed. The narrative style falls into the rambling conversation area. If you enjoy listening to conversations on late night talk back radio, then maybe this is the book for you. If you are looking for a memorable discourse, look elsewhere. The idea is good, but better executed in other books - for example 'The hinge factor'."
3,Connection does not equal causation!,"It's been some time since I read this book, but I was recently reminded of it. I like Burke's pinwheeling (or pinballing, rather) style, jumping from topic to topic and making what are, indeed, often very interesting connections.The reason I rate this book so low, however, is that often Burke sums up a series of connections by implying -- or sometimes directly stating -- that the first event in the chain caused, by means of the intermediate steps, the last. This is often not at all the case; the connections between steps may have had no causal relationship, but simply meant that a person was working in the same city, or some other such interesting but not causally relevant connection.So in short, the chains of connections themselves make for fun reading, but don't trust the summaries. ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" to quote an old statistics maxim; in the case of The Pinball Effect, connection doesn't always equal causation, either."
5,just in time for the festive season,"Although this Libera DVD is not really ""Christmas"" it arrived at our house in tropical Bandung Java Indonesia just in time for the festive season. There are not so many ""quality european"" choir DVD's available..even less containing popular Christmas songs....and there should be. Libera's performance was recorded over 3 nights at the very old historic St Pieter's Church in Leiden the Netherlands to an appreciative and enthusiastic live audience. The sound and picture quality is superb and the presentation is flawless. If Libera produce any more DVD's this household will certainly order them from Amazon....So for 2009...let's hope that more young choir music will be available on DVD....how about DVD's containing concerts from the Tolzer Sangerknaben, Vienna Boy's Choir and the Mozart Sangerknaben? and less of the smaltzy US fireside novelty christmas DVD's.Stephen Bandung Java Indonesia"
3,More of the same but different,"If you just want to hear the music, a CD will do just as well. This performance is a little too static for my taste and the programme rather too even paced.A study of the faces reveals a multitude of ways to achieve a beautiful sound.The setting is a fine one, but we see very little of it. The interviews with the boys reveal some delightful touches. I think more could have been done - with very little extra effort - to enhance the performance to match the quality of the singing."
5,Libera continue the legacy of great music,"An impressive live performance. A ""must have DVD"" for all Libera fans.Although Libera, as with all boy choirs, have to continually bring in new tallent to replace those who have grown an inch or two, the training by Robert Prizeman shines through with the new stars now singing. This DVD includes hits of the past and present, and has some really fun interviews. The enjoyment and commitment of the boys is clearly displayed."
4,Libera new dawn,This disc maintains Libera's high musical standard with old favorites from the English choral tadition presented through Robert Prizeman's beautiful harmonies.
5,Angel Voices,"What can be better than to listen to a beautiful boys choir. We had seen them several times on TV and in the end I purchased the DVD. They are young men picked from all walks of life in the London suburbs who join the choir and have their voices trained to perfection. The travel all over the world giving concerts and even when they can no longer sing as a choir member, apparently seem to stay with the group in other capacities. As choristors, they are tops in my opinion."
2,Still Falls Short,"If what you want is a Windows-like experience from Linux, then this distribution will only get you part of the way there.Good (Specific to Xandros):-Easy installation-Desktop is much like Windows, and offers some nice extras-Comes with some applications which install with a button-pushBad (Specific to Xandros):-Poor audio hardware support-Extremely poor technical support from XandrosGood (Shared by all Linuxes):-Freedom from MicroSoft and Apple-Stable operating systemBad (Shared by all Linuxes):-Application installation is still needlessly complicatedXandros may meet your needs if you're already a Linux-type who wants to tinker with the innards of the system, but I would suggest trying something else if you need a Windows replacement for average users."
1,poor and outclassed,"This thing was peculiar 10 years ago when it first appeared, and today it is simply not even worth considerations. Get something nice like new Ubuntu, Fedora, Centos etc. This thing is another failed attempt to create ""proprietary"" Linux distro. Who needs poor proprietary distro when Ubuntu, Fedora, madriva, OpenSuSE are available! With mainstream Linuxes you get great support, plenty of compatibility, tuned software etc. Free support forums on Ubuntu or Fedora answer questions almost immediately and there are many people who are ready to help."
2,good so far!,"I don't think this did anything actually. I still have a scar. But, this is my review from before....The product was recommended to me by my plastic surgeon. I had a scar on my face that I am trying to revise. So, needless to say I am being very careful. I am applying as it has said (twice per day). The scar is healing nicely so far (about 1 month), but it is difficult to say whether it would have been worse without it. The surgery was 6 weeks ago, so it is still a young scar. The ridges that formed quickly are just now going down and the redness is lessening each day.In contrast I have been using it on a scar I have had for 10+ years and the difference is slim to none, but I will keep using it there. Fortunately one tube goes a very long way."
2,Cosmetic surgery,My cosmetic surgeon gave me a sample of Scarfade and then I bought the full size. I've used it for about three weeks on a 1 inch scar under my chin but haven't noticed much improvement.
5,A great historic book to read.,"I found this book to be very entertaining. The book includes a lot of pictures and interesting short facts which most people didn't know about. I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious to know more about history, but at the same time doesn't want to be bored with too much details and boring facts."
1,"Glossy, Glib, but Unballanced","This book offers a pop history of the Cold War intended for a wide audience. Its main aim seems to be to persuade that both sides were morally equivilent - that the Cold War was caused by misunderstandings and politics rather than a clash of civilization vs. barbarism. No one would, or should, treat the conflict against Facism and National Socialism (Nazism) in this fashion; monsterous crimes should be recognized for what they are. Communism was equally wicked, not just another point of view.For a more accurate portrayal of what was at stake in the Cold War I recomend ""The Black Book of Communism"" and ""Architects of Victory."" If any sources should be used to educate children, it is these books (especially ""The Black Book of Communism,"" which is thouroughly reasurced by scholars in the various fields that are covered), and not this Turner effort to re-write realities underlying the Cold War."
4,Cold War,This is a brilliant look at the cold war period and the events that lead up to it. It is comprehensive enough without becoming too dry to plough through and I found it engaging throughout. The illustrations are well produced and the chapters are full of detail. Well recommended if you are interested in learning more about this period of history.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
2,"Apparently, the victors DON'T write history.","This book, of course, is a companion to the 24-part series on CNN. While it is comprehensive, well-photographed, and well-edited, Ted Turner's Team just can't help taking the revisionist's view that the Cold War was fought by morally equivalent superpowers. The US certainly didn't wear a white hat during the Cold War, but putting us on the same moral level as a reactive, authoritarian regime that crushed all dissent, inside and outside the country, is pure folly. A good example is the coverage of Stalin's Gulag and the McCarthy era. McCarthyism was truly a dark spell in US history which led to careers and reputations being ruined. However, I don't remember millions of suspected subversives/dissidents being worked/starved to death in Alaska. Better dead than Ted!!!"
3,Foot relief,"For the pricre it is an okay product - very noisy and water cools quicker than I would like, but overall okay. I have lots of problems with my feet and was hoping a foot spa would help relieve some of the issues - haven't used this enough yet to know if it will help. Would give it a 50% so far - am hoping for my personal like of the product to improve."
2,Not the best quality,I bought this for my wife on her birthday and she was very happy when she opened it. The order arrived right on time with no delays. The quality of the product is not quite worth the price though. If you plan to use some sort of salts with this DON'T it will cause the bubbles to stop working. It is also very noisy and actually ran too hot. We had to run it to get it hot then let it sit for a few minutes with it unplugged before it reached a temperature where it wouldn't burn her. Overall I would go with another product.
5,So Cool~,A friend showed me this program on his computer and I bought 2 as Christmas gifts. For anyone who has an interest in the night sky and learning more about what it is we're looking at! Great product!
3,major underwired,"I have bought three bras hoping to find my prefect match. I am a 40 D . This is the only wired one I bought, and it is major wired. The fit is fair the 3 peice cup is a good fit, the straps seem to be staying in place but the wires (4 total) 2 in the cups and two more in the sides just poke, poke, poke. Not a comfortable fit, BUT a nice shape."
2,Not for me.....,"Not for me.....Lilyette Women's Maximum Support Bra, Fawn.....Unattractive and shaped funny nice color but uncomfortable.....I just threw them out....not worth returning!~"
3,Runs big & not all that supportive,"I'm a bit surprised by the glowing reviews of this bra. It's comfortable, but it isn't all that supportive. also, it runs big, in my opinion. The cups pucker right in the middle area of the breast, and I bought these thinking they would be tight because I had been wearing a D cup."
5,Best bra construction,"This is the best bra I have purchased in over 40 yrs of wearing one, but it has since been discontinued. Why, I will never know. The support is excellent (44D) and the design is comfortable and uplifting for those with large breasts. Thank goodness for Amazon as I was sooo disappointed this model was discontinued. Buy it while you can!!I bought two and as long as available, I will buy more."
1,Very Uncomfortable,"I wear either a 36DD or a 34DDD and have never had bras that were this uncomfortable to wear. I ordered the 36DD which fit fine with a little room to spare width wise. However, after wearing this an hour I had to take it off. The wires in the center went so high that it separated my breasts and the wires on the sides pushed my breasts toward the center in a minimizer fashion. Similarly, I found the shoulders to be uncomfortable as it was pulling my breasts up at the same time as everything else was pushing them in. I usually wear bras that are full coverage and wire. They have all been very comfortable and I am not sure what my problem was with this bra. However, I never wear minimizer bras or bras that have wires this high around the breasts. I don't think I can ever wear it as it truly was extrememly uncomfortable. However, everyone else seems to have had a great experience with this bra. I guess I am just the minority."
5,Give me more!!! black and beige please!,"I love this bra. It is superior! I would wear this all day everyday if I could get it in beige/nude and black. The padded lycra straps are sooooo comfortable. This is the only bra, and an underwire bra at that, that I don't mind wearing at all. It is like the bra is not there at all. I take a large size, 44DDD and it is the BEST bra by far of all that I have and many of those cost more than this one. The price is quite right on this to suit the quality. Just please get me more colors!!! I will then order more!!!"
3,MAIDENFORM BRA,"Please inform Maidenform that they have cheapened their once fine support bra.When one gets used to a fine quality, support bra, it is hard to believe thata reputable company would use such poor quality materials.The elastic does not support as it used to at the shoulder and the material in the side panels is now a softer material that rolls, not like it was originally, a stiffer spandex material that gave great support. The new form of thisbra is mis-represented now, surely is not the support bra it used to be advertized to be and was!Alice Mckeever"
2,Disappointed customer,"I absolutely love Lilyette bras. I own several of this particular style. But this time when I ordered 2 new ones, same style, same size it wasn't even close to fitting. A bra is an item that you just can't return once it's been tried on and worn. I thought I could get used to it. Readjusting everything, but no good. What has happened? Why do they not fit? Amazon you are a great company to order items from, but this time I was disappointed. But I will remain a loyal customer."
1,ample cup size and seam create pucker line on shirts,"I returned this bra due to fit. I am a DD cup, and if anything cup sizes usually run a little small. In this model, it was more than I needed and left puckered material right at the seam. When I put a shirt on to see how it fit under a shirt, there was an extremely noticeable pucker line on my shirt. I was wearing a pretty heavy sweatshirt, so I came to the conclusion that aside from wearing a blazer, everyone would always be able to see the seems on my bra. So I returned it."
5,Excelent kit,Good cockpit detail. good quality surfaces and panel lines.Think it's a hassegawa repack.Compared to it's price really good choice.
4,Eye opening,"I am interviewing for a post-graduate job and I asked a successful woman in my field for some negotiating advice. She recommended this book. Ironically, I always considered myself a good negotiator. Yet, as I read this book, it mirrored so many situations where I made tactical negotiation mistakes with regards to my own personal gain. A must read for women, in any stage of their career."
4,Much-needed research,"An invaluable reference took, the authors have delivered much-needed research to support their arguments. Rather than offer the usual gender-based diatribe, they detail important findings from the best sources and offer valid, pointed arguments while asking challenging questions. Readers will be rewarded with insights into the condition of gender relations in modern work environments as well as benefiting from the authors' well-supported views."
4,Magic and more magic,"This is a wholesome cute tale of a young man named Cavan who comes of age in an ancient world full of adventure, fairies and magic. Cavan's grandmother, Muire is a much respected Druid. Muire instructs Cavan on many secrets before the boy sets off to begin his study at a Druid compound in the capital city of Cliath.The protective goddess of their island Maeve intervenes and greatly assists in the boy's preparation. Her magic conjures visions of the past and future to be viewed by Cavan to permit him to live the history of family and nation.The authors have succeeded in bringing me back to early Celtic times of heroes and villains. Cavan and Muire's family are characters so real and their lives so magical that I was sad to reach the book's end. On entertainment and informative Celtic Lure, I rate the book 9 out of 10 in satisfaction. - Missy Madra."
3,"Borrow it from the library, not worth buying!","In the midst of my desperate search for ideas during my wedding planning, I grabbed a copy of this book at the local library. The pictures were stunning and the ideas looked great... But the ideas are only possible for people with fat bank accounts. His idea of ""creative"" and ""chic"" is BIG BIG and BIGGER flower arrangements topping at thousands of dollars each, probably. It's a nice eye candy to flip through... you may learn a few things and it may spark a few ideas of your own, but not worth the price tag. Buy it used or borrow it from the library. I found that the handful of Bride magazines I obtained had more creative ideas, and I could tear the pages out of those and copy them for vendors... you wouldn't want to bend a page in this pricey book."
2,Not a good value,"The color separation in this book was terrible. Also the pictures were a big disappointment, given the price. I also thought the designs were too frilly and overdone. Definitely not a good pick for a person looking for a more modern feel for her wedding. You're better off with any of Maria McBride's books."
5,Just a Question,"I kept it five stars so I wouldn't effect the average. I was just wondering if this book discusses weddings for different cultures and/or ethnic backgrounds i.e. Jumping the Broom, Latino receptions, etc. Or is this book generalized in that Cowrie will say things like 'use what's best for you and here're some ideas to get you started'?"
5,Stunning visuals - a feast for the eyes,"I've purchased several wedding books and magazines, but none comes close to this one in terms of sheer beauty. While most of Cowie's weddings are high budget mega-affairs, many of his ideas and presentations can be adapted to fit any budget. This book is current, sophisticated, and full of interesting ideas rather than pedantic advice, motherly reminders and trite ""do's and don'ts"". I've looked at it again and again as I plan my celebration."
2,This book is too lavish for my taste.,"I found this book to have some beautiful ideas, but the overall effect was much too extravagant. I can only think of maybe five pages that made me pause to admire them some more. I believe that when creating a romantic atmosphere, there is a point when you leave well enough alone. I prefer the styles in Victoria's Romantic Weddings and Mcbride-Mellinger's The Perfect Wedding. Then again, I'd much rather have the Cotswold cottage over the lavish, sprawling mansion."
5,Kayline Flat Irons & Blow Dryer Holder,The product is good and mounted on the wall easily. I would have preferred that one of the holders be a bit larger to accommodate the blow dryer with a large barrel more easily. The vendor was prompt and I would do business again.
4,A must have for all toddler moms,This curling iron holder certainly does it's job of keeping hot styling wands and flat irons off of counter out of reach of little hands.... or my clumsy hands for that matter. Large enough for even the biggest curling irons; I keep my blow dryer in the larger slot. Can't believe I went all these years without one. Very convenient and the added outlets this one offers makes it a great choice. Have had this for 2 years now and am very happy with the purchase.
4,pleased with my curlers,I was very pleased with the curlers I bought needing some smaller ones nowI will buy from amazon again.
4,Caruso Hair System,"This, I believe, is the best hair system around. Gives shine and fluff to my extremely straight hair."
2,Misleading Subtitle,"The subtitle ""A Practical Guide"" is misleading, this book covers very little practical information for anyone interested in gaining detailed knowledge of educational travel programs. A mix of social science theory and anecdotal episodes, a more appropriate subtitle might have been ""Some Social and Psychological Aspects of Educational Travel from a Contemporary Academic Perspective."""
4,Paladin 1576 Data/Link ID,The produce was just as advertised. It works very well in my line of Telephone and Data work. It saves me time having to check the wiring after I have completed putting on the ends of the cables.
4,"a good read but very violent, even for Tanith lee","I have been a big fan of Tanith Lee starting all the way back with The Silver Metal Lover when I was in high school. I am 36 now, and recently really went crazy over the Paradys series. I guess my all time favorite is A Heroine of the World. I love all her books in all the different genres in which she writes. I found Vivia riveting (of course) and also relentlessly, horrifically violent and sadistic. It almost seems like Ms. Lee was seeing how far in this direction she could go. I have not read a lot of her horror books, but I think this would rank amongst the more extreme. (for instance, there are a lot of crucifixions and impalings described in loving detail) Anyway, just thought I would write down my opinion for other die-hard fans out there-- this one made even ME cringe."
2,A Dissapointment,"I don't mean to be hard on Tanith Lee, but this book just wasn't all that enjoyable for me. The book ""Vivia"" did not seem to have that carefully crafted, beautiful text of Lee's previous work. In fact, it seemed to me that she wrote the book without enough thought in the content of the book. ""Black Unicorn"" took my breath away, both in the plot and character developement as well as the climactic ending. But ""Vivia"" seemed to lack that magic. The characters reluctantly move from chapter to chapter, containing no great dimension or interest. On top of that, this book desperately needs an editor. In short, if you want a good Tanith Lee book in the spirit of ""Black Unicorn"" and the ""Claidi Journals,"" this is not the one to get."
5,A great machine!,I highly recommend this machine. Not only is the picture and sound great but you can play DVDs from any region. It also has a built in PAL to NTSC converter so that you can play any DVD in the world. Amazon UK has a lot of great titles that are not availble in the U.S. and will not play on a standard region 1 DVD player.
2,Disappointed it did not work,"I loved the features of this player, but the many defects greatly disappointed me. I got the 9000N with progresive scan in anticipation of a future TV upgrade. The 9000N played my one brand new DVD perfectly but had problems with all others: Color picture would switch to b/w briefly, skip or freeze during playback of discs with which my mom's Sony 360 had no problems. Simple playback should not be an issue! When the picture stutters, the machine does not respond to remote control & I have to turn the unit off on its main body. Also, the disc tray cover does not consitently flip close. Other owners have experienced many of these same problems.I have heard that Daewoo's 5700 is made in Korea by a different manufacturer (TYT) & is perhaps more reliable. However, it doesn't have the same features as 9000N (lacks Progressive Scan, VGA out, optical out). Would be great if it did."
1,Dead on arrival,"The unit I received was dead on arrival. At first all I could get was a power available light, which comes on when you flip the rocker switch on the back. None of the buttons would work. I turned the unit off and let it sit for 30 minutes, then turned it back on. This time I was able to eject the tray and load a disc. Unfortunately, the machine cycled repeatedly between different speeds without reading the disc. I tried this with several discs but only succeeded in locking up the player and having to power it down, wait 30 minutes, and power it back up (immediate power up resulted in no functionality at all) to retrieve my discs. I've worked with the machine for 24 hours and have seen several failure modes, including one where the television screen flickered and rolled wildly. No amount of coaxing or rebooting had led to a successful load of any kind of disc....."
1,Poor owners manual prevents DVD system set-up,"The device itself may work fine - I just don't know. The only connection cables that came with the unit were the RCA jacks for left/right audio and video. The problem is I was trying to install it through a system with an RCA 31"" TV, an Echostar Sat. dish receiver and a Sony VCR. There was no combination of connetions that permitted me to get sound or video to examine. Of course, it was a christmas present to my family, we rented several DVDs and couldn't watch any of them.Well I guess the jokes on me - HO HO HO HO!"
3,VGA output users... warning.,"This is one of very few players that has VGA output sold in U.S. For some reason, VGA output looks darker than s-video (perhaps macrovision on?) I couldn't watch in VGA output mode that I had to switch back to s-video(which defeated whole purpose of getting this player in the first place). Even with s-video, machine black out on picture every 30 minutes or so. However, it's got lot of features that outside U.S users might want. supports both PAL and NTSC and so forth"
1,Broken Down,"This player seemed like a fine player for the first 8 months. Then it started hesitating to play disks and eventually quit altogther. I opened the case to discover that it was not spinning the disk. I hoped it was just a motor but the problem seems to originate from the circuit board. If you've already bought this player then hopefully it serves you well. If not then consider paying a little extra for a more reliable brand such as JVC, or SHARP which are the two most reliable names in electronics."
1,failed after 10 months and poor warranty and support,"I bought this after hearing the wonderfulreview about this unit. It failed after10 months. When I called Deawoo technical support,she asked me to power-off the unit and turn -ONafter 1/2 hour. I did that, but no luck.However, after couple of days, it started to work,but it failed again. I am an electronics engineer, so to me,it appears that they do not have a reliable product.In addition, they do not have a good customer/technical support.They took my name and phone no. and promised me to callme back and I have not heard from them. It was twomonths ago, now my warranty for parts is also going to expire."
1,Watch out for defective unit!,"Just received my yesterday after a week of waiting.I was looking forward to MP3, RGB out, prograssive scan in long run. Have heard all the negative comments such as progressive scan only component out, some blue lines during some dvd play with some units, limited remote range...At current price of... , it is one of the most feature packed one out in the market.I have played with DVG-5700 and I was satisfied with it.But the one (DVG-9000N) I received turned out to be defective. When I power it on, it absolutely does nothing. No image, no sound. The CD tray won't open, won't repond to remote. It's a dumb box.Only thing that worked is the bright green LED in the middle of the unit. I must say, I was extremely disappointed. And I gladly returned it this morning.This experience convences that no matter how many features it provides, if it can not be readily reliable and provide some solid basic performance, it's useless."
1,Poor Quality,"This DVD player does all it says it can do, plays on NTSC and PAL TVs and plays DVDs from all regions, but it has only one problem, it has alot of quality problems.I used the machine 3 times and now it overheats everytime I try to use it again. I can only watch a movie halfway before I need to turn it off to cool off. I am pretty sure I will have to return this one. In addition, it tends to skip and get stuck on one scene for long periods of time. I think this is the last Daewoo electronic product I buy for a long time. Good Luck."
1,CD tray does not open,"I bought this about a year ago, it worked well though I sparingly used it. I created a SVCD with my PC and tried playing it with this player, it got stuck and never ejected out. It does not respond to any command now. I do NOT recommend this product, the design and testing of this product is shoddy."
3,ups and downs,"purchased this item here at amazon because wasn't available at [local store]. Picture quality is excellent if associated with an HDTV...awesome.exterior looks great with the silver finish and the hook ups on the back fulfill all the ""video genious"" out there.the only down side i found is related to the tray wich often stucks while you try to load the dvd...it's really annoying because loading a disc take sometime few minutes....not to mention the scratches it produces on it during the struggle.i was going to send it back to amazon but time has passed and i decided to live with it.overall an excellent price-quality deal but is really bothering having to deal with the tray knowing that if the daewoo guys would have put few bucks more in quality this problem wouldn't be present."
3,"Good Show, losusy disks","I must say I like this show, and I can see how it has retained it's value: i.e. it costs as much as a new show, but the disks are another matter altogether. I have a brand new (this year) Toshiba laptop with a DVD/BLURAY player. These disks will not play in it at all. Don't get me wrong, I have older disks such as the complete X-Files series that play fine. Even so old, cheaply made disks with old shows like Jack Benny play fine. These do not. Fortunately, they play in my regular DVD player attached to my TV. But it is aggravating not to be able to watch them here on my laptop. Blast!Quoth the Raven..."
5,STREET HAWK THE SERIES,Let's me remeber the past shows of the 80's it was a different time.........You will really enjoy it as if you were watching for the first time
5,For all motorcycle riders and 80s fans,"I remember watching the first episode on tv in the 80s and thinking how cool this bike looked and how advanced it was. Fast forward a few decades, and the bike is still cool, and his suit would actually look good today too. While the writing can be unintentionally hilarious at times, it is still a great series, with great action scenes. I watched em all in 3 days. Rex Smith rules!"
3,"Some good stuff, some not so good stuff","Better than average album from Parton's pop sellout period. Sure there's the disposable title track, but this also has a few tracks that give a nod back to her all too often forgotten roots, most notably a cover of Woody Guthrie's ""Deportees."""
5,Please do not believe the people who give this CD a bad rap,"I have loved this album for nearly twenty years and love Dolly...ALL her different types of music! Those who complain it is a commercial sellout, leaving her country roots behind must have had their ears blocked when ""Hush-A-Bye-Hardtimes, Poorfolks Town, and Dark as a Dungeon"" were playing. How many pop songs begin with: ""Come and listen, ye fellows?"" This is one of Dolly's best albums, showing a range and diversity with country and pop genres that should be applauded. Just because something is a commercial success doesn't mean it is bad. Sometimes the mass public actually picks a winner, and this winner is the complete album from 1980. Previous CD releases were missing two great tracks! There is not a bad cut on this album!"
2,"OK, but stick with Coat for now.","Buddah is to be applauded for finally (if somewhat slowly) reissuing long out of print Dolly Parton albums with a remastered sound. It is especially gratifying that they are giving equal attention to Parton's more creative country period, and not just limiting it to her more pop oriented material. The pattern seems to be reissue one country album and one pop album simultaneously.While this album is better than average for her pop period, it decidedly takes a back seat to the magnificent ""Coat of Many Colors"" album that was reissued along with ""9 to 5."" There really is no comparing the two albums. ""Coat"" is a masterpiece of early 70's country, and a sad reminder of how Nashville no longer cares about its roots. By contrast, this album is pleasant and enjoyable, but hardly in the same league as the bulk of Parton's work before about 1977.2 1/2 stars."
3,Filmed in Hypno-Vista. Now it's time to buy more popcorn,"Fans of Fred Olen Ray's previous cheapskate boob opera, Bikini Airways, will probably like this opus. A down on his luck stage hypnotist and his assistant move away from their psychic parlor to a mansion in Beverly Hills he inherited from his rich aunt. Here he hypnotises as many women as he can to have sex with him. I could add an extra star if the DVD had an option to view the movie without hypno vision where a mood-destroying caption flashes on the screen for a split second during the movie's best parts. Obviously Ray was spoofing William Castle movies that often contained gimmicks like Emergo and Smell-o-Vision."
1,housewives of beverly hills,it came broken the second time i have not watched because it was a gift &they are not bach from honeymoon yet
5,A must for everyone who loves eggs,"Easy-to-follow recipes and useful information in a format that's a pleasure to read. In addition to the egg basics, this book contains several unusual ideas, including over a dozen pasta with egg recipes. Helpful hints such as how to rescue a broken hollandaise sauce, and ""formulas"" for many egg basics make this a book I will refer to often. The recipes include different ethnic variations, including, Indian, Mexican, Italian and Chinese, and cover virtually every meal category. I recommend this book to everyone who loves eggs."
2,Not so good,"I was very disappointed that this cookbook is basically the same dozen recipes with some minor changes in added ingredients. I was hoping for some new ideas on using eggs, and got same old. If you have never cooked with eggs at all it might be useful, but every basic cookbook has omelets, quiche, egg salad, custard, etc. and anyone with imagination can come up with their own flavoring and add in ideas. I bought it along with the ""Totally Eggs Cookbook""for 1/4 the price and with less than 100 pages, and got more new ideas from the latter."
3,Good look at a limited subject.,"I like specific cookbooks; this one certainly fits the bill; I will cook from it. Blah, blah, blah, blah, and blah."
2,poor grammar and syntax makes information seem dubious,"This book is interesting but frustrating. It explains in excruciating detail the admissions process at ONE Ivy League school (Dartmouth), and purports to offer this as a general guide to admissions at the ten or fifteen most selective colleges in the country. It is questionable whether (a) any such analogy is really valid and (b) this is a true glimpse of even Dartmouth's process. Ms Hernandez's biography states that she has an advanced degree in English but you could never tell that from her grammar and syntax. Even my 17-year old son threw down the book in disgust at the sentence structure and the childish prose.I know that many parents view this as the Bible of admissions books, but I think it is more like the Apocrypha or the Book of Mormon--a pretender or a fake, or, at best, an adjunct to more serious and intelligent books such as Bill Paul's Getting In and Bill Mayher's book on the admissions process."
3,A lot not being told here -,"I didn't find this book that revealing or scathing to be honest. In fact, it still felt like the author was working for Dartmouth Admissions and was actively recruiting. I found the book to be very biased and self-congratulatory towards those exactly like the author. Not at all did I encounter any expression of compassion towards the students, it all seemed like a big dog and pony show so each college could out do the other. How does the college change or improve students once they arrive? I feel like there's much, much more that wasn't revealed here, she's not letting on to the dirty little secrets and compromises that go on everyday. I just don't believe the admissions process is an objective and honorable as what's she's making it out to be. It sounded like meat was being processed. Truth be told, anyone who has worked in admissions knows it's all about the body count. Makes me want to read ""The Admissions Mystique"" by Bill Mayher for a more honest appraisal."
3,Painfully honest,"This book does an extremely good job in explaining what goes on behind the scenes of Ivy Colleges admissions, but at the same time, gives an extremely hard time to the student with a solid, but not exceptional academic record. Let me give an accurate synopsis of a few pages in the book. Setting: 4 admissions officers are together, looking at admissions and discussing them. When one admissions officer opens the file, he says ""Oh boy. This must be the thousandth newspaper editor we had today. Pfff."" Another admissions officer then says ""And this is also the zillionth applicant today who is strong in science/math but has bad verbal skills."" (700V/800M!!!) Just an example. This book gives a painfully honest view of what really goes on behind Ivy colleges admissions. It shows that it's not true what the officers at the Ivies say: On the contrary, only the top (and I mean top) have a chance of making it."
3,Good Ivy Insights,"Hernandez's book certainly reveals many of the insider secrets of college admissions, and this book is helpful in understanding many of the things that go on in Dartmouth's admissions office. This book is certainly more helpful than Princeton Review's and Greene's college admissions books, but not as good as College Admissions Trade Secrets by Allen. Sometimes Hernandez's knowledge of college admissions seems a little too narrowly focused on Dartmouth. If you're applying to Dartmouth, this book is a must read, but if you're applying elsewhere, it may not be as helpful as those other books."
2,Informative but Very OUTDATED!!!,"I've purchased few college admission related books in preparation for my daughter (Junior). This book will be decently informative if you are not so updated on the latest college admission process & requirement. I am sure this book was a sensational hit back in 10-12 years ago!BUT, this is 2009!!!Book cover said ""Updated and Revised"" but I can't tell when it was updated and what was updated. Many details are from 1995 and the latest data is from 2000.It doesn't even cover SAT 1's Writing part. Acceptable SAT score used is way too low and an acceptance rates are too higher for 2009-2010 since data was from before 2000. There has been many new changes since 1995-2000 that this book will not help much (book will give you some ""general"" idea)."
3,A book that reveals the mystery of the admissions process,"Michele Hernandez's book, ""A Is for Admission,"" is a great piece of literature that gives high school students the opportunity to test their chances at a very selective institutions in the US. Being a high school senior actively involved in the process of application filling and essay writing, this book serves as the perfect guide to aid every part of the process. ""A is for Admission"" also provides the applicant with the most closely guarded secrets of the IVY Leaugue, such as the Admissions Index, the truth about legacies and minority recruitment. Beside the fact that Hernandez's writing sometimes seem a bit mediocre for her level of education, this book provided me with the utmost satisfaction and I'll never regret buying it."
1,a real downer...,"This book made it seem like if you didn't have a 4.0 GPA and a 1600 on your SAT that you didn't have a chance to get into the top colleges in the US, which is not true! She DID explain the admissions process, but didn't give any tips on how to increase your chances. the book was also poorly organized. Try another book besides this one."
4,Great Perspective for Most Selective School Admissions,"While I neither have children nor seek to gain admittance to any University at this point, I am involved with recruiting both for my alma mater (a Top 20 School), and my firm (global investment bank). I would absoultely recommend this read as a differentiated perspective for understanding where you son/daughter falls on the spectrum to better gauge realistic schools.Living in NYC, its all too common for seemingly gifted children to be disappointed in their college admitance outcome, and for the most part, its their failings to see what is actually valued and discounted.Additionally, a worthy read for helping you sculpt your resume while in undergrad, admissions into Ivy is not unlike getting an interview at an investment bank."
3,"Good, but dated","I found the book to be informative, but dated (12 years old as of this review). I have to believe that many of the admissions office ""lifers"" that the author occasionally describes in not-so-admiring terms have either moved on or had their eyes opened to the need to attract the best of the best. The information on the Common Application may have been accurate 12 years ago, but is wrong now: all of the highly selective schools now accept them, along with a school-specific supplement. An earlier reviewer mentioned that the acceptance rates shown are way too high. I also suspect that admissions evaluation procedures may have changed somewhat since the advent of online applications and ubiquitous computerization.I guess the bottom line is: there are gems to be mined in this book, but don't use it as your only source of information."
5,Kenneth Shore's new book is an essential tool for teachers.,It boils down all of the information teachers need to get a handle on student problems and presents that information in a straightforward and intelligent manner. The book's format makes it an ideal hands-on reference. This is a must-have for all teachers at every level of experience.
5,Teacher's Bible,Kenneth Shore has created a work of art for those of us who aren't always teaching overachievers. Bravo to him and I am eager to find his next book on the shelves.
1,Came with a spiral binding,"I was very disappointed with this book, as it came with a spiral binding, and not the paperback binding pictured. This book is over two inches thick, so the pages are already ripping out of the binding. Make sure you know how your book is bound before you purchase!"
3,Tacky but listenable,Music isn't terribly original or good but I could play it easily in the background to some friends hanging out and thats about the most I'd have expected from an artist like this anyway. Also props for finally getting your records available. This cd was incredibly hard to obtain for a long period of time.
3,thick on leg leaves diamond shapes on legs,I was disappointed with these--supposedly easy pull on--no way--they were think and had diamond pattern that were hard to get on and uncomfortable on--leaving marks on skin
2,Lots of promises; little delivery,"I've always liked to sing, but was pretty sure I didn't sound very good. Buying this book was my first attempt at improving. The first third is diagnostics (so far so good). The second (short) third is exercises that I found hard to follow. The final (long) third is really fluff--developing style, etc.Going through his book did motivate me to find a voice teacher. After a couple of years, two teachers with pretty different styles, and some significant improvement in my posture, breathing, enhanced resonance, etc, I thought it would be ineresting to go back and read Love's book again. This time I was even more disappointed because he deals so little with real issues, and many of his exercises were actually counterproductive (at least for the problems I really had).I'd give it one star, except that it did encourage me to try out a teacher."
4,Get with CD,I bought the book used and it didn't come with a CD.This book has a lot of great content but needs the CD to be functional.Buy it new.
4,Worth the money...,"I have been studying voice for about 10 months using the Seth Riggs method both from his book SINGING FOR THE STARS and from associate Speech Level Singing teachers.I found Roger Love's book to be very helpful and not at all a repeat of the Seth Riggs book.The exercizes on the CD are especially helpful and I have made some new progress.The cost of the book and CD is less than the cost of one voice lesson, but worth many times that."
1,"this book is a ""Knock-off"" of ""Singing for the Stars""","Roger Love studied for a time with Seth Riggs where he simply copied the technique Seth perfected and detailed in his book ""Singing for the Stars"" which is the definitive source for vocal technique. This book is a poor and sometimes misleading source to good vocal health.Tom McKinney...Houston, Texas"
3,Not as great as I expected ....,"I bought this book hoping it would give me more of a range since I sing mainly with chest voice. In the book, it claims to stretch your vocal cords and for you to experience ""middle voice"" but I didn't see much of a change in my voice after doing it for about 2 months straight, everyday. The exercises are fine if you just want to use them to warm up your voice, though. Roger offers a lot of good advice on how to break into the music industry and has this ""q&a"" section where normal people like you and me ask him questions about taking care of your voice and so on. If you want to buy it, make sure you already have a big range and a middle voice!!"
5,"David Glynn, artist, Glynns.com","""Worth listening to. I was glad to find out something right away in this book, - I was speaking too softly, which Roger Love warned me was the Most stressful thing you can do. A very concise book by co-author Donna Frazier who also co-wrote 2 books with Susan Forward."
1,There is no CD!,"I bought this item a while ago from the book store, and was very happy with it, but I lost the cd, so I ordered this one, to have the cd again, and I was sent a softcover book with NO cd! I cannot believe that you would send me something that clearly states ""Instructional cd included"" when there is no cd included. Am I now expected to repackage this and send it back?"
1,Disaster,I purchase this title used. That was a big mistake. The book was supposed to come with an instructional CD instead it came with a CD from ABBA the famous vocal group.
2,Karaoke level book,"At first I thought the book was interesting, but having afterwards read ""Diagnostic and Correction of Vocal Faults"" by James McKinney, I found Roger Love's book innacurate at least and plain wrong in some places. This might be a good book for someone who wants to sing with a microphone for a basement rock band and have at least some resemblance of a trained voice, but for someone who is serious about singing (e.g. opera, Church choir), get the McKinney book."
4,It Does Help,"The few lessons on the included cd are worth having and really help to both get a better feel for singing more naturally and work great as a warm-up for practice, recording or shows."
2,Be free. . . but don't believe everything you read,"Snake oil? No, not quite. Ripoff? Nooo. Lack of research? Definitely!Mr. Love likes to drop names of singing stars to obfuscate his lack of research in physiology (and very little in anatomy). Why he didn't consult with ENT's or speech language pathologists is beyond me. His wild and absolute certainty about ""middle voice"" and its ""zipper"" physiology is unforgiveable when experts on the subject of voice like Sataloff, Colton, Casper and, Boone are accessible.There is so much that is wrong physiologically in his firm representations it would take another book to refute them all. Mr. Love should stay with the mental imagery he professess, such as imagining your exhaled air the color red, etc. When he leaves this domain and tries to explain physiology he runs smack into this thing called science.Before Mr. Love writes his next book I highly recommend he observe singing vocal cords via stroboscopy first."
5,Beautiful Boy,"Do not be swayed by the two negative, clearly agenda-driven reviews below. Mr. Hudson is easily the funniest and most subversive new young male writer in America. He sets his pages on fire with formal innovation, verbal dexterity, dark absurdist humor, satire, and a resonant sense of sadness for the tragedy inherent in the human condition. I study literature, and consider myself to be fairly well-versed in literature from not only the past fifty years, but the past several hundred years. Simply put, there is no book about war that is remotely like Dear Mr. President. It is that rarest of birds, a truly necessary book."
3,Tepid at best,"A disappointment here - a somewhat one dimensional story along some rather incredulous lines. The whole plot seemed too artificial, too contrived and ultimately could not achieve my involvement as the reader. The H/H are not especially attractive and nothing in the narrative makes them sparkle and I found it hard to empathise with either of them. The Duchess frankly annoyed me to the point where I wanted to scream. I barely finished this one; I had nothing else to read whilst waiting for someone at a prolonged medical appointment. I can't recommend it and hovered between 2 and 3 stars for this novel."
1,Poor quality,"I agree with the two poor reviews above. I bought a bunch of these from Staples and have had nothing but problems. They are not compatiable with alot of players, and the ereeor rate is very high, not to mention that we they do work and you go back to them a few years later guess what you have, a disc that won't play."
5,singer & songwriter extraordinnaire,"Truly a 'Best Of' that encompasses the many faces of Kirsty MacColl. Flying solo she achieved greatness in her own right and writing as in 'They Don't Know'; 'He's On The Beach'; 'Free World'; 'Don't Come The Cowboy With Me Sunny Jim!' and many more. Her rendition of 'Fairytale of New York' with The Pogues is absolutely folk-rock-heart spot on. And these days it has been meaning a lot to me in pre-Christmas 2002...Equally. she makes her version of 'New England' something one can only bow before. Lou Reed's 'Perfect Day' is more touching than ever. And her own 'Titanic Days' quite sublime.Her loss was great, certainly - more than a certainty. But let's be grateful for all that she left us. Her talent, her wit, her voice, her good taste, her unique folk-rockability lending itself to so many unique melodies!"
3,okay compilation but with an extraordinary song,"I am not a big fan of this artist. She is really good but does a wide assortment of different styles. i'm into the rock stuff rather than the torch songs.However, ""They Dont Know"" is a magical, priceless and special song. It sounds so nostalgic, like its from yesteryear, yet it is also firmly rooted in a contemporary vein. It cops such an attitude yet at the same time connotes innocence. MacColl's emotional, everyday voice enhances the tune b/c it makes the song sound very conversational...like a friend is opening their diary and talking to you.This is worth the price just to have that song on it as the lead off track."
3,Had to be there...,"CdeB is a performer with great charisma and having seem him hold an audience spellbound with just his guitar and voice I was eagerly anticipating this live solo set.Unfortunately, it just doesn't quite work. The song selection and performance is great, but at nearly 2.5 hours long the album just does not hold your interest in the same way a live show would.The real shame is that if it had been edited down to a single disc it would have been a fantastic live set and the perfect companion piece to the vastly superior ""High on Emotion"" concert album.As it stands, it is a great souvenir for those who attended the show, but for the rest of us it is not concise enough to pack a real punch."
3,OK.,"OK pen. does not dry out quickly... and cause lot of bleeding... However, great grip and fun to write... But I would not write on paper.... Even on thickest paper it bleeds.."
2,A big bummer,We purchased this last year for our son's 4th birthday. It took my husband (an architect) nearly an hour to assemble. Within 10-minutes our kiddo had reduced it to a pile of rubble and was begging his dad to build it again. Today it sits in pieces and in a box in his closet. It's a shame because we own (and love) nearly all the Imaginext dinosaurs. I suppose every line has a dud and this is definitely Fisher Price's.
1,dinosaur disaster,The dinosaur mountain consistently came apart and was very fustrating for my son because everytime he would play with it it would come apart.After 2 weeks it went in the garbage.very disappointed
1,Just pain,Buying this toy is just like buying pain... There are 50 or so moving parts and its tough to do the assembly and manage it after the assembly is done. Its just waste of money and not worth for its price.
1,Falls apart,My son got this for Christmas and we put it together the day he got it. It NEVER stayed together. We kept putting it back together but it always ended up being in pieces. I sold it at a yard sale for $8. Don't buy it. Instead get the Imaginext jungle! It's in one piece and it folds up for storage. It has a handle on top so kids can take it with them to play any where. It even has lights and sounds!
1,Disappointed,"[...] I paid about [...] for it 2 years ago and we've never been able to get the thing together again without directions and even then was very difficult to put together. My kids want to play with it, but become frustrated trying to set it up. I would not recommend this product, though I would recommend all of the Imaginext dinosaur accessories, they are quite fun with the noises and motions."
1,ANNOYING!!!,"I purchased this as a gift from Walmart for 18.00. I thought it would be great for my nephew (age 4). However, we opened it up and it was nightmare. Hundreds of tiny pieces that need to be assembled. The directions are pathetic - little pictures to distinguish the pieces and they all look pretty similar. And when it was all set up (FINALLY), it falls apart instantly as the boys play with it. Then we have to look at the directions to find out how to put it back together. Couldn't be more aggravating. I had purchased the Bat Cave first and it was so well put together in the box, I figured this would be the same. Beware. If you purchase this for your kids - make sure you put it back together first (leave yourself a good hour or 3!) and don't lose the directions!!!"
1,Abandon hope all ye who attempt assembly!,"The product description mentions adult assembly required, as do all of the other imaginext products we have purchased in the past. What it doesn't say is the shock one feels when opening the box to be confronted with a multitude of nondescript pieces. The instructions are images of line drawings left to be deciphered by the user since none of the pieces are labeled or in any type of order. After attempting to decipher, assemble and then realizing that assembly would not stay together in this poorly designed toy I reboxed the pieces and called it a night.This item is not even close to being the quality of the dragon castle, batman, space shuttle and accessory pieces in the other imaginext line."
2,Horrible assembly!!,"I had wondered why I found this so cheap...only 19.99 last Christmas. I can only imagine it was so inexpensive, because it is impoosible to put together!! We tried to assemble it a few times, but it never worked out (I'm convinced we are missing a few pieces!) The instuctions are basically just pictures and nothing is coded, so it's hard to figure out. This year, I'm getting my son the Imaginext Batman Batcave, which was a hugh hit with my nephew last year...and comes fully assembled! Unless you have tons of time on your hands and lots of patience, I don't suggest buying the t-rex."
3,Once you glue the thing together it's great!,"Imaginext very rarely disappoints, but we finally found a bit of a stinker! We didn't realize that the T-Rex Mountain came apart so easily. We first put it together for our boys, and they loved it. Then they took it apart after like 2 days. After it sat in a pile for about 3 months, my husband glued the thing together. Now it is the most popular toy in the house. Please be warned that if you buy the T-Rex Mountain that it disassembles very easily. It is a great toy once you take the time to actually glue it together!"
1,"What they said, except more so...","Please do not under any circumstance buy this toy for someone else's child because you will make them hate you and your child. A lot of people here mentioned that it fell apart, but putting it together is ""imaginenext"" to impossible. Curse this toy!"
4,Falls Apart But My Boys Love It,"As several other reviewers have mentioned, this thing is difficult to put together and falls apart frequently. I purchased two of the T-Rex Mountains, one for my grandson and one for my nephew. Thank goodness I have a ""geek husband"" who managed to put it together when I failed. The second time was much easier for him to complete.Both of the sets fell apart when they were moved. My daughter said that my grandson plays with it every day but mentioned how fragile it was and I suggested gluing it permanently. She tried and was pleased with the results. Now I just have to glue my nephew's set because he plays with it every weekend when he visits.So I'm not thrilled that it falls apart easily, but both of the boys love this set. If it would have stayed together, I would have rated it 5 stars but because of the difficulty of putting it together and the useless directions, in addition to it falling apart, I will give it 4 stars."
1,Falls Apart,"I bought this toy for my child for X-mas thinking it looks awesome in the box! That was until I opened it and there are a million pieces and one paper with a picture of how it should look after you put it together. Terrible! It falls apart if you look at it hard enough. The ""buttons"" you push to make gates open up do not open, you have to mash them to get them to work or pry them open with your hands and then it pulls apart anyways. If you super glue it into place it's fine but for the money I spent on it- not worth it. We have lots of other Imaginext toys that are great, So I do beleive it was just poor construction on this toy. Comes with alot of cool pieces to play with."
2,Frustrating for kids and parents,"When we took this toy out of the packaging on Christmas morning I immediately regretted buying it. It seemed like more than 30 pieces fell out of the box. My husband took 1-2 hours assembling all these pieces so it would look like the cool dinosaur mountain on the box. Once assembled, playing with the mountain will cause it to fall apart again since it is held together with shallow pegs. I wanted to shove it all in the box and return it, but my husband claims that my son plays with it sometimes. I am the only one that seems to be sitting on the floor with it, as I constantly try to piece it back together. It is a cool concept since all boys love dinosaurs and mountains, but it is not very well thought out in the design. Who needs more toy pieces every where?!"
1,$25 in the trash would have been just as effective,"This was a Christmas gift for my 4-year-old son. Unfortunately, his dad and I were attempting to assemble it in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve. Turns out the box contained NO instructions, so we could only go by the pictures on the outside of the box. Of course, the photos on the box did not actually depict every single piece contained in the box. After 1.5 hours of work, getting only half assembled, and of that only half that would actually stay together, we put it all back in the box. Yes, on Christmas Eve. In the middle of the night. When no stores were open to allow us to pick up a replacement gift. If two 30-something adults cannot assemble this product, how is a 4-year-old going to? I am very disappointed in the lack of quality offered by Fisher-Price's Imaginext line."
3,cool looking but instructions are pointless,"My son got this for Christmas this year and loved the way it looked. It took me almost 2 hours to put together! NOTHING was labled and the pics were not that detailed. I looked more at the picture on the box to put it together then using the directions. Also, the part with the dinosaur head seems as though it will not stay in place and falls. Its not very sturdy. My 5 year old son seems to enjoy playing with it though. We will see how well it holds up. Recommended but only if you dont get frustrated too easily while attempting to put it all together. Merry Christmas!"
3,dino disappointed,"My son was very excited for the mountain and it has fun features - light up eyes, slides, caves - but the mountain continual fell apart and there are not many ways to reassemble. We had kept the cover of the box and knew how to re-assemble, after 8 months I finally superglued the mountain together and it has worked great ever since."
5,Awesome dino toy,"My son got this last year for Christmas and he still plays with it often. Sometimes some of the gates or plants do fall off, but he just puts them back on. He also likes to take it apart and re-arrange the pieces into different configurations. This toy is great for the imagination.Although, if a child played rough with this toy it would come apart a bit more often. No toy is made to be pounded on or abused. Also, this is not good for children younger than 3 or children who have not developed their fine motor control."
2,"Looks good, BUT",Once you put it together it constantly falls apart and ends up one big mess all over the floor etc. I wish it was something that you could put together once and it stays together.I did notice that Imaginext's new Castle looks like it is constructed a little better and a little more permanent.
1,Broke my kid's heart,Fell apart Christmas day. My husband struggled with it several times but it always falls apart after a few minutes of play. My son was so disappointed. He lit up when he saw it under the x-mas tree. A day later it was a pile of junk.
3,Lots of Pieces,"I must admit, I didn't read the description very clearly before buying this for my 3-year old. Had I know that it could be taken apart and reassembled I would not have bought it. He likes to play with it and it's a lot of fun once I have it put together. But as a 3-year old boy, he tends to get a little excited with his dinosaurs and the ""mountain"" falls apart. It's not easy enough for him to reassemble - so i find that i am constantly referring to the directions while I try to put it back together.It's a fun toy. Great for any dinosaur lover - but I would recommend getting it for an older child who can appreciate the concept of being able to re-design the mountain vs. a parent having to constantly put it back together."
1,Piece of Junk,We bought this for our 3 year old for Christmas 2005. While we were putting together the MANY pieces it kept falling apart. We have even tried super glueing the structure together and nothing works. Do NOT buy this toy.
2,falls apart too easily!,"My 3 year old son got this last Christmas. He REALLY loved it and played with it all the time. But, it came apart very easily and every time he played with it. Because it came apart so often, a few pieces were lost. I ended up getting rid of it and he was very, very upset. It got extremely annoying having to put it back together everyday. If it was made a little sturdier it would have been a wonderful toy and would have gotten 5 stars."
3,Not worth the money.,"We have 2 of these. My sons enjoy them for the few minutes that the pieces stay together. I shouldn't have to glue it. It should be sturdy enough that it stays together. It costs enough that a person should be able to count on it being a quality product. The dinosaurs are fun, but this mountain isn't worth the bother."
4,Just glue it!,"My 5 year old son received this toy for Christmas. As many reviewers have pointed out, it is way too difficult for a 5 year old to build. Once built by mom and dad (it does take quite a while) he had a lot of fun but it would fall too easilly. We ended up gluing it together so we would not have to remember how it got together, once more... Since we glued it, my son has had the best time playing with the set."
2,HORRIBLE! FALLS APART! CHEAP!,"My 4 yo received the dinos for Christmas and loves those. However, dino mountain falls apart all the time. It has finally been put up in our garage because it falls apart so much and makes such a mess. I really wanted to like this play set and so did my son, but it is such a headache and very disappointing that it falls apart so easily!"
3,Santa gift,I bought this for my 4 year old son who saw how great this was on TV. We got it open Christmas Day and it took my forever putting it together. Then within minutes it had fallen apart. We have since then thrown it away. I wished he could have enjoyed it better.
1,Falls apart VERY easily!,"Got this for our 3 and 5 year olds who love all their Imaginext stuff. We usually LOVE Imaginext stuff. This thing is just a big pain in the butt to put together. The directions are terrible and once it is together it falls aparts constantly. Maybe this would be okay for an older child who would enjoy changing around the configuration, but for little kids... they just want it to stay together. I plan on super-gluing it."
1,Don't waste your money,I found these reviews searching for instructions on how to put this toy back together. I didn't find instructions so I ended up putting the toy in a plastic bag in the bottom of the closet. My son is 3 and the toy stayed together for about a week - I lost the instructions so now the toy is considered a total loss. What a piece of junk! This is my first experience w/ Imaginext toys and I will NEVER purchase one again.
3,A Waste of 40 bucks,"I probably would not recommend this toy, it is too hard to assemble and does not stay together. The interset level does not match the ability level needed to put it together and this just becomes a hassle for the parents. In other words, if your kid like dinosuars, they are probably too young to actually put this toy together. One parent said they thought of gluing it together. Good idea, but what a hassle. I am certain that my husband printed out the instruction for assembly at least 3 times."
3,Is just an ok toy.,We bought this for our 5 year old a year ago and had to glue it because it kept falling apart! It was terrible to put bacck together agin. Our boys loved it but beware it needs to be glued the first time you put it togther or you will doing it agin.
2,Toy is okay,"My four year old was sold on this at the minute he saw it. It was the top of his santa list. He played with it daily; but the plants would fall off and it was very hard for him to put together afterr it fell apart. It is now in a million pieces and he has not touched it since. He still likes it; but the problem withthis is that once you take it apart, it is not easy for the four year or five year old to put together. Fair but not great."
4,A year later and still going strong!,"I got this last year for my then 4-year-old. That started the ball rolling and now he has almost all of the Imaginext sets. Yes, they come apart but that, my friends, is part of the fun. The sets can be taken apart, reconfigured, combined, etc. Right now, all are put together and in his room. Maybe I'm just one of those parents who enjoys putting these things together. Be patient with yourselves, patient with your kids and patient with the toys and you'll all have fun."
2,Like it but it falls apart,"The title pretty much says it. My son likes it and finally tonight I'm going to hot glue gun it together. I had to get online to figure out how to put it back together. Oh well, he likes it. I did tell him that if it falls apart again after I glue it then I will probably throw it away."
2,Third circle of hell--some assembly required,"This ""toy"" must have 500 seperate parts, all of which have to be put together in a very specific sequence (the set up guide is inaccurate, just to make it a little more difficult). And when you do finally get it all put together, the first time you so much as touch it, it falls apart into all it's component elements. Very cool-looking, but you need to keep it behind glass. Frustrating for the parent to assemble, frustrating for the kid to play with."
2,What a disaster!,My son just got this for Christmas and it is sitting in pieces all over the floor. It takes forever to put together. Once you have it together the moment your child touches it it falls apart. You can't breathe on this thing without it falling apart. I get the idea that it comes apart and can be rearranged to make different mountains but my kid has no interest in doing that. He just wanted a dinosaur playset that he could actually play with. Tomorrow I will invest in krazyglue and make sure it never falls apart again. I would NOT recommend this toy to anyone.
1,Read before buying.,"While this toy looks like alot of fun it is a nightmare to put together, the directions are not good. It continualy falls apart. We spend more time trying to put it together then actually playing with it. We have many imaginext toys, which my boys love, but this was by far the worst. Very disappointed!!!!! This is a poorly constructed toy and will only frustrate you and your child, buyer beware!!!!"
2,don't waste your money,The directions were very unclear for this toy. It kept falling apart while I was putting it together. It is a cheap piece of [...]! I wouldn't reccomend it to any parent.
1,Walking through the desert would be a pleasure.,"compared to reading this book...First, I may be one of a few score of Americans who have first edition hardcovers of 22 Gerald Seymour novels. Great stories, must reads!Second, there is a blurb on the back cover of this book that says,"" Once in the final 150 pages, you will not be able to stop for a cup of tea or even breathe much"". The reason is ....you'll be in a coma!Third, at page 300 I'd rather have been in a sun-drenched desert with a fetid camel blowing snot on me than reading this book.Fourth, I am sorry this book wasn't a suicide-booker.I've watched my child grow-up while I tried to finish this classic sleep-inducer. An endorcement blurb from the FDA would be more appropriate!If this is the future of Seymour factional writing, send the bombs my way. This obviously was the first salvo."
1,Practically worthless,"I agree wholeheartedly with the last review. This out of date book gives advice that is a little too ""practical"" so much so that it is almost useless. I simply don't understand why this book was written. And it is too simplistic in its outlook. Sorry, news stories aren't that clean. Worthless."
5,Great book written with honesty!,"This book is totally entertaining. I appreciate Donny's honesty and humor. I saw Donny in Las Vegas (he even kissed me) and I thought he was great then and still is now. I respect his love for religion and his faith and his family values. I think he is talented and now gained another talent of being able to write a great book. I truly enjoyed this book, I read it in two day! I had a smile on my face for two days as well. Good story!!!"
5,Couldn't put it down,"What a read!! I could not put the book down and have found myself drawn back to read it again. I often find autobiographies tedious, but was pleased to read this one. The style is engaging -- I felt as if I were in the room listening to an old friend talk about his life. Donny Osmond really can tell a story! The book made me laugh out loud at times and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. It is refreshing to see an entertainer who has a positive outlook on life, despite some very hard times. I grew to respect and admire Donny Osmond as a person through reading his story. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be uplifted as well as entertained."
3,Donny ain't smiling,"Forget the cover of Donny giving his toothy grin. He ain't smiling in this biography. He tells of his pain and torment of growing up as a child in show business, and also discusses his stage fright. What shocked me was the anger he expressed about people referring to his teenage idol years. Once he even tried to chase some ""fans"" who were teasing him, but, luckily, his wife stopped him. I gave this three stars because I'm not sure his story is over yet. He's a survivor and we will continue to hear about changes in his career as he overcomes his fears."
5,A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE,"Donny Osmond is nothing more than extraordinary!! This man has gone through more changes in his personal and professional life that noone could ever imagine, and he has handled those changes with nothing more than exceptional grace! At a time when the music industry would second guess him every move he made, he rose above them (industry watchers) and showed them that with age comes wisdom. He definitely has gained and given alot of wisdom through his 37 years of being in show business. The industry and the general public can definitely learn something from this book"
5,Very Inspirational!!! :),I just recieved the book in the mail this morning and I haven't been able to put it down since. He is truly an unique person and his story can be very uplifting. I could relate with some of the things he had written and certain situations that he has been in as I have been in them also. This book is TRULY a page turner. We need more of these kinds of these uplifting books in print. I hope he continues his story further on down the road. He's got me hooked.
4,Best Auto I have read in a while!,"One of the best bios I have read in a long time. I have always loved the Osmonds over the last 25 years or so. This books does let us know that ""families are forever""."
5,Very Respectable Guy,"Loved Donny as a kid as well as the Osmond music. This book is so well written and honest one can't help but have even greater admiration and respect for Donny. How he's dealt with fame, family, politics within the family, disappointment, and success is a great example for the rest of us to follow. Highly recommended even if you aren't a Donny or Osmond fan and just want to read an inspirational book. It is not a religious recount either, although of course he references his religion periodically (he isn't proselytizing in any way). Thanks Donny!"
2,Too Many Words Too LIttle Honesty,"I love biographies and I loved the Donny and Marie show as a kid. I thought I would really like this book, but it was very poorly written. It is amazing to me the Donny Osmond had the help of a professional.Donny spent so much of the book defending the actions of his obviously controlling father, a situation so common when children become entertainers. The book did not come across as real. He spent too much time trying to spare everyone's feelings. He spent too much time talking about how great his family was when they very clearly weren't.There didn't need to be dirt, but it seems the author still has not come to terms with his family situation while growing up. I hope he writes a more honest book some day when he is older."
2,This book needs a good editor,"This was the first book I bought about the Monkees, but I returned it almost immediately for a refund, I was so disappointed. The book is in serious need of an editor. Spelling, grammar, and style errors abound. It is just one long rambling account of how the author and some fans feel about the Monkees. I highly recommend The Monkees Tale and Monkeemania, for both content and pictures. Both books are filled with numerous quotes from the Monkees and others involved with the group from the beginning, and many great pictures, as well as discographies and episode guides."
1,"The Monkees, Memories & the Magic","This book is so poorly edited -- I was not able to finish reading it. I was so excited for a new Monkees book to be released and then was disappointed when I received it.Not to ridicule those who put it together, but it seems as though it was put together quickly, without thought and no attention to detail. Their high level of adoration for the Monkees (which I share) may have clouded their reasoning for putting out this quality of material (i.e., proving their love by producing some sort of a book). My respect for writing makes me sad that a book of this quality was produced.I would not recommend purchasing this book."
4,Its more than just a hard steel...it actually sharpens.,This unit has an oval shape and is wide. It surface is encrusted with tiny diamond dust particles that actually sharpen the knife. This may be good or bad. I'm still using this unit and evaluating it. It is between a carbide sharpener that you run over the blade and the final hard steel that you straighten out the final edge on a fine knife. So far it looks like it will fit in nicely.
3,"Henckels ""Diamond"" Sharpening Steel","Wasn't happy with this product, thinking the diamond version would last longer than the regular, it didn't. The diamond dust wears very quickly, especially if you sharpen knives a lot. It worked great at first but the diamond dust seemed to come off the steel after a weeks worth of sharpening. Did not expect this type of quality issue from J A Henckels as they make very high quality knives... sorry, but I'd give this one a miss and choose the traditional steel."
4,Brought my knives back to life,"I bought this sharpener to try and salvage a couple of Henckels knives that my college roommates had destroyed over the past couple years. After watching a video on the correct way to sharpen knives, I used this sharpener and instantly noticed a dramatic change in the knife edge. Would highly recommend.Be sure to read up on honing vs. sharpening, I've read that those electronic sharpeners can actually ruin your knives, as can incorrect sharpening methods."
5,Diamond hone,"I ordered this product based on the Henckels reputation. While there were some ordering issues, they were satisfactorily resolved and I am totally pleased with the hone."
4,Great Sharpener!,"We just received this today and my husband of one month has proceeded to put a very sharp edge back on each knife in our Henckels knife set. The reason for four stars instead of five? When it arrived, the sharpener was not round, as I expected, but a two-sided oval sharpener. Although it is very easy to use and does a great job, it arrived with no directions. For someone who has never used this type of sharpener before they may not find it as easy to use. But for those of you (like my husband) would say ""All I care about is that it sharpens the knives and it does a great job."" (A direct quote from one who prides himself on putting a good edge on our knives. As a matter of fact he is scouring the neighborhood looking for more knives to sharpen.)"
2,Find another book.,"I found this to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. Not recommended at all. While explaining different situations in the book, the authors jump all over the place and finally come back to the point I think they were trying to achieve. The one plus, a ton of interviews with eye-witnesses. As you read through, these testimonies become too much and too often.If you are trying to learn the history of the Troubles (not specifically Bloody Sunday)I recommend Belfast Diary or Killing Rage. I just started on The History of the IRA by Coogan and I am already hooked. I'm only a couple chapters in, but I feel it will be a great book."
3,"Good Content, Biased View","This is a book that examines the events leading up to, and encompassed by, the infamous Bloody Sunday incident in Derry, Northern Ireland. One of the book's strong points is the level of detail with which the events of the day are examined. However, the analysis seems to be biased in favor of the nationalists. Still, there is alot of valuable content in the book as long as one recognizes that it represents but one point of view and is not necessarily impartial. For some additional information, there is some valuable commentary on Bloody Sunday in Tony Geraghty's book ""The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence""."
3,A bit over-extended and cliched.,"Growing pains? Or Growing pains of a rich and spoiled teenager who in the meantime trying too hard to get [fun] experiences? Murdering his mother with his brother or actually liberated her? Is this a dangerous suggestion to all the teenagers if they might have the same situation at home, in the family? Lots of purposeless ... ugliness of human relationship, too cliched to be appreciated. A very pretentious movie trying too hard to be looked as thoughtful and deep but turning out in the end shallow and mindless."
1,Wasted 90 minutes,"Why the hell do people think a movie good? Because it is a ""black comedy"" that deals with coming of age, rich folks, drugs, and Manhatten. The story is lost in its attempt to be ultra cool and hip with no compelling story. What story there is wasted on totally cynical characters of which one has no empathy. Sorry I trusted the ""top 10"" lists."
1,Igby Thumbs Down,"Passé, joyless film peopled with pseudo-intellectual and emotionally constipated characters wandering around with nowhere to go ""but down."" Pessimists of the world unite."
1,Don't Bother...,"The sometimes stellar acting cannot save this film from itself. I went in expecting something great, especially from all the hype that enveloped this movie during it's theatrical release. I was treated instead to a bland and pointless Catcher in the Rye rip-off that goes nowhere.The movie strives to be great, and I kept expecting it to do something--anything--but fall flat. The worst part is that this should have been good; I wanted it to be a good film, as there's a real lack of stories of this nature. The only saving grace was the performance of Jeff Goldblum, and a few snatches of nice dialogue that are wasted on the end result. In contrast to other reviews, I didn't find Culkin's performance especially notable, either.If you're looking for a story with a similar underlying theme, I suggest reading Salinger's novel."
2,IGBY'S A BORE,"Simply put, IGBY GOES DOWN just didn't work for me. The characters were one-dimensional and unconvincing and the plot fell short. While striving to be a dark comedy about an affluent Manhattan adolescent boy searching to understand the meaning of life amongst his dysfunctional family members, I quickly became bored and uninterested. I was disappointed that Igby's motivations were never explored or even hinted at. He simply appeared to be just another rich kid rebelling against society. While the cast of this film is impressive, only the father (Bill Pullman) provided an exceptional performance as the mentally ill father. Otherwise I failed to feel any sympathy for the others and didn't care what happened to them.Maybe I just don't get it? Maybe I was in the wrong frame of mind when I watched this film? Nobody knows. What I can say with any assurance is that I had high expectations for IGBY GOES DOWN."
1,It was irritating to watch.,"I'd heard good things about this movie. I live in a medium sized town that's home to an extremely liberal university. Watching the movie was irritating. I couldn't really appreciate any of the characters and all the whining, Jeez! It was like dealing with a spoiled college kid. Such victims. Put away the Kleenex, do something you enjoy and make this world a better place. However, if feeling sorry for yourself is your thing-this is your movie.Watch a movie that's more fun than this one. You'll feel happier at the end."
1,Complete Utter Boredom,"This movie is compared to Salinger's ""Catcher In The Rye."" I was mortified when I saw the movie. I am a great fan of Salinger and to think you can compare this movie to any of his novels (especially ""Catcher In The Rye"") just makes my stomach turn. I thought it was a complete waste of time and talent."
1,Dreck,"I had to post a review after seeing that the Amazon editors chose this empty, unwatchable movie as one of the best DVDs of 2003. Who are these editors? This movie doesn't simply lack a heart, it doesn't have a head, either. It pretends to be clever and edgy, but it's derivative without even understanding what it's trying to imitate. Try to care about the characters in this film--it's not possible. Don't waste your time with this steaming turd of a movie. Instead, read (or reread) Catcher in the Rye; or watch Rushmore, Tadpole, Harold & Maude, or Donnie Darko. Do situps in a dark room, or just watch bowling on TV while eating some pork rinds. Any of these options will be time better spent than watching this hollow cadaver of a ""comedy."""
1,Never Recieved,"Tried to contact, never received an answer and just plain never received anything in the mail, although I ordered another dvd the same day and I received in in a week form another seller."
2,"Considerable style, but no center.","I couldn't plug into ""Igby Goes Down."" I tried and failed. Ultimately, Burr Steers' movie is intended to be some sort of hip comedy -- the ribald music sountrack would clue you into that -- and I didn't laugh. The humor, however black, is the entry point into this movie through which you reach the deeper, sadder veins. That way, you can see Igby the way Steers does, as troubled but brave, and brazen, as a kid jerk trying to keep his head above the fray by his wits and fears.Because I snuck in the back door, so to speak, I found Igby depressing and his sophiscation juvenile. I was like the shrink in the movie's opening scenes, who smacks Igby upside the head. You can't really like a movie that's this frustrating, can you?The movie's opening half hour, I have to admit, put me in a foul mood with all its itty bitty scenes and tonal shifts. Steers takes a long time to settle down, and by then, I've had it."
3,big whoop,"yet another movie that rips off catcher in the rye. yet another movie where ryan phillipe plays a jaded rich kid. yet another movie that was merely ""ok""."
1,A rotten film about rotten people,Very strange to have a film where every single character in the movie is a cynical egotistical self absorbed spoiled immature brat.
2,"Brilliant screenplay and performances, bummer movie","I don't know, I love supreme things. This had it all. But, and it's a big butt, the movie was depressing and at the end, I have to say ""why bother!"""
3,good,i thought this was a good movie. kirean culkin does a great job. it was defineitly isnpired by rhe catcher in the rye. however since the saligner put a ban on anyof his books being turne in movies they nmade this homage to it.You really care for igby in a lesser movie your would want to tell him to grow up.i hope they rember kirean at oscar time.
2,no good,"A clever script doesn't make for an enjoyable film. I find every Culkin to be a disgrace to acting, while the other actors are just plain annoying. Much of the dialogue seems sophisticated beyond the characters intellect. The plot is dollar-paper thin and a steal from various books and films. By the end of the movie, you hope that not only does Sarandon's character die, but that Igby goes six feet down."
4,Bloody Brilliant,"The fact that the reviews of this DVD are so varied makes me love it even more. It is aloof and heartbreaking and witty and dark. If you liked Catcher In The Rye and The Graduate you have to see this film and then decide for yourself if it is the worst movie ever or the second coming. I loved every minute of it. The performances are sterling and the dialouge will have you reaching for a pen and paper ever other scene. Amanda should have gotten an Oscar nomination and for that unexpected thing alone, it is a great."
1,not good or structured,"this was reviewed with greatness by the critics. it is long ,boring , unfunny , and very dry. i could have wrote this screenplay but i would have put real comedy. dont rent unlessyour artsy fartsy."
2,It would have been better with Macaulay Culkin,I thought this movie was very quirky and sad. But I also thought there were some parts that were very confusing and discraseful. Like the scene where Igby'S (Kieran Culkin) godfather beats the [...] out of him. And I also thought that it was so sad when Igby's mother (Susan Sarandon) dies. So I guess the film wasn't so bad. But I still think the movie would have been a hit with Macaulay Culkin.
2,I didn't like it,"I was really disappointed in the movie. The trailers made it look like this kid was going to be really different and alternative, but he seemed just kind of annoyed but not that amazing. I thought it was stupid."
2,Igby Is Bad!,"The only redeeming feature of this ""Comedy"" is the pinpoint-perfect performance of the Waspy, preppy-bro, Ryan Phillippe. I suppose I thought this character capable of intelligent thought, but unfortunately, the script makes him do two so unfunny things, I can't reveal the horror without blowing the script.Look, I know everyone thinks Freud was wrong about homosexuality's derivation related to weak fathers and strong Ethel Merman like mothers, but this film is set up in such a way that I am convinced that the two brothers could not possibly be straight. I think that is a defect in the plot. Sexually they are normal, having sex with two beautiful girls, but, nahhh, I don't believe it from all the perversion of their world; why would they be straight?Black comedies are by definition laughs from unexpected sources, but we at least have to like the characters in a film to care about their problems. By the end of this film, I wanted Igby to do drugs and die."
1,a truly awful film,"Once I heard those first few quirky notes in the first scene of ""Igby Goes Down"",I knew I was in for a long,painful ride.Basically,""Igby"" is a cliche-ed Hollywood film poorly disguised as an independent film.The acting is poor (especially Sarandon).The writing is even worse.The script is so bad,that it relies on the soundtrack in order to set mood-sort of like a bad children's film or romantic comedy.The film is so awful,that it tainted my memories of ""The Catcher in the Rye""!The only good thing about it was that it proved a long discussed theory-the rich have it so good that they have to invent problems in order to prevent dying from boredom.Besides,I know a movie can't be too thought-provoking if it has either a)Bill Pullman in it or b) Coldplay in the soundtrack."
4,"ODD, BUT GOOD","Igby Goes Down was an extremely witty and entertaining movie. It had some parallels with ""Catcher in the Rye,"" most notably, the main character, Igby. ""Igby Goes Down"" and ""Catcher and the Rye's"" main characters [Holden Caufield] were both outcasts with troubled lives. Although other than that, the similarities ended. The reason this movie worked is that even though Igby made some bad decisions, one still cared about him Kieran Culkin did an excellent part as what has become his niche, the sarcastic, troublemaking pariah. The supporting cast was also excellent with actors in roles one might not expect them to inhabit. (Susan Surandon, Bill Pullman, Claire Danes) This movie was really good, and I would definitely suggest anyone to see it, especially if the person loves the unusual."
1,BS,"HTH treads on very thin ice when attempting to correct Azerrad on the ""In Utero"" songs. Cross alleges that Courtney Love, Cobain's spouse, had a very considerable impact on and input in Cobain's songwriting. The evidence he employs to back up his claim varies from shaky to obviously fallacious. Cross devotes two paragraphs to extolling Love's contribution to ""Pennyroyal Tea"", claiming that she wrote many of the lyrics and helped with the music. The fact that NIRVANA played the song at the soundcheck of a concert in April 1991 , some seven months before Cobain began dating Love, reveals that Cross is certainly mistaken.This book is full of lies like this. Don't buy this book."
4,one of the better rock bio's i've read.,"rock biographies are not the genre in which to find great literature. seldom are they anything special. this one is pretty darn good, though. charles r. cross sets a high standard, with a complex portrait of this troubled rock genius. this is no hero worship account. kurt cobain is portrayed as the exasperating, contradictory person he know doubt was. warts and genius are juxtaposed here. a tale of cobain's rise from very ordinary beginnings to his ulimate self-destruction at the top of rock and roll's ladder. the narrative is well paced and the journalistic writing style fine. a very very good piece of work. charles r. cross has done nirvana fans a service."
3,OK,"Good book if you know something before... Otherwise, you could feel dissapointed, given the tone of the book... good resource for Nirvana and Cobain facts"
1,"Terrible book, should be labeled fiction","This is probably the worst book on Kurt Cobain ever written; it's even worse than Sandford's. The author gets many things completely wrong, things that can be checked easily and verified. He comes up with an elaborate ending for the time when Kurt died, when no one really knows what eactly happened. There are many more books that are better than this, such as Come As You Are. Don't waste your money on this; if you need to read it check your local library."
2,Arrogant author,"This book was well written, well under some circumstances. Charles R. Cross is an arrogant author as clearly noted in the title of this review. He thinks he knew everything about Kurt, when the fact is... he never met the man! Michael Azzerad who really met Kurt and acted as his official biographer should be the one acts this way, even his family doesnt act the way CRC does. Charles is like oh, I touched the heart shaped box, oh I touched his guitars. so what! we're not looking at your interviews and books to see what you have done man! On the chapter where Kurt dies, he says""kurt put the rifle into his mouth"" or whatever I mean c'mon dude you must be stupid or think the fans are stupid to think that you know exactly how he died! No one does, if the man was murdered only a few people know I guess. Only god knows some of the details he added.. Overall good book, good detail thats my only problem with this book. fun to read but Who killed Kurt Cobain is the greatest Cobain book.."
3,Book ok,"ummmmmmmm book is bad to terrible shape. Did not expect That!!!!!!! Dirty, smelly, stained, yucky but I kept it cuz I hate the rigamarole of exchanging etc. Money back would be nice since I was lied to."
5,Best Kurdt Kobain biography written.,"Cross wrote a book that read like a novel that showed the somewhat epic journey Kurt was on from being a poor kid nowhereville Washington to being the biggest musician of a time period changing music as we knew it, and then burning out."
3,"Excellent access, decent writing","Charles R. Cross is clearly a guy who can make a stone talk. He dove into a world that can be very closed off from the media and came back with incredibly open quotes. The result is that the reader knows exactly what's going on in Cobain's life down the most minute detail. I can't imagine how hard the reporting was to pull off.But Cross is one of those reporters who is such a reporter's reporter that it's as if he thinks writing will get in the way. It's like, no, dude, you can both find all the details and present them so that we want to read them and find out what happens."
3,I just don't know,"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. The (supposed)Details of kurt's life in this book is amazing. Its all beleive-able. But... It details Kurt's last hours of life and the thoughts in his mind when there wasn't any human contact even around him and also the fact the author has never met Kurt Cobain cast suspicion. In truth noone should be reading any books about him, only enjoying his music and his opinions on life, which can comfort and teach us about more important issues then his suicide or murder.I recommend reading this book about his suicide. Objectively. Then reading a book about his murder. Objectively."
5,Heavier Than Heaven,This is by far the best Kurt Cobain biography that has been released. I am a die hard Nirvana fan and thought i knew everything about Kurt upon reading this book i learned so much more. You would think Charles Cross lived Kurt's life because absolutely nothing is left out. The Ultimate Kurt Cobain Biography.
2,DEFINETLY courtney's side of the story!!!,"the book starts off great, talking about his child hood and his parents then it gets to his teen age years.i believed everything untill he met courtney,it started getting rediculous,like saying he started her on heroin ... but the worst was the second to last chapter when cross TRIES to depict what it was like when kurt acctually killed himself, he has so many details tht no one but a person who was there would know.... great book to read if u like all the details of kurts childhood but dont believe it all!!!WARNING- VERY PROFAINE BOOK, NOT GREAT TO READ WITH YOUR PARENTS AROUND"
1,A Shameful Book,"This is a ridiculous, disgusting, shameful book. Cross is obviously serving an agenda here (that of Courtney Love), and gleefully throws fact and objectivity to the wind at her behest. I highly recommend against this book unless you want to read a silly, biased work of fiction that is ""based on a true story."""
3,To be taken with a grain of salt...,"This book would be worth something if the author did not get all of his research word from word from Courtney Love. Ironically this book is actually worth reading (if you so choose) as it reveals inconsistancies to factual evidence found in the recent release of the book ""Love & Death: A New and Explosive Investigation into The Murder of Kurt Cobain."" by Max Wallace and Ian Halperin. Read that book instead and learn what really happened."
3,I've read better,"Cross is unquestionably a great writer with a knack for weaving an interesting story -Unfortunately, stories involving the life of Kurt Cobain (often, thanks to Kurt himself) are so convoluted that much of it must be taken with a grain of salt. Too many books on the Cobain's contradict eachother and themselves, and sadly, this one is no different.Different things bothered me when reading the book, such as Cross' flagrant use of artistic licence -as if imply a greater knowledge of things no one should know -a fly on the wall, if you will...Other annoyances, for example, appeared as misprinted lyrics for the *unreleased Nirvana song, You Know You're Right (*at the time of the books publication).If you're a sucker for second-hand stories, tall tales, mixed in with some well known facts, then this book is for you!"
2,what a disappointment,"if you've never known about the existence of kurt cobain, then frankly, reading this book isn't going to bring you any closer. this book is a complete disappointment. you never find out who kurt cobain as a person really was, and most especially you never find out just what it was that made him so special. if i hadn't known about kurt beforehand, i'd wonder just what the big deal was. you want to know who kurt was, this is not the book to turn to."
3,"Nothing new, but not bad.","This book compiles a lot of what is already known. It does put it all in one place and in one easy read. It gave me a total comprehensive guide of Cobain and Nirvana and that time. I knew most of the info, but still enjoyed it."
4,"Very good story telling, although you can never be sure","This is a great buy. The book reads smooth although the timelines are not always constant. There is only one outcome according this book and it tries to cover most sides of Kurt's life, including the bad sides. Fortunately it is not 'don't use drugs propaganda' which I see to often these days.Still there is some room for discussion because the author does some personal interpretation of facts and stories."
4,What else could I say?,"This is a great book, from beginning to end, it is amazingly written; jumping from time to time in Cobain's life with no rhyme or reason, but manages to flow without being too confusing. There was only one problem I had with this book, even though the book is 'unauthorized', sometimes it feels as though Courtney pressured some stuff to be a certain way, it could be that Cross and Love knew each other before the book was published, but some stuff just seemed to be purposely left out."
2,better sources,"if you're really interested in kurt cobain as a man and a musician, read michael azzerads's book or christopher sandfords' - this book adds less to the story, covers the same ground and isn't as well written as the aforementioned. it's a disappointment."
5,Truly Facinating,"This is the first book I've reviewed, so forgive me if it's not the best. This book looked deeply into the mind & life of a great artist: His highs(sometimes literally), lows, and really just what it was like to have been there day by day with him. Takes you from his early days as a child, just wanting to go down the hills on a sled w/ his family on a winter weekend, to his finnal hours of composing his finnal suiside note, and taking his finnal steps to the greenhouse. A great book, just like a novel in that you are always wondering what's coming next. A book to buy for anyone who loved or liked Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, or just wants to hear the life story of a troubled boy who never grew up."
2,About a Girl,"Ok. So I liked half of this book.I only like the first half, mostly because once Courtney Love comes into the picture, it starts turning phony. It's way overly focused on their supposedly ""happy marraige"" which wasn't as great as Cross makes it seem. Also, he subliminally instills in you throughout the book that Kurt was basically suicidal from the get-go, which only Kurt himself would know.Mostly, I HATED when Cross tried to assume what happened on Kurt's final hours.Only Kurt himself (and those possibly involved in foul play) would have known what Kurt did in his last moments alive.Good musical biography, but not a good life & love biography"
5,Heavier than honesty,"Heavier than Heaven- The title speaks for it's self. Over the past years, I've read numerous books on Nirvana and the late Kurt Cobain. But, none which covered such detail with brutal and complete honesty and emotions like Heavier than Heaven. Charles Cross really captures every moment, weather it be exciting and happy or painful. Thanks to all the wonderful people who put time to be involved in this book we now get a closer look at what happened in Cobain's short but tragic life. This is by far the best book I've ever read. Props to Cross! Some times the truth hurts the most."
4,"Good story, Good author.","This book is a wonderful tribute to Kurt's life. Charles Cross' writing style makes you feel as though you were watching a movie. His descriptions reach points where you'd think they were best friends and the amount of detail leaves you wondering how he could know so much about someone who isn't even alive to ask anymore. Cross uses many quotes from the people in Kurt's life and fills you in from day one, starting with Kurt's parents before he was even born. I dislike the amount of names mentioned in the book however. Many characters are only name drops, which becomes confusing at times because you're not sure who is being spoken about. Other than the obsessive amount of names, the stories are fairly easy to follow. The author added some pictures about 200 pages in, from mostly Kurt's family that were very touching to look at. I thoroughly enjoy it, and do not regret buying it. I'd say it's definitely worth the money."
2,Restricted on the drug use,"Sorry for this small review but one thing that overwhelmed me is the constant talk about drugs. I was left with an empty feeling about the music and the role in Kurt's life. Nirvana are neglected (yes, i know there's another book!) like they weren't a huge part on his life. In every page there's drugs, drugs, drugs, so much that i got the impression that the writer hates Kurt after all for whatever good or bad reason!So, sorry but i didn't want to leave this book hating Kurt (and it almost did that). I play music so i know that Kurt is a better person that the cynical junkie that the book presents. Please pass on this one"
1,the lies are heart wrenching,"I don't claim to be a Kurt Cobain expert. Nobody is except for Kurt himself. His life will always be a mystery. This book,however, Describes events and thoughts that nobody in world could know in such detail. He couldnt know what he was thinking when nobody was around. In every paragraph the book contradicts what it said in the paragraph before that one. He lead people to believe the Cobains were happy. When Courtney said herself that he wrote unflattering letters about her. He told people he was gonna divorce her. I think the author should just stop writing forever if he won't even attempt to make it interesting. Hopefull this is his last fiction novel!"
1,Biased trash,"As the book starts out describing how beautiful Courtney Love is, you know right away that the book is trash.It gets worse.Everything Kurt says and writes is depicted as a sign of suicide. Courtney Love adds to this by stating how happy they were and how he could never seem content. Yet, interviewers state how happy and contented he had been toward the year of 93 and 94. That's ignored, however, as the author writes more about how selfish, arrogant, and contradictory Cobain is.It's pure trash. I also know I'd hate it if when I die, people go through my diary. I know I've written 10x worse things than Cobain did in my journals."
5,A compelling insight on a music legend.,"Although I don't read very much, books like these give me an urge to read more. Kurt Cobain has always been one of my favourite rock stars ever, and this book gives so much info about his life, that you feel like you know him when you've finished reading it.The book basically talks about his messed up childhood, how Nirvana were formed, the stages that spanned his sadly shortlived career, and mostly about his serious heroin addiction. It practically talks about every event that happened in Kurt's life, even down to when he commited suicide. I'd recommend this book to every Nirvana and Kurt fan, or anyone who's even the least bit interested in him. Believe me, you won't be disappointed."
3,So much fire...,"I've read the book for myself and I think it's pretty good. But, after reading the other remarks from other readers, I can see that there's a lot of heated remarks over this book. As far as I'm concerned, I've learned enough about Kurt, that I want to be a musician myself. It's helped me with my life and if you hate it for the fact that it doesn't portray him right, think about this: HAS ANY BIOGRAPHY ON ANYONE BEEN ACURATE?!?!?! I DON'T THINK SO!! If it's not right because of Love and Cross, then OH WELL!! He's gone now and no one will know the god-honest truth about him and what he would've done if he lived on.The price of fame..."
4,Kurt Cobain,"This was a very informative and interesting biography about Kurt Cobain. Since I live in the Pacific NW and am familiar with Aberdeen, Olympia and Seattle I felt very connected to things said about these locations and felt like I was there while reading this book. Kurts death/suicide was a great loss to the music community. After reading this book it makes me curious of how Courtney and Francis are doing now. It would have been nice to have more photos."
4,"very interesting, sad and addictive","This book is simply an intriguing story of a troubled guy. I am not a HUGE Nirvana fan, yet i have always been interested in Cobain's life and how Nirvana came to be. I definitly recommend this book for fans of his work but i also recommend it to those who are looking for a captivating story of someone who has lived thru so much pain. Reading this book creates mixed feelings for Cobain. At some points you feel incredibly sorry for him; at others you look down on him and then there are moments where you admire him for being able to create the music that made him famous. This book is definitley worth the time and money."
5,"Great book, great service",The product was in great condition and shipped promptly within the suggested time frame. I would definitely recommend this seller.
1,-MORALLY WRONG-,"Fact of the matter is, I don't understand how all you REAL Nirvana fans out there could even possible agree with this book that Cross wrote. It reveals Kurt Cobain's most private thoughts, his heart! I just know that what I write in my diary, is not something that I'd like to share with the world. Even after I die. I think it is completely disrespectful to publish his diary. I, for one, will not read the book. Let the man rest in peace. It's just plain dumb, and I can't understand why people would even consider buying the book! Have none of you any respect for the legend himself? I'm saying, if you really are a Cobain/Nirvana fan, don't read the book! It's rude! You will again hear the common quite, ""Curiosity killed the cat"". Be cool, don't get too much involved into his once personal life."
5,Amazing.,"I hate reading but I read this book in 3 days, I could not put it down it's that good. I think I'm the second coming of Kurt, so much in common it's scary. But read this book!"
3,"Good, but not great...","I've been a nirvana fan for about 4 years now and before I read this book I thought I knew everything about Kurt Cobain, but this book really gives the little details on his life I didn't know about.It wasn't as good as I thought it would be though. It definetly sounded like the author had made some stuff up when he was talking about how Kurt killed himself-no one knew all the details about what Kurt was thinking or what he was doing.The author focuses more about the sex life of Kurt Cobain rather then what a good biography should include. Other then that, it was a pretty good book, but not a really good biography."
5,Popstar to Nirvana junkie,"I have a story behind this book. My brother had two copies of nevermind that he no longer listened to, and one day I took out the normal backstreet boys (I know I know, keep reading) and popped it in. Amazing. But then I found myself singing along ""likes to sing along to our pretty songs"" and I decided that I wanted to find out more instead of being like the guy in the song that doesn't understand. While browsing through a book store I found Heavier Than Heaven when I recognized Kurt's face on the cover. I sat down in the middle of the store and started to read the book until someone asked me to leave. I soon bought myself a copy. It is probably the best biography I have ever read. I am still young, but I read. This book has got me wanting to read more, why so many people think that Courtney killed Kurt, or it was someone in the band, I just want to know everything. This was a great book and I recomend it to anyone who knows how to read."
1,Cross cashes In on Nirvana Tragedy,A suck up book if ever ne was. Cross said nothing to displease Courtney Love and got a big advance and royalties for selling out his editorial post. Now I am convinced the Rocket (Crosses Seattle alternative paper) has no street cred. He makes Kurt look bad and makes Courtney look good so how can we trust the other cute stories? TW
1,Pulling the wool,"To anyone who was a fan or has followed the story of Kurt Cobain it is obvious that this book is full of false information. The last half of this book is the, WHO DOES IT SERVE, spin control version of what happened. This information is obviously without any doubt completely disrespectful to Kurt Cobain as an artist,public figure and human being. I would ask that you question ever fact in this book and examine the true nature of how it was written and why."
1,Avoid / boycott,"I was so angry I burnt the book. Cross has copied from Michael Azerrad biography, only had turned everything just as his friend Courtney wanted. A mean attempt to raise money and attention. Absolutely not accurate. Most everything in the book and all the end is made out of lies. One star rating is even too much. A true Nirvana fan should avoid purchasing this book and should boycott this book whenever he can."
2,just buy Come as You Are,"when i started this book i had just finished Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana, and had to stop reading Heavier then Heaven. from the first chapter it just made me mad. The author goes on and on about how kurt was feeling at age 3 when, as much as i could tell, the guy never even talked to kurt cobain. i also got the feeling that the author was bringing out the worst side of cobain's personality and making him seem like some sort of hypocritical whiner. i think the book is a waste of time and money. just buy come as you are instead. the one good thing i can say about this book is that there are a lot of details."
1,The end ruins the integrity,This book really is a peice of [junk] in many respects. Although it is very detailed and reaserched it is obvious that he didnt recheck some of the facts that he got from Courtney. And then the END when he made up the last day of his life down to every detail as if he knew exactly what happened when no one really knows. This book REALLY gives you the wrong ideas as the guy before me said so DONT read it unless you know all of the true facts about Kurt and just want some entertainment
1,Better being dead than married to Courtney,"Petty words from the wife. Like reading Monica's book about Bill. There is some truth, but it is so overwhelmed by the sleezy manipulation of Courtney it becomes worthless to read. Other books are far more informative about Kurt. This is trash. An honest view on Kurt is by Christopher Sandford"
1,A disgusting work of fiction.,"Not one page of this unwarranted collection of inked pages has the validity or the sophistication to be anywhere near the non-fiction section. It is apparent that this author has been clearly manipulated the same way that can be done in regards to other forms of media... This ""book"" is a truly disgusting collaboration of illegitimate events and ""facts"" that Cross was eagerly fed and which Cross also od'ed on. I am quite shocked to read something so full of impersonal spins and lies that could be intertwined with biography territory. It takes a very daring and deceitfully clever person to construct certain shams such as feeding well-known and documented lies to an author. The only thing that was clear to me by the end of this ""book"" was that the scene of the crime screams that there was successful research done by the killer to make it look like a suicide, which also bolsters my deep suspicions of a certain widow."
1,book is absolute lies,the book is absolute lies and slander and was written to only give courtney's side of what she wants people to believe
4,Good Information but supports Courtney Love,"In my opinion, this book has good biographical information but has wrong information concerning Kurt's death. Cross talks about Kurt based on information from Courtney Love, a contradictory liar and [woman]. ... Eldon Hoke was offered [money]to kill Kurt Cobain by Courtney Love. There are many inconsistencies and contradictions in the whole case."
5,Very informative,"A quick read that is hard to put down. You will look at Nirvana's music through a whole new light after reading this book, and it will give you an entirely new outlook on Kurt Cobain. Love him, hate him, he is either way a fascinating study in hedonism."
5,Awesome videos!,"Awesome videos! My 3 year old LOVES these movies. If he could, he would watch them all day! Sid is fun and even though he might not completely understand all of the science, I love that he is beginning to hear how things work."
5,Bravo for Soprano's Cookbook,This book has a plethora of recipes that I am sure the soprano family and many of their counterparts enjoy on a regular basis. I know that I do.
2,You've gotta be kidding me!,"Tony Soprano, if he were real, would either fall over laughing or have a panic attack if he learned some publishing-house nitwits were capitalizing his name for some lame cookbook. The recipes are standard Italian fare with a few jazzed up with recent trends, but nothing you'd go out of your way to prepare for guests. This thing ranks right up there with the Forrest Gump cookbook: a rather uncreative way to milk even more money from a popular franchise. And we thought the over-the-top product placements on the show were bad enough! Save yourself the trouble, buy a ""regular"" cookbook with better (if less hip) recipes and save your money for Sopranos DVDs."
5,Fantastically Delishious,I have bought this book a few years ago and have made several recipies from the book. Everything I have cooked using the recipes has came out super delishious. I have cooked for guests as well and they have thought I had bought the food from a resturant when I have in fact cooked it myself! Absolutly delishous!!! Gotta have this book in your Kitchen!
5,Buy This Book,"This book has tons of yummy recipes. I've already made several dinners and they are really good. There is tons of fun character info too. My only warning is don't cook this stuff too often it's really good, but really fattening."
3,"A good start, but the executions went a lot better on the show","This book is not for the novice. The recipes in the book are, at their core, sound. However, one should be cautious when following some of their directions. Almost all of the recipes require modifications to some degree. Part of it is commom sense, part is personal taste (that's if you like your chicken to have the consistency of shoe leather; seriously, an hour and a half for baked chicken?).That said, the recipes themselves are fantastic. I've happily stuffed my face with Ziti al Forno, Minestra, Eggs in Purgatory, and Zeppole (donuts)."
5,The Best Basic Italian Cookbook Ever!,"The Sopranos Family Cookbook is authentic! Having grown up in an Italian family I know first hand that these are the dishes that are served as basic fare and Artie Bucco's approach is as authentic as it gets. Every recipe is made exactly the way my grandmothers made them and taste exactly like theirs, too.My husband and I haven't even put this book on the bookshelves with the other cookbooks - we keep in out on the coffee table for quick and easy access. We use it more than any other cookbook and we're not tired of it yet. It's genuine comfort food, both for the body and the spirit.If you want authentic Italian fare on your table, this is the book to get. Nothing too fancy - just good, basic family style meals that have been around for generations.There is also good fun reading in here. Get it - you'll enjoy it!"
2,Great Book,"Lots of great recipes and some funny stuff too! Obviously not for anyone who fancies themselves ""the next great chef"" or has delusions of granduer concerning their culinary skills. Not even for people who remember how their mom or grandmother USED TO make food. Just a good fun book for Soprano's fans that might wanna throw some food on the stoveThe only issue I had with this book was the fact that a section of pages repeated and some pages were not there. Obviously a pressing issue, would be classified as defective or a second.Otherwise the book was great... but it only deserves a 2 since it's not a complete book.Seller offered to replace with a book of slightly lesser quality, but I didn't feel it was worth the effort. more than enough recipes to make the book worthwhile"
5,Absolutely Loved It!,Love the book! Looking forward to eating at Artie Bucco's restaurant the next time I'm in town! Would greatly recommend this cookbook to all food enthusiasts of Italian cuisine!
5,Best cook book,"My boyfriend is Italian and made me buy this book to learn how cook real Italian dishes, everything I made from the book turned out amazing .... One of the best cook books I own."
5,This Italian loves this cookbook!,"While I have never even watched a full episode of The Sopranos show, and while I do not condone anything that plays up Italians as dirty rotten crooks, I have to say that I do love this cookbook. If you are a Sopranos fan, you will like how the cookbook actually reads like an interesting book, with antecdotes from the Sopranos characters. If you want authentic Italian recipes, like those my grandparents made, you will enjoy using this cookbook. I am 100% Italian and my mother (the best cook on Earth) says that these recipes are pretty authentic, so there you have it. Don't mess with Mama. :) She likes it so much that she bought all three of us kids a copy! So far every recipe I have tried has come out great (including the pignoli cookies, which are Dad's favorite), and most are really easy and often written to be convenient to make too. Love this book!"
4,Essential Soprano collectable and great cookbook.,"This cookbook will give you step-by-step directions to eating Soprano style (try Carm's Ziti or the Sunday Gravy!), and it's also packed with pictures and interviews with cast memember. The interviews and text can be a little corny at times, but the recipes are solid italian food at it's best."
5,Delicious,"Everything is this book is so good, you want to make it all in one day. It brings back the old days when my grandmother was alive and the family got together for holiday dinners."
3,"Tongue in cheek, food in mouth","I bought this book because I was a latecomer to the TV series. Having watched (almost) the entire series in a couple of weeks, I was addicted to the constant mentions and depictions of food. I come from an Italian background but many of the dishes are foreign to me as they seem more Americanised (manicotti, for one). I was intrigued to read the book and cook up some of the recipes. So far, I've read the book but still haven't taken it into the kitchen. That'll happen soon enough.Meanwhile, I found the book very tongue in cheek, almost like a caricature of the series with the characters pretending to be their onscreen personas. It's amusing, entertaining and a must-read for Sopranos fans. It's just a little escapism, nothing particularly substantial. Grab it!"
2,Disappointed with this Cookbook,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of my copy of the cookbook. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed with it once it arrived. Overall it seemed very contrived and didn't, in my opinion, capture the Sopranos style as I had hoped. If you want a real mafia cookbook, I would recommend the Wiseguy's Cookbook by Henry Hill. It's true to its name. Written by a former wiseguy and it captures the feel of what I expected from the Sopranos cookbook."
3,"Roasted sausages, potatoes and onions",Are you kidding!!! 450degrees for 45 to 75 minutes will turn these to charcoal! Is there a misprint here?
5,YogaMama,"Forgot to review this book. I've enjoyed the recipies, especially they use old-style, true Italian cooking. The recipe for spaghetti sauce is very good!"
