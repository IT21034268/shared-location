5,Absolutely Love It!,Works wonderful! Thank you for prompt shipping....I was amazed when I first use this brush..amazing at what a difference it makes...definitely will recommend to others.
5,Best Grill Scraper Around,"No more brass leavings on the grill. This is one of the best inventions for the grill, easily replaceable scrubbers from the grocery store and nice and sturdy. Great product."
1,Buyer beware! This is NOT the real deal.,"This is NOT the real tool that Cook's Illustrated reviewed. The real tool is called Grill Wizard China brush found at grillwizard[dot]com. I am not affiliated with the company in any way. I found this out after searching for the tool on Amazon and discovering this was fake. The real tool has a wooden handle.NOTE: Grill Wizard now has a 2009 Z-brush, which has a 2"" drop for Weber 22.5"" charcoal kettle grills, because the grill grate is recessed inside the grill.Grill Wizard has posted a product demo on YouTube at [...]. Although the video is homemade, it is definitely informative, and dare I say, entertaining."
1,Not the Real Thing,"If it costs less than $25 or so for the basic tool and it doesn't have a wooden handle, it's not the original tool as designed & manufactured by R.G. Mfg. in Cupertino CA. Check out this site if you want the actual product. Buy this only if you want to ""save"" money but then buy a new one when it wears out."
4,"Read about Electronic Paper - the ""Monitor"" of the Future",A good book for discovering about the future directions of computer science and the things which will be coming our way some day soon from research done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Gershenfeld writes very good explanations for some very advanced research topics and their future uses. Covers a revolutionary invention known as electrophoretic paper for making an electronic book which looks exactly like a book but whose pages have the properties of a computer monitor.
2,Not what I expected,The style of writing and the author's extraneous comments about left field topics was off putting. I wonder whether folks who liked it simply ignored its shortcomings.
4,Recommended reading for the intelligent and curious.,"This is a good test of yourself. Grab the book, read it, and see how far your interest and level of comprehension will take you. If you arrive at p.213 craving for more, your're all set to appreciate and enjoy what technology is able to offer in the next Century. On the other hand if you're already yawning at p.21 where the idea of elctronic ink is discussed, then you will be just about one-tenth ready for the world of tomorrow... Anyway this title is highly recommended for any intelligent citizen in the modern world. Hope Neil Gershenfeld will find time to keep up his writing of expository books."
1,cubana,"The quality of the DVD was so poor that we could not watch it. In fact, my husband threw it away!"
3,el signo de la muerta,"I recentlt purchased the film ""El Signo De La Muerta"".The product information stated that this film was in Spanish with English subs and also dubbed.Well,it was neither.The picture was nice,but as I don't understand Spanish,the whole movie was a guessing game.I wish someone would correct the info.Had I known this film was only in Spanish,I wouldn't have ordered it.Not to be a cynic,but maybe this was the reason?"
2,Not good for cover letters,"The cover letter suggestions is an over-kill for the average job search. One example is seven paragraphs long. Other resume references suggest get to the point and be done with it in no more than five paragraphs. I have three resume books, 202 Great Resumes is never useful to me."
2,not great,"I thought this book would be a good reference to see great styles and get ideas but was disappointed. I don't know what they based their career field selections on but of the 1000s of jobs, 202 isn't that many. Stylistically, most of the examples seem to go against the advice of other resume books and were not impressive. I did find a few helpful ideas from 2 or 3 of the resumes and it helped somewhat just to read through that many butit would be better for someone whose career choice happens to be in the book and the example they have is for someone at the same level."
2,Would not recommend ...,These shirts are a great price. My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically. Mostly shrunk in length. While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time .. they have now become too short for him. I followed the instructions for washing also...
1,Terrible,"These may be the worst quality figures that Neca has ever produced. After purchasing the Neca Ninja Turtle figures and being thoroughly impressed with the quality, sculpt, etc. I thought I would give these a try... Terrible mistake. Not only are the Neca Resevoir Dogs as fragile as they come, they are terribly designed as well. I could not get them to stand up properly even on their stands. The sculpting is okay, but the paint on these was sloppy at best. These are definitely not worth the price, I would not recommend these to anyone except die-hard Tarantino fans who are willing to spend the time to make these things work.Awful..."
4,Good for high schoolers and up,"If you're willing to really THINK about what's being said in each cartoon, and your students are motivated to use the words presented as vocabulary for each page, this can be a GREAT way to jump start a lesson. I made transparencies and showed these at the beginning of weekly classes for my teenage students. They helped new words to stick. I then would add a little speaking activity or something to go with each one to further the absorption.For younger children, who need lots of activities and hands on learning, try Flip Flop Spanish, which comes with a CD!Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
4,Spanish A La Cartoon,"`Spanish a la Cartoon' is an excellent book for those new to reading Spanish. This book presents simple written Spanish in a fun format. Each page has a single cartoon (not a cartoon strip) like the kind found in newspapers with a Spanish dialogue or phrase underneath. There is then a key word section that translates the main words into English, before the complete phrase is translated into everyday English at the bottom. The cartoons are usually quite humorous and are a great visual way to start reading Spanish. There is also a Spanish-English glossary at the back. If you like this I'd recommend `Oxford Spanish Cartoon-Strip' which follows a similar format but is slightly more advanced due to the strip aspect and a bit more of a narrative to follow.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,An excellent book with one fatal flaw,"This book is an excellent introduction to Notification Services -- much, much better than what's available in Books Online or on the web. It's well-written, well-organized, and terse. A great text for someone just getting their feet wet.However, it has a fatal flaw that knocks it down from 5 to 4 stars: This book has no index. I'm incredibly disappointed by this. It means that this book, once read, will never be picked up again -- if I can't find information quickly enough, I won't bother. An index is key to a good tech book, but apparently Rational Press missed that memo.Great book, but buyer beware if you need something you can use as a reference later on down the road..."
5,Roomy Recipe Box,"I can't say enough about these recipe boxes. I purchased 2 of them at the time and I love them. I am an avid cook and baker. I found myself running out of room in ordinary recipe boxes due to the fact that I write my own recipes. These recipe boxes have a lot of room and go lovely with a dark accented kitchen. The rolling top works well enough that even my children can open them, and the boxes themselves are sturdy enough they're not going to break the next day. Most recipe boxes you find now a days are made of plastic or cardboard. These recipe boxes on the other hand will last a while."
3,Short Stories...Loosely Connected,"""Small Pieces Loosely Joined"" is one of the books that I was really excited to read. Great subject. Great author. And sure enough, within each chapter, I has some really thoughtful moments. But on balance--and maybe this was intentional--the overall connection just seemed missing (as if the chapters were loosely joined...). As a set of short stories, the chapters are provacative. Overall though it left me wanting a bit more. A good book for a slow afternoon...and hey, there's really nothing wrong with that."
1,I didn't get it.,"I did not find this book insightful or useful. I returned it to Amazon and I would wait until more reviews are posted before buying it. I'm not a ""web-head"" but I either didn't get or don't buy what the author is saying. Sorry."
5,A survey of Internet language & experience,"Small Pieces Loosely Joined is a survey of Internet language, experience, and relationships between reality and Web sites makes for intriguing discussions of media and it's influence on human achievement. Weinberger argues the web is more than a worldwide link: it is also a public forum with world contributors and offers the potential for lives to be lived in another realm."
1,low information content,"Not much worth reading here if you've been paying attention to (or more so, working in) web development over the past 5-10 years."
5,Useful.,"This quirky book is fascinating in its probe of organization: of information, of thought, of our lives. What could have been dry commentary held my attention because it was injected with the human experience throughout.I needed to read the book to help me think through some ""tagging"" issues in a project. I got the help, and more."
5,Smart and Sassy!,"If you love the tough talking, wise cracking female newspaper reporter types of '30's B movies; don't miss Glenda Farrell as Torchy Blane.No one does it better! With Barton MacLane as her long suffering police detective boy friend;watching these two fine actors work together is a joy. Fortunately they star in 7 of the 9 episodes presented in this set. A blonde,curly haired Jane Wyman trys her best in Torchy Blane- Playing with Dynamite, but there just isn't the 'heart' in her character that came so naturally to Farrell. The duo of Lola Lane and Paul Kelly in Torchy Blane in Panama, are likewise less than endearing. Plots are interchangeable, with plenty of comedic 'shtick' thrown in...Have Fun!"
4,More Fun Than I Thought It Would Be,"I wasn't familiar with Glenda Farrell, and never thought of Barton McClane as a love interest but it works. The one with Lola Lane and the one with Jane Wyman are less enjoyable because there's a chemistry between the real Torchy and the real Skipper that can't be ignored.This series is a real antidote to the substandard movies du jour. At this price, it was well worth the investment and I know the movies will be watched many times.I think, if Glenda tried, she could speak just a little faster and break the sound barrier."
5,Complete In Christ,John MacArthur once again illustrates for us why he is one of the best bible teachers in Christendom today. This book gets to the core of the false teachings out their and gives a strong case why so many Christians go seeking for something extra when Christ has made them complete already. Buy it you wont be disappointed.
3,gluten free on the go,"Gourmet it is not, however it is fast, easy and one of the very few shelf stable gluten free instant meals I have been able to find and they taste pretty decent for the price."
2,bad.,"I love Thai Kitchen Pad Thai (well not love, but it's pretty good for an instant meal) but this is far from bring good. the word is called ""bad"".yes. it is horrible. it lacks taste, or if there is, it's not good.i don't know how to explain it.... just tastes weird."
2,The Best of...?,"The title ""Best of..."" reminds me of something cheezy in the audio world, but in this case as well as this book. I can't believe Helmut Newton would agree to publish this kind of quality (or lack of). This book looks like earlier works that were hacked from the cut or an porfolio deemed unworthy for professional world. Sorry, ""The Best of..."" just isn't."
5,A VALUABLE AND COMPACT REFERENCE WORK...,"This is an excellent compendium of the law on corrections and prisoners' rights. It is certainly a book that no criminal law practitioner should be without, whether the practitioner be a member of the defense bar, the prosecution, or the judiciary. It should also be a must read for anyone working in the field of criminal justice.The book covers a broad range of topics. It gives an excellent analysis of the sentencing process, as well as a terrific overview of plea bargaining. It discusses the status of pretrial detainers and convicted offenders in terms of loss of their respective rights. The author also addresses the issue of incarceration, as well as prisoners' rights and responsibilities. The book goes on to discuss the role of parole and probation, as well as the restoration of offenders' rights, and the problems that offenders confront upon release. This book provides a concise and worthwhile analysis of all these issues and is well worth having."
3,Mediocre sound,"Although I'm no stickler for the latest digital wizardry, the sound is what hurts thess performances, not the conducting, or even the somewhat hurley-burley orchestra. The Sinfonia is a major work, and deserves a wider audience; the orchestral versions of the Danzas are an interesting alternative to the *excellent* piano version on Naxos (Jordi Maso); and the Ritmos will be new to most listeners. But...this CD has the unfortunate characteristic problems with treble common to many early CDs (though this recording is by no means old). The violins get quite shrill at times, especially in loud passages. I'd enthusiastically recommend the Lopez-Cobos reading of the Sinfonia and Danzas, but unfortunately his CD also has a surprisingly tepid version of Iberia. The Naxos CD is a keeper - but it could have been so much better."
4,The Deadly Sins of Employee Retention,There were many things in the book I was already aware of but it offered some new insights as well. It was short and a quick read which I appreciate when trying to read business related materials.
5,Good Book,"This is a superb book for some one who is just starting to investigate the subject of employee retention. It is short, easy to understand, and flows well. The information that is provided is practical and timely. A quick read on the subject of employee retention for those who do not have a lot of time to find, read, and analyze the multitude of books available on the subject."
3,Nothing new but a good read,The information is nothing new. Treat your new employees well and they will feel at home.
5,Great read,This is one of the best book on the symbol of the far leftism in America. It reveals the truth like no other book. I enjoyed reading this because it helped me understand the Michael Moore phenomenon and the lies behind this fat guy who thinks he is the only man who sees stuff the right way. Michael Moore is a clueless shameful American.
4,The truth will always come out even though it might take awhile,"In this book the authors go behind the facade of Michael Moore, the principal propagandist for the Democratic Party, to hold his lies and deceptions up against the light of factual reality. And, Moore comes out looking every bit the hypocritical, money-crazed, by-any-means-necessary, socialist that he is; and it's about about time he got his due in this regard. What I find most interesting is how many people could end up believing anything thing he says or puts on film??? It just goes to illustrate that man's capacity for self deception, that which has been present since we crawled out of the primordial swamp, is still with us, alive and well."
4,"An excellent ""survival horror"" title","The original Dino Crisis was a relatively fun game. Basically Resident Evil with dinosaurs. This sequel hit a stride for the series with more original gameplay. The player can purchase weapon upgrades, and has effectively almost unlimited ammo, making for a much more action heavy experience than the Resident Evil games, while still retaining the ""adventure"" feel of that series. The graphics were noticeably upgraded too, although they're not going to be a technical marvel by 2005 standards.It's basically Jurasic Park, done as an action/adventure/survival horror game by Capcom...which is a very good thing.You'll want a decent control pad (like Logitech or Microsoft) to play this PC version."
5,Different and Exciting,I thoroughly enjoyed to content of this book and I'm looking forward to the sequel.
4,Smooth stories of rough water.,"I have never known much about life at sea. I got this book because it was in the series of good collections by Clint Willis. I figured it would probably not be as good as his others, but I was pleasantly surprised. I liked as much if not more. Stories ranging between the plights of sea-men caught in huge storms to single individuals trapped in the solitude of an open sea. These stories are from today as well as from the distant past. If you're intrigued by the sea but don't have much knowledge of the world it creates, take a look at this book. It's wonderfully diverse and highly adventurous."
5,Awsome,Have u watched the starwars movies and longed to be able to play the great music of John Williams? Then this is the song book for u. This book has the best starwars songs and teaches u how to play them.
3,Could be better!,I really thought it would be a good book.I thought it would talk about stuff we didn't know about Han Solo.If you have seen the star wars trilogy the whole book is old news.Plus the idea of the book being a interview is lame. It would be a better cassette then a book. The only way you know what's happening is through what they say.If you have seen the trilogy don't read it.If you haven't and want to read it don't except to much. I would give it less stars but that would be to mean.
2,Goodbye Tsugumi,"A disappointing book from an author whom I came to love after reading Kitchen and N.P.: A Novel. Goodbye Tsugumi is told in a simple way, yet Yoshimoto's story is lacking in elegance, which then creates a sophomoric feeling.Much of the writing comes off as a teenager recollecting the past with a friend. This might work if there was something more to be gained from the telling the story but there is not. Reading this book is like unraveling a simple square knot,once it is released there is nothing there."
3,A Good Author Loses Something in Translation,"I have previously enjoyed Banana Yoshimoto's works, especially ""Kitchen"" and ""Lizard"" and was looking forward to ""Goodbye Tsugumi"". Unfortunately, I feel it loses something in Michael Emmerich's translation.It's the prose. Yoshimoto's gift is in her prose and the way it lightly flows throughout her novels. But Emmerich's translation often doesn't flow, and it really made this novel less enjoyable. This is not to say that it's a bad novel, but with this translation, at least, it doesn't read as a great novel.I'd suggest reading one of Yoshimoto's other works."
4,Searching For A Simile,"I've been trying all day to come up with a simile to describe the neat, simple elegance of Banana Yoshimoto's writing, and I think I've finally found one!It's like reading out of a bento box."
4,Another great one from the master storyteller!,"I have read all of Banana Yoshimoto's novels. She is a rare talent and a master storyteller. I'd looked forward to reading another one of her gems, and I couldn't wait to read Goodbye Tsugumi.This is the story of Maria, a young woman who has always resented her cousin, Tsugumi. Tsugumi has an unidentified disease and she will die young, which is why her family satisfies her every need -- thus turning Tsugumi into a rude and selfish person. But Maria discovers that there's more about her cousin than meets the eye. There are some great developments in the novel.Yoshimoto, like in her previous novels, uses magical realism in a quite subtle way. I wish I could read her novels in Japanese, for I'd love to read the novels in Yoshimoto's language. I enjoyed reading Goodbye Tusugumi and I highly recommend it."
1,Goodbye and Good Riddance,"I really wanted to enjoy this book, but I found it tedious and uninspiring. The sooner Tsugumi left the better, I'm afraid."
3,Banana--split,"I read Yoshimoto's Kitchen, which I loved, and Amrita, and I could not get beyond page 20, and this fell somewhere in between. The story hinges on the relationship of Maria and her cousin, Tsugumi whose behavior becomes out of control, but apparently forgiven because of her chronic unnamed illness. Maria lives in a seaside inn with her mother, aunt, and cousins until her father brings mother and Maria to Tokyo. Maria moves back just for the summer, and eventually we get to Goodbye, Tsugumi. The plot was so-so, but the dialog hurt the most, often to the point where it felt jarring. I always like to give Yoshimoto's books a whirl, maybe it's because of that Banana as a first name. She is worth reading, so try her first novel, Kitchen, if you want a better sample."
3,Eh,"I guess this would be good for 12-14 year old girls who love to read. Tsugumi isn't the only brat. I found the narrator disturbingly cold. The prose, while it successfully imitated the diction of a teenage girl, wasn't something I wanted to endure. But for what it was doing, it was well done. Very lyrical descriptions of nature."
5,Good reproductions of Homer's work,I bought this calendar after 2012 was over just for the reproductions of Homer's works which I love. I paint in watercolors and learn so much from his paintings.
4,"A Nation takes Shape, 1789-1837","Cunliffe, British Born, takes a look at the formatives years in the United States History. He tries to show the key aspects that brought the people a sense of nation. All Cunliffe's writing revolves around questions of nationhood, national identity, national peculiarity, national culture, national iconography, national tradition. He sees the nationality riddles as they must properly be seen: as Ultimately intelligible only in a comparative context. Cunliffe has the advantage of being able to look at the United states from a distance without the usually egocentrism that most American authors have about our own history."
1,Poor quality & too repetitive,"All you see in the whole DVD are the same girls all over again. The same shooting, only in different order. I don't think that the producers earned their money right... DON'T BUY"
5,this latina gatas realy know how to move it,First time i hear the reggaeton music and it sounds kileer...the girls are another thing... all puertorican honeys dancing it like it should... i like the perreo to..
5,hot latina chicas... me encantaron.. y love them,I am a 20 years old latina girl living in florida and i loved the girls dancing and their tight bodies... also the reggaeton music is hot... good thing is coming here now...Waiting for volume 2....
5,nice ladies and reggaeton music is the best,"if puertorrican girls are all like the ones in the dvd, I definitely need to go to puerto rico"
1,pretentious and elitist,"This should be under the fiction section. Senor Tony's take on life in the glitzy resort town of san miguel de allende is self-serving, delusional and inaccurate. I won't even go into the lofty professorial tone he oozes like the stink off of ripe cheese. If you know nothing about Mexico, you'll love this book."
2,"Shallow, exploitive.","Mr Cohan elitism and rip-off of Peter Mayle's fine love of France and his experiences there, is a palid and shallow look at a small Mexican town that deserves better. All the book is, is a thinly (and shallow)disguised look at Mr Cohan himself. And any deeper I would not wish to read. Mr Cohan displays no real knowledge of Mexico or her people, nor does he display much love for this country which he dares to try to show us. As a Mexican I am disgusted with the book. As one who visits San Miguel regularly, I am shocked with Mr Cohan's vacuous take on such a multi-layered town. To learn more about Mexico, skip this book."
2,Self centered and not fulfilling,"I am going to San Miguel next week and got excited about reading this book, as I live in LA and the author lived here too and moved to San Miguel. I got hooked into reading it and must admit I finished it, but soon realized that it was a silly little book. There was virtually nothing about San Miguel and the characters about whom the author wrote were distant and seemingly figments of one's imagination. The dialogue was ridiculous. I'm not sure what the point of the book is, but it isn't enough to be a diary and certainly not even close to giving one a feeling of life in San Miguel de Allende. It pretends to be erudite literature and the author never lets you forget that he knows this person, and that person, etc. It is a boring, drolling piece of work that drags on, but at least the type was fairly large and it didn't take long to finish it."
3,Half as long would be twice as good.,"Author has a nice touch, however, half way through he seems to run out of much to say except reportage. Reports about fixing a centuries old house can be about as dull as being there. No duller. There are interesting reflections, along with descriptions of people and places in the first half of the book, making it worth the cost of the book and your time reading at least half of it."
2,Two thumbs down,I hosted a Book Club meeting for Cinco de Mayo and chose this book to go along with the theme. I didn't even make it half way because it didn't hold my interest. No one else in the club did either and so we skipped talking about the book at all.
3,on mexicn time,"Because of the political and social changes in the past few years, the book was a bit too ""sweet""; however i did enjoy it because it was so well writen. I wish Mexico were still like it is represented in this book. If one were thinking of going there to live it would be a good thing to read."
4,Entertaining,"Being a regular visitor to San Miguel I was delighted to see that it was the subject of a new book. I found it entertaining and generally consistent with my impression of the town and the kind of people an expatriate or traveler would meet there. The real joy of the town to me is in its eccentricities and beauty, and both of these were captured. Unlike some other reviewers I don't think it should be interpreted as a critique of Mexico and Mexicans but rather a loving memoir of someone who established a lifestyle in a wonderfully different culture.By the way, Tony Cohan and his wife Misako collaborated on another book, Mexicolor, which is a beautiful photographic study of Mexican design and folk art. Many of the pictures are from San Miguel."
2,I Wanted to Love This Book....,"I have travelled to Mexico three times, though not to San Miguel de Allende. I was truly excited by the prospect of reading this book as I have an ongoing fascination with Mexico and its culture. Unfortunately, Cohan's self-indulgent whining and tedious, repetitive prose style present themselves as tangible obstacles. I did, however, enjoy some of his vivid descriptions and the few glimpses of this town he provides that aren't obscured by his egotistical point of view."
3,Sometimes fiction is truer than reality,"I agree with those who have not been totally charmed by Mr. Cohan's book. For a much more rewarding reading experience concerning Mexico, check out David Lida's ""Travel Advisory"". It's short stories mainly about foreigners in Mexico that are much more insightful and fun than Mr. Cohan's slight book."
2,Read it Only if You Must,"If you love Mexico, as I do, or are moving down there, as I am, then, sure, read this book. But if you are after some good travel writing, look elsewhere. The author tries SO HARD to sound flowery, impressive, artsy and cultured that I frankly found it disgusting. He was always trying to impress the reader with his words rather than just tell his story. One example: ""Out here on the Mexican road, I have veered into the realm of casual anarchy, where the instruments of recourse may be worse than the problem that occasioned them."" Huh? Another example: ""The scene is Fellini, Jacques Tati--or Luis Bunuel."" If that describes a scene well for you, then maybe this book is for you! Personally, I found his prose very irritating."
4,I almost moved,"After reading Cohan, I was tempted to pack it in and move to the sleepy mountains of central Mexico. This is what Cohan and his wife did after decades battling the rat race of the American consumer lifestyle. Experiencing a mid-life crisis of sorts, Cohan (a novelist) and his wife (a painter) decided to forgo the conveniences of suburbia in favor of a different way of living. The simple life, they found, was elusive. That is until they took a risk, sold their home in the States, and moved to the 16th century hill town of San Miguel de Allende. On Mexican Time is Cohan's memoir of the move and his adjustment to life in Mexico. This book is worth reading if you are at all interested in Mexican culture, or simply in good writing. Readers beware: you may be tempted to move south of the border!"
2,Pretty and superficial,"Installing a bright blue baked enamel stove and a fire-engine red refrigerator may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this story about the restoration of an old house in the Mexican town of San Miguel de Allende is full of vivid images. What it lacks are character development, structure, and understanding of culture beyond the superficial. Cohan's descriptions of problems with the Mexican help are endless.... However, On Mexican Time is a quick read and easily consumed in an afternoon on the beach."
1,hardcopy = 0.01 but Kindle = 9.98 this is what I hate about kindles,"I'd like to read this on my kindle, and I might consider it, if the cost was even half what is listed used."
2,On Mexican Time,"As a longtime friend of both San Miguel and Provence, I must agree with the blurb that Cohan equates to Mayle...but only in terms of strong egos and weak apologies for peddling the innocence of their newly beloved countries. Cohan's sophomoric blather, more like assigned reading for High School Spanish 101 than the work of an aged Stanford author,is repetitive,tiringly repetitive and flowery, often self-contradictory and overly righteous...like so many other gringos who, Cortez-like, imagine to discover a virgin and proceed to gloat over its deflowering."
2,A Travel Book Pretending to be a Novel,"When I ordered this book I was hoping for either a factual travel book on San Miguel de Allende, or a novel, but not both. Unfortunately this book fills neither objective. I think his second book was better."
5,Relax and get a new perspective.,I read a little each night in bed just to remind myself that the things I stressed over all day really mean very little when you step back and look at them. Sometimes life goes a differant direction than you thought you wanted it to.That's not always bad. This is one of those books that remind you to just Breathe and it's all good.
5,Put me on the next plane to San Miguel,"I'm not normally an armchair traveler, but the colors on the book jacket lured me in. Once inside, Cohan's words took over, and I've been dreaming of Mexico ever since. Who wouldn't want to move to a small town, learn from the artists and expats there, and rebuild a house into your very own dream home? I've never physically been to San Miguel, but if I ever go, I'm sure I will instantly feel right at home thanks to this beautiful and exciting book book."
2,another yuppie house remodel,"I echo the sentiments of previous readers--too much shopping, remodeling, and too many gringos. Cohan and his wife escape L.A. so they can duplicate their acquisitiveness by buying and furnishing a house in Mexico. This is essentially an account of a 15-year visit to a nice, middle-aged couple's lovely vacation home. Made me want to join the Zapatistas."
5,Mary Robison should win the Pulitzer,"Mary Robison is arguably the best contemporary author. Her prose does not need to be propped up with stale metaphors and similies. Every word counts. Her style could be compared to Hemingway. This novel changed my life as a creative writer. Besides being well written, it is interesting, fresh, and funny. I also read her first novel, Oh!, which is well worth reading. It is also very funny and shows Robison's talent with dialogue."
2,Not much too enjoy here,"There are a few funny lines, but overall this book is not worth the time it takes to read it. I found it hard to understand what was even happening in each segment. I had to force myself to finish it, because I kept thinking surely it would get better. I'll spare you; it doesn't get better."
1,Why did I ever read this book?,"I don't remember how I first heard of this book, but I was suckered in by the other reviews appearing on Amazon. I don't have a clue as to what the others reviewers are talking about--the emperor is not wearing any clothes!!!There are a few funny lines so I don't mind giving it the one star."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read!,"Save your money. Save your time. I read close to a 100 books a year (I'm an English professor), but I don't usually write reviews. I decided to write this one as a warning. This book has nothing going for it. It contains clip upon clip of disjointed, pointless rants. It's absolutely unreadable. I would give it zero stars, except that's not an option."
4,It works!,"My husband has lived the 'heatbreak of psoriasis'for 6 years. Sir Scabby is his nickname. The only option the doctors have given is the light box but because he travels a lot, that is not an option for now. He has gotten relief with this solution and new skin is growing. We are holding our breath to see how much his condition will improve but the improvement so far warrants ordering this product.Denise EldonAgua Dulce, Ca."
4,This thing is huge!,"i actually thought this thing was going to be 15.4"" tall. it's enormous. i wanted it to carry around with me on a daily basis, carry my lunch, a book and my laptop, but it actually makes a really great overnight bag. lots of pocket space, nice look to it. a really nice deal for its price."
2,SoSO..,"It's bad.First, I want shave squre. but real shave is suck.second, if u want a clean, I lost color."
5,My favorite backpack!,"i dont know why i didnt review this when i got it! i originally bought it for school, its bigger than i expected but not i use it for everything, i love that only the top opens, i guess its because i used to spill my backpack a lot. ive even considered getting another colour too."
2,I actually asked for a gray one,"I ordered for a gray one but they send me a green one.The backpack looks fine though. However, it is too big for everyday use. Might wanna look for a smaller piece if you want to make everyday use of it.And The green color is not cool at all."
5,K-Drama Fans...You'll love this!,"All about Eve! I love this k-drama....It's so romantic! (sigh!) After watching this you'll wanna fall in love... I think this is even better than ""Stairway to Heaven"". This is the kind of k-drama that you'll watch over and over again... I know I have...he he he... this love story is so sweet!! I gaurantee that you'll love just as much as I do! It has a nice story with jus enough drama... For all you first time buyers of K-dramas!! This movie is a ""must see""!"
2,NOT WORTH IT,"Korean shows have many talented actors and actresses who really know how to act. not in this series. the lead actor has this blank stair on his face with no emotion and the lead actress either smiles too much or cries too much. the story line is unreal at time and the music is forgetable. if you want a good series to watch , go for stairway to heaven, sad love story, winter sonata, love letters, phoenix and hotelier. if you want sword fighting Damo is a great series to buy."
4,DJP thong,The're gorgeous but they don't feel very secure. Slipped off the heelarea a couple of times!
2,Pliner Fiba Thong,"Be aware that the inside part of thong is missing. In other words, the top panel of the sandal does not span the foot totally. I thought it looked odd and isn't apparent from the pictures. Also, the stiffness of the leather on the panel dug into the top of my toes."
5,Best Exfoliant Money Can Buy,"This is the best exfoliant product one can buy. It's sold by dermatologists at a higher price. It leaves skin very smooth, and there are no large beads that remain behind. The gel washes away cleanly. I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about good skin care."
4,The Image is Beautiful,"A wonderfully illustrated compilation of interesting photography. Decent. Somewhat reminds one of G. Parks' work (some does appear here). One does not have to be a photographer to appreciate this book. Explosion of creative expressions. Contemporary photography, --indeed!"
3,beautifully written,"I liked a lot of things about this book:it was beautifully writtenthe world building was extensivethe customs of different places which the MC visits were well thought out and explained-my favorite place was the country with two types of governments and the idea of stealing being accepted as a society norm was intriguingAlso loved all of the scenes in the forests, especially ZolloccoI just had one issue with the book and that was its length. After reading 3/4 of the book, the remaining length seemed exhaustiveThe book makes us think about what we're doing to our world today-if only there was a Zollocco here who'd fight back!"
2,Riiiiiiiiiiiiight,"I don't get it, really. Sometimes Jude Deveraux comes up with these amazing male characters that just take your breath away...then she comes up with characters like Devon. What redeeming quality did he have?? Sure, he saves her and he's sweet to her at first, but then she's beautiful and all of a sudden he feels the need to treat her like she's the lowest bit of scum on the bottom of the lake. PLUS he kisses that Corinne chick in front of her, when it's obvious that Linnet was repulsed by Cord when he kissed her. But of course, Jude's men always have to have their stupid revenge on the innocent woman that's in love with them.Ok, and then he leaves her after he gets what he wants (secks) from her the night in the woods?? UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. The guy made me sick.But oh well, the important thing is that Linnet ended up marrying him. Afterall, he DID sigh ""Ok, I'll marry you..."""
3,Sweet reading,"This is a sweet book ~~ not my favorite though. Linnett and Devon fought too much for my liking and Devon was just a little too perfect and arrogrant for me. However, it is an enjoyable reading and it definitely whiles away time when you're reading it!Linnett came over to the States from England after her father lost his business. Her family gets killed by Indians and she is captured. Devon rescues her and chaos follow those two for two years till a confrontation with the Indians led them back together.It's a very sweet book and a quick read. It's perfect for a summer reading!9-11-04"
1,They lost me when they said to buy low fat processed food!,This book does not advocate a truly healthy lifestyle! Go with Esselstyn instead... it makes a lot more sense fo ling-term recovery!
5,Should be given to every heart patient,"My husband had open heart surgery on Valentines Day. I knew I had to change the way I prepare meals. Butter, chocolate, and cream are my three favorite ingredients! I thought we were doomed to a lifetime of tasteless eating until I purchased this book. Everything I have tried is wonderful. All hospital dieticians should recommend this book to their patients."
5,Embarrass your friends and excite the postman!,"I loved this collection of pictures from the Perfect Couple book. If you can't find the book, this collection make a brilliant introduction. As they tear out easily, they can be sent to your friends as postcards, the back being already printed for such use.The usual sumptuous Bel Ami/Bruno Gmunder production standards apply, and the colours, quality and content and superb."
4,Astronauts Live,"This is great live rock/r&b that was hard to match before the British Invasion. Would of been a 5 except for the lack of orginals. This colection of two live ablums they released, will be a hit at most any party and killer for fans of early bar rock. Few if any bands from the early sixtys could [rock]like this. GET IT!!"
5,Yummy bisquits!,"I went camping on Lopez Island and stopped by this bakery...I noticed that they were selling this cookbook but since this was my first visit, I didn't buy it then. After I tasted the Ham and Cheese Bisquits, I regretted not going back to buy the book."
5,The Title Says It All,"Fantastic bakery cookbook from Holly B's on Lopez Island (in the San Juans). Holly's recipes turn the sublime into the religious, and her bakery is God's gift to Lopez Island. If you can get your hands on this buy it (Holly sells it at her bakery as well), your waistline is the only thing that will regret it. It doesn't get any better than this."
4,Don't Tell Mom I Work on the Rigs: She Thinks I'm a Piano Player in a Whorehouse,"A honest story about a boy who is growing up in a contrasting world.He ends up in the world of drilling for oil and shows in his stories the bleak and funny sides of this sub universe.A very readable book which tells about places and people that most people don't know exist, let alone visit.Written uncensored and straight forward although not for the faint of heart.I enjoyed it very much and it reminded me about my time in the oil.John van Ekris. Sydney Australia.The second book is called ""this is not a drill"" also very good."
4,One Mans Story,"This is OK. It is a bit light on, and I think that is the audience it is aimed at. Ligght reading. Sometimes humorous, most times not. Never enthralling."
4,A fun read,"Whilst this is not really too high in quality, it was a fun read which I enjoyed. It doesn't take long to become quite engrossed in the story."
2,Tastes disgusting,"I take a lot of chewable and the flavors can vary greatly. Unfortunately, this is about the worst tasting chewable I've tasted. I love taking my other chewable, even the iron chewable are far better than this. It has a weird sweet/metalic taste to it that I just about have to choke down and it sometimes sets my stomach on edge. I've made myself keep taking these due to needing to supplement my B vitamins, but I won't be buying these again. I've experienced no obvious benefit from these, but in the realm of supplements you don't always notice a difference even when blood tests say there is one. I haven't had my B levels taken recently to say if my levels have come up, but based on taste alone.....I won't be buying these again."
5,These are delicious!,"I probably shouldn't be writing a review since this is my first day taking this vitamin but I wanted to comment on the flavor. It tastes VERY good, reminds me of a Sweetarts candy. I can't imagine how anyone finds this flavor to be gross, I could eat these vitamins like candy. Not sure where all the flavor hate is coming from. I also haven't noticed any ill side effects from taking this. Also another note, this vendor ships you the SUGAR FREE version, even though the bottle on this page and description says otherwise, so if you have a problem with sugar free, don't take this."
1,you cant order it in california,i was going to buy it but i learned that you cant buy it in california and it jams so often
1,"M40? that's a US marine sniper rifle, this is a german SMG....","M40 is the United States marine Corps Designation for their Remington 700's which are chambered with 7.62mm NATO rounds. the MP40 SubMachine gun here is most certainly NOT an M40, thank you :)"
1,Worst gun ever!!!,It broke on the first day i got it.Double Eagle MP40 WWII Spring Airsoft Machine Gun Rifle Airsoft Gun
3,Pretend Nazi Weapons,I needed some MP40s for a film and found these. Don't know how well they actually fire but they're MP40s. They look like the real thing at a medium distance with a little touchup paint.
3,"Airsoft ""M40"" Review.","I bought this Airsoft Gun as a substitute untill I buy a new, much nicer, Airsoft Rifle. I was not very accurate, and the BB's tended to curve upward sharply. The stock is made of cheap plastic, and was unuseable for me. The sight, and the small plastic piece connecting it tended to fall of at inopertune times, so i had to seal it on to the gun. However the gun is very light, easy to handle, and has a large magizine capicity (32 Rounds)for the type of gun. It is also easy to cock, and is a nice replica of a MP40. It is a decent weapon, but should only be used for yard wars, or decoration, or the money saved to buy a nicer airsoft Gun."
4,Great fun for the money,"This is quite a lot of gun for your money. Just as powerful as my M-16 A1 airsoft rifle that I paid $100 for (which claims 347fps). From 10-20 feet away, it'll shoot right on the bullseye of my gel target all day long. Being only $15, it's all plastic and is light as a feather, be sure to use the folding stock as little as you can because mine is starting to break after a month. Looks very realistic, although the real MP40 didn't have those little notches across the top and i'm not sure why they were put on this gun. In short, the gun does what it's made to do (shoot!) very well."
4,Good Beginner Springer,"This is an excellent springer, even though its a single-shot. It feels realistic and is fullsize. It also has a nice easy fill clip. Only wish it had a realistic metal gloss painting on it and a cheap automatic version of it."
5,"Quick Shipping, Good Gun","I ordered this gun and it only came in three days! It says that it has 180 fps, but it actually has like 200 or 220. The accuracy is amazing.PROS: Good range, accuracy, hard plastic, big magCONS: Stock is cheap; falls off easily, pretty big, mag is put backwards, and that's it!Overall, it's a great gun. I highly reccomend this to anyone."
2,Caroline Wrey's complete curtain making course,"I was very disappointed in the content of the book. Not only were the styles out of date but the construction of the curtains was anything but professional. I am the owner of an upscale drapery workroom and I am always looking for books with great ideas, there were none in this book and frankly if I constructed any of my curtains in the manner in which she describes they would be returned by the designer and the client because of the poor quality."
5,An excellent resource for the designer or homeowner,"""Carolyn Wrey's Complete Curtain Making Course"" covers all of the basics and many of the extras of curtain making. The photographs are excellent and the text is extremely easy to follow and understand. This book is a must for anyone who is decorating a home, whether they are a homeowner or a professional decorator."
4,Almost but not quite enough for making my own,"I was looking for help in how to cut and manage drapery fabric when making curtains. This book has a couple of helpful ideas on the subject. I also wanted detailed instructions on how to make lined draperies. There are detailed instructions but not enough for me. I am a beginner sew'er (not even a seamstress!). The how to pictures weren't big enough to show alot of detail and I am left with a bunch of questions. I am keeping the book though because it does have some neat ideas on drapery styles (i.e., Italian stringing) and very good instructions on how to make pinch pleat drapes if ever I try to!"
2,Lesson # 1:Never judge a book by its cover,"A great disappointment. The relatively fashionable cover doesn't reflect the inside of the book. The window treatments shown in this book resemble one another and are old-fashioned and plain. An ""Absolute-Beginners"" type of book,but even so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know."
4,The Regular Nancy Drew Romance...With a More Intricate Plot,"Nancy Drew. You will find romance in almost ALL the books, including this one. The plots are sometimes impractical- but NOT this one! This is actually one of my fave Nan stories, in which fashion and malls are included- my kind of book! All in all, it's a fairly good read. I'd reccomend it."
4,Squirrels of the West,"This is a wonderful, easy-to-read book. I'm in charge of squirrels and squirrel information at the California Wildlife Center in the Los Angeles area, and found it to be a nice reference, although the book is small and doesn't go into much depth. My only disappointment when I received the book is that the title is a little misleading, as it also covers relatives of the squirrels such as chipmunks, marmots, and prairie dogs. But they are all adorable! I'm delighted that I have a copy of this book."
4,Great Local Recollections,"This is a great compilation of memories for anyone who grew up in Cambria Heights in the 1950s/1960s. From the stores on Linden Boulevard to the nuns at Sacred Heart School, to the kids in the neighborhood it will bring back memories of a time and place once enjoyed and long forgotten."
4,"Much better than Obsidian Butterfly, but a bit disappointing","I love Anita Blake but was bitterly disappointed in Obsidian Butterfly. ""NIC"" is a vast improvement but still has some disappointments....Richard returns (groan) with still more of his whinings (how the heck does he stay pack leader when he's such a wuss?), and the ardeur becomes a bore with more bedhopping. Anita is becoming a helpess nympho! Still she does return to her detective work and sinks her teeth in yet another mystery involving preternatural murders and meets a new pard of wereleopards, including Nimir-Raj Micah who is at least more interesting than Richard. The novel ends with an epic battle that's much more to fans of the first trilogy. Recommend for Anita Blake fans but let's hope Ms. Hamilton gets Anita back to her roots in future books."
4,Down Fall of Richard the Whinny Heart,"Many reviews have been written about this book. Some have been good and some bad, but over all in my own opinion I believe this book is quite good except for a few key issues that LKH still refuses to address. One, that Richard needs to die or in some fashion taken out of the picture for good. Micah, brings life back to the story, and even though he is not my first pick for a lifemate or soul mate for Anita, at least he's not conflicted about who or what he is. Anita Blake is a sassy, arrogant, insecure, butt-kicking, feminist, but I can deal with that, if LKH would get back on track and remember that she's a vampire hunter and master necrosmancer now, let's see her use it!!!"
5,Anita just gets better and better...,"I read this book in about 3 days. Which is pretty good. It means I was never anywhere without it. For probably the first time in my reading career, after I was done with the book, I picked it up and read it again! It's a breathless read: adventure, humor,horror and sex. Plenty of sex. Let's just say Anita has finally decided to ""open"" herself up to being part of a trimuvarte. But it may *not* end up being the three you think.The only real missing piece in the book is the lack of Edward, but I'm sure he'll show up soon. This is a strong book for the Vampire series and makes me hunger for the next one! Happy Reading!"
1,The VERY WORST of the Series!!!!!,"Okay I have read all of Ms. Hamilton's books and I was ready to give her the benefit of doubt. But this book is a stinker. She has gone so far off of what her characters were you can hardly regonize them.There is no plot and if just sex is what she was going for then she did achieve that.(...) What she has done to Jean Claude is in itself a crime. Also please what happened to the Anita we all knew?????Please do not buy this in hard cover and waste your money, if you must read it wait for the paperback.I believe this is the last book I will read unless by some miracle she can get out of her ""Anne Rice"" mode and write like Laurell K. Hamilton again."
2,I waited so long for THIS?,"I love the Anita Blake series, but this installment was just plain awful. Anita would decide to take some kind of action (usually saving one of her were-leopards), would take a step toward it, then detour for 50 pages to sleep with someone or wring her hands over her sexual morality or whom she might love, etc. For it to happen once is unfortunate; repeatedly is unforgiveable. Hamilton has never been the strongest writer in terms of grammar and style, but in the past she had a handle on plot and characterization. Over the past two or three books, she's abandoned plot more and more, and her characterizations, though powerful, simply can't carry a book. The publisher needs to seriously consider getting a stronger editor to rein in Hamilton before the series suffocates from egoistic bloat."
3,"Still enjoying, but can we get out of the bedroom a little?","I've kept up with the series from the time I first discovered them, and I find them truly wonderful, refreshing reads. But NIC was a bit disappointing for me. As much as sexy vamps and furries are great reading candy, I need a stronger balance of plot and character. This was a little more like Kiss of Shadows for me than any of the others. Basically, Anita is surrounded by droolworthy guys and keeps deciding who she's going to make love to. This didn't prevent me from reading the book in one night, and I still enjoyed it--but there's a lot less character depth being explored here. There's mostly more of what we've seen in other books. I still encourage fans to read it, but if you're new to the series, start with the first few books before diving in here. I look forward to the next Anita Blake book, but hope for a bit better than this."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I cannot believe the turn Hamilton has taken with this series. I started with Guilty Pleasures and found a fresh, new approach to vampires. Why could Anita not stay as a vampire executioner and necromancer? Why, oh why, did she have to get tangled up in ""Nima-Ra, Nima-Raj, etc. to the point where I cannot even keep up with storylines anymore, because I'm trying desperately to make sense out of lycanthropy rules. And what she's done to Richard and Jean-Claude -- well, I think this will be my last Anita Blake book, especially if Anita turns out to be a ""furry kitty"" in the future. I think Hamilton has truly messed up with her loyal Anita/Richard/Jean-Claude fans this time. If this book had been different, we could've forgiven Obsidian Butterfly and things could've gone sorta back to normal, but not now. I knew from the scene at the beginning with Anita/Richard/Jean-Claude that this book was doomed."
2,Anita the victim,"I was disappointed in the many fragmented plot lines that pulled Anita into too many directions and neglected an insightful/in depth conclusion for any of them. Anita's intelligence and insight seem to have departed in this novel with no central story that pulls it all together, leaving Anita, at the end, no more aware of what has happened to her than the reader."
1,Just Awful!,"The worst one yet. Anita Blake the character has been destroyed by her author. The first half of the book explores Anita's new and improved love life, with some of the worst erotic prose this side of a rejected Penthouse letter.Anita Blake the human with increasing powers is still the only individual in these books who can win a fight, solve a problem, rescue the kidnapped, feed the hungry, heal the sick, be the lupa, entice the males, win the day, blah, blah, blah. This wouldn't make a good comic book.If you really want to read this, buy it used, wait for the paperback, or borrow it from a library. Don't spend hardback money on this fourth rate pap.Laurell K. Hamilton is out of ideas. If this is the best she can do, she should retire the Anita Blake character."
5,Narcissus in Chains,The entire Anita Blake series is addictive. This book is the same. You just cannot put them down.
2,Disappointing to the Extreme,"I used to be a huge fan of the Anita Blake books and I used to sit around drooling for the next installment. Lately, however, I now sit around praying the next book won't be a further let-down. This book was MAYBE 20 pages of plot. Maybe. The rest? Anita jumping into to bed with whatever comes along that is even the slightest bit male. Jean-Claude was my all time favorite vampire and now I cringe whenever I see him show up because all he seems able to do is sit around and sigh over his losses. Now I love erotica but I like my erotica with a reason and with romance. There is no romance in these books anymore...I liked the twist at the end but it didn't make up for the previous 95% of the book which disappointed me greatly. I will give this series one more chance because I know how wonderful it could be but I am most certainly not buying the hardcover. I would suggest waiting as well. Go back and read the first seven books. They'll give you more satisfaction."
2,Umm - Not QUITE an Anita Sequel...more of a Merry Sequel,"Well - I have been reading the Anita Series for about 3 years now...and after reading the other 9 books I never thought I would dread reading the next one....I did. *sigh* I wouldn't say that my reaction was enough to turn me off buying the next book, but it was close. I was expecting a nice, good Anita book - with Necromancy, Killing, and good Vampire-Hunter action...instead I feel like I got a Sequel to Kiss of Shadows. (...)The only thing that I can think of is that LKH saw how well the Merry Gentry book was received and it just bled over to this series. (Pun intended :-> ).(...) I know that I myself enjoyed her ""suffering"" with her sexuality (or celibacy) and to see her abandon all that now....*sigh* ah well.Thank youME"
2,terribly disapointing,"read and reread the anita blake series and enjoyed the parallel universe of vampires, werecreatures and the complex rules of the world they populated. the eroticism in the early books was appropriate and acted as a counterpoint to the prime character motivation. concepts of responsibility for dependent beings, unexpected and progressively unfolding ""powers"" added to the enjoymenty of unfolding maturity of the prime character. however the present book appears focused more on pornographic titillation than on plot development or character enhancement. it may be that ms. hamilton has either decided to milk the dollar by reproducing pseudosenusual s\m scenes or has run out of non sexual themes for her novels. at any rate am incredibly disappointed at this offering."
1,"Too much pornography, not enough story","I have read all of the books in this series, and have found them to be fun and entertaining - until this one. Unfortunately, as this series has progressed, the emphasis on sex to the exclusion of all else has steadily increased to the point where it completely overwhelms every other aspect in this book at the expense of the integrity of the characters and the story - which may make for good pornography, but which does not make for a good Anita Blake mystery.LOL, the best thing about this book is the well-written and funny posts here slamming it. Nice to know there are so many people in the world who know the difference between quality and crap."
3,Disappointing after Obsidian Butterfly,"Obsidian Butterfly was without a doubt the best book in the Anita Blake series. Unfortunately, Narcissus in Chains made me not want to read any of the books anymore. I had no problem with the sex and S&M. I had a problem with the main character becoming something she originally despised. She always said she'd rather die than become anything less than human but she didn't. I loved this series until this book. After reading it, I didn't want to read another. Hamilton is a great writer but should have left Anita as she was."
2,I hope Laurell Hamilton reads these reviews,"Like many of the readers reviewing this book, I eagerly looked forward to reading the next Anita Blake installment and immediately pre-ordered the book last summer. What a disappointment. This isn't the Anita Blake we've come to know. I absolutely believe that a character needs to change to keep a series fresh, but in this case Anita's gone from being an interesting in-charge woman to some sort of emotional victim. The AB books have always had a sensual storyline going on, but NiC went way beyond that. I wouldn't have minded the sex so much if it had been true to the Anita character. Every real fan knows the moral backbone Anita has had throughout the last nine books.Maybe Laurell Hamilton is tiring of Anita and wants to pursue her Princess Meredith series. In that case she should put Anita on hold until she's ready to give the character the type of story she (and the fans) truly deserve."
1,Skip It!,"I am so disappointed! I ravaged the first books in this series. I thought some of them were the scariest things I have ever read. But this one is just soft porn trash. Don't get me wrong, I like soft porn and Ms. Hamilton can sure slop it on with both hands; but my question is this: where is Anita Blake? I can't distinguish the ""Narcissus in Chains"" Anita from the ""Kiss of Shadows"" Merry Gentry. It seems that both women are surrounded by beautiful men who want to jump their bones and both are only too happy to comply. OK, I am fine with that; I am a guy for crying out loud. But I couldn't bring myself to slog through this mess. I didn't even finish the main sex scene between Anita and four guys (let's see, two vampires and two lycanthropes) before I put the book down in complete disappointment."
2,"Too much sex, not enough plot..","I have throughly enjoyed all of the books in the Anita Blake series. However, in the latest book, the emphasis seemed to be on Anita's ""complex"" sex life rather than on her investigative skills. I finished it, but I'll wait for the reviews before I order another of Laurell Hamilton's books. I was disappointed. If you like Laurell Hamilton, at least wait for the paperback version."
3,"Slow down, Laurell","I have read every single LKH novel since they originally were published, and I get the impression that this one was rushed. Very rushed. I think the real Anita is still there, still the sound hardcore heroine we all know and love, but Laurell, her backbone was trying to get the book on the shelf. Maybe it's the new baby, the new editor, who knows. I don't mind waiting an extra year for better quality."
3,A let down,"You really get let down with this one. This one one will make people not want to read the series. Everyone should start at the beging. Maybe even skip this one alltogether,you won't be missing much."
1,Do NOT judge the series on Narcissus,"I loved the first several books of the Anita series. I was disappointed in the last one but thought LKH might just need to adjust to the longer hardback format. Far from recovering from her little stumble, though, Hamilton takes a dive in Narcissus. Thin plot, weak new characters, and a dull situation in general with dull, repetetive sex scenes connected by drivel. I'd hate for someone to pick up Narcissus first and be turned off the rest of the series.Bring back the zombies, Laurell, or quit writing Anita and try to do better by Meredith."
4,Anita Grows Darker,"I had just reread ""Guilty Pleasures"" before reading ""Narcissus in Chains"" and the changes and growth of the main characters is typical of the mastery of Hamilton.Anita is pushed further into the world of her ""Cats"" the leopards she'd inherited after killing their leader. Fresh from the depths of Obsidion Butterfly's power, Anita is ready to defent those she loves, her home, and the innocents who too often get dragged into the fight between good and evil.Another wonderful example of Hamilton's writing- provocitve, downright scary at times, I couldn't put it down (Though it cost me a few night's sleep)."
2,Helloooo...Anita? Are you out there?,"Before even reading these reviews, my first thought after reading only a handful of paragraphs was ""What happened to Anita?"" The character's name might be Anita Blake, but was so far removed from the character which had been developing during the previous books.I'm sorry Ms. Hamilton, I know you probably put many hours into this manuscript, but it just felt wrong. It was almost as if someone else had written it, using Hamilton's name and knowing the basic mechanics, but the heart and soul had disappeared."
3,Its an Anita book...... but could have been so much more.,"NIC is a good read. I just re-read Ob. Butterfly before reading the new book. Transition is good and references are good. It does have some slow parts, but they are easily skimmed. Sex is quite prevalent in the book, similar to Kiss/Shadows, but is not the theme. However, I think the author is leaving the series open to explore the new side of Anita. It also covers the lych. politics in depth. I do agree with a reviewer who wrote the entire book seemed to be wrapped up too quickly at the end. The plot was good...... but could have been expanded to so much more. The subplot between Asher and JC could have been expanded or maybe Belle Morte? Maybe in the next books.......Overall, Anita is always a good read."
1,Has anyone seen the real Anita Blake?,"I eagerly pre-ordered this latest in the Anita Blake series and had been waiting very impatiently for its release...boy was I disappointed. Narcissus in Chains bears little resemblance to the series fans know and love. There were a number of things I didn't like about this book: the plot was weak, there were WAY too many sex scenes (Ms. Hamilton, leave this stuff to Princess Meredith and her series, please!) instead of Hamilton's usual tastefully erotic love scenes, and too many series ""regulars"" were nowhere to be found. Where was Edward? Willie? Larry? Animators, Inc? (Not to mention creepy Otto from Obsidian Butterfly!) Based upon the previous nine books in this series (all of which I've read multiple times), I barely recognized this Anita - her actions were way out of character and frankly, some were just tasteless. I sincerely hope that in book #11 we find Anita returned to her normal, sassy self."
4,Agree yet Disagree,"I agree that this book is not her best work in this series. However, the story line is as good as any other book by the author. It feels that she went to such lengths to describe things that I didn't really care to read about. I was into the story line and it would slow down to describe how a room was decorated or to reiterate how someone looked that had already been explained in a previous chapter. Love the story hate the over indulgence in useless detail. I will continue to read this series."
2,What Happened?,"I have read all of the vampire series and loved each one. Ms. Hamilton snagged me with her quick spunk, style and fortitude of her writing. I cant say what my excitement level was at thought of reading her new book. Unfortunately I wish I hadnt. Normally you cant put them down, this one I could hardly pick up. I dont know what happened but the characters came up short, especially Anita Blake, she seemed to turn her into some sort of weak, scatterbrained,sex starved person. There was way to much sex so much so that it became boring. Most of the main characters were there, a couple of new ones. But the whole story line lacked a great deal, there was just alot missing that normally is there inL. Hamilton's books. I can only hope her next one is better."
4,Anita???,"Something is going on with Anita, she isn't the same, then she is injured and must deal with Richard's need for angry vengeance. I miss the attitude, the plots. But, I know this too, can change! Four stars for my addiction to all things Anita!"
2,"Anita Blake fans, stop here","This is the book that kills the series. You try to give LKH the benefit of the doubt- everybody has a weak book in their series right? But several books later, you're like ""Why did I keep going? Where should I have stopped?"" RIGHT HERE. JUST STOP HERE. I know, curiosity gets the better of us, and we want more of what we used to have. But those of us who started the series because it contained a strong female protagonist in an interesting alternate reality will be disppointed from here on out. Anita develops a ""there's no problem I can't fix by f**king it"" mentality. Plots go bye bye. Character development goes bye bye. After this, it's just porn. If that's what you're looking for, fine you were warned. But there's better written porn out there if that's what you're looking for. I made the mistake of continuing for 5 more books.... don't repeat my mistakes. The Anita Blake we loved is dead."
4,I loved this book..I cant believe the bad reviews..,"Okay..I will admit that this book crossed the line into kinky, but I was so entertained I just didnt care. I will say that I didnt care for Micah overly much..the fact that hes little enough to swap clothes with Anita was just too disturbing. I for one have had enough of Richards whining..whats up with him? Infact..that was the biggest let down here for me..the powers between the 3 of them( Anita, J.C and Richard) dont really have anywhere to go because Richard just cant handle it. All in all this was a great book, but definitely not one for the faint of heart."
2,What is Hamilton Doing?,"I am a HUGE Anita Blake fan, but I was pretty turned off to this book. Its main topic seemed to be how many men does Anita need in her bed. I don't read the series for her sexual escapades with any male that is in the room with her and I didn't quite buy the reasons for this need in this one. I hope Hamilton's next book is more like the earlier books and that JC remains the top guy in the series. If Narcissus is a preview of what's ahead, I am jumping off this train NOW!"
5,WOW!,"THIs books totally rocks!Anita gets more powers and she kicks everyones ...!Furthermore, a bunch of new characters are introduced and Anitadevelopes a new relationship... I have read this book three timesand still I am not tired of it! Its a really really great read and if you like female charactersthat are smart, witty, and totally up front, thenread the entire series..."
4,Great Book,"Very Good! My first book read by Laurell K. Hamilton. Anita Blake the smart ... chick who can defeat both vampires and shapeshifters alike rules the world of both the light and the dark in a whirlwind of adventure, sex, and weapons."
5,The reasons why I like 'Narcissus in Chains'.,"'Narcissus in Chains' is a very interesting book. I loved it (just like all of the rest of Mrs.Hamilton's novels). The story involved the characters of Anita, Jean-Claude, Richard, and Asher. I am the kind of reader who is very picky when it concerns the novels I read and it is very hard to find a series that can hold my interest. This is why I must applaud Laurell K. Hamilton, she has a unique writing style that has spiked interest in not only me, but all of her faithful readers. For anyone interested in what these books have to offer; I enthuse you to buy her Anita Blake series. You will not be disappointed!"
3,"Too Much Sex, Not Enough Story","I used to love the Anita Blake series. I liked the love triangle between her, Jean-Claude and Richard. I liked the tongue/fang-in-cheek humor. I liked the were-folk societies and their politics. Now it's all sex and no story. Anita's new succubus side is stupid. It's very disappointing. I hope the next one will be better."
2,Padded,"Like so many others here, I found this book to be a major disappointment. And for many of the same reasons. If I had to use one word to discribe this one, that word would be ""padded"". It seems like once she'd written it, Hamilton came in 200-250 pages short, so she began having Anita start repeating herself. How many times did she tell us about what had happened up to this point...in detail? And the sex scenes got old real fast.I've read every book up to this one, and enjoyed every one (including Obsidian Butterfly, which others found disappointing, as well). And what I find most disturbing is the stuff that's missing. Is Anita even still working for Animators, Inc. or the police department? You'd never know it from this book.I'll be around for the next one, of course. I won't let one stumble chase me away. But more like this one, and I'll be gone. Sad, but still gone."
2,Narcissus in Chains Should be Chained Closed,"I have read all of the Anita Blake novels and this is by far the worst. Let me provide you with a synopsis. Friends disapproving of Anita's love life, trouble with the wereleopards, gang style fight, Anita saves the day but almost gets killed (...) I actually put the book down because I just couldn't take it any more. Some of the intimate moments were just too gross to read through. The book does not flow well. It's choppy: scene one, CUT, scene two, CUT and so on. And there is so much going on that you almost forget what happened in the beginning because there doesn't seem to be any connection with what's happening in the middle. Ms. Hamilton does manage to piece it together somewhat, but it's all just too much! Ms. Hamilton is always ""over the top"", but Narcissus in Chains makes you want to scream ENOUGH!"
1,The worst story line ever............what happen???,"I always enjoy reading L.K.H. books since the first one, but this has got to be the worst story line ever...Correction -NO STORY LINE- just sex,sex,sex...poor excuse for menopause (heat flashes,etc)Enjoy the previous books and skip this one."
2,The bottom of a downward spiral,"The ""plot"" of this latest in the Anita Blake series has degenerated to nothing more than a platform for bizarre sexual aberrations between a variety of ""monsters,"" from lycanthropes to the biggest monster herself. Richard and Jean Claude are portrayed with the depth of cartoon caricatures, others about whom one might care are abandoned along the way (Damian), and the ""cultural insights"" that once made the glimpses into the worlds of lycanthropy and vampirism intriguing are so long dead that it's unlikely even a necromancer could resurrect them. But hey, you sure know what everyone is wearing......."
2,Narcissus in Chains Review,"By far the poorest of Ms Hamiltons Anita Blake series.The author seemed more interested in putting Anita into any sort of sexual situation that she can think of, which would have been OK if i was reading a work of erotica. Instead i was hoping to read something else entirely. Nothing important or interesting happened until nearly half way through this book, which at 400+ pages made for some very dull reading.I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this, borrow it instead.Very dissappointing."
2,A new Anita?,"Narcissus in Chains was quite a departure from the other novels in the series. I would like to say at the start that I am an Anita Blake junky, and find Laurell Hamilton's alternate universe to be one of the more creative worlds an author has allowed me to visit in quite a while. That said however, I was quite disappointed when I finished this novel.Anita Blake ""Surrendering"" to anything.? Much less something requiring her to participate in group sex.?When I closed the book my first thought was that this was a collaboration with another author.Read by itself this book would be an interesting read if only for a glimpse of the world of Anita Blake.For Anita Blake fans, you will of course have to purchase the book. If you enjoyed A Kiss of Shadows and it's Main Character, you will probably enjoy this book as it seems to merge Meredith Gentry and Anita Blake into one person. If you enjoyed the Anita Blake who would rather die than ""surrender"", you will probably be disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"Laurell Hamilton's Narcissus in Chains, the tenth book in the Anita Blake series, was a huge disappointment. The major characters were almost unrecognizable in her latest work. Instead of focusing on solid characterization and coherent resolution, Narcissus in Chains seemed to focus on sex ... and how to get characters into sexual situations. The book left a lot to be desired (pun intended) to this long-time Anita Blake fan."
1,I want my money back.,"I am a great fan of the Anita Blake books and was more than excited when I picked this one up to read.I have never been more dissapointed with an author in my entire life.None of the characters were true to themselves, many too many faux character were added in for no good reason, there was no plot and way too much porn.I am so dissappointed I don't think I'll be buying any of her other books."
3,The sex is great but the plot drops the ball,"I've read and enjoyed every single one of Hamilton's books in this series, eating them up like naughty bon bons, despite plot flaws, blatant dropped threads, and the staginess of getting Anita into ANOTHER moment where having public sex while dressed in skimpy leather is the only way to save someone's life. I really enjoyed meeting the new man in Anita's life, but this book gypped your loyal readers, Laurell. There's a threesome promised at the beginning of this book, a threesome that's been promised long ago, and readers have been waiting for it patiently, waiting for Anita Blake to get over her prudery. But Laurell, you didn't deliver it. Richard's fade from the scene wasn't believable, wasn't even on stage. I would rather see him engage in the threesome and not be able to handle it than just have you dismiss him as a used-up creation of your own past discomfort with the sexual side of Anita."
3,"Not the best in the series, but not the worst.","This book was a little disappointing. It wasn't as good as some of the earlier books (""Blue Moon"", ""The Laughing Corpse""), and takes care of so much old business from previous books, it should not be the first someone tries in the series. The focus of this book is on shapeshifters, rather than vampires or zombies. The violence is back to a slightly more managable level, but now the sex scenes are excessive, even though the Richard/Jean-Claude thing has finally been resolved (yeah!). The thing that bothered me the most was the continuing trend -- every time Anita meets a new monster, she discovers a new super power. I liked it better when she had to be more resourceful with what she had, rather than just pull something out of left field. All in all, it's a must read for Anita fans, but doesn't really stand alone."
4,Narcissus in Chains,Yeah! Richard is gone sort of. Couldn't of happened to a nicer guy. Not that I don't like him which I don't but what a whiner. I wish he would just get over him self. This book was good not just because Richard might be a little more out of the picture. I have to admit though half way through I put the book down in shock. Not that the others books haven't had there moments but wow!!! I almost wasn't going to read the rest of the book. I consider my self to be a hard core Anita fan and I almost wavered. Well of course a day hadn't gone by before I was chewing my nails and making up all sorts of awful endings for the book. I finished it and wow. I'm still an Anita fan.
5,"hot, sexy and wild","I think this book was great. I think Laurell did a wonderful job of giving Anita a kick in the butt. I was sad that Richard and Anita are no longer together but I think it is for the best because they just couldn't get over their stubberness. But I do like Anita new love interest. Because he takes her for what she is and doesn't try to make her something she not. Anita is a strong willed, sexy, and knows that she is the only one that can make decision for herself. I hope the next Anita Blake novel will have the same effect this one did. I did not want to stop reading and I even got my husband into reading her series. I can't wait for the next adventure of Anita,Jean-claud, Richard and many more characters."
1,Very Sad......,This book made me consider Obsidian Butterfly as the true end of the Anita Blake series.She went from a strong women who could hang with the big boys to a women that has sex to make all of her problems go away. I'm not even a women and i feel offended!!!
1,Let the Disappoint Begin,"I've just completed the last book in this series. After reflecting back on the pain that I caused myself getting through the entire series, I have pinpointed this book as the beginning of the end. This book marks the end of a character to admire and to cheer for as she kicked some bad guy butt. I so admired Hamilton and her clever use of different mythologies and genres to create a world where I wanted to keep returning to book after book. All of that stopped with this book. It became less about a strong personality and more about a lame sex drive and even lamer men. I don't care if you add sex to the story, but Hamilton needs to add story to the sex. The rest of the series has glimmers of the clever and entertaining writing of the early series, but not enough to make it worth to time and soul draining ickiness needed to complete the series. I hope to find a charm to wear around my neck to keep me from purchasing the next book like a brain dead zombie."
1,Waste of money,"I really loved the Anita Blake series and even put up with the little bits of sexual encounters that were seen here and there. The plots were to my liking and I the character development was keeping me coming back for more. I could not make it through half of this book, because all the sex was getting in the way of the story. I will not read this series anymore because what had been some great urban paranormal fantasy has turned into something I am no longer interested in."
4,A Great Escape,"I must say I was a little hesitant about purchasing this book after reading some of the bad reviews of NIC however temptation overcame when I was the bookstore and I bought it anyway! I am truly glad I did. For 6 hours, I was transported into Anita's world and it was a welcome respite from happenings going on to the world today. Many of the complaints that I read is that the book had too much sex, I thought thought the sex/sensual scenes showed the growing up of Anita Blake, she was coming to terms with who she was and not who she thought she should be. The character development was great especially for Jason and Nathaniel, who have been my favorite 2 secondary characters. To Ms. Hamilton - I greatly enjoyed reading this book; thank you for this truly pleasurable bit of escapism!"
5,Absolutly Breathtaking!!!!!,"I have never read a book like Narcissus in Chains,EVER!It was capitvating and I could not put it down. I recieved it as a Christmas gift and I finished it in two days. This was the first book that I had even read from the Laurell H. series but it was easy to catch on, I could not bear to stop. Each character had their own special qualities and althoug others may disagree, I'm glad her and Richard are over, he's such a pain. Also, I'm probably not the only one that thinks this, but the relationship she had with Nathaniel was so cute,throughout the whole book I kept thinking he was going to die, but he didn't,:)I don't think I could have handled that. Hopefully in her next novel there is more of Nathanial, Damien, and Gregory, it seems that they were just left hanging. I can't wait for the next instalment. Until then I will definatly go back and read the previous novels, hopefully they are just as good as this one!!!!!!!"
1,If you can't afford to rent X-rated movies,"I had heard Laurell started writing her Fey series so she could 'get it out of her system' and bring the Anita Blake series back to what it was with the first few books. So when I checked this book out of our library, I had high hopes. After less than three dozen pages I saw what writing her other series did was just the opposite. Not only are we seeing the same level of wanton sex, we are now also seeing extreme torture and bondage. I tried to stick with it in the hopes the book would not be too bad, but when Anita ended up in bed with 4 men at the same time I called it quits. But Laurell did at least have the characters take steps to make sure Anita did not get pregnant."
2,Not so hot,"Ok, I don't exactly read LKH books for my edification, and I know this isn't exactly world-class literature here, but I think this book has been the worst in the AB series to date.Anita's personality is completely reversed, and she keeps making remarks like ""I should have done this"" or ""this was my cue for so and so."" It makes me wonder where the old Anita has gone all of a sudden. I also thought the situation w/ Micah was unbelievable. Why did she--paranoid Anita who always carries a gun--start trusting him again??Let's hope the next book salvages things a little more."
5,Great Book,"I loved this book. I thought LKH did a great job with this installation of the series. I liked the character development, the story arc. I could have done with out the introduction of a new main character but even with him, I thought that it was well written and though out."
5,chained,"Narcissus In Chains was different from the rest of the Anita Blake books,I liked Narcissus In Chains cause it dealt with more of the were policts and not just the vampires, Loved seening Richard and all my other favorite characters and true there was way to much sex but that was ok too and yes there could have more to the story but there is always the next book."
3,Not enough Sex,"OMG. How long do I have to ride on Anita's selfish morals. hey, guess what, JC has the same problem too, can he feed his beast? I'm a fan of the Anne Rice chronicles, and I'm used to the writer giving her readers what they want. I don't mind dragging out a good relationship, but ruining potential erotic seens that I and i'm sure plenty other readers have been dying to see happen is just plan ol nerve-racking.You say too much sex, I say not enough. Ok, Anita's a Hero. A big mouth, and show stealer. now can someone else have the spotlight without Anita jumping in to ruin the party with her shyness of the flesh and overcompensation for lack there of common sense! Too much false bravado! Thank goodness she was exposed to Jc ""problem"" now, maybe, we will really have some ""Erotism"" going on. not just holding hands, and shooting bullets."
4,great book why all the negative reviews?,"I could not put this book down and I have read all the earlier Anita Blake series. I just think the author is trying to make the charactor grow. I mean we do not all stay the same. Its been like what?, 4 years thru the series of this particular person and it seems everyone wants to read the same plot. I thought the book was great i could not put it down. I was a little disappointed that the Richard charactar can't seem to except himself and the end. All and all i still love this series and find Anita even more fascinating with all her newer powers coming into the story."
1,WEREWOLVES MATE FOR LIFE!,"To all who think Richard is gone, guess again. In NIC, it is brought up that werewolves behave like regular wolves. In this, thet Alpha male, Richard, picks his mate, Anita, for life. This is the explaination for his comment during ""Blue Moon"" where he is upset with Anita for finally giving him a ""choice"" and not giving up other men. The problem with all of this is that Anita has had classes in supernatural beings in college, per ""Blue Moon"", so why in the world does she not understand that Richard wants her for his mate. NIC is horrible because of the retread plot, Anita's ... attitude, new characters without explianation, Anita's gaining more vampire powers, and a lack of explainations for past actions, especially from ""Blue Moon"". Anita was spending 6 months learning about a werewolf pack, WHAT DID SHE LEARN? LKH has made Anita all powerfull and perfect (P U - hold your nose). This series is great, except for this book."
2,Worst of the series,Plenty of other readers have elaborated on the reasons this book isn't nearly as good as the others. I miss the old Anita Blake. This has been my favorite series of books for years. I'm so very disappointed. The plot gets so bogged down with sex and gore. I couldn't devour this book as quickly because the plot just wasn't very interesting. Definitely wait for the paperback.
2,Narcissus in Chains,"Was so thrilled to find Anita Blake series about strong woman, gutsy, independent woman which mixed my two favorite genres: supernatural and vampire. Yeah! Read several of the earlier books than hit this book and only felt disappointment and yes, disgust that the author had to use the ""ardeur"" to throw the reader into a quagmire of sexual exploits. I can read romance novels if I wanted all that. Why was this necessary? I almost gave up on the book but out of loyalty I finished it...hoping that the ""ardeur"" would pass. But no...I just started Cerulean Sins...and the smut continues. So that ends my loyalty to Anita. Will no longer be recommending it to friends. How sad! The plots have suffered for the sex. Too bad."
2,It SUCKED!...And in a BAD way!,"I have followed the exciting heroine, Anita, through all of her nine thrill rides in the past books. However, when I read this one, I got sick! I didn't think that it could get this bad.It seems that Anita has lost so much of herself. She has gotten all of her marks in this book and a new lover also. Richard, at the end, is thrown out of the picture, having not completley accepted his werewolf nature. Jeane-Claude is not as important as he used to be to Anita, and i'm sorry to say that she has become a slut, nothing like she was in the first books.I'm so sad it has to be this way, but hey, I can make up my own ending where Anita ends up with Jeane-Claude and only Jeane-Claude, Micah is gay, and Richard finds a new lupa. I'm a sucker for good endings!"
1,Yuck.,Previous reviewers were right. This is pornography. This is the last book in this series I will read.
1,Dissapointed with the turn in the story line.,"Anita Blake started out as an interesting character, which was at odds with being who she was with what she did. She had morals and boundaries. Now she has none of those things, she kills whoever gets in her way and sleeps with everyone with no regards to anyone's feelings or any reference to what her one time high morals used to be."
2,not what I'd hoped for,"After eagerly awaiting the new Anita Blake novel, I'm very disappointed- definitely not of Laurel Hamilton's ususal quality- major characters are underdeveloped, plot twists have no explanation, and Anita acts out of character- more like Merry Gentry, but even more gratuitous. I'm hoping that future books are back to the standards I've come to expect from Laurel Hamilton."
2,Hamilton is reduced to sex alone.,"One of the true beauties of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake sagas has been the eroticism and realism of the character caught up in ""unreal"" situations. ""Narcissus"" goes further into the ""unreal"", further into the erotic, and further away from realism. While I still look forward to any other book in this series, Ms. Hamilton's disappointing last three books would not convince me to essay any other series she starts. I personally look forward to see how Ms. Blake resolves her life, but don't as whole-heartedly urge new readers to take up this project as the latter books in this series have been dissapointing in style, content and narrative."
3,"still a hard book to put down, but something is missing....","Narcissus in Chains was a book I eagerly anticipated. Like the rest of the Anita Blake series, I waited until I had a whole day fre to read it, knowing I would have a hard time putting it down. That much was true, but with the end of the book I felt something was missing. I'm not sure I can pinpoint exatly what it was, but the plot, while filled to bursting with new characters and old, just did not make it. I've been waiting for some sense of closure, insight, or sercure attachment on Anita's part, and while that happened more or less with Anita's wereleopards.... the rest of her actions seem less thought-out as usual, when I was hoping for more. Color me dissapointed and searching for that indefineable something that made the previous books worth reading and keeping."
2,Narcissus in Chains,This book was sick-and I do not mean in a cool way. This was straight Porn! I cannot believe that Laurell K would let her character go like this!!
1,Disappointing,This book did not further the overall arc of the story. Blue Moon is the best book of this series.
2,"I like sex too, but ....","I liked the earlier Anita Blake books. There was more humor and I enjoyed her job duties. She started going down hill in Blue Moon. While I like sex as much as the next person, I feel the story line has suffered. They just aren't as much fun to read as they used to be. The fun banter between Anita, Jacques and Richard was enjoyable. A free-spirited, take-charge woman holding her own with two domineering men. Now, she's not all human, but horny as heck. Her Meredith Gentry books started out with unlimited sex, so I've pretty much come to expect lots in that series."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING?!,"I first discovered the Anita Blake series this year and loved all of them.WHAT HAPPENED?This is without a doubt the worst book I have EVER read. This book has no plot, familiar characters that wandered off into never-never land, page after page of scenes and sex that do not make sense and are not relevant to what little plot there is in this book.The new ""Micah"" character (bye the way - where did he come from?) is just creepy. Richard and Jean-Claude are only peripheral characters this time around and when we do see them, their personalities are so altered that you almost don't recognize them. Jean-Claude, for example, was acting like Anita's personal pet poodle. What happened to the smart mouthed master vampire that we all loved to be annoyed by?As one who eagerly awaited this installement of the series, I was greatly dissapointed. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!"
1,Not even Anita can raise this series from the dead,This book marks the death of one of my favorite dark fantacy/horror charactors.What was once a quality series has finally completed its devolution into adolecent wish fulfillment.I'd rate it even lower if I could.
1,No real plot,"I loved all the books in the A. Blake series until this one. The other reviews that gave low ratings have already explained the problems with this novel and I don't need to repeat it. I tried two times to read this book and managed to read half only. It is so bad with no plot and the usually charming characters (Anita, Jean-Claude, Richard) have turned into perverted psychopaths, completely unlikable. I wish I never started this book and only kept the earlier as a pleasant memory. I wont even look at any more books from this author."
2,Series jumps the shark with this book!,"Series jumps the shark (can I use that for a book?) right here with this book....get it from the library and see for yourself. New fans, do yourself a favor and stop here...you will only be disappointed! Old fans might want to just skip ahead to the newest, Skin Trade, which was better than the drivel in between all these books, and you won't have missed anything but lots of tasteless sex."
2,Meh,"My least favorite so far. Too much sex, too much arguing, and not enough plot development. Introducing a conflict, like the one with Jacob, and then finishing it up in the epilogue was a bit cheap. All through the book I was expecting some kind of big showdown between the two of them and then I get, ""my first order of business was to execute Jacob."" WTF?"
2,What happened?,"As I said in my last review, I was hoping that the downhill slope that Hamilton is heading with the series must stop with this book, but I was left disappointed. The book remained in the pattern that it took after Obsidian Butterfly and if this continues, the fans of the series will certainly look for alternative options.This novel indeed introduced a new character but also was an addition to the growing pile of Anita's lovers which is not really a good since if you ask me. I don't mind reading erotica but reading it 80% of the novel is just too much for me. As Anita was described to have embraced her growing powers but it just somewhat made her more promiscuous and made the novel soft porn. I don't want to use that term but it's what the book is giving me.Reading the book I realized that I skim through pages to avoid reading the steamy parts. The initial story of the book seemed lost and I'm wondering if Hamilton can bring justice to the series again with the future books."
5,Hamilton is an Awesome Author,This installment of the Anita Blake books was great. Anita is finally coming into her own. I love the new characters and the turn of events that kept me guessing all the way until the end of the book. I got it on a Friday finished on Sunday and reread it again starting on Monday. This book was great. I cannot wait for the next book.
3,A need-to-read for fans.,"I was a little disappointed with Laurell K. Hamilton's 10th book, Narcissus in Chains, only because it did not follow the same format as the previous books did. There is very little going on except for the details about Anita's new abilities. The only time a mystery is even introduced is towards the end, almost as an after thought. However, that's okay. the character development that was explored was needed and, I believe, will add a new direction for the series, instead of a same monster, different day pattern it was beginning to fall into. However, if you don't read this book, you may be lost when the next comes out.i love this series and I think Narcissus in Chains was a satisfying, if not typical, book to add to the series."
3,"entertaining, but..","Yes, Im in agreement with other reviews about the sudden casualness and excessiveness of sex in NiC. Anita seems to have lost many of her morals.. I enjoyed the books a lot more when she was still trying to resist Jean-Claude, not that I dont like him. He seems to have lost his personality in this book. NiC makes me worry about where Anita is going to end up next, how many people she is going to have a supernatural tristes with in the next book. It makes me a little sad. I suppose if this is so, future books with be good for little more than light entertainment and personal ah, sexual pleasures."
5,Anita Fan All the Way!,"I gotta say this is my favorite out of the whole series. It gives us a great conclusion of the Jean-Claude/Richard conflict and introduces some great new characters, like Anita's new boyfriend. As a Jean-Claude fan I especially loved how LKH got rid of the temperamental, insenitive, wimp, Richard. In NIC, Anita gets a new guy, who accepts her for who she is. Anita finally comes to terms with herself as this book show a different side of her, while still dominant but having human emotions too.A great book for all Anita fans."
1,What the crunk....,"Ok...if all that you read for is sex, and if sex is all you think about then go for this book, but if your like me and need some plot to go along with your story stay the heck away from this.Long time Anita fans also beware. This book is of course a tale taking place after OB...but oddly enough when I read it it didn't feel at all like Anita and just had me thinking 'Did I miss a book somewhere?'Lets all hope and pray that LKH gets out of the funk she's in and brings us back some real storytelling and not some dime-smut like this.In two words: Big Disapointment"
1,Porn with fangs,"A complete waste; of time, of money, of paper, you name it. Unless, of course, you enjoy voyeuristically wallowing in someone else's fantasies. It must have been difficult for Amazon to find six pages from this book to display that DON'T consist entirely of turgid sex scenes. And, even those weren't well written, in my opinion, though some of the female reviewers here seemed to like it. So, maybe it's a guy thing. The fact remains this book is basically porn, occasionally interrupted by other events."
3,Fenris ulven,"I love LKH books about AB.I was a little disapointedat this book but I'm going to keep on reading the series.Some might say that AB acts immature and lack morals,I don't think so .She only got her own version of moralsI don't think this books are for everyone,but speaking for myself this is a very good book and it's the best series i have ever read.LKH could have had a bit less sex in this book,but hey she's the writer."
1,Barely readable,"I'm not a prude and don't turn twenty-seven shades of red if I read something ""raw"" or twisted, but this book delves far, far too deeply into the sexual underworld of bondage, deviancy, etc, etc. Was it really necessary? It took me 3 tries to actually get into this book and I still don't see the point of it. I realize that Anita Blake is not your normal paranormal character, but somewhere along the line the author took a seriously wrong turn and now what used to be an enjoyable series has turned into hard core porn. Why? All she needs to add now are some ""Oh, baby, harder, harder!"" type comments into the writing and it won't be anything different from the books the neighborhood perv reads.What a sad turn for what was once such a promising character."
1,Absolutely AWFUL,"I am a HUGE fan of the Anita Blake books. This is my second time through the series and they're just as good as the first time. However, this one absolutely lacks plot. The characters you've come to know and love are dull and flat and down right whiny. There's way too much sex in this particular novel. I mean sure, a little sex is good but seriously? The whole thing is sex, sex, sex. She leaves no clues as to who the villain is so you're surprised at the end which is good. But there's NO plot until the last like 13% of the novel. I was extremely disappointed but don't let this one bad apple deter you from the reading the rest of the series."
1,Stop reading the Anita Blake series before you read this one.,"Up to this book, this is a pretty good series, but I've now read though all but Blood Noir and I won't read any more (I would have stopped at this one but I'd already bought the whole series). Anita has lost almost all of the qualities I liked about her by this book, her independence, strength, and self reliance. She's always needy and that always requires some type of sex with someone different. Gosh, does that get boring. Ms. Hamilton has forgotten or given up on writing a plot for these stories and just goes from one sexual situation to another. No more for me."
4,Pretty good overall.,"This was a pretty good book overall with a sound plot and good characters. Although there were some sections that I thought was a bit racy and bordering on pornographic, this series is not for the faint of heart so I accept it as part of the author's vision. I'm aware that there are those who are not satisfied with the book, that's their opinion. I can only suggest that if you are a fan of Anita Blake, read the book yourself and form your own judgements not based on what you as the reader want to happen, but the logical progression of the character."
2,Difficulty Finishing This Book,"When I discovered the Anita Blake Series I fell in love. I devoured all the books prior to this one. It took several tries before I was able to finish it. With the books prior to this one, I'd stay up all night and read until done. I kept getting stuck on this one. I couldn't ""swallow"" all the unnecessary, poorly written sexual content. I'm thoroughly disappointed."
3,A big let down,"After reading Obsidian Butterfly I was expecting Narcissus in Chains to be just as good. It was a big let down since so many of the original elements are gone. Important characters are left in the shadows, including Richard and Jean-Claude. A new man is brought into the mix and Anita accepts him way to easily. The plot is there, but so watered down by sex that it's hard to find.The Anita everybody came to love is gone. The strong female character, one of the reasons I read the books, is gone. She's seems to have lost her edge. My recomendation, read the other books before. Killing Dance, Blue Moon, and Obsidian Butterfly are some of the best. Here's hoping that the next book is better and Micah is dropped completely."
1,not a memorable book,This entire series is a Mary-Sue. Take one look at the author's picture and then read the description of Anita. Anita is the center of every single character's world. Every male abases themselves before her. Every female character either hates her or looks to her for protection. The police apparently can't do their jobs and it's up to her to fix things. Blah blah blah blah blah. It's basically 'Twilight' with porn except for the personalities of the main characters. I'm just glad I bought the books for a few cents instead of full price.
2,What a disappointment,"I have been reading the Anita books and loved it ever since Guilty Pleasures. That is why I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book. I'm halfway through the book already and still there's not even a hint of a big bad. After the scene at the club, it's like 200 pages of repetative sex scene nonsense. I found myself glossing through paragraphs just to get to the end of the chapter. It feels like LKH ran out of things to write and stretched a scene into 5 chapters. I mean the curing Gregory part was just wayyyyyy tooooooo loooonnngggg... If the remaining books are like this, I think I'm going to pass it. AND Anita is getting to be so annoying. Whatever happened to her raising the dead or her police work or hell does she even works at her office anymore?"
2,Sigh...,"Alright, first off, I gave it two stars because /I/ didn't like it overmuch, but that doesn't mean it's Worlds Most Horrible Book. I think LKH overdid the sex, and recently Anita has shifted from the witty, sharp witted character I found so fun in the begining of the series. Re-reading Guilty Pleasures and Circus of the Damned after reading Narcissus in Chains made that really clear. I was unhappy to see so little of the police group, and Animators Inc...especially Zerbrowski (And Larry, whatever happened to him???) Again, I'm not putting a big DO NOT READ sign on this book, it has it's good (and bad) points, but more of a warning, this is a big change, and if the Anita from the early books is who you loved (Gag me with a spoon etc), you might want to skip this one."
3,"Still Literary Candy, but Quality is Slipping","I have been a huge fan of Anita since I happened to pick up ""Guilty Pleasures"" as a random choice way back when. It was great, and I snatched up the sequels as soon as they were on the shelves. Heck, I still anxiously await her new releases, and I read this latest chapter in the Anita Blake saga and enjoyed it.However...It's beginning to turn into more of a romance series than sci-fi/fantasy/horror series. I preferred the sex how it was in the first books- just enough to fire up your imagination. ""Kiss of Shadows"" definitely shocked me with all that sex, especially when her last release was the decidedly horror focused ""Obsidian Butterfly"". I like the Meredith Gentry series as more of an erotic thing (it just fits with fairies in my mind), but I want the old Anita back."
5,Evolution of a Heroine,"I love this book. Having read all of the A Blake series , I found this book particularly entertaining, someones been walking on the wild side(DS anyone ?). The always in control Anita finally losing control. Having to depend on others to keept her grounded, safe, to meet her needs. It' a'int shakespeare but then again what is ? Great escapism, and still one of the strongest women in contemporary print."
1,Disappointed Australian,"Hi - I have been (like most of the other reviewers) an Anita Blake fan for years but I too found her latest effort dismal and disappointing - it's almost like someone else wrote it - this isn't some sort of VC Andrews thing is it(After Virginia Andrews died the whole family took over and started writing her novels)? This book spends far too much talking about clothes and explaining everything in exhausting detail, and YES there is too much sex and Anita has way too many roles & super powers (what's this ardeur thing?). Also what's happened to Jean Claude - is he to become a wimpy character with almost no coverage in Ms Hamilton's novels? There also seems to a very homoerotic aspect in this novel which I find unnecessary, will Jean Claude be wearing a dress in the next book? Anyway I'm not happy and will think twice about buying the next one."
1,Proves Kiss Of Shadows is the new LKH style,"As has been pointed out by many other reviewers here, NiC is soft-core porn. Among the many faithful Anita Blake followers, it was for her nickname The Executioner that we loved her. In the latest (10th) of the series, Anita Blake is hard to distinguish from Meredith Gentry from KoS. It was hoped that LKH would use her ""Dark Farie"" Kiss of Shadows novels as her erotic line and leave Anita Blake Vampire Hunter to what LKH does best , ie action scenes with intense characterization.I am presently loaning out my copy of Narcissus in Chains so others won't buy the hardback. Most say they will buy a paperback or used copy later, but they are in no hurry. This is from people who have been reading LKH since the first of this series. Here's hoping LKH gets Anita back on track in the future."
1,Sad Downfall of a Wonderful Series,"The decline is finally complete and I will not be reading any of the new Anita Blake books. Hamilton has transformed a witty and unique series into supernatural smut. Our heroine is no longer a stong woman determined to use her abilities against ""the monsters"" but rather a whiny and indecisive ""monster"" herself.If you need to get a hit of Anita Blake, go back to the early books."
1,Sorely disappointed,"I was sorely disappointed by this book. i have been an avid reader of the whole series but with the last couple of books this series is on a seriousl decline. Anita is the most irrating character in the series, it would almost be perferrable if she was written out completely.Lately Anita is becoming more and more dominent while all the other characters become more and more subservient to her will. I don't encourange anyone to buy this book. if you have to read it, save yourself some money and rent it from the libary."
1,This was the worst of the Anita Blake vampire novels.,Of all the Anita Blake vampire novels this was the worst. I am a devoted reader of this series and this was a total change of pace from any of the other books. There was way to much talk about sex and the characters had almost turned psychotic about it. I prey her next book Cerulean Sins is a lot better.
3,Narcissus in what?,"NIC was a-ok. Not great, but ok. I'm pretty sick of Anita getting all of these goddam powers...and her little ""modesty"" even though she's, like, sleeping with a kazillion men. Where are Jean-Claude's witty remarks?"
2,Disappointing/Softcore,"After Obsidian Butterfly being one of the best in the Anita Blake series, you've now come to the worst.There's very little storyline, or character development. Though it has a couple of moments, there's hardly any action to speak of... apart from... action in the bedroom.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to a bit of spice but I'd like some substance to back it up. At some points this seems like so much slash.And what happened to the title character?"
2,"Anita, Powerpuff Girl?","The 10th book in the Anita Blake-Vampire Hunter series continues the disturbing trend of the last few books, especially the last 2, of heaping ridiculous power after ridiculous power onto Anita Blake. Thats fine if you're into reading comic books heroines that leap tall buildings in a single bound and ""kick-..."", but if you are looking for complex, mature, human females, you're probably going to want to skip these books from here on out. Anita doesn't even remotely resemble one anymore.I gave the book 2 stars for the marrying of the marks in the beginning....a start that promised a better book then delivered, and Jean-Claude finally losing his temper with the childish Anita."
1,"Sex & Violence, and not much else.","I've read all the Anita Blake books, and enjoyed them all, except this one. I've thought for several books that Anita was getting too violent, but in this one, she loses the last shreds of her morals, and appears dedicated to pursuing all the sex, violence, and violent sex she can get. This book is almost totally plotless! Anita used to be a great character I could love and admire- the Anita in this book is just a bloodthirsty ..."
1,Goodbye to the Anita Blake I loved from the start,"Horrible, just horrible. This was the beginning of the end of the Anita Blake series for me. Books 1 thru 9 were great reads, books 10 thru 14 left me frustrated and upset with the person Anita became. I did enjoy The Harlequin but it was just a little too late in my opinion."
1,Stop now!,"For anyone who is reading Ms Hamilton's series in order, I suggest you stop with Obsidian Butterfly and call yourself content. The later books in the series, starting with Narcissus in Chains, then Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams do not follow the formula which enamoured early readers.In Narcissus in Chains, Anita changes from a formidible trigger happy somewhat prudish zombie raiser, to a hedonistic magical wonderwoman in thigh highs and a miniskirt with a stable of 'committed lovers' (none of whom are human).If you like your porn with little or no plot, then go ahead and buy it - but for goodness sakes, go to the library, a second hand bookstore or get the paperback. Waste as little money as possible on this prurient prose."
4,Classic Anita,"For those of you familiar with our vampire slayer, you'll be in for a treat with Narcissus in Chains. Blake returns to her stomping grounds of St. Louis to find all hell has broken loose in her pard. Anita saves her kidnapped wereleopards from a cross dressing D/S patron. It is here where we have found out that during the past six months of her absense, a lot has changed: including Anita.Hamilton piles on the action in this new installment of the Blake series, we see the same interplay with male/female roles. I think it is fair to say that it is Anita, herself, who is the most masculine of the characters in the book. This novel is a thrill ride that leaves you gasping for air at every turn."
3,Narcissus in Chains reveals Hamilton as a Guilty Pleasure,"The fact that this book makes a significant break from the regular pattern on Anita Blake novels should be no surprise to the reader as they reflect on the book. While attempting to keep the same pattern, hence the subplot with Narcissus, Micah, and other new werepeople, it really tries to delve into Anita's personal life more. Those looking for a horror/mystery novel with a little sex thrown in on the side, the regular pattern of Anita Blake novels, may be unpleasantly surprised. This book is more of a personal drama/romance novel with horror and a little mystery thrown in."
3,Trite Language,"Liked the story, saw nothing wrong with the sex and missed Edward. But Ms. Hamilton, PLEASE stop using the same tired old phrasing over and over again. Examples...the description of ""blood and thicker things."" The use of the phrase that a person's remains are ""like so much meat."" That the vampires and the shapeshifters could ""benchpress"" a (fill in heavy object here). That Edward is ""the epitome of WASP breeding."" Perhaps I'm more sensitive to such things because I'm an editor, but the trite phrase repetition really sets my teeth on edge."
2,How sad it is,"Laurell Hamilton ""jumped the shark"" with this book. I have read all of the Anita Blake series & was highly disappointed with this one. The plot was VERY thin to non-existent. I don't mind the sex as long as it fits in the storyline & doesn't seem like it IS the storyline. I hope the next book is better."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I *LOVED* this series - when it was about Anita Blake, Vampire Killer. Whatever happened to her? It seems this book was just an excuse for the author to write erotica - fine if that is what LKH wants to do, but don't destroy the Anita series doing it. Get Anita back on track! The gratuitous sex is just boring - what's next, a three-way in the bank lobby becomes necessary in order for Anita to be able to use her ATM card?"
1,Character Building . . . ?,"In what universe? The characters, even Anita, were flat and barely recognizable. The first few chapters of the book were great, until Anita woke up in bed with a couple of strange wereleopards. After that, I had to force myself to finish the book. I've read the other books, especially Burnt Offerings and Blue Moon, to pieces. Yet this one sits on my shelf, collecting dust. What happened to the humor? The mystery? The action? If I wanted sex, I would have bought erotica.Don't waste your money."
2,"LKH gives us her equivalent to ""The Phantom Menace""","Don't get me wrong, Laurell K Hamilton is still my favorite author. I have gobbled up her previous 9 Anita Blake novels, and they continue to be old favorites on nights when I want to revisit my favorite butt-kicking heroine.Narcissus in Chains very much reminded me of ""The Phantom Menace: Star Wars Episode I"". Huge buildup, waited a long time, and it fell flat for me. I might have liked it a little if I didn't have the previous 9 to compare it to. The plot and character depth just wasn't there.However, I felt that Anita's butt-kicking ability didn't shine through in this book. She cried SO many times! She bitched and demanded in a whiney fashon. She got sex, ALOT. Everyone seemed to pander to her. From Jean Claude to the entire lycanthrope community.Will I buy her next book? You bet. One off book doesn't write an author off my list. Will I recommend this book to anyone? I'd say wait until it comes out on paperback."
1,Skip it,"This is a great series, but skip this book. There are many Laurell K. Hamilton fans - I'm one - who would recommend this book because it's hers, but it's just bad.Sex and violence are fine if they are appropriate to the story and moves it forward. In this book the violence is so extreme that you skip pages just to get past it. For instance the Horrific Thing in this story not only gets loose in a hospital but... and I couldn't believe she needed to so this, but heads right for the nursery! Yep you bet. The carnage is so over the top that it become ineffectual and takes you away from the story. I actually stopped reading this book because I lost interest.She has many much better books to pick from I recommend you save your pennies for any of her earlier books in the series."
2,I hope this is part of a longish plot line that goes on,"First of all, I don't mind normally reading a steaming chapter or two of sexual encouters, but this time it was just to much of the same.Too darn much sex, sex, sex and not much else - especially when LKH needs 10 to 15 pages to describe one sexual encounter.It gets to the point where you ask yourself where the story is ?The fact also that LKH in her intro says her usual clique of writer friends didn't see this one due to time constraints, points sort of the way to a novel that was quickly written.All is not lost, if you're an optimist like me though - this could also be the book that describes Anita's descent into 'hell' and in the next book her fight against it and her climb back out of it. How to get rid of the marks ? How to get rid of the sex ?I'll wait for the next one to check if Anita as we know it survives...I'll be sorely disappointed if the next one doesn't"
2,What happened?,"I have loved the Anita Blake books for years, but this book has really turned me off. What was Ms. Hamilton thinking? The characters have totally changed, and I am seriously considering not only not reading any more, but also getting rid of the books I have now. It was a complete disappointment--more so because I stood in line for two hours to have her sign the book. Now I wish I could return it."
4,Still going strong!!!,"I too was worried when I read the bad reviews of this book. I will now ignore them going forward. I was hooked into this series long ago and I appreciate the way that Anita and the extensive cast of characters have evolved. If you don't like books that are sexual in nature then don't read them. If you've gotten this far and are are bent on bashing the future installments I just don't know what to say. If you are a lover of the later books then keep going....they just keep delivering great action, fantastic characters, witty sarcasm (my favorite) and so much more."
1,A very depressing book.,I thought it was a very depressing book. It was confussing and the ending did not tie it together like I would of thought. I had to read it for school and I know two other people that agree with me. It would be a good book if I could understand the point of it.
5,Just when I thought Cormier's work couldn't get any better..,"Wow! All I can say is WOW! WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW! I Am the Cheese is so amazing. The writing style is amazing, and don't even get me started on the surprises at the end. I never expected that Adam or Paul or whoever was insane! And WOW! The symbolism of the title, being revealed at the end! GENIUS! The cheese stands alone and Adam or Paul is the cheese, and therefore stands alone. The repetition of the opening paragraph at the end was effective, I think. I truly believe ""Brint"" is working to see if Adam or Paul can remember who killed his mother and father. I agree with Brint in thinking it is personell number 2222 (Grey) because in Adam or Paul's flashback to when his mother died, he mentioned gray pants and said it was ""him."" All in all, this novel was a wonderful read an I would sincerely reccomend it to anyone."
2,I AM THE CHEESE- NOT TOO GOOD,"I AM THE CHEESE IS ABOUT A KID TAKING THEARAPY TO REMEMBER HIS PAST. HE FINDS ABOUT HIS SECRECT LIFE AND YOU FIND OUT IT'S A BIT INTRESTING. THIS BOOK IS VERY, VERY CONFUSING AND SHOULD BE READ BY PEOPLE OVER 15. OKAY ENDING BUT CHOCHOLATE WAR, ANOTHER OF ROBERTS BOOKS IS A LOT BETTER."
2,Who cut the cheese?,"I feel that ""I am The Cheese"" was a well written book. Although the style of his writing was interesting, I beleive this book was very bad. It made little sense and it was way too complicated. I got bored with so many details. The plot was good but the way it was stretched made the book unenjoyable."
2,Weirdaly Weird,"This book was DEFINITELY NOT one of the best books. It was very confusing and I kept reading back. I definitely would have stop reading it, if it weren't for school. The plot is very weird, in that it starts off making no sense what so ever, in the end it all makes some sense but it is confusing up till that point. I would not recommend it unless you like a book like that."
2,This Cheese stinks,"This book was kind of hard to read, it didn't flow very well among other authors like Gary Paulsen's books. Cormier was very random, although the ending was very amusing."
1,What I Think,"Personally, i think the book ""i am the cheese"" was a waste of my time. it was hard to understand and if i didn't have to read it for school, then i wouldn't have read it. i was forced to read this book so therefore i found little excitement in this book. through the book, the author doesn't make his subjects clear which made me confused. actually, i think this book was so bad it shouldn't even receive on star - maybe a 1/2 of a star."
1,This book was definatly not for me!,"When I started reading this book I had a lot of questions from the first couple of chapters. It leaves you in a weird suspence. In some of the books that I read this was a really good thing to have because it was a mystery. That kind of book needs suspence. Now I Am the Cheese on the other hand, used it completely wrong. He made it so that the reader got confused. This isn't a good thing to do. The skipping back and forth from storylines just in my opinion stunk.All in all I did not like this book."
1,If you like to be depressed-read this book!,"This book is about a troubled boy wandering through practically a nightmare--his own life story. As a result of a government conspiracy, he is seriously mixed up on funny drugs and his life is destroyed. The end is a surprise, and very depressing."
3,"A well written book, very confusing though","I am a 14 year old, and got this assigned for summer reading. I am not at all stupid, I had a high A average in English last year, but I just didn't understand the book. The characters and emotions were written incredibly brilliantly, but Cormier went back in fourth too much, and I didn't understand it. It is two stories, woven together horribly. Maybe I just can not think because it is summer, but I would recommend it anyways.... It is a thinker!"
3,What happened to an ending?,"At first this book was very eye catching and suspensful. I always wanted to read more even though I thought it to be very confusing. The book jumps from past to present and sometimes its hard to keep up. But i continued to read it, interested in how this strange book was going to turn out. Well once I finished I was just about as confused as I was to begin with, maybe even more. This book didn't have an ending! Well at least not one that I could understand, it was terribley confusing and left me at a cliff hanger. 3 stars for a waste of time."
3,"like a Sick and Twisted ""Wizard of Oz.""","Most of the one-star reviews are due to this book being a recipe for hopelessness, and that is an accurate picture of this book. What I find most interesting is the Biblical metaphors. The main character, Adam, greatly parallels the Adam of Genesis, including the curse of Adam that he would have to be a Farmer. His girlfriend, Amy, is like Eve in being created for Adam. And the antagonists in this book have an eerily hidden quality. I use the plural ""antagonists"" due to both the sides of the struggle Adam finds himself in being essentially antagonistic, and deeply intermixed.How much you'll enjoy this book depends on how much you like David Lynch movies, Memento, and [neo-noir] genre in general."
5,Essential Reading,"I remember where I was and what I was doing as I read the last page of the book. On a subway train in Boston. I felt like the book hit me hard in the face with all its might. I wanted to cry out, to share my pain. I looked around at all the silent, bored faces. It seemd so ironic. One of the most powerful books I have ever read. It has stayed with me 7 years after having read it. Kudos, Mr. Cormier."
1,the weridest book i've ever read,"wow. this book was really, well...different let's put it. it centers around a young, mentally unstable boy, Adam Farmer, who thinks that he is riding his bike to see his father. Adam is really in a psychiatric hospital being treated, and his ""doctor,"" Brint, is trying to help him recall memories. All his memories lead up to Adam remembering something great, something so great that it could treat him mental ""issues."" This book has an ending one would not expect."
1,Too Confusing,"I was constantly confused during the whole novel. I didn't understand what was real, if the kid was making some of the stuff up or not. At the end of the novel I was absolutely speechless and had no clue what I had read."
1,"""I am the Cheese""","I think that this review section should have a zero on it because this book definitely does not need one star. I think that this book was too hard to understand, because the story kept on switching from the interview, to the bike ride, and to the flashbacks. Also, I think that Cormier could have developed the characters more than he did. He developed Adam too much and everyone else that he met on the bike ride, his parents, Amy Hertz, and Grey not enough. This was probably the dumbest and most confusing book that I have ever read. I think that the school board should not make this a required reading title. Overall I think this was a horrible book."
1,Generally boring and uneventful til the end.,"This book is useless, boring, and horibly written. It is a total waste of one's time. Robert Cromier is gonna' get it. I thought the WINDOWS manual was much more interresting. This book deserves a shallow grave in a bottom-less pit."
1,I couldn't put this book down!!,"Literally, I was forced to read this. The scary thing is I voted to read this. The whole mental institution thing appealed me. Unfortunatly I was wrong. This book is confusing in all ways. The only way I could understand the ending is for my teacher to reveal the ending for me. Trust me, don't get this book."
1,The Cheese Stands alone.,"First of all, this book is WACKY! My seventh grade honors class was FORCED to read it. It is very understandable but the plot is a little zany. A boy rides a bike around...This book was also an eyeopener to some people life styles. Cough-Arthur-cough. Now, I know that he was trying to send a message of some sort but I couldn't exactly figure it out. What - their are loony people out their? This book was also the [back side] of MANY jokes. Anyway, I found this book.... interesting."
1,Worst book ive ever read,I am the cheese was the worst book i have ever read. It was confusing and i was continuously going back and reading sections over again. If i wasnt reading it in school i would have thrown the thing away five pages into the book. I am wtiting this review to tell anybody who hast read it not to read it.
5,I am the Cheese,"The book 'I am the Cheese' is an overall very interesting book. Its great story line built up as more information was revealed and more questions were answered. Even though this book was very confusing at first, everything started to fall into place at the very end. I liked how all the characters Adam met throughout the book came back at the very end to create a shocking ending that I never expected. I thought Robert Cormier did an excellent job on 'I am the Cheese' because of the suspense this book had that made me want to read it even more. 'I am the Cheese' was a great book."
3,I am the Cheese Review,The format of the book I Am the Cheese is very confusing but it makes the book interesting. When reading this book you are always trying to figure out what is going on between the characters and where its taking place. Robert Cormier wrote this book as if it could happen in real life. Its written about a boys life and what had happened as his life progressed.
4,Always had you thinking,"I am the cheese was one of the best books I've read in class. It always had you thinking about the next thing that could happen and wanted to read on to see what happens. The end was very abrupt and unbelievable. Robert Cormier did a wonderful job of keeping the reader wondering and confused at times. I would recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a stunning, full filled, exciting book!"
4,I am the Cheese,"This book was confusing at first, but towards the end it started to make sense. I tought this book was interesting also. It made you use your brain. There were little bits and pieces of this story that were used later on and that helped you figure out what was going on. At the end I was still a little confused, but once I thought it over twice it made sense. Over-all this would be a book for people who like to solve mysteries. This was a very perplexed story."
2,What was the point?,This was a confusing book in which i didn't understand. I admit the title was all that interested me in the 1st place.
3,Pretty good...that is if you get it.,"I read this book for school and was happily surprised when the book wasn't the usual boring, drawn out, painful to read type of assigned reading. I am the cheese was interesting and exciting. It kept you turing the page until you couldn't anymore. There was only one problem; throughout the whole book, you were never quite sure of what was going on. This feature is part of what makes the book so great, but even at the end, most of your questions will remain unsolved. This isn't the type of book that makes you smile after reading the final words. It was refreshing to read a book that makes you think after you had long closed its pages. The only problem was that you could not find answers to your thoughts and questions. Much of the book is unsaid. A lot goes on without being written on the page-it's there for you to figure out and decide. Annoying, but good."
3,Discussion is recommended,"""I am the Cheese"" is written by Robert Cormier. It is a book about a boy named Adam Farmer, trying to remember his past, aided by psychiatric interviews. The book follows a strange format, three different narratives, skipping from one narrative to another. This strange format can be confusing to some people, and my recommendation is to discuss what is going on with someone else who has read the book.The language that Cormier uses is very effective, creating strong images in his desciption of characters, settings and places. This is reflected in the use of figurative language, ""The two chairs are piled on one another like a kind of obscene embrace.""In conclusion, the book is quite effective when describing, however I strongly recommend that discussion about the book is needed if you are to get a strong grasp on what has actually happened."
4,I stand alone,"I am the Cheese was an exciting yet depressing book. It is so interesting you don't want to put it down. When I was reading it, I felt as though I was in it. It seemed as though you're experiencing the same things that Adam Farmer experiences. This book is about how Adam Farmer has to find and face his past. He comes to realize he has to live his life never knowing whom to trust. He also recognizes his need to forgive his parents for concealing the secrets of their previous identity. It was a stirring book reading how Adam Farmer did stand alone."
3,Weird!,"I read this book and my first thought was ""Hmmm....."" I read this while I was in the 5th grade (last year) and I got in trouble for reading it during class. Oops. Hehe. Anyway, it was funny. Weird funny. If you like this book you should read The Music of Dolphins by Karen Hesse. I think thats the right name and title. They both are...... different. I give it a 6 cause it's just a bit hard to understand. **WARNING** This is not a poem book! That's what I first thought it was."
3,What?,I read this book for school and even though I had assistance in understanding and I could not always understand it.I did like the author had simbolism throughout the book that I could not see untill the end. Although the end could be better.I would not read it again and say it is a so-so book
4,A very strange but interesting read,This is a very memorable book and interesting and thought provoking.
1,Magical Realism with a Dark Bent,"If you like stories about long journeys to nowhere, like Tim O'Brien's Going After Cacciato, then this is the book for you. If you like tales of preposterous journeys inside the heads of shell-shocked kids, then this is a great read. If you like to blame it all on the government, this book will make you happy. And if you have the misfortune to be assigned this book in class, imitate the hero and stare at your teacher in dumb silence."
1,Horrible,"I read this book and I thaught it sucked. I dont know how that author even got it published it was so bad. It is the kind of book that gives you a migrain headache if you read too much of it consecutively. I suggest that if your thinking of reading it, think again, it suck."
1,counfusing,"i don't recomend it. you have to fill in the blanks, figure out whats happening. just counfusing. they switch betwwen him riding his bike, and him with Brint(doctor). i couldn't figure out which was happening first."
2,Blair at Richview Middle School,"Possibly the worst thing I've ever set my eyes on. This is a story about a boy on an expedition to give his father a parcel of some sort. The main characters in this book are Adam the main character in this story,Amy Adams girlfriend,Adams Father,and Adams mother.Adams expedition begins when he delivers a gift.His Father is ill in the hospital . Oh yeah the plot of the story he rides a bycycle.He finnaly reaches his destination and finds that his faters is dead.Wow what a great book . I dont see why people praise over this book."
3,This book is very confusing.,"I think this story has a wonderful line and a unique format. The format makes it very difficult to follow, but has a wonderful element of suprise at the end. The title is understood in the last four words of the book. I just read this (7th grade) recomended by my literature teacher. i have mixed feelings about this book and would recomend it to anyone willing to submit to chaos."
4,Quite an amazing story,"I first read I am the Cheese when I was only twelve years old. Now, I am a graduate student studying literature and literary theory. I used the book in a composition class that I taught to freshmen last fall; the entire class loved it. I feel that I am the Cheese is a perfect book for young adults, as it probes Adam's identity quest so well. I remember a strong feeling of empathy when I read the book; the same feeling I got when I first read the Catcher in the Rye. Corimer's three-part narrative is as eerie as it is intriguing, and I think that touch is one of the many reasons the book is so absorbing. He handles everything a teenager feels, from the pangs of first love to the heartbreak of shattered innocence. I'd recommend it to both new readers and to teachers who are seeking a good text to use in class."
3,Cheese,"I thought ""I Am The Cheese"" was a very interesting book. If you are not used to reading books that go back and forth between many situations then this book may be hard to read. It is like a small puzzle that does not come into focus until the very end."
3,It's the CHEESE book!,"I think this was a book that was set-up really, really complicated. It's so unique! Everything that happens in the book is a clue to the end of the story. However, I did not particularly like the book because it was so confusing! This was because every thought and action of the boy was portrayed in the way where it takes a lot of thinking and imagination. But even so, the overall story was interesting...hard to put down...especially at the end!"
5,The Cheese Stands Alone,"Robert Cormier did an excellent job writing this book. The book was absolutely riveting. I personally loved it. The three stories that he put together to help understand one whole story was great. I especially liked how the title tied in with the book. The only part of the book that I found a bit confusing was who actually was the ""pyschiatrist"" and what did the 2nd to last chapter mean? (the one with all the numbers and writing). If anyone can answer these questions for me, please email me. All in all though, it was a wonderful book and I would recommend it to any mature young adults who like books that actually make you think."
5,Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"One of my favorite books I have ever read is by Robert Cormier. This book is titled I Am the Cheese. This mind-twisting book starts out with a kid named Adam in two different scenarios. Those scenarios are he and his family going through some hard times because his parents know he his suspecting something strange about them. The other scenario is Adam traveling from Monument, Massachusetts all the way to Rutterburg, Vermont. The catch his he's on his bike. Adam eventually finds out he is living in a fiction book. His Father is running from a special organization that he protested against a few years ago. He hired the man named Grey, or was it? Grey gave them new identities and new occupations. Then they have to take an urgent vacation and they see a... Find out what happens by reading this amazing book that I strongly recommend."
2,WOW its pretty wierd,that was the wierds book i have eva readit was very involved and boring for most of the time and i find it very difficult to understand and how he was in the nursing home all the time and he was just dreaming his story it was wierd
2,I Am The Cheese,"I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful writing of this book, but after just finishing it this afternoon, I still have no idea what was going on in the story.Using chapters that alternate between (apparent) real-life and the main character speaking with an adult named Brint, Mr. Cormier does a marvelous job at making every reader of this book confused beyond his/her wits.The ending-although there might be a slight chance that I understood it correctly-is too irrational and outlandish to fit smoothly into the plot and Mr. Cormier is apt to puzzle you with it...that is, IF you allow yourself to go near this book. Don't. You'll be glad I spared you from it!P.S. If anyone would like to explain this book to me, please contact me as soon as possible, putting the title of the book in the subject."
2,Skitzo and Freakish!,"What was Robert Cormier on when he wrote this book?!? I Am The Cheese was not only very confusing but boring as well. We had to read it for our summer assignment. Robert Cormier's idea of a skitzofrenic male in a mental hospital was not only childish but very unprofessional. Not one of the estimated 30 of us in class could understand or care about what was going on. And the POKEY THE PIG? Hello! I expected something a bit more important! The characters Adam Farmer and Brint were the most confusing. In conclusion, I am not the only one that hates this book. I would never recommend it to someone unless I hate the person! Even then I would not be so cruel! And the denoument in the end was probably the only part of the book I actually understood! Sorry Robert! Thanks!"
4,"Weird, but Good Nonetheless","I was drawn to read this book because of its, ah, strange title, and I'm really glad that I did. The story is a whirlpool of events that happen when the main character is on his way to find his real father. The ending really caught me off guard because I wasn't expecting it at all, but that made it even more great. You won't be dissapointed if you read this book. Confused a little... yeah... but not dissapointed."
5,"Emotional, but EXCELLENT!","I Am the Cheese was excellent! It was also very emotional. I would only recomend this book to people who can handle emotional books. During certain parts I began to cry, others I wanted to throw the book, but I was in school. At first it was kind-of confusing, but at the end it is all explained. I thought the only bad part was the author did not explain the pills. My favorite part was reading about the ""Numbers"". Until the end I did not understand the idea behind the tapes, but it was all explained. The book was full of suspense, it kept you wondering, thinking, up to the last few chapters...This book was one of the best books I read this year!"
3,mixed feelings,"well, the parts where Brint (the phsyciatrist) was interviewing Adam, that was really boring. But Adams so called ""journey"" was very interesting to read about. This book was so-so. If you like mind games, you will like this."
3,I am the cheese,"This book had an interesting plot. There wasn't much action until the end, and for me, I didn't like to wait. If you're a reader who appreciates very descriptive writings and twisted plots, this is your dream book!"
3,Ehh?,I thought this book was okay. It had some good mystery quality to it and it also had a nice trick ending. I would recommend this book to people who like to think about what they just read. Even though I only read this book because of school I think I would have read it if somebody told me about it.
4,Bittersweet Masterpiece,The ending of this book was very surprising btu the book overall was a satisfying read. I'd recommend it for middle schoolers.
3,"Good plot, but difficult to understand.","I think this book had a good plot. But it was so confusing! I didn't understand it, so I thought more information would come later. It didn't. The book kept me so confused."
3,This is a phsyco book.,"This book was very confusing. Ex.-He could never reach Amy Hertz on the phone. I know that was in his dream world, but did he really call that guy with the flu? This book dug deep into my mind. Probobaly a little too deep. It is a phsyco book in my opinion. It is written so that I can read it with ease, but it has all these tangles in there. I knew it was a phsyco book from the begining. Oh, and was that guy that told him where his bike was gay?"
5,ahh. memories,"I remember reading this in high school. It was the only book in the curriculum (spelling?) that i enjoyed and read on my own. read it... Oh yeah, isn't it banned now?"
2,I Am The Cheese by Robert Cormier,"I find this book to be confusing. There are many interpretations. I have tried to figure them all out, however how do I know which is correct. Is he so paranoid that he dreams up all his stories? Has the government nabbed him up and is holding him to find out the truth about his family?It starts out with Adam riding his bike in search of his father at a hospital. After many encounters with who you think are strangers while he is riding his bike, the last chapter ties all those so called strangers together as familiar people. While reading this book it jumps from past to present in which you as the reader are not sure where Adam is coming from. While Adam is on his journey on his bike he seems so alone and confused....I found that this book could have explained itself better. I was left feeling empathy for Adam and very confused about the ending. It sort of leaves you hanging."
5,Totally Unexpected,"I appreciate the ending being totally unexpected. I was kept guessing as to what was going to happen during the entire book, during his interviews, his memories, and his bike ride. Excellent!"
4,Compelling Reading,"I really enjoyed this book and the only reason I didn't rate it higher is that I felt there were a few loose ends at the end.Adam Farmer is undergoing psychoanalysis. Little by little he seems to remember things. The more he remembers he finds out that the life he thought he came from is a lie.The author uses interesting story-telling in that some chapters follow the continuing story of Adam making a bicycle trek over a couple of days and encountering attack dogs, bullies, bad weather, and a bike thief, while on the way to meet his father to give a gift.The other chapters are either straight narrative as Adam remembers things and there are also question and answer sessions between Adam and the analysist that is interrogating him.The varied writing style makes the book flow by pretty fast. I was able to get through this one in a few hours."
2,Rochelle's Review,This book is very confusing at the start but once you read on it starts to make scence.It is also more confusing because the book is written out in three different types of narration.It somtimes kept you in suspense but the ending was very twisted.
2,Im the cheese,"I Am the Cheese is about how a boy, named Adam, who has to remember his lost past. His past is forgotten because it is too painful for him to remember by himself, but he has help from a doctor. Throughout the book he describes his bike ride to his fathers house, that never happened, and the challenges along the way.It is a confusing book, and I would not recommend it to younger readers. The book is boring and drags on. I had to read the book twice before I could understand it properly. The author brought his point across which was, that you can't trust anyone in this world anymore."
2,This book is just too confusing!,"I don't see how they could possibly call this book ""young adult"". I'm 14, and I'd like to think I'm pretty intelligent, but this book is so confusing. It is constantly switching scenes, or narrators, or whatever you want to call it. You can hardly keep track of it. It's not that this book is so bad, it's just that it's so baffling. I did actually think it was OK. I like the ending, it is totally unexpected. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read it though. Also, I really like the title. I had to have a book for a book review at school, and I picked I am the Cheese because I thought the title was funny. I read and read and it had nothing to with cheese. Then, I came to realize that it has to do with ""The Farmer and the Dell"". Adam, the main character, is constantly singing it, but we don't really know why. But the song says ""the cheese stands alone""... And HE IS THE CHEESE"
5,Fantastic Young Adult Book,"I read this book in middle school and vaguely remembered the plot. All I knew was that I loved reading it, so I bought it to read again. This is a fantastic book and I highly recommend it!"
5,An excellent box set!!!,This is a fantastic compilation that for the first time brings together every variation of the Beatles early Hamburg recordings with singer Tony Sheridan. The sound quality is the best ever and the book that is included with the package is absolutely stunning.(Apple records take note. This is how all future Beatles compilations should look!)
5,Useful and Informative,"For anyone who is interest in the history of Latvia, this book is a MUST. The book does not go in great depth. But presents the reader with highlights of Latvian history, culture, and chronology. Most of the book consists of a historical dictionary. The historical dictionary, portion of the book, is interesting. After the dictionary, I would rate the bibliography as interesting and useful. It is 25-1/2 pages long.This book is a MUST, for the Latvian historian."
1,Horrible Do Not Get It!!,This product was horrible. It is like they just put water and sprinkles into a bottle and called it glitter!! I am very disapointed.
4,Hindsight: Boris Vallejo--His Photographic Art,"I have always been a fan of Boris and his methods of coming up with a painting. But what has really interested me in his work is his portrail of the human body. Now that I have seen his book and witnessed his love for the human form, I see why his paintings look so real. The models he uses are believeable in the poses they do. I recomend it to people who have a love for the human form and also a love for Boris' work. It is also good for practing drawing the human form as I have used it for so many practice sessions."
5,All you need,All you need in one pack for equine care. Recommended. Durable. High quality. Essential to care for your four legged friends.
1,Unhappy with Purchase,"I purchased this toy for my son's six birthday, when it arrived, I loved the simplicity of it's set up. The tracks just snapped together with no problem. However, once I tried to connect the powerpack, the metal connectors came off. I could not connect the train to the power and had to return to sender. I would not recommend this product."
3,Train keeps falling off !!,"I bought this because it was on special. My 4 year old son loves trains and I thought this would be great for him. When we got it, we quickly put the tracks together. The tracks snap on differently than other model tracks.When we put the train set on the tracks, the train would ride right off the tracks in certain areas. I thought it was because I installed the tracks incorrectly, but I double checked it and all looked good. But the train kept on riding off the rails.Luckily I already have a set of tracks from different purchase and used those instead. The train ran perfectly on those tracks. Because I only paid $25 for the whole set, I'm not too upset over it."
3,Train Collector,I enjoy trains. My son got a Life Like Train for Christmas and I decided to get one for myself. It's alot of fun and easy to snap together. You can easily run it on the carpet too. I bought it because mine is an older one and not a power lock. The engine is not a eight wheel drive but great for starters. I plan to by a more track and a trussel so I can run it with my son's.
3,Life like Train set,Pretty good over all set for the price. Easy to put together and easy to run. It's not as durable as the old steel trains I used to have but not a bad starter set for a boy or girl interested in trains.
1,With a heavy heart,"Guns N' Roses es genial y Slash es uno de mis guitarristas favoritos. Este es el hombre que creó los fabulosos licks deAppetite for Destructiony me duele en el alma y me destruye el corazón verlo envuelto en la producción de esta basura. El álbum es basura y la artista en la carátula posee un talento nulo. Comprar esta producción es simplemente avalar la mediocridad y el mundo estúpido de las telenovelas y de los dioses y figuras creadas al dedillo por los asquerosos Univisión y Telemundo, la maldición de los latinos en los Estados Unidos. Ananda es monstruoso and Paulina (as always, nothing new here) sucks big time."
3,Paulina and pink,This album is ok but I just hate the fact that she's always copying madonna when madonna came out the cowboy hat's there she goe's madonna where pink on her cover now paulina why can't people be original creative on there own
2,"Should Be Titled ""Annoying""","Latin music is one of my favorite types. I really wanted to like this album but wound up disappointed. On several songs Paulina sounds like a spoiled brat giving a definite ""Shh"" sound to words with ""S"". It's VERY annoying and any Spanish speaking person over the age of 15 should say ""What-the-Heck?"". On the plus side there are at least 2 keepers particularly ""Ni Una Sola Palabra"" and ""Retrato"". Grow up, Paulina."
2,Pau-pau = zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I really like Paulina, I really do. But let me tell you why I like her. First of all she is a HORRIBLE singer. And that my friends, is why I like her. She's so bad she's good. But when you deliver an album this boring, the awful vocals just don't cut it. I just thought this album was very bland, very boring and uninspiring. I don't think she's done an album this bad since EL TIEMPO ES ORO. And even then that album had some good songs. I just hope her next effort (be it in English or Spanish) is fun and she doesn't try to take herself so seriously. When she does it comes off as a Reik/RBD wannabe sounding album. And that's not saying much."
5,AWESOME,Love the whole CD! Every track is very well produced & I like the fact that Paulina always changes her music. One again Paulina delivers a top selling CD
4,"THIS CD IS GOOD ENOUGH,Paulina is style","Paulina Rubio made an excellent job in this cd. Although,the sound is very similar to Coti and Julieta Venegas,It sounds better in Paulina style.New rhytms and beats,some pop-regeton in ""Tu y yo"".The song ""N.O"" is the best in this cd after ""Ni Una Sola Palabra""All songs are my favorites but ,""lo que pensamos"" is the most stupid song that Paulina has recorded, after ""la Escoba""( in her first cd).This song must have been out of this cd. Oh!! the cover is so pink!!! and to me, looks very annoy to the sight.Anyway this cd is good enough to the general public.(even to Thalia's fans)"
1,"Cheap, boring, commercial & uninteresting","Bought this CD when I was in Florida. Was looking for some latin music, a genre that I like but I don't know many artists.Got this album as this was in the Latin charts and the cover let me think this is a very happy sounding album.Unfortunately not. It's a terrible album, with lack of originality and spirit. Not some artist to need to know!Waste of money, time and energy listening to this record.(Haven't found a decent female version of Juan Luis Guerra and artists of the same quality) :("
3,Don't know how to adjust to this album,"I really hate to write this, but I really don't know what to make of this album. I have always loved every single album she has made, (including border girl), and I just don't know what to make of this one. I mean some songs are ok, but for the most part I went thru the album and did not get the feeling I got when I did the same with Paulina, PauLatina, 24Kilates, El Tiempo es Oro, etc . . . Maybe some remixes or bonus tracks will help this album. I still like it, its just definitely my least liked Paulina alum. I think Paulina let someone else take control of production rather than doing it herself. I will just wait for the next one."
1,My daughter HATED this movie!!!,"Heartwarming...yeah right.My daughter who is 10 freaked out when she saw Marlowe get hit by a car and killed - especially since that happened to one of our dogs a few years ago.THEN the dog is a ghost and there's some sort of time limit before something bad happens???Now she's freaking out again afraid she'll have nightmares.I didn't read very far into the plot synopsis so I didn't realize the dog got killed...Had I known that I would have never rented it.PG doesn't necessarily mean ""good sense"" or actually appropriate for sensitive kids!!!"
1,I HATED this movie,"This movie was incredibly terrible. I rented it for my metrosexual son, Brody, and was expecting some nice family entertainment.After the movie Brody threw our beloved Norwegian Elkhound, Snickers, into the path of an oncoming SUV. He was shocked when Snickers failed to recover after dumping a bucket of water on the remains. Then Brody tried to revive Snickers by blowing on a dog whistle, and blew so hard he ruptured his eardrums.Now Brody spends most of his time in Happy Acres hospital and I dont have anything to help me hunt moose.Thanks Cop Dog, you ruined my life!"
3,Cop Dog,"Eh, not as good as firehouse dog and lacking the vision of Administrative Service Manager Dog. That said at least the dog and puppys at the end are cute."
2,"not bad ,a insightful look at a wild time","the book is cool, even better is ""High On Rebellion; Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic Frogs,Jayne County, Cherry Vanilla,etc THE REAL SCENE! YEAH!"
2,New edition not worth the hike in price; little new!,"Mainly the same stuff; just a way to increase royalties for the professors. Voolhardt drives a Ferrari, he needs to pay those monthly payments!"
4,A Well-Written Text,"A very well-written text, Vollhardt covers basic functional groups in organic chemistry and even difunctional compounds, carbohydrates, polycyclic benzenoid and heterocycles. With very plain language and explicit illustrations, each chapter provides a summary of new reactions and plenty of exercises. The intensity of this book is along the line with McMurry's Organic Chemistry. This book is suitable for especially students studying biological sciences who need an overview in organic chemistry."
5,Very good book for .chemistry sudent,"befor i bought the book me & my friend check alot of books and we think this book is one of the best book today on the market the book show u and explain u how reaction are going in color (very nice and use full ) in the last of each section u have a summery reaction list and the exrcise are very good like in the test & this book come with very nice prog that exercise u and show u 3d reaction like sn1,sn2,e1,e2 benzen reaction and more any way don't hate organic chemistry soooooo much :-) bye bye ,and good luck on your's exam y.m bar-ilan university"
5,Richer with every viewing,"Of course Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible. Of course the script by Rebecca Miller, daughter of Arthur, is inspired. Of course the visuals are lovely. But this intimate, unusual story really does take you by surprise (against all odds). It's sort of a disturbing tale, though, so it's only for you if you like upsetting little films such asThe Sweet Hereafterand the like."
4,Slice of Life - well done,"Small independent films either grab you or they don't. I liked this film because Daniel Day Lewis creates a character who isn't perfect but realizes the consequences of his choices on his daughter. Some may think there is incest involved, but I feel that because Jack and Rose live in an isolated environment they become very close. Jack realizes that Rose needs to learn to socialize with others, especially since he has a heart condition. Rose does not like the change of bringing other people into their lives. The actors convey their emotions and we know what they are feeling. This is a character study and may not be to everyone's taste. But I found the characters interesting and the acting stellar."
2,Just an OK movie,"Not one of Day-Lewis best movies.Mr. Day-Lweis acting is, as usual...very good but the story has many holes, many cliches, way to extremist on the view of the world, private enterprise and American values."
2,Too bad...not much here,"This was a disappointing movie. It started very slowly, unfolded very slowly, and gave not much result. I could not develop any empathy for the characters.The father, played by Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day Lewis, was rather depressing (because he is dying, I suppose he is entitled to feel that way), and the daughter, Camilla Belle, was quite disturbed, and most of her actions were unbelievable.The whole bit about the secret girlfriend and her family moving in on a moments notice was odd, and I did not feel any chemistry between the two lovers.Some brief incestuous undertones, allusions to one of the boys being gay, the promiscuity by a couple of teens seemed a bit out of place. I can't imagine the beautiful girl wanting sex (even out of spite) with either of the available young males.Too slow, with weird characters. Written and directed by DD Lewis' wife, and made pretty cheaply, which explains some of it."
4,I didn't like it,I think movies are an aquired taste...some good movies go unnoticed simply because they dont have huge stars in them and who knows...maybe this was one of them.Suffice to say I did not enjoy this...It was too slow for my taste but it wasn't bad at all. The acting was good and the plot was fine as well. I'm giving it 4 stars because it was a good drama.I just didn't like it
1,The worst movie in years,Too bad you can't give this clunker 0 stars. While the acting was fair to mid-ling the plot was nowhere to be found. It is a waste of time....
2,Got on my nerves,"At first, I figured this was an incest movie, and there are hints of that, even though that turns out to be a false alarm from the opening moments. Instead, it's a tale about misplaced hippy-dippy values as Daniel Day-Lewis battles developers on an island that seems like a deserted Martha's Vineyard. He's rich so he can afford not to work while living in a leftover 70s commune while waiting to die young from a heart condition. Problem is I never really cared about the characters, and the fairy-like daughter just got on my nerves. She just needed to be smacked."
2,Too film-schooly for me,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it was just too dull and uninteresting to make an impact. I found the loud pop music to be intrusive and unnecessary for the ""plot development"" (such as it was). I also found myself longing for the lead female character to find a pair of tweezers and another facial expression besides ""dazed"" before the film ended, but she never did.There are only two reasons you may want to see this film, and that's why I gave it two stars: Daniel Day-Lewis gives a great performance, and the cinematography is actually quite good. Other than that ... blah."
1,Unrealistic,"Very pretty nature photography, but a totally unrealistic story with some unrealistic characters.Rose goes swimming but doesn't get wet.Rose spends days in a pristine white frock and never gets soiled or rumpled.Rose uses one facial expression whether she's ""so happy"" or setting fire to her home.Rose, innocent and young, aggressively propositions boys.Come ON!The girlfriend was the only real character in the whole film. Turns out she was an extortionist with the good sense to be afraid of dangerous snakes.All I could think when watching Jack and Rose lying in the New England weeds was ""Ach! Think of the ticks.""The DVD's volume varied so much that I missed dialog and ended up not really caring."
2,Stay away,I might have liked this in my 20's. I found the movie through an amazon link from the movie Off th Map(my favorite). I think this could have been a beautiful movie but for some reason the writer/director needed to throw in sexual taboos and some unnecessary violence. I can handle this stuff from Tarrantino but I just think everything seemed forced and overall a wasted opportunity for a great environmental movie that made us think.
2,What a strange little movie,"If your wife bought it a year or two ago and you've both been avoiding watching it since then and she doesn't know why she bought it at all and refuses to remember doing so and you're looking at that name and being really turned off by ballads and a possible Titanic reference, just quit procrastinating and pop it into your DVD player. It's not as bad as all that.If you haven't bought it, I wouldn't rush out to the store or the Amazon shopping cart for it, but if you have it, go ahead and watch it. It's strange, you'll laugh in spots, and Daniel Day-Lewis is still Daniel Day-Lewis. You might find it hard to care about any of the characters, but oh well. It's not a bad movie, really, and it's probably different than what you've been watching anyway."
4,Quite the change from ON...,"I've been using this product for about one week now. Before, I had been consuming ON 100% Whey Double Chocolate, which did not taste the best, but was definitely palatable. Upon drinking my first ""whey and water"" with this product, I almost gagged. Compared to ON, it is incredibly sweet (REALLY SWEET), and tastes nasty.It is protein though... I give it 4 out of 5 for just that reason. It does its job fine, but the taste is not so great."
1,not a very good book,personally i think this book wasnt very good first of all it toook too long and there wasnt much action or anything most of the book was just talking and talking and talking i thought this book was such a waste of time because all the narrator did was talk and getting nowhere to the point i think this iz 1 of the worst books i own. this is not a good book in my opinion.
4,It was Jesse's darkest Hour...can u say cliff-hanger....,"This is the fourth book in the amazing ""Mediator"" series. I found the beginning of the book to be excellent but in the middle it got boring at parts but the ending made up for it. The ending of this book has a ton of action and excitment...you can't stop reading just to see how it ends...let me tell you one thing you better have the fifth one next to you when you finish this one....a great book in the series! Myfourth favorite! Great fun read!"
4,Best in the series,"Suze's summer vacation is ruined because she had to get a job as a babysitter at a pricey hotel. Suze's charge is eight year old Jack Slater, who was utterly boring until Suze discovered he is also a mediator. Things haven't remained quiet on the ghost front either. Maria de Silva, Jessie's fiance/murder, has returned from the dead to finish the job she started more than a century ago.This is the fourth installment in The Mediator series and probably my favorite one as well. The plot followed the basic `murderous ghost somehow tied to Suze's latest love interest' plot except this time the love interest was Jessie. Yay for the plot finally going somewhere. I also really liked Jack and thought it was cool that Suze got a tiny mediator to teach (or corrupt) This series is still really fun for a light read and I'm sure future books in the series will be just as good."
4,decent mask,"I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter to wear when she pitches in her fastpitch games. It fits well and adjusts easily. She says that it does not impair her visibility. The only complaint that she does have is that the chin pad does not stay on in her bat bag and she constantly has to search for her and reapply it to the mask. Overall though, it seems to be a good product."
3,Good overall,"The book addresses color extensively, which is just what I wanted when I bought it. What it lacks in is describing how to properly arrange furniture in a room beyond some basics, and covers very little in the way of accessories in the room. How much is too much, how do you arrange what you have so it looks nice instead of like clutter? Lots of possiblities for a second book."
1,Badly produced junk!,"If you purchased this for 1 cent + postage - demand a refund, you paid too much. The film quality is terrible! This is a cheap copy of a very well made original. The latter is a product of the U.S. government, so copyright free. Thus the really bad quality of this video is a crime. Even the slick box art is bad, as the first part of Capra's series has little to do with massed B-17s! Avoid and seek a better copy, or watch on the net."
1,American Propoganda,"These movies were perfect for the US troops in World War II. They caused anger in the troops. It made them want to fight.As for being of historical value - well... they aren't. Take anything you watch with a grain of salt. Some of it may be true, some is not correct at all. The Americans use basic propoganda techniques like constantly repeating what Hitler said, and then showing what he did. The movies don't bother to tell how the political climate had changed and Hitler had been forced to act against what he had originally promised.I'm a history professor at a well-established university (sorry, can't tell you which one... anonymity is key to survival). I would not use this to teach my classes. The real facts are very different from what the movies portray.As I said... They served their purpose to boost morale in the troops back in 1944-45... but to the general public it is just hogwash."
4,Good video on the start of World War II.,"This video shows how Japan, Italy and Germany got to be powerfull nations and ready for war. Good video for people who are not very sure how the war started."
4,Ok.. but full of platitudes,"Ok.. but full of the platitudes that plague this particular genre. The author would be better off pointing out that profitability points two ways, rather than one; both inwards (to company employees) and outwards (to the 'customer' side of things). As for the main point, I disagree; market share IS predictive of profit (to a large degree). The difficulty is maintenance of marketshare; but companies have covered a huge hurdle if they can get to be market leader."
3,Myopic Premise,"There is no question that sustained profitability must be the underlying intent of any economic firm. Likewise, the ""Business Design"" must be aligned with this intent. However, this is only half the puzzle. How does the firm ""deliver the goods."" The answer takes us to its Resources and Capabilities. R&C enable Strategic Flexibility. This is not an easy topic to cover with a pedantic understanding of the economic firm. Can you imagine a U.S. Military who wanted to create ""full spectrum dominance"" but never spent the time, energy and money investing in superior technologies, doctrine, and soldiers? The book far misses this point."
5,Yes! A fantastic read!,"I'm glad I picked up this book. It made me look at business in a whole new light. I recommend it to anybody interested in business or strategy. Clear, concise, wonderful!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I just ordered this, thinking how cool it would be to protect my very fragile phone. I got the cover, and discovered that it doesn't snap together well enough to actually fit over the phone. It is VERY close, but not quite well made enough. It is also a very thin plastic, which will hardly protect such a heavy phone against impact. If the phone were dropped, the plastic case will probably crack or pop off, leaving your phone unprotected."
5,These guys deserve attention in the US! They are überleet!!!,"These 4 guys, 2 of them twins, are the hottest and fastest rising German group in Europe. They are so hot that they have virtually taken all of that continent over by ""monsoon"" and that even includes all of France! Their music is fresh, clean, and hopeful, but best of all they are a great rock band. Their music is awesome in both German and English although I'm getting off on the German music more than the English even thought I don't understand German (except what I've learned listening to TH). This DVD (of mine) is PAL (non playable in US) so most US should get it in NTSC. Be aware that this DVD is entirely in German. This young group is already very polished. 5 stars all the way. This is one Hawaii fan that could only wish they'd come here. THEY ROCK!"
3,This book is useful for junior engineer of scanner maker.,"If you are junior engineer or marketing people of scanner maker, YES, this is the book you want.This is not an ABC book. It is not an advacned, either. You need some technical background to read this book. If you want to buy a scanner or learn how to use scanner, try others.From chapter 1 to 10, it focus on the product definition. It telds you what kind of scanner should be made for current market. From chapter 11, there are basic theory about scanner and how to tell the image quality.Too few pictures in this book. Some phenomena is hard to descipt."
2,Not for beginner or office application. Too technical,"If you are using scanner solely for pictures and/or graphics, this book may be helpful. There is very little information for office application such as scanning documents and placing in Microsoft Word. Too technical for a beginner."
5,Hot Dog Griller Review,This is an excellent way to cook hot dogs on the grill. We had two other grillers similar to this one and since one broke I had to order another one. This one has enough room for 10 hot dogs. Everybody loves to eat hot dogs from this Hot Dog Griller. The Rosewood handle makes it easy to move the hot dogs back and forth.
5,Nice Dogs,"The item arrived as adevrtised. The hot dog cooker is really pretty neat works on brats as well as one would expect. I did not need one of these but a neighbor had a cookout and was using one similar. So I went to Amazon.com and found the one I bought. It does a nice job on the dogs and I can still burn them, which is good. I would recommend this product."
5,Works well and it's easy!,"This is a simple product but it does the trick. I know that most kids I've ever barbequed hot dogs for don't like them when they get a little black on the skin from not getting turned over in time. This solves that problem. The first time I used it at a barbeque, I had several people checking it out and how well it worked. I know that a couple of them were going to go home and order one for themselves. I have yet to try this with anything more than a basic hot dog but I expect that it will work just as well from brauts, etc. Simple, yet a great product."
2,Gift,"This was a gift. they said it keeps the hotdogs from rolling allover the grill (or falling through), but other than that, it's nothing special."
1,Look Away,"The intention of this book was probably more profound. Its intention to draw any reader (non-voyeur or voyeur) into a world of voyeurism ... by framing each photograph with thick black borders, its intention was to convey as if we were there ""secretly"" peering and privy to a private and secret moment.Unfortunately, it fails on several levels. Of course, grainy low-res black and white photographs are an esthetic choice - in this case, the choice certainly does not add any value to this collection - but more importantly, it fails on the level that there's no real point to these photographs ... and no real message other than just a random series of photographs of a similar subject. With no artistic point or message, it's really just a series of grainy black and white, not-very-erotic photographs. All and all, a fairly pointless book."
2,Disappointed,The cover and bindings of this book are great. I love the black pages. The pictures are disappointing. All small black and white pictures that are underexposed. Not worth the Money. There are much better photographs out there. I didn't feel like I was a voyeur. I felt like I was looking at a bunch of poor quality photographs.
1,bad thing,"this thing is soooooo cool it works really well. when i took my first picture it took it soooooo fast! i only gave it a one becaues when i took my next picture the camera exploded in my face, killing my whole family!!!!!!!!!! dont get it!"
4,Really an overall workout!,I have Joanie Greggains step workout which is just ok. This Back Health workout is really very good. It is slow and easy to follow but forces you to watch technique. It incorporates a lot of abs and upper leg workout. The workout is about 30 minutes. There is a section at the end where a doctor talks about back health - I haven't watched that part. I thought this tape was well worth the money.
5,I love this video!,"I have used Joanie Greggains Back Health for several years. I'm afraid that I'm wearing it out and that it will just quit one day so I need to get a back-up replacement, just in case. It's safe and effective and I never get bored, it's just the right length for me."
1,actually hurt more than it helped,"We bought this video bacuse it cameo highly recommended. It could be that it should not be used for disk problems - I don't know. But, the exercises actually caused more back pain. After only using it twice, this one got shelved - too risky."
3,bug scope,My girls like this but I wish it was brighter for looking at bugs. None the less a good educational toy
4,Great product,my 3.5 year old loves this. It is stored in his outdoor toy bin and we walk around looking for bugs and leaves to look at under the scope.
2,"It was cheap, so what did I expect","This is a great idea, but the magnifier doesn't work well enough to hold the attention of my seven year old nephew. The images are fuzzy and only a little clear when dead center field. I was hopeful, but disappointed. We took it to a family reunion and just left it at the beach house when we went home because it just wasn't any good."
2,The instructions were not expilicit,"I was attempting to cook my burger, but it didnt come out well. It ended up smelling somewhat like fish. There were NO onion ring recipies. I also lit a small fire in my kitchen."
2,Darwin's Ghost : The Origin of Species Updated,"I read half of this book and gave up. I wondered why it was taking me so long to read, then I realized I was reading many sentences and paragraphs twice. Granted I'm not a Ph.D., this book shouldn't have been that difficult to read; for this, I might as well read Darwin's book. While some parts were complicated, I think the main problem of the book was that it was edited poorly. If you don't think punctation marks matter, give this book a read. Afterwards, you will praise an English teacher. On a good note, however, Jones did wonderful in the explanation department. I did learn a lot on his AIDS coverage. For a better yet simpler read on evolution, I recommend Richard Dawkins."
2,Ruined by Subtitle?,"Unfortunately, this is not an update to ""Origin of the Species,"" but a layperson's ""guide"" to developments in evolution biology. Darwin's own revisions and updates to Origin of Species, turned out to often be wrong. But he was a very good writer, and I was looking forward to an actual ""update"" (specifically of the first edition). To claim to be an update of such a historic work, and then present (apparently randomly) some odds and ends of the newer findings in evolution was, for me, unforgivable."
2,"Great subject, tough read","I've recently become very interested in theories of evolution and have read quite widely in this space. I can't recommend this book because, although its aims in bringing Darwin up to date are laudable, it is just too hard to read. Every fourth or fifth sentence you have to ask yourself ""just what is he really saying here?"" The style is almost wilfully difficult. Why struggle with such tough material when you can cover the same ground effortlessly with other authors such as Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett, both of whom write quite beautifully? Forget Darwin's Ghost, try Dawkins's ""The Blind Watchmaker"" or Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea."""
5,Evolution for Dummies (and Creationists),"Steve Jones, definitely proves his understanding of genetics and evolution by explaining some of the most complex theories and ideas in simple vernacular with precise examples and clear annecdotes. One of the most grasping books I've read. This is a hella-book."
2,Not a good read.,"I tend to agree with criticism presented in previous reviews.I found ""Darwin's Ghost"" (my first attempt to learn more about Darwin and recent progress on his evolution theory) rather difficult to read. Certain fragments are very interesting and even shocking to the layman (just for example: Earth's history, details about bacterias, ants, bees and behavior of cuckoos and other birds/animals). And OK, I understand: there is no charity in Nature, everything comes down to DNA, its mobility, exchange, transmittance, etc.(meaning DNA science is a key in today's research on evolution). However I had to struggle quite often over many sections of this text. Swamped by chaos of too many examples, ""Darwin's Ghost's"" huge disadvantage is a lack of 'Glossary of Scientific Terms' - a MUST for any popular science book!"
3,Inner Sanctuary,"Three decades after reading this novel, it is still one of my favorite of the genre. The inclusion of the blue goddess was disturbingly personal. The hero straddles two worlds, one high tech, the other archetypal inner space. Science fiction has long since morphed into space opera, and Zelazny seemed to be one of the first to breach the bubble of stories based purely on science and technology."
3,Preview first - I didn't like it,"I first heard Tara Leigh Cobble on a sampler disc. It was a song called, ""Regarding Miranda"" from Home Sweet Road. The song is really really good. There was a short review of Home Sweet Road in which the reviewer described Tara as beyond her age with this great ability to write some really good, really deep music. I thought that if her other material even compared to this song, I had someone to add to my favorites list. When I went to buy the CD, I saw that she had another CD, called beneath this skin. So, I bought both CD's. I was completely disappointed. I didn't hear one song on the two albums I liked other than ""Regarding Miranda"". I haven't heard her newer stuff. I'd be interested in checking it out. Anyway, the songs on these albums were just kind of silly and not noteworthy at all. I'm not saying don't buy. Just buy carefully. Try to sample the whole disc to find out what you are getting."
2,The Architecture of Humanism: A Study in the History of Tast,I read this book over thirty years ago when I was an architecture student at the University of Oregon and had a dificult time undestanding the text. I tried to read it again about ten years after graduation and couldn't develop any excitement or enthusiasm for the book. It is very difficult to understand and is written in somewhat tedious style.
5,Orion 13mm Stratus Eyepiece,"I so enjoyed the other Orion Stratus Eyepieces (24, 21, and 17mm) that I added it to the collection. I use the EP with my C8-SGT (f10) scope when I'm viewing Uranus and Neptune. Its also very good when I 2X barlow to look at Jupiter. It's also great for viewing Globular Clusters!!I will use it when Mars and Saturn are within view."
5,Great Eyepiece,"I may not be Edwin Hubble or Carl Sagan nor do I have the biggest and best scope in the world. But I do have a nice mid range scope in an Orion XT8 Dobsonian and this eyepiece along with the 13mm and the 8mm that I purchased are my favorites by far. Terrific field of view and very high quality. It may not be a Nagler but at a fraction of a Nagler price, it makes beautiful images in my eyes. Love it and highly recommend this. They are heavy by the way and just so you know, they are the same eyepieces as Baader Hyperions. Oh I also like the big mm numbers Orion has stenciled on the side of the eyepieces. Makes it much easier to see in the dark. Highly recommended."
2,Can't Learn,"I tried 2 of these and neither will learn more that 5 or 6 keys under one function. If you plan on teaching it up/down channel and the number keys . for example, it can't do it. It has a limit on the number of keys it can learn. I bought it to use on a comcast DTA, note their is no code for comcast equipment. It could learn a few keys, up down, so it is better than nothing but barely. Other than that Mrs Lincoln how did you like the play!"
5,very good choice.,"Excellent unit!All features work extremely well.When exiting my home after dark,allI have to do is start to step out the door and the light comes on.So far,the motion sensor has not turned the unit on unnecessarily."
3,Working well,"this lamp was easy to install and working well. My only issue is that is seems slow to respond when someone is walking up my drive way, but further research shows that the motion sensor works best with side to side motion not direct."
4,Smooth with ambience,"A great goth album. It's smooth, dark, and mysterious. It's not total metal, even though you'll hear a crunchy guitar interspersed here and there. There's some sampling and surreal sounds to it. This album is definitely a treat, even to those who want to be a bit diverse within the realm of hard metal and goth . This is a lighter one, but doesn't lack the darkness of harder bands. The lead singer has a soft voice that lends to the darkness of the music. Good stuff and highly recommended."
2,I had to sign for deodorant delivery?,"This product is perfectly fine, but I would be concerned about ordering from this seller, AmericanRx. The product was shipped USPS, took a very long time. Then I had to be at home to sign for the package. On top of everything else, the box the deodorant was in was smashed, so I'd say packing was pretty rough as well. Not worth the hassle."
2,Great sweat management but watch for your allergic reaction..,"Nothing could be more dry than this.. the only problem I have with it is that after few days of use I got strong rash on my arm pits, arms and chest.. I stopped using it and within few days the rash was gone.I will use again for another try (I don't give us easily)..."
5,My Underarms Thanked me.,"Okay, i use Sweat Shield wipes ( Amazing By the way ) but last night i didn't get to use it! so, busy all day - sweaty an miserable too... - I rush home and grab this from my Bureau... It has cooling relief and smells really amazing. Its an antiperspirant too but its like a regular one, but has more ODOR protection not as much Antiperspirant. Ive had Severe sweating since I was Nine. Terrible problem. I Feel Great now. Fresh and Cool, oh yeah and dont forget DRY!you won't even believe it!"
4,Better than the Big Co. Brands,This product worked better than any of the several brands that I purchased at discount stores and pharmacies over the counter. The well known companys are selling their prescription deodorants over the counter for about $7+. I tried them all and none worked. I am an average sized female. I do walk a lot during the day while working but nothing too strenuous but my regular deodorant just stopped working as well as I would like. I never have a problem when I use the Certain Dri Stick. My coworker was having the same problem but could not find this in any store (neither could I) so I order a stick to try & she loves it also. I also tried the Certain Dri 72 hour roll on. This is used at night but if you shower first it will irritate your skin. It works while you sleep. It has an AM roll on to be used with it. The roll ons are ok in the winter but I just prefer a solid stick during summer.
3,This is NOT the anit-perspirant product - this is the deodorant,This is NOT the anit-perspirant product - this is the deodorant. You need to have BOTH this A.M. to the Certain Dri which is used at night. The description should only say Deodorant. The antiperspirant is for night application. The A.M. product is the deodorant and you need the night time Certain Dri which is the antiperspirant for the real wetness problem.
3,Insoluble,"This product can be explained with one word:Insoluble. In-sol-u-ble. adj.1. incapable of being dissolved; incapable of forming a solution, esp in water.If you mix one scoop in 16 ounces of water, it still comes out with the consistency of oatmeal. If you are planning on mixing this product with a spoon, I wish you luck. It tastes pretty good and the price is definitely right, so I still give it 3/5."
3,Not convinced,"People were swearing all over workout forums that this was great tasting protein, and I beg to differ. It tastes just as ""bad"" as other bad mixes I've tried (cheap EAS mix comes to mind EAS-Premium Protein Powder, 5lb. bag). It only gets 3 stars for mixing great with a spoon and mixing fine with a shake. I'm still convinced Muscle Milk is the best tasting protein on the market; if only it had purer protein and less calories."
4,Great interpretations and song selection,"This is a really good recording. They've selected kewl pieces to put into this collection. The Porgy And Bess songs are instrumental only, like jazz, and are really fantastic. The rendition of Summertime is hauntingly fantastic, just a great piece."
1,Cheap plastic bowl,"I'm a single guy and I don't use the food processor all that much. I bought this to process dough, but then I discovered kneadless recipes and used it for bread only once. And with light use, the plastic work bowl broke in less than a year. I got it in March and it broke in November.And another thing...It's heavy and solid, and gives the impression that it's a sturdy and powerful machine. If it is, it's a waste. The design makes it messy to process more than a couple of cups at a time. When it's operational, this big bulky machine is no more useful than the little discolored plastic 20-year-old 2 cup processor that I am now going to have to recover from the basement junk bin."
5,Robust power but...,"...well, nothing really to complain in terms of quality, sleek design..but there's something to be said about the blade ""part"" in the big bowl. Some of you know what I'm talking about.Since you bought this 9-Cup exactly for its ability to store that much stuff, you'll definitely (most of the time) have enough content to maybe quarter fill it, and that's enough.Once you have that, when you decide to pull out that blade, you'll be creating a hole in the center and whatever that ""part"" was keeping in your bowl will now take its place outside the bowl.I read another review that mentioned this and once I learned the hard way, then I immediately thought of that assessment.Unfortunate since now I had to clean that sleek chrome -- and the counter. Not really a big deal but you just have to remember to pull it out once you've emptied quite a bit of stuff out."
4,Very pleased,"Very happy with the relatively little I've done:It does a better job of mixing pasta dough than my upright mixer. It will mince garlic at the micro level. Pureeing works fine. 9 cups seems like a very good size for home use. (I'd been struggling with a 5 cup B&D; chopper for some 10 odd years).I haven't used it for grating or slicing, but I'm sure it's fine at that. But real foodies are knife folk, no? Right tool for the right job...I'm very happy with this tool, that said."
5,"Great Price, Great Service","Great Product at a great price. Was delivered promptly in original packaging, was definitiely new."
2,Dang! If only the shred/slice blades worked better!,"I shred a lot of cabbage and this machine is LOUSY at shredding OR slicing. The attachements have a slightly lowered lip where everything gets stuck! The machine jumps all over the place with the centrifical force making this task impossible! It takes forever to shred since I have to stop the machine so many times to get it going again.Honestly, if this machine could grate/slice I would love it. The ""s"" blade works beautifully though! If all you do is use it for this purpose than this machine is fabulous. If you're planning on using it for anything else...good luck. And it's so expensive! You'd think you could use all of its functions."
1,Hard to open and close!,"The work bowl cover is very hard to open and close. The mini bowl is hard to take out. It works well once you overcome these, but I am disappointed in this machine."
3,Wrong one,This was a nice item but not the one I wanted and was returned for the 11 cup processor. Love that.
5,Love it,I love this food processor. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. I love the optional smaller bowl for smaller tasks. Looks good in the kitchen. Simple to use.
5,food processor,"I am very pleased with my KitchenAid 9 cup food processor. I have wanted one for many years, but just never got around to purchasing it. Now that I have it, I'm delighted with my new food processor."
5,"easy purchase, fast delivery, excellent product","This was sent as a gift to my son in a distant city. It arrived as described, promptly, in perfect condition, and he loves it. It is ideal for his smallish kitchen because it processes enough for small parties without taking over the counter space."
5,Excellent food processor,"This was a Christmas gift from my husband replacing a 23 year old food processor. I cook a lot and the KitchenAid (KFP740CR) 9-cup food processor is quite, powerful and clean up is a breeze. It comes with a little bowl that fits within the regular sized bowl for working with smaller quantities. I like that it can chop herbs without crushing them or making them 'mushy'. The bowls and lid design have simple lines and curves, without those little nooks and crannies that are difficult to clean. The ON, OFF and PULSE buttons are flat and sealed on the base....easy to use, easy to clean. I have other KitchenAid products which have lasted a very long time. I would reccommend this food processor."
5,Pleased with my purchase!,"I had never owned a food processor, although I've been married for 21 years and do lots of cooking. I had actually purchased a much cheaper Black & Decker model a few days before considering the Kitchen Aid, but after reading the book, packed it back up and returned it. I am so happy with the Kitchen Aid model. I have tried everything out on it, and it really works great. I know it will be used very frequently in my kitchen. I have to agree that you get what you pay for."
3,"Fast, but messy","This is the first full size food processor I've ever owned & it hasn't been quite the time saver that I thought it would be. It shreds, slices, & chops in just seconds which makes prep work go quickly, but I didn't expect the clean up to be so much work. And unlike some other reviewers, when I use the 4 cup bowl the large bowl needs cleaning too. I'll continue to use it for big prep work tasks & I plan to try making bread dough in it, but for smaller jobs I'm going back to using my knife & a little elbow grease."
5,Great product,"This processor replaced an older Cuisinart that had seen better days. My new processor is being used daily as I am slowly going to a raw diet. You'd be amazed what you can do with raw food and a processor. The most amazing thing I've done so far is process frozen bananas to make ""ice cream."".....pretty amazing. For my uses, a processor has to be very powerful, and this one is. I have also used it to make ""brownies."" Any less powerful processor would not have been able to handle the thick mass that became the brownies."
5,Successful purchase,"I ordered this item because the reviews were so favorable. This KA FP really is as good as they say. I previously bought (and returned)the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth which was terrible (short cord, too tall, impossible to clean, grated carrots very unevenly and huge chunks did not grate, cheese grater left cheese wedged between blade and plastic cover). I have no complaints about this product."
4,Great choice,"This processor is efficient, sturdy and reliable. I have used it for six weeks now and can attest that it can do nearly everything. The 4 cup mini bowel is convenient and easy to clean. Unlike some of the reviews I read, I never have had to clean the larger 9 cup bowel after using the mini. The only problem I encountered was learning not to overfill when I am pureeing with the larger bowel. Anyone preparing very large quantities may want to purchase the next size up. The bowels and cover are plastic but durable.This processor has a permanent location on my kitchen counter and I use it now nearly every day."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD,"So far, I like this product. Minor con: food gets up under the lip of the lip for some strange reason, but this is minor."
4,nice but big & clunky,This is a nice machine; but it is very heavy & not easy to move around. It does the job very nicely otherwise.
5,KitchenAid KFP740CR Processor,"I love, love, love this processor! It is really heavy duty, quite nice looking & works like a dream.I use it almost daily.I mostly use the small work bowl, but like having the large capacity for soups & larger volumefoods. You won't regret this purchase for the price on Amazon.Missouri G-Mom"
2,"Good consistency, but bad plastic","I bought this food processor for making my own baby food. I wish I'd done my research on the plastic parts first. Z Recs says, ""All KitchenAid food processors have bowls and lids made of polycarbonate, and thus contain BPA"" (http://www.zrecommends.com/detail/bpa-pvc-and-phthalates-in-food-processors-and-blenders/). Not quite the health-conscious vision I had in mind when I set out to make my own food.The food processor has done a great job so far of making the baby food to an even consistency, so if you're not concerned with BPA, I'd recommend it. I don't feel comfortable using it for baby food (or any hot food) any more, however, and am going to look for an alternative."
2,"liquid spills all over, can only work with dry ingredients","It has to be reserved for all dry ingredients only. No sauces, no salsa, no liquid. That's it - spills is the main reason for me looking for a replacement. I used a gift card to buy this one, so no money lost, but in 6 years of having it I only used it 12-20 times max. And I love to cook and would love to use it more. But I dread the spills and cleanup. I tried so many times to remove/lift the large bowl without a spill - no luck. Even before you try to lift it, while you are chopping stuff -- if there is a tiny amount of liquid it will find its way out the middle tube and down the base and on the counter. The small bowl is hard to lift up without either getting your fingers in the food or having stuff fall into the large bowl."
2,Flawed Design,"KitchenAid KFP740CR 9-Cup Food Processor with 4-Cup Mini Bowl, ChromeThis processor looks great sitting on the counter, but what a disappointment! When liquid ingredients or ingredients that will liquify while being processed (eggs and butter come to mind), a mess is inevitable because of two design flaws:1. The bowl cover is designed to fit over (on the outside) of the bowl so that liquid that splashes up to the top will drip outside the bowl and onto the counter when the cover is removed.2. The center wall of the bowl encircling the power shaft covers only one-third of the shaft, so liquid oozes over the shallow wall onto the power shaft. When the bowl is lifted off of the base, liquid leaks out onto the power shaft and base and counter.My previous processor had a cover that fit inside the bowl and a center wall that extended the full lenghth of the power shaft, hence no leakage problems."
5,Perfect Food Processor,I love this thing! It is really easy to use and clean. I have been making vegetable and fruit purees to use in recipes for my family and I have only needed the 4-cup mini bowl. Soon I will make larger batches of baby food and other stuff to freeze with the larger part. It is really sturdy and makes my kitchen look like I actually know what I am doing.
2,Beware--Customer Service Doesn't Cut It!,"We bought this one about 2 years ago. It worked fine with light use, however, I recently called customer service, thinking it was broken. The representative didn't want to help me try to figure what was wrong. Since it was out of warranty (1 year for this pricy processor), KitchenAid wouldn't fix it. The rep suggested I bring it or ship it to an authorized repair place. I live in Houston, Texas, one of the largest metro areas in the county. And the nearest KitchenAid repair place is 300 miles away! The rep basically said I was on my own and told me to find a local appliance repair shop.As it turns out (thank you hubby!) once in a while the parts don't lock into place, and it may seem like it doesn't work. Mea culpa. It's working again.Bottom line, my experience with KitchenAid's customer service and repair options was very disappointing, especially considering how expensive their appliances are. Won't buy from them again."
4,i love it except for one little pesky problem.,i love that it is sturdy and almost silent when in use. i have not found one job this food processor cannot handle. i made the best salsa yet. the pulse really chops without making things a pulpy mess. my one dislike is it does not hold much liquid. to make my salsa is an extra step because the little spout in the middle is only about 3 inches high and is easy to have a big spill. i have found if i leave the chopper blade in and just loosen and lift and pour quickly not as much spills through the hole. this is made shorter to hold the mini chopping bowl. the speed of receiving my order was fantastic. i would recommend this to my friends and i have but with the warning watch for liquid item overflow.
5,It's great!,This is my 2nd 9 cup KitchenAid food processor. The first lasted 15 years and the only reason I'm purchasing a new one is that a tiny piece which locks the lid broke off and I can no longer get a lid replacement. I love this processor and use it for so many things. With 15 years of use I'd say I've definitely gotten my money's worth!
4,Spot filter for Kodak DX 7590,"Using an adapter for 55mm lenses, many effects can be used on this camera. However this is one that is tricky because of the distance from the lense face to the spot filter. The only way to get the softened edge effect is to zoom half way to full zoom. This somewhat defeats the portraiture it was purchased for. Without zoom a circle with no soft edges is all you get.So, this is not a good buy for this camera."
4,pretty but not very many rainbows,"this is nice for the price but it didn't produce more than a few small rainbows, which is the reason I bought it. from now on I think I'll stick with buying prisms that have more edges..."
2,Fair Light Show,This is a relatively small prism in terms of overall size and cuts. It has to be positioned just so in order to get a decent reflection.
3,Disappointing,"Very small and delicate and lightweight--- It was not what I expected, but my expectations were probably unfounded. No packaging issues; no chips; but also no dazzle. I will keep them, but I will also be ordering something larger."
1,Avoid this book,"I bought this book hoping for some real insight into the world of Thoroughbred racing from the history and allure of the breed to the off limits world of the backstretch. Given the authors credentials, one might think that that's what you'd get. This book, however, is the most self indulgent, cloying piece of pap ever put to paper. This book reads more like a teenage drama queen's diary than a satisfying chronicle of The Sport of Kings. The only reason to buy this book would be the picture on the cover; it's phenomenal. Unfortunately, the photographer wasn't involved with writing the book."
2,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"I thought the title was a somewhat missleading. If your looking to get some insight into thoroughbred racing this is not the place to look. There are some points of intrest and humor. For the most part it is about how the author views the world of thoughbreds and horse racing, which is a view that is not all that interesting. To me she came off as a person that loves horses, but is not quite sure if she like horseracing or the racetrack."
2,I had to put it down...,"This book is so full of useless, flowery writing that I just couldn't take it anymore. Her method of description is simply annoying. Not only that... every chapter begins with lame stories of May May, Nan's grandmother, that just about drove me crazy."
3,Title says it all,"I guess when you see a title, ""My Racing Heart"" you should know you won't get any meaniful information. I mean, when you have chapters about handicapping I would like to see more substance than betting with your heart! If you're interested soley reading about one person's passion with thoroughbred racing, you struck gold. Maybe it would be nice to include some useful things one has learned through the years with one's passion. Moral of the book, just have fun."
3,miter case,"wonderfullly fitting case. only one problem.....no cushion/quilting/protection from being bumped/dropped. if they ask, tell them to build next one with some foam in it ."
5,WOW! Too GREAT!!!,"This c.d. is amazing! I've had it for a while but I've never been tired of it! I love ""Rock DJ"", ""Kids"" with Kylie Minogue (check her out too!) & ""Road To Mandalay"".With a video for ""Rock DJ"" (beware, if you can't take stripping to the EXTREME! don't watch it! Clothes & skin go!) this album is great!"
3,Third Effort From Mr Ego.,"The Third effort by the Robbie/ Guy Chambers writing partnership see's a more mature progression not in terms of quality but in more advanced arrangements and styles. The only problem I have with the album is I personally believe that there is a tendancy to over produce such artist like Robbie Williams with fancy sounds and other still tricks I'd like to see such an artist do a raw album of great performances, but then again that doesn't sell....does it?"
4,lots of fun,"I knew I had to have this CD when I was in England and heard Rock DJ on the radio. I couldn't find it anywhere though and had to wait until it came out in the states several months later. Strangely enough, the first time I played this CD all the way through it didn't really hit me. But I gave it another spin and it's become one of my favorites. I would definitely recommend this CD! 4 Stars!!"
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Ego Has Landed"" so much that it seemed that I always took it everywhere. This new cd disappointed me. like many other people that reviewed this, I agree that you should listen to it before buying it.I watched the specials on BBCAmerica about the making of this latest cd and it made me want to buy this one. Advertising at its finest. I loved every song on the first cd but I have found a few that I could do without on this cd. Some just seemed like they were thrown in to take up space. It seemed very 70's pop/disco oriented. I'll probably put ""EGO"" back in the player and this one on the shelf.The video of 'Rock DJ' was good until the scenes liken to 'Night of the living dead' meets roller disco.I just wasn't impressed. I expected more from someone so talented. The pictures in the cd amused me more."
2,Doesn't transfer well to the USA,"Like ABBA, Robbie Williams is a Euro-megaphenomenon who doesn't cross the Atlantic that well. It isn't that we think he is terrible; we just don't hear or see anything to get excited about. His cheekiness is best understood/appreciated/loved by Brits. The music seems a bit - contrived and plastic. True, Williams doesn't take himself too seriously but we can't appreciate him being tongue-in-cheek/half-sincere without knowing the man as well as the Brits, who have seen him grow from boy band member to solo act. Most Americans have never seen him and couldn't pick him out of a line-up. If he wants to conquer America, he needs to hit the road and introduce himself to us Yanks on TV and stage."
5,Pop Music for Grownups,"I think I'm the only American Robbie Williams fans -- sadly most American's just don't understand him. Amazing that idiots like Ashley Simpson and the Backstreet Boys (who aren't even capable of writing their own music) sell millions, but Robbie doesn't catch. Sure he's a little vulgar, but it's entertaining. He's certainly no Beatles, Stones, Pink Floyd, or Led Zeppelin, but it's just FUN music (often with a mocking element). Americans, give him a chance ... I truly don't think you'll be dissapointed."
3,"A couple of good tunes, but that's about it","I was so excited when I first received this CD, but it got old really fast... Sounded like some old George Michael tunes from the '80s. Don't waste your time."
5,Five stars no doubt,"In old days I was a rock fan and didn't like any music that sounded like pop. Nowadays I am not so extreme anymore. This album is really good. Though a little bit worse that ""I've been expectin you"", but still five stars."
5,Another Winner,"Another great album from Robbie Williams! On the first listen I wasn't too sure about it, but after a couple of listens it is definitely a new favorite of mine. ""Kids"" with Kylie Minogue is this album's weak point, but the other songs are great. If you are a true Robbie fan you'll love this. An excellent addition to any Robbie Williams collection!"
3,The Ego is still enjoyable,"Robbie Williams proclaimed his coming to the masses with ""The Ego Has Landed,"" but he actually has gotten better with his newest, ""Sing When You're Winning."" A typical britpop album that, love it or hate it, has the gem of a song, Rock DJ. The enhanced CD includes the disturbingly humourous video of this song in which Robbie rips his body down the a barebones skeleton to attract the attention of the female DJ in the video. Other standout tracks include ""Singing for the Lonely,"" ""Knutsford City Limits,"" and ""Let Love Be Your Energy."" An enjoyable one for the true britpop fan."
3,no quite Angel-ic.,"To say the least, I've been rather disappointed with Robbie Williams' US releases. He's even started rapping on this album. Robbie Williams has one helluva voice that should not be wasted. Sting already made that err on one of his later releases where he had a French rapper do some impromptu lines.Nonetheless this album is still worthy of 3 stars because there are some ballads on it that save the album from complete disaster. ""Better Man"", ""Love Calling Earth"" and ""If It's Hurting You"" are the better mellow songs that are good for Magnolia-esque moods and they do show some maturity in voice and lyrics since his last album.All the other songs are nothing close to spectacular. But then again, there wasn't all that much on ""the Ego has Landed"" besides ""Millenium"" and ""Angel"". I expect a lot more from a talent such as he."
4,Robbie... Robbie....,"Again Robbie bogs us into the world of controversy. The video Rock DJ is sexually gory and you have to tolerate the nude escapades Robbie did on Vogue UK and in the album inlay.... Yes, you girls get this album for the nude pictures of Robbie. Controversy aside this is a damn good album... Not commercial sounding like his earlier Take That albums and not to snobbishly rockish... And my Spinning Around Kylie is greaaat tooo... Hope Robbie and Kylie get married and have pooooppish Kids."
3,Sing when you're losing,"While there are a couple of good songs on this record it will not go down in history as one of Robbie Williams best. ""Rock DJ"" and ""Road to Mandalay"" are the two strongest songs on the album. Seek out his first two import releases for Robbies best work!"
1,Yawn! BORING!,"Ho-hum. Do people really like this kind of non-musical music, with pandering lyrics and sophomoric delivery? Take That, Robbie! Go on back. Gary Barlow at least puts melodies in his songs! And the arrangements are so tinny and irritating.Sorry, fans, this one's just for you!"
3,its ok,"This book is alright, got it based on a requirement for a lower level English lit class. Read through most of it in a single sitting (its really short). The book covers a wide gamut of Gothic literature, but doesn't get into too much detail. Its not a waste of money if you need it for a class, it IS however a waste of money if you seek deeper knowledge of the field of Gothic lit beyond just a simple introduction."
4,Freightliner Trucks 1937-1981,"Book is very informative. Has lots of great old factory photos. The book really focuses on the 50' and 60's. It really covers very little on the 70's, which is what I was looking for."
1,NEED NEWER VERSION,"I purchased this item on February 17, 2011, and it is not the version I need. I need a newer version, but can not find it anywhere. Can anyone please help me ?!?"
1,Myst V is terrible,"A fraud, if you will. Loved all the previous Myst games. This was made by a different group with much lesser standards, talent and budget. The last hurrah cash in. Sad for all those looking forward to it. Sad for the people who made the previous versions"
1,Heartbroken,"Amazon forces you to put stars on a review, but this game deserves less than zero. I know I'm not saying anything that the other reviews haven't said, but this game actually hurt.I've played all of the Myst games except URU which won't run on a Mac. Then I had a kid; he's four, and he sits next to me and plays them too, so playing Myst has become an intergenerational meaningful experience......which Myst V completely destroyed. It is SO bad that I feel like Cyan has robbed me of the enjoyment of doing something fun with my kid. It is a betrayal of everything that the earlier games excelled at. I'm heartbroken, truly pained."
3,Myst End of Ages,"All the Myst games are considered a puzzle game or strategy game. If you need a lot of action, point and shoot, these games are not for you. But if you like puzzles and finding hidden clues you will enjoy Myst. The graphics are good but not great."
3,Such an anti-climactic end...,"I was SO looking forward to this game, after Myst IV : Revelation brought the series back in focus after the absolutely DISMAL release of URU (what WERE they thinking?). Unfotunately, after just a day and a half, I've already finished this afterthought of a game! It's more of an epilogue of Myst IV(what happened to Yeesha, etc.), than a full game on it's own. I'd say that the biggest beef I have is that the ages were WAY too short! I finished more than 3/4 of the whole game the first night! The puzzles weren't that hard, for even a remotely experienced adventure gamer; for those familiar with the series, very predictable. I still have to say that as an overall game, Exile: Myst III is by far the best. My advice to you is wait until it drops in price to play...or find a friend with it and borrow it..."
3,Very Dissapointed,"Knowing this would be the last chapter to the Myst series, I was hoping it's creators would come through with the most beautiful and immersive worlds yet.The graphis were extremely underdeveloped. The worlds were not as immersive because the worlds did not look real for the most part, trees looked like playdough rolled in ash, and the graphics had the choppy egdes which come with underdeveloped animation.I was also dissapointed that we do not get to see Atrus throughout the entire game and Yeesha was, i'm sorry, a jerk. From being about ten or eleven in Revelations to now being in her mid fourties was not a pleasent switch.Also they took out the actors and replaced them with 3D characters, although I was impressed with the facials of the characters, (but I myself have been quite used to playing games that were voiced over in english from the japanese version). The actors in the past games were a feature I loved about the games and set them apart from regular computer games."
3,A Myst Opportunity,"Esher said it best, ""A Myst Opportunity.""I loved the freely explorable interactive worlds. It cost them a bit in photorealism, but I think it was worth it to be able to look and walk around. I also liked the great shaft in the beginning. The tablet handwriting recognition was slightly flaky, but I liked the novelty.I disliked the story, the linearity, and the small size of the worlds. The story was mysticism and emotional drama with very little plot holding it up. The worlds remind me of Mario, you go in one direction, past the obstacles, and come out the end. And if Myst V were Mario, the worlds would be two screens wide.Unfortunately, when you take out the exploratory nature of the worlds and pay little attention to plot, what you don't get is Myst. You get an ok game worth playing, but not Myst.Myst IV: Revelations is really the last great Myst game."
2,Ubisoft Myst the Mark on this one,"A BAD, SAD end to a great series! Myst V is the absoulte worst of the bunch. The game seems as if it was built in a rush by third stringers using leftovers from URU and Myst 1. The puzzles are lame and the graphics poor with detail, clickable or otherwise, minimal and no interactive video. Worst of all seems to be the poor quality control: I have run all the Myst Games as well as URU on the same machine and only with Myst V did I have so many technical problems, including a Crashed Hard drive.The only good Part was David Ogden Stiers as the voice of Esher and, of course, Atreus."
3,"Buy it if you must finish the series, but don't expect too much","I've very much enjoyed playing all the other Myst games, and by the end felt somewhat triumphant for having figured everything out. They all had pretty good story lines and the puzzles were challenging. I was excited to get End of Ages to once again figure out challenges, tax my brain, etc. In the end, I was rather disappointed. The puzzles really weren't as hard they were in some of the other games. I was able to move rather quickly through it (with just a couple of snags) and then came upon a rather quick and anticlimactic ending. I also preferred the real actors to the animated people that replaced them.BOTTOM LINE: I still would've purchased this game and played it just so I could finish out the series. If you are a Myst fan, but don't feel so compelled to finish it like I did, don't bother with this one. I can't recommend a mediocre game."
4,Still playing. good overall game.,"good game. playing this now. and sure is hard to figure out a little, but still like the scenery and game play. is remarkable game that they have made. like it so far. but could be better. still not sure if buying it. I borrowed from library. got for 2 weeks to do this. hope I make it through. I'm sure I will. uru only took 15 hours. good game try it. in the middle now.."
3,What Happened?,"I've been a fan of Myst games since the original came out years, and years ago. I can honestly say that I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of the last installment of my beloved game. The graphics were quite poor, and the level of difficulty was pathetic. the word ""Easy"" doesn't quite paint an accurate picture.This installment was trying to emulate Uru, but Uru was head and shoulders above Myst V. Uru had twice as much detail, and is notoriously more difficult. It's a shame that Myst V had to follow Myst IV, because Myst IV was the most beautiful game ever. If you haven't played Myst IV, please put that on your to-do list.Yet, this game is a must for Myst fans, and it is necessary to suffer through it. I know the Myst project has ended, but I can only hope that Ubisoft or cyan will resurrect Myst or Uru and redeem itself. We all know that this could have been a spectacular ending, and we were all pretty disappointed."
3,Less than Myst-ified!,"A lil bit disappointing, too much video of the characters talking. I just don't think watching them shuffle around while talking to me helps keep my attention in the game. Other than that it is a good game!"
1,Amazon can't get this right,"I ordered this item - twice - for Windows. Twice Amazon shipped me the MAC version, and refuses to believe that I didn't order the wrong thing. The picture and the description said Windows version when I ordered it. They can't get it right, so I can't say how good the game is or not. Just a warning, if you want to purchase this game and think you're getting what the picture shows."
5,A fine young game...,"Myst V is better than Myst IV, because although there is a ""time"" aspect to the puzzles, they aren't as miserably hard as those in Myst IV. Todelmer."
3,"It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either.","Certainly, this was a step backward from Myst IV. I knew it was going to be a step back when I saw it was only 1 DVD-ROM when Myst IV was 2 DVD-ROMs.The puzzles were there. Some of them better than others. While some were logically challenging, some of the controls were confusing, that is you could turn something, but not see any real on-screen indication of what was really going on. I didn't really get a sense of satisfaction upon completing a world, or the game for all things.Writing on the tablets was fun, and I don't agree with the comments that the game couldn't recognize what you wrote. Even I, a really bad artist had very few instances where the game didn't accept what I had drawn.In all, it kept me entertained and going back until I had completed it. Not my favorite in the Myst series though."
3,Beat the clock!,"A new and irritating aspect of Myst V are puzzles that must be solved before your 'timer' runs out. Different puzzles have different 'timers' but the plays the same - set the timer, try to solve the puzzle, if not then go through the whole process again of resetting the timer. Grrr... This really detracts from the classic Myst experence - it turns it into an action game. The game is worth purchasing but be prepared for aggravation not relaxation."
1,Wrecked my PC,"The game froze my harddrive; I reformtted, only to have my PC ffreeze again when I tried the second time. I bought two Cyan games, and can't play. What a waste of money!"
1,BORING!!!,"This video is terribly boring. It is extremely repetitious and very slow, without any 'fun' elements to make it enjoyable.My 17 month old loves some of the other 'learning' videos - such as the Baby Einstein videos and Titzer's 'Your Baby Can Read!', and gets really excited when they start. But she barely watches this one - and who can blame her - I couldn't wait for it to be over when I watched it with her!A much better way to teach your baby to count is to count with her throughout the day - count buttons when you dress her, count all the flowers on a page in a book, etc."
5,Strong international content,"The 2nd edition of this book preserves all the best qualities of the original edition while adding considerably to its international content. New chapters have been added, including discussion on high-performance organizations, knowledge management, international legislative frameworks, human capital, HRM in smaller organizations, entrepreneurship, pay and compensation, work-life balance, employee involvement and stress. Numerous case studies and examples are taken from Australia, Canada, South Africa, Asia and Europe as well as the UK and US. All-in-all, a more balanced and authoritative, general HR textbook than the first edition but still uniquely focused on HR in its business context."
3,Go Go,"I love Chuck. However, this was not his best work. I feel he was trying to be like the young kids today. Chuck can be much better than this. This CD is only okay...."
3,Disappointed,"As everyone knows (or should know), Chuck Brown is the Godfather of go-go. But unlike ""I Need Money"" and ""Bustin' Loose"", this CD seems too slick and overproduced. It's more like a tribute than something with an edge. P.S. Anyone in search of more go-go should check out the Liaison Records catalog."
5,karl lagerfeld diet,"this book is amazing. i bought 4, as the diet worked so well, i gave it to all my friends"
4,"200+ pages of book, <17 of Diet.","This book is not really what I expected. From reading other readers' reviews I knew a bit what to anticipate, but I did think there would be a bit more sustenance. I'm a big Karl Lagerfeld fan, so it was money well spent, but the point of the book, like any other diet, is to turn attention to what you're really eating. There are only 17 pages of actual diet planning, the rest is a slew of sidenotes.The supplements are pretty pricey, and hard to pin down exactly what you need. Interesting book though, I'm happy with it."
3,The Best Thing About This Book,"The best thing about this book is that we get to see pictures of what Karl Lagerfeld looked like when he was young and handsome, before he got that strange little gray ponytail and the tinted sunglasses. You KNOW what I'm talking about. The diet isn't so much rigorous as it is regimented and you have to buy the doctor's supplements as well. Get the book for the pictures of Monsieur Lagerfeld, eat healthily, and ignore the rest."
3,Amusing,"Uncle Karl clearly dropped a significant amount of weight. Was it strictly diet and exercise or might there been a little bariatric surgery involved? Regardless, he looks healthy, and he's now able to get into the men's sample sizes he covets. I bought this book more or less as a curiosity. My curiosity is now satisfied. Next."
4,"Entertaining, but not for serious diet consideration","If you're a Karl Lagerfeld fan, this book is a must-have for your collection. The ""diet"" parts are a bit vague, with references to KL's specific line of supplements. Karl is delightful, and this comes through in his writing."
5,Nothing less could be expected from KL,"The book gets straight to the point with KL in the lead. He wants to let you know he was ready for a change and he did just that. He had his doctor lead him along the way to successfully losing ninety-some pounds! This is not for the soft of heart, this is for the person ready to make a change in their diet for life. It is how to get back on track, not just physically, but mentally as well. KL and his doctor help lead you through the truths of dieting and how you can make your life better. A great read and great way of life to follow."
1,Biggest crock of crap ever written,Don't waste your time or your $$$. This guy simply compiled a bunch of nonsensical crap and wrote a book. He's an exceptionally lousy writer and doesn't know the first thing about nutrition or weight loss. You may as well just buy a tapeworm to lose weight -- way more effective and just as healthy as his Rx diet. AVOID!
2,Too Basic,"The book certainly has the basics, but it also leaves out information that almost anyone building a deck will encounter. If everything goes perfectly, this book will do, but it doesn't help you when things aren't ideal."
1,Rock N Roll Reunion 61',"The songs included are not the original versions; instead, they are newly recorded takes by the original artists. Unsurprisingly, there is never an instance in which a new version tops the original, so the whole series should be avoided."
4,Dark shadows...,"The author delves into the psyche of the two main characters, Sarah and Brandon. The trials they face dealing with issues of trust, secrecy and deception torture them as they go through a journey of healing and self discovery.An excellent read for anyone who has ever had to deal with the pain of holding on to a dark secret that, if found out, could alter the course of their life."
4,A Great Read,"Sarah is providing in home care for Brandon who recently had an accident.Life is not easy, he is a difficult man.Sarah is attracted to him and soon realized that the accident is not the only thing bothering him.However, he kept it a secret.she had vowed to remain single, because of past experiences, but soon found herself in a world of forbidden love.Though Brandon was engaged to Stacey, sarah was the one he loved and trusted.Sarah, too, had her share of secrets, things that she is terribly ashamed of.Though she had come a long way, there were certain things that she did not want Brandon to know.When sarah discovered what was haunting Brandon, she was devastated. It also meant the end of their relationship.Would he ever be able to forgive her?The characters are lively, people with qualities and faults,real.I am a Nora Roberts, Mary Jo Putney's fan.I started this book and finished it in two days.It's a great read."
1,wanted bad,Couldn't wait for this product but it kept getting damaged during shipping.Good idea but not good for mail order.Shipped 4 times and 4 times damaged.
5,Best rolling pin.,This is a favorite of mine for making roll out cookies. It keeps them uniform and makes the job easier. If I had any complaints it would be the difficulty in changing the size disks. It is a bit tricky to get the rubber holder off as it needs to fit tight by design.
4,Treading Water for the Series,"Months after reading the rest of the books, I finally found my copy and re-read it. A simple opinion of the book is this:It is simply a transitional book, with no real impact of its own.The book wraps up previous plots (Toby in Washington, Sierra oil skullduggery, Janessa's doctoring, etc.) Outside of Janessa's involvment with birth control, no new plots are devised, and the plot concerning Frank is simply stretched into the Yukon, but lacks much of the feel for the territory.Ross already knew he wanted the next book to be heavily around the Spanish-American War,a nd simply sacrificed this book to get us there.WHat a shame."
4,Good Book,"Good book, part of a series of ten books, good author, have read several of her books, I enjoyed all of them"
4,Great tea,"This tea is easy to brew, doesn't have any bitter aftertaste, and is sweet without being overly so or needing extra sugar or honey added. Smells great in the package as well."
5,Love it!,"I bought this tea because I was looking for red tea (Rooibos) for its healthy properties and also because it is naturally caffeine free. This tea has a lot of antioxidants but does not taste healthy at all, it is more like a herbal tea when you want something sweet (I do not add any sugar to it). At the beggining I thought the taste was a little artificial, because in other flavored teas you cannot feel the fruit taste, but if you are looking for a flavored tea where you can really taste the other flavor, this is it. I love it and my 6 packages are almost gone."
4,Good tea,"I enjoyed all of these, but I kind of wish I didn't order so many of the variety - there are a few I like best and I've had to open all the boxes to get to those few."
2,Disappointing,"I really was looking for Rooibos tea but got distracted by the nice packaging and name. Actually didn't realize (duh!) until I got the order of 6-packs that these taste more of berries than rooibos. Not my cup of tea, I guess!"
3,"Fits, but NOT THE ONE IN THE IMAGE","I ordered a QUANTARAY lens cap and, at the very least, expected to be holding the same product as in the image.Instead, I received a ""Bower Pro Series II Snap Lens Cap(62mm). Although, they are one of the few sellers that sent me a copy of the invoice and an extra note telling me about their business and how to reach them if I am unsatisfied.I'm a little irritated that I did not get the same one as I was envisioning, but the one they sent me DOES fit and comes with a lens cap tether.I would rate higher, but I did not get the product I thought I would.This is the one I was sent instead:[...]"
1,"False advertising - this is a single pack, not a twin pack","There is a listing error for this item - it is a single pack, not a twin pack. When I wrote the vendor to ask about where the second cartridge was, they rudely replied that one is all I get, regardless of their incorrect listing. This error is current as of 3/13/10 - not sure if it will be fixed in the future, but until then, buyer beware."
2,Stay away from refurbished cartridges,"This was my first experience buying a refurbished ink cartridge....and it'll be my last. I bought them strictly to save money hoping that the quality of the pictures I print wouldn't suffer. Unfortunately the print quality was terrible. Reds and blues all appear washed out. They're so bad I won't even put them on the fridge, never mind about framing them. Oh well, back to the overpriced HP originals."
3,Solid craftmanship,"The best I can say about this book is that it is wonderfully written. Hijuelos definitely is one of the best contemporary writers in America. Yet in this book he lacks his usual pace. Having read every one of his books, I must say this one was a bit disappointing. It has great lengths which could have been avoided. The fictous life story of Israel Levis also paints a picture of Cuba before Castro, which very few of us know about. Nevertheless it lacks a lot of substance. On some occasions - unfortunately - I had to drag myself through this book. I would not read it again, which I did several times with ""Mambo Kings""."
2,contrived and flat,"We read this novel for Book Club, and all agreed that it did not live up to the glowing reviews. The characters were flat and unbelievable, the plot contrived. It's not that the situation could not have happened, but rather that the author wrote it clumsily, so that it did not come across as believable. In fact the heavy and clumsy writing detracted considerably from enjoyment of the book. The ""subtitles"" and translations in parentheses were quite annoying. None of us felt that there was any literary quality to the novel; it seemed more that Hijuelos was coasting on his reputation. If you want to read it, try the library first--I wouldn't recommend spending money on it."
4,A Simple Habana Melody,"It is a wonderful rare treat when an author keeps me anxiously, deliciously turning the pages. Page turners are usually associated with action or horror novels. What a treat to find such a wonderful lyrical tale. Now I must read ""The Mambo Kings"" Bravo, Mr. Hijuelos!"
2,Never really knew where the book was going.,From the first page of this book I couldn't figure out where it was going. It reminded me of film noir only in book form. I had a difficult time keeping track of everyone but the main character. I was looking forward to reading this and normally if I like a book I read everything else written by the author. I just could not get into this book and will not read anything more by this author. I suppose if you like this type of book you will enjoy it but i just never did enjoy it. Not even worth the few pennies I paid for this.
3,Blue Eyes,"Blue Eyes is first in a series of pulp mystery classics revolving around Detective Manfred Coen. This story takes place in NYC's seedy underbelly in the 1970's. I felt like the story was definitely dated and some of the jargon was none I'd ever heard of. On the one hand, I liked the vintage setting, on the other hand, due to the racial slurs, not so much. This almost reminded me of the film Pulp Fiction.The cast of characters was interesting and the suspense was good as well. There's a no good ping pong parlor, yep, and a human trafficking ring involved in the storyline as Blue Eyes Coen tries to find the missing daughter of a porn director.This is a quick read, and I'd recommend it to fans of pulp mysteries."
1,They did not ship the jacket in the picture....,The jacket itself its well made. BUT they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture...
5,Outstanding Music!!!,"This CD shows Myriam's best music that she performed in the first ""La Academia."" The song ""El Me Mintio"" stands out the most. She shows such great emotion and talent. I like her music so much that I hear it everyday. BUY IT, it's totally worth it."
4,Very cute,"This was a very cute product. The numbers did not adhere as well as I had hoped, but all-in-all it was well worth the money."
3,Great deal- fun filter,"Being a college student just getting into photography as a hobby it's hard to find cheap filters on a budget. Thus far I have no complaints and it works as it should. The effects are fun and it brings an extra level of cheesiness to the photo. However, it's not something I'd keep forever."
5,"Quality,Fast Service,Low Price",I have waited to fill out this review.I have use this lens at night time as well as for Portrait use.1- Cost of this lens is what made me buy.2- Postage was fair. (with email update)3- Come in a well packaged box!4- Arived Long before any other items I ordered from other Online Outlets.5- Will and have ordered from this Company!Thank You !Don
4,A Solid Old Testament Survey,"I completed this 300 pager a couple of years ago because it is required reading for an online class that I took at Colorado Christian University. As the title says, An Historical Survey of the Old Testament is a comprehensive but concise study of the first 39 books of the Bible. It's a book I should have read long ago and a great addition to the library. I do not see myself going back and reading the entire book again, but I can definitely see myself flipping through it for it a quick answer. A few of the perspectives were new to me and have aided my teaching."
4,Information worth knowing,The information in the book made for a better understanding of Biblical happenings within a historical context. The author left religious doctrine for the theologians but was very supportive of archeological findings and their support of history within the Biblical context. This text was an interesting and easily understood reading; an excellent handbook for any student seeking confirmation of factual happenings for their Bible stories.
3,Pages blank,I was not very happy with this book. I found random blank pages through out the book. I was missing over 16 pages and this was for a college class so it made answering some of the questions difficult. I wonder if the book was part of a discounted batch because of the missing or blank pages?
1,Bad Seller-Don't know about the book,"I never received the book, that I ordered on 2-19-09. I emailed the seller a few times w/o a response and I recently filed a claim and right now I am not a very happy person. I wish I could commit on the book.Thanks Kerri G."
1,Frustrating for young and old,"I bought this book to share with my 3-year-old granddaughter, as she loves both puzzles and animals. The puzzle pieces are sweet, and each pair has a different texture to feel. However, they (of course) fall out as the pages are turned, which causes her sorrow and grief, and then trying to put the pieces back in the little case is very frustrating, as they can only go in one way, and some have to be inserted upside down to fit correctly. A forgettable experience for both of us."
3,colgate fluoride coating floss,This cleans your teeth well but is hard to hold on to since it's slippery. It's also harder to floss with because it's almost impossible to get a steady rubbing motion going between your teeth. Perhaps the slipperiness has to do with the fluoride coating. It will not break easily but requires more patience than conventional dental floss.
1,Misleading title and jacket,"This book is not at all what it seems. The Mapmaker's wife, Isabel, whom the story is supposed to be about, does not really enter the plot until page 200. If you like math and the history of how the world's shape was calculated, this journal-like book is for you. If you are looking for a story and character development, make sure to pass this one up."
4,A history book whose story kept me reading,"I was very surprised by this book. First off, I loved it. It was hard for me to put it down. I was a bit skeptical by the sub title ""A true tale of love..."" However I was pleasantly surprised when much of the book turned out to be a wonderful history -- a narrative history -- of science, exploration, adventure, and adversity. Whitaker has woven a history book that was neither dull nor boring. I wish the history books I read in school were more like this.Why 4 out of 5 stars? Because I felt a bit ""cheated"" by the title. I know I said I was skeptical of the title at first. But while reading the book I kept wondering when the title would come to be part of the story. It seemed to me that this aspect of the history was a bit rushed and concluded rather abruptly."
4,Fascinating bit of history,"I've spent considerable time in Ecuador and know most of the places mentioned first hand so I was primed for good story. I wasn't disappointed.These were the days of full contact scientific inquiry, despotic colonial rule, fickle court bureaucracy and mundane violence.It is as much about the French scientific expedition as it is about the heroine's incredible adventure and almost tragic end but this is not a weakness. The action is seldom if ever slam bang but there is definitely enough happening to carry your interest. The alternating backdrop of the Amazon basin and colonial Ecuador is truly fascinating."
4,"overall, a compelling read","I feel that I must state that the title of the book is somewhat misleading. Over half of the book is not at all about Isabel, ""The mapmaker's wife,"" but rather about the expedition that led her husband to Peru and what historical and scientific events led to that expedition. At times, this got a little tedious, because all along I was waiting for Isabel's story. Still, the recounting of what these men accomplished for the scientific community is simply astonishing, and when Isabel's story is finally reached, it is as compelling and incredible as promised. She was a remarkable woman, accomplishing what many people could not do, even today. Overall, the book is an interesting and informative read about a little-known (at least to me), and yet important, expedition. Good for those who like history; may be a tough read for those who do not."
5,Fresh Perspective on History,"When my friend passed this book on to me, I was expecting a historical novel with dialogue and romance. However, I was pleasantly surprised by a nonfiction story woven from documents, letters, and research. I have always loved maps and been intrigued with how early naturalists figured out details about nature, so this book was a page-turner for me. I couldn't put it down. It was amazing what this team endured to collect data for information that we learn in elementary school today. It also gives insight and context to some of modern day political and social issues."
3,A mistitled book,"If you're looking for a dry, text book-like story of exploration and science, this is the book for you. If you, like me, think it's going to be a gripping story of adventure, romance, and survival you will be sorely disappointed. I gave it 3 stars only because the author obviously did his homework and offers remarkable detail on scientific topics of the time. However, the book was so excruciatingly boring that I began reading the first paragraph of every chapter until I wearily made it to the tiring end out of sheer curiosity. Never have I read a book that took such a rich story and drained it of all life. Kudos to the publisher, you duped us all."
2,stereotypes!,It's a shame the author didn't read a bit more about Spain and Spanish America. He resurrects the Black Legend about the Spanish and makes Peruvians sound like mindless robots who follow the Crown/Church orders. Anyone with historical background will want to throw this at the wall at times. Too bad.
4,A pretty good book if you'll give it a chance,"I'll be honest - although I did enjoy the book, it did not flow for me like some historical books have. It took me a bit longer to read than most books and there were days where I put the book down and several days passed without the desire to go back and read. But once I got about halfway through the book, it started to flow quite a bit better as time went on. Having the maps and pictures helped to understand the scope of what Isabel and others had to go through.There are a lot of characters and it is hard to follow all of them at times - none of them were really fleshed out to me. I found myself constantly going back to prior chapters to remind myself who was who...But, if you'll give the book a chance, keeping in mind the historical and scientific aspect and not just looking for a gripping adventure or a heartwrenching love story - like me, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
1,Mistitled and misrepresented,"Let me tell you first - I did not finish the book. I got more than halfway and just gave it up. I was expecting more descriptions of the Amazon territory and peoples and, yes, more about the 'wife's' trip on the river. I came away from my attempt with lots of info I didn't need on the shape of the earth, latitude and longitude determinations, and scarcely a mention of the wife and her journey. It was mostly socio-political commentary for that period in history and, I'm sure, highly gratifying to some. I enjoy cartography, nature, etc. and was totally disappointed."
3,Fun,Interesting read for us old cable guys that lived through this. I was low on the totem pole at the time (still am) so seeing it from this angle made it a fun couple of days of reading.
3,"Lots of data, little hard to follow",The book was absolutely packed with data points but overall it was hard to follow. Would be nice to have a follow up book since this one ends in 1999.
4,worked with modification,"this part must fit a number of cars and trucks, for my application the part was 180 degrees out ,with a modification to the steering shaft i was able to use the part.my truck is 30 years old so having to adapt is not uncomon."
2,Could have been a great book,"As many reviewers before have mentioned, this could have been a much better book if only it had been sent to an editor that had served in the Navy and specifically on aircraft carries.The author describes seaplanes from a cruiser with 2 engines and describes the Japanese Betty bomber as a fighter. But he even confuses the Midway class carriers with the Essex class when trying to compare the size of the new Forrestal class carriers. (I served on the USS Midway and he is wrong on the facts)It could have been so much better with a little more editing."
1,Great Father's Day Gift,I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day and he is almost finished as he is always reading a few chapters at different times of the day. He really enjoys this author. He never seemed to have time to read until he retired but really enjoys it now. It is so easy to buy books from Amazon.
5,Right On,"Like so many others, I was there and the author brings back memories that have been long tucked away. He makes that day come alive for the reader and adds details that most who were there could not have known.Thank you for honoring those men who gave their life and who history has ignored."
1,This game is stupid!,"For one thing this game is not even a real Final Fantasy (The way you can tell if an FF is real or not is if it has a number after the name, i.e. FFX, FFVII, FFVI, etc..) another thing is that it is way to childish! Yeah I know the GCN was made for ""kids"" and all but Square-Enix could've gave them something better, I guess they just wanted to keep all the good FFs on PS2, lol. Also the characters look really stupid! What is with that thing with the long neck? I know they were ""trying"" to do something original and all but that thing just looked stupid! The only reason I am giving this game 1 star is because the multiplayer part of the game, that is something I have been wanting to do for years in FFs (besides wanting to battle party vs. party in Chrono Cross)."
1,What are you? A Nintendo sales rep?,"Sorry, I'll stick with my Playstation FF titles. What you may NOT know is that the developer of Crystal Chronicles is the mind behind the, err, ""interesting"" Playstation title ""Unlimited Saga"" as well as FF2 (which many of the playstation owners abhor). Power is great but sometimes you just can't judge a book by its cover. Indeed, the preview spots have been impressive (I saw mine during LOTR: Return of the King!), but I'll simply fall back on two words: ""Unlimited Saga"".Caveat Emptor!"
2,Please make it stop,"How long have video games been in existence now?!Heres a RPG with no chalenge,very few enemy types,mind numbing music,towns with buldings you cant even go into,shops that sell worthless items,equipment your character cant equip,etc.Horrible stuff.Good graphics though!Thats what sells it,how cares about the other stuff,right game designers?Gameplay is basically slash away at enemies/bosses or you can use your endless magic or cure.Its almost like playing a regular game with a code that makes it too easy!Worst RPG I have ever played."
3,"Good, but room for improvement","I have loved this series for a long time but I was a little disapointed with this one. First I'll tell you about some good points. The grafics are outstanding. Maybe the best grafics I have ever seen. Also the multiplayer mode is great. The only problem with that is that you need 3 other friends with Game Boy Advnces. Even alone, it can be fun though. Plus the music is great. A bad point is that the story is a little flat. At least for me I need a good storyline in a game. If the story was a little better there would be nothing keeping me from giving this game a 5 star rating. However the game may get repetitive doing the same thing over and over again. Even so it will keep you busy for a long time.Overall this game is good if you don't care much for a story and just enjoy playing the game."
4,Kickin',"This is the best game ever! I couldn't wait to get this game, and when I got it, I couldn't beleive my eyes. It has the best graphics and sound quality imaginable. A must have."
1,Even worse than a good deal of freeware games,"The other day I was bored of playing on the computer and since I am a Final Fantasy fan, I decided to get FF CC for my GBA to do somethign diferent for a while. Guess what. It didn't take long before I actualyl got bored of this game. Graphics are not that great, musics/sounds only so so, and the storyline, the empties of any Final Fantasy game I have seen so far. Multiplayer is nothing so special that you cannot actually do with any games for computers. Geez, even freeware games such as Astroseries and Freija are better than FF CC. My opinion? Look for another Final Fantasy. Most (if not all) are better than FF CC."
3,"OK, but far from great.","Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is a game I want to hate. I really do. But I just can't. Despite its many flaws, it is still fun.Everyone keeps saying how great the graphics are. Maybe if I had a progressive scan, HDTV, I'd agree. But on my system, they are only above average. A little blurry, a little simplistic, but with just enough quality and charm to keep them from being bad.The multiplayer is fun with three or four people, but not so much with two, and a chore if you are alone.The style of gameplay is also fine, but not stellar. There's little reason to fight enemies (unless you bonus gauge is tied to it), all your RPG type improvements come from items you buy, or bosses you defeat. And on the subject of items, why can't you sell your old equipment?As for the complaints about the GBAs required for multiplayer, they are sour grapes. The GBA is great, allowing each player to tailor his own skills without disrupting the game for everyone else. Kinda like real life."
5,"A must Buy, It's everywhere","Why do you thing everybody is buying it?The game can't be that bad if it has sold over 400,000 copies only in americaCommon you know you want it"
3,"A rough start, a smooth finish","Many people, it seems are very disappointed with the beginning of this game, as was I. The plot is weak, the fighting is tedious, and multiplayer, for many, is unachievable because of its GBA requirements. About half way through the game however, things start to pick up. The plot thickens, the terrain and bosses are stunning, and fighting starts getting interesting.If you want to enjoy this game you have to buy it. The part of the game you'll experience during a rental, well ... sucks. Buy it or don't play it at all.3 stars. Good hack and slash, great graphics. Needs more spells, cheaper multiplayer capabilities, and a better start to the plot."
4,"Great book-super pictures, good advice, nice recipes","Once again, Martha has inspired us with her advice and illustrations. This book follows Martha month to month in her (and her staff's) preparations of flower and vegetable gardens, the trees and shrubs at Turkey Hill.It helps one to understand the layout of her gardens there. Some recipes using items from her garden are included. It does not give as much advice as one might expect, but inspires all the same. Martha does have much for all of us to learn, men and women!Yes, there are some things we wouldn't use in day to day living, but, almost everything she covers in her books and on her shows(from climbing trees to beekeeping to cooking and gardening) are very pragmatic."
4,Great Pictures and very motivating,"I was motivated to plant everything and anything, especially sweet peas and a vegetable garden; however, she tends to go overboard on planting everything and anything, and it may become overwhelming and/or confusing to the weekend gardener. I reccommend the book for the pictures and the creative ideas for everyone."
3,Ok product,Its ok. It's worth it for the price. The only problem I had is the leveler is not accurate. I put it up against a 48inch leveler and had the laser pointed on to the line. And yea. It wasn't accurate. But I drew one line that I knew was accurate and I made the laser aligned with that line and of course it will be leveled continually after that. So overall it's ok.
4,adjustable bike mirror,"Probably the best of a limited selection of bike mirrors available. It vibrates less than the plastic ones, has a good-sized mirror, very adjustable. Could do more with the challenges of attachment to helmets, but works well."
3,"Quality product, not for me","I wear a broad-brimmed hat when I ride, so with this mirror all I see is hat. The best I could do after lots of fiddling was to be able to see behind me if I cocked my head up and to the left just so, and then I couldn't see where I was going. So it's back to dual Mirrycle mirrors for me. Having said all that, the TakeALook appears to be a very well designed and constructed device for those without hats."
1,Mirror? Really,"This item is about 1 inch square. MAybe it's me but I can't see anything, I was expecting a mirror but this looks more like reflective metal without a good image."
2,Bike Peddler Cycling Eyeglass Mirror - Just Okay,"This mirror is okay. Fits over you sun or eyglasses ok, but is a bit small and doesn't extend out enough to safely check behind you while watching ahead of you at the same time. It is also a bit fragile while attempting to adjust and could be dangerous if you need to adjust while in motion due to wind knocking it ot of adjustment while riding."
3,A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I have always used a mirror that is attached to the end of my handlebar. The screws on that mirror periodically loosen and so I decided to try the mirror that attaches to my glasses. I found it too difficult to actually see traffic behind me. There are huge blind spots when you're riding on any kind of bumpy surface. I liked the mirror better when it was attached to my helmet, but overall, I see more clearly and dependably with my original handlebar mirror. I'll just have to tighten those screws before every ride!"
2,Has to be adjusted every time you put on helmet,"Mirror requires fine adjustment. Every time you put on your helmet, you are going to have to adjust the mirror. And the difference of 1 mm means that you won't see what you want to see. Falls off easily."
1,can't figure it out,"I bought one of these, but it came with no directions, no photo of it installed and my husband and I are mystified about how to use the darn thing. HELP!!!!!!!!"
5,Ideal !,"As a 50+ cyclist ,checking traffic behind me is near impossible .I purchased this mirror based on reviews .It is full value for all theKudos it receives .I clipped mine to my helmet visor .It is very secure ,but I added a zip tie (for my clumsy days) It takes a few minutes to adjust,and learn to view while riding,Then the range of visibility is amazing.A quick glance every 30 seconds makesme feel much safer"
3,"Good mirror, not so good stability","While I love the mirror and it's flexibility, getting it on my helmet and keeping it steady is a nightmare. It took a while to get it to stay steady on the helmet and then each time I ride I have to reset it. Further, it moves far too easily when I am riding (which is strictly on the road)."
4,It works,"I did a lot of on line research on helmet mounted, glass mounted and handle bar mounted rear view mirrors. Net, no silver bullet, all of them have some drawbacks. This one works. Although you have to cock your head a bit and depending on the glasses that I am wearing have to close one eye.....well just for a minute. I bought the std size......and the view meets minimum. p.s. I would not trust this mirror without looking back to turn into traffic."
3,buy a longer stem,"It fits my helment very well, the mirror if of good quality, but the stem is too short. The mirror is too close to your eye so you have to change your gaze quite a bit. It's disorienting to do so and takes your eyes far away from the road ahead."
5,Better than a bar mount,I ride rough Indiana county roads err day. My old bar mount mirror shook so much it was almost useless. I was so happy when a stranger on the bus knocked it off while loading her bike next to mine. I bought this glasses mount and after a week I love everything it. I use it on low profile Oakley FLAK sunglasses so it doesn't stick out as far to the side as it might if you wore it on glasses.
5,"Quality, functional, outstanding","This product is well-made, easier to use, and a ""have to"" for a bicycler. This is my third one purchased. Why am I purchasing more than one? I keep losing them. The device is small and easy to lose track of if one is not super careful. My last one has a larger mirror and a shorter shank which extends out from the front of ones eye glasses. I think I prefer this one to the old longer shank, but this a just a personal preference. Your level of safety will increase dramatically with one of the Bike PeddlerTake A Look Cycyling Eyeglass Mirror"
2,For large frame only,Very nice concept and well made. The major negative is that it does not work on thinner wire frame glasses. The spring action is too tight and bends the frame. It is also too long and droops. It only works if it is taped to the glasses - a major inconvenience. Now sits in my box of unused bike items.
5,Great Product!,"This cycling mirror is one of the best that I have owned. My previous mirror was made of plastic and originally tightened by pressing the ball into the socket. This worked for about six months. After that, every bump moved the mirror down and rendered it useless. The Bike Peddler mirror is metal and is built in a way that won't loosen over time. It was easy to bend the non-brass part of the Peddler to fit my helmet. In addition, the unit arrived in great condition because the packaging was fantastic (bubble wrap in a box). I ordered the classic version as I wanted the larger mirror."
4,Bike Peddler - Take A Look Cycling Mirror,It's like looking at a large mirror in front of you.You see much more than a mirror on your bike handle.I like it very much.
4,"works, but takes getting used to","The mirror works okay--if you look on youtube, there's a video by a lady that has some good suggestions on how to adjust it. Like her - I used zip ties to secure it to my visor. The problem with the mirror is that it is so small that even after you adjust it just right, your head has to be in the exact same position to see-it takes some getting used to. The mirror seems a little flimsy when you first take it out, but once in place it seems like it will hold up as long as I don't drop my helmet very hard on to it.Update...got a handlebar mirror so I could see my kid on the trailer bike behind me while using the visor mirror for the road. Handlebar mirror was useless--it's so low and vibrates with the road so much you can't make anything out. Upgrading to 5 star as there doesn't seem to be a better alternative."
4,Handy little mirror,"This is our second set of eyeglass mirrors. They are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don't want to go anywhere without them. I even find myself checking my ""mirror"" when I'm walking and don't have it on. One drawback that we've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent. But that hasn't really been an issue for us.Give these easy to use mirrors a try. I won't ride without one."
2,Augghhhhhhhhh,"Oh, Man! I really screwed up on this. First of all I ended up ordering 2 (when I thought I had only ordered one!)THEN, I find the mirror goes ON YOUR HELMET OR GLASSES!! I just could not get it to work.Total waste of $$, for me. I guess I need to read the description more carefully, next time. I thought it went on the bile HANDLE!"
1,Not a good mirror when used with glasses,"Not sure about all the glowing reviews here. For me, this mirror is no good at all. I do not have a bill on my helmet so I do not know about that config, but clamping to my eyewear does not work. I have tried every possible angle and combination, but mostly I am looking at my shoulder and only with strain can i occassionally see something in the road behind me. Quite useless"
1,Maybe it's just me...,"... but this thing seems to add a hazard to my ride. I can't really see much using it. I've been used to looking over my shoulder as I ride, and while this is not the safest thing to do, I get the whole picture when I do it. I did not feel comfortable using this -- AND I ended up looking over my shoulder, anyway. Like I said, maybe it's just me. If you like mirrors on your helmet or on your eyewear, well, disregard this review... Either way, be safe out there, brother and sister riders!!"
3,Just a bit too short...,"This 'does what it says on the tin', but for me it is just a tiny bit too short.I have gone for the original one recently to do a comparison.I'd recommend it if you ride in heavy motor transport traffic."
5,beats every other eyeglass mirro I have used,"Ive used them all. this one is the all time best. Why didn't I get this model yers ago? I don't know, it's a stupid bike owner thing. Glass face gives crystal clear view. totally adjustable to fit your riding position. strong construction. it is best in class!"
4,attachable rear view mirror for cycling,The mirror is well made and it's amazing how clear it actually is. It takes a bit to get used to focusing on the mirror and tilting the head to be able to see behind you.
5,Needed it,"Have had this item awhile , use it all the time . Very happy with it and seller . Very satisfied . 5 stars ."
4,works well,The instructions were a little obscure but a phone call cleared that up. A little fiddling during the first ride. Sturdy hold on my glasses. No jiggling.
4,Gives a good view,I had a round mirror before and it was also smaller. This gives a good wide view but it does take a little getting use to the larger blind spot it creates. I also bought the helmet adaptor but would not have had to because it works fairly well attached to the visor of the helmet. I think I get a better view with this than a handlebar mirror. The only negative about this mirror is that the plastic model had ball joints so you could move the arm laterally. This you can only move the mirror laterall. It is not a big issue but it does make adjustment of the mirror a little tricker and may limit it's use on some visors.
3,A bit overpromising,"I ordered this mirror, after reading the great reviews here, as a replacement to the cracked Blackburn bar end mirror on my bike. I've used it in my commute in Madrid with my folder over the last month and I'm a bit disappointed. No problem adjusting it: I watched a video on Youtube on attaching it to my sunglasses and gave it a go. But its field of view is just too narrow for multi-lane streets. And despite the dedicated sunglasses it requires adjustment every time.The bar end mirror-despite the wad of Scotch tape- is much more reliable. I do get asked about it at traffic lights. So it gets an extra star on coolness."
5,Wouldn't ride without it.,"Lost my mirror during a ride (at a stop). I had forgotten what is was to ride without it. Would not ride without a mirror, so I ordered two this time to have a backup. This mirror is easy to attach to several types of glasses and easy to adjust."
3,too small to see,I ordered the smaller mirror as I wasn't clear which one to order---advise ordering larger one---the arm needs to be farther out from your glasses to see better what is behind you
3,Is there REALLY a helmet adapter?,"The item I received from BikeWorldUSA is the original cyclist mirror. No helmet adapter (which the ad says is included). You can clip it to your glasses or perhaps to a visor using the three-segment arm shown in the picture, but if there IS such a thing as a helmet adapter it's not shown and it's not shipped. It seems like using the glasses clip on a visor would work. My helmet has no visor so I can't say for sure."
5,Original is great,"I have been using the original mirror. it takes a little while to find the perfect position, but it stays in position pretty well once you find the sweet spot. It is meant for flat armed glasses, but you can bend the grips to fit oddly shaped glasses, like mine. The whole unit is pretty adjustable, and the metal can be bent by hand if necessary"
5,A must have,I purchased this to use while I Inline skate on the area bike trails. I don't know how I survived so long without it. I've had it for months and hasn't given me a single problem.
4,eyeglass mirror,"I love this mirror, I am a first time user and a new cyclist, the mirror is very versatile and lightweight."
5,the best cycling mirror,"The absolute best cycling mirror. I have used various cycling mirrors over the years. This is my favorite. It is extremely adjustable, yet stays firmly in place once adjusted. It is amazing how much you can see in a tiny mirror. Using a mirror to see traffic behind you makes cycling a little safer."
3,"Eh, not great, not bad","I purchased this mirror based on other reviews. I wouldn't say it's much better than any others out there. I do like the way you adjust the mirror. This feature is very nice. The mount is kinda funky but easy to make work with the little adapter kit for helmets. Vibration city though. I ride a recumbent road bike (Linear Limo 3.0) and noticed that every mirror I tried vibrates. It might be the 100PSI tires, it might be the weight on the end of a pendulum. If this ever breaks, I'd buy another one simply because I'm used to it."
4,Biking Mirror,Good product. Works very well and provides a clear view of what is behind you allowing you to react to riders and vehicles coming up from behind.
5,extra bike safety,"I bought this mirror to replace one that i have been using for seven years, which got lost. It is a pity that the manufacturer does not export, especially in these difficult times. One feels so much safer with being being able to keep an eye on what is behind, this is especially so on making a turn across traffic. Try driving a car with no mirrors? The glass reflector is so much better than the plastic one which other manufacturers' use, which also snap off quite easily. The back of the mirror surface needs some tape on it to stop scrarching. The metal arm is tough (others use brittle plastic) and stays in place once the required position has been determined. It has been used in England (left hand driving) and France, (right side). I have a collection of bikes, but only need just one BPTALCEM."
4,A really good mirror,"I replaced a series (they break!) of those plastic Third Eye eyeglass mount mirrors with one of these. Better in every way and they even mount on modern sunglasses with curved temple pieces without causing damage to either the mirror or the sunglasses. They look a little dorky, but everything comes with a downside..."
4,It works; just be prepared to fine-tune for optimum performance,"This product works. When set properly, I can glance at the mirror and have a pretty good rear view down the road. The trick is to set it properly. It requires a lot of adjustments initially, for you to figure out how this simple contraption works. It took me almost 3 weeks to appreciate it's functionality.Once you learn how to use it properly, a few seconds is all it takes to adjust. I find it best to fine-tune the adjustments while riding (with one hand).When I am positioned in the drops, I lose the 'sweet spot' rear view. I think it works best when riding in one position. So I always adjust it in my dominant riding position(which is on the hoods).Also, I usually get a lot of stares, smiles and occasional comments about the mirror as this type is not common where I live."
5,"solid, don't ride the roads without it, increase your situational awareness","I now own several of these, one for day, night and a spare. Simple, bends back into shape.For comparison in my experience-Every plastic one I've used has broken or deflected too easily.A bit difficult to hold on thick frames and on extremely thin frames."
4,About as good as it gets,"I haven't used a mirror in about 3 years because the one I had wouldn't fit on my new glasses. But, I was going to do a 100 miles on a pretty busy two line highway so decided I needed one. The instructions are not very user friendly, but once I figured it out it worked great. I've tried a lot of mirrors over the years and this one is second only to one that came with my ancient Skid Lid helmet. It works. I would give it 5 stars if the instructions were better."
3,Compact is Different from original !,"The compact version is a smaller size mirror which is GOOD in theory, because it weighs less and drags less. BUT, the extension wire from the glasses is SHORTER which is BAD if you are older and may not be able to focus as close as you used to. The Original size is FAR better for us older bikers. If you have tried ANY helmet or glasses mount mirror and ""couldn't get used to it"" then try mounting it farther away from the eye. Even a quarter inch may make a huge difference. I wouldn't ride without this mirror (original size!). Peter"
4,"fits ""almost"" all helmets","The mirror and its attachment is better than the ones I have purchased, however, the attachment does not addapt to all helmets. I have two helmets by Specialized: one I had no problem attaching to, the other, the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly. It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets. This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment. Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me. This review is intended for your design department. Thanks for the mirror."
5,"Best bicycle mirror made, for most glasses wearers","A few reviewers state these glasses can't be worn with wire-rimmed glasses. Although this is undoubtedly true for some glasses, I have been wearing this mirror for over 5 years on 3 different pairs of wire-rimmed glasses with no problem, so if you wear wire-rimmed glasses, don't be discouraged without trying them first. The trick is, I put the first brace in front of the hinge rather than putting all 3 braces on the temple as one would with wider temples. I also mount the braces horizontally rather than vertically as one would with wide temples. On my glasses (Polo and Safilo brands) this gives a snug, secure fit. We have busy streets around where I live, and I would never head out the door without this mirror."
4,worth the money,"Works well once you get use to it, tried it on helmet and eyeglasses, I found the eyeglass mounting felt more comfortable."
5,Buy It!,"This is the mirror to get. Good quality mirror, wide view, stable image. I prefer clipping it to my baseball cap as opposed to my glasses. It did take me awhile to figure out how to orient it but once I did there was no need to ever adjust it again; it maintains it's settings perfectly."
2,to small,"This mirror fits the glasses frame nicely and is fairly easy to install. It is, however. much to small. It is very difficult to see behind you because the mirror is so small. I never was able to get it adjusted so I could just glance at it without having to move my head to see the rear view. Over all it is a real pain to use so I replaced it with a bolt on rear view bicycle mirror."
1,Too small to be of use!,"I was expecting this edition to be the same size as the second edition. However, it is so small as to be essentially useless! Recommend Amazon.com discontinue this item to avoid having a great number of disappointed or even hostile customers."
2,3rd edition print WAY TOO SMALL,"I saw comments that the print in the third edition was too small, but I bought it anyway. Big mistake. The print is so small that the dictionary is virtually useless. It's about 5-6 point type. I need a magnifying glass to read it, and complex Chinese characters come out as little more than a black blob, even with a magnifying glass, because the characters can't be printed that small. Don't buy this dictionary!!!!The only reason I gave it a ""2"" rather than a ""1"" is that the content seems okay (as much as I can see of it, anyway)."
1,"Not as expected, Much too small for everyday use","I only gave the third edition of the book a 1 star partially to gather attention of new buyers. Please note the content is very similar to the second edition but has one major flaw. The physical and print size is about half that of the second edition making it hard to read and use as a functional at home dictionary. I recomend anyone needing a dictionary with traditional (very hard to find a good one) to buy the larger ""Oxford Chinese Dictionary"" ISBN: 0195964594."
4,"Action, Suspense and a Little Romance","Gabe loses his memory when a bomb explodes outside Dr Richard's house. The government is unable to prove he is guilty of killing Dr Richards. Cassie decides to break into Gabe's house to try to find the missing toxin. She leads the murderer to Gabe and they end up on the run together.Romance, suspense... interesting story. I enjoyed this book."
1,If You Don't Mind Re-Makes ....,"With all due respect to the other reviewer, this entire series, put out by Madacy, is a monumental sham and, if you're expecting original versions, I urge you to read the reviews sent in on some of the other CDs in the series before making your purchase.n this one, for example, you only have to listen to the sample of Harbor Lights to realize that that is NOT Tony Williams leading the way. Or, if it is, he had laryngitis when he re-recorded it."
5,Oldies but GOODIES,This is a great collection of oldies. If you like oldies then I recommend this CD or Tape.
5,Soul-Wrenching!,"The Eye of Horus is the first book dealing with Egypt that I have read, and I am afraid to read another, least I be disappointed.Carol Thurston brings to life two stories at the same time, running parallel to one another, until they meet at the end. Not only was I drawn into this book emotionally, I was also intrigued by it mentally.Once I became familiar with the names of the long dead Egyptians, the book flowed freely until I finished it.I encourage everyone who enjoys reading to pick up this book, snuggle up with a few candles burning...and enjoy!!!"
5,these games are great!!!,These games are really addicting. And you get 2 for the price of 1 in this pack so I would recommend this pack instead of getting each separately. For some reason the Product Description is inaccurate. The games are as pictured: Danger on Deception Island and Haunted Carousel.
1,Stay Tuned For Danger,I wouldn't know if it's fun since it doesn't work and I got screwed on the purchase.
3,Beautiful but stopped working,"I admit I have rather bad luck with fountains, but I love them so I keep buying them. This one is every bit as gorgeous as it looks, maybe even more so, and I love the mist. However, for whatever reason, it stopped working after about a week. I followed all the instructions (which happened to be hilarious in the way they were translated into English) and I didn't run it for more than a couple of hours at a time. I have no idea what happened, but I think I'm going to have to stop buying fountains."
5,College Simplified,"living in a dorm gives me limited options for rearranging my room, but a long tv cable helps. this cable was perfect for my needs."
1,Bad end connectors,Disappointed in this cable as one of the ends quickly came loose (even though it is moulded) and I ended up buying a end replacement kit to fix it.
2,okay but not worth the money or shipping costs,"I used to clean a heavy cast iron propane grill grate after cooking, don't use before cooking unless you wipe down the grate. Did the job, but as previous reviewer mentioned after few uses leaves flakes of the steel material on the grate, but takes off caked on grease and charred flesh from previous grilling.It's okay, but I will not be buying replacement scrubbers, the wire brushes do the same trick and don't leave any steel flakes in your grill."
2,scrubbers,i wish the seller would've said getting 3/price of one.. shipping way to much. i assumed it was under amazon free shipping.. but they were nice about it..
5,Passion Seeki ng Romance,"This book is sensational. I'm an aviator and don't usually read this kind of book. However, once I picked this book up and read just a few poems I noticed in a special way that it would help me to express just exactlly how I feel toward a special women in my life. The author is allowing me to understand and express my love in a more meaningful way to the women I care most about.After reading the entire book I highly recommend that every man should buy this book to better express their feelings to their loved ones."
3,Liked it then didn't.,I bought this on sale and when I got it I thought it was really nice. It looks great and was easy to take links out so it would fit. I only wear it a couple days a week. After about a month one side of the clasp was not locking as well. Then i forgot to take it off when a was doing my dishes. Shouldn't have been a problem since it's suppossed to be water resistant right? Well not so much. It still works but has condensation that doesn't go away.
5,Gorgeous Watch,"I received this watch as a gift and fell in love with it immediately! I'm a bit of a watch fanatic so I have a pretty nice sized collection, but this quickly became my favorite. It's so perfect--the size, the weight, the sparkle! It goes with everything I wear and looks great! I'm in love!"
2,Buyer Beware...,"My husband bought me this watch for Christmas. I fell in love with it immediately. That soon changed, right along with the two-tone color of it! After about 3 months, the silver tone got blackish tarnish on it that will not come off, and the gold tone turned into a purple-ish, copper-ish color!!! If this was an inexpensive, $25 watch, I would expect this to happen, but not for $180! Spend your money on something else."
2,minimally adequate,"The fit and finish on these cutters was disappointing. The jaws neither open very wide, about an inch, nor do they close COMPLETELY. Having said that; they do cut rigid steel fine but do not handle more flexible items like heavy barbed wire and fencing well since they tend to canter and pinch the wire between the sides of the jaws. I would have been better off going to Sears or Home Depot and eyeballing a pair."
1,Used them to cut Rebar and the Jaw Broke,"I used them to cut a few small pieces of soft steel 1/4""maybe 3 or 4 times and then 1 piece of rebar and that wasall she wrote. The jaw snapped and no one has replacment jaws.Needless to say I will need to purchase a real set of Bolt cutters now."
4,Good quality replacement for OEM cable.,Replacement cable for a Dell MP3100 projector. Seems as sturdy as the original cable although only time will tell how tough it is.
1,is this book for real,i cant believe that people actually believe this. this is right wing christian crap. trying to brainwash young people into believing the science is false. and in return they get the hope they an invisible bearded man in the sky will take them to an invisible wonderland.
3,"King of elephants, knave of theory","My two year old son loves the pictures in this book, especially the giant blue whale and the tan camels. But don't take it too seriously as an introduction to mixing color. Babar may be king of the elephants but as a color theorist, he's a lightweight. Babar tells us that mixing the three primary colors makes black. Then, a few pages later, he tells us that to make brown you have to mix the three primary colors PLUS black. What? But I thought... Also strange--the ""what will you paint with white?"" illustration done in ice blue and every color BUT white. The problem isn't the contradictions but the fact that De Brunhoff sets himself up with the difficult task of bridging color theory, practice, and artistic convention in less than 30 pages. In a children's book! But kids will probably like the bright, clean illustrations. Also odd (in a non-color mixing way)--the page where Flora, Babar's elephant daughter, paints a herd of ten naked elephants."
4,3-D glasses,"The glasses came immediately and in perfect shape. I actually did not order the correct glasses, but that was not the fault of this company. I just didn't know that the new 3D movies use a different 3D technology so the old red and blue 3D glasses don't work. Not sure what kind I should have gotten.These are great for the old stuff though."
3,Ok not great,They are pretty cool and all but for 3d glasses not really. I put them on one day and noticed that I could see the red and blue in the image really clear hurts my eyes don't really give a good 3d effect.
2,Not as Expected,"1st of all it's very small, the size is not for average adultpaper glasses are much more better3/10"
5,Hard to find!,We have searched high and low for these gloves for my husband. They are not the bulky type that you can't feel what you are doing but that protect you from the elements. We will purchase them again.
3,"Gossipy, persuasive but inaccurate and shallow","I am not an admirer of Ian Buruma's writing as a result of this book. He got to interview many prominent figures in Chinese diaspora politics but he never bothered to verify what he was told nor could he resist applying and referring to Japanese interpretations (his strongest suit) to his ""analysis"" of Chinese politics."
5,For Sony Cybershot,"Lexar products are as good as the Sony counterpart at half the price. I own several Lexar Memory sticks for my other Sony products and have never, ever had a problem."
2,Dirty and Scratched,Product arrived with numerous finger smudges and several small scratches. Not thrilled with the care or lack there of with the seller before shipping.
4,Eye opening,"This book is a travelogue of journeys the author took into Burma to retrace George Scott's adventures of the 1880s. The author, Andrew Marshall, seems to be a journalist based in Thailand, from where he has been able to travel to Burma relatively easily. While in Burma, he tries hard to make contact with tribal people, especially the Shans, who Scott spent so much time with 100 years before. The narrative is split between Scott's travels in the nineteenth century, and Marshall's present day experiences.Occasionally, Marshall's informal style of writing, with his use of British slang, gets a bit thick for me. Nevertheless, the case that he makes against the Burmese military is quite compelling. I've heard friends and acquaintances argue on both sides of the question of whether traveling to or working in modern day Burma provides support for the brutal government there. After reading this book, however, I don't see myself going anywhere near the country until there is a regime change."
2,Disappointing,"Finished the book. Did I like it? Not really. Men might enjoy the bits of fourth grade humor (farts, etc.). A gripe: surely after slogging through almost 300 pages and finally reaching the mythical Wa lake with the author and his friend, David, the reader deserves at least one photo of it. If you do choose to read this adventure don't skip the short Epilogue. Of course so much has changed (hopefully for the better) since it was written. It's definitely not a book to prepare you for a present day first or second visit to Burma."
1,nope.,"After reading other reviews for this stuff I decided to give it a try cloning Stevia Cuttings. No dice. No results at all. I tried both rockwool, water and soil for cloning with absolutely no results. Followed the directions to the letter and tried about 20 different cuttings to make sure it wasn't user error. Every single one of them died.I got better results just sticking the stevia cuttings in straight water and changing it out once a week. At least I got those cuttings to survive and start to root after a month or so.I always hate to write a negative review, but I just couldn't get this stuff to work."
1,Just a fertilizer!,"This is just a viscously compounded fertilizer which contains no hormonal stimulants at all to help promote rooting in plants. It's a thick mixture of water, viscous agents and fertilizers which you can make on your own! Very disappointed with the advertisements which act as though it contains IBA compounds or related ingredients to promote root formation. Don't buy it."
1,still collating data,still collating data unsure if I wasusing it according to guidelines. it a pearsjust to be a vitamin compound of naturalingredients.
1,"Basic, and poorly printed","Bought this book for my son's first car, hoping to teach him a little about basic repair and maintenance. The book is so poorly printed that most of the images are hard if not impossible to use. Many of the sections are not specific enough to the car that he has to help shed light on the repair being performed.I haven't tried other manuals on this specific car, but I remember 20 years ago when I was a mechanic that Chilton's was THE manual to have. That's really changed."
1,Lacks Detail for Interier work,"Good electrical diagrams and mechanical guide, but lacks detail in the interior work. Like, taking out the dash. Directions are limited and terms used are not clear on what is being described."
4,"Pretty old, altough a must-have","I bought 3 books from amazon in order for research for my upcoming animation production.For a classic, traditional 2D animation its pretty good, and has also HELPFUL tips for Animators-block, wich I hasent found anywere else. Altough its NOT covering DIGITAL PAINT, and talks only about Cel's, the old way to shot and colorize frames. Today NO ONE is using this techince, NO ONE (exept for Ed, Edd n' Eddy series).So if you don't wish to work on the Ed Edd n' Eddy production, you better buy this book with the new digial edition of ""The Animation Book"". Not forgetting the MUST HAVE ""The Animator survival kit"". At least that was I had done. (And had cost me 75$ for express shipping to Israel...).And the graphics (Illustration, colors...) of the book is low, as well is the paper quality, but the reason I ranked it 4 and not 5 is beacuse its covers Cel's and not Digital Paint.Don't forget to click on the ""This comment is helpful"" Button."
5,One of Sartre's best,"Sartre writes about his very early life. He writes about things that as an adult you aren't even conscious of anymore. How reading a book about horses and armies can bring those things to life. Sartre talks about his grandfather, his mother, his absent father. He is pretty dispassionate about them. The main thing about the book is Sartres' keen observation and reckless honesty. In the usual autobiography you get alot of bluster, the secret to my success type stuff. Someone, I think it was Martin Amis, said, all autobiographies are success stories. You see that all the time. How I rose from my humble background to be a rich and famous such and such. Well you don't get that here. This is Jean Paul's life before he ever did anything noteworthy. Astonishing level of honesty. I look at memoirs differently after this."
1,An Error of Isolation,"He wanted us to read about his life, to discover how he turned himself into a genius, to find the turn that made him conclude earnestly, ""God does not exist."" It's as if atheism became his raison d'etre, a true a priori thinker though he professed exactly the opposite. As Marvin Farber wrote, ""Some reading in the literature of evolution, and especially of cultural anthropology, might have (had) a salutary effect on his thinking and writing."" In short, Sartre confused his literary devices with actual reality. That he thought his words would provide him immortality attests to his intellectual arrogance. ""I am the giver and the gift,"" he wrote. Actually, his right hand didn't know what his left hand was really doing. His ignorance of what was really happening behind the Iron Curtain is his true legacy."
2,very small cross,This was delivered very quickly but was much smaller and delicate than I expected. The clasp is very difficult to get on and off because it's very tiny. Maybe better for a child than an adult if you change the chain.
2,Didn't work for us.,"We purchased this because our puppy learned to jump our fence. The first one didn't work, but Amazon quickly sent us another one. This did not work for us at all because the dog didn't mind being sprayed and we could never get the settings right - either gave her too much room much int he yard (didn't spray til after she was over the fence) or not enough."
2,Computer Crasher,"If you can get this software to work, the course material is good. Unfortunately, it tends to lock your PC regularly during use - this is, if you have the patience to get the stuff installed in the first place. I had to try installation 3 times before I made it all the way through without locking up my PC."
1,Do NOT Buy!!,"1)Installation stalls on my win98 machine.2) Drop down menu's are terrible. The area you put your mouse over is so small, it drive you crazy.These guys need/should have done a beta test on all machines.Website support(link is broken)."
4,bling bling,"I like this bag. Its a real loud one though. If you like ""Bling Bling"" go for this.Has some weight to it due to chains. Nice roomy size and comparments for cell makeup etc. I wish the strap was longer. Can use as shoulder strap as long as there is no jacket."
1,not comfortable shoes,terrible friction against lower achilles tendons! the shoes do not seem to be ergonomically designed. or at least i don't recommend wearing it sockless.
4,Nice Tommy Hilfiger Men's Shoes,The shoes looks very nice and comfortable and at a good price. I recommend it.
1,Bad item,Item looks nothing like picture and it hurts the heels of my feet as well as the back of my foot.
3,R.I.P Big Pun,"This song is a farewell song to big pun, kinda like puff daddy's song for B.I.G.,its a good song and you will probably like it"
4,A great loss...,"Yeah, this song is great...but what a shame that 24K won't ever come out. At least we have the bootleg to listen to..but still, what a shame."
5,one sexy latino,"cuban link is the bomb, first off he is so talented and and in flowers for the dead he shows hes feelings (which is not easy for guys)about how he felt about pun.u know they were close. i would recommend any one who likes pun to pick up cuban links c.d.and his album which will be out the 26th!!!!!!!!! and ladies he is one fine fella"
4,CLK,"His album has aleady came out, just go his website, In his page, his he has two albums to buy and a free autograph by Cuban Link. One album is the 24K, and the other is a Mixtape CD all about CLK's greatest hits. I gotta say the best song till date is track number 11 on his album called "" GO TOE TO TOE"""
5,Pandamonium,"Like many of the older National Geographic videos this film is a treasure. I would highly recommend this tape because of the great amount of information that is contained within it about the titular animal, but also because the film is so charming and relaxing to watch. I should note that the information in this film is dated - then again it is an older film. I bought it simply for the joy of watching it."
4,"Like Schwarzenegger in Terminator, He's Back!!!","After a nine year absence from releasing a studio effort, Frampton is back with NOW. Peter says it best in a line from the seventh track, ""Like Schwarzenegger in Terminator, I'm Back"". And indeed, he is. One of the greatest guitar players of all time has shown is still has it in this new release.The CD has a bit of everything. It starts out with the hard-driving ""Verge of a Thing"", followed by a couple of beautiful ballads; ""Gone But Not Forgotten"" makes us contemplate the days after 9/11, and ""Mia Rose"" will be loved by anyone who has sung a lullabye to their child. George Harrison is also remembered not only in the blazing ""My Guitar Gently Weeps"" cover, but also subtly in the sitar sounds in ""I Need Ground"". For the guitar purists, there is the instrumental ""Greens"". In between are other great songs, including my favorite ""Love Stands Alone"".It is great to hear new music from a talented musician."
4,WONDERFUL,"A TRULY GREAT TALENT NEVER GOES AWAY...THIS DISC IS PROOF OF THAT. A WIDE VARIETY OF MUSICAL STYLES LEADS ONE TO WONDER WHAT FRAMPTON HAD IN MIND WHILE MAKING THIS RECORD, BUT THE RESULT IS REMARKABLE. GREAT MIX OF SONGS AND SOUNDS MAKE THIS A DISC WORTH OWNING. FRAMPTON'S LAST STUDIO ALBUM WAS ALSO REMARKABLE."
5,amazing amazing guitar,"I just got Frampton's NOW and LOVE it. The Greens guitar solo is the best and his guitar version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps is totally amazing. Love love the guitar, want more of it."
4,"Peter Framptons NOw, a great new album","I just bought the new Peter Frampton's album ""NOW"". I have always been a fan of Peter, I actually prefer his later work.I heard a song from his new album called I'm back on the radio last week. So I decided to go the local record store and buy the ablum last night. I was really suprised with it. All the songs seem to have a nice rift to them. His guitar work is exceptional and his voice never sounded better. If your a fan of his later stuff and not his early pop stuff you will really like this album."
3,"now, p frampton","enjoyed the album, but less than I thoght I would. P.f. Is clearly one of the greats, but thus doesnlt show off his guitar skills like I expected. My guitar gently weeps and the track after are definitely the best!"
3,A decent album from Frampton,I would rate this a 2.5 rather than a 3.0 (but they didnt have a 2.5 to choose).
4,My 13 month old daughter loves this!,"My daughter graduated from Baby Mozart, to Elmo, now this. I bought this video when she was 8 months and she didn't start liking it until she was 12 months. This video really captivates her. I can't believe how annoying Barney is, though! Elmo is not as annoying, he's actually cute. With an Elmo video, she pays attention sometimes, but with this, it's like she's possesed! (very scary, actually). She won't move until the video is over. I bought another Barney video today, and she cried when it started playing. She knew it wasn't her favorite. Anyhow, I would recommend this video. Ironically, she really doesn't like Barney on TV! I think it's the kids in the audience that make it, also, it's almost all pure singing which she loves. I will poiont out that my vhs version is terrible."
5,A Great Barney Video,"I borrowed this video from a friend and have to go buy it because my toddler sings long with Barney and sits throught the whole. It is a taping of a live performance somewhere, but it very well done. I recommend this video to any parent whose child loves the songs that Barney sings. There are also a section with a few Wiggles' songs following Barney's performance."
1,"Give It Up, Justin! You Can't Change Clothes!","I saw Barney's Musical Castle in St. Louis, Missouri. Andy, Jessica, and Penny had the same clothes on as in the video. Justin had a rainbow colored shirt on when I saw him in St. Louis, but in the video, he was wearing a red shirt. He still had the same shorts no matter what. He's a teenager and he can't change clothes when he goes from city to city. If he's a teenager, why is he with Barney if Barney is for toddlers? I don't think Justin belongs in this show since he's a teenager and he changes from shirt to shirt. I think the director should have gotten rid of him since he is not good in my opinion."
1,do not hold up,"I bought 2 of these least year. First the ID info came off enroute, then the green rollup part came off coming back. Will not purchase again."
5,held up well in international travel,"I used this ID tag on a ritzy trip to Holland and on a no-frills trip to Kenya. It held up well in all situations, whether carried by a porter and stowed in a bus or lugged around the desert from tiny plane to bumpy jeep. Am buying more for family members traveling to Scotland. Highly recommend!"
1,Hate it! So hard to use!,"In order to write your information on these, you have to unroll them, hold them flat, while trying to write on them, and it is very difficult. I used a fine tip permanent marker, and I had to keep rewriting it, b/c the ink was not sticking. In addition, when I changed my address, unlike other luggage tags where oyu simply insert a new card, this one I had to scrub the old marker off and it didn't all come off, and then try to re-write on top of it. Furthermore, taking it on and off the luggage is extremely difficult and I needed to use a pliers to get it off and back on. I would recommend sticking to a more traditional (flat) luggage tag. I really don't like this one"
1,Too short,"The cable is extremely short. Had to relocate my alternator to fit. For this amount of money, I expected a little bit more cable!"
3,This book is good enough for the exam.,"I used this book to help me study for the exam, however there are several confusing in Questions and answers section. For example, one of the questions was talking about Windows 98/ME while the answer were talkiing about Windows 95 in chapter one exam. Some of the questions will make you think twice before you can answer.I have been working on computers for a number of years. Reading the chapters helps me to find some additional stuff that I did not know. I think it is useful for reading.I also got myself Exam Cram 2 to help me verify some information that I think were missing a few in other book. I just use this book for backup.Lately I have been ordering books from Sybex for my future MCSE exams which I was told they are the best. I read some and found them great. I did not bother to order some from QUE for my future exams."
2,Great Beginnings but Horrible Endings,"This book starts out great, but it seems that the author got a little tired towards the end of the book as the details starts dropping. By the time you reach the end of the book, it seems that you just read a summary of Windows XP, not a book that prepares you for the exam. My rate any MSCE type book using Microsoft Press' version as the ""average"". This one defintely falls below average in terms of technical information. However, there are not a lot of MSCE book available...so it gets two stars instead of one. Get the Microsoft Press' version to prepare for the 70-270."
2,Garbage,"This book does not provide a useful means for passing the 70-270 exam. It glosses over the major aspects of the system, rarely providing the finer details that are necessary for doing well on the exam. Do yourself a favor and try the Exam Cram 2 book instead."
2,Disappointed,"To much bread and not enough meat. Hard to follow, limited illustrations. Material is out of order. For example: The book has you load the operating system and then look into NTFS permissions and security. Unfortunately, it doesn't tell you, until much later, that you must have joined a domain inorder to see the ""Security Tab"". So a reader spends time searching for the security tab. Finally, after researching the internet I found the necessary step. After about 10 pages of further reading I stumble on a note that tells me how to access the security tab. I judge a book by asking myself if I would buy it again. Well I would not buy, or recommend, this book to anyone."
5,This is a very powerful book!,"This book should be required reading for anyone in management, or aspiring to a management position.The book outlines common-sense rules for suceeding during volatile times, but sadly common sense is often lacking in the real world. The authors describe strategies for creating organizations with committed cultures, partnering with customers, practical problem-solving and effective communication. The authors use of case studies from very different types of companies, from FedEx to non-profit hospitals, effectively illustrates how principles from this book can be applied to any organization.Following the principles in this book would help to create a more effective organization and a more positive work life for both managers and staff."
4,Well written and authentic,"The topics and themes in this book are quite common ideals these days, but when this book was written, John Seymour was an iconoclastic idealist. He bucked the trend of wanting everything new, easy-to-use and shiny as a consumer, and he bucked the trend of mechanistic, big business farming. And he can write.Read it if you like gardening or dream of a hobby farm, or if you regularly wear hand-knitted jumpers and bake your own bread. Leave it alone if those things leave you cold."
2,Breaks easily,We used this with our umbrella for a week at the beach. After about 3 days it splinted in half. I was disappointed when it arrived because it was plastic instead of metal but thought we'd give it a try.
1,poor quality,"The handle broke on the third day of our beach vacation. In denser sand near the water, the unit does not screw into the sand without applying some downward pressure, but the handles are weak in that direction. I was careful, knowing that it was plastic, but one handle snapped off anyway."
2,"Short, plastic, not sufficent for the job at hand","I think some of the reviews attached to this product may be for another anchor. This product is not as long as it appears and the plastic is thinner than most I've seen. The fins at the bottom are not wide enough to provide a good ""anchor"". You can get as much support for your umbrella digging a hole with your hand. I'd return it, but after shipping it's not worth the trouble."
2,Broke after three uses,"I bought this before going to the beach, thinking it would still be cheaper than the ones sold by the shore. That was my first mistake. Almost exact copies are sold for $9.99 at the beach, I paid more for this once shipping and handling was taken into account. It worked fine and kept my umbrella from blowing away. In fact, my parents, who have a metal umbrella anchor, kept having their umbrella blow away while my plastic one held fast. But the third day I used it, the plastic handle broke as I was putting it into the sand. It still works for holding the umbrella, but I am mad that it broke already. Also, because I have a very skinny umbrella, the plastic side bulges out when I tighten the screw to hold the umbrella in, so I'm just waiting for that to break as well. I'm going to duct tape the handle so I can hopefully keep using this holder, but if you buy it, be very gentle when putting it into the sand, and I would recommend it for thicker umbrellas."
1,didn't grip sand well,"Tried this in very normal beach sand. After screwing it all the way into the ground, I tried to pull it back out to check how difficult it would be and it came out easily with little effort. Did not even use after that because it was obviously not going to help."
2,"Great design, and price!","Nice to have at the beach, but don't expect it to last over the Summer. If you turn the Plastic screw on the side too tight it will break around the rim."
1,Beware - other reviews on here must be for another item....,"There are a number of reviews on here that apparently must be for another item other than the one shown. Be assured the item does NOT have a removable handle..... AT ALL. It also DOES NOT HAVE MORE THAN TWO FINS. So when one of them BREAKS OFF after only using it a small number of times, it's no good anymore. Piece of junk. Not sure what the other people on here are reviewing but I'd love to get one of those with the removable handle or with the 3 fins. This one just isn't it. If you want something that lasts..... buy something else."
2,Not as advertised,"First use in Myrtle Beach, SC. Picture is nothing like Sand Anchor I recieved. No removable handle and not as long as shown. We thought we had unit well screwed in place and completely burried. (using an 8 ft. umbrella), but in two hours time we had to chase it down. They were normal breezes associated with the beach, not high winds. I had another gentlemen come over and tell me not to waste my time with it, he told me he had the same experience. I borrowed the digging iron the life gaurd used to put up the rental umbrellas and installed umbrella without the anchor. We were MUCH more satisfied with the results. I would not recommend spending $20 (including shipping) for this. It may work better on a small umbrella...? As a side note I also saw another person with a similar device the following day, and they also chased down their umbrella."
4,Lasted 5+ years,"I got one of these, oh, it must be 5 or 6 years ago. This works better than shorter versions for looser sand found closer to the dunes on North Carolina's outer banks (the shorter ones work just fine most places). I've used it 4 or 5 days a year on average. Two of the three fins broke last week. It still works with one fin but I don't expect that fin to last too much longer :-) I bought this for $4 at a beach shop in October and am hoping to get a similar deal this year. Actually, I was hoping for a similar deal online but haven't come across one yet..."
1,Cheaply made,"The most important and only moving part of this anchor, the plastic tightener, broke into two pieces the very first time we used it. We would have returned it had not a mechanically-oriented friend jury-rigged a replacement part."
3,worked before it broke,"I bought it along with a different style beach umbrella anchor (rio brand)Rio Sports Sand Anchorfor our recent vacation. I will say that this one held the umbrella better, but the wall of the anchor is thinner. After 3 to 4 uses one of the handles broke off while I was screwing it in."
3,Not So Sure.....,"Bought this with the intent of it working well in the sand, and at the park or soccer field.It has a pretty sturdy design made of plastic, but the diameter is so large, that I can't use iton the soccer fields without leaving a gaping hole in the ground. It wasn't expensive, so for beach use it's great. Don't try it anywhere other than the beach. You might not even be able to get it into the ground."
5,Excellent product,"Works great, you have to push down as you turn, arrived last week and used this weekend for our fishing poles at the beach. Easily fit our surf poles with room to spare. Would recommend this, great deal for this price."
3,Very convenient but broke quickly,"This anchor is very convenient; thanks to its wide bottom, it held my umbrella even against very strong wind (I've also tried another model made of steel, but that one had a spire-like bottom, so strong wind was able to pull the anchored umbrella out of the sand). However, it started to crumble after I used it less than 30 times; it's still usable and will probably survive another 5-7 times. This is the second time I purchased this item, the first one (white) lasted about 50 times. Of course I'm not too happy with the item's longevity, but, considering that I paid just $10 bucks including the shipping, I think buying this item still makes sense."
3,Judging the book by the cover,"This is a fine book for what it is, which is a history written in the 19th century. But look at the cover- doesn't it look fairly modern? If you buy this book expecting history into the 20th century, you will obviously be disappointed."
3,Difficult to read,"It's an enjoyable book, if dated, but the pages are of variable quality as they were clearly just scanned into a computer. Some are literally unreadable, while others are in decent shape. There has to be a better way to get this back into print."
1,there is much better stuff,"Having stumbled over the ""buddha bar"" series this year and purchasing much of it along with many similarly themed collections, like this one, I can say there are some real winners and losers - this is one of the losers. It's just one track after another of not very impressive creations. If there can be such a thing as sophmoric chillout music then this is it. A few other winners are Nirvannah Lounge, most anything by Claude Challe, David Visan and for a treat check out Deep Forest."
4,grandson enjoys playing with this and it helps occupy them in a car.,"it helps with dexterity, colors counting the pegs, it is a toy that is played with frequently, i have 2 grandsons and both enjoy it, one is 2 and the other is 8. recommend this for interactive play too!"
3,Up Up and Away,"Ok, so we have the best Air Hog story. This is all my 8 yr old wanted for his birthday. Super excited when he opened it! We took it to the park... mom, dad, 2 brothers, a friend and Bailey the Beagle. He turned it on.. and up it went... it went left.. it went right... it went up... it went down... so far... seemed awesome. Then he flew it straght.. up it went... it flew.. and flew.. and flew... out of remote control range... everybody running after it... it went past the park.. over houses... toward an open field... even the dog got winded. Going.. going.. gone. We never saw it again, even after a few search parties. Words of wisdom... if the plane starts to get ""out of control""...you might want to shut it off WITH the remote control. Overall review... pretty expensive solo flight."
4,Don't expect too much from a $30 R/C plane,"I have the Intruder. I've flown it 5 or 6 times. It does fly. Let's clear some things up:1) It's made of ""flimsy"" foam. Yes, but there's a reason for this - it has to be light. It could have been made out of heavier material, but then it wouldn't fly.2) It takes a couple of seconds to ""get into gear"". It's programmed to ignore user input for the first couple of seconds so that it can gain altitude before the user starts to turn it.If you throw it straight it should fly straight and gain altitude. If it doesn't, then either it's too windy or the plane needs trimming by bending the rudder a bit.I fly ""real"" R/C planes for my hobby, and easily spend over $400 for a plane, radio and batteries. To spend $30 for a R/C plane is quite amazing, please realize that. Don't expect this plane to act like a $500 plane, do expect it crash occasionally and it might require some glue or tape for repairs."
1,peice of junk.,This toy is a peice of junk. it will fly down but it doesnt go up. when it turns it falls from the air like a rock.
2,don't get it,this plane doesn't work!! i flew it the first time and it worked fine. the next day i flew it again and it stayed up in the air for maybe 10 seconds. the battery was already dying!! don't get this plane unless you want to return it. its a little too expensive for its performance. i would not reccommend buying it
1,THIS IS THE WORST TOY I HAVE EVER SEEN,"When I got this so called ""toy"" I was expecting it to actually have some power. Instead it wouldnt even charge until my dad took it apart and found there was a loose wire. The controls are soggy even in a standstill mode when I got it charged. This plane just dived and crashed less than a second from when I got it into the air. DO NOT,I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS DISGRACE OF A PLANE. It is a total waste of your money. This is a rotten-to- the-core toy."
1,It Broke on the first flight,The nose and wings broke off on first flight. (By flight I mean nosediving 3 seconds after launch) Made of cheap styrofoam.
1,Don't buy this toy,"I bought this for my son and, after 45 minutes, both he and his father finally gave up trying to get it off the ground. It flew in a straight line for approximately 15 feet before falling to the ground like a brick! It was a fairly calm day so that may have contributed to the problem, but kids won't check the weather before bringing out a toy to play! I brought it back the next day."
1,This plane will not fly!!,My son got this plane for his birthday. He was so excited and bugged me to let him fly it. So I put the batteries in and charged the plane only to find out that the plane would not fly. No matter what I did the plane would not go up. After reading the other reviews of this plane I have decided not to bother with it anymore and am taking it back.
1,THIS IS NOT A FUN TOY!!!,"This plane is difficult to get to start going and then once it goes for a very SHORT distances then crashes. The directions tell you about how to land, NOT....this thing does not have the battery power to land, you are lucky to get to fly for a couple of seconds....NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"
1,It SUCKS,"it stinks the atena breaks eaisly, it is hard to get it flying, the paint fleck very easily, and it doesn't look like the boxes picture. If you ask me i would say to save your money and buy a better one."
3,Totally Crazy Wicked Cool Thingy That Flies,"The Air Hogs Defender was the first RC plane i had ever got. I went to the park to fly it with my mum and brother but at first it did not seem to work. Again and again i tried unti finally I got it going. It was CRAZY!!!! But after a while and lots of crashes the tip of the wing broke, but it was still ok.Overall this plane is very good as it combines light weight materials with high strength materials thus resulting in a Totally Crazy Wicked Cool Thingy That Flies!!!Tip: If you cant get it going try throwing it up a bit more, this worked for me"
3,Frustrating but fun,"I purchased this product in the hopes of getting enough practice and experience to move on to the bigger RC planes. While it takes a while to learn how to manuver you can still have alot of fun. Don't let frustration set in with the short amount of battery charge, you will be crashing alot more than flying but keep remembering how much fun you are having when you actually get to fly."
1,Save your money and avoid this toy.,"I purchased this airplane, as I had always wanted one since childhood. In my mind I was sure I would have hours of enjoyment and playtime with my son. What I sadly discovered was that after approximately 20 minutes of trying to get the plane to fly and not nosedive directly into the ground (Yes I did charge it twice prior to the 1st flight)the plane was not durable and fractured at the tail. Now I did not think I was buying the world's best plane for 30.00 bucks, however I expected more then 20 minutes of failed flying. The educational value for this one was outstanding as I was able to reinforce with my son the age old lesson of you get what you pay for avoid paying for this one and look to a higher grade plane."
5,THE PERFECT TOY,when I got this toy I was amazed (...) I figured it was a hunk of junk but boy was I soooo wrong. It was so cool I absolutely loved it!!!!! I have to get another one because mine had an incident with a river.
4,Great Gift for a Great Boss,"This book first came to my attention because of a very creative interview with the author on CNBC in which their female commentators-in Elizabethan costume-read passages from this book, the actual words of Queen Elizabeth I, according to the author, one of the greatest CEO's of all time. He makes a strong case for that view in his discussion of the financial disarray of England at the time of Elizabeth's ascencion contasted with the wealthy and glorious empire she created, surviving assasination attempts, plagues, and medieval male chauvinism along the way. What moved me most, however, were Elizabeth's own words revealing her philosophy of leadership: how she inspired, motivated and cared for her flock. My thought was to give this book to my own ""Fearless Leader"" (read:boss) so she might see that she's employing the techniques pioneered by the great Elizabeth I."
1,Just Plain Bad!!,"This book is a combo of business self-help and facile history. You won't learn much history, and the business lessons are just plain unconvincing. I'm one-fourth of the way through this book and just can't finish it!"
1,Cotton candy,"I'm interested both in history & in business, so I was very much looking forwards to this book. Now that I've gotten halfway through, I've realized that it is basically sugar coated fluff. It's a collection of modern management homilies illustrated with cute little stories about Elizabeth I. I was hoping for a dicussion of the problems and opportunities she faced, with an in-depth discussion of how she and her people addressed them, which is not at all what is offered. It's a pity, because she did live in very interesting times and an insightful exposition could be quite valuable - perhaps someone will write the book I was hoping to read someday.If you have extra time & enjoy stories, this is worth reading, otherwise don't bother."
2,"Great topic, but trite outcome","In fairly short order Elizabeth I moved a kingdom from near bankruptcy to the Golden Age. She touched every aspect of her world from politics, art, religion/spirituality, to science. In light of the challenges faced by modern business leaders, Elizabeth provides an intriguing roadmap to excellence, integrity, and success; however, this book approaches Elizabeth's leadership style in a trite and shallow way, with very little analysis of her strategies or how they apply to issues faced by business leaders of our time. The book is a bathroom reader at best."
2,Close but no Cigar,"The author was on to a good idea with drawing from a well known historical figure and applying it to todays business world. Unfortunately the delivery has to be improved.The book cover says ""strategic"", but I saw nothing strategic about it. It reads like a cook book. A pinch of this a dash of that and you are on your way to being an effective leader. He also repeatedly draws on the same tool chest of examples to illustrate his points. You would think that after rules for all 40+ years there would be more to draw upon.On the upside I gained some insight on the historical aspects of the Elizabethan era."
5,Must Read,"Axelrod has done it again! Elizaabeth I, CEO is a must read, especially for those of you, like me, who enjoy a bit of history tossed in with your leadership lessons. It's nice to know that all this leadership stuff has some historical perspective. Axelrod does a super job making history relevant to the present. It's well put together too, and a page-turner. You won't use it to replace your sleep aids."
5,Interesting book,book arrived in timely manner and good condition. really enjoyed the book. like the way the author compares Elizabeth's life to business world.
3,"Interesting, But Not Stimulating.","""Elizabeth I: CEO"" draws dozens of business lessons from the life and actions of Queen Elizabeth I. Much if this book is biographical. Those segments of the book filled gaps in my knowledge about Queen Elizabeth and the tangled family of her father, Henry VIII.The book is organized into dozens of business maxims which are then supported by examples from Elizabeth's life and career.One test I apply to books is whether they whet my appetite to read more. This one fails that test. I enjoyed it but do not have a thirst to know more about management theory. While I might read more about Queen Elizabeth, it is not a priority. This is a worthwhile book, but not if you have something you really want to read."
5,Take a lesson,"One of my dormmates gave me this book when she found out I was a business major and I loved it. While the world has changed since Elizabeth was on the throne, the basic rules of the game still apply. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a head at work."
1,Not at all mess-free,"This stuff is way too messy. If my seven year old touches the paper the black ink? gets on his hands, then to the table, clothes, etc. The stencil it comes with is junk, thin cardboard that ripped the first time he drew with it. Not worth the money!"
3,Crayola Color Explosion Twin Pack,This is fun. But it doesn't work as well as I hoped. You must use a black marker they supply. when you rub the marker over the paper the color below is revealed. At times the marker didn't work. We had to rub it back and fourth over and over.
1,What a mess!,"This product looks like great fun, and after having seen how much fun the Crayola ""Color Wonder"" product was, you'd think Color Explosion would be too. It's a mess. The stencils are flimsy thin ""cardboard"" that's more like paper. The black coating comes off all over hands, clothes, furniture. Even if your kids are careful, non-messy (hahahahahaaa! yeah, right), one touch and their hands will have stains that don't wash off. At least regular crayola markers typically wash off hands decently well. This black goo does not. I would never buy this product again."
5,excellent dewalt combo kit,Everything was perfect. Top of the line tools for a great price. I could not of asked for a greater Christmas gift.
3,headset review,This headset is very nice if you like a clamp on your head that forces loud noise to your ears. The volume button doesn't change to a quiet enough setting and it is too loud for me use for more than about 5 minutes.
1,Very poor quality,"Though very inexpensive, the cost of postage makes this DVD a poor choice, when you could purchse it at WalMart for just a dollar with a much better picture."
2,...Martin Sheen? You've got to be kidding.,"This movie may have some artistic value, but Martin Sheen's politicking is enough to make any faithful Catholic avoid this film!"
3,Used this to make a snowgun,Used these nozzles to make a snowmaker due to the unseasonably dry and warm winter we're having. They work OK but have a very low water flow rate. That severely limits their effectiveness.
4,Excellent primer on automatons and mechanical toys,"Profusely illustrated on nearly every page, this classic book on the subject of mechanical toys and automatons (which cannot rightly be considered ""toys"") is perfect for someone just starting their research into this magical world. Hillier covers the complete history of mechanical figures, from Ancient Egypt to modern battery-operated robots. The majority of the book is spent on Victorian-era automata and early 20th century mechanical toys. There is a small section of color plates, listing of manufacturers and their marks, and a thorough bibliography. Highly recomended!"
1,propaganda at its best,"An absolute sham of a book, that provides the necessary literature and propaganda to colonise a gullible, dependent mind.This book does not give an opinion from a zimbabwean point of view and thus it is not credible.If you talk of zimbabwe, talk to zimbabweans and then form an opinion.The author is neither educated in the politics of rhodesia or zimbabwe, as the clauses in the Lancaster house agreement are not mentioned, which play a big part in zimbabwe's present problems.This woman should first receive an education, and then an independent mind before any of her publications should be purchased.All the material that is there, you probarbly could read it on BBC or CNN, our daily propaganda machines.This book is DEFINATELY NOT WORTH IT!!!"
1,Absurd and racist Book,"This book has no credibility nor insight on the sufferings of the black Zimbabwean. This piece of literature encourages the servant-master relationship that has characterised Zimbabwe, ten years after independence. The author has delibarately neglected to mention the dominant role that the whites have played in Zimbabwe up to this point of intervention by Robert Mugabe. It is likely that the author himself is embittered by the compulsory land acquisition, because it is likely one of his farms or family members farms has been occupied by the black Zimbabwean people who for more than ten years after independence, are still landless, and dependant on the whites. Mugabe's endeavours to change the current injustices have resulted in his depiction as a tyrant, and a racist. The racists are those, such as the author who disregard Mugabe's efforts to bring about true independence and equality in Zimbabwe and all Africa. Mugabe is not a racist, nor tyrant, merely a great nationalist!"
4,Cute! Fun for girls!,Def. a cute little product. I got these and the MP3 during the holidays. They were such a great deal. My daughter likes it but its kinda hard to learn how to use. Cute for the price though!
4,"Cute, but what they don't tell you...","These are very cute for the tweens that have a Barbie Girl MP3 player. You can change out her hair and clothing. What they don't tell you (and I didn't realize until it was home with me) is that it's only the faceplate. You still have to buy the backplate seperately.The faceplates are also slightly difficult for the younger ones to change out by themselves. The 6 yr old had a hard time, but it wasn't a problem for the 12 yr old."
4,Good Variety of Recipes,"The history of Ice Cream and the information about making homemade ice cream was good. The variety of recipes is great. I just have one complaint. This book, like most, only gives the recipe to make one gallon."
1,This is not what I expected at all!!!! Better to have gone to the bookstore.,This book is not much to behold. There is little in this book that I found useful.
5,Tons of delicious fun,I got this book for a gift for someone. They seem to be enjoying it and we had some homemade chocolate chip-cherry (real cherrys and real chocolate chips) ice cream. Delicious.
5,Fun :-),I bought this for my kids. I remember well making ice cream as a kid growing up and the recipes in here both bring back fond memories and introduce new flavors.
3,It is ok,"I ordered this item with an ice cream maker mostly to make it to the amount for free shipping, so basically got it free after the savings in shipping. This was helpful, but most ice reciepes are quite similar so save your money and look on the net if you need a recipe or pick one from the book with the ice cream maker. I had had hopes of making a more creamy ice cream home made, but I think the somewhat icy texture of the results are the nature of the beast."
3,Surprised how thin it is!,"I expected a thicker book. The recipes are fine - as my husband said, how many ice-cream recipes do you need? so, it's ok - we'll use it, bought it to go with our 6 qt ice cream maker - just know when it arrives it's paper back and something like 17 pages...."
4,Old-Fashioned Homemade Ice Cream,This book presents with approximately 50 recipes to prepare ice cream at home with some insightful advice.
3,Disgruntlement,"Lots of invective and some sublime writing that ultimately leads nowhere. Your point, Mr. Rushdie?"
3,Something of a disappointment,"I'm a great admirer of Rushdie's writing, but I was somewhat disapppointed with Fury. Although it grew on me as I made my way through it, it's several notches below Midnight's Children and The Moor's Last Sigh.Problem 1: Rushdie's eagerness to display his mastery of American pop culture is so much in the forefront that it's obtrusive. Read the first chapter and you'll see what I mean. Constant -- and self-conscious -- references to Britney Spears, Marky Mark, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Leonardo DiCaprio, etc. are shoved to the foreground. In addition to being a distraction, this likely will make Fury become dated quickly."
2,Disappointed by my favorite author,"I have read most of Rushdie's books. This one, to me, was the worst. I give it two stars because there are some parts that are funny and (very) occasionally there is some insight into American culture. But the book felt mostly as if he was execersing his vocabulary, lacking any depth whatsoever."
1,Save your money,"This book is an interesting study in how little work you need to do to get published if you have a brand name like Mr. Rushdie's. Mr. Rushdie, interested primarily in showing off his worldliness and making sweeping judgements on the state of things, misses the mark repeatedly and comes off as a wide-eyed arriviste completely blinded by the glitz. He has no personal reference point for New York and any reader who knows a bit about the city will immediately feel herself in the fraudulent company of a novice trying to pass off as an expert. This makes the wordplay and bombast and topical commentary especially untenable. Oh yes, he throws in a ""murder mystery"" as a plea to readers to stay with him through his gratuitous ramblings. Overall, the book reads like a first novel your college roommate wrote after visiting New York City for the first time."
4,"unusual, but not for Rushdie","I always hesitate to pick up a Rushdie as my next read. I have trouble settling in to his language and conventions, having to reread until I can catch his rhythm. This is the first Rushdie (besides Haroun and the Sea of Stories, but that's more elementary) that I could read without turning the pages backward.Malik Solanka is inventor of a modern-day Dora the Explorer who's been turned Bratz by commercialism. Fearing the rage that burns inside him, he leaves his London life and attempts to disappear into the unbranded rush of New York City only to find his internal furor replaced by a much larger external one.I couldn't help thinking ofHeart of Darknessand the twisted trip down the Congo, with itsApocalypse NowMarlon Brando looming at the end. As the story escalates, so do Solanka's shadowy strangers-come-friends (accomplices?) and bizarro never-never-land of Fury."
2,Unimpressed.,I read and loved Rushdie's 'The Ground Beneath Her Feet' and have since tried other Rushdie books with varying degrees of success. 'Fury' was extremely disappointing. I simply did not believe the characters. Try instead: 'The Ground Beneath Her Feet'.
2,sal is a short story writer,"rushdie's indubitably a dude (everyone on the london scribe scene adores him) but jeez the guy is a short story writer (EAST/WEST is completely brilliant), not a novelist. Fury's just as infuriatingly unfinishable as was Midnight's Children (by Krishna, the guy tries SO hard), the dreadful and ploddy Moor's Last Sigh, and the breakneckedly beginning/quickly petering Satanic Verses...keep on writing for Granta and the New Yorker,Sal--hanging with U@ and being a chumly chum...but please stop him from writing any more big books. go read V2 Naipaul's A House for Mr Biswas, everybody. cheers"
1,A Waste of Time & Attention,"I disliked the book intensely and feel cheated of the time it took me to decipher it.This is the first novel of Rushdie I have read and, based on this experience, I'll nevertry another. The book leaves this reader completely disengaged. There is not a single human characterin it; they are all ""dolls"", cardboard cutouts. Occasional clever or witty remarks and asides do not redeem it.Rushdie seems to collect book prizes like others do boxtops. I can only wonder why."
1,Never again,"I read Satanic Verses because of all the hype and controversy. I hated it. I decided to give Rushdie another try and picked up 'Fury'. Being that the book is relatively short, I thought I could breeze through it in a matter of a few days. Wrong! After 75 agonizing pages, I put the book down and now use it as a coffee cup coaster. Rushdie is an ego-maniacal fraud with extremely limited talent as a writer. If not for the death sentence by the Ayatollah Khomaini, then Rushdie would just be another no name writer in England. After this debacle, I'll never read another of his novels again."
4,"Not as fanciful as his others, but very timely","As others have written, this is not as robust a book as some of Rushdie's other novels, but I was very moved by the intimacy you felt with this book. It was equally as vivid a capture of its charachters and their internal dilemas. Perhaps even better. It's also a particularly eerie book to read post-September 11th.All in all, I really appreciated Fury. It was dark and sad, but not just for its own sake."
2,Oh Rushdie where art thou?,"I adore Salman Rushdie. I have read all of his books, stories and the majority of his articles. I generally devore them, savor each line and word, and simply can't put them down.The minute I heard that he had a new book out I ran out and bought it that same day. Unfortunatly it turned out to be less enthralling than his other works. It was disturbing the way the Sept. 11th attacks appear, it certainly touched a nerve.This is a dark book, but lacks the ability to laugh at life, and find passion that are hallmarks of his other works.I had trouble getting through this one, I didn't enjoy it as much as ""The Ground Benieth her Feet"" or ""Haroun and the Sea of Stories.""It is a good, solid book, but it didn't live up to the hype and expectation of his name. I even saw it on a Newsweek worst of 2001 list, how uncharacteristic is that?Make of it what you will, I still wait on baited breath for his next work...."
1,One star for audacity,"Apparently, Rushdie's fame has given him the audacity to write such bombastic and boring drivel as this."
1,Yawn,"Back when I was in University in the 80s, I thought Salman Rushdie was the Business. I used to parade around with my ""Free Salman Rushdie"" button, all political and hip. I was really looking forward to reading this book, and was disappointed. Yes, he's clever; Yes, he's of the moment; Yes, he's satirical ... but so what? I was not gripped, held, pulled into this tale. In fact, quite the opposite - I put this book down 1/3 of the way through. NEXT."
3,Ego lit.,"August 14, 2002This was my first time reading Rushdie and I found'Fury' a bit of an uphill push. The novel exists soundlywithin the self-satisfied genre of ""Man-Of-LettersEgo Literature"", lacking for plot and sometimessubstituting charicature for character. As in manycontemporary novels, grocery lists of pop culturereferences are too often spotlighted as clever satire.That said, the book contains some truly stirring,thought-provoking rants, observations, andarguments about the unsatisfying, schizophreniccircus that is modern America. Could have madefor a few better short stories or magazinearticles, but perhaps Mr. Rushdie had a bookobligation."
2,Down and Out in London and New York,"Something made Salman Rushdie, an author of prodigious talents, have to write this book, but you don't have to read it. Rushdie's ""Midnight's Children"" and ""The Satanic Verses"" soar with their larger than life characters, rich depictions of the Indian subcontinent, lyrical prose, and magic realism, and they tell fine stories. ""Fury,"" by contrast, is a ruminating monologue, a screed, which wrestles darkly with American mass culture, the overclass, personas, the political pretensions of the Indian diaspora, intellectual honesty, and the dilemma of love.There is narrative heat here but precious little light. Rushdie's characters fail to engage. His issues fail to resolve. A tragedy worthy of the Greek Furies, who horribly punish unavenged crimes, utterly fails to develop. Unless you happen to be writing your dissertation on Rushdie, you can safely pass on ""Fury."""
4,"""...Like a Doll Scorned""","I only just read FURY for the first time, and my tardiness finds Salman Rushdie's book now embedded in a post 9/11 English speaking world that is at ""war"" against terrorism, with the author being lately knighted, provoking a renewed fatwa on his life. I can't help thinking that reading FURY at this time led me to a different perspective from those reading it upon its publication in 2001.Many others have pointed out that FURY is not Salman Rushdie's finest work, but it is still a fabulous read. I found it to be intelligent and moving, if at times unnecessarily difficult. This group of Rushdie's characters seems completely modern yet with a timeless feel. Rushdie's plot once again revolves around alter-realities; sometimes cultural, but mostly psychological, and I found the doll trope particularly attractive.If you've read Rushdie I highly recommend FURY, if not, begin with MIDNIGHT""S CHILDREN or the incomparable SATANIC VERSES."
2,Sorry but it's a failure for a superb writer like Rushdie,"I have eagerly enjoyed all of Mr. Rushdie's previous books. Some were excellent, some were simply good or at least worth reading. This is simply bad. I'm sorry to say this, for I really think Rushdie is an outstanding writer, but this book is sort of a bizarre patchwork that only my loyalty to its author(and the hope that it might improve as I progressed through it, which it did not)prevented me from turning down half way through.Don't waste your time, read any other of his books instead."
1,Overwrought and superficial,"The metaphor of fury is a nice a idea, but just doesn't pan out for all of America. Rushdie skims over the surface of things, but doesn't really get past the consumer culture facade he tries to creakily prop up and lampoon. The protagonist is the only character with any depth. Also, the murder and coup subplots are just plain unbelievable. The book reads like a hasty, cutsey, journalistic first draft.Finally, the events of 9/11 make the whole book seem dated."
2,Contrived and disappointing,"I was excited to pick up Fury, having read other books by Rushdie and also based on the premise of the book. I was so disappointed, I almost didn't finish it, and I bet I could have guessed the ending had I cared enough to try. I felt like I was being hit over the head with all of the obvious analogies and, since the book is entitled ""Fury,"" there's really no need to keep referring to the fury within, the Furies, fury of the city, fury of lust/passion/pain. We get it! And yes, we all know that America in the 21st century is a vast wasteland--move on and get to the point of the story. Assuming there is one."
1,This book fills an important NICHE...,"...namely for all the people that flunked out of elementary algebra and can't figure out how to size cabinet parts for themselves. Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy either udo schmidt's, jim tolpin's or danny proulx's books on cabinetmaking as they provide much more useful information beyond cutlist and assembly instructions. Keeping in mind that a standard wall cabinet is 12"" deep and that a standard base cabinet is 24"" deep and that both are often 30"" high (excluding toe kick), you can EASILY fill in the rest of the dimensions by downloading a PDF file on cabinet dimensions from any of the major cabinet companies like merillat or mill's pride but in general most of the widths are in 3"" increments beginning with 12"" and up to 48"". You can easily replace this entire book with the innovative FREE ecabinets program from thermwood."
2,Definitely for first time woodworker's only,"The book is well manufacturing and will last for quite a while so you won't lose out on quality. It is glossy and well illustrated however it lacks content for anyone who has built a cabinet or two. It does contain some good points on basic cabinet construction that will be beneficial to someone just starting woodworking however if you are looking for construction details on lots of different styles this is not the book for you. The book contains a lot of the same thing with many construction sheets repeated with only minor changes to a single dimension. For example pages 20 to 27, which contain 28 separate construction sheets (one per page), have exactly the same cabinet illustration and cutting list with one minor change in width on each sheet. This pattern appears to be repeated throughout the book (e.g. pages 32-39, 44-59). However like I said it is well made and would be a good first reference but is definitely not for anyone above beginner level."
3,The complete Cabinet Maker's Reference,"This book is great for intermediate and beginers cabinet makers as long as you use their demensions then this book is great, but not all situations fall into their dimensions but as always you can deviate some to fit your situation. But all and all a great referance."
5,Heartwarming,"I have read several other books with the same theme, however this book surpasses them all. Our copy is well loved and our guests tend to migrate toward it at our home. The book contains the stories of several people and how dogs have touched their lives. It is a glimpse into personal collections of avid dog lovers and collectors."
4,A story about a woman's loss and how (& why) she lives on.,"The author writes about a woman named Marie Kuraki. Marie suffers the worst kind of losses imaginable. Yet, she never gives up on life. She is devoted and relentless in the pursuit of her beliefs -- a modern day saint. Despite her reputation for selflessness, she refuses to succomb to her image as a saint and steadfastly presents herself as a woman -- a human being at all times. Oe presents her story in a detailed, loving, and non-glorifying manner.It's a great read, but brace yourself, Marie's losses are devastating."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","I ussually finish a book I start, and this book was no exception. I think the reason I decided to read it is because its author won the Nobel Prize in 1994, and one should read something by such winnners--tho there are many I have not, yet, read anything by. This book tells of a tragedy which Marie suffers and how she is devastated by it. It also tells of her promiscuous sex life, and of her flitting from one interest to another, but I could not care about her and while the translation is eminently readable I kept thinking ""why should I care about this woman?"" I never found an answer. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an interesting experience. So why did I write this? Since there are only two reviews I thought one should get another viewpoint on the book."
1,EXPIRED,I would loved to have use this VERY EXPENSIVE milk for my 5 month old but i cant. IT EXPIRED 10/01/2012. How are you going to allow yourself to sell this. Thats like poisioning a baby. I would give 0 stars but it wont let me. What a shame you are
4,So good I had to buy another,This product gets the job done. Put it through a lot of abuse and it kept cutting away. Cuts were clean and neat. No problems except the fact I need another one for the shop.
4,"Fishfinder, 90 Portable with dual Beam by Garmin","the unit works great, but the rubber suction cup is hard to keep mounted to the transom of the boat."
5,Great reference,"For those of us who don't want to have to find out when the local art school has models coming in, or don't want to look at tons of porn trying to find something for reference, this book and its predecessors are perfect."
4,I bought it for school.,"I like the poses this book had to offer, and I like that you can move them around on the CD. I wish you could change it from other angles though, not just side to side.However, there were a few things that bugged me. I haven't looked at the other books though, so maybe those cover it. The main thing was that the models in this book are mostly skinny females. While it helps to see the curves, I would like to see more variety in body type. I would also like to see more variety in gender and racial background."
2,"does the job, but background is horrible","The 360 degree rotating is great, some poses could be more interesting, some are too similar to each other. The women modeling are pretty much the same, same bone structure, similar weight, skin color, ethnicity and age. There is only one young male model, and one older male model. That part was really disappointing. And what it bother me the most was the background color. in all the pictures is the same, white!. A darker color, gray or black on any other color for that matter would be great! the fact that all the models are REALLY white becomes obnoxious. At certain points the background blends with their sking color, making it hard to differentiate one from the other. With a different background the model would ""pop-out"", and the artist's eyes would easily focus on his/her subject."
1,Disappointing,Great idea but poor execution. The photos are much too small to do any serious work with. The photos on disk are grainy and get even worse when you try to enlarge them.
3,Not helpful,"I actually purchased this book hoping to glean from it some ideas not about drawing, but of photography. I have been pursuing my hobby of portrait taking for some years now, and have had the opportunity to expand into the realm of female nude photography at the request of some friends. However, both I and the models lack the knowledge of how to pose for these pictures, so I was hoping to get some ideas. In that respect, this book falls short of that goal. It would be a good book for artists, especially with the disc (assuming it functions properly), but isnt very helpful for budding amateur photographers."
3,Great pose reference,"I need this book for a class and was excited when I got it. I'm horrible at drawing the human figure and need references like this to help me, I do agree that the light source is a bit much but if you think about it you really need an all around view of the figure this way you aren't limited to just one light source to branch off from, if you are skilled enough you can make the light come from any angle. This book isn't for kids or people who get queezy when seeing the naked body."
5,excellent resource for beginners and pros,Its hard for artists to find a good model without having to pay a fortune. This book is reasonably priced and offers a variety of interesting poses from all angles. I'm a beginner myself and have gained tremendous perspecive from using this guide. I also gave the book as a gift to a professional artist friend and he uses it on a regular basis as well. this book has saved me time and money in persuing my art.
3,Not so hot.,"Whether or not a book is good is a very subjective matter, and comparing one book to another even more so. However, this book in my opinion does not hold a candle to the author's other book which is ""Red Sky at Morning."" I bought the book because of Red Sky and because other reviewers, some of them, really liked this one. I think Red Sky is a masterpiece of American fiction although perhaps one has to be from the Southwest, particularly New Mexico, to think it is as good as I think it is. ""So Far From Heaven"" is a workaday novel but nothing special."
3,Good introductory book,"The book addresses the fundamental concepts of home networking with generous visual guide. It is a good book for those who wish to learn or refresh networking principles.Beyond that, it is very limited."
1,Misleading advertisment,"This company, Yamper Fun, seems to be new and doesn't understand honest advertising. I was excited to see this product selling for a discounted price. Then I received an email from the company saying they canceled my order. I needed this product for a birthday party next week and now I won't have it in time. I wouldn't recommend using this company to anyone. They won't follow through on what they advertise."
5,"Refreshing, truthful look at stale patterns with partners","This book is a wonderful, wonderful expose of the stale, stuck patterns that we often get locked into in our intimate relationships.....the Moseleys have done a brillant job of unmasking the patterns that keep us locked in power struggles and out of the intimacy that we desire. And they give ways to break out of these destructive patterns and move forward in positive ways. And they give historical perspectives on how these patterns began and why they are so hard to spot. For anyone on a journey of self awareness, this is a must read.... insightful, truthful and brillant."
1,feeling a little depressed,I am not sure the methods that the Moseleys use are altogether helpful for me. After reading this book I was left feeling very depressed and hopeless. Which they state in the later part of their book is what they expect. Altogether not a very positive book. I don't plan to spend the next 10 years rehasing what has gone on for the last 20. I will look for a more inspiring book that looks to the possibilities in the future rather than dwell on the past.
3,"Beautiful, if voyeuristic, look at wonderful homes","You won't find help in finding or creating your own house by the sea in this book, but you'll get to look at lovely examples of other people's seaside homes. Depending on your mood or income, this may be relaxing -- or drive you mad with jealousy."
3,Elizabeth,"If I remember rightly,some boy was all upset that Elizabeth didn't like him so he stole her diary and wrote all this garbage in it to make her look awful.I'm sure thats what it was about."
2,unsatisfied,"The CD worked at first, but as you got into higher levels of the game, the sound did not work. The sound did not work when you were at a level that you needed to click on the characters and have them answer your questions."
3,Forgot the photographers,The sad thing about this book is that all the photographers that contributed work to the original exhibtion were not listed anywhere. Very ungenerous of the editor.
2,mashed together tragic visions...,"This is a fine tribute, but it should be kept as a memorial or a showcase. This isnt a book for memorializing, it is a book of pictures FROM the memorial that was set up by Mr. Feldschuh. It is sometimes hard to see, many pictures are blurry and hard to make out. A lot of the pictures or captions are cut off as they are trying to represent what the gallery was.If you are looking for a good book to remember the terrible fate we beheld, go for ""One Nation"" absolutly riviting, from cover to cover!"
4,Good shorts for price,I got the maroon shorts. I think it is a good price for what we got. The material is a little thin which you can see in the product picture.
2,Tore quickly,"These shorts tore in the seam between the legs within a few weeks of having bought them. And there really wasn't much use given to them (certainly nothing that would cause a tear). I like Adidas shorts overall, but I can't recommend these."
4,slightly tight fit,"I bought these Trussi shorts as a gift for my husband. He is a size 31 so I ordered a medium. These shorts fit a little tight but still wearable. I wish I had ordered a large for him. Other than the tight fit, he likes these shorts. The color (i got a black pair) and the fabric look cool."
4,A fair Avengers novel,This is a good Avengers novel but the scenes are very slow.If you don't have patients than you probibly should not read this.
2,Well written but it lacks the sparkle and wit of the Avenger,"The color cover photo of Rigg and MacNee is pleasing. However; the book lacked the humor found in the series and in Kaewert's delightfully adapted movie tie-in. There are descriptions of the gourmet food Steed and Emma consume and a preposterous scheme to deceive two ruthless fascist villains by use ofa filmstrip projector. (That technology is outdated!) If you want to own every Avengers novel ever written then you will be satisfied. Otherwise, interlibrary loan the book and then purchase it if you want to afterward. I was very disappointed. MacNee and his co-writer assigned a subservient role to Emma. No humor, no banter. They should have adapted one of the TV scripts that was a delight to watch. The plot was very weak. Believe me, the Avengers movie had a far better, more absorbing plot than this book."
3,Aren't these PVC cutters?,"The photo of this product appears to be a PVC shear, used to cut PVC pipe and various types of rubber and plastic hose. Note the curved bottom jaw. They won't cut tin."
3,"Too Many Dots, Not Enough Lines","Portions of this book are fascinating. But there's a problem -- too many portions. The historical timeline is supposed to connect all these ""dots"" that cover hundreds of years and numerous social movements. As you near the 20th century, you realize too much is in this work -- people, years, personal biographies. It's a good era-related reference or outline. But tackling this book from cover-to-cover is a difficult, concentrated task -- where earlier chapters receive little allusion, and the brief historical bio's get awfully monotonous."
4,long look at the people that made history in Mexico,"It took me more than a year to finish it, but I was glad that I did. I learned a lot of Mexican history in an interesting way: by reading about the lives of the leaders, who were the ones pushing it along. Now I can return to Queretaro and understand how all those streets got their names! Curiously enough, there were two small towns mentioned in the book that I had the opportunity to visit this year, so it wasn't all dry history material. The book would be more helpful with a bibliography, or something to encourage further reading, even if the list contains books in Spanish."
4,G-R-E-A-T ! ! !,The emphasis and focus on history makes this book a MUST if one is interested to acquire knowledge of Mexican politics.
5,Deep understanding of Mexico's History,Krauze's book is insightful and full of anecdote. It will surely be the guideline to follow for years to come while dealing with the tough job of understanding a complex country.
5,Krauze is Krauze,"I read this book in both English and Spanish. Although the latter seems to be more elaborate, the former is a must to try to understand a little bit of Mexican history"
5,Good engineering book,"This is a well written, organized work on pneumatics. Thorough covers concepts, develops equations, identifies limitations and proper application. Great for engineers that need to back up their claims in a design review with calcs."
5,This is THE reference for advanced pneumatics,"This book introduces a practical approach to advanced pneumatics. The theory is enough to understand and support the design procedure and formulas, but it is not going too deep into gas flow theory as an example.Most of the topics are taken all the way from introduction to a reccomendation of what coeficient values to use in the calculation. Also I am not aware of any other book giving design procedures for control analysis like this book.This book is reprinted in 2001, and it is definitely worth the [price] for anyone designing advanced pneumatic systems.I have a copy of the reprinted version (ISBN 1-57524-164-1) , and Andersen is promising us a new version soon. In this version he will switch to the SI system and all the imperial system units will fortunately disappear!After a more basic book like, say, Pinches (ISBN 0-13-489790-0) the Andersen book is the one to continue with."
2,Not One Of The Best,"I really like Marisa, but this CD wasn't one of her better ones. I'm not really into live music unless I'm at a concert (the clapping and the audience participation distract me), and many of the songs didn't really excite me as others on other CDs have. Oh well, you can't like everything now can ya?"
2,Ciara Femme Fatal,"Was just what I orderd but the cologne smelled old,I will not wear it.The price was a little high,But will know next time!"
4,"Fun, breezy read","I'm a die-hard Amelia Peabody fan and have read the whole series. I often give the first book, Crocodile on the Sandbank, to women friends since I hate to see them miss out on the fun. This was actally my second time through this book and I enjoyed it more than the first time."
4,I love the series,"The personalities of the characters are funny and believable. This coming from a woman who has lived many years and who has met a lot of characters. Although I had read this book many years ago from the library, I bought it because its not readily available anymore."
3,last camel died at noon is a bit off the mark for this series,I enjoy the Amelia Peabody series alot. I'm reading them in order and this particular book seems VERY farfetched and out of the box for this series. I hope that Peters returns to her original style for this seies by the next book. Lost civilizations....really!
1,I truly wasted my ...on this CD,"This review concerns the unabridged audiobook of The Last Camel Died at Noon read by Susan O'Malley. I have read that book before and I am a fan of the Amelia Peadody-series which I have read completely. The books vary in quality but they are always enjoyable. The present title is one of the most unique stories - best explained as being a satirical citation of Henry Rider Haggards SHE. I also like audiobooks and last year I first heard a Peabody-novel narrated by Barbara Rosenblat. It was quite a treat. I wasn't able to get ""The last Camel.."" read by her then, but was content to order this unabridged version read by Susan O'Malley. However, it was the worst audiobook I ever listened to. ...I therefore recommend that if one ever want's to listen to an Elizabeth Peters audiobook than only if Barbara Rosenblat is the narrator. Anything else would be selfdeceit. Rosenblat even turns the weaker episodes into celebrations (all by Recordedbooks)."
2,I gave up,"After reading only 1/4-1/3 of this book, I could not endure another description of Amelia Peabody's husband. Every few paragraphs, there was a description of his hair, eyes, or muscles. With the book being a rather slow starter, I could not continue reading."
3,Worst Book in the Series,"The Last Camel Died at Noon is by far the worst book in the series. I am an avid fan of Amelia Peabody and her adventures, but this particular book drags... The only redeeming feature of this novel is that it introduces Nefret. To add to the boring story line, the pages of my book fell out of the binding while I was reading it the first time (I have never read it again...)"
2,Indiana Jones she is not,"The plot seems to be slow moving, the characters are very flat, and for whatever reason, the narrator is hard to listen to.I checked this book out of the library on a whim, the cover talking about the female version of Indiana Jones. I wasted my time slugging through four cassettes before I gave up and returned it.The plot centers around a secret map that may lead to untold riches. Along the way Peabody, with her husband and son have uninspired encounters with the local natives in egypt. The native they are traveling with is really a prince of a lost ancient civilization, the crooked porters run off with their camels and supplies. I don't know if it was just incredibly bad forecasting or just that it was so darn predictable, but I found myself wanting to fast forward just to get to the good part. Four tapes later I gave up on finding any.You might like this if you enjoy turn of the century literature, slow moving plots, and unoriginal storylines. As for me, I pass."
2,disappointed,"This book was a very disappointing purchase. The book was received promptly and in very good condition for a used book, however, the description did not mention that it was a book club edtion and without a jacket."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"If you are like me, and were looking for some original 60's hits, DO NOT buy ANY of these class reunion CD's. It says ""original artists"", but that doesn't necessarily mean the ""original hits"" as they sounded at that time. Most of these songs sounded like they were being performed by some cheesy cover bands, and I am just sorry I wasted my money and didn't read other people's reviews first."
5,This is the book dreams are made of...,"One of the ""must haves"" for any ship modelers collection. A collection of Tips & Tricks by some of the most respected ship modelers in the craft. Don't let some of it's ""expert"" tips scare you. As your skill and experience grow in the craft of ship modeling, you will refer to this book more and more often.Guaranteed you will find yourself thumbing through this fine book for hours saying ""So that's how they do that"" or ""OK, now I understand.""A book for ship modelers of every skill level, not just for ""experts"". Remember, an expert is only a person who has stopped learning."
3,Older Reference,"Not necessarily for the beginner, this worthy reference is by authors who today arelooked up to as definitive, solid, and reliable sources. However, like all things, it has become dated, and old B&W; photos leave a lot to be desired. There are also newer tools and products today."
2,"Interesting collection, but sound quality is questionable","A collection of songs, out-takes, live performances, and alternate studio takes. Some have good sound quality, but some of the performances are muddy, and some of the sound is downright terrible. Shake Your Moneymaker, Looking for Sombody, Dust my Blues, No Place to Go, Got to Move, and some others are virtually unlistenable. A great 7 minute version of Black Magic Woman sounds pretty good, as does Jumpin at Shadows, and some others. A mixed bag. But if you're a real Peter Green fan, and collect everything you can of his, as I do, there's enough here to make it worth it. Otherwise, not recommended."
3,Awesome thunder.,"I bought mine used and the amp is fried, however, I hooked a car stereo amp to it ( Lanzar Vibe 286) and this thing ROCKS!!!!"
3,Strange cut,"I've owned several pair of Jerzees fleece bottoms for years, and I really like them. The are comfy and fit well. Unfortunately, my old ones are finally getting to the point where the fuzz is wearing off and holes are appearing in embarassing places.When I went in search of new fleece bottoms, I specifically wanted Jerzees, hoping to duplicate my past experience with them. These ones are priced fairly and come in decent colors. They feel nice, too.My one complaint is that the cut is bizarre. The distance from the waist band to the crotch is too long, so you feel like you are walking around with your pants falling down. My solution has been to roll the waist band a couple of turns, which seems to do the trick, but it's a bummer from the drawstring standpoint.I guess I'll have to keep looking for fleece bottoms that fit normally."
2,too long on me :(,"I'm pretty short.. about 5'2"" I guess... and these were superrr long on me. Great comfy fit.. not too tight in the waist.. just how I like it. But it was just really long.. so I'm hoping with a few washes.. they shrink just a bit . :/"
5,Jerzees 8 0z Sweatpants,I found the quality of this product good and better than many others that I have purchased for my physically challenged son. Would recommend then to anyone wanting to buy sweatpants.
2,Disappointed!!!!!,"To start off, these are replacing an older pair of jerzees. My original pair were made in the US. these are not. Second, the new ones have an inferior and cheap elastic waistband compared to my original pair. The cut is odd also with an unusually long crotch. The search continues."
2,ovesized,"good weight to the pant but the sizeing is bad , too long and very big in the leg and backside department"
1,oversized,"good weight to the pant but the sizeing is bad , too long and very big in the leg and backside department"
5,Great Book for those of us with dogs who love to travel.,"This is a great book, we have dogs and love to travel. This book gives us a wonderful list of places to stay and other information.Thank you,Jane"
2,I was hoping for a book on where to take my dog for walks,"This book is OK but it concentrates mostly on places to stay. There is very little about places to take your dog for walks, which is what I was looking for."
3,not sure its real,"i have owned 86 pair of the 4600 over the last 15 years. i know the shoe. this purchase was for the 85th and 86th pair.the tongue is 1/3rd as thick on these compaired to the other 84 pairthe name on the heel is half as dark as the other 84 pairthe ""v"" shape on the sole side is 1/2 as dark as the other 84 pairnot sure they are the real thing. bought my last pair in december 12 and that pair matched the previous 83 pair. if reebok has changed the shoe in 2 months then they must be real if not then something is wrong with these two pair"
1,"These are not real Reeboks, not what is pictured","My husband has been wearing this style of Reebok for years and years. We have ordered them from Amazon before and got the correct shoes. However, the two pair I ordered this time were fakes. Instead of the stitched logo on the back there is a decal, also, instead of the sewn label on the tongue, there is a decal. The fit is not the same. We will not order these from Amazon again unless there is some reassurance they are the real thing. The picture is correct, the shoes, sadly, were not."
1,Just This PAIR!!!,"We have ordered this same shoe before and have been very pleased. These however, were very substandard for a Reebok shoe. The tongue on one shoe was even with the top of the shoe and the other was at least 1/2"" above. The flat part on top of the toes where they sew it together, one was much wider than the other. Don't know what happened here, but let me say this, they were no match!! Sent them back"
3,They were ok. But I sent them back.,"I sent these shoes back because they were too small.I could have got 1/2 size larger. But, I wasn't sure 1/2 size would work. Probably would have. I recently broke my ankle.It's a nice looking shoe. I'm an old timer and like the retro look. Not into outer space shoes of today.The padding wasn't that good. I've had a lot of shoes with better padding."
3,Reebok Men's BB 4600 Mid Basketball shoe,"The shoe itself is decent. I've worn this style of Reebok for many, many years. Comfortable. Unfortunately, the high top is not high enough. The ultras, which are the high tops that I used to wear, are only available in very large sizes now and I can't wear them. They were high enough. Ah well, have to find another brand now that still makes the high tops high enough for me."
3,Not QUITE what I expected...,"The ad showed a picture of the shoes with dark gray stripes, but the ones they sent were solid white; I can live with the color difference, but the shoes seemed to fit kind of tight and were hard to break in, so you may want to order a larger size in this one."
3,Pretty Cheap,I bought this for my husband to wear as work shoes as he is standing all day and he needs ankles support. The leather and manufacture seems pretty flimsy and smells really bad. And not like leather but like chemicals. The inside lining looks cheap. Too bad I bought two pairs.
3,Not true to size,I bought a man's shoe hoping it would fit my foot. It was way too narrow. A mans shoe should fit a woman's foot.
5,THANK U,THANKS FOR GETTING 2 ME SO FAST......HE LOVES IT....THANKS AGAIN HAVE A GOOD NEW YEAR FOR ALL U DID FOR ME....
1,not even close,"the mid stinks compared too the old high-top iseemed to me it was sized abit smaller. if you liked the 4600 high top you'll be disappointed in its ""replacement""2 thumbs down"
5,Great,These shoes are very hard to come by .My husband use to wear these butThe stores stop carry them so guess who has them . A very nice shoeI will buy several pair
3,Not As Good As The Original But OK,"The back of this shoe is like the original, but I was disappointed in the toe appearance which is not as round as appears in the picture. It's just not as cool as the original toe. I was also disappointed that they originally felt tight. The originals would always feel pillow comfortable from the moment you stepped into them. However, after a few days, the comfort came in. And the look is not awful. So it is still worth the price though I would probably look for the original or something else next time."
5,I love these sneakers,This is the only place i can find these sneakers.I think im gonna order 2 or 3 more pairs just encase they stop selling them.
2,A bit too much movement on the heel,I really liked the look of the shoe...but it kept rubbing on the heel when I walked around. Don't know if it is a size issue...but unfortunately headed back for a refund.
2,bait and switch,these sneakers are definitely NOT what is pictured. My husband and his best friend thought they found the perfect sneaker when I showed them this picture and I wish I had read all the posts. This is definitely a bait & switch tactic. We ordered 2 pairs thinking we got THE sneakers they wanted but what we received is a substitution. This is the 2nd time I have been let down by [...].
5,Scholarly achievement,"After having read Ms. Power's book, I am profoundly moved by her appeal to American foreign policy makers to act more swiftly in order to curtail future atrocities. Being a Canadian Jew, I have for many years not known much about other Holocausts, today, due to Samantha Power, I feel that the pain of my ancestors is shared with other peoples around the world.Thank you Ms. Power."
2,Read Kuperman instead,"Samantha Power's book should be greatly appreciated for bringing more wide spread attention to genocides throughout the world and demanding that the U.S. government should be more concerned about preventing such occurrences. Power should also be commended for her passion and idealism on the subject. Unfortunately, though, Power tends to distort the facts to fit in with her pre-conceived conclusions. For another more realistic perspective on genocides and the complexities involved in preventing them, I would recommend instead Alan J. Kuperman's book ""The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention"" -- which gives a more well-thought out and detailed analysis of the genocide in Rwanda and possible actions the United States could have taken."
2,melanie from D.C,"Samantha Power's book is interesting but, it is misleading in many aspects. It has been lot of writers failure to write about something as deep as a so called genocide topic, without having the expertise that is required to do so.One need not to be turkish or an armenian in order to comment I guess? So, let's leave historical facts to the historians, rather than publishing inefficient books such as these. In fact,her comments reflect her point of view, which provides the reader some perspective of its kind whereas this is not a novel so, it requires a well-established reference and research to write about such a strong topic.For that reason, it is only a book to learn about a different perspective, but that is all that it can contribute."
2,world view translated,speaking as a non-US citizen who studied and spent quite a bit of time there as well as other places all over the world i see this as a watered down translation for an American crowd. while not fully aware of all the events she discusses the ones i were lacked the in depth study but based itself more on easy to understand blocks for consumption and thereby skipping on certain details which were historically critical for the complete story.
1,Omission awarded?,"Despite the Israeli policy towards the Palestinians fits the definition of genocide given in the book, Power ignores the Palestinian case. I wonder if this book was awarded for its contents or its omission. It could be a good book if complete! If you want to know about genocide, read Charny , Finkelstein and others, authors with a wider vision."
5,A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide,"This is a fantastic book for anyone interested in understanding the effects that repeated genocides have had on the policy of the US. To be more specific, it is a fantastic book for anyone interested in how US inaction has contributed directly to the the repeated genocides in the last century.It is very well researched, and provides a balanced look at the horrors of genocide and the cold politics of government."
1,MISSING THE BOOK,"The problem with this book is that the author completely overlooks the culpability of the U.S. in the acts of genocide discussed. The U.S.bombing of Cambodia although not in itself an act of genocide was the reason why peasants flocked to the Khmer Rouge who previously were a marginal group. It was the U.S. who blocked any attempts of the UN to send more soldiers to Rawanda. As well, it was the U.S. that armed Indonesia so that they could attack and occupy East Timor, a clear case of Genocide. etc. etc. etc."
3,Good writing but too much history,"Ms. Powers writes an excellent book. ""A Problem From Hell"" chronicles of the worst human rights atrocities in the world since the beginning of the 20th century. On the other hand she goes into great depth on some atrocities and completely skips others; such as East Timor. The first half of the book is clearly a definitive history of genocide including Raphael Lemkin and the formations of the United Nations and the genocide convention. Then the second half dives head first into the Cambodian, Rwandan, and Yugoslavian genocides. While this book is critical of US foreign policy on international human rights, she does surmise that it may have been ""the best"" policy at the time; tragically as it was. This is an excellent book on the history of human rights protections. Her introduction lays out all of her main points and ideas very clearly so there isn't any guess work or trying to find the point. Definitely worth the read."
5,A Masterpiece,"While this book was a difficult read, is was well researched and every argument fully supported by factual data. It really makes the reader comprehend what an impossible situation the United Stated is faced with in the age of genocide and what moral responsibility the US has in preventing genocide, if any. The book starts with the foundations of the term ""genocide"" and it many interpretations and then focuses on the major genocides in recent history, discussing the role of the US and what the US could have done or should have done to prevent the genocide. The reader is also left to ponder at what cost should the US intervene in international conflicts that have little or no bearing on US interests. This book is a must read for anyone interested in genocide and what role, if any, the US should take to prevent genocide from occurring, if prevention is even possible."

1,Armenian Propoganda from Harward,"... The sections of the book that deal with the mythical Armenian genocide is totally one sided and biased, and it does not mention the fact that the Armenians rebelled against their own government and started killing Turks. What Turks did was in response to what the Armenans did to establish their own state where they were not the majority.Thank you.Yuksel Oktayyoktay@ada.net.tr"
3,"Politics from a pulpit, not from a practical point","Ms. Power and her books remind me of Charlton Heston and the NRA or Susan Sarandon and the Screen Actors Guild... Power knows she has a captive audience of people like herself and she capitalizes on their political slants with her incredible writing gift. Unfortunately, she does nothing to convince people who might vote democrat one election and republican the next...While Power criticizes the past two American presidents (W. and Big Bill), perhaps she should take a page from their political manifesto and try to understand people who live outside her pristine world. I realize she has visited war-zones... but that doesn't mean she has visted Omaha, Peoria, or Dallas... those areas contain the very voters she chastizes.Instead, Power shakes her finger on a soap box at the U.S. like the nuns which she grew up with in Ireland. By catering to like-minds, she has gone after the one thing she criticizes the most: [money]"
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT NEUTRAL & TRUE,"I studied the history of Middle East and I searched Turkey and the history of Turkey for a long time.However this book contains information which is not correct and information made up which can not be proved. Please check the population number, of that year first !!!!????One day the writer shoud visit Istanbul and also visit the Armenian people who have been living in Turkey for many years in peace ."
1,Not worth to pay a penny,"I wouldn't buy that book; as some or part of the statements in this book are not based on true facts (referring to the Ottomans, that have massacred the Armenians). For me, a writer has to be a kind of detective, that has the endless energy to search for the truth combined with the talent to put these findings into writing in an attractive way. I like the way, Ms Power puts her writings together; however not the intensity on her researches. I would expext Ms. Power as the writer to be aware of her responsibilities w.r.t. the truth of her statements before putting any word onto a ""documentary"" book. Besides, as I would like to be convinced by the facts that I wouldn't know, I could not reach out but a writer would on my behalf; and not by the clichee beliefs that under no historical platform can be proven. I assume, Ms. Power must be out of money, lately; so that she felt the necessity to publish just this book. My rating: 1 star."
2,Not Facing the Facts,"The real problem that is missed by this book, and by others of similar outlook, is that in order for the United States to act as a ""World Policeman"" would require that the U.S. Government be totalitarian in its ability to project the power and use the force needed to stop genocides. In fact to give the government such power would require at minimum a curtailment of U.S. citizen rights.There is one way, and one way only, to stop or at least minimize the possibilities of successful genocide. Simply put all people must realize that they have a God given right to defend themselves their families and fellow citizens from aggression in all its forms.Unfortunately, to teach such a viewpoint wpould be diametrically opposite to the beliefs of most authors who decry Genocide."
1,"Often in error, seldom in doubt","Power defines ""genocide"" so broadly that it includes virtually any criminal act in the world, and she argues that the U.S. has a duty to predict and intervene in any situation to which her definition applies. She wants the U.S. to become the ""Big Brother"" of the world. She does not supply any historical or philosophical evidence to support her fantastic thesis. Her recent appearance on Bill Moyer's weekly PBS program did not enhance her credibility. She is one of those persons who believes that she knows everything and expects others to accept her statements without question. On course, Moyers nevcer asked for her evidence. In my opinion, Power's philosophy is this: the U.S. should become Plato's Republic. Thanks, but no thanks."
4,"Engaging, enraging...","...for a few reasons.First of all, this is an interesting read. Power's done a great service to public policy debates by fitting a complex issue into a readable yet not overly simplified package.There's no doubt, either, that she's done a good job of writing to provoke passions. The genocides of the 20th century--and the pathetic inaction of the outside world--are well described.That said, a couple of her basic assumptions--that the US should take the lead because the UN can't, and that the world can and should trust the US to do the right thing--are not particularly well-founded or well-argued. One gets the feeling Wolfowitz et al would be quite pleased to see someone else putting forward this argument for them. Indeed, these are odd positions coming from someone who also admits that the US routinely blocked action at the UN and that its motives are not always pure."
5,Guilt By Silence and What Can Be Done About It,"Through dispassionate, investigative analysis, Samantha Powers exposes the consistently disgusting U.S. track record of indifference to genocides. Emotional rhetoric is avoided, as outrage is stirred by the facts recorded, including the lame alibis offered by Powers' interviewees (over 300). Again for emphasis, this book is not a rant, a frustrated catharic vent, but an extraordinarily well-documented, applicable introspection that identifies (and debunks) excuses and explains approaches to prevention, to punishment, and to intervention, reviewing the range of options available to the individual and to the nation. Powers quotes Sen. Paul Simon: ""'If every member ot the House and Senate had received 100 letters from people back home saying we have to do something about Rwanda, when the crisis was first developing, then I think the response would have been different.'"" This is an awareness-raising book, an equipping book, an empowering book."
5,A must read for concerned citizens,"It seems that instances of genocide are increasing as the world becomes a global community. This excellent book undertakes several case studies of genocide and asks why the world's countries, and the US in particular does not respond to prevent such acts against humanity.If you dont think this book is necessary, see the review by justreviewingit below which calls the Armenian genocide the ""Armenian Relocation""; this reviewer is an apologist for Turkish genocide. Holocaust deniers come in all forms and must be confronted with their evil. This book will help you do thatwhen you hear "" Pol Pot wasn't all that bad""."
4,"Second Helping, Please","I really enjoyed the first book, The Diary of V: The Affair. It was hilarious and left me hanging, so I just HAD to read this one. It was good, but definitely shorter and left you hanging for the third book. If you read the first one, though, you have to read the next two.You just have to root for V in these books and hope that she comes out on top. She's easy to root for...she's every woman...she makes mistakes, she has her ups and her downs, and she deals with weight issues and feeling loved. I related to her so much, and that's why I loved the series."
5,Perfect for what it is,"Squadron/Signal does not unusually make a two volume set on a war bird, so that tells you something right away - the BF-109 is an important airplane. First designed in 1933, this developed into a feared and respected opponent by all. Fast, maneuverable, small, and with tactics worked out during the Spanish Civil war, a weapon system that quickly our ranked it's competition for years to come.Each page is full of B&W; photos with new information, captions that explain not only the equipment used, but what life was like in the Luftwaffe. 10 different colors schemes are shown from 1933-1941. The Bf-10-9 heady its own against all comers until the Spitfire MIV came along. Each major development of the plane and how well in did in a particular theater is shown as well.This book covers up to the Mark 109E. It tells you why some pilots favored which version and why. That alone makes the book worthwhile, now that I have part two, I can recommend both for any collection."
4,"Good, but there is better around","Though appearantly good for a novice (excuse me fellow reviewer), I have seen in the years between my sixteenth and my fortythird better books about the Bf109, offering more text, more photographs and more information to both historian and modeller. Most of these books share the distinction that they are out-of-prints (OOPs), but both the Squadron/Signal issues will soon follow. Amongst the books which in my eyes offer more are""Bf109, Classic aircraft no. 2, their history and how to model them"" (offers a wealth of information about the early Bf109's);""Messerschmitt 0-nine gallery""(offers a wealth of information about the later Bf109's);the three books in the Monogram close-up series (Gustav 1 and 2 and Bf109K) and""The Ausburg Eagle, a documentary history"",but generally these books are bigger and therefore able to pack more information. This doesn't go up for the Monogram series, these are really much sought after!"
3,An American Pop Diary of the 20th Century,"While a nice compilation, this is clearly history for the casual student (or those gearing up for a date with Regis or a game of Trival Pursuit). The book is nostalgic not scholarly. While thought provoking in places it clearly presents the 20th Century in typical American style... by sound bite and snap shot. The volume is long on highlights, celebrity and sensational events and short on analysis or cultural milestones in music, art, exploration, literature, and science. This book certainly fills a niche (coffee table, middle schooler strugging to get a handle on mom and dad's past, etc.) but Jennings would do well to leave history to the historians. Readable, entertaining, but don't pack it to college."
2,The Century in America is a more appropriate title,"Dear Mr. Jennings: Hard to believe that as a former foreign correspondent and citizen of the world you've taken such a glib view of the world outside the US. The coverage of your book is so disproportionate, and so personality-driven that it's almost like the People Magazine version of history. What happened in Asia (Sino-Japanese War, democratic revolution in the Philippines, India/Pakistan) were given minimal coverage. Do you think that more than half of the world's people matter this little? Perhaps you should call this The Century - volume 1."
3,Am I nitpicking??,"Received this very attractive book as a Christmas gift and am reading through it on a daily basis. While reading the chapter on the 1920's concerning the general topic of Religion I was taken back by the words on page 123 at the beginning of paragraph #4...""Like the Klan meeting, the evangelical gathering provided an outlet..."". do I read into this a typical bias/smear against religion or was it just careless editing/writing?Will I find in this book other paragraphs beginning with ""Like the Klan meeting, the typical modern day environmentalist gathering..."" or ""Like the Nuremburg Rallies of the 1930's, your modern day gathering of the National Organization of Women...my guess is definitely not.Sorry authors but your choice of phrasing on this one seems quite imperfect...one person's opinion."
3,Gandhi and Indian struggle for independence aren't mentioned,"I'm a twelve year old 7th grade student. My parents are immigrants from India though I was born in Germany. Mr Jennings, in your book I would like to point out that Mahatma Gandhi and Indian struggle for independence were not mentioned at all. Gandhi was a very important person in the history of this century, he led a revolution to success without any bloodshed. I don't mean to criticize your book, but Mao Zedong was mentioned a lot in your book and in my opinion I think Gandhi was a more important figure than Mao Zedong. Yet, your book had a vivid description on World War II. I'm interested in the history of the war and know a lot about it. You gave a great vivid summary of the Battle of Stalingrad. You had a really touching story about the collapse of communism in Europe."
2,Dust in the eyes,"PETER JENNINGS conveniently forgot to mention the first GENOCIDE of the 20th century, the Armenian genocide of 1915,where 1and a half million innocent Armenians were massacred at the hands of the ottoman turks. Interestingly, the Holocaust was not left out."
1,Bias?,"The book contains some good stuff, but it forgets to mention one thing -- the genocide of the Armenians in 1915 by the Turkish government when 1.5 to 2 million Armenians were tortured and killed. I wonder what Jennings was thinking. Maybe he got some favors from the Turkish government which until now refuses to recognise what it did."
3,why was this part left out?,"I was really surprised to discover that Peter Jennings did NOT say anything about the Deaf President Now movement at Gallaudet University in 1988. He reported on this event on ABC News but did not include this at all! For Deaf people, this was their Civil Rights movement.The Deaf President Now movement occurred because they wanted a Deaf person to become President of the only liberal arts college for deaf students in the USA. African American colleges have had African American presidents and women colleges have had women presidents. It was about time that Gallaudet University got a Deaf President. It also meant that deaf people wanted equal access to communication and for a week, they got the world's attention. There is a book called ""The Week the World Heard Gallaudet"" by Gannon.I would like to know why this information about civil rights movement from the deaf perspective was omitted."
3,Another Clone,"Rather bleak, rather common. Come on, how many more clones of these books do we need?!"
2,Jennings neglects Titanic movie and Armenians,"In his book that presumes to review the past century, Jennings neglects to cover three important things that happened this century - the sinking of the Titanic, the release of the Titanic movie, and the Armenian genocide or something. For this reason, I must strongly denounce the book and its author and call on all decent Armenians, Love Boat passengers and all those who watched ""The Titanic"" to boycott the sale of this utterly wreckless pillorying or something of the last hundred years."
1,21st Century bunk,Only Jennings would print a book a year too yearly. What if something major happens before the 21st century starts next year? Do some research (like he didn't).
1,How can a man of such historical ignorance write history?,"This is the gentleman,who at the end of the broadcast on the British leaving Hong Cong, stated that only 200 years ago the British were ramming opium down the throats of the Chinese. Unless laughing at the how the ignorant can influence millions amuses you, save your time and read the equally ignorant outpourings of your daily newspaper. (Yes Virginia, opium was legal in this country less than two hundred years ago and doctors thought it was a miracle drug.) It is understandable that Mr. Jennings needed assistance in writing this book."
2,Coffee Table Books For Dummies,"Isn't it funny that a book allegedly written by ""Journalists"" and ""Reporters"" can be so poorly fact-checked as this one is? First off, Jennings purports that the 20th Century ends at December 31, 1999. It doesn't. It ends December 31, 2000, so says the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the United States Naval Observatory.Besides that, as others have pointed out in these reviews, way too many people have been left out of ""The Century"" - as if their contributions to history do not matter nor exist.It's a nice-looking coffee table book, but those who buy it should not think for a second that it is anything more than a glossy and large (if narrow) view of the past 98 1/2 years. There are many better history books out there if that's what you're after."
4,Not Bad,"A fair job on content, a great job on photography. This isn't the definitive work on the century, but it has its strong points. I bet Paul Johnson liked the pictures."
4,The Century,This is good reference book. It is the type of book that you cannot read in a few weeks. It is the type of book that documents the events in the 20th century. It is a good history book. Bravo!!
4,"An excellent story, but it cannot have everything.","The narratives and text of The Century are astounding. As the authors suggest, this book is truly meant to be read through as a novel. However, its title is very ambitious, and its material focuses more on America and its growing historical stance than taking on an objective point of view for the entire world. Still, this text will remain a great documentary on the shaping of American history."
3,Interesting...But Missing Alot,"I bought this book for my husband for Xmas. I spent several nites reading it, when I should have been wrapping it. The premise is great, the eyewitness accounts fascinating but they left out SO MUCH. Like what, you ask? The Titanic, Bruno Hauptmann, any mention of the Lindeburgh kidnapping, The Hindenburg, Amelia Airheart... to name a few. You can probably find more things, depending on your own interests. I realize they couldn't include EVERYTHING (it was a long 100 years) but to give OJ a page and a half, same for Princess Diana and not mention some of the above? Not a bad book, but could have been a GREAT one."
2,A view of the century for Americans by Americans,"I really expected a more international flavour from a transplanted Canadian like Peter Jennings. The authors almost forget that there are people outside the United States that shaped peoples lives and defined the century. A more appropriate title would have been ""The Century as Seen by Uncle Sam"""
3,This Book is Like Reading the USA Today newspaper,"I was somewhat disappointed because I was expecting more in depth coverage of historical events. The book left me looking for more, thus reminding me of the USA Today analogy.Like the paper, it gives you brief stories of historical events."
3,A good summary of an outline of 20th Century History.,"An excellent summary of some of the major events of the 20th Century. Omits far too much detail to be thought of as a serious work of history. Often skips the ""why"" of important events. The text suffers from an inability to separate conclusions from the context of the times (a little too judgemental). In a disapproving tone, Mr Jennings points out that German victims of allied bombing never received compensation. Why would the world compensate people who worked so hard to support the Nazi regime that produced Auschwitz and Buchenwald? Dresden deserved no better."
2,Future historians will find it worthless.,"If this book was intended to be a summary of news stories, embellished by anecdotal information, then the authors' objectives have been met.If, however, the authors were hoping to memorialize events which, at the end of the next century, left an imprint on our nation and the world, then they missed the boat.The impact of surging human populations, and the complications resulting from migration, have been the story of our century. But it never became the story for Jennings' The Century. Future historians in the next 100 years will look back on demographics and migration as having a profound impact on our culture, civilization, freedoms and body of laws.Migration was mentioned for the 1920s. Thereafter, the issue vanished from the book. But it has not vanished for the rest of us.It is lamentable that a 606 page work on The Century would overlook these factors."
1,yada yada yada,"The question isn't what the book leaves out. Armenians, Italians, the Titanic -- OK, but what do you want from one book, fat as it is? My beef is that it's so predictable. Nothing surprising, nothing daring, nothing unconventional, nothing I couldn't have gotten from Life magazine, but the whole thing is shot through with this smug sense of ""Has ABC News got a Century for you!"" Clearly what they really wanted were blockbuster bestseller and an anointed ""intellectual"" anchor."
1,If Jennings were re-writing history it would be much shorter,"HOW COULD A MAN OF JENNINGS CALIBER WRITE A BOOK ENTITLED ""THE CENTURY"" AND FORGET TO INCLUDE THE SINKING IF THE TITANIC? THERE ARE ABOUT TWO OR THREE OTHER BOOKS ON THE MARKET WHICH COVER THE 20TH CENTURY. MY ADVICE IS TO GO AND FIND THEM AND BUY ANY OF THOSE AND NOT THIS ONE."
4,Enjoyable reading with great personal accounts,"I was pleased with the ease at which one can read this book. Unlike the majority of history books, this book keeps the reader's attention and provides interesting personal accounts by people who experienced these monumental events and periods of history. It is much easier to identify with a person who is telling you about their life and how history shaped their activities than to read a narrative account of ""the way it was.."" I think the average reader as well as history buffs alike will enjoy this book."
4,The Cheat is Not Dead,"This is too much, man. StrongBad is a multifaceted performer--metal, pop, and more.The man behind the mask has a tender side, too. ""You've got an ugly (...) and you're stupid"" will surely go down in love song history as a classic lyric.I have to give props to ""The Cheat is Not Dead;"" a true standout.RUN, don't walk, to Amazon.com to purchase this disk."
2,big and baggy,"Simon Schama is a brilliant man. He knows Rembrandt, Holland, Rubens and many topics backwards and forwards. But he has no dramatic sense. He has no gift for compression. And his prose vacillates between insiteful and flatulent. So reading this book becomes a very long and tiresome chore. I'm no expert on Rembrandt, but I have read better analysis of the paintings in other books. Overall, a tiresome and uninspiring effort."
2,Doesn't have a focus and objective....very boring,"When i bought this book, I thought that it would be an amazing and definitive book about one of the most brilliant genius of art.But i was wrong, this is doesn't have a point, it goes to the biography of Rubens fathers, passing thru history, economy, and anything else you imagine, this is so borring for the people that actually want to know about Rembrandt and his work. So if you are looking for a book abou Rembrand and his work, this IS NOT...."
2,Disappointing,"I too am disappointed in this book. It's all over the place with other destinations, format is terrible. Lots of info on nothing relevent. Pictures are good but not relevent! No information on current ports! No information on shore excursions, all info is short and vague. This book was slapped together from many sources and is not for people who are actually planning on a panama canal cruise."
2,"Covered with old library markings and Missing ""Large Color Map""",Purchased this book for a cruise I was taking. Mildly disappointed that the book was marking Library property all over including the card pocket. But very unhappy that the Large Color map of the area was missing (this was the main reason I choose this book).
3,"Good for rock and pop, not much else...","...very robust boom-boomness though not quite as good as having a quality subwoofer, but if you're mainly looking for a party speaker this is not a bad choice. There's a reason Cerwin Vegas are so popular at fraternities and sororities!However, look elsewhere if you want something with more finesse and clarity in the midrange and natural not shrill treble---especially lovers of jazz, classical, or vocal-dominated music."
4,"Great for the price, but...","I could give it 5 stars for the graph itself, but I could give it 0 for the universal Transom/Trollmotor transducer. It hangs down low under the trolling motor housing in harms way. (Go to Garmin's website and download the owner's manual to view how the transducer mounts to the motor).I broke it first time out. I fabricated a mounting bracket from aluminum plate. So far so good. This product should be available with a puck style transducer just for mounting to trolling motor."
5,Garmin Fishfinder 140,"I purchased the Garmin Fishfinder 140 about a month ago and have used it on 3 different fishing trips. It has performed up to my high expectations! The set up was relatively quick and simple with some DIY experience. The menu and programming options are very simple and breezed through them without even consulting the owner's manual. Overall, I'm impressed with the unit and the options it comes with. I was looking at a few different Humminbird fishfinders, but since this one was consistently rated higher, and many people reviewed it so well, even though it was cheaper priced than Humminbird, I took a calculated risk. It paid off in spades. Garmin has made a good name for themselves (I have 2 other Garmin products that I've had for several years and have never had a problem with them) and this product is and should be no exception. Now, I'm goin' fishin'! lol"
4,"So Far, So Good","I bought the fishfinder mainly for the depth finder feature while fishing/crabbing in the rivers of the Chesapeake Bay region. It was very easy to install on my jon boat and to hook up to a small 12v battery I purchased from Cabela's. So far, it has worked as expected. I have been adjusting the settings for my own purposes and I like the alarm when I get into too shallow of water. Have not had too many chances to see how accurate the fish finder is under various fishing conditions, but it picks up fish and displays both big and little fish icons on the screen. If you are looking for a quality fish finder at a low price, this unit is a good buy."
5,Garmin Fishfinder 140,"I really like this fish finder. The guy that complained about the 1 1/8"" inch hole? I've had an Eagle and a Humminbird and both had to have that size hole? For the price it's a nice fishfinder. Go to your local boating store and buy a nice chrome cover to go over the hole you had to drill, I put clear silicone all in the hole then placed the chrome cover on the back of my boat, looks great! Quit whinning."
1,Not worth the money,I've had this product for 3 months and it stopped working 3 weeks ago. It simply will not turn on and prior to it not working anymore it has problems with freezing and not scanning. If you move from shallow to deep water you have to reset the unit for it to start reading the bottom correctly. Sometimes it will stop reading all together and you have to reset the unit. It takes about 30 seconds between resets for it to start reading the bottom correctly. The plug that goes into the back of the unit doesn't always seat in correctly. So sometimes it takes several attempts to seat it before all of the pins make contact.The only good thing is that it did come with a trolling motor mount.
4,NOT a GPS! Good fishfinder,"This is a very good fishfinder and depth indicator. But despite the name....IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GPS!This is just a fishfinder.Edit Dec 2008I see they changed the title of this unit.It now correctly describes what it does.Makes my ""review"" look a little silly!"
2,Buyer / Installer Beware!,"I bought this unit, not knowing that the canon plug from the transducer to the back of the unit requires that a 1 1/8"" hole be drilled through the transome of the boat for the install. Other units require a hole considerably smaller [1/2 - 5/8""]. The unit has 6 wires in a 22 pin plug.If it was not for time rquirements I would have sent it back.Garmin if you are going to continue along this idea, include a wire cover big enough to cover the massive hole!Then Garmin elected to ignore my complaint.Good Job Garmin."
5,Garmin fishfinder 140,I purchased this at the start of fishing season it has worked very well easy to use I would reccomend this unit for anyone who loves fishing
3,It is OK,"I think for the money is OK. Installation was pretty easy, transducer was a littledifficult it attach. Only problem so far is all the alarms works but when one sitsback in the chair to operate the boat, cannot hear the alarms. I emailed Garmin peopleabout the problem, they said they were glad to have me as a customer but ""there isno way to correct the volume of the alarms. I would recommend the fishfinder.The item was sold and shipped by Amazon, was two days before it was shipped andstayed in Atlanta for six days, so much for the free shipping."
5,great product,I bought this depth finder not wanting to have to take a class on how to use one.Works well in auto.The unit was easy to mount and is very easy to remove when you park your boat.I like it so much I just ordered a 2nd one for the front of my boat.This unit also comes with the dual mount system for trolling motor or transom.Amazon has the best price and as usual the best service.I reccomend this.A good easy to use product without the pricey bells and whistles that are rarely used.Thanks Roy
4,"Works and looks great, connector to big.","With no experience with fish finders I cannot get very technical, but unit seems to function as described. Display is big enough to view and back light is nice. The only issue is the connector. I did read about a ""large"" connector in other reviews, but it is about an 1-1/2""- 2"" in diameter, much bigger than I would have ever guessed. If you are transom mounting this unit it would take a VERY large hole to neatly route the cable, and the instructions tell you that warranty is voided if cable is cut. In the end I routed the cable over the top, it looks OK I guess. Just beware of this issue, other than that nice purchase for the money."
2,Needs a size chart so you can order the right size,"I ended up googling these type of panty hose so i could try and find a size chart in order to make sure i got the right size and didn't just guess. I'm almost 5-7 and 135 and I got size 1-2. Ya, that was too small and i ended up ripping them trying to shretch them up higher so the crotch wasn't midway down my thighs. I mean, they aren't a bad quality for the price and i probably would have liked them if I had gotten the right size.... just make sure you get the right size!"
2,Berkshire French Cut pantyhose,"I did not want panty hose with control top. The item does not state it has control top. I returned it the first time as it was the wrong size. It was replaced with control top panty hose and when I called the company I was told they do not make hose that is not control top. Strange, as the first batch did not have control top. The fit was very odd. The hose top had what appeared to be more of a thong than a French cut panty and the thong part was not in the correct place. I returned two of the three pair."
3,"Archaic, but complete","The Loeb edition of Ammianus is superior to its Penguin compatriot only in that the entire text is present, albeit in 3 volumes. However, the translation in this edition is from the mid-1920s. It is full of outdated terminology and a rather tough read. Translations don't have to age badly, for example, look at William Whiston's translation of Josephus. However, this translations has aged badly, and you'll want to keep your Latin dictionary close so you can check out what certain terms mean in the Latin text, as the English is likely to be more confusing than anything. Ammianus is well informed on military matters, but translating Roman military terms into 19th and 20th century British military terms does not work.If you want to read Ammianus, there is no perfect road for you. The Penguin edition is incomplete, and the Loeb is ancient, and rather pricey.3 stars for Loeb not updating the translation."
4,Exactly what I needed,"I ordered this because I had a telescopic lens for my Minolta Maxxum, and this works perfectly. My telescope screws in great. It even has a lock ring which that allows you to center the lens as you need."
2,4th Gerneration Xerox,"While the text is useful, the 'photos' of the manuscripts allow you to do little aside from determining the shape of the page. The resolution is so poor that manuscripts look like dirty pieces of screen wire copied on a Xerox. The cover photo is the only clear image. The photos appear to have been converted to B&W line art without removing the texture of the paryri."
4,"Infuriating story, needed copy editing","My biggest quibble is that Weiss refused to use semicolons between independent clauses. That's not an option; that's a grammatical requirement. There were other grammatical slips throughout.That aside, he has done an invaluable public service by thoroughly investigating something the Peace Corps, both of today and of the 1970s, wanted the whole world to forget: when a sex-starved, psychotic volunteer killed another volunteer in 1976 in Tonga, the Corps hushed it up, subverted local justice, and failed to make arrangements to incarcerate the murderer -- freeing him to a long, accomplished career back in his hometown. The book draws infuriating portraits of the incompetent and misguided Peace Corps officials who essentially killed Deborah Gardner a second time by rallying around her murderer. Be most suspicious of the most self-righteous agencies. They have the most to hide."
3,A Murder in the PC and also of the English language,"The grammatical errors and flip flop narration style of the book were extremely distracting to me. (I've never seen as many run-on sentences in one place.)As I was a PC volunteer in Tonga, the story was very interesting and so made the book worthwhile. I wish the author had listened to his English teacher if indeed he went to class."
3,Where was the Editor?,"Where was the editor of this book? A compelling story marred by truly bad writing. It would have also benefited from an index and perhaps a dramatis personae. I had a terrible time remembering who was who -- not only is there a large cast of ""characters"" but the autthor at times introduced new people only by description and nickname, attaching a name paragraphs or pages later.Some may say that the poor writing is really just the author's individual ""style"" but they'd be wrong. Bad writing is bad writing. Period."
2,interesting story badly told,"the author obviously did extensive research into this true story of murder in Tonga in 1976, but he appeared to have felt compelled to include every detail anyone ever told him, including hundreds of details that are completely and totally irrelevant to the story. it is difficult to imagine that this book had an editor of any skill. the author's ""style"" was extremely annoying, and i finished the book wishing that a better journalist had undertaken this effort."
1,Dreadful hack job of writing.,"Poor writing & a pointless, meandering narration that's overly focused on the author himself, make this a book to AVOID."
5,Have the Talk he Needs!,"TALKS, when used by a father or someone in position of a father can use this book as a ""jumping off"" point to engage a young man in issues he'll be faced with in life. The quotes and questions highlight this book as Dr. Davis wades through difficult areas that we avoid but lend itself to thought provoking and revealing discussions. This is a much needed tool in a culture that has thrown its hands up to a generation of young men ill-equipped to deal with who they are because of fatherlessness and its effects. Used extensively in mentoring programs within the NFL."
3,Fair to midling,"Joanna Trollope strikes me as just a little too self-important and condescending. At the end of this book my main impression was, ""So what?"" I don't sense the empathy and compassion for humankind that is the mark of Anthony Trollope's books. In ""A Passionate Man,"" the wife, Liza, is left, basically, without her dignity by story's end. The hero of our story, Archie, turns out to be not quite the perfect specimen we'd believe him to be at the beginning, but he's still not, in my view, compelling.And why is Ms. Trollope so seemingly hostile toward the Church? If she's going to trade on her ancestor's name, she ought to show a little more ... hmmmm, if not respect, at least courtesy, to the institution Mr. Trollope portrayed with such clear-sighted affection."
5,western pleasure training and showing to win,This is a good book for people who want to train for show and for those who want to have a well trained horse. It explains in terms that novice horse people can understand and appreciate and still covers the finer points of training. The book keeps your interest and is easy reading.
2,not your average penthouse video...,"this video was not what i expected...it's not like most of the penthouse videos, it's actually a cable version of a porn movie, so there is alot less close up shots of the sweet spots, so stick with the playoff and pet of the year vids"
4,Great housecleaning assistant,"I've never had a Roomba. I'm too cheap. I bought this one instead. I like it. I'll clean a room, clear the floor, then set it loose to do its job while moving on to the next room. It works, but occasionally misses spots. Of course, by the time I return, the room looks so much cleaner I'm actually motivated to take out the standard vacuum to finish up."
3,"Fair, but no roomba","I've had this for a little while (in between roombas) and it does a decent job on tile, but don't expect too much from rugs. We have two rugs that I have to pick up because if it gets on them and runs into a wall, it can't backup to turn around. Lately, although it is showing it is fully charged, 3 out of 4 times, it will run for about 10 seconds, quit and show the battery is drained. It runs slower and quieter than a roomba and doesn't bump into things as strong as a roomba. The dust bin is easier to see, but it doesn't hold as much as the roomba. Dueling robotic cleaners is a riot though when it does work."
3,Worked great until it died forever,"I cannot find a replacement battery for this vacuum, which I absolutely loved. Went to Batteries Plus--they only have Roomba vacuum batteries. So it was great while it lasted--picked up TONS of dog hair, dust , & dirt, really made my life easier. It IS noisy so I usually let it run while I was out & came home to clean floors. So I'm shopping for a new robot vacuum & will have to get a Roomba because of the battery situation. It just won't hold a charge anymore."
1,Dead after 3 months,"The machine worked fine. Was great on cat hair. I would run it once every other weekend in our bedrooms to get under the beds and get the cat hair. Did not do so well with anything else but I had intended it only to handle the dust, dander, and cat hair. The silly thing died last month and will not hold a charge. After being fully charged it will run for a few minutes and then the low battery light comes on. Have cleaned it out but to no avail. What a waste of money."
1,You get what you pay for,"Infinuvo QQ-1 CleanMate 365-Intelligent Robotic Vacuum Cleaner, RedI bought the CleanMate rather than the Roombas I've always purchased primarily because of the cost. I found the suction to be not as good as the Roomba but adequate. Also the battery pack and filters were hard for me to open as I have arthritis. But the worst problem is that it quite working after just three uses. I suspect it is the battery. I have tried numerous times to contact the company to no avail. Very frustrating! So, if you want to gamble with a vacuum that won't break down, go for it. But if you think you will need to return or exchange it for any reason, forget this product."
4,Good Helper,"My ""little red"" (my name for it) is a great helper. We are still learning each other but I do think it will help make my housekeeping easier."
4,Glad I purchased!,"Everyone in my house hates to vacuum so our floors (vinyl & berber carpet) would go weeks without cleaning. Finally, we decided to get a robotic vacuum and after doing a bit of research, decided on this one. We have it clean 1 room at a time and it does a great job. The dustbin is easy to clean, though it's a pain to brush off the air filter each time and it does need to be recharged after it's cleaned 2 rooms but otherwise, I have no complaints. We have a thick rug in our hallway and the robot has no trouble getting that clean either, just be sure to stay away from plush rugs! We don't have pets but we do track in a lot of pine needles and this guy gets them all. Now we don't stress about getting the big upright vacuum out every 4-6 weeks because our carpets look great!"
3,More dependable than Roomba,"I started with Roombas but they all broke down after a few weeks of use. When new, Roombas do a good job and that is the reason for the good reviews. However, once you are out of the Roomba warranty, they not only provide no repair service but wont sell you replacement parts. I junked my last Roomba because a simple plastic part wore out, something Roomba engineers should have know would happen based on how it is used.Clean-Mate is not as clever as Roomba and has weaker suction but it does not fail as fast as Roomba. It is not great, but until somebody comes up with a dependable robotic vacuum cleaner, it is adequate for those who want the robot experience."
3,Entertaining more than cleaning,Well it does trundle around happily and manages to get around just about everything in the room and into the corners. As far as cleaning goes it's a bit of a let down - place 5 pieces of dust and dirt in front of it and let it trundle over them - 4 remain. But if you let it run for long enough it'll probably start to get a carpet clean. It's somewhat better on a hard surface.
5,What an incredible story ... what an incredible man!!,"Having just returned from a visit to the Longaberger Basket facilities ... a surprise from my sister (in-law) ... I was in awe and immediately had to order this book and read how this all came to be ... it is incredible!!! Dave Longaberger overcame so many obstacles, it was amazing, and the 'empire' he built is almost unbelievable!!! Now that I have read the book I must go back to Ohio and enjoy my time there even more."
1,Not A Very Helpful Book!,"As stated by another reviewer, this is a book for ""Longaberger fans"" (pretty much a waste of time and money for anybody else). The wholesome, made-in America image that the Longaberger family is trying to convey seems ironic to me now, since the company is outsourcing a large amount of their products in China. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except the die-hard Longaberger enthusiast!"
1,"Poorly Written, Poorly Edited","This book is awful, poorly written and poorly edited. There are numerous typographical errors in the text, and the writing is riddled with cliches and obvious advice like ""Work hard"" and ""Be friendly"". Gee, I would never have figured that out!This is one of those books that would never have been published if the author weren't rich. Save your money, and buy a different ""inspiring story"" book instead, this one is not worth your time."
1,Same Old Stuff,"This book is basically a rehash of the last Longaberger book. A few new things here and there, but nothing to hold your interest. I'm sure his cult like following will enjoy the book, but for others who don't have an interest in the baskets and pottery, this book will do nothing for you. Pass on it and read something else."
3,Too repetitive,"I enjoyed the book and wish I had been able to meet 'Popeye'. I did think that the same principles were repeated over and over again in the book. ""Care about your people"" was said 1000 times it seemed. The same stories were used in multiple chapters. It could be cut down, put into an inexpensive paperback, which would have been worth the money."
3,"emma,wow shes all grown up!","when i saw this cd cover i was so shocked to see that emma whoused to be aka:baby spice has gotten so old [no affense emma]well i guess thats life! so anyway about the single,it hasfour songs.They will really remind you of the 90's and likethat really old band called the beach boys."
2,How did I manage to get through this?,"I began this novel because a friend sent it to me when we were studying Primo Levi together. What begins as a fascinating premise deteriorates into tedium within a hundred pages. Would that he had stopped there! I agree with the reviewers who describe the characters as uninvolving, worse, self-pitying and boring, even the great writers who are invoked. Primo Levi, Jean Amery and the other golems would be embarrassed by the quality of the writing. I can't believe Elie Wiesel would approve, either. I am note tempted to read the author's other books, sorry to say."
4,Rings true not only for decendents of Survivors....,"It occurred to me while reading this excellent book that there are many families whose current generation need to face and address the family past. While my dad's family was in crisis/turmoil for some time before, there are many parallels between the aftermath of my grandfather's Navy service in the Pacific in WWII (including Guadalcanal & Tarawa) and the type of aftermath this family has. NOTE: they are NOT identical, just somewhat similar in the effects for the next generations, especially when things are not spoken of but hang in the air & take on a life of their own.The only reason I knocked off a star is for a rather mundanely contrived ending, but it really doesn't effect the essence of the book. A great work!"
2,Disappointing and Dismal Writing,"Although the premise of the story is a good one, the way it is handled literarily fell very short of expectations. I kept wondering whether his editor was on vacation for allowing the contant ranting and philosophical tangents, leaving absent the ""showing"" that might have been more appropriate to a novel. The story had interesting ideas to explore regarding holocaust victims and their children, but doesn't bring any light to the ideas, just a overblown ghost story which doesn't deal with the concept of ""golem"" at all and instead virtually slanders a generation of disturbed writers, despite the apology at the outset of the novel. I finished it only because I had assigned it for my book group and was embarassed to have done so. Steer clear."
2,"Ok, but spout doesn't work very well","It works ok, but think mine came with a damaged drinking spout. I have been unable to make it work without covering a significant portion of the spout, which isn't convenient when running."
4,Good backpack,"Does what the description says, insulation really keeps liquids cold or hot (but i never had hot fluids in it). The only thing is that the sleeve that is ""insulated"" doesn't really keep the fluid in the tube cold; I would take a swig, and get hot water then cold water would flow when it came from the backpack.Feels very durable, keeps fluids cold, and light weight. I wish it came with a small pocket somewhere, but not really a flaw."
5,touching and mesmerizing..,"I was so moved by this book..every woman's story was more gripping than the next, and I felt I was getting a rare inside look at addiction from a female point of view. Betty Ford has made a difference to thousands of people, and it's about time that the world learns more about this powerful woman and the lives she's touched. I'd recommend this to anyone--not just those who have struggled with addiction."
5,Harlem Sunset is a page turner,"I picked up this mystery by first time writer, Kris Kumar. After thr second page, I was hooked and read it non-stop for 5 hours. It has been a long time since a novel has kept me so engrossed. Excellent piece of work. And what an ending!"
4,Dry but interesting reading,Not easy reading but a very useful self development tool.This book aims to get the reader to remodel bad personal habits.
1,Too much babble for the amount of content,"After years of hearing people rave about the Seven Habits and watching ""Covey"" become a leading brand in management and leadership training, I finally got around to reading the book that started it all. It would be fantastic if it was about 20 pages long. As it is you have to wade through far too many ""success stories,"" and other self-help flavored fluff to get to the actual content."
1,More Secrets for the Clueless,"This is another sort of New Age revealed secrets kind of book: I skimmed it and it is super silly and predictable -- secrets that are first learned must be learned wrong in order to understand them fully (how long has that idea been around, I ask? -- worse it pretends to be a novel when it is only a tract to make you a Dewey follower. Now portions are free on the net and too costly at that!"
2,You're Scaring Me People,"It's a little scary to think that some people don't seem to realize that this is a novel. It is imaginative in places, and wordy and trite almost continually. As novels go, not so good, and that's the scary part. With all the glowing reviews, either they're planted or some people must want to believe this is a true account. Doesn't anyone out there see the reasons to doubt the veracity of the author? I guess I could say a few more things, but it seems like piling-on. This is certainly a curious mixture of new-age and fundamentalist Christianity, but for real,..... please. (for more details, see comments)"
1,Spammer Writes Book,"It's really not a bad book, but I wish the author hadn't spammed me in order to get me here. It is nice to see a small press and an unknown author produce good work, but there are other and better ways to promote literature. Mr. Dewey should continue his fine work, but he should also refrain from sending unsolicited e-mails."
4,"""Immortal"" Delivers","Mr. Dewey has brought us all both an excellent read, as well as an entertaining, story form approach to answering the many spiritual questions being asked today. In both style and content, I have given ""The Immortal"" 4 stars. Although I could have felt comfortable giving it 5 stars, I thought I'd save that fifth star for J.J.'s next installment. I feel confident that readers of this material will be amply impressed, and that most will not delay in ordering the complete version."
5,Answers for sincere seekers of TRUTH,"This is the one of the most thrilling pieces I have ever read, because it confirms what Jesus said, that there would be some that would not taste of death as written in the Bible, in Matthew. This book will make you look inward and at yourself in an entirely different way. If you believe in miricles, you will believe this one. He has made the first 21 chapters free to read on the web, by just doing a search on the title. This little free-view absolutely made me thirst for more! I had MANY inner questions answered and confirmed. As a whole, it makes for great reading and spurs you into looking forward to MORE of what the author will have to offer."
5,"Good Book, Mysterious Author.","I read the book with enthusiasm and excitement. Afterwards, I wanted to find out more about the author. I knew he was former mormon, but I didn't know much about him at all. He is such a readable author, I wanted to know more before I went on to the rest of his books. After I read about the Prophet Onias, I admit, I had my doubts as to where he gets all his ideas. Nonetheless, Dewey has left it to me to decide what is true and what is not. Somehow take comfort in that statement. Whether he is brainwashing us all or not, that is another story, hehe. Good read for almost anyone though."
4,Get Results with this fun and inspiring HOW TO DO IT Book!,"This is truly a 'real life' scenario, that is inspiring in its simplicity with clear, concise principles of life. When these principles are tested through application in your own life, you will discover RESULTS do indeed occur.Having read the first book, the combined Book 1 & 2 were gladly received as a gift, that causes one to take another look for the wisdom on every page. I recommend this book as a splendid gift for anyone, at any time of their life, since to inspire people to want to gain more in their lives and with others is the greatest gift we can give."
4,The Face of Trespass by Ruth Rendell,"This is what I expect from this author - it keeps you turning page after page to get to the ""crunch line"". I recomend it for all readers who enjoy this genre - forensics."
3,"If you can stick with it, it pays off","This book gets going very, very slowly, as if it were a twentieth-century imitation of Crime and Punishment (which it in some ways resembles). I would have abandoned it long short of the ending if I hadn't already read enough Rendells to expect it to pay off in the end. And it does pay off, though I'm still not sure I would have begun to read it had I known how long it would take to hook me. The protagonist's long brooding is a good fifty pages too long for my tastes; this is a short novel that would have worked just as well, if not better, as a short story. I was about to say, ""I don't care what happens to the main character, let alone about anyone else in this story,"" when the impending twist finally popped up. So if you've started this one, hang in there; the good part does finally arrive. If you haven't started this one, read Judgement in Stone instead."
4,An interesting inside view of what occurred during the early days of theosophy,"I appreciated this book by Sinnett, one of the early pioneers of Theosophy. It fills in the missing pieces with regard to what happened after H P Blavatsky left America. I found Sinnett's perspective regarding the attacks in India against Blavasky, enhanced my understanding of theosophy and its development.This book was easy and enjoyable to read. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to research the history of Theosophy. The only negative I found with the book, was I thought it was a little pricey."
2,Not even worth borriwing,"The two stars are for the nice illustrations and the attempt to tackle a difficult topic in a children's book-homelessness. The story, however, is slow and aimless. It never really goes anywhere. My children think that Trupp is cute, but find the story to boring. In today's market, publishers would be very unlikely to take up this book. There are hundreds of children's books out there that are far better."
2,trupp,I found this book to be really weird. I didn't really like it very much. The book is about a animal that travels to where human live. He finds out that the world is big and colorful.I would suggest this book only if your bored. So don't read it!Mark C
2,It's not what you think it is.,"This book is over priced for what it is. If you are going to buy bolt on parts that have instructions, then you don't need this book. This is just a very basic bolt on upgrade book. You realy don't need it, unless you know very little about working on cars. You will be better off buying the shop manul."
2,Don't buy!,Horrible I thoght it would be the haynes guide on another level instead its like reaing a tuner magazine it only shows what others have done to there Focus' and not how you can mod yours in a step by step fashion. Really terrible please don't waist your time.
5,Sooo funny!!,"What an amazing book!! I was laughing out loud when I read it!My son, who's two, sat througth the whole reading! He loves the illustrations!! Bill Peet is so amazing. He has such an amazing way of breathing life into his characters."
3,A Better Mind Then Mine,"A few things grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and made themselves evident to me when I read this novel. Firstly, Norman Mailer is a much smarter man than I, secondly, Norman Mailer can write very well when he wants to, and thirdly, he can do a lot better than this.Set in a boarding house with a serious of muddled characters and little to drive the narrative outside of dialogue, the book fails to reach the heights that were probably imagined for it in it's conception. It is my second experience with Mailer, the first being The Fight, which I rate very highly. This novel, despite it's best efforts, have failed to seal my opinion of Mailer. Maybe I should read The Naked and The Dead and be done with it. In short, I think there are better books out there to be read."
5,Very Useful,"I purchased this tool set because I needed something small to tighten the screws in my sunglasses and eyeglasses. They do the job and I have found other uses for them too. I installed a new PCI card in my computer, these were just the right size."
3,There are better representations of bach out there,"The music is good. Don't get me wrong, it is Bach after all. It's just that the instruments and the recording aren't the best I've heard. I don't hear that stratovarian sound. It's not bad.. it's just not the best."
5,A powerful and hope filled endong to a great series,I'm no practiced reviewer but just want to say good job to Mr. Salvatore. I enjoyed this series immensely. This is your typical happy ending fantasy novel but written very well and a very easy read.
3,Black and White Fantasy,"What makes "" The Crimson Shadow"" trilogy second rate compared to""The Reluctant King"" trilogy of L. Sprague de Camp? The heroes never lose, when they are finished ,they want more ""adventure"". The bad are are really bad and never learn, the good guys are paragons of virtue.I call it Black and White Fantasy for that reason.The plot is kind of a miss match of fantasy elements or historical periods:nothing in the novel fits anything that was ever very likely to happen, ever? Pretty much you have to ignore all human history and normal behavior to like this kind of writing.So I have to say that when you start one of these novels, you prettymuch know who is going to win,and who is going to get cut into little pieces."
2,"Oh well, we're hopelessly outnumbered but.. hey, we won!","That, in a nutshell, summarizes most of this book. They fight, they get outnumbered, they fight back, things look grim, then WHAM! Something happens and they win. Again, and again, and again.I can't say too much that is positive about this one. It was far too rushed. Someone else said it correctly when he/she stated that it could have been ""a trilogy unto itself"" or something like that. Had it been about twice as long covering the same amount of ground, the pacing would have been just about right."
5,An exciting and intriguing trilogy... To say the least!!!,"I picked up the Crimson Shadow trilogy last month and are just about to finish The Dragon King... (30 pages left). I just have to say WOW! The entire trilogy made me feel as if I was a participant. The characters are vivid and beleiveable. Far removed from Drizzt, (Not downing Drizzt at all, I love the character), Luthien is just an ordinary person and does not win battles because his skill with a sword is so incredible. He wins battles because he fights with heart and spirit. All three books were compelling, filled with exciting battles and a tumult of emotions. I can honestly say Salvatore is my favorite author of fantasy. He easily pulls you into his world. I'll keep reading as long as he keeps writing!!!"
2,"A rushed so connect the dots story, dissapointing.","This book is not terrible but is a far cry from Salvatore's best. The plot is obvious and inevitable. It seemed like something I wrote for English 101, pulling an all nighter. There was a sense that he rushed to finish the story and he just connected the dots. I'm just glad I bought the paper back. I've read every one of his books and I find that his new books cost more and offer less."
3,not as full as...,although nothing bad can be said of the Vega's they certainly do not deliver the complete sound that I believed they had for the price. If your want the name buy away!:)
4,It ISN'T Hogue,"The grip isn't as ""grippy"" as Hogue grips. It does help with grip in that your fingers have a defined place so your grip stays as unchanged as possible when shooting. I'm not a great shot so this grip seems to help my shooting by helping my hands remember where to grip the gun."
4,great add on,I was very pleased with this easy to add on grip. It did take a minimal bit of trimming but it turned out great.
3,Nice add-on ....,....if i wanted to use my old grips. I ordered these by mistake and thought they were Hogue grips. I was disappointed but If I had a nice set of grips and wanted to add the wrap around finger grooves I can now use this. Adds like a 1mm on each side of the grips when installed.
2,Good book for 210 & 215,I liked this book for the 210 & 216 but it was severely lacking in the 216 & 217 tests. You will not pass unless you have a TON of experience. Its a good book to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Not 4 birds. Get different books for 216 & 217. I was NOT impressed with the CD rom either. Its asked hard questions NOT coverd by the material.
4,Just okay... but it worked for me...,"I agree, as few can argue, that Carter's NT 4.0 text was the text to use. The 2000 study system, I believed, was lacking specific detail on a few topics. To supplement (or I should say in conjunction with) the text I borrowed a non-production server from work and tried nearly every new feature of the Win2000 OS. I took the 70-240 exam and passed. I also purchased the complete BFQ software 70-240--good buy. I used no other study material. Perhaps Carter too assumes that the reader has experience with NT 4.0. Either way, the book served its purpose.Yes there is repetition--it's called reinforcement. The intro chapters are great, always stating that more detail is to be found in a later chapter. The highlights of what has changed from NT4 to W2K are also a benefit.Not as good as his NT4, but worth while for exam study. Once you pass, get something else for reference and more detail. Remember this is an MCSE study system-not complete coverage of Windows 2000."
4,Great book!,"I have been using using this book and I already passed exams 210 and 215. Though you will need the MS Resource Kit to pass the exams, this book helps."
5,"Best ""Getting Started"" MCSE Training Book EVER !!!","I have been reading this book and completely feel that this is the very best way to learn what's nessesary to pass MCSE certification. This book takes the approach of teaching you the material (as opposed to helping you slide past an exam). This book will help you pass the exam and prepare you for real-world hands on situations that you'll face in the workforce, putting your MCSE to work for you.Read this book first and no doubt you'll be much more prepared to take on individual study books for each exam. This book is the most direct course to successful MCSE study."
2,Good book for General knowledge not MCSE Exam,"This book has too much of expnation for not very specific reasonIt does not seperated the professional version and Server version Its very hard to mix NT and professional and Advance Server and Saerver in any giving chapter I wish he could seperate the material for each Exam through individual chapter for specific Exam or else take MCSE tittle off , and if you want to take for example 70-215 exam you have to look ot many chapters and read lots of none related explanation and practices, Bunch of Windows NT Ideas make an exam taker more confused, I find it boring none sense and too much waste of time If you want to take MCSE exam ."
3,Mixed Review,"Leigh's work can go either way for me. This one was more miss than hit, but . . .The heroine was OK, and her daughter was cute enough. There was a large cast of supporting characters, most of whom I assume have had their own book. And I thought the ending was a little rushed.But the hero was a moody SOB, so self-absorbed that most of the time, he could not hold a conversation. He was forever storming off, ""Never mention this again!"" Maggie's daughter might be a toddler now, but IMO, involving herself with Daniel is preparation for when J.D. hits adolescence.However - SPOILER ALERT - in the last 20% of the book, the heroine finally forces a conversation and both the hero and their relationship grew enough to be interesting.If you are already a fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy this. If you are new to Leigh, I suggest you try A Weaver Baby or the duology Mother In a Moment / Millionaire's Instant Baby for a better first."
4,Colorful and Lively and Fun...,"Looking with the other reviews written, I do see their sense of frustration in wanting more practical ways to decorate a home, however I felt it needed to be seen in a postive light as well. It is a very artful book, and I don't believe the author intended it to be a ""How To"" as much as it was intended to be lively, inspiring, ""get-you-to-think"" type of book. It has beautifully tipped-in pages, and is a very high quality book. I am a graphic artist, and I bought it for the book's design as I did for its content. If you would like a wonderful coffee-table type book, as well as some inspiration for decorating, you should enjoy this book!"
2,It all depends on how you want to look at this book.,"I can very well understand the last reviewer's comments. It is an artsy book and doesn't give much helpful advice when looking for answers to decorating issues. I chose to use it to help me coordinate a color palette that would work and not clash. With the artistic approach the author took with this book, I found myself utilizing my own imagination about what the colors evoke for me, the mood, the accessories that would create that mood. So, in its own way, I guess I did get a little help. As it's an expensive book, it's better to leaf through it for inspiration, as you won't get alot of solid 'how-to' and 'do it this way' advice, if that's what you're looking to find."
5,Captain Smith and Pocohontas,"For those fans of Anthony Dexter this movies is not quite as exciting as ""Valentino"" but is one that you will thoroughly enjoy. It is obviously a low budget production but watching Anthony Dexter on the screen is stirring to say the least {even after all these years} Also, Jody Lawrence is excellent as Pocohontas. This is a thumbs up all the way."
2,Good for a laugh,"A friend from work got this for me because it was in the $3 bin. We both know the real history and she knew I would get a good laugh out of this, and I did. I laughed just reading the front cover and the description on the back. Granted, concessions must be made for the time period in which this movie was made, but it is still not anywhere near accurate to what really happened.Now I am someone who loves and knows the real history and loves movies so I can separate the two since they are two entirely different things and always will be, but this movie really was laughable. I enjoyed it for the comedy value, though I imagine that was not the intent. I have a feeling if not for the comedic value gained through my knowledge of the real history, which is vastly different than this movie, the movie probably would have had very little interest for me. As it is I would only recommend it if you know the real history and want a good laugh."
1,Disappointed,I wish I had not purchased this one. It is poor quality and very unexciting. Not a good choice for me.
4,Thieves of Lankhmar,"This supplement uses 1st Edition D&D; rules but with a little creativity can be used as a launching point for any fantasy campaign.More a sourcebook than an actual adventure,this product gives detailed information concerning the history and operations of Lankhmar's Thieves' Guild. The information presented within these pages would be useful to any DM seeking to create a smiliar organization within his or her own campaign setting.Several adventure seeds are included as well as a short scenario near the end of the book. The maps of the guild house are quite good.The details regarding the guild's day-to-day operations and politics, retirement and relative rank within the guild are excellent.This book would be an asset to any DM running a rogue-dominated campaign."
3,It is OK,The product had been my longing since I came to have the knowledge of it some three years ago. And I am happy it was delievered as promised in the Amazon adverticement. Thanks for the job well done
1,NOT EVEN FOR TRUE FANS!,"the remixes are gawd awful. was hoping for some sort of dance remixes which have heard in clubs. however, the songs on this cd sound as if someone was just tinkering with some electronic equipment and decided that could be called ""remixes"". this is NOT worth purchasing - trust me. and I am a B I G both diana ross and the supremes fan."
2,Mt. Rushmore tie tack,"Very disappointed, tie tack is very small compared to picture that is shown . Expected it to be larger the price was a little steep but it was purchased for my teenage son who loves eagles. would not order from this company again"
4,Beautiful Pin/Tie Tack,This pin/tie tack looks exactly like the picture shown. It is 10K gold with black edging for definition. The eagle is stunning. The pin/tie tack is approximately the size of a dime. Excellent for those looking for that subtle elegant touch for their lapel or tie.
3,Mixed Feelings At Best,"I have to admit to having mixed feelings about this book even though I am a big fan of Lysa Mateu. If you have been watching Lysa and reading her on-line diary then you will not need this book. This book is virtually only entries from her on-line diary, which I read long ago, combined with some stories from her first book tour. The stories about her psychic talents are great but there are few stories about that in the book. The book really is a self help book where Lysa constantly tries to convince the reader that everyone is great, wonderful, has a good soul, can do whatever they want... I've read this stuff in so many books and when you compare it to real life you know it's not true. There is good and evil in the world and not everyone is beautiful and wonderful. Unfortunately, I got bored halfway through the book but forced myself to finish so I can only give the book three stars."
2,No Breakthroughs Here,"Although the book is aesthetically impressive, it left me wishing the same amount of attention had been spent on it's content. I found little new information that wasn't culled from her previous books--""Poison Pen..."", ""Conversations with the Spirit World, or her online diaries. (which have been removed). I expected the book to have the chronological flow of a diary, but, though there were some amazing stories, I found they were difficult to follow.As for the self-help advice. Too much ""Do"" and not enough realistic ""How to"".I feel Lysa could have provided much more depth and insight than could be absorbed and utilized in a ""couldn't put down"", ""read in 24 hours"", quick fix book."
5,Read it in one day! Re-read it the next day!,"I didn't get the opportunity to read this book until the week after it was released, however, I didn't put it down once I started reading it! It was very powerful, moving, motivating, and above all captivating! This book rocked and it's more than a good read, it's very inspirational."
5,I feel totally inspired by this book,"I am over 60 pages into ""Psychic Diaries"" I love it, I love Lysa's insight!I just lost my Father one month ago today and am feeling an unbelievable, overwhelming, need to communicate with him. Every psychic I have gone to has told me I have the gift....I have had dreams that have come true and am very intuitive.Just by reading a few chapters of this book I feel a desire to ""be"" more...I feel totally inspired. At 30 I feel like I can.Thank you for being you Lysa!"
5,Fan in Singapore,"I am writing all the way from Singapore. I loved ""Psychic Diaries"".I've read and re-read it a couple of times, and everytime I do, it keeps my spirits up!I enjoyed reading about how Lysa went gone through so many phases in her life to find her life purpose.There was this part in the book where she said that ""the Universe gave her the boot"". She wrote about how she did her first channeling sessions, and how she felt everything was too easy, so she had to find a job at Paramount, but she lost it shortly afterwards when she told Nancy, the regular assistant, that she was channeling the vice-president's deceased father.That got me thinking for a while about leaving my current job! And I finally did! And I'm happy now!I look forward to getting a copy of ""Conversations with the Spirit World"", which is rather hard to find in Singapore."
5,All my questions - answered,"Dear Lysa,I bought this book the week before last and have been reading it nonstop for the past week. On Wednesday, my beloved dog died and I've been heartbroken beyond belief. Tonight I picked up this book again and realized that this wasn't just another ""psychic book."" This book is to explain WHY, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN and HOW. It's kind of strange how I just picked up this book as I was browsing the section and a week later - tragedy struck. I am getting the answers to all of my questions and a little piece of mind."
5,THIS BOOK GAVE ME HOPE AGAIN,"I was given Psychic Diaries after the passing of my husband 2 months ago. I could not put the book down. I felt it enpowered me and gave me hope in my new journey without my husband.Thank you, Lysa, for sharing your experiences & psychic powers I will be reading Conversations with the Spiritual World next."
5,The best book I've ever read,"I bought Psychic Diaries on a whim, and couldn't put it down! It is filled with true stories about people who have crossed over and how they came through in detail for the people they ""left behind."" I am re-reading the book now and reccomend it to anyone who wants to live an amazing life. Lysa's writing is fast, intense, and wonderful. Reading this book is the best thing I've done for myself."
5,woke me out of my stupor,"I just finished reading Psychic Diaries. The things Lysa writes about love and living were among the most inspirational I've ever read. Her words rang so true to me.Sometimes these things you already know unconsciously, but you need them put into language so you can recognize and act on them. So I'm writing to say thank you so much, Lysa, for waking me up from my daily stupor and giving me the nudge I needed to pursue how I want to live."
4,"Straightforward, accessible, but maybe too much background","Although this book has a little bad grammar and spelling (Harper Collins must not have good editors anymore), and the biographical parts are a little too lengthy it is still worth reading.Lysa Mateu is very straightforward and does not mince words at all. That alone holds your attention, but I really think the biographical areas are not as interesting or as necessary as she seems to think. But it is good to see the story of a psychic's life where the psychic was not foretelling someone's future by the time she was 5. Lysa seems to be such a regular person, a person who sort of became this thing later in life. It gives hope to the rest of us that we might too find out there is much, much more to be being human than we think."
3,"Great photos, average prose","I should say that this review is more of a request for the author to improve the book, which would make it outstanding. In its current state, it is merely acceptable.The photos are great and the coverage of different countries and styles excellent. However, the descriptions are oftentimes boring listing of dates, there are very few anecdotes if any, and the disucussion of different castles is incoherent and inconsistent. Almost every page has a description of a castle without a corresponding picture. Not all castles have a plan. The plans themselves do not follow a consistent style throughout the book. There is no sense of unity or progression in the book. You could practically jump into any page and not miss any of the discussion.In general, this is recommended as a coffee table book or for browsing the photos. If you are looking for an actual history of castles and fortification, then you will be disappointed."
1,The History of Castles,"I ordered this book with high expectations. Alas, it was a waste of money. The author, I'm sure, knows a lot about castles. However, he is not at all articulate in communicating his knowledge and he has as much logical organisation as a dozen monkeys sitting at typewriters and gibbering away at random. At times, technical terms are introduced without definition, and without appearing in the very limited glossary at the back of the book. Not even the images can make an investment in this book worthwhile -- if arranged and annotated more helpfully, they could have been instructive but as matters stand they are about as much help, and have about as much aesthetic appeal, as holiday snaps found in an abandoned album."
1,no loop for the lens strap,"had i known this lens cap did NOT come with a loop so that i can attach it to the lens strap, i would NOT have bought it... its hard to imagine a lens cap you you have to put into your pocket each time you use the camera... it'll be lost in a week...anyway...a waste of $3.49 plus $6.95 shipping..."
5,Wonderful Toy,"After multiple children, the toy is still as cute as it was when originally purchased and ready to be passed on to our 11month old daughter. It has been thrown against walls, taken down stairs, running with a toddler, yet still works and has never had to be fixed. What can i say, its tons of fun and works great. Plus it survived this long.That is exactly why we started buying only wood toys for our children--> plastic ones break to easily and its hard to fix them. Wood toys can easily be fixed and can be handed down generations to come. Plus they are hand made and parents can admire the craftsmanship."
4,Great baby toy,My grandaughter loves this toy but there was a problem with the length of the pull rope. The rope was very long and as she played with it her parents noticed that the rope did go around her neck. The rope was shortened no problem. I would recomend this toy but with instructions to shorten the rope.
4,tale of two victims,"THE FIRST CUT is an early work from Peter Robinson sans Alan Banks. It is a psychological thriller that alternates the narrative between two surviving victims of ""the Student Slasher"", a serial killer who brutalizes female university students in a grisly manner. This is tightly woven, suspenseful story of revenge told in tandem from two perspectives until they merge for a satisfying climax."
2,no psychological thriller,"After reading the online reviews of this book, I was all set for a psychological thriller, but it was anything but. It wasn't hard to figure out the ending about halfway through the book. I have read other Peter Robinson books that were much better."
1,First Cut,"I did not receive The First Cut be Peter Robinson!!! I got another book called First Cut by a woman author. I have forgotten because I gave it away. I have already written about this, perhaps you will reply this time! Thank you Luann Robertson"
1,Waste of Money,Math Advantage Doesn't work with Windows XP. Pagefile errors prevent program from working. Encore Software support website fixes do not work.
4,Wow! What a read!,"This is one of those books that you will pick up and not put down until you've read the last word. It is a book about manipulations and secrets and all around evil. Camilla, the main character, is greedy and self-centered. Her only concern is what she wants. Will she get what she wants? How many people will pay? It's worth the reading to find out! Enjoy!"
1,Not Very Impressed,"The vent visors did not fit on my 2001 Jeep Cherokee Larado, when I was told that they would. When I tried to return the product I got the run around. They kept telling me they would call me back after they checked into things. Needless to say NO ONE ever called back, after I called atleast 10 times."
2,"Average BBs, horrible shipping","Fine, average BBs, absolutely awful shipping. I ordered a book a day three days after the BBs and it came 6 days before. I also ordered a pistol and it came in two days, whereas the BBs came in 12 days. 12 days for 2000 average BBs. Absolutely awful, will never buy again. You shouldn't buy either. I wish when I was going to buy this there was a review as informative as this. Just to state it again: horrible shipping, average BBs, don't buy."
5,For Kids Tired of being Patronized!,"My 13yr. son and I both read this book. He immediately took it to school and gave it to his health teacher (who coaches football and teaches health and antidrug leactures), and his English teachers so she could consider it as the next book for the class to read. He warned her it had strong language, but like Catcher in the Rye, it startles kids by reading words they may not be able to speak at school but they hear on the bus everyday. The story is facepaced and bittersweet, it makes a completely non sports person appreciate a rare and gifted talent and appreciate how vulnerable it is."
1,Don't buy!,"I bought these covers last year and they cracked and split right away. Even as I was taking them off my chairs to throw them away, they tore into shreds. And I live in California--very mild weather. Save yourself some $$ and don't buy this product."
1,Poor Quality Item,This cover does not last more than a few months outdoors. I bought this item twice and both times fabric fell apart even though the second time I used covers during the summer only (I live in the Northeast).
1,Quite Possibly the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"While I have seen some bad movies in my day, this has to rank in the top three worst movies I have ever seen. The special effects are beyond cheezey and I have to wonder if the writer and director were trying to be kitschy or if they actually expected anyone to take this seriously. Run, don't walk, run from this film. I wish I could give it zero stars."
4,"Cheezy yes ... but yet classic independent ""B"" movie","I can't agree more and less - it is a simplistic, cheaply made, independent film from the film capital of the world - Canada. But that is what makes it great. I remember seeing this as a child and realizing immediately how silly yet captivating it was. It was pure, honest, wholesome and silly - perfectly innocent even naive. Even if you are not interested in buying it, I encourage you the read the synopsis @ http://www.kiddiematinee.com/c-xmartian.html"
5,An Absolute Must Have,"Just read the names of the folks in this dvd. That alone got me this dvd. I don't know about everyone else, but my image of Louis Armstrong has been an older man, sort of laid back. I've heard alot of his recordings from his earlier years, but never had much of image to fix to him in his younger years. He's still the allmighty ""Satchmo"", full of youth and going wild. His stance while playing is like he's telling the world... ""Yes.... indeed I am the allmighty Satchmo"". The dude is awsome.And Cab Callaway.... the boy goes wild with his hair flying and singing. I've never seen him in any films, except the Blues Brothers. Again it's good to see him as well as ""Satchmo"" in their youthful wild and rowdy days.I could go on and on. Again just look at the names featured on this dvd. It just don't get no better. Do yourself a favor and get this dvd."
3,Okay,These don't stay up very well but if you are using them just for 'play' they work out just fine.
3,Nothing beyond a story,"Perhaps this book begun as a story for the Washington Post and it should have stayed there. It is a very easy read but does not delve into the actual work and daily battles of the ""chosen five."" I was surprised by the gossipy tone and focus on the minutia. It seemed that Leibovich could not penetrate through the PR watchdogs during his interviews. Thus, he chose to focus on the wardrobe, the surroundings, and the mannerisms. The book was entertaining but I kept waiting for deeper insight...it never came."
4,Best Kids Fun software,My son starts to use this software and it is very easy to use for him. He love playing with this. Really great and cool program for kids.
1,Kid 4 AWFUL,"Amazon should be ashamed for allowing their good name to be besmearched by this mess. UNBELIEVABLLY AWFUL/AWFUL/AWFUL (notice the all caps). Broderbund WOULDN'T even support their own product. The people that was supposed to support it said that I needed to stop all other programs from running. Then to top that, the software loaded some sort of program on my computer that I had to end up taking my computer to a technician to get the program off. DO NOT!! DO NOT!! DO NOT!! buy this mess!!!!!!!"
1,Don't buy this if you have a mac,"I bought this because it is finally OS X native. Installed KPD4 in my account, but when my daughter opens KPD4 in her account, it will not save, no permission. Broderbund will not support, they redirect to encoreusa. Encoreusa has no support on their site for this product. Not covered in their knowledgebase, or forums. And they will not support by phone. No reponse to e-mails except form letters with no followup. There are permissions problems generated by this product, and they are unresolved.Just don't buy KPD4 until it is supported."
2,Upgraded from version 3 and Disgusted,"All my kids (ages 3-10) LOVED Kid Pix 3 so when I lost it in a computer mishap I was excited that there was a newer version. The newer versions are SUPPOSED to be better, AREN'T THEY??? Well, imagine my disgust when I installed and ran it for the first time and this little 6 inch square pops up surrounded by inches and inches of blacked out wasted screen. Version 3 filled the entire screen and everything was sized much larger and therefore easier on the eye and more exciting to work with. I did all the techie stuff. This is just version 4...a tiny little area with tiny little icons that nobody wants to play with now. I'm giving this away."
5,One of Two Top Software My Daughter Loves,"Right along with the Giggles software this is the highest ranking software for my 3-year-old daughter. As Giggles taught her mouse movement and clicks, Kid Pix Delux has given her a new freedom of interactivity. While she can drag and drop amazing backgrounds, she loves to create lines and circles as they stretch and make goofy sounds. I set this program to automatically start when she turns on her computer. For some reason she loves to exit out of Kid Pix Delux first, go to Giggles (search Amazon for this product,) giggle at the cutest giggles when this program starts, and then comes right back to Kid Pix Delux to do her art work. The CD I bought is for Windows."
5,Works on Mac with this VERSION 2,"I have an Intel Mac running 10.5, and this software works fine. I think the reviews stating it doesn't work on a Mac were referringto the version 4, not this one, Version 4.1."
3,Trouble sharing KidPix,"KidPix works great on my administrator account, but won't run on the other three accounts (including the kids') on our home Mac. Help files have not helped! Still looking for a solution."
3,Didn't load,The install software did not work on my new computer but did loadwithout problems on an older computer.The software is very interesting and can be used for school projectsand general entertainment.
5,Great Learning Tool!,My daughter is in kindergarten and she uses the kid pix in computer apps class and she really enjoys using it at home. It keeps her busy and it's a lot better than her watching the t.v.
1,Hate it and i always will,Kid Pix. Bad program for painting.I have dreaded this program since elementary school (we didn't have any games so we were forced to do this if we had free time.) Luckily I'm in middle scool now and we have games that are good. Anyway the programThe badOn the computer we couldn't erase with bombs or else the computer would crashthe painting is terrible
5,Kid Pix Deluxe 4 worked fine for me.,I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.7 on a 1.25 GHZ G4 iMac with 1 GB of RAM. I just installed and ran the Encore version of Kid Pix Deluxe 4 (v. 4.0.0.148) with no problem. I was able to save and print in the normal way.
2,"BLAH! After 6 months of headaches, I am placing it under my car's rear tires","This is just not for Mac users. It *works*, but it continually crashes under both Tiger and Leopard, Intel and PPC.I really do not have a lot of pros to add because it has been nothing but frustration, to needing to set user names that don't always work to having to insert the game disc every time you play (which is a pain if you have multiple computers and children who are prone to lose, break things, play frisbee...).It is a good cheap time occupier if it works - and would be good for hand/eye coordination, plus fueling creative juices. However unless you want to work on frustration behaviors, skip this if you have a Mac."
1,BAD,"Lousy product--won't install, NO online support. Downgraded to Kid Pix Deluxe 3 by MacKiev-easy install, plays nicely."
5,My Girls love it,"This is a simple art program where they can create art with special affects for their age. They use the same software at school, K & 1st. My girls love it."
2,disappointed,"Less is very much more with this product. Knowing how many hours of fun my older children had with the original version, it is with great disappointment to see the cluttered and fussy improved version. Hardly being used. My old laptop still gets dragged outto use the original though."
1,wont work at all,"Was looking forward to upgrade from K3 to K4 but the program won't install properly and can't be accessed. To make things worse, I can't uninstall it either as it keeps giving me an error on the uninstall. In addition, I can't reinstall Kpix 3. This was one of my son's favorite programs and am trying to find a substitute that won't be beholden to the error that seems to be infecting both programs."
5,Learning Company Kid Pix Deluxe 4,These is a great software !Fun and educational my entire familyplays with it.It is fun for all ages.And it is a great deal.
5,Kidpix is great!,Kidpix is fun to do for kids and adults alike. Its great to incorporate into your lessons in the classroom. Kidpix allows kids to learn and have fun at the same time!
5,Kid Pix at home,"After using the Kid Pix programs for years at school, my 7 year old son asked for it for Christmas. So far this one has held up to his expectations. He loves not only creating detailed pictures, but then blowing them up, as well! His 10 year old brother enjoys it just as much!"
1,Don't bother for Macintosh,"I bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it. I have a Mac Pro running the latest version of Mac OS. I installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution, which is kind of silly in this day-and-age, but that works OK. What does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes. Pretty unworkable. Don't bother buying this for a Mac."
1,zero stars for Mac users - purchase Kid Pix 3 by MacKiev,"Mac users - Purchase Kid Pix 3 (which is nothing like the original Kid Pix 3 that came out years ago) from MacKiev dot com. Their version is elegant and beautiful!The Riverdeep version of Kid Pix 4 is nasty and freezes constantly. I am a lower school computer teacher. The Learning Company/Riverdeep/Broderbund has failed me time and time again by not updating and supporting their products for evolving OS changes.***Once you get the product (either MacKiev or Riverdeep version), you have to enable flash in your Quicktime preferences in order to get the stickers and animations to work."
2,Poor performance on Macintosh,"I work as a tech in a school district with a Windows/Mac environment. Since we have gotten KPD4, we have had nothing but problems. It has constantly frozen or buttons have not worked on both operating systems from day one. There was a patch that fixed the missing button functionality for both sides. However, still on the macs to this day-- they still freeze. I have called tech support, they just keep referring me to their support site, which I had already read through with no improvement. There will be up to 35 kids at a time, from kindergarten-3rd using this so you can imagine how frustrating it is to have the kids work creating something- only to have it freeze on the eraser causing me to force quit the application and lose their work.I definitely would not recommend this edition."
1,Incompatible with Quicktime 7 on Mac OSX,"According to Learning Company, Kid Pix Deluxe 4 in incompatible with Quicktime 7 on Mac OSX. The Rubber Stamp functions do not work. Not recommended for Tiger or Leopard."
4,"Older version, still fun","I bought this older version. The girls use the newer version in their computer class at school. They have had a lot of fun with this version, and they still haven't figured out all they can do with it. For the price, this is a great 'game' to have on our computer at home."
4,My kids love it,"To program looks interesting. I have not tried it myself, but my kids use it in school and are happy that they also have it at home."
1,"If there was a Zero Star setting, it would have received it!","If you liked version 3, you better keep it. The screen resolution problem with version 4 is flat out in-excusable since the earlier v3 did not share the same issue. This should be a simple programming 101 line of code. Shame on Broderbund for not at least keeping the basic interface, the 'exit' door is gone, the first thing my grandkids did was look for the old familiar GUI, its gone! Now only a ridiculously small play area and a pathetic menu bar at the top that only confuses them. A word of advise to you application guys, if you are going to 'update' or 'improve' something, make sure you are not destroying the very thing that made the product such a success early on, add the features but leave the stuff that worked alone! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!"
1,Installation issues,Program came with a bug and would not install properly (DirectX .cab problem). Will have to return it. Very disappointing to my 6 year old and irratating to me. Uses an old version of Quicktime and asks you to uninstall your newer version in order to install the old version. Too bad b/c my daughter really likes using it at school.
4,I absolutely love this model,"I personally already own the same model of this flute. It's got wonderful tone, and a clear crisp sound. I would recommend this model to anyone looking for a good professional flute to have. A very nice flute."
1,I Always Thoght KA Was A Good Brand......,"But I was wrong ... I used the item 3 times and the bowl started scraping and cracking. I also bought a Mixer that came DOA.So I went and replaced my Hamilton Beach Big Mouth . My prior one lasted 4 years , under heavy use and the new Hamilton Beach Big Mouth is even better. I gave this KA to a friend who had no food processor at all. I will never buy a KA product again."
4,Experience the 1960s ...,"... with a fine female vocalist. This collection includes some of Petula's own hits plus her interpretations of classic songs from that decade. The immortal Downtown, Don't Sleep In The Subway and This Is My Song fall into the first category. Her elegant covers of We Can Work It Out, Groovy Kind Of Love, Let It Be Me and Games People Play have that 60s magic and are great to hear in a female vocal. Every track is enjoyable with her appealing voice and the lush instrumentation. The title ""The Essential"" is probably a bit misleading as there are plenty of compilations available with a broader spectrum of her own hits, which were many. Nevertheless, this album is a wonderful way to relive those golden years."
4,Lots of fun!,"This game is lots of fun. If you are a fan of the MechWarrior seriers, this one will not disappoint. The missions are challenging and interesting, and the story line isn't too bad either."
2,"Works, but not well","This tripod features a quick release and easy flip from portrait shooting to landscape shooting, however, when in landscape mode the tri-pod mounting surface never goes flat, so all your pictures come out crooked with no way to adjust it. I had to put my camera on facing the crooked mount making it point either slightly up or down. Very compact, but doesn't take straight pictures in landscape."
1,Bait & switch again!,"Thought I ordered a QT-100, but they substituted a junk tripod. Same as two other reviewers posted. Only person making out is the shipping company.Ritz camera stores will not accept unit, must be mailed back (per my customer service person in India)"
3,Disappointing - not enough Placido Domingo,"In this hour and ten minute 1990 VHS , you get eight songs by Placido Domingo (Ay, Jalisco, No Te Rajes; Cocula; Noche Plateada; Serenata Tapatia; Las Mananitas; La Negra Noche; La Rose Fria del Calvario; Janitzio), all just fine and well-recorded. The problems are with the English narration and voiceover, as the producers have picked an English speaker who seems unable to pronounce either English or Spanish well, and with the 13 non-Domingo tracks, some of which are badly recorded - noticeably scratchy and wavery. On the other hand, where else are you going to see Placido Domingo, dressed as a simple fisherman, singing Agustin Lara's 'Janitzio' with Lake Patzcuaro as a backdrop?"
2,"Impressive research, but tedious to read","The doctor's plot would make an interesting 30 page chapter in a larger book on Stalin's life, but there's just not enough material of interest for it to sustain a 300+ page book. There is quite a bit of repetition and tedious exploration of obscure documents and characters. The author demonstrates that the book is well researched, but in this case that does not translate into a well crafted story."
