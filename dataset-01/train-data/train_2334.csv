2,Too Sensitive,"Although the reviews were mixed, I was really, really hoping this was going to work for me since I live in an apartment and I am the only tenant with a dog. My dog's barking is driving me crazy and I'm sure it's annoying my neighbors as well. Anyway, the Lentek arrived today and I plugged it in immediately. The noise emitted did cause my dog to stop barking BUT the device is so sensitive that the noise was being sent out whether my dog was barking or not. I know this because I initially had it set on ""audible"" to make sure it would be activated when my dog barked. (It was set on ""low"" sensitivity.) I don't see how this could be effective if the alarm is going off non-stop even when my dog is not barking... how is that going to train him not to bark? I'll be returning this ASAP."
1,"Didn't ""hear"" barking","Perhaps I got a bad unit, but barking (from my dog or, um, me when testing the unit) never actually set it off. And, yep, I had it on ""audible"" so that I could hear when it went off. I spent about 10 minutes barking into the microphone at point-blank range and the only thing I heard were the hushed tones of my neighbors debating my sanity..."
1,What can I say?,This seems to have no effect on the barking dog next door. I have it on the fence pointing into there yard. Seems to do nothing to stop the noise.
1,Do Not Waste your money!,"The first time it went off my dog stopped barking then the stupid device keeped going off at any noise my kids opening and shutting cabinet doors in kitchen, opening and shutting the front door, it would go off just from them droping something my dog is nothing but confused and stressed. We unpluged the dumb thing and it sits in a closet!"
2,Poor Business!,"I ordered this product on the 21st of june, and the company didnt even ship off until the 20th of july! to make it even better, they refuse to ship to me at an APO address, so i need to have it shipped elsewhere, if it wasnt taking long enough! if i had known i would have been waiting so long, i wouldnt have purchased this product. even if it works well for me, i still wont recommend it to people. Horrible!"
1,Doesn't work,This device would not even pick up the loudest barks from as little as 3 feet away. The only time it actually worked (produced a sound) was when you tapped the unit directly over the microphone. I returned it immediately.
1,Item faulty,"Unfortunately the item didn't work, so I don't know if it was good or not, as I am in New Zealand, I can't be bothered with sending it all the way back, it cost approx $35 to have it shipped here"
4,Worked Great,"I bought this because my neighbor complained my dog would bark a bit too much for too long at the postman or the UPS guy. I placed it by the front door. And it worked immediately. Dog learned to just growl softly when the UPS guy knocked, low enough i guess that it didn't trigger the beep. I would highly recommend you give this a try. I am using it indoors. The cord is plenty long to reach just about anywhere. and it is a small enough that I can hide it behind something to be inconspicuous, or tuck in a drawer when I don't need it out."
1,Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,Well I thought after reading the reviews that I would give this product a try. Well I tried and it failed. The dogs have not slowed down the barking. I would not recommend this product. Very disappointed.
2,doesn't work as expected,"I bought this thinking that it would only go off when the dog barks. Well this thing goes off all the time for no reason, it doesn't matter how you set the sensitivity. I tried every configuration and this thing still goes off from even if a fly buzzes by. I would not recommend this. Get a hand held one you can control when it goes off, the one by PET AGREE works great."
3,Kept me from maiming the neighbors dogs.,"This does not stop them from barking. The neighbors dogs are chiuhachuas (sp?) so maybe nothing will stop them but at least I feel like I'm doing something. At least the owners are as bothered by my Bark Free as I am by the dogs. It does get triggered by wind but I unplug it then. I got a complaint from a seperate neighbor who day sleeps and I happily pointed out that it only beeps when the dogs bark so ask the dog owners to stop the dogs and the beeping will stop too. It was worth the money only because I feel like I'm doing something and am not helpless, not because it quiets the dogs."
1,VERY loud to humans too,"Be careful when testing - the one I received must have been painfully defective. I selected the mode where it'll make a sound that people can hear as well, and the sound was so very loud as to be painful to people. Seriously, 18 hours later and my ear which was closest to it when I tested still hurts and feels like it has cotton stuffed into it. The ultrasonic-only mode made everyone in the house complain too. Clearly the unit was broken, but if you buy this device, use it cautiously at first. I returned it and I don't plan to buy another."
2,Disappointed,"This product may work for some breeds of dogs, but it doesn't have any effect on my two Jack Russell's. It clicks and they just keep on barking."
2,Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,I have not had any success with my dogs on this product. The dogs simply ignore the sound and keep on barking. I am very disapointed in the product.
1,not worth the money,This thing doesn't work with my 3 shih tzu dogs ether on high freq. or low freq. followed instrictionsNo luck.Bought a $10. hand held unit and had much better luck
1,Disappointed dog owner,"What a disappointment. No matter what we set the control on, our 3 dogs never stopped barking. What a waste!"
2,Im on the fence,"Well it seemed to work for about 3 days. I have 2 German Shepherds. About 8 months old. It seemed they had gotten used to it. I tried to change it to audible to see if that would help once they seemed to ignore it. I will have to say that one of the dogs still stays away from it but, The other dog doesn't care at all. So I am on the fence to whether or not this product was worth buying. I wish the unit had more options (maybe louder or different tones) to choose from. More options may have helped in my situation. The dog that ignores it is a VERY stubborn dog but now what do I do?"
3,better than nothing,Does work somewhat. It takes a little for dogs to get used to the sound. It also doesn't seem to work as far away as they say. Has controlled barking of our two dogs about 80% of the time.
1,Junk,"Maybe the one I got is defective, but it actually does seem to be making the noises it's supposed to make. Unfortunately, it has no particular effect on my dogs. They glance at it and keep on barking, and sometimes my Pomeranian even walks up to the device and intentionally barks at it, in time with the chirps, both audible and inaudible (depending on setting - I've tried both). He seems to think it's fun!Don't waste your money."
1,Didn't work for my dog.,"The reviews were mixed for this item. It seemed it either worked, or it didn't. I thought I would give it a shot. It didn't work for my dog. Just caused him anxiety but didn't stop the barking. I'm returning it."
1,wasted money,the device is working but our dog does not stop barking. I feel that has been ripped off. Do not recommend this device to anyone.
4,Did the job in no time!,"I have two dogs, a rott and a terrier mix (half rat terrier, half angry old man). Whenever anyone walked by our house, they would go off like the world was coming to an end. I tried everything I could think of, but nothing worked.2 days of bark-free, and I have a quiet house again, yay! The pulse really does the job, now people can walk by or even come to the door and my boys keep calm.You have to be pretty particular about where you place it, it took me a few tries to find just the right spot. Loud noises will set if off too, so if you are going to be hammering or anything you need to turn it off.Patience is like a bank account, you only get so much. If your dog is driving you nuts, I would highly reccomend this device."
2,Didn't work,I purchased this item thinking it would abate the barking from a neighbor's dog! Used it for several months without any success. The claims made by this company (in my opinion) are untrue. Do not buy this item! It doesn't work! It was a waste of money and I don't understand why Amazon is selling this item. Since it's been over two months I can't return this item for a refund. Please be aware of Amazon's return policy!
1,Did not work on my Cockapoo.,"I ordered this item so I would not have to put a shock collar on my puppy to keep him from barking. However, the noise seems to make no difference when he is barking. I've left it up in hopes that it will eventually make a difference. But so far, no luck."
1,Just Didn't Work,"Boy, was I ever hopeful when I ordered this item because I have a high pitched barking bichon. Her bark is like fingernails on a chalkboard. So, after trying shock collars, which made me feel horrible, we tried this device. It didn't do a thing. I also have a Shih Tzu, and neither one stopped barking at all. I gave it a try. Amazon was good about returning it, though. They make things easy."
1,NO GOOD,"waste of money, don't even try it thinking it will work for your dog. My dog kept barking at it because it was a new think on the endtable."
4,Chihuahuas less barking,"This product works for my 2 chihuahuas. They still do bark, but not as often and continously. I have only used it indoors."
1,didn't work for me,I have two Chihuahuas and a Huskey. They bark when someone is at the door or when a leaf falls in Vermont. Not even when set on high did this device slow them down. They still bark as loud and as long as ever. Sigh.
1,Total Waste,"I have a medium Chow/Terrier mix and a small Min Pin. They barked AT it! The tone to get them to stop never sounded. I did it manually and they just stood there and barked AT it. I think they were laughing at it. The only way this would get them to stop barking is if I threw it at them (which I would never do).Don't waste your money or time.Also, the item was ultimately defective. I would plug it in and it would not stay ""on"". The power cord/jack was screwed up."
5,After reading all the reviews I was sceptical,"I needed something to stop my small dog from yapping at every sound and everyone. After reading all reviews I was sceptical, but still was willing to try it. One of the 5 star reviews stated that it didn't stop immediately but took some days to take affect. This was also true in my case. It does'nt work immediately and it doesn't stop all barking but it subsides the constant barking. After 2 days my little dog just barks once or twice then stops. Voila! It did work! The true test will be when the hot air balloon rally comes to town. My dogs bark constantly on those days. I will let you know how that goes. :)"
5,yahoo it works.....,freak'n little yappy SOB shuts-up now!the owners look puzzled...why ain't he yapp'n like normal.I just smile... =)
1,Just doesn't work!,"What can I say, the product doesn't even slow down the dog parking. Tried multiple settings from low to high sensitivity; even tried the audio which irritated the neighbors enough to call the cops. Either the dog is deaf or the product is a bust."
1,"Ultrasonic doesn't work, human-audible works but annoying","The device works when set to human-audible sound. It works, make the sound every time a dog bark. Which make the dogs stop barking. But the sound is very annoying. When I set it to ultrasonic. The dogs no longer care about the device. period."
2,Bark Free - Almost there,"I bought the Bark Free on the advice of a friend who said it worked well with her dog. I got it for my terrier as I moved into a new apartment and didn't want to disturb my neighbors. Based on the reviews posted here I turned on the audible tone so I could hear what set off the device. Being a rather loud sneezer, I realized my sneezes set off the device quite a bit. Also when I was doing the dishes the pots clanging would set off the device. My dog was aware of the sound and it would limit his barking to maybe 2 barks but then he bark again and his barking was a little less, but he was still barking. In the end I decided to return the item as it was too sensitive and a lot of things set it off, making the association with the barking and the sound of the device probably hard to tell to my dog. It did condition me to be more aware of my sneezing...but I can't really control how many times I sneeze...and it's not called the sneeze free human training device."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this product to help keep one of my dogs from barking, because once she does, she sets off the others and it is only a matter of time until you can hear them from the driveway, in a car. However, it didn't work. My dogs continue to bark and have only stopped due to learning patience not because of this anti barker. My advice, work with you dog in order to get them to accept being in a crate instead of buying something this useless."
1,Did not work for me,My neighbor's dog wakes me up every day .I bought this hoping it would help. I tried all settings. It made no difference at all.It was a waste of time and money for me.
3,maybe,it does what it says it will do. but the dog doesn't always do what he is supposed to do. they bark it makes noise. they don't seem to always stop.
1,Possibly the biggest piece of junk I've ever bought.,"My title says it all. It's junk. I say ""possibly"" only because I've bought some junk in my day, and this one might be the absolute junkiest. It's a tough call."
1,Not so well,"This product, did not work in my home. Maybe, it's not the product and it's the dog, but it did nothing for us."
5,Perfect for meeting rooms,"We have purchased six of these in the last five years. No failures. They are all installed in meeting rooms that have overhead projectors. When a custormer or vendor has a dog and pony show to put on the projector, they simply plug the VGA plug and the audio plug, that are on top of the meeting table, into their laptop. The projector and audio are switched from the meeting room PC and sound system to the laptop."
3,basic 2-d,"a basic 16-bit 2d adventure button masher. the only real way to advance through the stages is to tap one of the two attack buttons. graphics aren't impressive and ""cut scene"" story lines are (like most s-nes games) are as stale as frozen bagels. rather mediocre, compared to other games of same category."
3,this is a game where you have to like aliens ad predator!,this game is old but it is still awsome the concept of the two most awsome movie villans goin agents each other is just un herd of for 1993GRAPHICS: for super nintendo(SNES) the graphics are ok.abit glitchy though.SOUND: the sound basicaly is ok but needed some work. instead of pow and boom it was pooofffff and booofff and kkkkssshhhGAMEPLAY: this is what kills this game. the gameplay [is bad]!!!using 3 buttons for the entire game gets boring fast there is one button that does everything for offense you can only punch!SUM IT UP: the game did ok iv seen better. if i were you i would buy it used for a cheaper price!
3,ON EVERY BOARD THERE ARE ALIENS.,"THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS REAL GOOD.THERE IS A LOT OF ALIENS IN THIS GAME BIG,LITTLE AND EGGS TOO."
4,An educational and entertaining look at the water around us.,"Birds in the Waterfall takes you on a round-the-world tour of the water in, over and all around us. You will never look at water the same way again. Filled with facts to challenge any textbook, it nevetheless reads like an adventure novel. A great read!"
4,Review as Gift for User,"Since I have previous experience with Binoculars; and especially NIKON products and their superior Lense's (both in Camera's and Binoculars) I chose this one as a Gift for my Daughter who lives on the 9th Floor or a Beach Front Conduminium in Juno Beach, FL thus a great Ocean, Beach and Coastal Viewing range, Day and Night; and also beautiful Views to the westinland N, S, & West. These Binoculars have been a great and welcomed Giftby my 53 Year old Daughter; and is enjoying them each day.JLQ 5/2012"
4,Nikon Action 16x50 Binoculars,For the price these are pretty decent binoculars. The glass is clear and focusing is good. Overall I am real happy with the purchase.
4,Great Product for Animal Waiting,"I bought this pair of Binoculars beore I set out for a trip to Yellowstone Park.This product proved to be great for animal watching: clear, stable and easy to use. My wife is happy with it comparing with a 20X60 spotting scope we borrowed from a friend, I am ok with both though.Great price for a Nikon too!"
5,Geeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrraaaaattttttttttttttttt,"For the price . . . You can't beat these Binoculars !!! Perfect for us . . . Bird watching, boat watching & Mt. Rainer watching !!"
2,Cheaply Made,"The binoculars are cheaply made. If you look through the the other end with some light, you'll the big globs of glue holding things in place."
5,Great Mailers,"These mailers are great for larger books, especially the mass produced hardcover bestsellers. They provide adequate pading to prevent damage to books at least. I would personnally not use them for anything fragile. The glue strip fastens securely, and labels adhere to exterior without difficulty. It is good to have an inexpensive product that you can depend on to do the job you want them to."
3,Not up to par,"These envelopes are not as sturdy as our usual, bubble lining in many was not secured to the paper. We will go back to our old supplier."
4,Great Deal on these Mailers,These padded mailers are a great value for the money..They could be a little mare padded but they offer real and great value for the money..I have used these for the last 2 weeks and have not incurred any rips or tears when processing mail orders for my customers..
1,DON'T BUY THESE!!!,These are the worst bubble mailers ever. First of all they are a lot thinner than the real Kraft bubble mailers. Most of the bubbles already lost their air. What's most annoying is that when you're trying to remove the seal strip it rips the envelope and there's absolutely no glue left to seal the envelope. I'm not able to use these envelopes. VERY DISAPPOINTED. If I would've known I would've ordered more expensive bubble mailers from a different seller.
1,junk and waste of money,"I get my supply from few sellers on Amazon and I decided to give this company a try and I was sorry to waste my money on them.I ordered size 4 and size 1Size 4: I noticed that most of the item I was able to fit in size 4 from value mailer, could not fit in size 4 from this seller so I measured that inside and outside and is a little smaller compare to the product from value mailer. SO I had to use size 5 instead of 4 to mail my items. I have same size of items I shipped all the time and I had to use lots of size 5. that cost me some money and waste of envelopes Yellow material is very cheap and tears out easy when trying to pack.Same thing with number 1i do not know how amazon allows these people to sell their stuff when you are not getting what you paid for. I guess amazon do not give a dang as long as they get their commission.Now I ordered all sizes from china and it cost me less than half and great quality. So now I understand why china is taking all the jobs."
2,Very light & flimsy mailers,"I bought these mailers because the listing mentions that they are made with heavier paper than most but the reality is that these are the lightest, flimsiest mailers I have ever purchased and am now having to use more paper inside, around the product I am mailing to provide substance and protection. I reached into the box to pull some out as they were naturally packed in snugly and the tops of about four mailers just easily tore off in my hands. Very disappointing; I won't buy them again."
2,Good and functional,Good item for the price. Next time owever I will takw a closer look at Samsonite carrying cases.
3,RAL,"I purchased this bag for my D80 with 18-135 lens. I think the quality is good, but the size was a bit bigger than I really wanted. I was looking for a bag to basically hold the D80 and some memory cards. This bag is about twice the size that I needed. But I guess it was my fault for not really checking the size, since the description did mention it. The thing that I don't like about the bag are the 4 quick release buckles (QRB) which hold the top on. Personally, I think it should have had a zip top and possibly one quick release buckle in the center. It just isn't quick enough to have to buckle/unbuckle 4 QRB's everytime you have to get into the bag. It kind of drives me crazy. But if you can get over that, the bag is descent and the price is great. Also, if you have several lenses it has the space to hold them. I'm still looking for a bag small enough to just cover the camera."
4,Nice Nikon bag!,"This bag is just what I needed for a digital SLR and three lenses. It is pretty big, which is why I didn't rate it perfect on portability, but that's to be expected if you want to carry a digital SLR and three lenses. The lid bothers me a little because it closes only with two plastic snaps and doesn't have a zipper that keeps the insides sealed off from dust or other environmental elements."
5,Awesome Product - Awesome Price!,Extremely well-crafted bag at a reasonable price! Comfortable shoulder strap and lots of compartments for storage of accessories!
4,Good case,"This is a good case, much space to store many camera objects and other features to facilitate the handling. It depends of the preference, a back pack case is easier to carry the camera to different places and this bag case is a good option for easiest camera handling."
1,Does not have a zip lock,Good quality product and spacious for my D90 with kit lens. BUT do not have zip lock !!!.The front two buckle-locks locks the bag cover and no zip lock provided. Returned it as I wanted the bag to store the camera at Home. The design would be handy while shooting though.One star coz of no mention about this in the product description. Ended up paying shipping and return cost which adds upto the bag cost :(
5,camera case for nikon,im very happy with this seller this is the second time i have ordered from cameta camera and ive have been very happy with the speed of the shipping and delivery the products are as described and are all brand new as stated i will recomend this place to all web buyers and i actually called and placed my order and the people i spoke to was very friendly and they knew what they were doing great place to buy from
2,Should've been free with the BIG$$ Camera & lens purchase!,"I purchased this bag in addition to the D300, a couple lenses, an extra battery pack, memory card, etc., etc. Bottom line: It should have been free. I've had this bag exactly ONE MONTH and the lining has already ripped away at the top seam in two places! I've handled this bag like it has a bomb inside....so for the lining to pull away at the top screams poor quality! Wish I had gotten a nice bag that would not only protect my camera but LAST, too! Not to mention how unprofessional it looks when I open my camera bag and you see white foam exposed around the top!"
5,Good for the Money,"When I was a kid, I paid the insane amount of $79.00 for a Tamrac nylon camera bag back when it was in vogue to buy the Domke Pro style canvas bags. That Tamrac bag lasted me twenty-five years. The foam in the Tamrac eventually started to disintegrate. Oh well.I just got this Nikon bag, and I can tell right off the back, that I'll probably be using this bag until I retire. It looks like the same quality, but of course only time will tell. If all you carry is a body or two, a flash and a couple of lenses, this bag will fit them all nicely, and snugly.WARNING: This bag is NOT for those that use long (300s, 500s, and 70-300s) lenses.We will post back after some field testing."
5,NIKON CAMERA BAG,I have a Nikon D300 camera. The case is well made and holds my camerawith the battery grip attached and it holds my SB800 flash and assorteditems like extra batteries and lens cleaning kit. The price was great. After searching the internet I found the best price @ Amazon.com.I received my order with in 5 days. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,great bag,"I am new to the dslr world and picked this bag based on the good reviews. It is a very high quality bag. The size is perfect for me because I will only have two lens to carry around. Maybe if you had a ton of stuff you may want a bigger bag, but really it is not that small and anything bigger would be huge for me. If I really needed something small on a particular day I would probably take my point and shoot canon and throw it in my purse. I also carry all the other cords etc that came with my camera so I can have it all in one place. Overall, I am really happy with this purchase and have no complaints."
5,Better than expected,"I received the bag and was immediately impressed. It looks great and is also great quality. It easily holds my Nikon D60, two lenses (18-55mm and 55-200mm), cleaning kit, charger, and a SB-600 speedflash, and it still has room for more. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good bag."
4,Nice Basic Bag,"This bag is plenty big for me; I have a D-200 with an 18-200 lens attached most of the time and it fits vertically into the bag just fine. There is also room for another couple of lenses, flash, batteries and other accessories. I wouldn't want to carry around any more.The only problem I have with this bag is the shoulder strap that I wish was wider, or had a padded piece over the shoulder. If you fill this bag, it can get to be a pretty heavy load.All in all though, it's a well-constructed, functional bag at a reasonable price."
2,doesn't last,Two people in my office bought this bag. After only a few months one has a handle that is wearing out the other has the lining coming loose.
5,Nikon users!! still looking for a quality bag!? this is it!,"i spent about few weeks searching a bag for my nikon D70s, sigma 17-35mm, nikon 50mm, nikon 28-80, nikon 70-300, and nikon SB-800 flash light. those stuff can just prefect fit in this bag, and I feel really happy with the ""nikon"" logo all over the inside of bag; this just looks great and look like it worth more than this price. this bag is pretty light, but still gives a good protection to my camera and lenes. now i can put all the nikon stuff in this bag, and carry it to anywhere i want..."
3,Nikon Bag Review,"Nice on the inside - spacious. Hard to open bag - especially if you are in a hurry to get that perfect picture. There are two ""fastners"" on the front and two on the side. One should not have to squeeze that hard to get the bag open (but maybe it's just the one I got). Other than that I like it. I'd give it 3-1/2 stars."
1,Nikon Digital Case Gadget Bag,"The Nikon Digital Case Gadget Bag described as one which would be fitting for use with a Nikon D300 Digital Camera. This is not true for me. I bought the bag for my D300 which is fitted with a Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G lens. In my case, I have wasted my money and will be forced to purchase another bag since this one is too small for that combination. Buyers should be advised that there are restrictions applying to the bag when the buyer is purchasing it for either the Nikon D300 or the Nikon D200 camera should those cameras be fitted with any lens greater than 3 1/2 inches in depth. Quality and design are very good."
3,You'll never know until you see it!,"I bought this at $35 from another seller from amazon. If you have a budget for an SLR bag at this price range then it might be worth it to consider this product BUT don't expect much with its looks and style. Here are some decriptions:1.Size-(12x8x8)bulky but spacious for beginner's kit.2.Style-looks like a regular bag (nothing special about it)3.Material:-Nylon fabric looks durable-""NIKON"" leather emblem looks like a knock off from Chinatown (this is the downside that makes the whole bag looks cheap)-Shoulder strap ""looks"" flimsy ."
4,Nikon Gadget bag.....it should look cooler,"Great bag, lots of space for lenses and extra equipment. I can easily fit my d90, the stock lense, and my new 300mm lens, along with a external flash in this thing with room left over more more do-dads and the what not. Its shoulder strap has a nice padding on it so its not painful to wear, and the quaility of the bag overall is rather nice. I just hate those damn velcro walls you put to make compartments. Though I guess thats the only way to do it where you can set your own bag up. Reason I only gave it 4 out of 5 is the velcro, and the way ti looks. All black, no style. Weres my Nikon yellow?"
5,"Awesome bag, mine was substituted for a better model!","This bag is bigger (I have a D40 w/ lens attached, 55mm to 200mm lens and all cables) in it and can still fit 1 or 2 more lenses. Plus there is still room in the side, front and top pockets.The bag I recieved looks alot like the one pictures (Nikon lining). However, the sides and bottom are hard case (nice!)with rubber feet on bottom. Someone else also posted about the Nikon logo on the front... mine was a full metal badge that looks a lot better.Either I was sent the newer model of this bag, or Cameta Camera sent me a better one because the one I ordered was not in stock. Thanks Cameta!Overall, this bag is excellent! Lots of room to grow, lots of pockets, nice hard shell, easy clip pop top design, and it's NIKON."
4,Olympus Camedia C755,"The picture quality is crystal clear. Eventhough it came with good instructions most of the symbols on the camera were self explanatory. It had an easy learning curve. I like all the different features. In auto mode it adjusts automatically to focus on the subject matter giving you the perfect shot. Like most digital cameras, I wish it was a bit faster when snapping the shot.As an added bonus it had a great rebate!"
3,disappionting,because it takes so long to take a picture. The features are great and the variety of options is good but by the time yoiu snap the picture the figure is a blurr because the camera has not caught up with the shot. Buy the next model up it is a better use of the money.
1,It was nice when it worked,"I've had this camera for approximately 2 months. Tonight I am suddenly unable to upload my pictures to my computer. It worked last time. The battery indicator says that they are fully charged, but when I plug in the USB cable, the screen goes black and the camera dies. I'd be much more forgiving but I have been on hold now for 25 minutes on the Olympus customer support line who is, surprise, surprise, ""Experiencing unusuallyhigh call volume""."
3,Adventure Touring,This video has good information for those just entering the adventure touring riding. Even though this is BMW F800 specific it also has general information useful to all who want to explore off-road riding. I found the Bio's of different riders and the modifications done to their F800's very interesting. It was helpful in making a more informed decision in my personal modification choices.
2,Beemer,"It will teach you how to chance a flat tire on the front and back of the bike. Also, they show you how to change the oil and other really basic stuff. That is it. I was expecting more."
4,Groundbreaking study is highly recommended,"Amin Malak's study of contemporary Muslim writers in English deserves to be widely read. In his own words, Malak articulates his terms of reference for judging the authors he is writing about as 'not ... ridiculing or rejecting the Islamic heritage, but ... appealing to its most enlightened and progressive tradition.' This is the criteria that enables him to strongly criticise Salman Rushdie's writings on Islam without denying their stylistic innovation. Among others, Malak also discusses the work of Atia Hosein and Abdulrazak Gurnah, writers who deserve greater recognition.Generous in his appraisals and unapologetically situating his analysis within the fields of modern literary theory, Malak has opened up an area that many students and general readers will find stimulating and original"
3,Good but not essential,"Louisiana born blues pianist Eurreal ""Little Brother"" Montgomery is featured on tracks 1 -11 as an accompanist. Tracks 7 - 11 date from his classic 1936 New Orleans session where he recorded 23 tunes in one sitting.Tracks 12 - 15 are 1947 Chicago band pieces featuring New Orleans trumpeter Lee Collins.Tracks 16 - 24 are solo recordings from the Savoy and Windin' Ball labels from 1949 - 1954. If not as good as his pre-war recordings, they feature Montgomery's take on some classic blues and boogie themes. ""Cow Cow Blues"" is a magnificent performance.This album has some good performances which collectors will want to obtain. For those wanting a single disc by Montgomery, the 1930-36 Complete Recordings disc, also from Document, is the one to get."
3,Cool BUT..,"Its a good intake, sounds sweet and all BUT it doesn't fit my 00 Civic 100% right. The support bar used to attach it to the car frame doesn't make any contact with the car so its just hanging there. It also has three holes for sensors and a hose but none reach it. They give you two plugs for them but the third hole is just there so i had to make my own plug. Another little problem is that on the manual it says; NOTE : LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA FOR RACING CARS ON A SPEEDWAY AND NOT FOR CARS THAT WILL EVER BE DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY. Yet they give you the little plate saying its CARB exempt. So its illegal but it will still pass the smog test. I don't know but I'm a bit disappointed."
3,Does it come with a carb sticker?,"It sounds stock up until about 3,000 RPMs. It has a deep tone to it and it doesn't sound like an obnoxious ricer's system. It sounds nice and I got what I expected. Definitely worth the money. Even if the intake system only came with one mount you would be fine"
2,slow shipping!,such slow shipping time! had 2 day shipping and its been 3 days and they havent even shipped it.
2,Not what I wanted,I Got this intake and put in the my car model and everything and when I installed the intake it did not fit my car. I took out the air box and put it back for no reason. Idk in terms of it working. Maybe Its just my car that it didn't fit but Definitely didn't I wanted.
5,The authors' name says all.,"The text consists of words beginning with B with a minimum of any other words. This is a great idea for teaching beginning readers, and I wish there were more books like this.The illustrations are cute and the the story is funny. In other words, it's by the Berenstains.If you like the Berenstains, and if you like picture books with alliterative text, then you have two good reasons to try C is for Clown, 0001714422."
4,The Berenstain's B book,The berenstain's B book is about a book that every word in the book starts with a B.It keeps going on and keeps adding on phrase after phrase with words that start with B.The story teaches not to have words that all start with B's or you will break...........The book was a good book. It was at a reading level of 1st grade.
3,A celebration of B,"This Book is funny and is full of B words, like ""big brown bear, blue, bull, beautiful baboon...."" Another B phrase is added each time so by the end it's a long phrase. There is a surprise at the end for a sad Baby Bird. (my daughter dictated that paragraph)This isn't Berenstain Bear family book, with Mama, Papa, Sister and Brother but is a celebration of an important letter. It's fun to read out loud with a swingy feel to it."
1,Wilton gum paste,"When I mixed up my first batch, it was hard as a rock with the recommended 1/4c of water. Any videos you see out on the web, and it's supposed to be rather messy and a bit on the soupy/dough side. This was like hard dough that had too much flour mixed in. It stuck in big chunks to the mixing paddle, and trying to knead it was all but impossible.Skip this product and just mix up a batch from a website recipe instead - it's not worth the time, money, or aggravation you're going to encounter."
3,It's Okay,"I took a chance and purchased this version of the Nutcracker after not seeing any reviews. The film looks like it was recorded from the back of the audience to stage (a bit home video quality). The stage is not the most interesting or pleasing to the eye, but the dancers are extremely talented presenting some wonderful performances. For the price, it is not a bad deal, but I would probably save your cash and splurge on a better production that you will want to watch over and over again."
3,It's OK,"This version is a bit boring. The main girl isn't a girl at all, she's a woman. And better lighting could have made it a little less dark and spooky. I bought it for my 6 year old daughter who loves the live show but she won't even watch this one."
2,Its ok at what its made to do,It's not poorly made really. I just don't really get the fun of playing these games like poker and craps and stuff if there is no real money on the line. And not just that really i guess it's also no fun to play card games and stuff unless you are playing against real poeple to me.
1,Another Decent Sports Game Highly Overrated,"I don't get why some of these games are rated so highly, when there just not that good. sega's MVP series is a lot better then this one. 2 stars."
4,"Harry Chapin, An Evening With","I remember where I was when Harry died and how sad my sister was on hearing the news.It was then I began lessoning to his music and been a fan ever from that day. This DVD is of his early works but having never seen him on TV, placed a face against the music. Worth a viewing to any fan."
2,"Early Chapin, but low quality video","I am a big Harry Chapin fan, but this video doesn't do him justice. It's video and audio quality is uneven. There are some nice moments, but for the most part this video dissappoints. It is closer to VHS than DVD quality."
1,Money Wasted !,I saw this item highly recommened in several cooking magazines. After looking for several weeks I found one. I was extremely unhappy when it didn't work accurately right from the get go. I was not surprised to find that the needle didn't even budge the second time I used it.PLEASE don't buy this much over-rated thermometer.
2,Dissapointed,"The thermotmeter failed the second tiem I used it, the pointing needle got stuck and it did not give a reading. For ten bucks I would not go through the hassle of returning it so I disassemble it and unstuck the needle, but it got stuck again the next time I used it. Definitly not a good experience from such a simple product, which appeared to be very reliable, but wasn't."
1,Stinks on Ice,"I bought this to replace a Polder oven thermometer that had a shattered face. Worked once, now the needle is stuck at six o'clock. Unacceptable, I will replace it with a different brand."
2,Died after 40 days,The pointer got stuck and does not move after about 40 days after purchased. Thats about 15 usage. Careful when buying this item.
1,Just awful!,"The day I received this thermometer, I placed it in the oven and preheated the oven to 350F just to check it out. After 30 minutes, the thermometer read 340. I figured that was pretty good for a first try and turned the oven off.The next day I preheated the oven to 425F, but after 30 minutes, the thermometer only read 350F. I baked what I needed to bake and turned the oven off. 4 hours later the oven was stone-cold and the thermometer still read 350. What a piece of junk!"
1,Icky looking base and DOA,"Just got this.I'd swear it was used by looking at the base- dirty and/or possibly rusty spots on it; except that it is in a new, completely sealed package.Then can't help but notice while moving the package trying to get a better look at the base that the need is spinning freely on the dial.Obviously broken. DOA.What ever happened to quality control?!? Must not have that department in China. :/"
1,Not accurate AT ALL,"I put this thermometer into a oven with 300 F and it showed OVER 600F. I took it out from the oven and it still stayed at ""over 600F "" for couple minutes. I would like to return it or replace a new one to give it a second chance. Very disappointed to Taylor."
1,A therapy for a dysfunctional marriage,It is sad that so many people have bought into the restoration myth. This book is a sad example of this growing nonsense. Any man who claims that a foreskin saved his marriage is eithier in denial about that marriage or overestimated the trouble the couple was suffering in the first place. The inactivist movement will stop at nothing in making circumcised men feel like victims. This book is a shameful example of this. She interviews a handful of women and concludes that uncircumcised sex is bettter based on that tiny sample. This is a pathetic attempt to make the world fall into the inactivist camp. I find it hard to believe that she did not go into the psychological and physical pain that many intact boys feel due to mis functioning foreskins. I know several young men that have been cut in thier early 20's and they have no regrets. This book should be taken with a big grain of salt.
4,A nice surprise,"First of all, I do not own the CD...I acquired this album on vinyl along with a few hundred other records, and was surprised by the very high production level, and being on a MCA Master series ""audiophile"" type vinyl record, the sound quality was very very good. The music itself is basic but nice / feel good variety 80's type music. Worth a listen if you run into it."
4,Lindsey Davis novel,This is a fairly gripping non-Falco historical novel. The characters are gripping and the action moves along... It's interesting that it's described as a novel about the relation between Vespasian and a slave who's described as 'a bad-tempered slavey' and who eventually becomes the prosperous freedwoman Caenis [...]; although they spend fairly little time together there is a constant emotional connection.
3,Not a Falco novel.,"THE COURSE OF HONOUR, while set in generally the same time period as her Marcus Didius Falco series, is not a Falco novel. The description for this is misleading. Although an enjoyable book in its own right covering Vespasian and his slave-mistress, it is not part of the Falco series."
3,better falco than course of honour,"good book, but Lindsey davis falco books are better. the historicial part is correct and very interesting, worth the money and time it takes to read it!"
2,Was this originally a Master's Thesis?,"Being a great fan of Lindsey Davis's ""Marcus Didius Falco"" historical mysteries, in which we get to meet the heroine of this book, I had expected great writing, a fast moving tale, and -- very likely -- first person, either told by Vespasian or Caenis, or perhaps a mutual acquaintance. I'd expected fictional devices like flashbacks and witty conversation on every page.Instead I got rather worshipful, not too well-characterized third-person chronological narrative of a former slave who became an emperor's mistress. Long passages were without conversation (or very much human interest). My conclusion was that this book was derived from the author's Ancient History MA thesis or PhD dissertation, not the best source for exciting fiction.The Falco novels are a thousand times better."
2,Around the course,Another L. Davis Roman gumshoe adventure. It is entertaining and very similar to other books by the same author on the same subject. Good light reading.
5,Great Price - Great Book,"I'm recently trying to improve my guitar skills and this book helps. I like Collective Soul specifically because their music features so much guitar. This book enables you to play with their CD's and sound right on (well almost, depends on skill). It shows the written music and tablature both. I would recommend this book."
4,Paddock boots,"These are good-looking boots and my daughter, who rides horses weekly, really likes them - comfortable and easy to put on (she's always had the lace-up style and likes these a lot better). Fast shipping as well - overall, a positive experience."
3,"Nice boots, but the sizing is way off!","I chose these boots because they were exactly what my daughter needs and the price is 'right'. However, once we received them we realized that the sizes are way off, so they were sent right back!"
3,Thelonius Turkey,"The book was in good condition, and my students really enjoyed it, but next time I would not buy books unless it's from Amzon per se not independent sellers because it took a lot to get here."
5,great supplement,I really enjoy this stuff. Makes me feel more energetic. I buy only this brand because other brands didn't taste as good.
4,Remington All That 2 in 1 curling iron/ straightener,I am please with the product. I previously owned this product and it broke that is why I searched until I found a location to purchase another. I like the fact I can curl parts and straighten parts of my hair and not have to have numerous products to do so. I recommend this product.
3,Interesting forewarning,"In the aftermath of the September 11th tragedy, it is eerie that the same number of planes suffers similar disasters. This book is a little below par of her other books. The absence (in a crime-solving capacity) of Mac and Annabel Smith left a void in the story. The other characters were predictable and not well developed. In all, it was a good story that needed more work on the characters."
2,Way too much information,"This was the first book that I read of the Capital Crimes series. It is a very slow read and I had to make myself finish it. I would have liked for this book to either have a dozen less characters, or 200 more pages so that more time could be spent explaining relationships between characters and more details of scenes such as the FBI standoff."
3,Panic,Only someone who has seen and experienced the tainted colorful scene of Washington DC could do this story justice. Three downed airlines in the US causes many to hit the terrorist's panic button. Mean time a murder in a park called Foggy Bottom is overshadowed by the fear of terrorists thus being ignored by most except for one maverick reporter.Truman brought in every government organization with a three-letter acronym pointing out how very easily the people of the world can be manipulated by a few people when panic is present.
1,At the Bottom,"Margaret Truman's books have always been hard for me to put down. I've very much liked them, until now. This one has far too many characters, and is not on a par with her earlier books, as far as the plot or holding one's interest. Sort of a jumble, really."
1,Sizing COME ONNNN,"I wish they would describe in their description that an XL is not going to fit alot of people who wear an XL. So I will.....IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS TEE SHIRT AND YOU WEAR AN XL....I WOULD SUGGEST ORDERING A XXL. I have better things to do than package up and drive to the post office, and wait in line at the post office to return a $7.50 tee shirt and I have to pay for return postage because they cannot describe correctly."
5,Great Darwin T-Shirt,"Love this shirt. It has a great Darwin fish that stands out pretty good and it washed fine without shrinkage. I got XXL knowing this t-shirt would be kind of small from another review, (my hubby usually wears XL) and it fits great."
5,Adorable cookie jar,I collect Santa Christmas Cookie Jars and this one was adorable. My grandchildren love it too. Nice size for displaying in a larger space.
2,Peg Hooks and brooms,"The peg hooks I bought I hoped would be sturdy enough to hold a broom, but, alas, they are not. Useful for holding something like a rubber mallett, but not something larger."
2,Content very average,No new or ground breaking techniques in this book. The book gives very basic information and even misses some essentials about sleep that could have easily been included. The book states it will get to the point but does a lot of waffling with little substantial information.
3,It's okay,"This book was good. I gave it only 3 stars because I had already done prior research about getting my baby to sleep (due to our own sleep deprivation and desperation) that when I bought this book, it just reiterated what I already knew. The one thing that it did help though was to normalize my situation for me and make me feel like I was doing that bad after hearing worse stories from the book."
3,doesnt work for everyone,The tools and techniques in this book are nothing revolutionary in my opinion. But it is good info for anyone who knows nothing about infant sleep cycles. The no cry solution doesn't work for everyone.
2,Not at all what I expected,"This book complicates the whole process.I also found that the author repeated herself over and over again. I may be sleep deprived, but I am not an idiot."
3,Explains babies sleep patterns well,"I'm afraid I'm in the minority here by not rating this book a 4 or 5, but I found the suggestions of getting through nighttime parenting either simplistic or unrealistic to apply to everyone's situation. I was not able to use much of the suggestions.That said, this book does a very good job of explaining babies sleep patterns and was worth the read just for that."
5,Good read!,A little repetitive if you read the naptime book first. You can get both (I did) but its probably not necessary. Has a good chart on realistic amount of hours to sleep and explains sleep cycles. How's many suggestions to try as far as getting your LO to sleep. Good book :)
2,Unfortunately it didnt work for us,"We tried this for first 6 months as I didnt want to let my baby CIO. However after that, my baby was waking up more frequently 6-8 times, track record was 3 times per hour. I was so tired and the entire household was falling sick due to sleep deprivation. I decided to take a more firm yet gentle approach as advocated by Kim West, Good night Sleep Tight. I strongly recommend this book as we saw results on the first night. From 6.-8 times to 1 night waking and naps were longer and more quality once he has learn how to fall asleep on his own. Perhaps this book will work for babies with milder temperament and older babies who can comprehend and understand. Note that the author's son was about 12 months when she successfully solved his sleep problems with her methods."
4,"A worthwhile purchase, but just one piece of the puzzle...","This book includes some great techniques as well as some helpful psychological insights. (For instance, that not all moms really *want* to give up nighttime feedings because it's a special time with their babies.) I'd recommend getting ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" as well, though. It has more concrete info about sleep cycles and what kind of sleep needs babies have at different ages."
4,Learn patience & make a routine,"I learned patience and made a new routine for me & baby.After reading this book I figured out that your baby will not go to sleep and will keep waking up on the middle of the night unless you make sure she's well fed enough during the day, have a comfy atmoosphere around her room in her own crib, have her bathed before going to bed along with a nice massage. If you skip a single feeding then that'll make her wake up at night, so make sure she's fed enough so her tummy's full and everybody's happy.Good luck!"
1,nothing new,"the book promises to get your baby to sleep through the night - eventually. Well, that might be true. The author has 4 children, but the problems she seemed to have with No. 4 are hard to believe. Did she REALLY not know that you should take your baby to bed when she is tired? Did she REALLY think it is necessary to breastfeed a 10 month old every 2!! hours? Well if you take your baby to bed far too late, if you have no routine and if you think feeding is the only way to make your baby quiet, maybe this is your book.I am more flexible than that and think most of the ideas in that book would fit on about 3 pages."
2,nothing new,"Unfortunately, Elizabeth failed to enlighten me with any profound secrets ""guaranteed"" to get my child to sleep.All the options she offered, while gentle, have all been previously mentioned in other books/literature I've read.I had already been using/trying the methods she's described for my situation.Sadly, I'm still right where I started - sporadic sleep, and now $...poorer for having bought this book."
1,Not a fan,I started reading this book because a friend recommended it but the start just talks about how horrible the progressive waiting method is and how traumatic it is for children (untrue btw). I decided to stop reading it as it lost all of credibility from me. If someone is going to based her book on talking bad things about other methods it's just not right. Ferber doesn't talk about Dr. Sears or any other approach on his book.
1,Unpractical,"I would not recommend this book to tired Moms. It did not help me get my son to sleep through the night. I was getting depressed without a full night sleep in 6 months. I recommend Healthy Sleep Habits: Healthy Child by Marc Weissbluth. Letting your infant cry is not ""heartless"" it's necessary and it works! I'm a better mom when I get some sleep and my baby is happier now too."
3,Drawn out much longer than necessary,"I like the ideas of this book, but I'm halfway through it and she still keeps saying, 'we will get to that later on'. Good ideas for how to help baby, but seriously - get to the point!"
5,Excellent and Informative Book!!,"This book was very informative and helped me a great deal to understand how babies sleep. I only wished I had read this book when I was trying to get my first child to sleep on her own. I used the cry it out method for awhile until my husband and I decided we would no longer put our baby thru that. I have awful memories of seeing my baby suffering during that period. I'm so happy to find that there is a more nurturing, loving, way to teach our little ones how to sleep. I read the book, and tried the some of the tips/suggestions discussed in the book and after 10 days, I observed significant progress. This is truly an excellent book!!!"
3,"OK Starting Point, Not a Practical How-to Manual","This book ended up being a good resource for suggestions on how to get your baby to sleep without depending on nursing,etc, but definitely was not a definitive how-to guide. It requires such an intensive, time consuming commitment- to just understand the program, which after having read the book, I am still not sure I understand the program! It is more like alot of suggestions, and a rigid routine with way too many options, way too much confusion. Good luck to all of you, this book may help (especially if you read when your baby is a newborn, and institute the tips), but it was not an end all be all for me, or my nine month old!"
4,It works!!!,"After nursing and co-sleeping with our Baby from birth to 12 wks, transitioning to a crib was NOT going well. He would wake every hour OR LESS looking for the comfort of Mommy. My husband and I refused to let our son ""cry it out"". I read this book in one sitting and decided something had to be better than what we were doing. Although I did NOT take the time to log everything the author suggests, I did make mental notes to myself and kept track of our progress. After only a few days, our son started sleeping from 8pm-5am with two 15 min awake period for feeding. Now, after only 3.5 weeks of putting to use the suggestions in this book, he sleeps from 6:30pm to 6:30am with only ONE awakening for food....that's 12 hours with only ONE time up in the night! Our Baby is happy, healthy, and ""sleeps like a Baby""...so does Mommy and Daddy!! AND...most importantly...all of this was accomplished without a single tear thanks to ""The No-Cry Sleep Solution""!!"
5,Success!,"I haven't slept through the night in six years! Between two pregnancies and two children with night waking problems I was so tired! When my youngest was two years old, I *needed* a change! My son was waking up 10+ times a night (with every change in his sleep cycle)! He also had a strong sleep/suck association and could only fall back asleep by nursing. I was at a loss as to what to do! I was also exhausted and desperate, and just about ready to try to let him cry (something I did *not* want to do!) Then I found this book! We've been slowly implementing some of the ""No-Cry"" solutions into our sleep routine. Already my son has decreased his wakings to 2-3 times a night! I am sure that he'll be sleeping all the way through the night in a couple of weeks! This is a wonderful book. I wish I'd had it earlier! I am also a childbirth educator and certified doula. I'll definitely be recommending this book to my clients!"
4,Great ideas for Helping Baby,"This book gave me several good ideas for helping my baby go to bed at an earlier hour. I put two of these to use the same night (a pre-bedtime routine and an early bedtime hour) and I was surprised at how baby responded. He went off to sleep by 8:00 and slept until 7:15 the next morning! It has been working every night since.Also included are ideas for weaning baby from nursing and from co-sleeping. The author is a breastfeeding, co-sleeping mom and her book is supportive of those types of arrangements.The book is not , however, original. That is to say, everything that is suggested is something someone has done already. The book accumulates all of these successful ideas in one place."
1,Didn't work at all,"This was the worst book ever. It didn't work at all with my daughter. She actually slept worse after using this. Dr. Ferber's ""Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems"" was a life saver. She slept through the night after two nights using Ferber's methods. Plus, Ferber's book address sleep problems from birth to the teenage years. Don't waste your money on ""The No-Cry Sleep Solution."""
1,"If you have a newborn, DON'T waste your time!!","First of all, why can't authors who write books on baby sleep keep their books to 100 pages or less??? What kind of sleep-deprived parent has time to read 250 - 300 page books? Give me a break, people! Please re-think your strategy and call your editors!This book is simply a huge laundry list of things you can try to get your baby to sleep. No method or structure is offered. Sleep deprived, first-time parents need immediate, structured, clearly-defined, and PLEASE, TO-THE-POINT HELP.If you have a fussy, non-sleeping newborn, and you don't have time to sift through (and try) a huge laundry list of ideas, do NOT waste your valuable TIME and money with this one. Get ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" by Dr. Karp. This one worked miracles for us the FIRST night we used it!! It's almost as long, but it MUCH better organized and can be sped-read/skimmed in a few hours."
4,A lone freind in unknown teritory,"This book is very helpful to me because I don't know anyone else who sleeps with their child and I don't subscribe to the ""cry it out"" method. It has offered me more options than Dr. Sears' nighttime parenting book when it comes to identifying ways that will work for us to get our baby out of the bed and sleeping through the night on her own."
3,Good advice but now wowed.,Well written book with lots of great TIPS but it's method didn't wow me. Some of the advice is just pure common sense and info that cane be found with a google search. Overall not bad but don't expect too much.
3,The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night,"The book was really not that helpful. Much of the information was things my wife and I already knew. I would recommend ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" though."
1,Not very useful,"I bought both of the ""No-Cry Solution"" books but ultimately found them largely unhelpful. There are a few good tips, but they really perpetuated the problems we were having much longer than necessary. What we needed was a solid program not little adjustments that created more bad habits or perpetuated them. While the author encourages parents not to enter into certain bad habits, other things around nursing and sleeping, etc. seemed to make our problems worse. In the end, ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" and ""The Sleep Easy Solution"" were the two books that were life savors for us. They also are full of specific, clear help gleamed from professional experience with thousands of children rather than just one's own family."
2,"If you are looking for the exact how-to, this is not the book for you","I didn't feel this book useful for parent who looks for ways to improve baby's sleep. The author spent many paragraphs telling you what your expectation should be and why other parents did wrong, but does not offer enough details as to how to make it right and how to improve the current situation."
3,Maybe I didn't have enough patience...?,"I have to say that this book has some great ideas and I can see how they COULD work. I was so excited to find this book because I lean more toward attachement parenting philosophies, however, after about 2 weeks of trying I saw no improvment in my son's sleeping habits and had to try a different route. I still employ some of the techniques brought to light in this book, but I would rate our overall success as a failure in light of the lack of improvment. I think it's definately worth a try before you resort to cry it out methods."
4,Help for sleep deprived mommies!,"This book has many useful ideas for helping your child to sleep better. It is broken down into ideas for 0-4 months, and 4-months plus. It's an easy read. The author is adamantly opposed to letting your baby ""cry it out."" Her methods may take longer than the ""cry it out"" approach, but you can achieve success with them. The book includes logs so that you can really see what your baby is currently doing with his sleeping, and then you can log what happens after a period of time using the author's ideas. I've been working with her suggestions for about 3 weeks and my baby now has a much smoother bedtime routine and naps (with resistance) in his crib when he never would nap there before. So we're still working on it, but I'd say this book has definitely helped!"
2,Still looking for help...,"As I am writing this, my 18 month old twins are still up at 9pm after terrorizing me for 1 hour. I eagerly awaited this book, as my kids' sleep problems were affecting my every day life and relationship. Unfortunately, they still are. Ms. Pantley admits that her ""solution"" takes a lot of time and effort, but just about all she suggested, we have already done. One big difference is that we refuse to allow co-sleeping, which Ms. Pantley raves about. That's her choice, but it won't happen in this household. From all the other positive reviews, I suspect she has helped many many people. That's great, because I know what it is like to suffer from children's sleeping problems. But I found no helpful advice and didn't like the know-it-all tone of the author. The reason why I did not give less than 2 stars is because I know our case is a bit special since our problems are bigger, with twins. That said, I still found no new solutions in this book."
2,The No Sleep Cry Solution,"My husband and I tried the techniques recommended in this book. We followed them religiously for two and a half months. Although it is gentle (we aren't comfortable with crying it out), we found it completely ineffective in making any progress toward better sleep. Our son continued to wake up 7-8 times each night. We were able to soothe him back to sleep quickly each time, but we were never able to move through the different stages toward less intervention. After months of not getting more than an hour of sleep at a time, I was the one crying.I found Healthy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child to be more helpful and effective (although more difficult to read)."
1,Emty book. Total dissapointment,"My 16 month old baby wakes up couple of times a night. Doctor recommended this book to me trying to fix the problem without letting the baby cry. I thought I'd finally start sleeping thru the night finally!Started reading and realized that I was on page 22 and got no useful info so far (just that this helped my kids to sleep, I promise it'll help yours .....). Pretty amazing how you can take one phrase and turn it around so many times to fill in 22 pages! So somewhere in the middle of the book was my destination: I found out that if my baby is over one and wakes up twice a night, I shouldn't be doing anything about it because it's normal for child that age to wake up a couple of times. So there: If I didn't spend an hour of my time reading, I would've spent it getting more sleep. Sorry to say but waste of my time."
1,Only book I've ever thrown away!,"My wife read this and started a sleep diary, had us increase bedtime rituals (same lullabye CD every night), and had us rushing to the crib at the first sign of baby stirring... basically setting up several crutches so our daughter relied on us to put herself back to sleep. This works if you're willing to walk around like a zombie the next day because you've gotten up five times between 2am-6am. After reading other sleep books, my tired wife is of the opinion that baby may just need to fuss a few nights in order to learn better long-term sleep habits... yet she still has a hard time shaking the 'bad mother' feeling this book gave her. As a former Lit major and library rat, I've never defaced a book before, but this one was thrown in the trash with a big ceremony!"
2,Title Should Be...,"My sister said it all when i told her i bought this book. She said, ""Oh, i remember that book and technique. We call it 'The All-Cry No-Sleep Solution' in our house. Definitely only for those willing to CIO."
2,Not that helpful,"This book didn't teach me anything I wasn't already doing so it wasn't that helpful to me. In the end, we will probably have to try CIO because obviously what we are already doing is not working. Don't waste the money."
1,DESPERATE FOR SLEEP?,"Then don't waste your time reading this, its a too long journey, if you speak spanish, I recommend ""Duermete niño"", in a week my baby started to sleep through the night like a miracle."
2,No dice for no cry,"I was hoping to find some real concrete advise on getting my 7 mo old daughter to sleep, but it didn't pan out. The entire approach is based on examining and setting up routines, unfortunately, that was not part of our problem. I tried all of the methods outlined and my daughter is still in our bed for the bulk of the night. I will have to do the ""cry it out"" thing anyway, just with a lighter pocketbook!"
2,"I thought I agreed with the author, but now I'm a Ferberizer","I picked up this book because I was philosophically against letting my baby cry, but it didn't say anything I hadn't heard before... and it wasn't working. My daughter could not be put down, even if she was already deeply asleep, without waking up and bursting into tears. I finally went with the Ferber method - after reading his book, which I thought was excellent - and my daughter is sleeping incredibly well after very few tears. Elizabeth Pantley has some good things to say, but frankly, they didn't work for me."
3,Not a real clear book.,"There is a lot of information that was useful in this book. However, I thought that this book was just that: a lot of information. It wasn't that clear on how you supposed to go about her program then I would end up at the end of the book and wonder where's this program she was talking about. Maybe I missed the whole book, but either way this was still helpful in getting a plan together."
3,"It's not magic, but it can help","Some tips worked for us, some didn't. In the end, it's a laundry list of different things to try.Pick the techniques you want to try, and give it a shot. If you're buying this book, you're likely sleep deprived and desperate for anything that can help. Will this solve your child's sleep issues like magic in a day or two? No. Will it make things an little easier and have some tips that you can use? Yes."
1,made things worse,We followed this book to the letter and after a week things were worse than before. Before we started the book our son (8 months old) was waking every 1.5-2 hours at night after about a week of doing the suggestions in this book he was waking up every 45 mins. Once we stopped following the book he went back to his old routine. We will be trying something else.
3,"It's ok.... a bunch of opinions from one mom, ask the one next to you instead","I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews on it, but was rather disappointed. Seems to me like a classic case of 'did not want to work while raising my children, so tried writing a book instead'. It's not a BAD read, I just find that these are a set of tips/advice you can get from your close friends/ mom/ sister whoever else has brought up a couple kids. I also find that her opinions are quite strong, whereas I prefer neutral reads that allow you to form your own opinions and act freely based on provided information. I would recommend reading the 'naps' book on the whole sleep topic, which provides scientific-based information and allows you to make up your own mind about how to interact with your child on this whole 'sleep' topic."
3,"Good Intentions, but not so effective","I am not a parent who believes in letting thier baby 'cry it out' until they fall asleep, so I was very happy to find some alternative ideas. However, the author of this book gave a lot of good suggestions that worked for her, and most didn't work for me. She says to put your baby to bed at 7 or 8 at the latest, as they require 10-12 hrs of sleep - don't let them stay up too late in effort to avoid a 5am wake-up. This just doesn't work with either of my kids. When I put my baby to bed at 7, she is up at 3am - and I mean up for the day. Not all babies will go to bed early (as much as I would like mine to). Also, it didn't give any suggestions on how to get them to sleep in thier own crib rather than with you. Not a bad book, but it seemed her babies were easier to train than mine. If you're baby is mildly difficult at night, you might benefit. If you are pulling out your hair and are so sleep deprived that you are a zombie like me, I would not suggest it."
1,Not much of a book,"The author claims that her advice is working for attached parents as well, although throughout the book she claims that it's not normal for babies to fall asleep on the breast. Her method IS a kind of sleep training, and as it often doesn't work, parents end up using CIO on their babies, in order to break the breast-sleep association, which is clearly wrong.Also, in case anyone is wondering why the book has so many 5 star reviews, here's the secret - the author periodically posts messages on her Facebook wall, promising free book packages for those willing to write such a review. I have witnessed at least 3 of these posts, you were supposed to contact her by email for more details, as she deleted the request after 5 minutes, so that no trace would remain of her actions."
1,Absolutely Inane,"This book was absolutely the most useless book ever. Basically the book tells you to get up with your child, nurse them back to sleep, and keep a log of when they get up during the night. I bought it expecting that I would find a ""humane"" and ""unstressful"" way to get my son to sleep. After reading the book and trying to follow what little suggestion was given. I was severely disappointed and still completely sleep deprived.Not only did it not offer any solutions for getting my son to sleep, it only served to making me feel more guilty for even considering letting my son ""cry it out"". The whole first chapter is a diatribe on why parents are cruel if they let their child cry at all.If you really want help your child sleep through night, try Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. It is a much more practical approach that actually works. I only wish we had purchased that book first and never wasted our money on this one."
1,"This is not really a ""solution""...","I was so excited to receive this book, however upon opening it up, diligently reading through all the chapters, and FINALLY getting to the ""solutions"" part of the book, I was very let down. The jist of the book is to get a naptime, prebedtime, and bedtime routine going for your kid, and that will help them sleep all night. The full night of sleep is contingent on seeing that they got all the naptime hours of sleep they need. NOT THE CASE FOR MY HIGH-NEED CHILD! I didn't find this book helpful at all. I was very disappointed. If you're already doing a routine, don't even waste you money here!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"Our daughter was sleeping 7-8 hours at night, but it was the wrong 7-8 hours. Instead of going down at a reasonable 9 or even 10:00, she would keep us up until midnight or later. If we tried putting a drowsy baby in her crib she would instantly be wide awake the second we let go of her. I had been looking for a book that would help us get her down earlier. But this book, like Healthy Sleep Habits, just emphasizes ""finding the window"" to get her to sleep. If it was that simple I would not be reading these books. Initially this book appealed to me because she is against crying it out, but the solutions she provides are not what we needed. If you are a cosleeping breastfeeding mother (which I am not) these tips may be helpful. But if you are just trying to adjust your baby's sleep schedule or find solutions to get her to fall asleep, this book is not what you need. And who has the time or patience to fill out the forms and logs that she suggests?"
5,MIRACULOUS!!,"If you're trying to decide whether to let baby cry it out, I would definitely encourage you to try reading Elizabeth Pantley's book first!! My 7 month old son had not exactly been a champion of the snooze. The longest stretch he had clocked was 6 1/2 hrs, but the norm was nightly stretches ranging from 45 min. (even shorter at the beginning of the night) to maybe 4 1/2 hrs, if we were LUCKY. We had tried a very sad 22 minutes of Ferberization two weeks ago, and our son was so stressed out in his crib for the next week- he didn't want to play in there in the morning like he usually would, and he seemed very upset. Not for us- though I don't pass judgement on people for whom it works. However, if you're not convinced about the cry it out strategy, I think you owe it to your baby to at least give the no cry methods a college try first. After getting this book and starting to apply the strategies on Wed, our son slept for NINE HOURS AND 40 MINUTES on Friday night!! Amazing. Good luck."
3,"Great ideas, if implemented early","The suggestions in this book did not work for us. I think mostly because we started trying them in our baby at 7 months, do he could hold out waaaay longer than we could with the gentle methods. Perhaps if we had started when he was 2 or 3 months old, we would have been successful.Also, unless you have the patience of Job, this will only work with 2 parents tag-teaming. I gave up after trying to put my guy down barely asleep for a week without progress."
2,Didnt help me any,my son has never been a sleeper and i don't believe in the cry it out method so a friends friend recommended this book. it didn't give me any new information its basically about setting up a routine which he was already on im disappointed that i wasted time and money reading something that didn't help at all. The only thing i learned was to try to give a lovey but even that didn't work my son still doesn't sleep more then a few hours at a time :(
2,Not helpful,"Basically tells you to just wait it out and eventually your child will sleep. I wish it were helpful, but it really wasn't."
4,Great advice for better sleep,This book is perfect help for those parents that want better sleep but want to continue to co-sleep and breastfeed on demand. The author has excellent advice and its effective!
2,baby sleep,"I had my hopes set high before reading this book. Longing for answers as to how to get my 9 month old to sleep through the night. But in the end, this is another book that gives ideas, just like any parent would as to what worked for them. As well as and ""if all else fails"" suggestion to letting a child cry it out. I was left feeling disappointed but confirming in my mind and heart that not all babies are created equal. It is our job, as parents, to get to know our children. During the day and at night. We can encourage them in healthy sleep, but there are a variety of reasons why a child wakes. As long as they have a supportive parent there, then I'm thinking that child will get it eventually."
4,The No Cry Sleep Solution Review,"The No Cry Sleep Solution is a step by step, gentle process to helping your baby sleep better. I've been on the routine with my son for 3 weeks and I've had positive results. I use the book almost everyday for ideas and suggestions and inspiration to go on through the sleepless nights. My son doesn't sleep all night yet, but now at least I can see a light at the end of the tunnel."
5,This book works!,"With our first child we had issues with him sleeping all the way through the night. After reading this book and following its recommendations he slept all the way through and has never stopped. Hes is now 6 yrs old and never once gets up ever.Our daughter started out sleeping through the night at about 3 weeks old, so we never used this book to help us with her. Now, at age 4 she gets up every night at about 4am or earlier.What I am getting at is that if you can get them on a good pattern when they are infants it can help them with sleep throughout their whole lives. Which is why I recommend this book wholeheartedly for any new parents, or even if your on number 3 or 4...Highly recommended!Thanks for reading my review."
5,Gentle solutions for gentle parents,"I purchased this book after a recommendation from some friends. My daughter was waking every 2 hours at about 10 months of age, but I wasn't sure if it was due to hunger or some other issue. After reading this book, my husband and I were able to implement a gentle plan in order to determine what was waking my daughter, how to comfort her without making her dependent on another sleep association, and then getting her to sleep through the problem. It really only took a couple of weeks until our little girl was waking every 1.5-2 hours to sleeping 5 hours at a stretch! This may not seem like much to you, but this was a massive improvement for us, and now she sleeps 12 hours straight. She never had to Cry It Out or go through Controlled Crying. Gentle solutions for gentle parents. Thank you Elizabeth!"
5,Gentle guidance when none was to be found,"This book gave me hope that I COULD help my son sleep without prolonged periods of crying (or any crying at all!). It took our son only about a week to reduce his wakings from 4-5 to 2-3, and with the help of this book I transitioned him to his own crib a few weeks later. He now wakes 0-1 times! I could try to explain what we did, but reading the book will make more sense.I would set aside some time when you are somewhat rested to read this book. I was tired and desperate, making reading it more difficult- but it is such a relief to find out that there are gentle ways to increase baby's sleep."
2,Book didn't work for us,"We tried to follow this book but it didn't really work on our 11 months old. He has been falling asleep on the breast. I tried to do what the book says to phase it out. But he would cry immediately after I take him off the breast. He has figured out what was happening and pretty much cried like somebody was trying to murder him. No amount of holding him, rocking him, walking made any difference. Although the book tells you what to do in theory, it didn't work for us in reality. We are pretty much going to have to do the cry-it out method anyways. There are some small amount of useful information in the book so I'm going to rate it 2 stars. Maybe the method works on some babies but not ours, unfortunately."
1,"Nice idea, but didn't work for me!","I bought this book hoping I could teach my 9-month old daughter how to fall asleep on her own without crying. The ideas and advice in this book all sound good on paper, but when I actually tried to implement them into our nightly routine, I ended up more frustrated than ever before! It says you have to be patient, but I honestly think it would take forever for my baby to learn how to sleep this way! I've since purchased a different book, The Sleepeasy Solution, and I got a full night's sleep in 3 days! It's a less gentle, but more effective approach. My baby still cries (for less than 2 minutes) every night, but then sleeps 11 hours straight without waking up. I would say that the 2 minutes of crying is WELL WORTH IT if it means a better nights sleep for both me and the baby. She wakes up HAPPY every day and I no longer feel bad about letting her cry for a bit."
2,Does it really work?,"Although this book contains ideas that are helpful for the beginner--and quite obvious when it's your second, third, etc. time around--I am dubious as to whether Pantley's method actually WORKS. I say this because her method can take months to implement, and her strategy basically involves doing all the things you want to get away from doing in order for your child to get to sleep independently (rocking, holding, walking, etc. etc.) Therefore, who's to say that the baby actually LEARNED to sleep through the night, or merely grew out of night waking? This book could also possibly be accurately called Do Everything You Are Already Doing, Just Wait a Little Longer."
2,"Get Tizzy Hall's ""Save Our Sleep"" instead","I disliked the way this book was written very much - it's all over the place and the author seems to be terrified of giving advice in a confident way.In the end this book was just a drawn out, disorganised version of Tizzi Hall's book: ""Save Our Sleep"". That book quickly gives a specific way to fix sleep problems - that are pretty much the same as Pantley's anyway.I'm disappointed I bought this."
2,Not the results i was hoping for,"I purchased this book because of the good reviews, but unfortunately after following the book for over 2 months now we still haven't had any success.Our 8 month old still wakes up about every 2 hours. And i get the feeling that the more i go in to try to comfort her and respond to her at night the worse it gets. I might consider trying to let her cry since the Pantley method seems to be not working for us. And we just have to do something since we are totally sleep deprived.But i would never say this book was no help at all. I definatley think that there are babies out there who respond probably better to the Pantley method than our daughter."
3,definitely avoid CIO (crying it out),"I was so sleep deprived I barely got through this book- but it was a little bit helpful. The sceduling and writing stuff out is just too much when you can't even remember your own name. I now tell all my friends that when baby is 6-8 mos old or so, I'll come over and help them learn to put baby to sleep without weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. You don't need a complicated schedule keeping, you just need a couple weeks in a row to implement my sleep plan- it's simple, effective, and has lasted us since my son was 17 mos old (he's almost 6 now). EMAIL ME IF YOU NEED HELP! I've decided to call myself the ""Sleepytime Fairy"", lol!"
5,Sent from above,"When I found this book my 9 month old was waking up every 90 minutes all night long, and taking several cat naps a day. Sleep deprived can't begin to describe the desperation I was feeling. And yet I refused to abandon my baby to cry it out alone. This book was truly and answer to a prayer. It gives simple, and practical solutions in a format that is easy to read no matter how little sleep you're getting. Elizabeth Pantley's strategies are a wonderful and loving alternative to the host of ""Cry it out"" advice you've received and rejected. The key for me was patience and persistence. This is not an immediate fix, but a light at the end of the tunnel."
1,Who's got the time for this?.,"This book is too long. As a new mom, I just don't have that kind of time. For a shorter, easier solution, read ""50 Easy Ways to Get Your Child to Sleep"" by Dana Kenny."
2,"Some helpful tips, but also WAY too judgemental","This book reads like an obsessed mother's diary. It has some helpful tips about setting up a bedtime routine, but there's a ton of unsupported conjecture that passes judgment on anyone who lets their baby cry.The author writes as if she knows that when your baby cries and you don't immediately go to his side that he feels abandoned and terrified. How, exactly, does she know that?!? That's a ridiculous statement not supported by any science, and it's an irresponsible way to scare new parents."
2,I expected more,"I have been reading Dr. Sears' books for the past 12 years. In fact, I've raised my kids by them. I expected more from a sleep book he chose to endorse. Disappointing."
2,Get from the library,"From the title, I thought this book would help me with my baby's biggest sleep problem - crying within 3-4 minutes of being put down to sleep, whether she is still awake when laid down or in a deep sleep. But ""crying"" is not even in the index! Although this book has some good ideas and is easy to read, the author seems to assume that your baby does not cry when set down and/or falls asleep easily and is primarily a guide to pre-sleep soothing techniques. However, her parenting philosophy is a nice counterbalance to other sleep authors who are more critical of attachment parenting."
2,Buy a toy with the money instead,"I don't think you should buy any more books of this kind. Babies are babies. You should enjoy them while you can and not train them into something else to fit your life. After I read this book, all I can think of was 'how long did she sleep?', 'I am supposed to pull off the nipple now..' or 'how many times did she wake up?' I think it is more stressful to keep track of my baby's sleeping pattern than to actually waking up and feeding at night. I regret buying this book and I wish I can return it.After I tossed out all the ideas from this book and just be a mom, I felt much better. I was at peace of my baby. And I think that's the key thing to every parent. I mean if your baby is having fun and night waking is not a desparate situation for you. Just enjoy yourselves and in time, your baby will sleep better."
3,Useless advice unless you and baby co-sleep,"Pantley's suggestions were useless. If anything, this book taught me that there is no effective ""no cry"" solution. After reading her book, I opted to Ferberize."
4,What No One Taught Me,"This book is wonderful and written by a real mom. It taught me a lot of things that we simply didn't know as a first-time parents who have had next to no experience with babies and children. We were letting our son go to sleep when he had his nighly meltdown at 11:15pm by putting him in the swing and then moving him after he fell asleep. The book most importantly taught me about bedtime routines and how putting infants to bed early helps them sleep longer. In less than a week he slept 10 hours straight, 8pm to 6am. It's not like this every night, he's not perfect- but oh how things have changed. The sleep logs were helpful just to have a sense of how much sleep he is getting versus how much sleep he should be getting. Now I just need a book on how to make myself go to bed early enough so I get enough sleep."
5,A gentle method that works,"The tone of this book is friendly and reassuring, but the method is organized and efficient. The first part explains how babies sleep so that you can understand WHY your baby wakes up. The second part is a long list of solutions that are categorized by need: newborn, frequent nursing baby, co-sleeper, bottle baby, pacifier user, older baby, non-napper, etc. You read through all the ideas and select the ones that make sense for your baby. Then the book has forms to help you create a plan. I usually don't do this kind of thing, but having it all written out gave me confidence and patience to follow my plan. There's even a chapter on how to analyze your success - or lack of it - so that you can make changes until you and your baby are both sleeping. Plus a bonus chapter on adult sleep. All the ideas are creative and gentle and logical. I highly recommend this book if you have any sleep issues with your baby."
2,No new information,"I didn't really find this book to be all that helpful. First of all, I found the suggestion of holding your baby's mouth shut to keep him from rooting for your nipple utterly laughable. Secondly, the other suggestions in the book were no different than any others that I've heard. You can get them from any sleep book, some of which are much less expensive. I also felt that this book was geared towards those who co-sleep. There was advice from those who don't co-sleep, but most of the testamonials were from those who do. There was some useful information, but definately not a sleep solution breakthrough."
2,"Nice idea, but no cigar.","Pantley has collected a variety of nice ideas to try, but if your baby has deep-rooted sleep associations, don't waste precious time here. This book is not for babies who are ""problem sleepers"". For that, stick with the Feberber Method. It's tough, but if you stick with it and stay consistent, you'll see results. It worked wonders for us!"
1,Didnt work at all for us :-(,"I feel i did everything properly in this book, i observed my son for two days kept the proper logs for naps, bedtime routine and bedtime and i went through all the nessecary steps for 4 weeks with absolutely NO CHANGE in my sons sleeping habits so i finally tossed this method into the pile of all others that didnt work....very unfortunate for us, though i have a VERY stubborn son, i have no doubt these methods could work wonders for others...just not for us."
5,A Gentle Method,"I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate the advice Elizabeth Pantley gives in her book, The No Cry Sleep Solution. I wanted some advice on helping my son sleep better at night that didn't involve harsh and detrimental ""crying it out"" methods. I want my son to have a happy, healthy attitude about bedtime and sleeping. He is now easy to put to bed at night and enjoys his naps during the day. The chapter on night weaning was especially helpful for me, I didn't completely night wean, but had an older baby that was a frequent night-time nurser. Her night-time weaning methods helped me gently reduce those feedings to once a night and we were soon sleeping sounder and for longer stretches. I have recommended this book and The No Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers to many, many friends!"
5,Schedule required,I really loved the book and all of it's ideas. We really try to use them. I strongly feel that a baby should not have to cry himself to sleep in order for everyone to get some rest and the author helped me feel like someone was on my side. I'm tired of everyone pressuring us into letting our baby cry it out.We are not a very structured family as we travel a lot and have inconsistent schedules. This made it hard to keep good logs and follow through.I would recommend it to anyone that is trying to get some rest and does not want their baby to cry.
3,Like the idea...,"I like the idea of this book, for my own sanity sake since my baby crying really raises my blood pressure. I bought this when I was severely sleep deprived and my pediatrician was encouraging me to try the Ferber method.At 3 1/2 mos old I thought she was too young for that and searched for this book. I did what it suggested and watched for my baby's sleep pattern. What I noticed it that as they get older they will naturally start to fall into their own pattern. At 7 mos old I decided to start letting her cry more, or rather ""fuss it out"". I find that she is now crying less and sleeping longer and more soundly and much happier when she is awake. Last night she slept from 6:30pm to 5am! And went back to sleep for her morning nap at 8am (and she has been asleep for over 1 1/2 hrs now)!I am happy to report I am no longer sleep deprived and am able to handle her crying episodes and understand, that all babies cry... even a little."
1,Wasn't worth the effort.,"I would not recommened this book. I purchased it when my 5 month old daughter was still waking 7-8 times a night. I faithfully followed the advice outlined in the book, sleep logs and all, but I did not see any real progress. After a month of trying, and a lot of exhaustion, I took a friend's advice and read Jodi Mindell's book sleeping through the night. That book was a godsend. In 5 nights my daughter was sleeping all night long. Literally from 7pm-8am. That was seven years ago. In retrospect, I wish I had just gone straight to Mindell's book, but, you live and you learn.Sleeping Through the Night, Revised Edition: How Infants, Toddlers, and Their Parents Can Get a Good Night's Sleep"
5,Gentle way to help your child sleep!,I am a family physican and I recently had a baby. I have spent many hours reading childcare and sleep books and studies. The No Cry Sleep Solution techniques work! And they are gentle! It is important to realize that these techniques take some experimenation and patience. I believe that these techniques accomplish what parents want for their children- close bonded relationships while still getting good sleep. I recommend this book to many of my patients!
5,Love it!,"What this book has done for me is immeasurable and I thank the author sincerely from my heart for advocating for mothers and babies everywhere. My bubba still wakes a lot at 12 months of age (combination of reflux, teething and hunger), but I am now confident enough to follow his cues and provide what he needs. I honestly wouldn't have been able to say that had I not read this book 8 months ago and felt the support through those pages. There was (and still is) so much pressure on me to have a complying baby, which I believe made my PND worse and delayed my ability to bond with my baby when he was born. I am pleased to say after the initial bumpy period, my son and I now have an incredibly close relationship and a mutual trust that is worth the short-term lack of sleep. So thank you again Elizabeth (and again and again)!"
5,Answers and a hand to hold,Everyone was telling me that I created my baby's sleep problems and that I should put her in a crib and allow her to cry to sleep. Even if it was my fault she was awake every hour I could never let her cry like that. I am so thankful I found this book. Not only does it have an endless supply of ideas sorted by age and type (such as for cosleeping or crib sleeping) it is so warm and friendly to read. Pantley keeps reassuring you that everything will be fine and that in the long run you'll be proud you didn't cave in to letting your baby cry. I very highly recommend this lovely book.
2,Common Sense,"This book was an OK read. If you have the common sense of how to put a baby to bed, it really won't help you. It did have a few good ideas example: Give the child a lovee, like a lamb or music maker to sleep with everynight and the child will become more relaxed and dependant on it instead of you when he/she wakes in the night. That's about it, the rest was common sense things like give him a passy, rock him , feed him etc."
3,Some good ideas but not great for daycare babies,"This book has some great ideas for how to gently help your child sleep, but most solutions require you to be with your baby...and for working mom's who's kids sleep issues may be compounded by crappy naps at daycare - the solutions aren't helpful there. It's also VERY strongly AGAINST cry it out. If you're still on the fence about what solution to try, know that this book will have you petrified to try CIO."
2,"For us, useless and guilt-inducing","I read the preceding printing of this book in 2003. The book is loaded with suggestions for encouraging babies to fall asleep on their own, nap longer, etc. Maybe something in it will work for you. But for me it was useless--perhaps worse than useless. After I read this, my 6-month-old woke up more often and resisted sleep more strenuously than before I started applying Pantley's tips to encourage him to sleep through the night. (Maybe he guessed that I was trying to pull something over on him.) If her plans don't work for you, Elizabeth Pantley concludes that you're not following them with enough discipline. While her suggestions seem common-sensical enough, executing her techniques can be involved. The whole exercise starts to feel like a convoluted magic trick, where the magic never works but because the steps are so tricky, you can never be sure that the fault doesn't lie with you. Who knows, maybe you didn't include quite enough claw of toad?"
3,Not the most realistic.,"I was hopeful that this approach was going to work for our little one. She had colic for the first 3.5 months and cried a lot. Therefore i was looking for a sleep approach that didn't require additional crying. We didn't start any real sleep ""training"" until 4 months. And bottomline... we have come to the conclusion, some crying must occur. I know that ALL babies are different, but this approach was not the one for us."
5,A Working Mom's helper,"As a working Mom of two this book was a great help to me! My first child was not always the best sleeper and after a year of going to work surviving with my IV of coffee in the morning, my sister gave me this book. Before getting this book, we did try to let my daughter ""cry it out"", only to watch her throw up in her crib from being so upset- I knew that wasn't an option ever again!! This book works- thanks sis!Mommy's High Heel Shoes"
4,Gentle and Kind,"This book has a lot of great ideas to help your baby into sleeping on their own, without the awful cry it out method.Gentle and kind for our little loved ones. If you have a colicky baby find out the source of their pain before trying a sleep solution.Stacey"
2,"Overall, not very helpful","I learned a few tips on how to get my child down at night, however, with my husband watching our child in the day and me at night, we could not get a system down that would work. Her naps have never been good and she refuses the bottle in favor of the breast, so she does most of her eating at night. As she has gotten older, it has just gotten worse. I have given up on this method."
5,nurturing peaceful sleep that helps meet both mom's and baby's needs,"I wish so much a gentle book like this would have been available when my firstborn was a baby; it would have helped us avoid many tears -- mine and my baby's! We struggled so much with her sleep habits, and I even, against my mothering intuition, regretfully left her to cry to sleep alone. I am so relieved and thankful for this book that shares gentle, loving, practical advice and alternatives to leaving our little ones alone to cry. These ideas help parents to be able to meet their little one's needs, as well as their own. A very balanced and attachment-promoting book."
3,"Sounds nice, but not for me","Although I found some of the techniques in this book usefull, overall it was not practical for my family. I have 2 daughters now 4 and 17 months. Both had difficulty sleeping through the night their first year. In the end we used Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth with a lot of sucess. The approach sounds more harsh, but was effective in just a few days and resulted in a very happy baby with a much better sleep routine. Which of course makes for happier and better parents too."
2,The No-Sleep Cry Solution,"Thats what my husband started calling it. I was a dedicated follower of attachment parenting from the birth of my baby until she was 6 months. When my baby was five months old, someone at an attachment parenting meeting recommended this book. After following Pantley's method for one month, my baby was sleeping for 30 minute stretches and waking up screaming. This just didn't work for us.Also, it's badly written and has that opening chapter of emotion guilt-garbage. How can you subject a sleep deprived parent to pages of circular and self-referencial emotional arguments? Now that's cruelty.I do feel that the emphesis on scheduling might be enough to help a great number of people. It's no miracle, however.Do what works for you, what feels right. Integrate different wisdom for many sources. And don't be afraid to change your parenting style mid-stream."
2,Didn't work,"The idea is theoretically great: get your baby to sleep without tears. But it didn't work for us. My baby simply refused to sleep on her own. Pantley recommends putting baby in her crib when she is almost asleep, but our baby just woke up screaming when we did that, everytime. If not, she would wake and refuse to go back to sleep, unless she was held. Maybe our baby is a high-need baby, in which case perhaps this doesn't work for high-need babies."
2,Didn't work for us,"I read this book (it was the first book I'd bought on infant sleep problems) and tried it out wholeheartedly for about 3 months before I realized it just wasn't for us. Our baby was extremely stubborn and we ended up using a gentle method of the ""cry it out"" and it worked charms for us. Once she figured out how to fall asleep on her own, that was all it took. So, after 3 months of failing with this book, it only took a few hours of crying to work for us. Too bad I wasted 3 months in my mind. The book might work for you, but good luck!"
3,helpful but no panacea,"We have made some progress using ideas from this book in getting our baby (now 6 months) to sleep in her crib, but it has been very difficult and she still wakes frequently and requires our attention during the night."
1,Common sense and any other sleep book will help you more,"We have had significant sleep issues with our baby. I have read a few books by now and this one was really not worth the money to me. It is a mix of common sense and partly some very odd theories that seem way too self made. No scientific research is quoted to support this method. I bought this book because it was recommended by Dr Sears and I really like The Baby Book. It is hard to find a 'method' that will match all babies. I would recommend the Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child book. It has been of the most use to us."
2,Most useless sleep book ever,"This book fails to provide real solutions and actually suggests some of the things other books (and most parents) are trying to overcome - using a pacifier, rocking, nursing to sleep, etc. The book simply suggests doing these things for a shorter length of time each night, or just until the baby is groggy. That's really the gist of the entire book. A lot devoted to cosleeping and transition to crib, which was not useful to me because I do not do. Not enough devoted to naps. I give 2 stars only because it did provide a few useful suggestions on nursing and overcoming baby's falling asleep at the breast."
3,Less than what I had expected,"This book has certainly been brilliantly marketed, but the quality of the book really doesn't warrant the amount of attention that has been lavished on it. Yes, the author has some very sensible things to say about babies and sleep, but it's not anything different from what any good sleep chapter in any baby book would have to say on the subject. (In fact, the AAP baby book has much more solid advice and a lot less fluff, in my opinion.) If you read the excerpts, you'll see what I mean: lots of fluff, not a lot of substance."
2,Not the best bet for Canadian parents,"I agree with what a previous reviewer said. This book is not the best option for Canadian parents. Pantley doesn't make any mention at all of the Canadian Paediatric Society's recommendations about infants and sleep, nor does she reference other Canadian health authorities like Health Canada. She also fails to mention the top-notch sleep disorders clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto or to talk about the work of leading Canadian experts on babies and sleep. Most Canadian parents would find Bonny Reichert's book In Search of Sleep to be a lot more useful and relevant."
1,nothing new,"I was absolutly disappointed with this book. What annoyed me most was the repeated ""if you read this book then..."" Besides that there was nothing really new in that book and I find it strange that the author gives advice like: take away your nipple again and again if you do not want your baby to fall asleep on the breast. Excuse me, but what else would you do? To present that as a big new way of not letting your baby cry means to assume that every other mother is really stupid. Sorry, there are a few nice ideas, but I think you could put them on a maximum of 10 pages, the rest is just cheating you out of your money.I do not let my baby cry and this book defnitly did not help make my nights more quiet."
2,Lots of props & gimmicks,"It's a promising title & adorable cover, but that's it. All the cute names, the loveys, the anecdotes, and the strange methods the author suggests are tedious, obvious, or just extraneous. She suggests bizarre things like removing the breast from the baby & then counting -- incredibly tedious & a little sinister sounding.And it's all based on her own limited personal experience. We've had much better luck reading Weissbluth for the hard facts, & creating our own no-cry solution w/out all the props & gimmicks."
2,Not for everyone,"I'm a new mom and at about the 6th month my daughter started waking up a lot throughout the night and napping poorly during the day. I couldn't bare to hear you cry, so after much research I thought and hoped that this method would work for us. I followed the steps and tried every tip in this book with hopes that eventually it would work for us. I'm sorry to say it did not. My daughter was just stubborn. The only thing I did did work, was introducing a lovey (baby loves that). At about 9 months of nothing else working, I finally used the Ferber method and worked wonderfully for us. Baby learned to sleep on her own in 3 nights, and much to my surprise and delight, there wasn't a lot of crying, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place. She's been sleeping a solid 10-12hrs per night with almost no night wakings, and her naps are also great. So although this no-cry method might work for some, it didn't for us, my baby was just different."
4,Really great advice...kind of dry!,This book has lots of great advice and it REALLY works. It is really dry though. It also takes awhile to get to the point! It goes over sleep cycles and types of sleep and eventually how to help your child sleep all night. All in all it's a great book.
5,This book saved my sanity!!,"When my daughter wouldn't sleep, I knew there had to be another way than locking her in her crib & letting her cry. I just couldn't do that. Thankfully a friend recommended this book & it has literally saved my sanity. My daughter sleeps better, sleeps through the night, goes to bed eagerly (all things I thought would never happen) & we have a lovely time doing it - established rituals - no crying it out!"
4,Didn't use it,"This is a great book if you're willing to put in the leg work. I was not. We bed share and I nurse on demand, my baby just was no hard wired to sleep for long periods of time and I was not willing to alter that. But if you're at the end of your rope this may be the best!! Crying it out Is absurd and really unfair to your baby, so if longer periods of sleep is something you need to function this book is totally worth it!! Now that I've read it I will try a few differs things with our next child from the start."
4,my thoughts,"Very easy to read. Its difficult for me to make some of the adjustments she talks about but its a process. I never realized just how important naps were. Love that she has a table with recommended times for sleep based on child's age. Worth giving it a shot if ""crying it out"" is not for you."
4,self soothe,"I have read this book twice. At first I admit it sounded so hard to follow the bedtime log considering that I am a single mom. I tried every step in this book but last night I was too exhausted to continue. I usually have a set routine as in the book first a bath, then a massage, her formula and off to rock to sleep. I was creating a problem by rocking her to sleep, which is good however if you have to do it every single night for the baby to sleep then it is a problem. It is important to emphasize that your baby needs to learn how to self soothe themselves to sleep and then you can begin all Pantley's steps. I didn't realize because I was so sleep deprived that I had the best intentions for my baby but I was adding to the problem. Good luck."
2,"did not work, made my baby dependant on me to get him to sleep","At first i loved the book because it sounded like the answer to my prayers. My baby would start sleeping and he wouldn't ever have to cry! I gave it a good try for about 2 months or more and my baby ended up being dependent on me to get him to sleep and needed me to put him back to sleep every time he woke up in his sleep cycle. He and i, even more, never got enough sleep. i followed all the tips and its just didnt work. i tried the ferber method and he slept 12 hours within 4 days."
2,Didn't work for me,"Sadly, I wanted this approach to work but it was more frustrating then helpful. I was turned off as soon as I read the section where the author encouraged mothers to hold their baby's mouth shut after breast feeding to stop them from wanting to suckle more. Not my idea of a gentle approach."
2,Would have loved for this to work for us,"I have twin boys and I would have loved not to have to go the cry route. I bought this book with that thought in mind - no crying. I swore up and down I would NEVER let them CIO. I tried to follow the book but with 2 babies - it didn't always work for us and actually my sons began to wake up even more often after trying to follow this plan.After much soul searching I decided to try one of the ""other"" methods and I now have 2 sleepers.I think that if you can take the time - weeks to get this in place - it is a great idea - our sleep deprivation was too severe by the time I got this book."
5,Sanity for Sleepy Moms!,"The No-Cry Sleep Solution is a must read for every parent struggling with sleep issues! Elizabeth Pantley's wonderful ideas and recommendations will guide parents to find gentle, helpful ways to ease their children into sleep without crying and stress. Her book offers recommendations for whatever your sleep choices - co-sleeping or crib sleeping, bottle feeding or breastfeeding - and thus offers solutions across the parenting spectrum! Comforting for any parent who feels they have the only child who doesn't sleep ""through the night""!"
2,too bad it didn't work,"I think this book is wonderful philosophically, and I believe that her method has helped people, and it did not work for us. After trying for 3 months, I finally had to admit that my baby's sleep had not improved. I wrote this review because I want other parents to be willing to stop trying after a point if it does not work. The book is so incredibly well-regarded right now that I think it is hard to finally say ""It doesn't work for us!"". But it didn't."
2,What About Working Mothers?,"After 7 months of not sleeping through the night, I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I read The No-Cry Sleep Soluition and tried to follow the new bedtime plan. The problem is that a major part of the plan is the daytime schedule. As much as I would love to be home with my child all day to get her nap routine and early bedtime in place, I CAN'T! My daycare tries the best they can, but if she doesn't stick to the schedule they don't force it. And since we don't get home until 6:30 pm every night, a bedtime before 8:00 pm is out of the question.Elizabeth Pantley's ideas sound great, but they don't work for parents who have to work full time."
3,"I'm low on sleep, GET TO THE POINT ALREADY!","I got this book hoping to solve some sleep issues & quick. However, I found myself reading on & on about why I should use this method. I felt like she was trying to be salesman for her book. HELLO! I've already bought your book & want to get to the point so I can start getting some sleep. The method may work but I'm short on time & can only read a little bit everytime so the mumbling on & on about why the cry-it-out method is so bad & here's what mom's say about my method & blah, blah, blah is unnecessary. I've finally skipped all that (only to find there's more scattered about, arrrg) and am now trying to practice some of her tips."
3,"Some good ideas, overall too complicated and hard","This book has some good pointers about babies and sleep including a graph of how much your baby should be sleeping. However, the plan is way way way too complicated to implement and the author considers success to be a baby sleeping 5 hours at night. I like her compassionate thoughts towards babies, but they just were totally impractical for me with twins. I finally let my twins cry it out. It worked in one night -- unlike this book's 10 night plan which you have to do over and over until it works according to the book."
3,Its ok but don't expect any miracles,"Why do you think there are so many used copies for sale?Has some helpful suggestions though and stresses the importance of a bedtime routine. It involves doing lots of sleep logs which just remind you of how much sleep you're NOT getting. And its frustrating when there's no improvement after weeks. Her techniques are very gentle and as she stresses, changes happen over time. And if you have a baby who doesn't sleep well, chances are you are already doing most of her common sense techniques."
3,good ideas but,There are a lot of good ideas but you can get a lot of them from the author's website.
4,Good grief they're talking about my baby!,"Well, there's a good chance that you can find portions that relate to your baby too. I'm actually reading this book at the 4 month point... almost 2 months after I started to systematically and logically come to many of the same conclusions as this author (and of course borrowing ideas from other books that I've read). I'm not sure if I would have understood her many practical points just by reading them but they are certainly dead on when compared with my months of studious logging, suspicions, and experiments. Unless you have the time to hide out in a cabin with your baby and spouse for almost two months as I did, you may never be sufficiently isolated from social commitments to see the patterns that the author describes succinctly. With the holidays upon us and the baby's needs evolving, this book is a good source of reminders on how to stay focused on the baby and her needs -- which will in turn keep the whole family happy!"
2,"Great idea, but did not work for us","Did not work for my baby. My baby has woken up every 1 1/2 to 2 hours since birth(he's now 7 months old!) and I have tried everything except letting him cry it out for longer then 10 min at a time. I got this book a couple months ago w/ high hopes but to no avail. My baby does not go back to sleep w/ out breastfeeding which I am tryign to work on and gets very very upset and wakes himself up when I try to insert my finger to remove him as stated in the book. Even w/ repeat times of doign this it didn't work. I tried everythign mentioned and already had been trying the majority of it for some time before getting thsi book. Sorry to say this does nto work for my baby. I need to resort to the dreaded cry it out method clearly, but w/ compassion."
3,"Good ideas, but no plan","I liked the book for all of the ideas it had to help your baby fall asleep with no crying, however, it was difficult to figure out what to do for my child. It was overwhelming to have to decide which particular idea would work and how long would I need to do trial and error in order to figure out what would work best. I would recommend this book for someone who has a new baby or a baby on the way, but if you are already sleep deprived and want help sooner than later, this isn't the book for you."
1,Absolutely worthles,"My 4 month old refuses to sleep. He sleeps about 5 hours a day (3 hours at night and then 10 minute catnaps). This book was worthless. It didn't suggest anything I hadn't already tried! Also, I kept waiting for the kicker....what would definitely put my baby to sleep. I'm sorry to say that I never did find an absolute answer. Too bad my baby can't read....this book might put him to sleep."
2,Just because it worked with your baby,"I had my first baby seven months ago. Before and after I had him I have read a bunch of books about ""techniques"" that will help your baby sleep. I think that people should stop writing books because they were able to put their babies to sleep. Because it worked for you and a few other people, does not mean it can work for everyone! Authors should stop generalizing! The authors talks about ""her research"" but she never explained what her research consisted of, what articles/books she read, did she consult with experts? She only reference 1 or 2 books. She is a Dr. Sears' fan so if you do not agree with his techniques this book is not for you. The book was a waste of time."
2,Too complicated,"I think this book may work for those who are really against letting their babies cry, but I have to say, if you are truly sleep deprived, trying to remember all of the things you're supposed to do at 2 am (and 3 am, 4 am, etc.) is nearly impossible. When I would wake up in the wee hours with my son, I couldn't remember all of the methods she described, and it wasn't like I could read the book right then! If you are really committed to this type of method, I would think it would work pretty well, but in my completely exhausted state, trying to remember several different steps to help my baby back to sleep made me more frustrated."
3,"Nice thought, not universally applicable","The recommendations in this book are wonderful for parents whose children respond as she predicts. Unfortunately, not all children respond to soothing the same way. Maybe I was too sleep deprived to understand, but when I couldn't get my daughter to sleep without crying even in my arms or at my breast, I didn't know where to go from there.I ended up using Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child to figure out my daughter's (and now my son's) sleep needs - it has a ton of actual information on how much sleep children tend to need at any giving age as well as how to get your child the sleep he or she needs, such as limiting the time of wakeful periods and watching for early sleep signs. Graphs, lots of examples from real parents, and the ""action plan for exhausted parents"" at the end of each chapter were extremely helpful."
1,useless book - good title,"this book has a title that appeals to the heart of every parent, particularly new one and this is the only reason it gets sold. There is no valuable information in that book other that what is compiled from other books by prominent pediatricians. If you want to help your baby sleep, read Dr. Wisebluth book ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"""
1,RIDICULOUS,"I just couldn't finish reading the book that's how hilarious it got. So, if you are on the look out for that kind of a genre, then here you go, you can have it for only 10 bucks.What I really hate in all baby books is when they try to make a general rule for all babies and they really believe that that method will work for all babies.BABIES ARE DIFFERENT!!!To write in a book that that sleeping method is a guarantee for the baby to sleep, then that's something wrong with the author!!! It could work but a GUARANTEE!!! Jeez!!! No way!!!I didn't find it helpful in any way."
1,"Nice idea, didn't work for us.","I just want to add my 2 cents here. This method only made my baby more upset. CIO folks, it's the only way to go. We did CIO at 5 months and our entire family is happier because of it. Good luck!"
2,Strategies May Cause More Crying,"I think that Pantley's advice has a major flaw. When she outlines her steps to getting a child to sleep, she says that if the child won't fall asleep using her strategy and you are getting frustrated, just to go back to what you were doing before. By doing this you are only teaching your child that all they need to do is cry and get picked up and put down for a long time and eventually you will do what you have always done to get them to sleep (which wasn't working for you if you are trying this new method). Of course you don't want your child to cry himself to sleep, but you also don't want to cry yourself to sleep either. Your baby needs a well-rested and sane mother most of all. Whatever method you use to get your child to sleep, you must be consistent and this book does not embrace that and encourages you to backtrack."
1,A zero!,This book was a useless waste of money. Not only is my kid sleeping less... Now I'm wasting money filling out stupid charts. I can't imagine this working for any baby. And yes... I read the book 3 times. I wish I could get my money back.
1,A way to prolong your grief,My wife and I tried this method for two months w/ our 10-12 month old and did not get much success and a continued great lack of sleep.Basically this book does nothing to not be dependent on you to fall asleep.We finally switch to a variant of the cry it out method as detailed in (Solve your Child's Sleep problems) and in 3 days our daughter (and ourselves) are sleeping much better. Wish we had done the other method much earlier.
2,not that helpful,"Though this book is thoughtfully written and contains some nice ideas (early bedtime, lovey), the methods it suggests have not made much difference at all with my son's sleep habits. pantley's method for helping babies nap longer does not work with babies who wake up suddenly and completely. also, it seems silly to say that almost all babies should be taking long naps. the gentle removal method has made no difference in the amount of time my son sleeps and is starting to feel like a lot of work for nothing. after following this method for about one month, things are the same as when we started. maybe it is helpful for babies who wake up very frequently, but with our son who wakes 2-3 times in 13 hours it has made no difference."
5,Helped a lot with little effort,"So far we've only tried lengthening our ""naps"" which were 1/2 long on the dot every time... It's taken over a month of trying, but now we have some naps that are almost two hours long. Still trying to get around to working on the rest of our routine."
2,Pantley's removal method turned my son into a BITER!,"Pros-This book was easy to read and relate to.-May introduce some new ideas-May be a good book to read before you start reading Ferber.-Better reference for Nursing moms.Cons- Most things discussed in this book most people already know.- Her gental removal plan turned my great nurser into a biter. He would start to dose and I would remove the nipple. After a few times he would jerk himself awake and bite down because he was affraid I would take it away!- Doesn't really go into changes in schedules and traveling that well.Overall the one thing I did get from this book, was to improve his naps and this would improve his night time sleep. I ended up doing a more gentle Cry it out method and it has turned my 8 time-a-night waker into 1 time and with only 15 mins of crying MAX."
3,Good ideas but I didn't bother,"Pantley offers great, AP friendly ideas for helping your child sleep -- even if that child is in the bed with you -- without nursing throughout the night. I still have a hard time depriving my baby if she's hungry. Early in the book, Pantley writes that if you're OK with your sleep situtation, that you don't need her solutions. I decided I can live with our situation a bit longer. It's easier to nurse and fall back to sleep. :-)"
3,Common sense,"Most of the ideas in here were obvious, common sense things. I suppose if you are a young, first time mother this might be helpful. There were a couple of things that helped, but overall nothing I hadn't heard before."
3,Pick and choose what works,"I found this book to be somewhat helpful in terms of developing strategies to help my baby sleep better. It helped me get a clearer idea of what is normal for each developmental stage. However, I didn't find a lot of new ideas, and I ended up reading a few other books on infant sleep that were much more helpful, specifically, ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" by Dr. Marc Weissbluth. This book is specifically designed with those who practice ""attachment parenting"" in mind, so if you are not 100% sold on that concept you will probably just need to pick and choose the ideas you like from the book."
4,Works for some,"IT HELPED me get him to sleep through the night, but not fully. some kids do great with it and some dont. I'd say if you are desperate to sleep through the night, buy this book, (used copy) and try it, it might work, it might not....."
5,A Superflous Book,"A Superflous BookA delight to read! The author seductively captures the essence of self-development, self-discovery, self-awareness, self-serenity. While the book is comprised of a collection of essays, the essays flow together to give the book a sense of unity. Yet, each essay may be read in insolation to give each its own independent identity, but without sacrificing the book's flavor. I've read it once, i've read it twice, but three times would be a charm. Congratulations to the superflous author."
5,An excellent alternative,"Dr. Weinzimmer provides an excellent alternative to the common views on strategic management. I was a student in his strategic management course during my undergraduate study, and we used this book. Comparing it to other strategy classes, I can honestly say his view comes out on top. I would recommend this to any college student looking for an alternative to what is commonly included in books."
5,Luther Allison Lives On!!!!!!!!!,"I was very fortunate to see Luther Allison twice before he passed on. He was an excellant guitarist,probably the most underrated blues singer other than Freddie King and a superb entertainer. When he talked to you whether singing or between songs you really felt like he was talking to you. This show was done in the Indian Ocean and is an exceptional piece of work. What is also so beautiful is that someone actually had the foresight to record this. Luther is just cooking along doing his thing whether it be playing those great Gibson guitars or singing in his soulful blues voice. ""Just as I Am"" and ""There Comes a Time"" are the highlights as they show a little more of the man that Luther had become. Excellant sound for your DVD stereo sytem at home also. No disappointments here!!!!!!!!"
3,Not that good,"This is more of an educational video - and not so much an edutainment video. It pales in comparison to Magic School Bus and Crash! Bang! Splat! on the Discovery Kids network.I suppose if they used it in school it would be okay. It is 90% education and 10% entertainment. I guess it is meant to inform, and not so much to entertain. The animation is a little second rate. I am still trying to get my daughter to watch it."
2,More info,"I bought this hoping it would be broken into individual sections I could use to begin my science lessons. It will serve better as a review for all the systems before the test. Not as in depth, or broken up as I was hoping."
3,A Frustrating Disappointment,"Having a Denon Receiver, I know first hand the quality of Denon Products. This player lives up to that rep so long as you feed it factory disks. On home recorded movies, it won't reliably read +R DL. Several brands of discs were tried and none of them played 100% of the time. Don't hesitate to buy Denon, it is a great product. However, if you use +R DL discs you might want to consider another player."
3,Temerature range is too limited.,"The thermometer works fine, but I didn't notice before I bought itthat it only reads from 200-400 degrees. This means it is notsuitable for things like fudge, which must be cooled to 110 degrees.If you want to make candy, buy a thermometer that starts at 100degrees."
4,What not to miss in NO.,"A great little book, worthwhile if you're going to New Orleans - this was our second time there and the book brought to light things we'd not seen or done before.However, I odn't always agree with what I read and after having been there before, some of things that the authored raved about - I really have to disagree with.Our first visit was like a kid in the candy store - wide eyed, excited but our 2nd trip to NO wasn't anything like that - it was more oh, ok - well, I see. - not impressed with the folks, customer service - not the friendly, outgoing people we'd seen on our fist trip.Despite all the bad, I'd say go ahead and buy this book if not for the information of where and what you might want to see, but also for the history of N.O."
3,A fast but not really filling read.,"Richard B Russell Democrat from Winder Georgia, was an extremely skilled parlimentarian and executive. However he was easy prey for Lyndon Johnson who gave him the shad treatment. In looking at this man's life he accomplished many things but in the end was lacking in 3 things. The courage to step up and lead the Senate and bend it to his will on agricultural and defense issues and an inability to see beyond his roots and their limiting factors he could of broken the mold and become President if he realized that geography and socioeconomic factors would inflict a defacto segragation on America and that once they were done with the Civil rights struggle the north would lose much of it's passion for social reform and change and the nation would be generally like it always was with blacks in the end vanishing into the mostly white Hispanic race. The third thing that I found him lacking in was honor he was but a Lyndon Johnson stepping stone and no Samuel T Rayburn."
2,"Pfaltzgraff Tandem 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4","We bought three sets in order to have service for 12. We are very pleased with the product, and recent guests complimented us on this.Sadly, over time as we used this product, it has become clear that the items were poorly glazed. They show every knife scratch, They look like an hockey rink before the Zamboni ice machine has resurfaced it,"
1,Very low production value,"I was very disappointed in this dvd. Despite having been recently released, it is basically someone's narrated vacation video from the 1980s (judging by the clothing of the Northern Europeans at the resorts where parts of this were filmed.) Having been to Greece, and in particular, Crete, for an extended period of time, this dvd failed to capture any authentic sense of the land or its people. I could tolerate a cliched look at Greece if the cinematography was even semi-professional and 'pretty', but this was a joke. At one point, there is a montage of windsurfing stock footage that seemingly has no place in the dvd. Color, sound and overall quality are poor and not worth the purchase, unless you've been to Greece and want a laugh. The only good thing that came out of watching this was my increased confidence in my own ability to produce a video for wide distribution."
1,Not for Kids - Topless Sunbathers in Opening Scene,The description on Netflix of this DVD said that it was a tour of Greece for children and adults. The opening scene has topless sunbathers. Not appropriate for my 5th grade class...
3,Beautiful pictures but too many ingrediants per recipe!,"Had this book for a few years, but the recipes are basically untouched. The few we did try worked out, but not as well as hoped. The list of ingredients seem fussy and the sheer number of them are daunting. But there are pictures for each recipe, which is why we bought it. However, it was lots of fun to look at the book and imagine eating the dishes!"
3,Not bad. A good book for novices.,"This is pretty decent book. There are a few recipes for some of the old standbys in westernized Chinese restaurant's (Sweet and Sour Pork and Lemon Chicken, for example) but there are plenty of more interesting and lesser known dishes as well. I have a huge Chinese cookery book library and this is not even in the top twenty of my favorites but I would have no problem recommending it to people who want a first or second book to learn a little Chinese cooking. There are full page beautiful photographs for each recipe as well as helpful little instructional pictures accompanying the text. I found the recipes for Kung Po Chicken and Fish-flavoured Shredded Pork to a bit tame chili-wise but perfectly good introductions to these quintissential Sichuan dishes."
5,Simply wonderful!,"Mogambo is a must-see! I didn't think it was going to be so great, I was just going to see the film because Clark Gable was in it. But Ava Gardner was magnificent, she was sexy and beautiful. Grace Kelly was great for the role as the married gal. Clark Gable was of course the hunk that everyone loves! The film keeps you in your seat from the first scene to the last. Just watch it, you'll love it!"
5,Good Movie,"I am not a movie critic. I just know if I like a movie and if it entertains me. I liked this movie and it did entertain me. For those of you who like detailed reviews on movies, I realize this will not help you."
2,Healing the Infertile Family,"I read this book cover to cover. from the beginning it wasn't grabbing my attention.I was very bored while reading it.It's main focus to me was on older couples, 35 and up, with infertility problems. Completely ignoring the younger reader such as myself. (I'm 24 and have had infertility issues for 4 yrs.)I did like the interviews the author used to express the couples actual feelings, although, my husband and myself didn't seem to relate to a lot of the male perspective and some of the female perspective the author was giving. The title is -Healing the Infertile family:Strengthening your relationship in the search for Parenthood- I don't feel like I learned any new coping techniques,I don't feel any good information on what my husband and myself could do to strengthen our relationship was presented like the title would insinuate. So I rate this book only 2 stars."
5,The place to start,This is THE book to get you in to Projection Display Systems. There's none better. All the basic problems you are likely to encounter over and again are dealt with here. Highly recommended.
5,Thinking Strategically Is More Important Than Tanks and Guns,"This book, apart from being the world's longest job description (for a Counselor to the President for Grand Strategy), remains a vibrant and provocative discussion relevant to guiding the Nation into the 21st Century. Part I discusses the ""world theater"" and Part II discusses in turn a grand strategy and then political, public, deterrence, negotiating, resources, technology, Third World, and economic strategies. The book ends with thoughts on organizing for strategy that should, because of who wrote them and how good they are, be required reading, in their twelve-page entirety, for the President and his entire Cabinet team."
5,Bon Voyage,We are planning a Disney Cruise for May 2004 and this book is full of the most valueable information I have ever come across on Cruise ships. The maps alone are worth the purchase. I love the details described for the staterooms and I have never found info on ports and shore excursions in any other books like what is printed here. Great job Jennifer & Dave
5,Pet Food,Only food I will give my pet pigeon. She loves it expecially the split green peas. She picks those out first.
1,transmitting distance is not as effective as claimed,I purchased this PLL Stereo FM Transmitter for my church. The meeting hall is only approx. 50' X 50' under one single roof. Less than half of the area can receive the signal. I am very frustrated and would like to return it but I found out that the article cannot be returned if it is opened up unless there is material defective.This product calims better transmitting distance than other products and it is the reason that I purchased it but it does not perform as it claims.
2,Hard to understand why it is praised so much,"I follow formula 1 very keenly and am quite updated about the latest websites as well as relevant books. I ordered this one because of the praises that this book had received on amazon but have to say that I am thoroughly disappointed after reading it. Yes, it is funny at times and in the overall scheme of things in life this may have relevance to persistence or perseverance but I found it hard to finish because it was not getting anywhere. There wasn't any achievement which is the hallmark of formula 1 as a game. The author blathers about his stupidities which I believe has been found to be amusing by many."
5,Flat Crazy,The world would be a better place if more people had this kind of passion. Fortunately for the reader the passion is tempered with hilarious anecdotes and a stream of bad luck.
1,Fragile,It feels like a toy. Very light and made of plastic! Not what I expected at all. Of mediocre quality.
1,Don't buy this,This thermometer is not calibrated and I see no way to calibrate it. Your milk will scald if you attempt to get within the range of 140 to 160 degrees F.Do not buy it.
3,I kept it.,"After using this thermometer to check the temperature at which water boils at sea level, I determined that it literally reads 20 degrees lower than actual temperature.I considered sending it back, but determined that the cost of shipping wouldn't be worth it. Instead, I just heat my milk to what the thermometer reads as 140 degrees (which is actually 160 degrees), and I have frothy goodness every time. I also appreciate that this thermometer clips onto the side of my pitcher and adjusts to whatever level of milk I am frothing.My only other beef is that the temperature range is so small. A clip-on thermometer would be great for candy-making, but it would need to register past 300 degrees (this thermometer only reads to 180--actually 200, of course).In conclusion, it's cheap, it's convenient, and (with some very simple math and my stainless steel Aerolatte milk frother), I am able to make mounds of frothy milk for my latte."
4,Works great!,This was a good purchase. I use it everyday and it works great! It gives you an appropriate temperature range for the milk so you will have to find the temperature that you prefer. The first time I used it I heated it to the top of the shaded temperature and it was way too hot! I find that the middle range temperature works best for me. I have had it for about a month now and I have no complaints.
5,Good product,Excellent product! I am happy that I purchased this along with the stainless frothing pitcher and double insulated shot glasses to make my expresso maker complete. The thermometer helps greatly to achieve the desired frothing temperature. Prior to this arriving it was guess work and I had to nuke the latte to achieve the desired temperature. Spend the extra couple of cents for this and you will appreciate it.
3,Taylor Classic Cappuccino Frothing Dial Thermometer,Works well but the clip could be firmer and I'd recommend that the shaded area showing the desired temperature be red or light blue. The yellow is too light against the white background.
3,Good quality but poor functionality,"I own several other Taylor thermometers and they are all very good quality items for their price range. However, this thermometer, though its quality is fine, lacks the temperature markings (i.e., it does not even go down to 100 F!) needed to perfect the steamed milk or frothed milk needed for lattes, cappucinos, or macchiatos. As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, once the temperature reaches 100 F, you should move the steam wand from the surface to the bottom. This is an essential step to get the perfect ""microfoam"" (not big soap bubbles) that makes for a fantastic latte or cappucino. Bottom line: find a thermometer that has easy to read numbers, a clip, and temperature that goes down to at least 100, but preferably lower."
5,Perfect for froth making,"This is an excellent constructed thermometer for making perfect froth. Indicator is tightly sealed and no fogging. And solid stainless-steel construction. I bought it a month ago and have no complain. Make sure you only need it for making froth and not other usages. If you look at the picture, you'll see the it only works at temperature from 120-180F. Good quality and nice price."
1,Slow To Measure Temperature,"In my short time using this thermometer, it does not read the milk temperature as quickly as I think it should. What this means is that you could accidentally scald frothed milk if the temperature rises too much above 160 degrees.I cannot recommendc this product. It is better to learn the temperature of your frothing pitcher by touch; rater than rely on an inaccurate measuring device."
1,Avoid this model!,"First, I feel foolish for having bought this thermometer in the first place, seeing as the range on the display is 120-180. This essentially eliminates being able to ensure that milk to be frothed is cold enough. Plus, milk for lattes should never be stretched beyond 100 (even lower if you have a more powerful frother), which, obviously, is below the range of this thermometer. Then there's the responsiveness problem. By the time this thermometer registers 140, the milk is already screeching violently.I bought this thermometer to replace a digital instant-read thermometer that I had ruined by keeping it too close to a hot grill. But I'll definitely be buying a better thermometer."
4,cappuccino thermometer,wonderful little thermometer. Allows you to make cappucino froth just like the big guys. Only consideration is that it is only 5 inches long. Not meant for tall container. Get a frothing cup to fit.
4,recommended,"Inexpensive and easy to read even without glasses, and does the job. At first the thermometer will do nothing, then all of a sudden it really moves, so I am glad to have a thermometer or I would probably burn the milk, because I am just starting. Hope that it is a long-lasting product."
1,Unresponsive and inadequate,"This thermometer is terrible. It lags about seven seconds behind my digital probe thermometer, so you need to correct and allow several seconds of ""coasting"" time. The instructions say to keep it at least 2"" in the milk; but when frothing in a 20oz pitcher for a 12oz drink, you start with less milk than that. If this thermometer were acceptably responsive, I'd ding it for not reading 100F, but the responsiveness issue makes everything else moot.This might be a barely adequate choice if you have a very slow steaming machine, or if you're dealing with large quantities of milk. But otherwise you'll be happier with a good instant-read digital thermometer."
4,Cappuccino Thermometor,I like the large clearly maked dial. The clip that holds it to the decanter is fairly tight but you have to hold it when you pour the milk into your coffee mug or remove it before doing so. Much better than the first thermometor I bought.
4,pretty good,"This thermometer works fine. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although the stem is stainless steel, the face is plastic and feels really cheap."
3,better stuff out there,there are better thermometers out there. temperature gauge is only from 180 to 120. the clip is weak and doesnt hold well. previously I used a office paperclip and a regular digital thermometer and I will return to that setup. check alton brown for the paperclip and thermometer technique.
3,Average at best,"This thermometer does the job. However, the graduated marks stop at 180 degrees rather than >212. Without the upper scale, you can't tell how accurate this thermometer actually is."
1,Overpriced plasticky piece of junk,"Sorry, I don't get the positive reviews of this item. It's a flimsy piece of plasticky junk. If you have low standards and want to pay too much, this item is for you."
1,Arrived but does not work,"Not worth the hassle involved to return product, will buy at the store next time. Not Amazon's fault!"
1,Never received this product,"I cannot review this product because I never received it. If your records indicate that you sent it to me and that you charged me for it, you need to revise your records. It was an item that was not available at the time I ordered it and so I elected to find it elsewhere which I have never done."
1,Disappointment,I was looking forward to this documentary and was let down. There was a lack of details and failed to revel the suspect or where he was. I cannot recall if they even reveled the evidence that pointed to the suspect.
5,"superaquatics, superfun","This is a super nintendo game that my daughter owned many years ago. She recently got a super nintendo. (ours bit the dust) She absolutely loves the game, and it is in perfect working condition. Thanks for making her day!"
5,Intimate Jam Session with Sassy,"Wow! One word that can describe this CD, an intimate, yet powerful look at the Divine One. The CD captures the smoky, after-hours feel of the nightclub, you feel like you're sitting in at a live jam session. The listener is totally bedazzled by Sassy's commanding interpretations of these classic songs. She is well served by her jazzy trio; there's plenty of expert playing accompanying her dazzling vocals. Vaughan has always excelled under minimal instrumentation because her vocal skills get more chance to shine. Wisely, Sarah keeps her well-known power in control and never overwhelms the material. These songs have been performed almost to an overkill by various artists, but Vaughan certainly sheds new light with her skill and emotional reserve. A rare and not well-known recording that merits more attention by jazz fans all over."
4,My favourite Vaughan album,"I agree with everything the others have said. I posses the LP of this recording ""Ronnie Scott's Presents Sarah Vaughan Live""; bought back when it first came out. It is well used so now play the CD. BUT why is ""Send in the Clowns"" missing off the CD; surely one of her best renditions of this song? Track it down and wonder why it was left off the CD. Almost the only reason I keep my record deck."
1,Preposterous!,"These are the worst oblique pen holders I own. They were great for getting started in calligraphy because I bought them at a local store for $1.85 ea. This was last year, not a decade ago. At nearly $8 I've seen very few larger rip-offs on Amazon. Google them, you will immediately find a much cheaper price."
1,shame on bodum new production,"I waited for these to reappear for a month, having purchased the originals way back and needing to fill in my set. The new manufacturer is inferior by far to the original. The size is different, one came cracked and had to be replaced and the other one cracked at the rim after one use. I never use them and don't recommend buying them unless they revert to previous manufacturing standards. I am surprised at Bodum, previously a quality product."
3,Love These; Fragile,"We got these glasses for ourselves for Christmas last year and used them just about every day-- we loved them. We also hand-washed them after every use because they seem so fragile. This morning, one of them cracked while being washed. So, despite our extra care, we are now 20 dollars down with only one mug to show for it (and who knows how long that will last).Besides that, they do seem to keep our hot drinks hotter than a regular mug for longer. Beautiful and chic. Would have been 5 stars if they both lasted longer than 10 months."
1,Don't waste your money on this.,I was so disappointed. I didn't think Vince gill could do anything bad but this thing was practically Christmas Muzak. We played it ONE time and threw it in the trash.
2,Highbrowed Idealism,"I had to absolutely force myself to finish the last two chapters. I am so cheap that had I bought the book used, I would not have finished it. Except for the portion of the book that focused on how the European Union would (will) influence ""The End Of The American Era,"" this reader found nothing but a plethora of idealistic ""if's"" and a profound absence of other substance to bolster the author's assertion."
2,Beautiful Show - Meager Go,"While this book is beautifully designed and produced, and has many stunning photographs, as a highly experienced pizza maker, we feel it is best left on the coffee table, and kept out of the kitchen.Unfortunately, form and graphic design are the prime focus.Master pizzaiolos will not lose sleep over this one; no secrets are revealed.Those who wish to learn to make great dough are far better off reading Nancy Silverton."
3,"Good, but has it's flaws","This is definitely a nice set, especially for the price.However, it has some flaws:1) The white glazed finish scratches fairly easily when using sharp knives;2) the bread/side dish has a lip that is too wide for its base. Specifically, when you push down on this plate with a knife or fork anywhere on the lines, the plate tilts up. It's just not balanced well;3) Similarly, the mugs aren't designed all that well from an ergonomic standpoint. When they are full, they just feel as though they can tip over way too easily, since they are much wider at the brim then at the base.Unless you really like the color/pattern, I suggest you choose one of the other patterns in this series."
1,Poor product,"Slow to register temperature, probe is too big and has difficulty entering the meat. Too heavy to stand up on its own on the grill. A disappointment. I would have returned it save for the hassle and the low cost. An earlier version (digital) died after a brief life. Avoid this company's products in my humble opinion.Eric"
3,Nothing to do back flips over....,"This is very similar to an earlier version of this Taylor I used for several years. This one slipped out of my hand and I cracked the glass within a couple of weeks. So, I did a little research and picked up an instant read thermometer made by CDN that is terrific. I love it! You do need to do a bit of planning so that you run your temperature check before what you're cooking is overdone. Past that, the CDN is worth every penny."
3,NOT dishwasher safe,"I'm not sure who's asleep at the wheel, but...The Taylor website says this is dishwasher safe.Amazon says it is dishwasher safe.I just bought it because it was supposedly dishwasher safe.BUT when I got it, it says very clearly on the package ""Do not immerse in water."" and ""Do not put in dishwasher.""Sounds NOT dishwasher safe to me.Its going back."
1,Never worked at all !,The very first time my wife attempted to use this in the broiler the temperature arrow never moved and the interior dial turned blackThis thermometer never functioned correctlyThis thermometer is a complete waste of moneyHopefully I will be able to get a refund through Amazon
1,Child's Dorothy wigs,"These children's Dorothy wigs are a total disappointment!! The wigs fit neither of my 6 year old granddaughters, and so are a total waste of time and money!! They are considerably too small, and do not even cover the head! Needless to say I have two disappointed little Dorothys! I feel I should be able to return these wigs, but I believe that option is unavailable to me."
4,Nice quality wig for the price.,"My daughter loved how this wig changed her looks. I liked the quality for the low price. The only problem was that she said it was scratchy, and didn't want to wear it for a long time. She's in kindergarten so its not surprising, it didn't seem too bad to me."
5,Very cute,I was worried that the size would be too large for my 5 yo daughter's petite head but it fit her perfectly and she looks adorable in it! I think the price is a little high for a dress up wig for Halloween but I didn't find a nicer wig any cheaper any where else. I am pleased with it.
4,Fits,This fit my 6 year old great for Halloween. The color is a bit red but it was cute with the Dorothy costume that I made her.
2,Disappointing Video,"I bought this on the recommendation of a ""friend of a friend"", with high expectations that it would contain something of value. It turned out to be a bad imitation of a Monty Roberts ""join-up"" session, without any of the follow up work of the Roberts videos.There are a few scenes where ""Pony Boy"" is shown riding, and from what you can see, he really doesn't ride very well either.Bottom line: Save your money for something more informative."
5,Replaced Cuisinart with Kitchenaid,"My 80 yr. old mother couldn't use her new Cuisinart mixer so I ordered her the Kitchenaid KHM900ER. She loves how the low speed is low, and it has plenty of power to mix a double batch of cookies. It is light weight and comfortable for her to hold. She loves it!"
5,I LOVE IT!!,"I haven't used it much yet, but love it so far. I love the digital speed control. Compared with the other hand mixer I had, this one is a jewel. The other one seemed to have only one speed and that was FAST. I would recommend this mixer."
4,Good but one defect,"I love this mixer, it is quiet, and powerful and easy to clean; best hand-held mixer I have ever had. I've had it for over a year now and it is still working great. My only complaint (why I didnt' give it 5 stars) is that the cord is stiff, very stiff and it gets on the way of your forearm when working and in the mixtures, etc. I don't know if this is a KitchenAid thing, but I think either way they should/could improve it."
5,Extremely well built.,"Excellent Item, Extremely well built. The first thing that led me to a Kitchen Aid brand in the first place was the the fact that you are able to buy the beaters separately. I had had cheaper mixers but after a short time if a beater blade happened to break (and they did) that, as they say was that.The only reason I was prompted to buy a new mixer was the fact that we had had ours since we got married and after bouncing it off of the floor for the third time finally cracked the case, although it did still work."
5,Seeing it in practice,Having read all the books it was good to see the training in practice. It certainly added to the knowledge I received from the books.
3,"the best ska band from ct., but should've stuck with moonska","It's not that the actual music on this album is stale, it's the production of it. It doesn't have the bite that allof us from skannecticut (tune-inn) appreciated from spring heeled tapes (all two of them, let's not forget the demo: Rude angel rude angel...say you'll be miiine/ shout out to meghan D. if you ever see this). Moonska just had better ska producers than the major label shmucks they got suckered into working for. Spring heeled live gives you better vibes than a river ofjolt cola. may the force with you."
3,arghhhhh,"it's an ok cd. doesn't at all compare to static world view. it's more ska/punk and its kinda blah... heh...... for the more ska fan, i suggest static world view."
4,"Spring Healed Jack, not the rock band.","This is a great CD with a lot of great songs. The lyrics are very unique. The horn section does a fantasic job, and so does the rest of the band does a good job too. Their tunes are very catchy and you will find yourself singing them a lot."
2,Feels flimsey when using,"I don't know how long it will last. the first time I used it, the metal levers appeared to bow when pressure was applied. It did cut the potato, but needed a lot of pressure."
3,miss this cutter,"We bought this probably 2 years ago and LOVED it. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 6 months with moderate use. I was careful to give the handle/potato a little help if stuck, but my petite wife expected the handle to take the force and always cut through any spud - it didn't and the side handle gave way and eventually broke. Would love to get another, but we settled for hand cutting fries in the meantime. Will probably look for something more durable to handle the workload of a family of 7."
1,Not real programming,"If you are serious about developing for the Palm OS platform look at other books like the one from O'Reilly (ASIN 1565928563). This book is very lightweight and only covers forms ""programming"" but will not teach you how to join the growing Palm OS developer community. It is not the first book from Sams that I checkout, I dont know how they let this one out."
2,If you like to spend money on programming,"If you prepare to spend your money on palm programming platform, this book is the best choise. if not get another one. Two stars for the palm introduction in front of book."
1,Misleading title,"When I see ""Teach Yourself Palm Programming,"" Ithink of C/C++, NOT using Satellite Forms. This book has one chapter close to the end about using CodeWarrior, and without much detail at all. Never mind that the SAMS series makes such an infomercial-like claim that you'll learn _anything_ in 24 hours, this takes their deceptive marketing tactic to a new level.I don't know how this is at its Satellite Forms tutorial, but I didn't care to find out."
1,Lacking,"I am interested in developing executable applications and not runtime interpretted forms. A large part of this book(12 chapters) deals with Satellite Forms and Pendragon Forms, which did not interest me. Also, the chapter on the BASIC interpreter did not interest me. The remaining 11 chapters provide a good introduction to the Palm OS and programming with the C language, but fail to provide an adequate tutorial.This book fails in its discussion of CodeWarrior. File Menu Options for CodeWarrior are listed and defined, but their uses are never demonstrated. I couldn't get the example application(MusicBox) to work. I received two error messages from CodeWarrior by simply opening the MusicBox project file.If you are New to Palm development and unfamiliar with CodeWarrior, I recommend that you look elsewhere for an adequate introduction to Palm development."
2,demo software doesn't work with examples in book,"Chapter 7 (Satellite Forms) was obviously developed with the full version of the code. The demo version (free with book) supports only 4 tables, but the text examples use 5 tables. Chapter 9 doesn't work because the code won't run. Many of the examples don't match what is on the computer screen, so a novice will become very confused. There is an inexcusable lack of ""final test"" to catch these types of errors.The Code Warrior (demo software also supplied) chapters talk about development and programming, but debugging is only mentioned. The debugging system doesn't seem to work, and the help files are not included.I spent significant time documenting chapter 7 ""version skew"" errors and sent info to Sams, so maybe version 2 will be better. I learned some good overview level stuff, but "" . . . where's the beef?"" kept coming to mind. I am looking for another reference ."
3,The book does what it says,"It tesches you how to program on a Palm in 24 hours. OC, there's no way it can teach you how to really be a programmer and use the Pam as one of the platforms you develop for. But that is implicet in the title of the book.I used it to learn how to write a little app that I wanted to write. I know much coding in many languages so I was able to take the little peices from the book and make them do what I wanted them to do. For someone who really wants to learn how to program the Palm from scratch it's not a book you would br a programmer after you finished it. It's like an introductory cource on some subject. Start here if you know nothing then move onto books with real ""meat"" in them."
3,Forget to mention the $800 price !,"After I completed the well-informed part of Satellite Forms, I went to the PUMA website for updated information, and was startled at the high price of $795, not mentioned in the book.On the message board, there were complaints about no support of Access 2000. The new 3.5 version is under pre-beta test only.Since the trial 3.1 edition is so limited in function, as is the 2.0 supplied with the book, I think all readers should know these situation before they tried this book."
1,Not for Mac based developers,"If you're a PC developer, this book is OK for you. If you are a Mac (or UNIX?) based developer, stay away from this book. About 1/2 of the book is dedicated to forms development packages that only work on a PC platform."
2,Disappointed.,"This set was falsely advertised as 18/10. It's actually 18/8 which is clearly stamped on the back. Mistakes happen, but I have to say this is certainly a whopper! But still, I got a good price on the set (although I can't help feeling gipped). I'll probably end up keeping them... return shipping won't be chump change (pretty hefty in weight). The only positive I can review is that the design is fairly nice. So buyers beware!!!"
5,Eclix La Perla,I tried this product because I could no longer find the exclix la perla in a liquid form in a spray bottle. Smells the same and is great. Would recommend.
3,So I went running out to buy this...,"...after reading the reviews on this site. I have seen the video many times and I think it's fun to watch. I was very interested in hearing Made of Glass but frankly, I was a bit disappointed in it. Maybe it will grow on me. The remixes on this CD single of GYU are ""okay."" If you want to hear a really great mix that will get your toes tapping and make the title cut the pop song it should've been released as, buy the Mark Jason Mix. It's the best mix!"
2,Unworthy sequel to Actraiser,"If you were expecting anything like the first game, you will be disappointed. What I especially did not like was the lack of the Sim-city mode. It's all action/side-scrolling now. The first Actraiser had interesting side-scrolling levels with a nice array of challenges and enemies. The levels in Actraiser 2 are just frustrating. There's nothing wrong with a challenge, but the level of challenge even in Easy mode is so ridiculous it's discouraging. There's nothing wrong with losing lives while trying to figure out a level, but it takes so many attempts to go through a level because the enemies keep coming at you. Trying to work out a strategy to deal with enemies becomes time-consuming, and after you beat one level, you know you're going to have to do it all over again with another level. The time spent trying to master one level sucks all the fun out of the game. If you're a masochist who enjoys being frustrated, this is your game! Otherwise, avoid."
1,Sorry Software,"The software does not work. After installing and auto linking to my computer's word, the software would not execute. I tried on 3 different computers to make sure it wasn't a computer error. After which I called for tech help. When I told them the problem, we were conveniently disconnected twice. Both times I called back I was connected to voice mail. Left a message, but ALAS, no one EVER returned my call. Save yourself the trouble. Get something else!!!"
1,Waste of time and money!,"This is an outdated version, it does not work. Website does not exist, can't get any help from help desk. Should be taken off the the market unless you have a very old computer. If I could, I would have given it a 0 star. Very disappointed."
1,dose not work with my program,dose not work with my program but i'm keeping it till i get the right program to work. bought this so i may communicate with my tenant in the trailor park i run.
1,A waste of talent,"I sure lost my money on this CD. The idea to make this album was good but..... it just did not happen. All the excellent artists invited to make it were not sufficient. It was just a waste of talent. The songs were poor, specially the one with Milly Quezada ""Somos Tal Para Cual"", no wonder nobody want to listen to ""salsa"" lately. The only one tune that is really good is ""Mas"". Being an Ismael Miranda follower since the 70's it's just dissapointing to have bought this album. Only 8 tunes and a little over 30 minutes. I guess they were just thinking about making a quick buck, and probably they will succeed."
4,In search of the landscape as essential...,"This biography offers its readers a wide range of suggestions and examples how American landscape entered into the American cultural essence as an icon, a point of reference. Obvious that photographers could inhale deeper this magic: great prairies, majestic spaces of woods and water, and so on. Adams fought all his life for this searching, his adventure followed this last century, expecially for what's ""preservation of nature and animals/plants nature contains"". Thank you, Adams, from one among million walkers and photographers! Fred T. from Turin, Italy."
3,"Cute basket, but certainly not green!","This basket is stated to be green, but it's really brown! The chain is silver and I thought it would matter, but it doesn't look that great with my black shepards hook."
5,Comments:,"Although I totally agree with the brilliance set by the band, I must disagree with the reviewer of August 3rd 2004. Melodic death has never died - as a matter of fact its become more underground than ever. Bands like Soilwork and In Flames aren't even considered melodic death anymore, although they were kings at what they did.I also disagree with the statement that Dark Tranquillity and Opeth are getting worse with each release. I think they are either getting better or remaining the same.I do agree that the number of melodic death bands are decreasing in the new age, and our old bands are dying. However, melodic death does have fresh starters everywhere.Lastly, this album is doom metal. Look at the lyrics and the overall style. It IS mixed with some melodic death but much of it is doom metal.Here are 2 new melodic death bands: Arsis and Within Y"
2,Beyond Oil and Gas review,"I read the book in one sitting. Repetition of many statements chapter after chapter made the book less convincing rather than more so. Better editing could have made it shorter and more persuasive.Methanol may indeed be an effective energy storage medium, but the significant material, manufacturing and economic challenges to make methanol fuel cells viable is glossed over. Sweeping predictions for future economic viability of technologies that will glean CO2 from the atmosphere also created some skepticism. It will take lots of money to make this reality, and at least half of Congress is still owned by oil companies."
5,Great buy,Just bought the Taylor Pro Freezer-Refrigerator Themometer and couldn't be happier with the purchase. The dial is bright and easy to readThe swivel hangar or stand makes it convenient to p;aace anywhere.JR
3,ok,I started watching these but got bord. I have owned them for almost a year now and still have almost 3 seasons to watch.
1,Didn't receive the item,Karlson's Corner charged me but didn't ship the product. And they don't reply to emails. NOT REAL HAPPY WITH AMAZON MARKETPLACE.
1,Charged up????,Really disappointed with this item. The batteries I've charged (AAA) I use for my MP3. They're only good for 20 minutes of use on a full charge. Ridiculous! This was such a waste of money. A huge let down.
3,E36 Bentley manual review,"I bought this for help replacing my starter. The instructions were lacking so much info on this difficult task that it was virtually useless. It is still useful for much info about the car, but for any task like this, it is thoroughly incomplete. You would be far better off with the wealth of info on pelicanparts dot com and the various forums. They give far better pictures, far more specific steps and tools needed.It's still a good book to have for your car, just not for this type of task."
4,Excellent but not complete,"Excellent service information probably the most complete avaialble. But yet you still need the Electrical Service Manual (the wiring diagrams are easier to decipher), and the information found in the following: Haynes' and Chilton's 3 series manuals plus Motorbooks workshop's ""101 Performance Projects for your BMW 3 series 1982-2000"". Too bad the complete ""original"" FACTORY BMW SERVICE MANUAL is unavailable."
3,auto-book review,"A fair book , pity they didn't include the most prized E36 3 series ever made the Euro M3. I'm sure many Americans would have imported this top of the range unit into the USA. Seems a shame the entire engine section has to be ignored, surely a little extra effort would not have been too much to ask. The price does represent a good value for money purchase, even with so much missing that could have been so easily added. Dave"
2,Bmw,Manual leaves out some necessary steps or assumes you know already know how to disassemble the part. Photos lacking in clarity. Good electrical diagrams. A. Good parts manual might be a good companion with this book.
3,its OK ... but not to everybody,i was little disappointed about the contents as its not clear enough.... though you still can get some helpful information. I do not regret buying it
5,A must need for every Beemer owner,This was especially important for me since I bought a 318i with no ownwers manual. It tells you everything you need to know to service a Beemer.Ken
4,satisfied customer,"the manual has become very helpful for minor repair jobs, and the placement of various parts. I recently was able to help my boyfriend via phone while he was out of town give him directions on how to take his back seat out; the diagrams and detailed info is very helpful. I just wish that there were more pictures to accompany the written instructions."
4,Clear and useful.,"Really good and very useful for the do it yourselvers.Photos schemas and explanations made step by step, makes one feel sure before trying anything on the car."
2,Worst of the three,"I bought all three major repair manuals (that I could find) for my 94 318is. I had read the other reviews here stating that bentley book was poor, so I was not expecting much. I was really shocked how poorly it described the operations that I was looking to perform on my car. I am trying to clean/remove the idle air control valve on my car, and that may/maynot require removal of the upper intake manifold. My chilton manual spends pages and 20+ pictures on the operation, haynes is half a page, bentley barely a paragraph. Yes, the book is useful for a third opinion sometimes. Its not worth 50 dollars though."
2,Not as good as it is thick.,"The book is fine for doing basic maintance. Changing the oil. Replacing shocks that kind of thing. However there is NO and I mean NO information for more advanced mechanics like rebuilding the steering rack, Transmission, Clutch master or slave cyl etc. It is a thick book but surprisingly donesn't seem to have any more information than a haynes manual (I have both). I'd say buy the haynes and save some $."
2,Very Vague,"I have previously owned various Volkswagen cars and used the Bentley manuals on CD-ROM. I was very disappointed when I purchased this book. It is very vague, refers you to the dealer in some instances (whereas the VW book had instructions on how to use the factory tools!).For example I went to change the engine belts and it arbitrarily suggests that you can use any size wrench. That is incorrect, there is only one size that can be use and the book does not say which it is. And anyways you cannot gain access to the belts without removing other parts (which are not specified). The other Bentley manuals would have carefully detailed the removal process.The list goes on. Change your differential fluid? VW Bentley would have had the exact VW tool number to use. Instead I ended up paying the cost of the book to have someone do it because, again, it arbitrarily says to use a 14mm allen socket which does not fit in the provided space."
5,Mystery on the Field,"It wasn't surprising that this book started off with Nancy and her friends going somewhere to relax and have fun. Nor was it surprising that Nancy stumbled on to a mystery. What was surprising though, was how the auther manage to work a mystery into a Baseball Game. I still get amazed at how Nancy Drew figures out all these complicated problems and still saves the day. This time it's to help a star pitcher find his little girl and still win a game. I've been reading Nancy Drew for over 9 years now and I think that this one was one of the best!"
5,The Autobiography of a Contemporary Master,"Admirers of Trevor's masterly fiction will enjoy these incisive, witty, heartbreaking essays revisiting his youth and early adulthood. The short piece about his parents is probably the most moving thing he's ever written. Most writers use autobiography to settle scores; Trevor uses it to give shape to the life of memory--a shape, in its own way, just as artful and just as true as the shape he gives to the life of his fiction."
4,Vintage game controller,The controller works perfect and has been used almost none stop by the kids...very satisified.
3,"It works, but lacks the original feel","The buttons are different, perhaps sticky? I can notice a performance different with my one original controller and this imitation. Shipping costs probably make this a bad deal, unless you need a backup or can live with it."
1,Waste of money,"My FC Twin came with a controller that doesn't work. I bought this to replace it, and it doesn't work either. Needless to say, I'm angry and annoyed."
1,Defective controllers,"Bought 2 of these controllers. Neither one worked correctly. I've purchased controllers from 3 seperate vendors on Amazon. None of them worked. When you press the down button in Dr. Mario, the capsule/pill goes to the right, not down."
1,Decent Shooter not worth of 5 stars,"This is an ok shooter, but it is not a 5 star game I don't even know if I would consider it a 4 star game and for that reason I am leaving a 1 star as this game is a 3 to 4 star game at best."
1,Returning book immediately,"I ordered this book hoping to find some good recipes for BBQing but instead I found a book that would you give part of the recipe and then you need the secret ingredient, cookshack's rib rub. Most of the recipes require you to order different types of rubs from cookshack instead of giving you the information needed to make the rub."
4,get smokin,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my son in Law the book was a good price and was shipped very fast. The book seem to be alittle faded but other than that Im pleased.
2,Vocaly and dramatically poor Maria Stuarda,"Mercadantes Maria Stuarda it is very interesting opera,unfortunatelly had been recorded not completelly ,hightlights,only.All singers , chorus and orchestra professionally in very satisfing level exept of singer of Maria Stuarda who is vocaly and dramatically lower then avrege ...Saound quality is good..."
3,Be Careful When Using,"Now, to be perfectly frank, I like this peeler. However, it does merit a little extra finger watching when using. I won't call myself an expert cook by any means, but I know my way around a kitchen.Using this peeler I've managed to cut myself quite a few times. It's not for lack care - it just slips sometimes and the sharp, knife-like tines that make the julienne cuts very easily can slide and julienne your fingers or the area between thumb and forefinger.Again, it's a good piece to have in the kitchen. It just merits a little care in its use."
3,"Worth it for certain vegetables, maybe not for others","Works great on firm, carrot sized veggies - zuccini, cucumber, etc. However hopes of using it on round vegetables can be difficult, like jicama or beets, or on peppers. It works to cut the jicama into thinner sections but I end up with a lot of butts and it can be frustrating since trying to julienne the remaining butts by hand makes for an unevenly cut cole slaw. Also hasn't been that easy on sweet potato."
5,I LOVE THIS TOOL,"This tool is amazing. its perfect for making slaws, veg noodles, etc. I like to quick pickle carrots and cucumbers when serving asian foods (i.e. lettuce wraps or any kind of asian bbq meat) and this cuts carrots PERFECTLY for that (and super fast too). Its a little bit annoying to clean, but nothing that makes me question using it. I've used it on other veg too - zucchini, sweet potato, apple, cucumber, etc.bottom line, i love this tool and would suggest it to anyone who enjoys cooking and playing around with recipes."
2,Doesn't work for softer vegetables,"I haven't tried this yet for carrots, or potatoes, but did try it for apples, and zucchini, and all it did was create a mess."
3,Is this the same as the $20 one at Sur La Table?,This sounds like a great product. But why is what looks to be the same is just $20 on the Sur La Table website?
4,Julienne,"This was purchased as a gift. It appears to be very good quality. I believe the recipient was quite pleased with the design. If I hear otherwise, I will make an addendum."
3,versus the Kinpira julienne peeler,"Cross-review with the Kinpira julienne peeler, which I gave 5 stars.Kinpira Peeler - JulienneI have switched over completely to the Kinpira."
2,Not easy to use,"When I ordered this julienne peeler, I had made a careful review of the similar products and had a great expectation of it. However, when it arrived, it just did not work as I expected. My mom tried to peel a carrot, which as most carrot in US, are thin and small. You can only peel the carrot a few slices, than you just cannot use the peeler to peel anymore, because the remaining part of the carrot is too slim to be safely handled by the peeler. I returned it immediately and hope to know what julienne peeler here can do a better job."
4,"Fun to read, but not a handbook.","The book is a collection of articles in various aspect of embedded programming. I found out I already read some of them on www.embedded.com. It is not a tutorial to someone totally new to embedded world, but it is very useful if you already have two years experience (or more). I feel it is a great book because there is something I can learn and apply to my project. It is fun to read a chapter when I have half hour.I do not give it a five star because it names itself Handbook, but not cover enough topic and lack of further reference if you want to dig deeper."
1,NOT AVENTURA,"The cover of this CD is misleading. I do not speak spanish but I love the band ""Aventura"". So when I saw this CD here at Amazon and I read some of the song titles listed for this CD I bought it. It turns out this is some other group that plays BANDA music, which I detest! They have the words AVENTURA on the front in big bold letters making you think that it is the other popular band that plays bachata music. Anyway I ended up throwing the CD out of my car window into a creek after listening to it. I should have done more research!"
3,Very good--just not what I was looking for.,"I was excited to get this book, because it was very well recommended. John and Caitlin Matthews reprint some historical essays that are hard to find, and write in a clear style. However, I thought it was too much dry history. I was forcing myself to get through it and not retaining what I read. This would be an excellent reference book, but not something I would plan on reading cover to cover."
4,Very Informative and Interesting.,"The Celtic Seers' Source Book was a very interesting book. I have been interested in the Celts and the Druids all of my life, and this book gave me more information into the ancient culture. Definetly worth taking a look at. Also contains lots of history."
4,Very Good Protection,"The case is very sturdy. I bought it for my Motorola Q9c and it fits really well, except it's a bit too tight but hopefully it'll loosen up a bit. Sometimes it's a little hard to take my phone out, but that has to do with the tightness. I really recommend it to anyone with a Q. It offers very good protection and now I don't have to worry about dropping and scratching the phone. I don't really have anything to say about the belt clip since I wont be using it, but it is removable in case anyone wants to know."
3,"nice, but not failsafe","Right out of the box, I liked this product for holding my blackberry. It is very sleek and sharp - looks much nicer than many small leathergoods made for electronics. I was extremely happy with it.But I was using it with the clip attached to my pocketbook. On more than one occassion, upon making some sort of jerking motion, the magnetic closure holding the blackberry in gave way, and my blackberry went flying out.If you were to keep this holder in someplace (maybe a briefcase or bag?) where its sole purpose was to protect it, then yeah - I think its really wonderful.But if you are using it as the external holder to sort of keep it with you (from falling out of a purse, car or briefcase), then I might not use it in this way. Right now, its just living with other 'unreliable' leathergoods in the bottom drawer of my desk."
2,Quality product at a great price,"UPDATED 3/14/2011 -- AccessoryOne is no longer shipping this item as specified, but rather substituting a ""universal"" case that is MUCH bigger -- about the size of an old Treo brick phone. Very disappointed when I ordered a replacement. Downgrading to 2 stars.Original Review:I have been using this product daily for about a year and it is only now beginning to show signs of wear. Considering the OEM Motorola-branded equivalent was torn up and unusable after only six weeks of use, that's nothing short of amazing.Sturdy plastic belt clip has a hook on the bottom to keep it from sliding up, and my MotoQ phone fits perfectly, even with the extended battery installed. Magnetic closure works well. I'm very pleased. When my current one finally wears out, I plan to replace it with the exact same product."
5,The case is solved,"This case was the perfect solution for me. I love the case, and I loved the price."
5,A BIOGRAPHY OF WONDER,"I believe this is the most talented man I have ever read about as regards an overall life. I couldn't determine anything particularly special about his childhood as to his relationship with his parents. From young manhood on his life is so outstanding it is difficult to believe....though I do so explicitly! This Polish Jew escaped from being in the ovens of the holocaust 2 or 3 times and those events are page turning. Then he becomes instrumental in the French Underground during WWII and has many harrowing experiences. Then he becomes a soldier in the U.S. Army (never yet being in the U.S.)and is instrumental in interrogating German prisoners...then develops an incredible program for learning foreign languages.[....]P>This book was so good for me I couldn't keep it to myself so I read it outloud to my wife and we both enjoyed it immensely. As to ""smarts,"" all people are NOT created equally; 'tis a joy to read about a gifted human being."
2,More like a test of patience,"It seems like everyone is trying to make money off of the Holocaust by writing heroic stories or by making overly dramatic movies. This book follows that trend by telling a story that tries to be compelling and inspiring, but ultimately falls short. I think we should give the Holocaust survivors some respect and leave them alone."
5,The M3&M5 Stuarts for the model maker and general historian,"I found this book excellant for the model maker,as I usually shy away from the vanguard series. With Jim Laurier and Steve J.Zagola (or anything with Steve Zagola"" J"" or not)Great referance material. I was doing a M3 Stuart and did not relize the varations of the M3 chassies. As I am a wood ship builder,I thought armor would be a nice change. Ha! now I have at least 6 verions to make. I have bought 5 more in this series,happily. Now for a quick review: The book shows a different paint pattern than the Mini-craft model for the Honey version ""Bellman "". Which I believe is correct as another tank from the same division is painted in the same sceme. As a modeler all I can say, is with this kind of material,It will be awhile before I build a wood ship."
1,not impressive,"I really wanted to enjoy this book. The moody English setting seems ripe for suspense, the characters all have something to hide, and the standards of this genre are low enough that I thought this would be a sure-fire laundromat read. Alas. The characters are one-dimensional and affected, and it is apparent not too long into the book who did it, though you don't find out why until the end -- and the revelation comes in a clumsy equivalent of finding a letter of confession written by the culprit. Also, the author's apparent fondness for the class system of Britain gets boring, and fast."
3,You can't save!,"I know, I know... you couldn't save in the 80's either with original Nintendo. However, as an adult, video games are a relaxing way to end the evening. I'm now spoiled by the modern games, and if I can't save, I'm not interested! :)"
5,This guy is scary,"Since I first read Critical Mass, Hagberg has had me hooked as a reader. I read Clancy, Bond, and others, but Hagberg seems to have more of an edge, like he's actually lived this life of covert operations. When I read Joshua's Hammer and the plot unfolded to involve Osama Bin-Laden, I was again hooked. When I learned that Bin-Laden indeed was thought to have cancer, it hit me that either Hagberg had this information through his intelligence circles well before us, or he just made a really good guess.I believe that his dynamic, realistic writing style owes a great deal to credible research done in the field by either Hagberg or some of his unnamed associates. The Bin-Laden storyline gives further credibility to this and in my mind establishes Hagberg as the pre-eminent author of this genre."
3,Relatively realistic; relatively pedestrian.,"Good airplane novel with the occasional passage that chills you to the bone, based on how prescient Hagberg was - given current events. It's written in a plodding style, and would have benefitted from an editor - the words shear/sheer, worse/worst being misused constantly, among others. A decent tale; didn't toss it, didn't cut my fingers racing to turn the page."
5,Superb thriller!!!,"This is one of those books that once you start reading, you cannot put it down. Superb thriller about Bin Laden trying to blow up the famous San Francisco bridge as revenge for his daughter's death. The characters are excellent, story just flows chapter after chapter. Writing is excellent, as always by David Hagberg. One of his best and worth the money."
2,Very poor quality,As a Bird lover I was looking for something our Teals would enjoy for a long time. Yes they do however the quality of this jungle gym is so poor that it started falling apart soon after assembly. it is now 4 months after purchase and the rope pole is actually cracked making that part of the fun useless. maybe for smaller birds this is a great toy but not for larger Teal type birds.
1,Misleading title,"I ordered this dvd from the UK, believing that I was purchasing a yoga dvd that also provided explanations & links between the asanas & ayurvedic dosha constitutions. However, throughout the 3 practice sesssions there is no mention at all of ayurveda - in fact it is much like any other yoga dvd available. As I am studying ayurveda & its links to yoga I thought this would provide useful information as well as a practice suited to the doshas - it does not. The mantras cannot be clearly heard as she talks over them & there is no practice sheet included as mentioned on the packaging. Most dissapointing & not suitable for yoga beginners. I am tempted to return it as I believe it is falsely advertised."
1,Worst yoga routine ever,"This is the worst yoga tape I have personally seen. The production value of this tape is horrible. First problem, the entire tape was shot with one camera. The whole time you just get a side view of the instructure. For thirty dollars I would like multible angles. There was moment I thought she was going to stop her pose to adjust the focus. Secondly, it looks as if the whole tape was shot in the instructures bedroom. And a small bedroom at that.There is nothing new as far as the routine goes. There are no new poses, or an ancient mind, body practice. The insructure seems bored with the routines as she is talking, very monotoned the whole time. And her voice is very nasal and just shall we say not soothing. This is just a badly done yoga routine that is horribly overpriced. If you want an excellent yoga routine try Shiva Rea or Baron Baptiste. STAY AWAY from this routine. It is the first Yoga tape I returned in three years!!!"
5,Band of rubber bands,"Ok, I'm not going to get excited about a simple bag of rubber bands, however I find that I use these rubber bands for more than securing liners on the kitchen trash can. I use them for tieing up frozen food bags, securing notes to my car visor and many other things. They are high quality and don't break! What more can you ask for from a simple rubber band?"
4,Does the Job,"This rubber band has saved us from having to dig into our garbage can and retrieve the bag when it falls in, which used to happen at least once a day!"
2,Not for Me,"This book is just not for me. The reason I bought it was to get some ideas on how to cook beans. But I find the recipes bland and uninspiring, based on the ingredients listed. I just find the author's palate hard to relate to. The flavor profile sounds VERY bland and middle American in a bad way, what one would think of really bad American food. The recipes seem healthful enough, but I need my food to taste good AND be healthy. Seriously, check out the pictures/ingredients before you buy it. Usually, when I buy cookbooks, I really connect to the pictures, presentation, and author's palate, but there is very little to connect me to this book. Unfortunately, a preview was not available at the time I purchased it."
4,Cool,"Mary-Kate and Ashley have been making videos forever.This movie was ok and they had neet clothes,I just hope that someday they will make a viedio without makeup or hairdressers just like regular kids,America and other countries need to see the real peole that they are ,just like you and me.I know that would be even better!"
3,foot spikes,i found that these work better for icy trails and in ice caves then actually climbing trees but it can be done it was very hard ihad to have my feet at the right angle to grip then i could not putmy wight on my foot like i wanted... dont buy it .. waste of money
1,"DO NOT BUY ,HORIBLE",these were good at first but on my third day using them one of he spikes fell out but thats what i get they were soooooo cheap
1,Crap,"Would only work if you were legit strong enough to break bricks. Made very well, but just not useful as you would imagine before buying"
2,ashiko,they are kwel but they wont stay on longer then a couple sec's without a velcro strap.otherwise it could make a good ninja weapon
2,Ehh....,They look great but they fall off WAY to easy... Not really worth it.... I was disappointed... NOT GOOD QUALITY
3,A cut above the usual,"A cut above the ususal muscle-man, sand-and-sandal movie. The plot, such as it is, hinges on exposing children to a drop of blood shed by the god Uranus as he flew into the sky fleeing the attack of his son Cronos. This ""drop"" of blood has burned its way into a mountain and the children are brought to this cave to be exposed to it and thereby turned into invincible warriors who, when they finally take off their helmets, look like some terrifying Nazi cloning experiment. For just a moment, this movie truly captures the wonder and awe of Greek myth. Reg Park is fine as Hercules -- rather less wooden than most, and the rest of the cast is OK. There's the usual bad dubbing and absurd dialogue. But there are genuine moments of wonder and a nice surprise or two."
1,"Poor, Poor Quality","This is the poorest quality book I have ever seen. Many pages are hard to read; almost like a dot matrix printer which is running low on ink. Additionally, after three weeks of use, pages three thru thirty FELL OUT!! I take care of my books and have NEVER had this happen! The material itself is good, but it is just a level of quality that I would never expect from a major publisher."
1,Knock off,"This is a knock-off and not the real thing! Shame on Amazon.com for selling Black market books! This is an obvious photocopy of the original! Who are you buying this book from? Obviously, I am not the only one complaining about this problem. DO NOT PURCHASE this book from Amazon.com, or any of the links that would bring you here, or you will get ripped-off as we were. If I could, I would have given 0 stars!"
4,good,great service. book arrived on time as expected with little to no delays. would highly recommend or purchase from buyer again.
1,POOR QUALITY PRINTING,"The print quality of this brand new textbook is the worst I've ever seen. It looks like a ""knock off"" rather than an original publication. At the same time, I ordered and received Qualitative Research: A Personal Skills Approach (2nd Edition) by Gary D. Shank--from the same publisher (Pearson, Merrill, Prentice Hall). The Shank book is of high quality, what you'd expect from a new textbook, but the Schram book looks like it was copied on cheap paper by a printer that's low on toner cartridge. Dr. Schram has written an excellent textbook on qualitative research. So, I highy recommend the textbook. Just make sure you check the print quality before you buy--it might be worth a trip to your local book store."
5,A Suburb Sequel/Remake,"This game is pretty much the first Castlevania, but remade in 16-bit graphics, improved controls, more levels, new music, and just pretty much anything you'd want in an old school side scrolling game. One of the best things about this game is that you can attack with your whip in 8 directions!"
3,Ok book,"The storyline was good but I found myself picturing the author typing out the story. My idea of a good book is when I'm sucked into the story and not thinking about thr writing of it. Some of the interaction of the characters seemed a bit forced and, in the very beginning, it was confusing as to what was happening - at least for me. I think the author has potential but needs to work on writing skills."
3,Great little glasses for espresso but a bit fragile,"You will like these enough to keep buying replacements as your wife periodically breaks them. Lightweight, great insulation and they cause most guests to do a double-take.If only they were a bit tougher. Recomend had washing, if you have steady hands."
5,classic indie,"Great tracks from the golden age of indie pop. Most of the tracks are probably available else where, but will probably cost a whole lot more."
2,Life span,The temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected! Over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it. This means the thermometer has a short life span for people who rely on the markings for anything (which granted is not everyone). Last time I buy an oven thermometer in which the markings don't sit behind a glass face!.
2,Unreadable,"I also bought this due to the first choice recommendation of Cook's Illustrated magazine. I suppose it is accurate as I don't have a professional temperature gauge to test it. It's stable when laid flat and you can hang it as well. The BIG problem is that the ink on the markings fade over time, either due to the high temp in the oven or something else. Grease also get splattered all over and impossible to remove. I rubbed it with a Brio pad but couldn't remove much stain though the ink faded even more. It's practically useless now, just sitting in my oven as I couldn't see the markings unless I took it out and look at it closely."
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this product because it was reviewed by a test kitchen and they said it was the best. I saw some of the reviews about the problem with the paint coming off and felt that it was just sore grapes from people that did not like the test kitchen. Well, it was not sore grapes. I used this thing once. Went to clean it and ALL the numbers rubed off. What a piece of junk!"
5,Oven Thermometer,"I bought this thermometer for my husband to checkour oven with; worked beautifully, He also used it onhis barbecue pit and said it worked. He found out heneeded to add a baffle to his pit to make it cook thetemperature he needed. I would recomend this productto anyone who need a oven thermometer."
2,inconsistent,"I bought two of these and tested them together in a new oven. I was disappointed to see that the two thermometers' readings differed by 25-50 degrees, depending on the oven's programmed temperature. That level of inconsistency is at least as bad as the cheap bi-metal thermometer I had before, if not worse."
2,Not Too Acurate,"The thermometer read 200 degrees when I put it into boiling water. Can't tell if the error is consistent over all temperatures.As others have pointed out, the numbers are printed on metal and will wear off if cleaned too vigorously.So, for a few dollars and for a few months, I'll have a rough idea of the oven temperature. Not what I want, but there don't seem to be other thermometers that are any better."
1,Inaccurate,"Purchased this item because of a recommendation in Cook's Illustrated magazine, and quickly discovered that our relatively new Trivection oven was apparently off by 30F!NOT!!! We've got two other thermometers (not intended as oven thermometers, but pressed into service) and the oven's thermostat that agree with each other closely. This thermometer is theoretically adjustable (i.e. the tube can be moved in its brackets) and apparently did so on its own.This thermometer is inexpensive (not cheap) but with Taylor's name on it, and Amazon selling it diredtly, one would expect it to be dead on out of the box. Why I was forced to calibrate a brand-new thermometer in boiling water is beyond comprehension."
1,not accurate,"This thermometer always read lower than the temperature I set for my oven. I had been told a mercury thermometer works best. When I finally had a professional come to check my oven, he said the thermometer was off by 25 to 50 degrees."
2,Not sure it works correctly,"I have used this several times now and get different readings depending upon the temperature set on the oven. I can't believe that my GE oven is that far off at 425 degrees, but it's okay at 350 degrees, so I'm blaming the thermometer. I could be wrong, I'll be purchasing another brand of thermometer to further check this out."
2,Temperature markings wiped off with a damp sponge,I bought this because Cooks Illustrated magazine rated it as the best over thermometer and I trust them. This had been in my oven for about 1 year when I decided the food splashes needed to be cleaned off because they were making it hard to read the numbers. I used a damp soapy sponge and wiped the face of the thermometer (it was cold).The temperature markings wiped right off!I didn't put this in the dishwasher or use an abrasive like Ajax. Just soap and a sponge. Now it has no numbers. Now it is useless.
1,Quit reading after just a month,Purchased after a test kitchen suggested. Was happy with till a month after I started using it had completely quit reading tempatures. Threw away and purchsed a different brand and style of thermometer.
1,Can't read anything,"No matter how or where I mount this thermometer, I can't tell what the temp is in my oven. I've got a squeaky clean window, so that isn't the problem. I've tried to put it as close to the window without being in the way of the food I'm cooking. I've tried it with the internal light on and off. I've tried different angles by bending the base. I even tried to rotate the thermometer glass (VERY carefully). No matter what I tried, I still can't read the darn thing. I guess I'll try a good old dial type next."
1,Lasted two weeks,"I purchased this thermometer on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated. At first, the thermometer noted that our oven was running 75 degrees cooler than what was indicated by the settings. This contradicted the results we could witness simply from observing the cooking process on various foods. Within two weeks of occasional use, the thermometer ""broke"" and the liquid would not move any longer. Despite the Cook's Illustrated recommendation, I have not replaced it and would caution prospective buyers to weigh the possibility of a cheaply manufactured product not performing before they purchase it themselves. If you purchase it locally, at least you'll have easy recourse should you need to replace it."
3,Some problems but a good basic thermometer,My thermometer came with half the liquid at the upper end of the tube; I was able to 'shake it down' like an old medical thermometer and it seems to work fine now. My impression is that it may be reading a little low (about 20 degrees). Good because the liquid is not mercury!
4,Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer,"I picked this one because it was easy to read, can hang on the rack, or place on the rack.The only thing bad about it was it can break easily if you are not careful. I broke the first one I received because I was baking many items and it got push off or smashed in the oven by the pans. It is best to remember to move the thermometer to a safe place in the oven if you are baking several things. ...like the bottom floor of the oven."
3,Just OK,"This thermometer is hard to read. By the time I read it, I've had the door open so long that the temp goes down. I am not sure whether to trust the thermometer or the dial on the oven."
2,Temperature markings wash off,"As with many other reviewers here, mine had baked-on grease and when I washed it the numbers washed off. A thermometer is not very useful if you can't read it.I bought it because of the Cooks Illustrated recommendation -- I guess that they never had to wash it off when they tested it. A big oversight on their part. I would choose a different thermometer."
1,poorly made,This thermometer is poorly made: It is impossible to read when it is in the oven unless the light and viewing angle are perfect. the glass thermometer can easily slide in the frame so it has to be calibrated every time it is used. Finally the temperature markings are not engraved and can be washed off if one tries to clean the face of the thermometer.
1,Had to return...twice,"Even though the description and photograph of this product indicates that it has both Centigrade and Fahrenheit, I was sent a Fahrenheit-only thermometer twice in a row. Whoever is pulling the product from the bin and putting it in the mailing box isn't doing their job properly. The good thing is that returning the product is fairly easy -- print the pre-paid label and ship it off."
2,Great until the first washing.,"This is a decent thermometer, until it is washed.The first time I washed it all the numbers, letters, and lines came off.I do agree with everyone that it was hard to read, but it does measure very well.c"
5,Impressive,"Until now I have always used oven thermometers with a glass front that eventually discolored or got food on them that baked on and wouldn't come off so you couldn't read the internal temp of the oven without opening the door all the way. This thermometer has large numbers, is easy to read and doesn't have a glass front that eventually clouds over. Price was reasonable, quality is great."
3,"Pretty good, except for two flaws...","The thermometer seems to be quite accurate. The biggest flaw is the numbers. As others have said, they come off very easily if you aren't careful. They could also be larger, and in a more contrasting color - when the metal tints from the heat, they're black on brown, for a low contrast. I bought this one because liquid devices are more accurate than bimetallic (dial) devices, but the most accurate thermometer can't help if you can't read it. The other flaw is that you can't tilt the thermometer. That means you'll have to bend the feet, depending on where you place the thermometer, until you have a good viewing angle. These folks need to get together with the guys at OXO who really seem to know how to design stuff for usability."
5,A stunning book,"Okay, so I haven't read the book but I've seen the pictures in it at least. Even if you have no interest in Renaissance Erotica you should buy this book just because it's written by one of *the* coolest professors at Ohio State. What better reason do you need?"
3,High maintenance,"I bought a set of these about 2 years ago. They are pretty, but they leave black marks from silverware. It is just too much work to clean them with the special porcelain cleaner every time there is a mark, which is every time you use silverware on them. Several of my dishes have chips out of them now. I'm searching for something different. I'm not sure if I should stay away from the Pfaltzgraff because of the easy black marking. These dishes are pretty but not worth the hassle to clean the marks off. I would not recommend them unless you don't plan on using silverware on them."
5,Great Dinnerware,The Pfaltzgraff Melissa 16 piece dinnerware set comes with the following:4 Large Plates4 Small Plates4 Coffee Cips4 BowlsThe pieces are nicely balanced and are of a solid construction making them durable for the long haul. The floral pattern design gives the dishes a dainty look that is appropriate for all occassions (save perhaps a Super Bowl party).
4,Very pretty everyday dinnerware,"I bought service for eight in this pattern about 2 years ago. Except for a couple plates that I dinged (I'm amazed my klutzy self hasn't broken anything!), everything has held up very well. I use these every day and they still look great. The silverware marks a previous reviewer noted can occur, but have been very light and uncommon - unnoticeable unless you're examining your plate in strong light. Everything is of a nice weight - not too thin, not too heavy. The pattern hasn't faded at all. I have bone china I received for my wedding, but this is perfect for common use and is pretty enough for casual entertaining. I love my set."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought a Pfaltzgraff dinnerware set in another white pattern two years ago. The comments about black utensil marks on the dishes are correct! We had only used our dishes for a few weeks when we first noticed them. After one year of use, the dishes looked ready for the 50 cent bin at a yard sale. No wonder Pfaltzgraff has to make their own cleaner! I have owned several dishes sets over the years and this is the first that has ever had this problem. My cutlery is high-end, by the way, so that is not the issue. Don't give yourself the grief of this product. To my great regret, when we purchased these dishes we bought another entire dinnerware set to replace breakages. Now I am stuck with both of them!"
5,Rock Solid,"Ten Thousand Fists is Disturbed's best album to date. In fact, it may be the best album that I've heard in the past 5 years.This is an amazing effort for Disturbed. Every track cuts deep like a razor, and there are many songs that are worthy of being released as singles. The album is full of jagged riffs and wicked solos, and they even have a cool Genesis cover tune thrown in that sounds fantastic.I wish it wasn't over after 14 tracks. If you are a Disturbed fan, you are in for a real treat. It's worth every penny."
2,Disturbed get exponentially worse with each album.,"Wow, this band just keeps pumping out the same nu-metal songs on each release. The Sickness was an all-right album, much better than anything Slipknot or Mudvayne could do. Then they're sophmore effort was bassically all the bad parts of The Sickness rolled into one. 10,000 Fists (how original) is nothing, but lame metal for the people over at MTV to play when they think they are playing some real metal. Go pick up the re-issue of Atheist's debut album Piece of Time, that should give you guys a lesson on what metal is all about. I will give it two stars just because the members are fans of Dimebag, a true metal legend."
2,dissapointing,Disturbed have lost there talent this cd sucks plain and simplethe title track is awesome and forgiven is good because of those to songs i give this a 2 other than that this is a 0 its sucks ass get Beleive and The Sickness download the title track and forgiven then go get some real metal like Slayer-Reign In Blood
1,Have not received Item,"As of today, June 27, I still have not received this item after being charged for it back in May."
1,these guys should be beaten...,"okay. the first album. not bad. the second album had one or two songs worth downloading. this one... well. you can tell the band was going for hit or miss, and they missed hard. this band sucks. If the band Chicago, grew some balls and took steroids, this is what they would be. i think that pretty much says it all."
4,Disturbed's best yet.?,"Another solid release from Disturbed, but a far cry from the diversity of ""Believe."" This is one of those album's you REALLY dig at first, but eventually just tires itself out. There is some great rock on here, but the album lacks the vibrant maturity of ""Believe."""
1,"The new album is amazing, the special edition is a waste of money","Let me begin my saying that this album is absolutely amazing. I'm a huge fan. I have all their stuff and see them every time they come to town. I think this album is the best metal to come out in the past few years. I just want people to save their money. I bought one of the special edition and one of the regular album. Believe had an extra dvd and art. The special edition only has extra art...NOTHING ELSE. Buy the regular album! The special edition is a COMPLETE WASTE...unless you love McFarlane's work. I feel a little cheated by this one. At least it's an outstanding album. Like I said, you'll love the album, but don't pay twice as much for packing and a few drawings! Just buy the regular disc."
5,Best Disturbed Album Yet!,"The Disturbed boys have grown up and evolved. This album is very political. Something that is necessary in light of current affairs. David's voice is pristine, as always, and full of heart-wrenching emotion. The songs are clean, crisp, and heavy. This is the perfect mixture of The Sickness and Believe. Buy it NOW!"
5,GREAT THIRD ALBUM RELEASE!,"IF YOU LIKED THE LAST TWO ALBUMS DISTURBED PUT OUT,""THE SICKNESS"" AND ""BELIEVE"",YOU DEFINITELY WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.THIS ALBUM STILL HAS THE HARD SOUND OF THE FIRST TWO ALBUMS,AND THE GREAT MELODIC METAL YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THE GROUP.THEIR COVER SONGS ARE ALWAYS A NICE BONUS TO THEIR OWN WRITTEN SONGS.""LAND OF CONFUSION"" FROM GENESIS,THAT WAS A GREAT SONG IN ITSELF,DAVID DRAIMAN DID WITH PERFECTION.IN FACT,THERE IS NOT A BAD SONG ON THIS ALBUM,MUCH LIKE THEIR OTHER ALBUMS.CAN YOU TELL I'M A BIG FAN OF THIS GROUP?THEY CONTINUE TO GROW WITH THEIR LYRICS AND MUSIC,AND ARE DEFINITELY HERE TO STAY.ALSO,CHECK OUT GODSMACK'S NEWEST FULL ALBUM ""FACELESS"".THESE TWO GROUPS ARE ON THE TOP OF THEIR GAME."
4,It's Disturbed...What more is there to say..,"I have been listening to Disturbed for more than a few years now (long enough to pass the love on to my son)And I was not disappointed with this CD. They are still killer.The songs are still raw and full of feeling...what more can I say, they rock."
5,Better with every album,"Disturbed has really grown into a great metal band, the first album was great, their 2nd was even better and now, they're tearing up the music scenes of today! With this 3rd installment they've have gotten musically better then ever before and vocally better aswell, I heard just the beginning parts of ""Guarded"" a month ago and just by that beginning part I was hooked and wanting more, this is truly there best album and you should expect their 4th album to be even better with a great band who has grown up since they began. Strongly Recommended"
5,ONLY TEN THOUSAND?,"If that's the case, then this cd needs to be put back in the vault, cause obviously the world was not ready for this album. Or is it because there is nothing hollywood about Disturbed.*NEWSFLASH: YOUR FAVORITE HOLLYWOOD D!CK-HUMPING RADIO STATION HAS JUST BECOME OBSOLETE.*In my opinoin Disturbed just crushed every single band on the planet, AGAIN, for years to come. Hell ""The Sickness"" is still makin people choke. To sum it all up: Definate legends, and looking forward to a another."
4,4 years in the making!,let me say its about time! this cd is great its a mix of the sickness and believe. it was worth the 4 year wait welcome back disturbed!
5,a huge improvement for disturbed,"I wasnt a disturbed fan before this album, but I heard the song ""Land of Confusion"" on the radio and i had to get another taste of the band. I got this CD and was immediately blown away by it. This album is so much better than the other albums by disturbed. It's just that the quality of the music has improved so much, the songs ""Land of Confusion"", ""Deify"", and ""10,000 Fists"" i would automaticly give 5 stars to. ""Forgiven"" and ""Son of a Plunder"" would get at leats 4 stars each. An amazing CD, dont be turned off by other disturbed CDs."
4,Very good.,"But not anything that hasn't been done before.Disturbed's third major-label release is actually quite good. It takes the best from both previous albums (The Sickness and Believe), and puts them together for a sound that is dark, yet melodic, sinister, yet harmonious. There is only one problem: There is no progression. The band hasn't really evolved their sound in any way, they've just taken concepts from their previous works and glued them together. Which leads to the problem of repetion. The first half of the album is very good, and not to say that the second half is horrific, but it's just very bland. It all begins to sound the same. The songs aren't necessarily bad, just repetitive.Good, but there's room for improvement."
3,"Good, album, but repetative.","Here is a nice short review for all to see. If you like disturbed, and are already into them, than this is a must have for you. If you only like a few songs from disturbed, or just getting into them, buy the first album and that is all you need to get your fix. No real groundbreaking work on this album, nice to see a cover tune again (land of confusion) because the band select ones that lend themselves well to the disturbed style. Also, thank you disturbed for finding a few guitar solos again. Enough with the constant machine grind, it's nice to have it broken up once in a while, then launch back into the pit. Semi reminiscent of old school metal at times. Overall, good album, but not a great album."
3,Disturbed Goes SOFT (lyrically),"What's most interesting is how a band with as much supposed attitude and edge can be so freaking SOFT. Not the music, which is hard and edgy (although as others have pointed out, monotonous by track 6). No, it's with the lyrics.Here's Dave, screeching in his usual gravelly voice, that he's all scared of the big, bad Republicans. And that we had better stop liberating countries or else the apparently less bad (how does that work??) terrorists are gonna put us in some real pain.How quickly they forget the terrorists hit us first.I never picked Dave for one of those guys who gets hit with a left hook and turns the other cheek so he talk out his feelings. But I guess that all part of the pussification of America.The music gets a 4.The lyrics get a 2.Hey Dave, try being a man and write some butt-kicking lyrics to go with the butt-kicking music."
5,Special edition totally worth it.,"I bought the special edition of TTF a couple months back and I've got to say, it ROCKS!! The graphic designs are awesome and it's not a matter look at the pictures once then never again. Nearly every time I get out the CD I have to sit down and look at the art. I suppose I appreciate it even more being rather artistic myself, but really speaking I think most people would enjoy it. My favourite picture is the hooded guy on the back page with his ripped clothing and chains, I liked it so much that I've been trying to redraw it but it's pretty hard because of the type of paper it's on. Anyway, my point is, if it's just music you're after buy the normal CD, but I think the special edition is completely worth and it doesn't cost that much more than the normal CD."
3,revisted of 80's hits,"I like what they did here in revisiting 80's hits but I think that they have the talent base to make they're own music and not revamping existing tracks. I do love ""Land of Confusion""."
3,disturbed,"disturbed is an excellent band, but i have only heard this album 1 time. i have purchased it 2 times and i have had a problem with these 2 copies. both times i have bought it and put it in all my cd players, ps2, and computers, it wouldnt play the disc. i am dissapointed in the fact that this has happened 2 times with 2 different brand new unscratched copies. so i am gonna give it a 3."
2,Not at all as good as the previous 2...,"Disturbed's last two albums both demonstrated more musical range and sincere ability. Granted, this album may be considered a better real metal album, it is certainly lacking in diversity. To begin with, 8 or 9 of the songs sound very similar to one another.Also, there are only 2 or 3 really good rock tracks on here; in their prior albums, I would occasionally listen from start to finish but with this cd, there is no chance of that.If you are somehow new to disturbed, dont be tricked by this lame offering, go pick up believe and the sickness."
4,Disturbed still trying to stay popular.,"I've read some reviews of this album. One says he can't play it on any cd players, ps2, e.t.c, one said they suck because they gotten worse with the music and lyrics, one says there the same as the last two albums, one says they suck for having politics in it.In the end. Everyone has there likes and dislikes. One prefers to have a bunny lyric cd to ""get away"" from having a straight in your face cd giving you a idea of what's happening today. Disturbed's last two albums were alright that's why i made a mix cd of the two albums Believe and The Sickness. I do agree they haven't changed with there form from the last two albums. One was heart pounding and turn up your stereo, the other was more easyback concintrating on the lyrics. In this pecticular album. They decided to combine both forces. I was interested in the album after listening to deify. I think for new listeners download or buy the last two albums before taking a peek at this one.Overall rating: 4 Stars"
3,Disturbed pulls an Offspring,"To be frank, this is a mediocre album. From ""Just Stop"" to ""Sons of Plunder"" to ""Pain Redefined"" all the songs have the same sound. They really don't make an effort to do anything new except on the Genesis cover of ""Land of Confusion."" When I heard it I was simply amazed, metal bands normally don't cover old rock songs, especially so well. The cover almost is as good as the original (similiar to Hendrix's ""All Along Watchtower"" and Nirvana's ""Where Did you Sleep Last Night?"") And the second and last decent song, ""Ten Thousand Fists"", is a very fast song worthy of having the album named after. Otherwise the album as a whole is a disapointment. I dare anyone to listen to any song, starting in the middle, (for the exception of Land of Confusion and Ten Thousand Fists) and be able to name the song."
3,The Sickness,"What happened to them? I ain't gonna hate, but seriously if you want this click the used button and buy it that way... these guys are beyond where they were and on something new. I am not saying it is bad, but some old school fans may not be ""getting down with 10,000 fists"""
2,Yawn.,"This is my second Disturbed album and I have reached the conclusion that they're just not that good of a band. All the songs sound pretty much the same and there's nothing really appealing about any of them--not the riffs, hooks, melodies, nothing. TTF is a collection of one moderately competent (but dull) song after another. Maybe they need to fire their guitar player(s) and bring in someone with a little more creative energy. Not recommended."
1,"In the immortal words of Jim Norton: ""Awful! It just stinks!""","One word: horrendous.OK, more than one word ... what has happened to these guys? This has to be the most uninspired writing I've ever heard. Puh-lease.I've actually listened to this disc a number of times and each time I do, it gets worse and worse.I wish I could give this zero stars."
1,For the person who thought Land of Confusion was there song,"Ok first off, dont even try to flame me. This is to InIcedFlames, who thinks that Disturbed wrote this song, The song Land of Confusion, WAS NOT WRITTEN BY THEM. It was a song written by Genesis in 1986. So if anyone thinks that they wrote this song, ITS NOT THEM."
2,Since when did Phil Collins become cool?,"When I heard the Disturbed version of ""Land of Confusion"" I thought it might be from a Genisis tribute CD. Key kids, it's Phil Collins! Dork rock."
1,All the same,"This is the first material i have ever listened to by this band. To me this album pretty much sucks....every song sounds the same,the style of music on this CD sounds like a faster paced, more aggressive VAN HALEN....I am going to give this band another chance and pick up some of theyre earlier releases....BUT as for this album.........IT BITES THE BIG ONE!"
2,Why include politics in hard rock music?,"I genuinely love hard rock/punk music. Day in and day out I simply cannot stand hearing these (...)rock dudes talking politics like they know what it is like! I USED to love Disturbed for their hard rock riffs and killer drum beats but I have to lay their cd down, preferably in front of my car tire, and walk away from this one. If you're in a band shut the hell up about politics. It only pisses people off like me who enjoy the finer things in like such as politics. Disturbed went from rocking out (on Stupify), to a voice of `ten thousand fists.' I went from loyal fan, to their foe after hearing this new piece of crap."
2,Disappointed,"Disturbed was one of the greatest metal bands in existence. And then this album came out. It's like a cross between 80's hair metal and the Rocky soundtrack. Almost like Creed or Alterbridge or other crappy groups.I can only hope that they return to their old sound in the next album. Until then, I smell sell-out."
4,Pretty Good Album,"I first discovered Disturbed while playing Guitar Hero 3. The song was ""Stricken"". After listening to this whole album, my favorite song is still ""Stricken"" - kick ass song! The album is very good, the only negative thing I can think of is that the songs kind of sound similar to each other. But don't get me wrong, it is a good buy."
4,Great album,Kick @$$ album. This is one of my favorite albums to listen to driving the hundred miles round trip to work. Very glad I got it.
4,Good Solid Metal,"Best Disturbed album so far, as far as I'm concerned. Real solid metal. Guarded is an absolute classic song. I love this kind of music, but after 14 songs it starts to sound a bit the same. Maybe Distubed felt the same way and came with the idea to put a cover on the cd as well... Wrong choice. The cover ""Land Of Confusion"" is absolutely not necessary in my opinion. Sound like the original, just a bit louder, nothing special.So; if you're into this kind of stuff you're going to love it. If you're looking for something special listen to the cd before you buy it..."
5,listen to stupify and then you will..,"know to buy this album, they'reeeeeeeeeeee bbbbaaaaaaaaaacccccccckkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!i'v been waiting my Hole wLife for just one bleep. go get this or order it now you disturbed ""renagades. RAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Ten Thousand Fists,"Great headache reliever! What? You don't believe me? It's true... Whenever I have a headache, I listen to this album and my headache doesn't come back for the rest of the day. Tell me that's not awesome.Yeah, that's what I thought. Now go buy this awesome album. =D"
2,Mediocre at best,"I'm a a bit disappointed in this album. ""The Sickness"" was so innovative and every song was different. 10,000 fists just sounds the same, song after song. The good news is that I've rediscovered ""The Sickness"" all over again and can rock out once again with a truly great album, even if it's several years old."
3,"Nothing too entirely new, dissapointed by reviews previous to my purchase","This album is very similiar to everything else I've heard from Disturbed, but nothing catches the ears as you would like it to. Don't get me wrong, the album is an all rock-out-throw-your-fist-in -the-air (as the title suggests) musical endeavour, but nothing is That great as I was led to think before I bought it. For those who like Disturbed, it's in their alley, for others, preview the tracks, listen to it from friends or others (or find another way to hear it...I am Not, repeat, Not encouraging illegal downloading, lol) to find out if it is right for you."
3,Grunge still rules,"This cd is mediocre at best. I gave it a ""3"" to be generous, but it really lacks any growth from there previous 2 records. There are a couple decent songs like the title track and stricken, but the majority of these songs really sound the same and frankly lack any creativity. I thought there first cd was great and even somewhat refreshing at the time, but they have not evolved and grown at all with there sound on Beleive and this record. My advice is to wait a few weeks and pick it up used for 5 or 6 bucks."
1,Boring effort.,"Was hoping for a return to kick arse music, but after listening several times, I find im just bored. All the songs sound the same, and none really stick out. Disturbed's first two albums were by far better than this one. Seems like they were more interested in getting out a message album (about their dislike for bush, war, etc), and less about rocking. Go back to writing about girls, it makes for better songs."
1,what happened....!?,"i had been pumped up for this release for months and was all kinds of crazy when i got my grubby little hands on it. usually, i'm not crazy about a CD through the first listen, i have to give it a few times through, and generally it sits in the car's player for about a week at least. not this one!the first thing that jumped out at me was that 3/4 of the songs, i had heard before. they seemed to take the same riffs and music, and just re-did the lyrics. so, i was quickly bored with the CD.my other complaint, for a title of ""Ten Thousand Fists"" i was expecting, just like the previous releases, to have something that was going to make me want to jump up, punch some windows out and put my head through a wall. this album did not inspire me at all. nothing, nada, zip, zilch.this works for the die-hard Disturbed fan. other then that, pass, not worth it. i was disappointed."
1,this no good,"hi, i su ling wong from china. i just like to say disturbed is no good band. i think benji madden and good charlotte is much more of talented band. you must lisen to good charlotte or link park for good good very good metal. disturbed in no metal. disturbed is pop-rock, like dimeboy and pantera/damageplan. please buy ""fallen"" instead, it is much more of metal music. i <3 benji madden."
4,predictable but good,"the only problem i have ever had with this band is their desire to add keyboards for no reason when songs dont friggin need it. not only doe it sound unnecessary, but it sounds cheesy.. but other than that, another really good album from a band that has a GREAT album in them. Just need to go heavier and without the lame keyboards that are atempting to add melody to songs that dont need it.."
5,Freakin Awesome,"This is my first Disturbed Cd. This seems to be the only Cd I've listened to since I got it a week ago, the songs on here are catchy and addictive such as Striken and Guarded. It's not that the others songs are bad it's just that these two caught my attention the most. Another good thing about this band is that do not repeat the same lyrics over and over and over which shows their ability to write original and unique songs."
4,nice,I am a huge fan and this album is a must. Several great songs with a few okay at best songs. Well worth the price for a whole album verus the price for just the hits.
3,A Good Album -- But Not The Sickness,"For those of you Disturbed fans out there, you will like this album but don't expect it to be another ""The Sickness"". If you go to one of Disturbed's concerts during this tour, David says that the fist is a symbol of power and defiance which is what this entire album is about.If you're like me and sick of the political rhetoric (ala Green Day), whether it be on the left or the right in music then you will be disappointed in this album. I wish they would have generalized it more instead of making it anti-Bush but nonetheless its what it's about specifically under their fourth track, Deify.There are several good songs on this album including Ten Thousand Fists, Stricken, Guarded and Sons of Plunder but it seems like a wash because of Disturbed's turn towards one of the ""political"" bands."
2,Such a waste...,"Shades of KORN's ""Untouchables""...Right down to the artwork...David Draiman must have been lazy...""Believe"" is the watermark that this band must push past...They have it within them...Let's see if they can do it...Save for a few tracks,Ten Thousand Fists ain't it..."
3,It would be ranked higher if they left all the Bush bashing out,I really used to love this band but the political lyrics are a big turn off. If I knew about the lyrics ahead of time I wouldn't have bought the cd. On the band's web site the lead singer talks about how anti-war he is and then says he likes it that soldiers listen to his music to get charged up before going into combat. The guy is a joke and his politics are just the old worn-out Michael Moore crap. Bottom line is that the politics ruined this cd.
2,Not even worth the $10 I paid for it...,"I've read some reviews for this product and thought to myself, did we listen to the same CD? How can anyone recommend such a horrible album to anyone? Disturbed's reign ended with their second album, which had only two great songs on it- Prayer and Liberate. If you like this CD, you are severely musically malnourished."
1,At least they tried,"Unlike many other nu metal bands out there that ultimately wind up sounding too repetitive, Disturbed added more guitar solos to its repetoir, yet my problem is that this album still sounds way too much like their other albums, same singing technique, average drumming and bassing, and basically the same guitar riffs with added solos that are not too impressive.But my biggest grievance has to be................that they are the headliners at ozzfest."
1,oh boy,I think every 13 year old girl in the world shares your view Mike. And saying that the metal I listen to is just screaming and slamming chords??? You have a lot to learn my friend. But I can't blame you. I think you are one of those 13 year old girls.
1,This isn't metal. It's pure garbage,"How long can you uneducated, angsty, teenybopper, morons continue to listen to garbage like this. The only genius in this music is that they've managed to fool you idiots for so long into thinking that each song they produce is actually new. If you had any wits about you, you'd be able to hear that every dippy little track this band puts out is comprised of about 3 chords spread out over three cds! You all need to be beat upside the head.I love the list of albums that other people bought.1. Godsmack2.Korn3. drowning pool4.stained5.stinkin parkYou kiddies need to listen to real metal. But you wouldn't know about that sort of stuff because they don't play it on the radio. hahaahaa."
4,I only received a box of 3 not 6 as I paid for,"I only received a case of 3 , not 6 as advertised. I hope they can send me the other 3 as i PAID FOR THEM"
2,not my favorate,this didn't work for me as well as i hoped it would. But its ok. It somewhat does the job.
4,These things help a lot!,"Lobe Wonder is something I now can't live withiout! I try to buy light-weight earrings so that almsot 30 yr old piercing wholes won't get tugged when I do wear heavy ones, but this isn't always possible.Am so very pleased to have found a solution.It isn't perfect in EVERY Way: you have to pay attention, but you can save lobe pulling and tearing with Lobe Wonder, and it's well worth the investment!"
4,EXCELLENT SUPPORT FOR EAR LOBES,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2 YRS. I WEAR PIERCED EARRINGS AND MY LOBES HAD BECOME STRETCHED FROM WEARING HEAVY EARRINGS AND ASWERING THE TELEPHONE A LOT. LOBE WONDER HAS STOPPED THE STRETCHING. THEY ARE EASY TO USE AND CONVENIENT TO CARRY ALONG WITH YOU ANYWHERE.THANKS!!! LOBE WONDER FOR BEING A GREAT PRODUCT.
4,Works well,The product work well with heavy earrings or for torn lobes. The adhesive keep the patch in place.
3,My Opinion,The product is ok for people with a stretched earlobe but it tends to come off if you have a split earlobe.
5,Uh-May-Zing,"I will never be without this product. I love big earrings! Before I bought Lobe Wonder my left ear would bleed by Thursday. I know it's crazy to even let your ear get to this point, but I have some great jewelry. With Lobe Wonder I do not even know I have an earring in EVER, not even the slightest pain. Buy this product you will not regret it."
5,Works like advertised!,Having one hole partially torn has meant not wearing heavy earrings for years. These take care of the problem and now I wear whatever earrings I wish without the fear of further ripping.
2,Gift recipient not happy,"I bought these for my mom at her request. Unfortunately, she says they do not support the ear as advertised."
4,Ear Lobe Support Patches,"I've had pierced ears since I was six and have always had a fondness for big earrings. However, the earrings and years haven't been good to my ear lobes which have stretched.As a result, for many years, I had begun to avoid big earrings for fear of further stretching. The ear lob support patches have enabled me to begin wearing my favorite earrings again and have greatly improved the appearance of my ear lobes."
5,Best Product Out There!,"I love this product. They actually stick to your ear, even after you shower with them. If you are looking for something effective, look no more - this is it. I bought four boxes because I don't want to be without them. My earlobes droop when I wear heavy earrings, but not when I use them with this product. Lobe Wonder will protect your earlobes from all the wear and tear of wearing heavy earrings. I am very satisfied customer. : )"
1,Lobe Wonder Rip-off,The Lobe Wonder Ear Repair is way too expensive. The same product can be purchased for less than half the price if you shop around. I won't be back. :(
3,earlobes solution but not a fixer,"if you have big earlobe holes because you used heavy earing then this product is perfect for you. However if you in the past have had plugs and now what to seal your ear holes then this product helps you to wear earings but it will not makes your earholes smaller. I had size 0 plugs and size 8 plugs on top of that, Because of the carrer I decited on I can not use plugs so I took them out. My earholes have gotten smaller but are not seal, I use this product so that I can wear earing and it works fine. But I just want to let everyone know that this product helps but it is not a solution or a ""fixer"" of you large earlobe holes."
5,LOVE THESE!,"I Love these ingenious little things! I wouldn't be able to wear any other than extremely lightweight earrings if it weren't for these wonderful ""reinforcements"" for earlobes. And they arrived quickly, too."
4,good book,Had more about meat than I cared to know. but contains information to produce authentic Indian meals.
1,"Much promise, does not deliver","This is what I was looking for - a digital meat themometer to use when cooking pork and hamburger on my grill. Unfortunately, the response of the readings was incredibly slow. How slow? Try going to 160 starting at 115, counting by .5 degrees every two seconds...115, 116, 117, 118, etc. If you have about 8 minutes to spend getting a reading on each peice of meat, then this is the unit for you. I checked the unit using boiling water to make sure it wasn't my meat that was the problem, same thing.The only plus is that is has batteries included and info printed on it for various meats and temps.If you want close to instant readings, get a different unit. I'm sending my back."
3,"Garden Time Organic Semolina Elbows, 12-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)",Not the best macaroni out there but it's extremely difficult to find organic elbow macaroni (non whole grain) and the only place I could find was on Amazon. Whole Foods used to carry an excellent organic elbow macaroni but stopped a while back. This is a relatively expensive pasta given it only has 12 oz (instead of 16 oz) in each pack.
4,Product was good,I ordered this item as a gift for my mother who does water aerobics. She says the belt works well and it is exactly what she wanted. The only problem was when I got the item the box it was shipped in was pretty bent up. Luckily the belt was fine and my mom isn't picky about what I wrap the gift in.
4,Keeps a big girl floating,"This belt is light but powerful, I weigh over 200 lbs and it keeps me floating in the deep end. It is easy to use and adjust. My only complaint is that it slips up a bit, so I put it below my tummy a little. It is light, easy to dry and It clips easily onto the handle of my swimming bag."
5,Great product,If you want a great workout this is it. Great for water exercises - nice wide belt - very comfortable. Shipped fast and well packaged. Would highly recommend.
1,Laughably Bad,What an abject waste this dvd is. The scenes are so poorly conceived and edited that it's like a parody of a destination video. We especially enjoyed the scene wherein the shot lingers on guy in beach chair long enough to watch him try to slap a bug off of his leg.I'd give this no stars if I could. Tivo something off of the Travel Channel!
1,"decent game, nothing special.","just like the first 2 this is a decent game worth playing once and that is it. nothing makes this game great or memorable, but it's cheap and you get to shoot things, so it's worth a few bucks. 2 stars."
5,Hurrah! for GI Joe,"This is a top grade documentary. Great care has obviously gone into its production; the visuals and sound track are excellent. I would highly recommend it- particularly to anyone with an interest in GI JOE, but I also think that it has wide appeal for all adults and children. The interviews with Joe's creators and the stories they tell are fascinating and touching. The vintage TV commercials and promotional films will give anyone who grew up in the 60's pangs of nostalgia. It will also give the children of today a rare glimpse into the time when their parents and grandparents were children. This is an upbeat, entertaining and informative film about an American icon and the heroes that made him possible."
3,Corrections are available,"Corrections for the patterns in the book are available at the Storey Publishers website:[...]There are a LOT of them: 7 of the 15 patterns have corrections and they run to 3 pages when you print them. The number of corrections to the ""Carrot Top"" bunny hat are astounding. Did anyone edit this book?That said, there are some very cute hats in this book."
3,"Fun, but not essential","I generally avoid ""trendy"" knitting, as I have been knitting since the age of 9 and would rather never touch any yarns with ""fun"" on the label, so I viewed this book with great skepticism. That being said, it's cute. Not deep, not challenging, but cute. There's a variety of hats, and even a lesson on double-knitting, so it doesn't cater only to the novice knitter. I made 2 hats exactly as written--one I am very pleased with & one I am not overly pleased with--and used another pattern as a jumping-off point to design my own hats, which turned out great. One hat is knit on straight needles for those who are reticent about trying dpns, but the best bet is to jump in & try circular knitting--it would be FAR easier.Not the best book in the world, but it's worth adding to the ""fluff"" section of your knitting library."
3,Cute but not an essential book on hats,"This is an adorable book--die cut to look like a stocking hat. And there is enough variety to please most knitters, with headbands, toques, berets and such. I found the designs less than inspiring, but the patterns can be adapted to your own tastes. In short, not an essential book, but a great gift for a knitter, and a good book to have if you like a lot of hat patterns on hand."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"I thought the patterns in this book were hideous. It contained absolutely nothing that I would wear or would want to knit for anyone else. There wasn't a single hat that caught my eye. I think this was a complete waste of my money. I would recommend Cathy Carron's Hip Knits Hat, a book that I absolutely loved. I also wish Nicky Epsteins' hat book was still in print (or that she would release another). As far as this book goes, unless you are planning on knitting for a very young kid who might be able to pull off one of these awful patterns (small kids can be charming that way), pass on this one."
3,Slim Pickings,"It is true that this is the apex of the study of Hank Williams, and Colin Escott did an outstanding job turning over every stone that might still be in existence. However, Escott's writing style is a little clumbsy and I often had to revert to re-reading the text to follow his structure. Great research, but the writing could have been better."
4,hank unvarnished,"this is a comprehensive and unflinching account of the life of one of our truly seminal singer/songwriters.a very great deal of research went into this, the density of which is sometimes daunting, but always rewarding.but the work is not a treatise, and it's as gut wrenching as it is thought provoking. i found myself thinking about the nature of destiny and the nature of enduring greatness, as embodied in the songs of this flawed and conflicted man. i read it in two days and it will stay with me in one way or another for the rest of my life. as will hank's music. 4 stars if you've never heard of hank williams, 5 if you have."
4,Facts about Ole Hank!,"You only wish you knew somebody that said great things like, ""If you think I'm a drunk, you shoulda seen my oldman"". I don't like the glamorization of drug and alcohol abuse but I think that's pretty funny.I always liked Hank Williams music and felt like he was the real deal. He sang from the heart in a way that you knew what he was talking about. I was glad I picked up this book and learn more about him. I have to say it seems that Colin Escott and company got facts that they can back up. In reading this you respect the people that were good to Hank Williams and get a sour taste for the people that exploited him. You admire his accomplishments and hated to see his failures.Great book that highlights the brilliance of Hank Williams!"
3,it's solid but that's about all...,"Fun game if you are really into robots. If not, there are so many better platformers available (Super Castlevania IV, Super Star Wars, Demon Crest) But it's really not a bad game, just nothing to write home about. For someone who likes games in general, who isn't real picky, you would enjoy it."
4,Rogue gets her own limited series,"This book tells a great story about one of the more mysterious X-Men, Rogue. Gambit, Bella Donna, and Rogue's first love, Cody, play integral parts in this wonderful tale. The art is also nice, too. You should check out the Gambit trade also so that you can get the entire storyline this book represents."
4,john peel delivers again,"Why not 5 stars? This album seems like a bit of a jumble, the band is not very tight, and I don't think it adequately represents their body of work. But its still a solid album promoted on the Strange Fruit label, and if you're a fan of their studio work, you'll enjoy it.Not sure why the track listings are missing up above, but the tracks are as follows:1. purple haze2. man without qualities II3. jaggerbog4. big5. get better6. part 47. man without qualities I"
3,A worth while read,"The book is a great step toward community. What Randy Fazee is writing about is not how to start a small group ministry or about church growth, instead he is describing how Pantego Bible Church is intentionally working at authentic Christian community. For that alone, I think the book is worth while reading.There are good examples and well thought out strategy accompanied by a good analysis of American culture. I agree with the overall cultural analysis but it seemed overly nostalgic at times, remembering back to the good old days when the world was a better place to live in. I remember Socrates complaining about a similar situation in Ancient Greece.The book also does not address what different challeges there might be if one tried authentic community in an urban and multiethnic setting. This is to be expected since the Pantego Bible Church is a suburban church.All that said, the book is on the right track."
1,sniffy,Horrible experience with this one. I bought this for my class and when the time came to work from it the SD was missing.
1,Horrible,"Not only did they estimate the ship date would be late. But I never even got the merchandise. Unreliable people, and I will be sure to never do any kind of purchase from them."
4,Sniffy Review,I am very happy with the product. The book is in great condition. I didn't realize however that the CD was not included with the book.
5,a MUST for every coach!!,"Definitely one of the best buys I've had!! The OverSpeed DVD goes in detail demonstrating the different OverSpeed exercises and the physiological adaptations that will make the athlete increase his/her speed. Furthermore, specific soccer goalkeeper drills are demonstrated.You will not regret getting this DVD after you have seen the results the OverSpeed method brings. All coaches interested in improving the speed of your athletes for any sport should definitely get this DVD."
1,Is this the same book?,"Having bought and read this book, I wonder if my copy does not belong to some alternative reality. The previous reviewers have commented on historical aspects of the story and character developement. Well, the authors knowledge of english social history at the time (1810) is so bad as to be non-existant. For a start a single man would have instantly employed a chaperone when acquiring a female ward of marriagable age, and once an unmarried woman became a mistress she would not have been received in society, she certainly would not have become friends with a Peeress. On a plus point the book did make me laugh though that was probaly not the reaction looked for. If you want fluff, sort of Barbara Cartland with sex, this is for you, if you want history read something else."
4,Nice collection of classic stories and art,"This collection is fairly extensive, with several books, all of which are pretty long compared to stories in other collections. What my toddler loves most are the illustrations, especially the early 1950s style of ""Baby Dear.""Each story is presented as a separate book, making for easy breaks in reading. The only complaint I have about the collection is that it is almost too heavy for young children to carry around and read on their own. Unfortunately some of these books are not available on their own and if you want a copy, this is a nice way to have one.Contents are:The Poky Little PuppyBaby DearThe Color KittensGood Night Little BearThe Wonderful HouseThe Friendly BookThe Three BearsThe Sailor DogThe Boy and the TigersI Can FlyThe Sleepy BookHow The Turtle Got Its Shell"
2,Waste your money in something else,"This cd is bad, and I really mean it. I've got it as a gift and use it when I want to drive somebody nuts, be it myself or somebody else. Waste your money in something else!"
5,Nice Little Thermometer,"Nothing fancy here. Just a basic thermometer for your freezer or refrigerator. Works quite well, and is easy to read (although sometimes you'll need to wipe off ice build-up or sweat to read the digits)."
5,Works,I got 4 of these 2 for me 2 for my girlfriend. I put all 4 in the frig then in the freezer and the all read the same so they are all off the same amount or they all work perfectly. I go with works great. Great price too.
1,Broken on arrival,"The thermometer I received had air bubbles in the alcohol column, and I could not get them out using the enclosed troubleshooting directions. I returned it to Amazon, with no problem."
3,They serve their purpose,Nothing to get excited about. They serve the purpose of monitoring the temperatures in our back-up refrigerator / freezer. My only complaint is that they have to be viewed at an extremely exact angle to get a reading.
3,Disappointed,I opened the packed and found that the game had not been cleaned. It is very dirty. And I am very disappointed
5,I'm moving to Alaska,"Microbe has enough about the really deadly germs out in the environment to give you a serious case of the shivers! For the most part, it's a thrilling read with a sober side of analysis on how we're relying more on luck and the hope that the right doctor at the right time is watching out for us.My favorite example of the latter is in the chapter on the mysterious 1993 hantavirus outbreak in New Mexico. A cool medical 'whodunnit' or 'what-dunnit' with a race against time to figure out what was killing healthy people living out in the wilds of the state. You get the sense that humanity as a whole really dodged a bullet on that one.This goes on my shelf next to 'The Andromeda Strain' and 'Demon in the Freezer', both also great books."
5,MICROBE,"I found MICROBE to be very well written, easy to read, interesting, and very informative. It helped me to put my limited information into perspective. The book helped me to understand such serious subjects as the bird flu, the mad cow disease, the realities of biological warfare, and the social aspects of dealing with an epidemic. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to better understand the realities and risks associated with the potential for a deadly epidemic."
5,"""Relativism""--A new assult on the postmodern position","The many argument strategies given by Frank and Greg are not just successfull in conversations, but conversation stoppers! Great witnessing techniques. Appreciated the emphasis on traditional rhetoric, Socratic method, and question-asking skills. They teach one to control the conversation by prying open the mind of the relativist with clear logic. I would recommend this book for all pastors and christian educators. Further, this book ought to be considered by college/seminary professors as a classroom text. Fantastic work, easy to read and has impacted my life personally."
3,"Strong on examples, weak on philosophy","All in all, this is a pretty good book, particularly for those with no background in formal philosophical arguments and theories or apologetics. Anyone who has done even minimal reading in philosophy and apologetics may find it a little dull. Honestly, all of the philosophical arguments are better stated and in greater needed detail in Lewis' Mere Christianity, which the authors quote often (Mere Christianity is still the most accessible text on both moral and Christian philosophy). Still, the modern examples and illustrations, while revealing the authors' own leanings, adequately serve to make the points desired."
5,"""I've fallen and I can't get up"", said the relativist","The authors have done a great job in exposing the inconsistent nature of relativistic thinking. They point out that relativism has taken hold in a society (ours) that is unable to critically examine itself, and where self-interest and pleasure shape ethical decisions. Many relativists like to pass themselves off as tolerant and neutral folk (tolerant of everyone except those who hold an absolutist viewpoint, that is), but as Beckwith and Koukl point out, ""the only place of true neutrality is silence"". Throughout the book they explain the self-refuting nature of relativism; that is, it's merely absolutism in sheep's clothing. This book will be valuable for anyone looking to stand against the flood of subjectivism that currently rules the societal roost (mixed metaphors notwithstanding)."
1,Christian ethics have evolved over the centuries,"Christianity does not provide any absolute guidance for moral behaviour. In Geneva Calvin burnt Servetus at the stake and had a child beheaded for disrespecting his parents. No doubt modern christians would find this abhorrent behaviour yet there is biblical justification for this.Here is a shocking passage from Revelation attributed to Christ:""tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols......I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD....""Obviously there is nothing wrong with killing children for the sins of their parents yet christians find abortion to be an abominable?No doubt 150 years ago Koukl and Beckwith would have been providing an ardent theological defence of slavery."
3,"Acceptable introduction, but repetitive","If you know next to nothing about relativism read this book; however, for those with a solid grasp on the concepts behind it, you'll find the authors making all the obvious points. They also tend to repeat things over and over, as if they're trying to reinforce all the arguments in your mind. Interesting examples are peppered throughout the work, though sometimes they seem a bit cherry picked. Go for Kreeft's ""A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews With an Absolutist"" for a more thorough and provocative read."
4,relativism: scapegoat for a darkened mind,"A good book. I agree with the prior post that some of the arguments could have been fleshed out better. Moral relativism is the philosophy underlying our current cultural degredation. It is deeply ensconsed in the depths of every romantic comedy movie, most sitcoms, and the rhetoric of radical socialist politicians. It is a wise person who has the discernment to identify and repudiate such a clearly illogical, and personally detrimental philosphy. This book will help in that quest.(..)For the full story of Servetus read this article: http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?457In regards to the passage in Revelation, (...) applies to contextual understanding of the passage, and clearly shows a non-understanding of the text. But, if truth is relative (...), why do you care whether Calvin and Jesus condone murder? A prime example of the conflicted state of relativism."
5,"If you say the authors are wrong, you prove their thesis!","Beckwith and Koukl firmly refute relativism and many self-defeating positions liberals take on current cultural issues. In fact, if you think these authors are absolutely wrong, you prove their point . . . you're really saying they're absolutely right! Not just for Christians, this is for every American concerned about our crumbling culture."
1,atrocious book on noxious publisher,A crime to have cut trees for this tripe. Poor grammar; confusuing; gossipy gushing; zero insights into their business affairs; zero facts on thier affairs & escapades; packed with trivial facts
4,great seat,"just purchased 2 of these seats for our 3 year old, great seat, easy to set up, he likes it and said its comfortable."
5,TurboBooster,My son loves this booster seat. It fits comfortably and safely in our car with two other carseats and it looks good too.
4,Booster,"Excelent booster, I have 2 of them.My kids and wife are safe and secure in the car.Completely satisfied."
4,Bulova's Watch 98T91,"The watch is very beautifull, the only thing against it is that the body is to small and it's very difficult to read the time specially when the hands are very close to 12,3,6 and 9 positions."
5,This product makes life much easier.,"Works like a charm to take rust off metal. I used it on a galvanized steel roof. No need to use steel brushes, sanders etc. Just spray off with water and prime 24 hours later. Great product."
5,a good textbook!,"A very thorough approach to French grammar, designed for the student who is almost fluent. Full of examples and rules, it gives you all of the support you will need in expanding your French abilities. There are a few exercises scattered within whose answers can be found at the end of the book. I would only reccommend it to someone at the 3rd year level of college French."
4,Good collection of a varity,"This album consist of a varity of composer, like Verdi, Mozart, Beethoven etc.. This is really a good start for new listener in classical music."
5,Awesome show,I love this show and the season is a must-have at our house. My dad has recently become a fan and I can now share prior seasons with him.Super!
4,Quirky Fun!,Quirky Fun! This series is a fun Sci-Fi/Comedy that is light and potentially believable. It helps lighten the mood after a hard day of work. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!
5,So much fun,"Eureka is such a unique TV show compared to everything else that is on. It is fun, entertaining and still gives you a moment to think about life and what is really important."
5,"Eureka, I found it!","First discovered Eureka on Netflix. Eureka is a delightfully different TV series. Great actors, top-quality script writing, and excellent character development with stories always brimming over with humor, suspense, romance, drama, and sci-fi enough to keep us all entertained as well as challenged. My husband usually figures the outcome of most movies, and loses interest half-way through. But Eureka has pleasantly surprised him, and he's hooked, too. Finally! A family-friendly our family enjoys watching together. We enjoyed Eureka so much we bought the whole set. We'll be replaying these for years. A Fantastic series! (A hint - Amazon sells them much cheaper than stores.)"
5,eureka 2,The ease with which I was able to purchase the item and the download speed was great. THe clarity and volume was good. I have been quite happy with everything that I have purchased thru the Amazon store online thru my kindle fire (which is also a terrifice product).
2,Great series. Terrible packaging. Buy the digital episodes.,"For whatever reason, they decided to go with the absolute worst packaging I have ever seen on a DVD. Bargain bin movies come better stored than these discs. Every single one of them had fallen out its plastic grommet, and was scratched to the point that all episodes would skip and some would even stop playing half way through. This is completely unacceptable. I highly recommend that you skip the DVD's and buy the digital episodes."
1,Worst DVD packaging EVER!!,"I'm not going to comment on the quality of the show. I haven't watched the 2nd season yet, but the first was an easy 4 stars. This DVD set features ""eco-friendly"" packaging, which is fine in it's own right. But the packaging severely damages the discs. The 2nd disc in my set was already delaminated upon first opening. In short, the spindles do not allow you to remove the disc without bending the disc severely. They also grip the discs way too tight, which I believe accounts for the delamination (bending the discs also accelerates delamination). If you look through my reviews you'll notice a couple of other reviews commenting on poor DVD packaging, but this set is BY FAR THE WORST!! If you are a DVD collector I assume you're educated in proper DVD care and storage...if you're not a DVD collecting nerd like me, then you may not know the effects of such horrendous packaging. Take it from me, DO NOT BUY THIS. Rent or download it instead."
5,We love this show.,Eureka is a great show. Quirky and geek friendly. Ma and my wife finished the season quickly in order to catch up and watch season 3.
3,Eureka Season Two - Somewhat Disappointed,"Absolutely loved Season 1. For me, Season 2 is the same plot over and over, continuing from Season 1. The characters haven't developed much past Season 2. Although I enjoyed Season 2, I probably won't buy anymore of the Eureka DVD's due to the repetitiveness. Overall, the idea of a town full of genius scientists is so cool! I was hoping for a bit more innovation of the plot line because the idea of the show is wonderful and entertaining and because this show has so many great reveiws."
2,Light entertainment plus nonsensical pseudoscience,"This is a series badly in need of some scientific expertise on staff. Since the whole theme of the show is supposedly centered on science, it would be nice if their version of it made any kind of sense at all. Instead, they seem to reach into the air and pull out a few scientific catch phrases, tie a bow around them, and call it science fiction. For example, in one episode, a scientist, attempting to develop a cell regeneration technology, is accidentally zapped with particles from an alien(?) artifact, which causes gene mutations to run rampant, allowing his brain to control his healing processes (coincidentally making it LOOK like he HAD developed cellular regeneration) and eventually enabling him to perform acts of telekinesis. Huh?I give it two stars for appealing characters, decent acting, and nice sets. But if you have any scientific bent at all, this series is not for you. It will only annoy you (as it has me.)"
4,Get it! Get it!,"What can I say, I received my dvd in a very short time. Which I loved and have been watching my movie every chance I get. I am a big fan of this show and now it's in my hands and I love it. Thank you for having this move at a good price because with money being tight I am glad you had it at a price that I could afford and the shipping wasn't bad either. Thank you for a great product and great timeing in getting the product to the coustomer. Great Job, Keep up the Good Work!! And yes, I have told other about your site."
5,Fun!,"As usual, this series was truly fun to watch. The characters are fun and the chemistry between them is always great to watch."
1,It's like a bad high school film project . . .,"that seems to go on for days. But, that said, if you find jokes about giant alien rectal probes funny, this is the film for you. Quite possibly, this is the only film ever made for you."
5,WOW AMAZING PRODUCT,"WOW THIS STUFF IS GREAT ,420K MILES ON MY CAR AND IT RUNS GREAT I RUN IT EVERYWHERE ,GEARS WHERE GOING HARD IN THE MORNING WHEN I ADD THE MOTORKOTE THEY GOING SMOOTH GREAT PRODUCE ,I USE IT ALL OVER MY CAR REAR DIFF TRANNY,ENGINE,POWER STEERING ,IT WORTH THE MONEY"
3,Set Up the program,"way, way too hard. Had to pay an electronics salesman to convert my broken MX35s to our new MX 350. Cost me another $50.!"
4,Good Bang for the Buck,Easily able to clone 7 of 8 remote controls to this remote either by device codes or remote to remote learning. Easy to operate. No issues after 4 weeks. Rated only a four because of no adequate documentation for macro programming.
4,Appears to do the job.,"programing instructions are to vague, I'm still programing it after two weeks, it takes a lot of trial and error do to the lack of programing instructions. But when I get a program in, it appears to do the job it is supposed to do."
4,Good product with a little help,"This remote is a good remote. I was able to sync this remote with all my components which was quite a few. I like all the options it has. I did have to go through all of the codes to sync up some of the components. Don't give up just keep trying. It is a little time consuming to get quite a few components synced up.The only thing I didn't expect and the reason I rated it 4 stars... I had to purchase a rf/ir signal booster(an extra $25) which takes in a rf command and translates it to ir. It was placed in my closet with most of my compnonents. After the signal is translated through the booster, it shoots a signal which bounces of the (closet)walls and commands the other components. That's why I say it needed a little help. If this was talked about in the description of this product, I might have went with a remote/booster combo which is available or I would have atleast known that I needed this so I wouldn't have to then research this and order and wait for delivery."
1,Blues Brothers video game review,"It has little-to-nothing to do with the real movie and the stuff that does have to do with film is a slap in the face. The story is bull-flop. The levels in this game look more like something out of a rejected Super Mario Bros or Zelda game. Infact, the first level is very easy to beat even for a 1st level game. It takes 15 seconds to finish. This game also has ""cakes"" that make you stronger. Just like in real life. Its also confusing at best. I mean one level,you have 100 records(which by the way are weapons in the game), the next you have 50 and the next you have zero. You have no control of how many of them can you keep. The game play in hard at best. On some levels, you have more or less time then on other levels at random. The giant snake on one of the levels is very hard to control. the floors in this game are like ice. Overall, it's a awful game with stupid story. I give Blues Brothers a 1 out of 10."
5,Does what it's supposed to.,"I got this thermometer in order to be able to determine with restaurant-like precision, the exact moment in which my roasts are ready to be taken out of the oven.Title says all. Cheap in price, quality product made with durable materials, amazon prime eligible. What else could one ask for?."
3,Adjustable = bad,"One of the features of this thing is that you can recalibrate it by holding the stem and turning the head. Problem with that is it's super easy to do it by accident. Even just trying to jam it in the holder it's hard not to get it off calibration. It's a good little cheap thermometer with a long testing rod, but that is all moot since I can't trust the temperature reading."
4,Works.,They work as advertised. I've used them in a food safety and sanitation testing capacity to help keep the public safe.Con: Have to calibrate.
5,No cook should be without one!,"This is not my first Taylor thermometer. I'm pretty sure my other one was ""borrowed"" by a relative who also liked it. Actually, she did me a favor --- this newer version allows you to use the case as a handle. This keeps my hands further away from the hot food surface --- I really like this feature.Another thing I like about this thermometer is that the probe is thin --- some cooking thermometers are so thick that the chicken breast is mangled by the time you finish poking holes in it to see if it is done. I admit that I am a terrible cook and I need all the help I can get. This Taylor thermometer is one thing I can rely on to help keep me from serving undercooked meats."
3,It's what you'd expect...,It takes a while to get a reading. It's nice to have on hand until I purchase a digital thermometer.
1,This is garbage,"I cooked chicken and if I was relying on this thermometer, I would have burned it. It never moved passed 20 degrees. It's going back to amazon. Do not buy, the price can be tempting but don't fall for it."
3,tiny display,"The display on this thermometer is extremely small, it's like nail head! hopefully your eyes are good, because very difficult to read."
4,Hot Stuff!,"I bought a couple of these thermometers for soap making and so far, they've been great. They're accurate, easy to read, easy to clean and super affordable."
4,useful tool,I purchased one of these and then promptly destroyed it. The face is plastic and should not remain in the oven. I melted the face. I purchased another and love it. Use it to test the temperature for bread and doneness for meat. Next time I will read all the other reviews more carefully!
1,Never worked,"This item never worked out of the box. Not in the freeze, not under hot water, not in boiling water not in a pot roast. Always showed the same temperature. I assume I got a defective one and got another one at the grocery store which has the added benefit of not needing a magnifying glass to read the dial. It now sits in a landfill."
5,FINALLY FOUND ANOTHER ONE,"THERE MAY BE FANCIER, COSTLIER THERMOMETERS OUT THERE. NONE, IN MY OPINION, WORKS BETTER THAN THIS WONDERFUL, SIMPLE TO USE DEVICE. MY FIRST ON WAS SPIRITED AWAY AT A DINNER PARTY AND I HAVE FINALLY FOUND ITS REPLACEMENT. WONDERFUL."
1,wildly inaccurate,"This thermometer didn't work at all for me. I calibrated it using ice water, then tried to measure the temperature of some bread just out of the oven. Temp seemed too high. When I returned the thermometer to the ice water, the reading was off by about 50 degrees. Maybe I got a lemon."
2,Instant Slow Thermometer,"Slow slow slow. Takes more than 15 seconds to read a temperature from a piece of meat off the grill. My mercury thermometer posts a temperature faster than that. Don't call it ""instant read"" when it is just a regular thermometer."
5,very good for price,"small, works as expected and completely worth the price. Why would I pay $20 to buy a thermometer anyways? $5 was my price and I got it for that."
2,Not accurate,I got this product hoping that I could use it for a temp range of 110 to 165 but it is not close to accurate over a span of temps.
5,Great Little Thermometer for the Money!,"Nice little thermometer and it comes with its own little bright yellow case (not shown in the product photo) which is quite handy. Doesn't take up much room in the drawer, easy to find in its little bright yellow case when we need it, easy to read and yes, it is ""pocket-sized"" so will be great to take out to the grill when the weather gets warmer. Accurate as well. For the money, you would have a hard time finding a better deal. For people who use a cooking thermometer only occasionally like we do, I would highly recommend this one. They sell larger ones, digital ones, ones with ""hangers"" to fit on the side of a pot (easily remedied with a paper clip, we've found ~ no big deal), but for an all-around handy thermometer this one fit the bill quite nicely for us. And qualified for Amazon Free SuperSaver Shipping as well (delivered five days after we ordere it). Could not ask for more."
1,didn't work,"It did not work, the needle never moved. I wish I saved my money on this item. Save your money."
2,Not that happy with this product : (,Face is so small and on top of that the numbers are even smaller and my eye sight is 20/20 .The best part is the temp is spot on
5,taylor classic instant-read pocket thermometer,"I like the convenience of having a multifunctional sleave which acts as a safetyfeature with the hexagonal housing,as well as a storage and housing with a shirtclip."
1,Not even worth the money,"More of a guess work tool than a instrument. Doesn't read accurately even when ""calibrated"". Waste of time and money."
1,too slow,"Stupid thing is ridiculously slow! I had another dial thermometer that I felt was slow, and after reading the reviews, I thought that I would buy this one. But it is even slower than my old one! Takes more than a minute for the reading to stabilize!"
1,Arrive Defective,"Arrived stuck at 100 degrees F - would not budge. Sent back to American distributor company one month ago, but have not received replacement. Made in China, of course."
1,You Better Check Calibration,I bought 2 because of the price. When I recieved the thermomter my first task was to immerse both of them in boiling water and then ice water. The neither unit was calibrated. Worse they both couldn't be calibrated because there is no way to adjust the span. So in the end they hit the garbage can. You get what you pay for.
1,Broke after one day,"Very unhappy. First time I used it the cover over the dial popped off due to the heat (kind a problem for a thermometer). In trying to get the cover back on, the case bent and now it is useless.For what it is worth, the packaging says that they have a ""lifetime guarantee,"" but I think that is pretty useless when the cost of shipping it back is nearly the cost to buy one new, to say nothing of the hassle and waiting."
2,Very large margin of error,As received it read 40 degrees when set in a glass of slush (a mixture of crushed ice and water). I adjusted it to 32 degrees and then inserted it in a pan of boiling water. It read 202 degrees. Since slush is exactly 32 degrees and boiling water is 212 degrees I was very disappointed with it (using the above described technique is one way to accurately calibrate a thermometer). I wanted this item for yeast proofing but since the accuracy is so bad I won't be using it for that (I wanted something closer to 2 degree accuracy).
3,Don't use in the barbecue grill,"Seemed to work great while it was in use inside the barbecue grill covered, but when I took it out the face was brown. The cover over the hand on the thermometer had disappeared!! Just be aware!!"
1,lousy thermometer,"I have had this product about a year. It has stopped working, it is totally useless. Very cheaply made. Don't buy. I repeat don't buy or you will be sorry"
4,We do chicken right.,Does what it is supposed to do. Can also be used as a rectal thermometer but it might make the meat taste funny...
2,worked until the lens melted,"This thermometer has a major flaw. The lens coveringthe dial is plastic, not heat-resistant.I put it in a turkey being cooked in the oven and it melted. I guess it's for checking temperatures of foods once out of the oven."
3,Slow Taylor,This thermometer is ok. Not the best. I thought it would be better. Sometimes I wonder if it is actually working and it is pretty slow.
3,Small roast thermometer,"This thermometer although nice, it very small. The face is less than 1"" wide. Very useable but not as readable as I some would like."
2,Tiny View Thermometer,"Too dificult to read. I should have purchased a magnifying glass. At least it comes with a plastic cover for the shaft with a clip, to protect my pocket?"
2,"Nowhere near ""Instant""","Time is relative. If you are slow and consider an ""instant"" to be ~20seconds, this thermometer is for you.When I look at the gauge, I can read it instantly, but that's true of any thermometer.I purchased an electronic thermometer that gets its reading in under 10s, so I've been using that."
2,Not Useful,The thermometer is extremely slow in registering temperature. What it indicates is not very accurate..The device is cheaply made. The temperture numbers are printed on paper. The thin plastic dome will warp and structurely distort in time due to heat and moisture from cooking.
2,"Nice thermometer, not accurate","This is a nice, small thermometer, but it is no where near accurate. Water boils at 212F, but while my water is sitting on the stove boiling it reads 180F and never goes higher.I'll update my review if I notice a change. I know you can calibrate it, so I'll try that. I don't think you should have to calibrate it for 30F+ though."
2,Taylor thermometer for the grill,"It is very slow to register. It does not respond with a instant read. As a result, I don't trust it."
2,Not so great,It works but it is not what I expected. If you want to use for frying temps I would not recommend because it only goes up to 200ish degrees which does not help for frying. But if you are only needing a small thermometer for meat and chicken then it would work.
3,Just OK,"I question it's accuracy. Also think it takes too long to reach a stable temp. Prefer the Taylor digital (yellow, can't remember the model #)."
4,Nice Thermometer,Great thermometer for a great price. Displays temperature very accurately. It works very well and doesn't take long to display temperature.
3,"Not accurate, Slow to measure","I bought two of these. Neither one was accurate at both ends of the scale simultaneously; if we calibrated for boiling temps, it was off on the freezing temps, and vice versa. It was also VERY slow to measure the temp of my hot water; by the time the needle s-l-o-w-l-y made its way up to approximate the temp of my water (poured from a boiling pot!) the water had lost at least 15 degrees. I ended up getting a different model thermometer with a larger dial, that I was much happier with. I would only recommend this one if you don't need a really-quick measurement, and suggest calibrating it for a specific purpose (i.e., don't try to use the same thermometer for measuring at both ends of the scale). The plastic sleeve does have a handy socket for calibration/adjustments."
3,Dial is small rest is good,The dial is very small about 1 inch in diameter but it does the job. If you are looking for a bigger one its not for you
2,Adequate,"This instrument works well for measuring temperature of hot water (I use it for coffee brewing), however it does take longer than I consider reasonable to reach a steady needle position (takes about 20 seconds to reach 212F when put into boiling water form room temperature), which induces some guess work on my part. I imagine this is a design oversight of some sort, which could easily have been remedied with a marginal bit of effort. There is probably a better product out there (for comparable money), and if buying another thermometer I will look for it and certainly not buy another of these."
5,Taylor Thermometer,"I am a cook for the US Army, and I have been using Taylor Instant-Read Dial Thermometer's for over 5 years now. It is quick reading, easy to use, and reliable. I would use this thermometer over any of the newer digital ones. Most thermometers as with most things need to be recalibrated. Taylor has supplied a calibration device on the carry case!On top of all of the great features that the Taylor Analog Thermometer has, its also a bragain. At just $6.99 each you can not beat it!I would recommend this product to anyone who does any type of cooking. This is ecspecially helpful when cooking Chicken, as you can test all of your piece quickly to make sure that all are done."
1,Internal face spins around,"I had the opportunity to use this thermometer once after losing my previous meat thermometer of 15 years.The second time I went to use this thermometer, the internal face spun around freely inside the enclosure. Obviously this makes it impossible to tell the temperature and rendered the thermometer useless.I always try to remember that you get what you pay for. For this product it's sadly too true."
1,Constantly goes out of calibration,"I've owned one of these for about a year, and always handled it gently. But the thing is constantly putting itself way out of calibration. One day water boils at 202F (I live in Colorado), the next day it boils at 178F. I keep a wrench in my kitchen so I can always boil a batch of water, calibrate it, and then actually measure what I need to. But that is a huge pain and a waste of energy. Right now it's sitting in a bucket of ice water. This is very special water indeed--it's 12F!Other than its ability to measure temperature, yeah, it's great."
5,Low Tech Works Best,"I have been cooking in resturants for many years and I never went a night without this thermometer.Its quick, accurate, and cheap. If it does go out of whack, just put it in a glass of ice set it for 32d.Get it you'll love it!!Just don't put it in the oven...."
2,Not impressed!,"I was using this as a liquid thermometer, and its definitely not an instant read. It takes awhile for it to slowly rise to the temp that the liquid is actually at. Not helpful when accuracy is needed!"
4,bookmarc,"Just what I needed to replace a broken one. I'd give it 5 stars except for the cheap plastic sleeve that grips the thermometer so tightly, if it's clipped to your pocket, you will not be able to remove it without unclipping the sleeve from your clothing."
3,Works OK and Good Price,"This was very inexpensive and I bought it as a filler to get free shipping. It works fine and is a good basic kitchen tool to have, but there are two major things to note before you purchase:1) The readings only go up to 220F so if you intend to use it at 235F (i.e. if you want a candy thermometer), this is not the one for you.2) The gauge is not waterproof - some liquid did end up inside the top part for me!"
1,It only worked once,"After I used it the first time, it shows 130 degrees sitting on my kitchen counter.I've put it over night in my freezer and it showed 45 degrees the next morning.I wondered why it was so inexpensive, now I know."
3,A problem with the case...,"Thermometer itself is fine, but the case came with it is very tight. You really need to push/pull hard and carefully not to break the meter."
1,Not accurate,"This thermometer was way off upon arrival - i would boil water and it would show it as being 180 degrees instead of 212! It did come with instructions for recalibrating it, but that seemed like too much trouble, especially since it was inaccurate upon arrival. By the way, I had bought it to use for heating water to the correct temp. to make green tea, but then found the Hamilton Beach programmable kettle - a steal at only $35, and a fantastic, easy to use kettle with lots of different temperature settings - a much better solution for my needs."
1,Cheap - Lasted 2 weeks,"I bought this to check the temperature of bread. After two weeks of being used maybe 3-4 times a week (during which time it worked perfectly), I pulled it out of the drawer to see it reading 40 degrees. I recalibrated it to read 70 as shown by my thermostat and inserted in to my bread loaf and it read no higher than 140 degrees, though a finished loaf should read between 185 and 210. My bread was quite browned on top and when I sliced in, it was cooked through. So this thing is definitely no longer giving accurate readings. I wouldn't waste the money on something that won't work after a handful of uses."
3,"It works well enough, but it is not instant","I bought this thermometer specifically because of the instant read claim. While this thermometer is far from instant, it still is much quicker then the other thermometer I was using before. It is quick enough that I can spot check the meat, where my old thermometer wasn't fast enough to do that.This thermometer comes with a pen style case, which is nice. It is pretty small but is still easy to read. Another neat feature is that you can calibrate it if you desire. It's simple and easy to use, and is inexpensive compared to many of the other thermometers out there.Overall, I'm pleased with this, it works and it is somewhat quick. My only complaint is that it is not instant like it claims."
2,questionable accuracy,"I ordered two of these at the same time to use for cheese making and soap making, where, in both cases, temperature is critical. The thermometers read two different temperatures, about three degrees off from each other. The paper that came with them says they can be ""calibrated"" by twisting the head on the stick. O.K., then which one is correct? I live at a higher elevation and have no plans to go down to sea level and boil water to set them. I'm not confident that they are suitable for anything more precise than seeing if a roast is approximately medium rare."
4,Reliable and Cheap,"This will fit in a shirt pocket, and is accurate and fast reading. The case has a built in ""wrench"" that allows you to re-calibrate it if it starts to drift. The price on Amazon is about half what it is in retail stores."
5,Works perfectly,"I use this to test the internal temperature of my bread and it works great. When I first tested it in some ice water, it came out 32 degrees."
2,Too long to read temp,"This thermometer does its job, but usually it's inaccurate. Chicken is continually not done even when the thermometer will read 180. It also takes a long time for the temperature to get up to what it reads, about 60 seconds from the time you insert the probe. I'll be getting a digital instant read soon."
4,simple to use and accurate,"Yes, to the user who gave this a bad review because the plastic melted, you moron! The directions clearly state not to put the thermometer inside the oven, leave in liquid while cooking, and not to put in dishwasher. Only negative was the high shipping cost more than item. Item came quick, but then I saw the same thermometer for $6 at Stop and Shop. Use the ice and cold water to calibrate to 32 degrees and you are ready to go!"
1,Broken right out of the package,I will be contacting the company. This was broken when I got it. But another brand. I would not buy again...obviously.
2,Dial too small,"Do yourself a favor, buy one with the larger dial. This one is too small.You'll need a magnifying glass to read the temperature."
5,It tells you how hot the food is,"Bought this to tell me how hot the food is...and it tells me how hot the food is, which is what I bought it for."
2,Carmelite Prayers and Devotions,This book was more simplistic than I expected. A compiling of Saints who followed Carmelite paths.I was expecting something deeper.
4,Excellent Wood Polish,This polish works very well and does not leave a hazy film on my wood furniture. There is little to no odor so those sensitive to perfumes should not have any problem with this product. My only compliant is that when you get down to the bottom of the bottle it's a little hard to get the remainder out through the spray top. But I am very satisfied with this this polish.
5,Great primer for the fundamentals of Christian prayer,"Whether or not de Mello was ""enlightened"" or not when he wrote this (based on another reviewer's comments), this book serves as a classic primer for the fundamentals of Christian prayer. It includes much of the eastern influence which de Mello became more associated with toward the end of his life. The book talks much about meditation, lectio divina, and the spiritual exercises. De Mello's contribution here is to attempt to bridge a gap in Christian prayer with some non-traditional methods. It is an invitation to a deeper form of prayer, where communication with God comes through the heart. Indeed, this form of prayer is all the more Christian in my opinion for its observance of the type of prayer Jesus himself used according to scripture."
2,Vipassana Meditation wrapped in a Christian package,"DeMillo has been trained and experienced Vipassana Meditation techniques in India which is NON SECULAR. His advise and philosophy is excellent although clearly nothing more than the philosophy of the Buddha (the enlightened one) adapted to a Christian (secular) agenda making it a bit disingenuous. He takes disproportionate credit for the 90% of his teachings which is Buddhism is presented with a 10% Christian twist. That being said, a good philosophy is a good philosophy no matter where it comes from. Just think he should be a bit more honest about what he is selling and where he got it. Those seeking the unadulterated version of the teachings of this philosophy should seek out a Vipassana Meditation retreat.A Customer"
4,It has big numbers,It is easy to read and easy to use but it doesn't have a on and off switch so it is always on. If you want to turn it off to save the battery you have to take the battery out when you are done using it and put it back in when you want to use it again. It would be a lot more convenient if you could just turn it off.
1,"Same book, different cover",I'll repeat what an August 5th reviewer stated : If you've already bought the book How To Talk To Anyone - 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships by the same author then don't buy this book as it is the same. I bought both of them together and was really annoyed when I discovered they were the same. How can someone re-write a book under a different title without any mention of this fact on the book cover ?You'll also note that Editorial review of both books is the same and have the same quotes from Larry King and McKay. Shame on Amazon for not giving me a full refund!
1,Waste of time,This book is pretty pathetic. Writing style is cheesy and even ridiculous at times. Waste of time.
5,Best read in a long time,THis book by far is the best book I have had to read on the subject it speaks to. Leil Lowndes tell's it from the point of view most people can understand. I like that! This book is both helpful and practical it can be applied right away by anyone that can read and follow instruction. I loved it!
3,Terrible writing,"Some good tips are included, but unless you have a high tolerance for shrill, motherly advice, the writer's style may annoy you to the point of throwing the book across the room. Also, as a man, I think that a lot of the advice is geared towards women, or at least, works much better for women than men. Finally, advice directed towards men, seems to be of the wishful thinking variety. (i.e., what a woman THINKS she wants from a man.)"
1,Great advice! ...for those born yesterday without common sense...,"This book talks about most basic, common sense manners. If any of those ""techniques"" are new to you, than you either 5 year old kid that already knows how to read, or you were ""away"" for a very long time...The writing will drive you crazy! Confusing vocabulary and style shows this book was written by woman whose only intention was to make any man bleed from his ears..."
4,A good read,"I recommend this book for business and relationships. Learned some great techniques to communicate with my colleagues from it. The tips about body language and subliminal rapport were practical and effective in my case. I find the catchy names unnecessary, although entertaining for sure. The insider part was new to me and I found it quite important for mastering success. All in all, a book that delivers the goods and well worth your money."
3,"They work, but not perfectly","These lose a star for having a very wide pointy end, making them hard to use with chicken breast or thin cuts, and they lose another point for being pretty fragile - I've broken several, though I'm not sure how. Overall, though, the one that still works is doing fine and is easy to read."
1,Bad,This product is so useless I would never recommend it for anyone. I checked it three or four times and it never showed the correct temperature.
3,"When it Works, It's Great","This tool works occassionally, so we chose not to continue using it. However, it does clean well and is dishwasher safe."
3,as expected,"3 stars because i have not tried it yet, the print on the thermometer will prob wear off. Will update soon as it is used."
4,yeast thermoneter,Thus iyem is really useful for those of us just starting bread making. The last thing you want to do is mess up you're yeast!! Thiis product takes out the guess work. It works great on cooking meats also!
3,Love me some medium rare chicken,"Consistently reads higher than it really is, aim for ~5-10 higher than your target temperature. Several times it indicated that it was at a perfect Medium-Medium Well on a roast Chicken only to cut into it, after resting, that it was much closer to Medium Rare. Ends up, Salmonella makes you poop pretty good. For a bout 3 days straight.Also, dig deep with this guy. Aim for about an inch from the tip to be in the center mass of your roast."
2,I didn't like it.,I don't understand why all the reviews for this thermometer are good. The numbers/indicators on the thermometer began to peel off after I put it in the dishwasher. I had to throw it away. Maybe I just got a bad one.
4,Decent Choice,"This product works fairly well. It's still a bit of a hassle getting an accurate reading sometimes. Especially when the oven steams up and an excessive amount of moisture clouds the screen of the thermometer. I'd say for the most part, that won't be a problem, and the reading does seem to be quite accurate. It's a good choice for Turkey, Chicken, Pork Roast, and thick cuts of Beef. I'd say for the price, just pick one up and try it out. It should fit most peoples needs."
2,Not for a convection oven!,"I don't know if the problem was I was using these in a convection oven, but this was pretty worthless. I did the turkey last week. I started with this stuck in vertically, between the drumstick and into the thigh. The temp got really high way before I knew it could be that high, so I thought maybe I had placed it wrong. When I basted at 2.5 hours, I moved it to a horizontal placement into the thigh. I was encouraged that it seemed right (about 150 degrees). Before the turkey was possibly done, the temp on this thing climbed off the scale. I am sure my turkey was not over 200+ degrees.I am guessing it does not like to be in a convection oven and have the hot air blowing on it. When I tested it later on my tap water, it was about the same as my basic BBQ instant read thermometer, so it does not seem defective. Just don't use in a convection oven!"
2,"Worth the $4, but not much more","This thermometer does register the temperature pretty accurately. However, the printing on it disappeared after only a couple of washings."
2,"Does what it's supposed to do, barely.","I read the other reviews saying that the black writing comes off easily, and that is the case with mine as well. The temperature seems to be accurate, but with all the other great thermometers out there, why hassle with one where you have to remember where the temperature readings were after the black print wears off. Would not buy if I had to do it over again."
1,Cannot reccommend,I liked everything about this thermometer EXCEPT that the numbers washed off! I will not buy this product again. Low price for a product that does not hold up.
3,The Iron Men,"Good condition for a former library book. Great story line, well written, captivating, and full of action. Should be made into a movie. Insightful knowledge of East German secret police tactics and communist oppression."
1,I'd give this zero stars if I could,"I bought one of these at a little specialty kitchen shop, and I can't believe how bad it is. No matter how I coarse I set the grind, no salt comes out unless you shake it or pound on it like crazy. Even then it doesn't come out well at all. If you like a very very very light touch of salt (say one grain) this may be the grinder for you. We hate it."
5,Another vaue from RQ!,"1200 questions that cover Steps 1,2,& 3 for a small price. A great value of good board-type questions by the path professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences."
1,Terrible packaging,"I bought a box of the 2-1.2"" nails and a box of the 2"" nails from Amazon because they were a little cheaper than Lowes or Home Depot. When I opened the box when they arrived, there were 4,000 nails scattered in the bottom of the shipping box. The plastic containers they come in were completely shattered. Just 1 small piece of bubble wrap in a box that was way too large to be shipped in. I sent them back. The re-order was a little better. The nails were intact, but the tops of both plastic boxes were shattered, and unusable. I store the nails in the cordless nail gun boxes so its important the tops fit tight. Until Amazon gets the shipping worked out, buy the nails locally. The nails are great. The 1 star is for Amazon's packaging."
4,J Lunceford,Everything happened as expected.m Shipping was prompt and item was in the condition mentioned.
2,Adverse Effects...,"This book only made me think more about what to eat what not to eat and how to deal with the ""issues"" in my head. I was on the road to a great recovery and was feeling much better when I started reading this book and it just took me back into the world that I lived in before adding a whole new spectrum of thoughts that I had never had before that. I HATED the things that this book made me think about and I started comparing myself to the girl in the book and how I need to be a better anorexic than her. I know that some people love this book and it helped them a lot , but it had the reverse effect on me, so if you are a parent... I wouldn't recommend that you get this book for your child. Do you REALLY want to take the risk of it having an adverse effect on your child? They are already struggling enough and this book might add to that. I personally do not recommend this book to anyone."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,"This book is FANTASTIC, Jenni writes so wonderfully as to express every emotion that is involved with recovery. The book is perfect for anyone suffering from an eating disorder, dealing with a loved one who has a disorder, or treatment personnel. The book gives you insight into the struggles, victories, and confusion around the realm of eating, weight, body image, self worth, blame and shame. I have read it multiple times, and always get more from it."
5,Eating Disorder as a person --- WOW!,"This book, written by both a woman working through her ED and her therapist, shows a fantastic way to look at eating disroders. Read on to find out. Again, a fantastic purchase for clients and people who love someone with an eating disorder...gives great insight."
3,Life Without Ed,"This is an easy read but focuses on the author's recovery & stumbles along the way. I did not personally reap any benefit from reading this book but if you've never read any ""self-help/recovery"" books before, you may gain a few tips from this one. Her therapist has a few chapters in the book where he tells you what worked for ""her"". It's not a step-by-step book but if someone loans you the book, give it a read. I wouldn't buy it though. It's just not ""hard-core"" enough to give you any boundaries or core work to help you get started on your on self recovery. It may give you the hope & reassurance that you need to recover but that's about all!!!"
3,Wish we had borrowed this book,"This book was a good look into the mind of a person with an ED but it's not one of those books I need to keep and cherish - or mark up and highlight or refer back to. My husband read a few chapters and gave up - too much the same. I keep trying to finish it, concerned that I will miss something important if I don't. Our daughter has her own copy and I think for her it is important - it helps her verbalize her feelings and really gives her somebody that she identifies with. But even she, a month later, has not finished the book. Perhaps down the road I can loan it out to someone to save them some money."
1,Not Helpful at all,"This book goes beyond campy. I'm all for cheesey humor, but come on. Her attempts at funny clutter an otherwise empty account. Honestly, there a many books about eating disorders out there. I've ready many of them. Most o9f them are at least a teeny bit helpful This one is not and IS the only one I've given a negative review to."
5,Best book for sufferers (and great for parents too).,"One of the challenges of being a parent with a child suffering from Anorexia is finding educational sources for them that are supportive of ending the disease without providing further information on how to secretly purge and restrict and without blaming the parents, the media, or ""culture"" for their illness.After reading literally dozens of books in the field, this was the only one we encouraged our child to read. She quickly empathized with the notion of the ED being separate and distinct. It helped and continues to help her cope with the dangerous and unhealthy impulses brought on by the disease.There are only a handful of books that I recommend to parents and sufferers. This is one of the mandatory ones."
3,rcm-31,"As a recovering bulimic anorexic, I think this book was a little superficial. I don't think the writer entered the really dark side of eating disorder. I understand that the book itself is not a therapy, but part of it, but the title was the first thing I had difficulty accepting, because in the world of eating disorders, ""ANA"" and ""MIA"" are our best friends and we see them as girls, not Ed, the ""bad husband"" (by the way, she never mentioned these expressions in the book. I would suggest the book to relatives and friends of a sick person, and maybe boys and girls starting with these diseases. But not to someone I was before. Overall, it was her story and I'm glad she shared in a book to help others. So many people, even celebrities have that disease but don't talk about it, afraid of compromising their fame. Tumbs up for Jenni!"
5,change my life,"this book changed my life...its one of the greatest book, it help you realize that you are not alone and the ""feeling"" in each moment! i love it!!!!!""!"
5,Good for whatever ails ya!,"Ed is anybody's bad internal object - in my case (100 lbs overweight) Ed is the exact voice of my mother. Or, as comedian Kathy Griffith might say, Ed is the devil! SO USEFUL to have this finally quantified, their entire script written out! Takes the wind out of satan's sails... Sorry about going all huckabee on yer face - this book nails it."
5,Very helpful,I got this book for my daughter when she had a bout with an eating disorder about a year ago. She found it very helpful and is enjoying a successful recovery at this point. Great book.
3,Repetitive and not deep,"Anorexia and bulimia are horrible, devastating diseases. The author doesn't get too deep or personal with the hell she must have gone through. Rather, the book was filled with short stories (more like anecdotes) that were much the same about disagreeing with Ed and disobeying Ed. I was disappointed considering the ratings that other readers gave the book. It was very average."
3,Book about Eskimo dogs,I didn't read the book too closely because it's a gift but I did notice it was mostly about general dog care rather than just the Eskimo dogs. But I have no complaints.
4,"Grat Book, Ok price","This book has lots of good information about the dog breed. The pricing is okay, especially if you like to have coffee table books. Would be nice if it was updated and republished, but overall a good buy."
1,you can do better,"Basically a printed menu of the authors UK website, readers would be better served and significantly better informed by other offerings. Beyond its own internet offerings, the sponsors ignore at vast majority of sex on the internet."
5,Worth every penny,"Everyone should have one of these thermometers they are so worth all the money, Very convenient and easy to use"
4,Set it and Forget it.,"I could not ask for an easier to use product that did exactly what I needed it to do.Set it and forget it. Very simple instructions, very easy to use. The turkey came out perfect. I look forward to using it with other meals. Hopefully it will last a few years but for the price you can't go wrong."
1,"""HI"" isn't a good way to measure temperature...","Like the all the other bad reviews. I used it a few times and it worked fine, and then I went to use it one day and it would only display ""HI"". Oddly I bought this to replace the same model that I had used for years which also stopped working with the same ""HI"" error, but because it lasted so long I stayed with the brand, but the second one was clearly of lesser quality and didn't last very long at all. I will not buy this model again. Try someting else."
1,Useless- Right Out of the Box,"Hot temperature readings are increasingly inaccurate, only registering a reading of ""Hi"" after a certain point (WAY below the advertised temperature threshold).Heavily iced water reads at 45F.Product was tested straight out of the packaging.Ain't nobody got time for this!"
3,Know what you are purchasing,"I guess mostly my fault. Coming off a high end remote cooking thermometer, I was tired of the probe burning out, so I ordered this unit. Just know you have to know the temperature you are looking for. For example, there is no ""Medium Rare Beef"" setting. Just temps."
4,Does work well until...,"This is a decent unit unless you expose the prong cable to heat, or pressure. They get damaged quite easily. You can buy replacement probes, which I do, but I wish these were more durable, and better insulated. As far as accuracy, and reliability reading wise, it seems to be spot on."
1,Defective out of the box,"Arrived in fresh, clean retail blister pack. On Christmas Eve, ready for the first holiday meal, I opened it up carefully, removed the battery tab, and turned it on. All the LCDs lit up (88:88 etc) and all controls were nonfunctional. I pressed the reset button, reloaded the batteries, tried new fresh batteries, re-inserted the probe, pressed every reasonable combination of buttons - nothing changed. Utterly useless and nonfunctional right out of the box."
2,"Great idea, poor quality","This is my second digital timer/thermometer. The first was a Ploder and the probe died after a couple of years. This product arrived with a broken button, so I can't adjust the timer or temperature. I'm admittedly too lazy to return it, so I'll use it as a digital thermometer without the alarm or timer. Reading the other reviews on Amazon for both this product and the Ploder begs the question: why doesn't someone make a quality digital thermometer/timer?"
1,thermoworks an oven probe that could,I have gone through a dozen probes. This company has a high temperature probe and great little meter that handles up to 900 degrees[...]The website is hard to navigate but the product is fantastic. My instant read doubles as a fever thermometer
3,acceptable,"So far I haven't had any real problems with this thermometer but have only used it a few times so far. However, the temperature probe only goes up to 392 degrees so if you want to also use it to check the accuracy of your oven thermostat you will have to test it at no higher than 350 degrees. But it works great for the foods I have used it for so far and hopefully the probe will work for quite awhile and will not need to be replaced too soon and as per other reviews the probe should last as long as you don't expose it to temperatures above 350 degrees . This also has a timer option which is also very handy!"
2,Where do I buy a new sensor?,"After my first try using the thermometer in the bbq, I now have a sensor that reads HI, then jumps to 200F, then to 70-something and back again to HI. If you twist the cable juuuuuuust right, you can get an acurate reading. Now I'm surfing looking for a replacement sensor."
2,Does Taylor Replace Broken Probes?,Sounds like a lot of people who bought this have the same problem with the probe going bad. Mine went bad after the second use. Is Taylor replacing bad probes?
1,Not good for outdoor use,"I purchased three of these units, fully expecting them to be less then perfect and I was not disappointed. For the money they should be just fine for any low temp (less then 350f) indoor use. I had to use them to monitor two smokers and the meat. I plugged them in and got them setup in the early morning and all was going well until the sun came out. With the bright sun it was impossible to read. It just looked like all the LCD segments were lit. Nothing buy 8's. Then as the sun got higher and hotter the screens when completely black. Not recommended for any outdoor use."
3,Total Wearout in 3 Years,"I bought this probe about 3 years ago, and with regular use (daily as timer, weekly as thermometer) pieces of its functionality failed over time. At about 2 years, it refused to accept any key inputs when sitting upright (as pictured). Next, the hour button failed, so all timing was relegated to 59 minutes or less. Recently, the timer started to reset to 0:00 in the middle of timing. And lastly, the thermometer probe just started to register very inaccurate temperatures. I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, given that it worked quite well while it lasted. I just would have expected at least a 5 year life on all functions!"
2,In theory this should work wonderfully ....,"I have one of these thermometers. They should theoretically work well, and mine did for a brief amount of time. This was nice because it would do candy, meat, chocolate and more. Well after about six months of heavy use its primary function now is a timer. Which isn't exactly useful since the stove comes with one. This has an attractive price, and is much cheaper than Pampered Chef's very similar one, but it just doesn't last for long with heavy use. This might be the ideal purchase if you aren't going to use this too often. I seriously doubt it will outlive the battery you place inside of this."
2,Taylor Digital model 1470,"Bought this to get accurate measurements of hot liquids and foods. Has a lot of potentially useful features like countdown timer and target temperature setting and even magnets to mount of the stove if required. However, the main purpose of this is to display the temp, and that it does not do accurately enough.My unit is off by 4*F, on the low side. A good and easy test is to measure boiling water - it should read 212*F. This one just made it to 208*. As well, the unit could use a little quicker update times. My Pyrex digital is very accurate showing 212* in boiling water and makes updates much more often.I sent an email to Taylor customer service. Their reply is that it is within their spec. A warning: their tolerance is +/-11*F in the 158* to 320* range. I don't know about you but I would not want to roast a turkey with this unit with a target temp of 180* and have it say done when it was only 169* and still considered ""within specs""!"
3,Where do you get new probes???,I have three of these all of the probes have gone bad.. If you change the probe between the thermometer the bad temp readings follow the probes .... like the product but need to improve probe and supply replacements///
1,Unreliable and short-lived probes,The first unit I bought lasted a while until the probe (the one with the vinyl cover) died on me. Taylor replaced it free of charge with a new probe with a braided steel cover. The new probe didn't last more than a few months before it died.Although the thermometer is cheap having to go through so many probes is absolutely ridiculous.I am looking for an alternative.
3,How to fix it,"Had the same problems as many other reviewers, worked great for awhile then starting giving a Hi indication. This appears to be a problem with the probe and new probes which appear to fix it can be obtained at www.chefdepot.com. The instructions for the device states:-dont expose the thermometer to water, dirct heat, a hot surface or direct sunlight (they do reccommend sterilizing the probe in boiling water prior to each, so presumably their advice to avoid exposing the thermometer to water-perhaps this means the electronics portion and not the probe?)-avoid getting the sensor plug wet-dont use in an oven with a temp higher than 200C/392F-dont allow the probe to directly contact bone in the food to be cooked-dont use in a microwavePerhaps the difference in the working life of the thermometer is related to how closely these admonitions are followedhope this helps"
3,Great product at first...,"I loved this thermometer when I first got it, but after six months of occasional use, it will only show celsius temperatures unless I jiggle it and then it briefly shows farenheit and then back to celsius. I've been too long away from school to do the conversion in my head so I'm shopping for another brand."
3,Broke after 1 1/2 years. A sad Thanksgiving...,"Much of last Thanksgiving was spent bending the wire at just the perfect certain angle that it required to read the temperature and wondering if indeed that temperature was right. At the price we paid it should have lasted longer methinks. Worked for 1 year, then it was dicey, then the wire where it goes into the probe stopped working completely soon. I'll pay less for a more reliable non-digital! Having a wire on something that has to be washed and manipulated just not a good idea I guess."
5,Smokin pork,"I use this to help guide me in my quest for the perfect pork butt. It works great. I now wish I would've gone with a wireless model but honestly, how lazy do I need to be?"
3,Outdoor Smoker,"I bought this product to use when I 'm smoking meats and it works great!! As a matter of fact, I bought a couple of them. The accuracy seems to be within 1-3"
1,POOR QUALITY,"Purchased this product in Jan 12Used exactly four times""Silicone"" burned down to bare wires this afternoonVery poor quality"
1,Bought 2 - both failed,"I bought a Taylor thermometer several years ago (it has the wound wire sheath) and it worked and was reliable for a long time for my BBQ. I bought 2 new Taylor thermometers, with silicone sheaths, in 2010 as backup and when my original died this year I tried one and then the other with only frustration. I replaced the batteries thinking that was the problem but that was not it. Neither one has worked well or consistently out of the box and the second gives only an 888 across the board display. I cook a lot on my BBQ and rely on accurate and reliable thermometers. This is shameful product quality. What a waste of $$. Period."
3,probe broken,"After a short time, the probe wire broke away from the probe. The digital reading is hard to read if the sun is on the screen."
1,Terrible product,"I used this thermomter about 5 times before it stopped taking accurate readings. I sent it back to the company and about 5 weeks later received a replacement thermometer. I have used it twice and it is already giving me inaccurate readings. For example, the thermometer read 146 degrees when the temperature was actually 77 degrees."
2,Worked at first?,"I'm not sure it ever really worked. I had trouble maintaining the proper temp when making Belgian candi sugar, so I checked the calibration with ice slurry as suggested by manufacturer. It read 59 degrees!!! Not sure how to calibrate. Directions don't say if I can calibrate. Manufacturer not answering or returning calls. I WILL NOT buy anything else from Taylor."
2,Poor quality,"Owned for a year or so, used it maybe 10 or 15 times, stopped working. I changed the batteries, and I'm not sure what else I could have done. The readout went all wonky and that was that. DO NOT recommend."
5,This finally fixed my turkey!,"I should have purchased a probe long ago. I used this on my turkey this year, and I finally had a turkey that was eaten all the way to the bone. It was juicy and wonderful! I placed the probe in according to the directions and set the temp on the alarm. Then stuck the timer to my oven door...loved that! The alarm went off and was loud enough to hear all over my house. I have since used it to bake a chicken and will be trying it with my smoker this weekend. I will come back and update this then if need be."
1,"Worked only one Time, now it's broken","I bought this and used it ONE TIME to monitor the temperature of cooking milk. The idea was to let it hit 180 degrees and then cool down to 120. It did this, one time. Now, apparently my room temperature is 120 and when you put it in milk straight from the fridge, it climbs to 140. Right! What a piece of crap!!! If you only need to use it once, GO AHEAD but if you want it to last more than 30 days move on to something else. Of course Amazon in their infinite generosity had my window of return expire 4 days ago. Thanks for Nothing Amazon and Taylor! I won't buy another Taylor product again, they all seem to just suck."
1,terrible...not calibrated,"Bought 2 of these, both extremely uncalibrated. Showing 30-35 degrees higher than the actualinternal temperatures of meats. After 1/2 hour for a three pound roast at 325 degrees in oven,both thermometers showed 140 degrees (ready). Actual internal temp measured with an external quickthermometer was 75 degrees."
5,large display,I got this to make my frist Christmas dinner at home. It did a wonderful job sounding the alarm when my turkey was done. It has a nice big display and the probes chord is pretty long.
4,Great for price,"Have only used it a couple times. I've heard about the probe issues when heat is excessive so I've been trying to be careful. For the price, it works great."
2,"Works great, but fries easily","I used this a handful of times on both in the oven and on my gas grill. It has all the features I want, but like many other reviewers...my probe fried itself and now doesn't work anymore. :(The magic number seems to be 350 degrees.Another customer says you can buy replacement probes for $5 from Taylor directly.I wouldn't recommend this product. Frying at 350 is just unacceptable."
1,Breaks easily,"This product worked wonderfully for about 10 sessions. Then one day it just didnt work anymore; all the temperature registered at was ""Hi"". Ive researched this particular brand a ton since this happened, and its a problem experienced by countless users over the years. Im going back to my Polder brand temperature probe; its more reliable."
2,Broke after 2 Months,"The probe broke after 2 months of use. I used the thermometer about 3x per week. A replacement probe is about $8, which is half the cost of the original thermometer."
2,Taylor digital thermometer,"Very handy item, but not very durable. I use it for low 'n slow BBQ cooking at approximately 230F. I wrapped my probe lead with aluminum foil to help protect it, but after 5 uses the probe cable had become brittle and snapped at the probe, so splicing was not an option. I suppose it will make a nice refrigerator timer. Unfortunately, it snapped just as I put 16 lbs. of pork shoulders in the Egg. I'm going to try a Polder with a metal braid probe cable rated for a higher cable temp."
2,"Works great until it doesn't, which is very soon","Really liked the features of this unit, had the exact features I needed. Then it stopped working. Just said ""Lo"" on the temp readout. Contacted the manufacturer and they immediately sent a new probe. Great customer service. But then that probe failed, too. And the next replacement probe failed. Everytime I called they sent another probe without flinching. Great customer service plus Crap device still equals disappointed customer.Not recommended."
1,Horrible.,"I regret this purchase, I regret trusting it and I regret not calibrating it. Oh wait YOU CAN'T CALIBRATE IT. Mine is anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees off. It claims my bowl of ice water is 64 degrees and that water boils at 222 degrees. I believe that it's a major factor in the horrible efficiency of my home brewing operation."
1,Taylor won't back their products,I just called Taylor about my kitchen probe therometer that worked only three times. They told me they would be happy to SELL me another one. How magnanimous of them. I will not buy any product from Taylor again.
1,The probe seems to be the Achille's heel,"Mine started failing after one month.Many people complain that this sort of thermometer stops working randomly. All the incriminated models seem to share the same probe, so I believe the probe is the Achilles's heel of these tools.I've yet to understand what's going wrong with them, but it's no use changing model if they share the same probe."
1,Junk.,"Junk. This product inaccurately provided a read out for the 1st 10 minutes of use then merely stated ""lo"" thereafter. Too bad, I like the price but the quality was terrible. Amazon was quick to ship and willing to return for full refund."
1,look elsewere,I had an old version of this and it worked great for years. This new version only lasted 2 weeks. The probe is broken. A waste of money. Looking for a good high quality thermometer any sugestions?
1,Unreliable,"I have purchased 2 of these. Both have died the same death in about the same time frame. Less than 12 months, less than a dozen uses. The probes connection is poor. DO NOT TRUST THIS TO LAST!"
1,worked once,"bought this for turkey day, and after that, the timer stopped working. I changed the battery and nothing. Very disappointing in the quality of this. At least let the time work!"
2,Do not purchase this product,"This product is poorly made and I suggest you do not purchase it. Mine broke after just 6 months of use. I returned it to the manufacturer since it comes with a 1-year warranty and they sent me a new one. Only 5 months later, the new thermometer has broken in a different way. This time the sound stopped working completely, which is extremely dangerous since a key feature is that it beeps to alert you that your food has reached a certain temperature and I was using it on the stovetop when it broke. This defect could easily have resulted in a fire."
3,Don't put it on your refrigerator,The timer seems to work fine but after just a few months of use the magnets on the back lost there hold on the thermometer and stuck to the refrigerator. The result is that we now have a kitchen thermometer that will not stick to a metal surface as advertised. Bummer for people who like to keep their thermometer on the refrigerator or other metal surface.
1,useless probe = useless thermometer,"I used this thermometer for about 8 months, about 2-3 times a month. It was used for measuring the temp of milk for yogurt making. The probe quit, I have a fancy timer now. I am sure it would have quit earlier under demanding use. The cord is plastic so it cannot go into the oven. You got to wonder why a replacement probe and a new thermometer are the same price... Do not buy this one."
3,So so,"My temps are off by 7-8 F. No calibration feature, just knew by placing the probe in ice water and compared to another mercury based thermometer... Oh well."
1,Bad Thermometer,"I have had three of these, they are short lived.Bought the third, it is 35 degrees off(short).Used it to measure sausage temperature, thank god I did not believe the results.I checked with another thermometer and checked glass of ice water.Last one of these I am buying."
2,Worked 3 times .. And then it died,Was happy that it worked ...but then it died. Not happy...Will see to return it. Have bought a standard temp probe without cord
4,great for the price!,I got this for making bread. It worked really well when I used it last night. I watched it to make sure it would beep at the 190...I'm a dork!
1,Broken out of the box,Bought this for my girl friend for Christmas and she did have a need for it for a couple weeks. When she turned it on the first time all the possible number surfaces light up. Tried to reset or change settings but nothing causes it to change at all. Do not waste your time or money on this item.
2,Inaccurate,I bought 2 of these to make beer. It varies widely from my glass thermometer making it useless for this application.
2,Not reliable,"I've owned three Taylor 1470s. I picked the first one up around Thanksgiving of 2010, and cooked with it for about 6 months. It had all the features I was looking for; a long, flexible cable; timer or temperature alarms; and a magnetic back. I figured that even though it wasn't much of a looker, it would do just fine.Six months later, the probe stopped reading. The current temperature display would read ""Lo"" unless I had the cable's connector positioned *just right*. It was frustrating, but not the end of the world. Within two months, getting used no more than once a week, the thing stopped reading entirely. I trashed it, and picked up a replacement 1470 at Target. Three months later, the same thing happened. I trashed it again, and bought an OXO which my Mom decided would work great at her house, so away it went.I was back at Target a couple weeks ago, and picked up a third 1470 for some stupid reason. Three weeks(!!) later, and I'm seeing the same symptoms. This thing sucks."
1,Inconsistant at best,I have had 3 of these in the past few years and the last two were garbage bso QC seems to be an issure with this manufacturer.It is easy to use and the first one I bought was great and lasted for 2-3 years before it just quit working. The next two didnt read an accurate temperature so I suggest you look elswhere for a thermometer.
3,Probe replacements,How does one find replacement probes for thistheromornter. Can anyone give me an address.The probe failed. .....HELP......
3,themometer review,"I also love this thermometer, But had the same problem others have stated. The probe melted and it died. It was great while it lasted.(3 months)"
1,Just Long Enough...,"Had a chance to use at the BBQ and show all the neighbors just how cool I was the first time I used it... Lucky, becuase it never worked again. Like others I seem to have burnt a section of the cord and the temp is all over the place."
2,When will they get it right?,"I've owned at least 3 of these and in every single case, the sensor gives out after some period of time. Just tonight I tried to use the thermometer and when I turned it on, the temperature reading was 127 degrees. That's BEFORE I inserted it into the food. Other eviews state they have the same problem. Be very careful of this one. You could easily ruin a dinner."
2,Probes don't last,"As others have, my probes seem to melt and stop working after several uses. I had one last about a year and another last six months. Annoying."
2,Probe exploded off of wire on second use.,"I ordered this Thanksgiving of 2011 and for the first use it was great. But I tried to use it this past Saturday and the probe exploded off the wire in my turkey, the product is now useless and to get a replacement probe it costs just as much to just buy a whole new unit. It made a LOUD SSSPOP! noise, I thought my oven had exploded! almost gave me a heart attack! Useless, dont waist your money."
1,Did not work at all,"Neither my husband nor I could make it work. It displayed 8888888 but when we took out the batteries and put them back in, it worked briefly. When we turned it off and back on it didn't work,just displayed 8888888. It refused to respond to taking out the batteries and putting them back in.It's in the trash. Don't waste your money."
2,Won't buy another one,I got mine and out of the box it only read 208 in boiling water. As cheap as it is I can't warrant sending it back for replacement. Yes it comes with a great guarantee. But I'll spend as much to have it fixed as what I paid for it. I'll make it work until I get something that really works.
1,DEFECTIVE THERMOMETER DON'T BUY IT!,"I bought 3 Thermometers for Christmas presents, HOW EMBARRASING! After a couple of uses, I turned it on and it shoots right to HI and the irritating buzzer starts blairing! The other reviewers were too nice describing this problem. Find ANOTHER brand and buy it, because it is a great way to get a tempature."
1,Probes Wear out quickly,"This is my 3rd digi thermometer and this one burned our the fastest. Within only a coupl eof months the probe start reading 20 degrees higher than the real temp. They need to sell a bunch of probes as a supplement to this product. Timer still works, but it useless to me unless the probe works."
2,"Great while it works, which won't be long","I owned my Pyrex digital thermometer for years, but when I was brand new to grilling, I learned the hard way that you can't leave the thermometer in the grill with the lid closed like you do the oven (Duh, so obvious to me now)... Sooo, I replaced my melted thermometer with this Taylor 1470 digital thermometer. One year and one month after purchasing, with gentle/light use (and no grill use, period, hehe), it died on me. I am VERY upset that I've barely used this and now it's junk. I would go back to Pyrex, but I don't see them for sale anymore, so the hunt for a quality oven thermometer continues..."
1,Stopped working at Thanksgiving,"I used to trust this until it malfunctioned Thanksgiving and ruined my Turkey. I suppose I should have been paying less attention to Football, but I was listening for the alarm that never went off. This is the second unit I've had that stopped working. I don't know if it's a cheap probe or some other problem, but I'm done with this brand as it never seems to deliver accurate temps anymore."
5,I've had this for over four years,"Mine has worked for four years. I love it. I'm buying another for back up. It did have a glitchy period, I over heated it and the next few times I was getting screwy readings so I figured it was ruined, but after it sat for awhile I tried it again and it's been perfect ever since. I don't know how or why that happened, but except for that brief period it's been completely reliable."
4,Taylor vs Polar,"This works fine but is larger than the 10 year old Poldor it replaced. I bought it due to it's lower price. Remember that this model is not to measure oven temperature but the food in the oven. Also, that the probe/cable are not water proof when you clean them."
2,"great idea, in theory",The probe may last 1 cooking session or 3 years. I've been through 5 of them and finally asked the manufacturer why they keep going bad. Apparently you're not supposed to use the probes in a bbq or smoker.
2,Taylor Digi Thermometer,"Worked fine, when it wasn't broke. It lasted only 1 month, before it broke and became unusable."
2,Wears Out Quick,"The thermometer on this device wears out quickly and you cannot fully submerge the 'dipstick'. I would warn against this for brewing applications. I thought it would be good for mashtun and lauter tun temperature monitoring, but it did not work out. After being submerged once in the mash, the temperature readings were all way off and I found myself doing too much math to know what the real temperature was. Wanted something quick and easy, and this was not it.Might work better in basic cooking applications though, but couldn't say. A thermometer that you can't get wet is pretty useless to me."
3,LOVED it until it broke!,"Like others, I was thrilled with this product - in one weekend, I made candy with my children at about six different temperatures and everything came out perfect. We had fun doing science experiments with everything from the freezer to coffee - guess what the temperature is?Then I used it on pork chops on the grill, and once the chops reached 120 degrees, the thermometer beeped (it wasn't supposed to until 160 degrees), and registered ""HI"" as the current temperature.I emailed Taylor to ask them about the problem, and they are shipping me a new probe (FOR FREE) and will replace future ones for Now, I'm relatively satisfied. I have talked to others that use another brand of digital thermometer, and they haven't had the ""probe problem"" that this make seems to have. Seems to be a defect that the Taylor is trying to remedy, though!"
2,"Great item, but defective","This thermometer worked awesomely for about 6 months (used about once per month). Then, as another reviewer has mentioned, the temp reading stuck on the reading ""Hi"". It doesn't work anymore, even if I jiggle the cord like the other reviewer suggested. I tried changing battery, but no luck. And, to make matters worse, I can't find warranty information on Amazon (of course, I don't have the packaging anymore).Nicely designed item, poor durability."
2,Nice while it lasted,"I have purchased 2 of these units over the last year... Both have shorted out (I believe due to the aforementioned temperature issues). If the probe touches the grill or oven grate, see you later. They are fantastic when working, I just wish they could make them with some sort of circut breaker."
1,Disappointment,"The third time I used this digital oven thermometer the probe temperature stated to continuously read ""HI"". Other reviewers have reported the same problem so it looks like the probe thermocouple breaks down when it gets hot. I'm disappointed in Taylor, I always thought they sold quality products. I've dumped my Taylor oven thermometer, it isn't worth fooling around with it."
1,Don't buy!,"You get what you pay for, I guess. This thing doesn't work at all - my ancient stick-probe with the analog dial is way more accurate. This Taylor model registers 20-30 degrees higher than my old reliable. So sorry I didn't keep the packaging so I could return the thing."
2,Had 3 - all failed,"I've had three of these, and now own none. The first became erratic and untrustworthy; I complained to the manufacturer and they replaced it. The second worked for a while, then it, too, failed. Of course, it failed in the middle of a complex dinner when I was depending on the thermometer for an accurate reading. After several years, thinking that the technology might have improved, I bought a third. It lasted for two months, during which I used it about three times, then it failed. I returned it for credit.It seems like a good idea, and is useful when it works. The technology, it seems, is not up to the promise."
4,Is it done yet?!?,"This is a cool device. Works well, and is accurate. I have not used it enough to experience the probe failure many mention as a drawback, however. Barring that supposed eventuality, I highly recommend this unit for the experienced cook, and the inexperienced one."
2,Not for the BBQ,"Nice, inexpensive and compact. The hinge for the screen only has two options. One is too far down to see, the other two far up.That's not the real issue though.I used this on my propane grill (which was why I bought it) and it burned through the probe wire in a matter of minutes. It is still hanging on, but another couple of tenderloins and this is going to be done.Rather than bother with replacement probes, I'm just going to get a more durable model.This is probably good for oven usage."
1,"Arrived with screen damaged, never got to use it","This item arrived with the screen damaged, so I never got to use it. The screen shows up with all 8's on it and near the center of the screen, the numbers don't show up at all. Didn't get it returned within the ""return window"" and now I have to pay for return shipping and it just isn't worth it."
2,Worked great for a year,"The thermometer worked great for about a year and I was careful not to let it stay in the oven above 392 degrees, as the instructions stated. Lately the temperature has been jumping around: 250 degrees, then 310, then 180, all in in the space of a few seconds, so I assume the probe has malfunctioned. In the end I'd say that I got my money's worth since it lasted a year and I used it and the timer at almost every meal. But I'm going to look for better quality for my next purchase. The only question is, is there anything better made out there?"
1,Incorrect temperature reading,"I am not an experienced chef. I used this to determine temperature for a 14-pound turkey. I inserted the probe deep into the breat meat, making certain that it wasn't touching bone. The thermometer's temperature reading rose very rapidly, faster than I was led to believe with the recipe I was following. When it registered the target temperature, I had some experienced turkey cooks gauge how done the turkey was; they all agreed that it needed at least half an hour longer. When I finally removed the bird, the thermometer registered significantly higher than my target temperature, but the turkey was moist, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. I cannot recommend this product."
4,nice thermometer,"does a great job of reading temp quickly. only beef I have is that the housing around the display looked like it was spreading apart near where it hinges. However, this doesn't appear to affect functionality."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a thermometer to measure the temperature in our Smoker -- which has temps similar to an oven. This probe is really a MEAT thermometer -- measuring the temperature in the product, not the ambient temperature in the oven."
2,3 month Review,"This thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months, then the probe broke. Don't ask me how it broke because I cannot see inside the metal do-hicky. A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one.It seems all these units have problems with the probes. Well, enough for me. I'll go back to my traditional thermometer."
2,Great while it worked,"From the other reviews, I guess I was lucky to get 6 months out of my probe before it broke. Taylor will send me one free replacement -- in 2 months. While the remote feature is nice, most of the time I just need an instant read thermometer, so I'm going to get one of the digital instant read stick thermometers that Cook's Illustrated recommends. I'll save my remote probe thermometer for the times when I really need to have constant real-time temperature monitoring."
5,A must have,"If you don't own a digital thermometer, get one. I use it on fish, chicken, burgers, steak, potroast. I love not having to ""twist"" my fork to see if its done, or guess if my chicken is still pink inside. This specific thermometer is a great quality and very accurate."
1,Poor Quality,I did not use item right away. The on/off switch broke off during the second use. Returning costs were prohibitive.
1,This thing is a piece of junk,"Purchased for Thanksgiving to use to cook our turkey. Put it into the turkey and within and hour it was going off. reset it and again after an hour it went off again. perhaps i'm doing something wrong, but it doesn't seem that complicated."
5,A very necessary item in your kitchen,"I wouldn't cook without it. You have perfect results every time. My roast are always done to our liking. It's easy to use, too."
1,Digital Thermometer,"First, you cannot have the temperature of the oven above 350 degrees. There is a cord attached, the cord has frayed and is now broken after only using the thermometer twice. The two times I used it and it worked was great, the food came out perfect. I would invest more for something you would use often. This is cheap and I would not recommend it to anyone.Madeline"
5,so far only one flaw,This item has worked great and I give it 5 stars despite the ridiculous and painful noise it makes when you turn it on.
5,Great price for accuracy and safety while cooking!,I purchased this to replace a different brand which cost $40 and died after two years. Read the reviews and the item description of this model and decided it would fit the bill. Very happy with the purchase--works like a charm! Recommend this to others looking for a reasonably priced digital thermometer.
1,Don't Buy This!,"A couple months ago, I bought TWO of these digital thermometers for my daughter and BOTH broke already! One stopped working after using it only 2 times! She says the problem is with the probes. WHY WHY WHY did I waste my money! This is the first time I've ever written a review but I have to warn people not to waste their money on these things!! My daughter said: ""The ones you gave us recently have both broken (stopped reading temps - it always says ""lo"" or shows some absurd temperature and jumps around a bunch)."""
3,"Works great, but beware.","The best way to cook. I have been using them for years. Notice I said ""them"". I have tried Taylor, Polder & Accurite. ALL are made in China. All fail in 6-9 months. After 6 hours of my valuable time one day, I got a hold of Tech Support at an importer.The problem is the probe. You can not wash it, kink it or expose it to temperatures greater than 390 F. (My Webber says to pre-heat grill to 550!) Plan on buying many replacements and a life of 6 months each. Not many Web merchants have the probe in their shopping cart.Too bad no American company can do the technology right."
3,Temperature of boiling water,"I don't have this particular thermometer, so I can't comment on its quality, this comment is in response to the reviewer who said his thermometer was inaccurate because it measured boiling water at 208 degrees.The temperature at which water boils is affected by altitude; water only boils at 212 degrees at sea level. For every 500 feet above that, the temperature drops by one degree, so at 2000 ft above sea level water would boil at 208 degrees.Without knowing where the reviewer lives, it's certainly possible that the thermometer was accurate and the water was simply boiling at the lower temperature due to location."
1,Don't buy this item!,"After reading the other negative reviews I nevertheless bought this item and had the same problems with it that others described. I have returned the item, and have since bought an Oneida digital thermometer at Bed Bath and Beyond which, after about a month and at least a dozen uses, is still true to temperature and reliable."
3,Not impressed,"The original probe worked one time, it was a great piece of meat, the ""replacement probe"" I purchased along with it didn't even work when taken out of the package. Both probes now state the room temperature is about 105f in a room at 60f, and a glass of ice-water they report to be about 70 to 80f. You would think the manufacturer would provide adequate information for replacement probes, being they seem to be so fragile. You might even think they may come up with a way of manufacturing more sturdy probes. But I forgot, these were manufactured outside america, why expect it to work, otherwise if it were made in america it would come with the 6 pages of legalease that basically states you got what you paid and once you use it, any defects are your problem. Would be an nice gadget, if it actually worked and worked more than once. Otherwise, plan on spending $16 (adding in the probes) per pound to get a decently cooked piece of meat. It does make a handy kitchen timer."
1,junk,Taylor Digital Cooking Thermometer/TimerI would give this item a zero if possible. Probe died after about 8 months. Try to get a replacement probe from Taylor... you can't. I wanted to purchase three and they do not have them and could not tell me where to buy them.
1,not durable,"I loved the features on this thermometer like the temperature alarm, but I had it less than a year, used it less than a half dozen times and it broke Thanksgiving morning. Just stopped working. I opened it up to find a teeny tiny wire not sautered to the control panel (?) and threw it out. Very disappointed."
2,Needs better probes,I am on-line buying another probe - this has gotten to be quite a pisser!I really like the thermometer/timer but I am really tired of having to buy a new probe every 3-4 months.Taylor - take note and beef up your probes
2,More Chinese JUNK!,"While admittedly this worked for months, suddenly it became a pile of junk. Turned it on one day and the display went haywire. Every segment of the LCD display was activated but many of the individual ones were unlit. Changed batteries, same deal.Should have known that buying ANYTHING these days made in China is an exercise in foolishness destined to lead to a non working product."
1,Not worth the aggravation,"Forget it, you shouldn't have to buy probes more frequently than batteries, which is what ends up happening. Hold off until someone makes something that actually stands up to real cooking or buy a thermapen."
4,The darn thing is a whiz!,"We so loved this gadget that we ordered two more for the other cooks in the family. It is accurate, forgiving and simple to use. No more cutting and guessing whether the meat is done . . . and no more criticism from my spouse, at least about that."
2,FAiled after 8 months,"I have an older model that had lasted about 5 years, but the new replacement I bought only lasted 8 months. Very disappointed"
1,Garbage,"The thermometer arrived on time, but it doesn't work. The temperature display reads ""Lo"" regardless of temperature. I replaced the batteries and it still didn't work. I reset it - didn't work. I turned it off and on - didn't work. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the probe or the unit. Either way, it's brand new out of the box and doesn't work. Thanks, Taylor!"
1,Junk,This clunker stopped working on the first day. Try any other brand first. My Pyrex brand one was far better.
5,great inexpensive BBQ thermometer,Thermometer works as advertised. Very accurate. Registers 210 when placed in boiling water. Be careful not to get the housing to hot. I attached it to bbq smoker and it melted the battery latch. Batteries are taped on now but thermometer still works!
3,great gadget,"I love this little guy, very accurate, always works...except when the probe wire breaks. I have owned four in four years. Would give it 5 stars if that darn wire was a bit sturdier!"
3,"Very handy, not very sturdy","It's all true. A digital thermometer is an indespensible tool for the kitchen. This one works great for a while, and then starts giving erroneous results, so beware.The digital timer feature is handy, although not very well done. It makes a raucous noise when you turn it on. And setting the time is a bit inconvenient as you can't reduce the amount of time.Although the metal wire and probe and temperature alarm feature might make you think you can leave the probe in your food while it's cooking, DON'T. The probe will conduct heat into the middle of your food much faster than the meat will, and so the meat around the probe will get cooked and the probe will tell you (totally accurately) that the meat is done, it's only referring to the meat right next to the very hot probe. The rest of your meat is not yet cooked."
4,"A great tool, just don't get it wet","I've had this model of thermometer for a couple of years now and have really come to rely on it. I use it for everything from baking bread to deep frying french fries. It's a sturdy tool provided that you remember two things:1) The body of the thermometer is not heat or water proof, so be careful where you stick it.2) The probe is not water proof, so be careful not to submerge it."
1,Nice feature but short lived,This would be a great product if the probes lasted longer. I've been through two of these now and the probe on both of them died after a half dozen uses or so.
3,"""Probing"" the problem","As noted by many other reviewers here, the weak link in the chain is the temperature probe, which cannot withstand continuous oven temperature exposures over 350 degrees F.Lots of oven cooking occurs at higher temps, so this is a genuine limitation (not mentioned anywhere in the instruction manual).Another piece of junk added to the post-consumer waste pile."
5,Cooking is a whole lot easier,I use this thermometer in the oven and on my propane grill. I've improved my cooking considerably since getting this. I've had no problems with the thermometer or any part of it. It works great and accruately.
1,Poor quality device - don't buy,"I bought two of these and one didn't work out of the box. Not only didn't the unit register any temperature, but the probe didn't work either (I tried in the other unit that worked)."
2,Probes are flaky,"I really loved the accuracy and convenience and price of this unit, but I cannot recommend it since the probes last such a short time. I have owned mine for about a year, but I only use it for roasts and turkeys, so it's only been used about 6 times. Now the cord has come out of the probe (in spite of gentle use) and I cannot locate a replacement. Silly to have to replace the entire unit. Even at their low price, it's kinda dumb that the probe doesn't outlast the battery!"
2,Didn't last long,"I used this thermometer maybe two dozen times. It appeared to work well while it was working. I am a fussy cook and followed the Taylor's instructions. It now reads ""hi"" no matter what I probe. I cannot recommend this thermometer given its short life."
4,Taylor thermometer,"This product has worked well I wish it had a greater temperature range , it is accurate and one I have recommended."
4,Better in a way.,"I bought this thermometer to cook my thanksgiving diner. I have not done that yet. But, I'm sure it will work just fine. Considering when I turned it on it read 72 degrees in seconds (which is what I keep my home thermostat on)So, I don't think it will have any problems reading the temperature correctly. But,What I was disappointed about was my old thermometer had a place to wrap the cord around. Though the old on did not have a timer. I suppose I could have shopped around more. But, It will probably stay in drawer until next thanksgiving anyway. It does look nice and I love how it the display tilts."
1,Are these all defective?,"I guess I should have read these reviews before ordering. The SECOND time I used my thermometer, the temperature reading was stuck on ""HI."" I've tried the obvious remedy (cleaning the plug) but to no avail. Based on all the other reviewers who have this problem, it appears that this device is junk. Now it's too late to return, so another Chinese-made piece of junk goes to the landfill. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,Overdone Prime rib,"I purchased this thermometer with the hopes of a perfect medium prime rib. With all the special features, I thought this would be perfect for our dinner. Unfortunately, the internal temp was wrong. The thermometer read 100 degrees farenheit. We decided to recheck it in another area of the roast, the temp read 148, so we removed the prime rib to what I thought was medium well to well. I guess this thermometer gives you a general idea of the temp but this was after we played around with the probe a bit. I would not recommend this for roasts."
2,To short of a life for a good product.,"The Taylor cooking thermometer worked great for about two years then one day I stuck it in my chicken and it read (LO) which ment it was below 32 degree. But I knew my chicken we about 150 degree. I tried and tried it again and again, Even changed the batteries but it still would not read right. Now it is in the garbage. Just more garbage made in china that never lasts like it should. They make these products in other country's to save money and take jobs from Americans. Oh yeah they save money but we don't. Not in the long run. We have to buy more stuff more often because it does not last long. I'm sure making this product would not pay alot but having a job is better then no job at all. I think this product would of lasted about 10 to 15 years if it was make in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And not in china."
2,Sensor goes bad,I've used three of these for homebrewing and if the sensor even goes anywhere near a flame or over boiling temperature it dies and never gives a good reading afterwards.
1,didn't read temps accurately on arrival,"I got this thermometer for home cheesemaking and it read about 30 degrees too high the first time I used it. It becomes tiresome to get things new that are poorly made and have to spend the shipping to return them if you want a replacement. Given that it didn't work on arrival, I'm not crazy about getting a replacement. I just have to hope it will work better. There should be a law that requires the manufacturer to pay for the return. Then they might not make such crap.I've now been waiting a few weeks and still no word on a replacement for the returned item. Apparently Taylor has poor customer service as well."
4,"Seems to work, but a little loud","After purchasing other thermometers, I stuck with this one. The biggest problem is that when you turn it on or change the temperature it makes an obnoxious beep. If there is a way to turn the sound off, I can't figure it out. Also, I wish that it went up to a higher temperature so I can use it for broiling."
3,"Nice Convienence, but needs extra Probe","I bought this so I could smoke on my Weber One Touch Gold and not have to take the lid off to check the internal temperature of the meat. And for that, it worked fine a few times. Very satisfied.The trouble came when I tried to use this for a roast in the oven. I inserted the probe into the meat and closed the oven door. Then I attempted to use the magnets on the back to mount the display on the oven..... That did not work at all. The display fell on the ground and the probe wire sheared, which rendered my probe useless. This really made me angry. I'll probably buy another probe and I'd recommend everyone else do the same.The actual device worked fine until I broke the probe."
2,Never really pleased,"Purchased the thermometer/timer to replace our previous thermometer. I thought the probe had gone bad but decided to go with this lower priced therm/timer as a replacement. It worked okay for a few months. The default temperature was set at 122 degrees and would always beep like crazy when I turned it on. We started using the timer as a ""time-out"" timer but this feature only lasted for a couple weeks (used about once a day) and then the buttons to set the timer and start/stop quit working. Now we use the probe in our other thermometer (that we bought from Walmart) and it works great!"
5,Works great,"I've been using this now for about 4 months and it works great. I use it mostly just for making meatloaf, but it is very convienant because I can make whatever size meatloaf I want and don't have to worry about figuring out how long to cook it for. Every meatloaf turns out to perfect doneness...this product does exactly what I wanted it to do."
2,"Price was right, thermometer was wrong","I purchased this thermometer for homebrewing. The relationship started off well, but soon the bottom fell out and I find myself in the market for a better model. Taylor is touchy, fussy, inaccurate, and not always willing to show you what you want to see: the current accurate temperature. For the short time we were together and things were working out, it really was nice, but it faded so quickly."
2,Works well... until it breaks,"Had this for 4 months before it stopped working. Changed the batteries, changed the probe - still doesn't work. I agree with other reviewers: it's too expensive for a disposable thermometer. Great idea, but poor execution."
1,Bad Choice,"Don't buy this unit..... as previously stated, the chord to the probe is extremely flimsy. I'm on the second one and they only last for year-or- less. My unit has a life time warranty, but I can't get Taylor to return my calls (have tried 4 times with no response!) ... I think this company is in financial difficulties, probably from making such a sorry probe which they advertise as ""made to our exacting specifications in China"" !"
1,Worked once,"I was hoping I would get one of the good ones with the good reviews, but I didn't. I used this for chicken one night. It didn't work at first (the LCD said 'low' temp), but I finally did get it to work after sticking the probe deeper in. After that it's been a struggle to get it to do anything. It does not take correct temperature. I put it in a glass of really hot water and it still said 'low'. I tried another probe I use for my crock pot and it didn't work. So whatever the problem is, it's not the probe but the machine itself. I tried taking out the batteries and putting them back in and it did take a temperature correctly for a second. Then it stopped working again. I'm going to try new batteries once again before I throw it away.Bottom line - don't waste your money. There is a chance you'll get a good one, but you also have a chance to get a POS. I'm going to order a plain thermometer. It won't be as fancy, but at least it will work."
1,Just Junk!,This is Junk! I used it three times and had a complete failure. The first thing to go was the magnet. Then the timer and finally the display went blank and that's' all she wrote. don't waste your money on this cheap piece of junk spend the few extra bucks on something else.DON'T DO IT!
1,Don't go there.,"I purchased two of these, admittedly for commercial use. Neither unit lasted a week and my use of them was not harsh or demanding, but socket where the probe connects with the unit is very flaky. That connection went bad on both units very shortly after I began to use them. The digital read-out gave the indication ""Lo"", which is the same response you get with the probe disconnected. I would steer clear of this one."
1,Beware !,"I've had two of these. Both lasted about 6 months. I didn't do any to the things Taylor warns against. I didn't expose the thermometer to water: direct heat or sunlight: I didn't get the sensor plug wet: I didn't use in an oven with temperature higher than 300F: I didn't allow probe to directly contact bone or use in a microwave. Warantee requires you to send back to Mexico which is expensive. when I emailed Taylor Customer Service for permission to return to a USA address, I received no response."
1,Not Happy With It,"I bought this, and didn't work when it arrived.I figured out that the one I had simply had a bad switch on it, so I went to Target and bought another one.That one stopped working during my first use.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.It ain't happening a third time."
1,Broken!,"I bought 5 of them for my co-workers at work. So far after only less than 6 months, 2 of them are broken already. We use it to make gelato. It doesn't register the temperature anymore. It only says ""Lo""While my friend's thermometer keeps blinking and blinking and sometimes it's just dead!I don't know what to say..."
2,Died fairly quickly,"I have had this thermometer for a little over a year. I really liked the temperature alert, and the fact that I can also use it as a timer. It was been working great until one day when it inexplicably decided that room temperature is 146 degrees. so now it's useless for me, and I'll be shopping for a different thermometer in the future."
3,60's Rock 'n' Roll,"This album could also be named ""oldies for beginners"". Most of the songs on the album are decent songs, and all of them would be easy to find on other collections of 60's rock 'n' roll. This album is worth buying because there are some good songs on it and because it is so cheap!"
3,just a try,i guess it worked ok i will not get any more cause i didnt think it was worth the money i spent on it didnt make any inprovements like they said it would
5,Did well with it,"I used to own a small limo company in Chicago. We put on a lot of miles and burnt a lot of gas.I added Motorkote to a 1996 Lincoln Town Car. The next day the driver called over the radio asking""What did you do to this car? It takes longer to warm up and it's got more pep.""From the time I bought my vehicles, I kept records of all the fillups, mileage, and gallons put in the tank, so I had several years worth of data before putting in Motorkote. I have used this in 2 Town Cars, a 1999 Ford E-450 minibus, and a 1999 Mercury Grand Marquis. On average, a .2-.5 MPG increase was achieved, which I am ecstatic about. I got 456,000 miles out of the original engine on the minibus, which I attribute to the Motorkote."
5,Great game,"This is one of my favorite SNES titles, itwas a very nice adition to my collection.Specially been a blizzard game."
5,Beautiful platter!,"I love this set - I'm not a dishes person usually, but this platter & set are beautiful!!"
5,for the holidays,the serving tray I bought is JUST what was needed for THANKSGIVING and CHRISTMASTHANKS so much ya'll
5,the restless heart,great insight into the effects of loneliness i.e. restlessness and how to turn it positive. knowledge and understanding is the key.
2,sentimental religion for older readers,"This is a reprint, and it reads like one. It's over twenty years old, and I could tell. It has a very sentimental feel. My best friend read it also and didn't like it at all. He described its tone as ""emotionalistic"" and ""effeminate"". I can see why. The author tries hard to convey lots of warm and fuzzy feelings for readers, but it just doesn't seem to work. Personally, it reminds me of how my over-fifty friends talk about life; they seem to be stuck in the 1960's."
2,Shoddy,"this timer worked fine for a few weeks, but now it ""freezes up"" constantly, so you can't change any of the settings, pressing the buttons has no effect. You have to take out the battery and put it back, which means you have to reset the clock. Not worth the bother."
2,Ditto - 5 minute warning beep doesn't work.,"We purchased a timer (not Taylor brand) about 6 years ago and it had a 5-minute warning beep. We LOVE that feature... We can put a casserole in the oven and go on to other things. Five minutes before it's ready, the timer beeps to let us know it's time to clean off the kitchen table & get ready for supper!We liked it so much we decided to buy two more from Amazon.com. Neither of the timers had a working 5-minute warning beep. I returned them to Amazon and the customer service assured me that somehow the two units I received must not work, because nobody else had complained. I ordered two more from Amazon, but those also did not have a 5-minute warning beep. I emailed Amazon about it, but they seem to have their heads up their ----- and won't look into the issue."
3,Works OK,"Bought three of these for my lab more than a year ago. Two of them are still working. I would say they are OK value for the money, although a little big and clumsy. Timer (only one), stop watch and clock all work fine. Alarm is loud enough. There are probably better deals out there so I will only give this a neutral recommendation."
1,Keep Looking,"Nothing against Amazon, but this is perhaps my most disappointing purchase. The manufacturer's printed instructions seem to have been written by someone who isn't fluent in English; they're not easy to understand and aren't complete, either. (Either the timer I got is broken, or there is no way to turn this thing off once it beeps... you have to remove the battery to silence it. And the instructions don't tell you how to silence it, either)There are lots of other timers out there... look for a better one than this."
2,out of step,"Everybody else seems to give this book high marks, but I was a little disappointed. The subtitle indicated that the book would be about building a ship. I didn't find that completely true. There are a few descriptions of the early stages of the construction and a wonderful description of the launch, but not much in between. Sanders spends a third of the book describing the Navy crew and some collateral issues that may have been intersting, but not really about building a ship. I wonder if any of my co-reviewers remember any discussion about installing the machinery or putting on the propellers. To be brief, I think the book lacks focus. According to the jacket, this is the author's first work. He has edited books previously. OK, so we give him some slack here, but maybe he should have spent some time in editing his own work."
3,Hard to read,"I've only made it to page 50 and don't know if I can continue. For a guy that makes a living as an author he has seen fit to exclude any quotation marks in this book. Sometimes I'm halfway through a paragraph before I realize that it is actually a quote from somebody that I am reading (or is supposed to be a quote). The back cover shows that he was formerly a book editor. Ha! I am not an English Grammer major, but it is difficult for me to read something that is incorrectly written."
4,"A thorough, almost too detailed look at shipbuilding","Michael Sanders obviously fell in love with his subject, the building of a U.S. Navy destroyer at the Bath Iron Works. At times the result of this romance is more detail than the reader might want.Sanders delves into every aspect of contemporary warship construction. He's done his homework, conveying an almost easy familiarity with the engineers, managers and sailors who contribute to the building of the USS Donald Cook. It is indeed a fascinating story of complex engineering, construction techniques that beggar the imagination, fastidious attention to detail and devotion to the job. Overall it's an excellent book. But sometimes I do admit that my eyes glazed over with the wealth of detail.Jerry"

4,A very fun single,Awesome single this oneThe title track is probably the best single release off 65-95.You finally get rolled in cd form which is a remix of Curse of Kazaar with elements of feel like makin love.Then you get the fruity track which a remix of the presidents of the USA song 'peaches'.A very fun single with upbeat happy tunes to sit back and relax to.
1,Warning,"I have a new Philips 26"" Flat Screen TV. Although this product is made well and supplies an assortment of screws, it is too small to fit on my TV. There are six screw holes on the back of the TV. Horizontally the wall mount is too short for the second hole. I would caution anyone purchasing it to measure the distance between the center screw holes on their TV and compare it to the mount. It is also not 10""X 8"" as advertised, it is 5-3/4""H X 4-3/4""W."
4,¡Interesante y romántico!,"Un libro muy interesante. Una novela del oeste, con los vaqueros. Hay peligro y drama también. (PRIMER LIBRO DE LA MINISERIE: LOS GENTRY) Historias sobre la familia Gentry.Escribo en español muy peor. ¡Lo siento! Leo mucho mejor y tengo gusto de este libro.This was a pretty good book. It was one of the first books I've read in Spanish for a long while. It was about a woman hiding from a murderous thug on this guy's ranch. Of course they fall in love! Yeah. It was pretty good. One of the series of books by Linda Conrad (about the Gentry family) called ""Los Gentry."" Collect the others in the series! I am!"
2,"""Perfect Media Voice"" Does not Make for the Best Memoir","I was very relieved to see the other frustrated reviews on this book. I picked it up after seeing it hyped in some media outlet, and I was so aggravated reading it that I had to check Amazon's reviews to find out if I was the only one having difficulty finishing it after getting halfway through it. She talks about a colleague mentioning her ""perfect media voice."" That's great and all for magazine or PR, but it's hardly the tone you expect from something as personal as a memoir. There are also WAY TOO MANY sentences beginning with ""For"" (""For I was not only a girl who thought she was going to a party but who found herseld out in the cold...""). Good thing the book is short."
1,How did this ever get published???,"Vanity press? Because of her grandfather's fame? Because it's really, trite, banal, and BORING. She goes here, goes there, blah blah blah. I don't mind books where not much happens or someone goes on and on about their process regarding the events of their lives...this book just doesn't have that IT quality that it takes be compelling."
2,cry me a river...,"I found this book to be sort of a cross between ""Prozac Nation"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada""... and not in a good way. Like Elizabeth Wuertzel, Ms. Saroyan is quite privileged and successful. Her complaining throughout the book was hard to get through. Her anecdotes were long-winded and most could (should?) have been trimmed extensively. Like ""The Devil Wears Prada"", this book didn't make the magazine world sound like a good place for us mere mortals. I guess it was nice of Ms. Saroyan to give me a peek into her world... but I'm quite happy to step back into my own world which is filled with plenty of real people."
1,Perhaps the worst book ever published,"This book is awful... Saroyan's wanderlust in writing is neither intelligible or enlightening. While lyrical in some sense, the text piles several non-consequential stories without order or point into 193 pages of the most expensive firewood ever produced. If you're interested in a good memoir, invest in ""The Liar's Club"" or ""Cherry"" by Mary Karr."
2,"Sometimes Interesting, More Often Just Boring","This book was a frustrating read because I oftentimes related to what Saroyan was discussing (especially her detailed exploration about how we grow apart from good friends as we get older) but more often I just wanted to set the book down and never pick it up again. After a while, I just was tired of hearing about her exploits with this person, or that boy, or this friend. The book felt to me like the kind of conversations you have with your friends after a couple of beers: You think that you are being quite deep and insightful, and sometimes you are, but more often you are talking just to hear the sound of your own voice."
5,interior design ideas from the Far East,"We recently returned from Bali with a container of furniture but then we wanted to know how to arrange the furniture in our home...this book shows you how by showing arrangments in homes all over Tropical Asia. Great stuff! If you want to chat about this, my email is globalcooling@hotmail.com"
5,Absolutely does the job,Absolutely does the job. I use as additive for shaving soap. Quite satisfactory and highly recommended. Considerably less expensive than at the corner drug store.
3,"Good product, grossly overpriced","Wilton, like their distributor Michael's, offer a great line of products, most of them, not all, of good quality, all of them grossly overpriced. I got 16 fl ounces of a great quality glycerin also at Amazon for less than these 2 ounces from Wilton."
5,It is exactly what it is!,I can't give it any less than 5 stars because I got exactly what the product is! It worked for what I needed it for and I still have plenty of it left! Thanks!
5,Excellent!,"This textbook is an excellent resource, whether you are just being introduced to the topic of criminology or whether you have studied it before."
4,Pleased!,The book was received promptly and in good condition. Condition was noted exactly as it was when purchasing the book..... Notes said book had some wear and highlighting and it did. Overall this was a great purchase as it is good to know details of the condition when purchasing and the book worked for what I needed. I would reccommend this seller.
5,Excellent!,Easy to follow and easy to understand all-you-ever-wanted-to-know regarding hormonal balance and treatment. A must read for every woman!
4,good book for symptoms of hot flashes,"good for anyone going through menopause. helpful tips on hot flashes and natural ways to combat symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings."
3,Not lots of info.,"Each book claims that hormones vary monthly during perimenopause but each book recommends getting hormones tested. It's confusing....if hormones vary so dramatically month to month what can the test tell you? I thought to compensate this author would have symptoms that you could check off to see monthly how one's hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone) varied. But the author does not provide enough info. for this."
5,"Solid Information, Solid Advice!","I am 41, already have osteoporosis, and was in desperate need of some reliable information on hormone therapy. I read this book from cover to cover like a novel. It makes hormones and their effects so much easier to understand. Now I know how to recognize deficiencies and excesses of the most important hormones. Based on Dr. Reiss's recommendations for working with a physician, I found a doctor that understands my needs, conducted thorough testing, and is prescribing exactly what I need. I bring this book with me to the doctor's office, and I refer to it regularly now. It's going to be one of the most well-used books in my home library. Thank you, Dr. Reiss!"
3,"Agree, But Disagree","I agree with Reiss that if we take hormones at all, they should be natural hormones, and unfortunately, so many women suffer from menopausal symptoms that hormonal replacement seems to the the only answer or relief. I suffered from day and night hot flashes, skin conditions, and a lousy mood as I entered menopause. I actually went to a western medical doctor, something I totally disagree with. They wanted to put me on premarin, and/or anything else I would take to fatten their kickbacks. Luckily, I was referred to a holistic health consultant trained originally by Native Americans. She showed me how to get in balance without hormones, and I'm fine. This book, and many like them, should be read with caution. When doctors write books, it's the same to them as writing a prescription. Forget the cures, find the cause. When the cause is eliminated, there's no need for a cure. Read Gangi, then add this as a follow-up."
2,Sales tool,"I found this book to be more of a sales/marketing tool for bio-identical hormones more than anything else. It contains some good information, but don't use it as your only reference. Read something from the other perspective as well."
2,Ok book ....I've read better....,"I read at least 30-40 books a year...Natural Hormone Balance for Women: Look Younger, Feel Stronger, and Live Life with Exuberance...I keep the best ones...and then like this one I donate to the public library!~"
2,Not so hot!,"This item although seemingly designed right for its uses, is not all that well made. After our very first use with this thermometer, the numbers rubber right OFF when cleaning! With just your fingertip they would rub away. Non-abrasive things caused this which makes me wonder what an abrasive fabric would do?Would not recommend this item if you plan on using it frequently. Designed with the user in mind maybe, maybe not. The numbering thing needs to be taken care of.I would look towards a different product to purchase unfortunately."
1,Useless without numbers,"My old candy/frying thermometer broke. I had liked it so much, I replaced it with the same type, this one. Unfortunately, they are no longer good quality. I have only had this a few months and the numbers are fading. A thermometer without numbers is useless. Don't buy this thermometer."
1,Not thrilled.,"This item is so large I don't have a pan that will allow what I am making come up to the mark where they want the food to come up to for a good reading. My candy totally flopped, was expensive and had to be thrown out. Very disappointed."
1,Disappearing numbers,"For 30 years my older style Taylor candy thermometer worked like a charm (until I broke it in the sink), so I had no hesitation about replacing it with the same thing but talked myself into a littl more expensive nicer looking model. After making only a couple batches of fudge and penuche I noticed the numbers are flaking away. They are bold and large but I can see that won't make a difference if they all disappear. The steam from the boiling candy seems to soften them so they flake right off. It does have a heavy duty clip and the bulb of the thermometer is well protected but that's the only good thing I can say. It also is less accurate (water boils at 204 instead of 212 degrees on it)."
1,Poor Quality,"Numbers came right off the scale into the candy I was making. Impossible to avoid because the scale must be submerged in order to read. Had to throw out the thermometer and the candy too.Also, the reading was a bit off, it indicated a hard crack and it definitely wasn't past the ball stage.Apparently, from reading other reviews, these problems are not uncommon.I would definitely op for the higher priced digital candy thermometer at this point."
3,Not great for candy making,"This was much more accurate than my digital thermometer but it needs more liquid than I had while making candy. I'll try to double the recipe next time to see if that makes a difference, and I'm sure it's fantastic with frying, but the single batch of caramel just didn't have the depth this needed to be really accurate."
1,Innacurate! Waste of money!,"Just picked up this thermometer today at Target for my first caramel-making experience. The recipe said to heat the mixture until it reached 248 degrees Fahrenheit, but the caramel started to burn when the thermometer only read 200! Completely worthless. I would have been better off just guessing based on the color of the mixture.Needless to say, I will be shopping around for one that actually works."
1,At a loss!,"The temp numbers are GONE! I was having such great luck with it, now I am clueless as to how hot ANYTHING IS. Another reviewer stated she thought the steam eradicates them....I agree!"
1,Numbers Washed Off First Time I Cleaned It,The thermometer did its job but I only got one use out of this product because when I washed it the numbers just wiped right off. (I hand washed it with dawn dish soap and a soft sponge.) I am extremely disappointed.
3,Not ideal for tempering chocolate,"I bought this for making chocolates, but was disappointed that the lowest temperature that is marked is 100 F, which is too high for tempering chocolates. When tempering chocolate, you melt it at 105 F, but then cool it to 80-90 F (depending on the variety of chocolate) before working with it. While you can more-or-less eyeball it, I was disappointed that it didn't include markings for temperatures below 100 F. It seems accurate enough has handy markings for the various candy stages, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for."
1,Could have been great...,"I used this four times before all writing disappeared off of the thermometer. It was nice the first two times, then practically impossible to use. Now it is useless =/Otherwise it is sturdy and I like the adjustable clip. This would have been perfect for my needs had it simply stayed legible."
1,Great until the numbers disappeared,"This was a great frying thermometer until all the markings eventually got washed off. It lasted several months and withstood many washings, but then all the temperature markings just started disappearing...now I'm left with with a a thermometer that technically works, but is really worthless."
2,Questionable quality,"After only one use and a soaking/washing by hand, the markings have begun to smear and wear off. The thermometer is otherwise fine, but it won't be much use if the numbers become unreadable."
1,What happened to my markings and scale?,"I made two batches of toffee and after the second batch was finished, I noticed the bottom readings under 212 degrees had disappeared or smeared. I opened my second unit and tried it on another batch of toffee and the numbers and scale began to smear from the steam at the hard crack stage. I read the Caution on the package before using and did not scrub the thermometer as they recommended and just soaked it to loosen the toffee before using again. I find it hard to believe that you can wash these in the dishwasher when the paint smeared so quickly. The thermometer is worthless without the markings on it. I think I will stick with Wilton's thermometers since their markings and numbers are engraved into the holder. I have requested a refund and will be submitting my request and returning my products soon to Amazon."
1,candy thermometer,this didn't last very long. Bought it at the end of June and it broke begining of September. It got air bubbles in the mercury. Not sure if i would recommend this thermometer.
1,waste of $5/10. buy something else,positives: works.cons:- letters/numbers can't be seen after 3 washes. I can't read it anymore and have to guess what temperture i am at.- you have to look at it at just the right angle or you will not see the line.waste of time even looking at this item and have had 3 bad experiences with Taylor products. Their thermometers are too slow and dont last.
1,"My numbers washed off, too.","Like many other reviewers here, the numbers on my thermometer washed off the first time I used it. Useless."
3,Taylor Classic Candy Thermometer,I use this product frequently the only problem is that the lettering rapidly wipes away.
1,Expected more from Taylor,"When I purchased this thermometer, I checked the calibration with boiling water, and found it to be spot on. But the first time I washed it in normal soapy water (no dishwasher; no abrasives) the ink legend came right off. Now I have an accurate thermometer, but I have no idea what it is telling me. I purchased the Taylor brand expecting their commercial quality. But this is more of a dollar store product. Stay away, and save your money."
5,Sturdy Candy Thermometer,"I love how protected the glass dial is on this thermometer. The ""stay cool"" handle on the top is great, as is the height of the thermometer. Some of the less expensive thermometers are hard to use in deep stock pots because they don't reach the liquid. The adjustable clip for attaching the thermometer to the side of a pot slides very easily. There is metal section on the bottom of this thermometer that acts as a barrier between the bottom of your pot and the glass temperature dial; this is great because it can sometimes be hard to see how close you are to the bottom of your bot."
1,Becomes useless after washing,"I've used this thermometer twice for deep frying. The temperature never went above 360. The scale is now gone after washing. If the metal frame was etched, I wouldn't be concerned. And, had I known the scale would wash off, I would have etched it myself. But this thing is now junk and relegated to the trash can. Pretty expensive for a disposable thermometer."
4,Dependable Thermometer,"I got this temperature indicator because I needed one that immersed in the hot oil without hitting the bottom of the pan and was protected from breakage. I also needed one that responded quickly to temperature changes and this one does just that. The cost was reasonable, while others seemed way overpriced."
3,Disappointed,"I know that thermometers can be tricky but when I calibrated this thermometer before it's first use it was off by 12 degrees. It seems sturdy and I think I would love it but I bought a new thermometer because my old one has been off lately and I've heard great things about this Taylor model. I guess I'm just lazy and I don't like to have to do math to figure out temperatures when I""m cooking."
1,Temperature off,"The temperature is 20 degrees too low, and I don't see a way to calibrate it.My first few items (caramel and jam) didn't come out properly because of the temp difference.I now just add 20 degrees to it.If you buy this check that the temp is correct!"
1,Do not purchase this!,"I used this thermometer one time to fry shrimp. I 'hand' washed it. The next time I went to use it, I noticed that the liquid that measures the temperature was separated and also the numbers that were submerged in oil disappeared!! Yes, probably into my food. I contacted Taylor USA and they told me to ship it back at MY expense and they would replace it once they received it. They really didn't care that my family ate ink in our food! Also, she told me to shake it to make the liquid in the thermometer to join together again. At first she said that it must have leaked out!! If it leaked out, that meant that the glass was broken! Apparently that customer service rep doesn't know her product. Order a different one! Not by Taylor!"
1,Taylor Classic Candy and Deep-Fry Analog Thermometer,Taylor Classic Candy and Deep-Fry Analog ThermometerThis is not the first time that I have bought a Taylor Candy Thermometer so I was very surprised when after using it the first time with Olive Oil.After letting it cooled down I took Paper Towel to wipe the oil off and some the of number's just disappeared.I am having a hard time finding a complain dept at Amazon to write to it about it. After the holidays I will contact Taylor.
4,Great for the price,"I had to come back and edit my review, I earlier gave it 4 stars now I don't give it any, the people complaing about the writing coming off are right. I thought they were doing something wrong so I really babied minejust in case. I used it 12 - 15 times no problem but 3 months out the writing is coming off. No pick another one!!!!"
2,"Okay initially, but not for dishwasher","I ordered this thermometer 2 years ago from Amazon. It registers a little low, but I learned to compensate after several failed batches of fudge. In a cleaning frenzy, my son put it into the dishwasher. The printed scale and lettering on the side has faded and now cannot be read. I re-marked the settings that I needed, but it certainly is not dishwasher safe."
4,"good product, bad packaging","Let me start by saying,I've been buying off Amazon for a number of years. There is no longer a place to comment about Amazon shipping, so I have to do it here. I got this candy thermometer for my wife as a Christmas present and the thermometer looks like it will be okay (I hope). The package that it came in was so poorly done I was suprise that it wasn't broke. If this had been my first purchase from Amazon, it probably would have been my last. As I said this comment is not about the thermometer as much as it is about the fall of Amazon. I'm hoping they get better, I'd hate to have to move my business to someplace else."
1,Exploded when deep frying & company didn't label whether or not had mercury,"I bought the thermometer and used it for deep frying, and I didn't realize that I put up the heat too high (on half-way) and the thermometer exploded at the bottom and whatever liquid seeped out. Now the package doesn't even say if it has mercury or not in it and I hope not because I would have breathed in the fumes! Other reviews say that the paint rubs off so between these 2 issues, I would NOT buy this thermometer. Not even the website says if it has mercury or a non toxic substance inside. Seems like a crappy company not to put that important information on."
4,Nice but not Taylor,Order this because it was a Taylor Brand but when it came it was something else but looked just like the Taylor Brand. Haven't used it yet but should be good.
1,Don't buy this thermometer!,"I purchased 8 of these thermometers for my foods class at a major midwestern university. Most arrived with the red alcohol temperature indicator having separated. I tried repeatedly to consolidate the liquid by placing them in a freezer followed by placing in an oven to no avail. I even tried spinning them at the end of a rope (the equivalent of placing them in a centrifuge) with no effect. The one thermometer where the fluid did not separate was used in one lab where we made peanut brittle. When the thermometer was cleaned, the numbers on the stainless steel backing came off. This purchase was a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere for a usable candy thermometer. I purchased digital ones to use in the food lab."
1,Not a good choice.,"The first sign of trouble was that the clip kept falling off. It fell off when I took it out of the package, and every time I picked it up. I tried to make it tighter, but it wasn't possible. It fell off in the caramel I was cooking.The next problem was that I overcooked two kinds of candy because the temperature must have been incorrect. These were the only two batches of candy I made using this thermometer. It broke while I was washing it after the second use. I was carefully handwashing it and the tip broke off. I have used a cheap glass thermometer for years and never had one break. I am now using my old cheap one again."
1,"Not accurate, difficult to read","I had this sitting in the drawer for months and finally pulled it out while making fudge. I cross tested with my Thermapen and the temp was significantly off. 5-10 degree it seemed.Also, the readout was hard to gauge. There's such a wide range, it's difficult read without sticking your face up to it, which of course means your face is over molten hot sugar or oil. Also, while it kind of seems like a good idea, the readout lists the candy making stages for soft/hard crack etc, but it removes numbers for the labels.I'll keep this around for frying where I'm not that concerned with the temps, but for candy making I'll stick with the Thermapen."
1,Numbers disappeared,I used my Taylor candy thermometer for a few years and yesterday I managed to wipe off the numbers. Quite a surprise. Cooking thermometers should be safely washable and the numbers a PERMANENT part of the device. BEWARE.
1,temp is way off and numbers wash away,"Don't waste your money on this one. I bought one of these three years ago and tried to make candy with it. Nothing worked right and I decided I just wasn't good at making candy and gave up. At that time I accidentally washed the numbers most of the way off with a soft washcloth in warm soapy water. I noticed before they were completely gone so I can still just read them. If it had worked otherwise I would give it two stars. Well, this year I've decided I really want to figure this candy thing out and I read somewhere that you should calibrate your thermometer if you're having problems. I put it in a pot of boiling water which is around 212 Deg F (just a little lower with our altitude) and this thermometer read 187 Deg F which is WAY off. No wonder my candy kept burning or breaking! This is going in the trash and I'm getting a new one that works!"
5,Yummy Smell,"This product delivers: its smells great, works wonderfully, and leaves your skin very soft. It is so rough to use on the face, but the seller warned about that and it is clear once you start using it. I would order this product again without hesitation."
2,Worked great until I had to buy a new one,"This was a great deal, and it worked so well. Then two months later (after only using it maybe six times) it just stopped working. The mercury turned an odd peach color and I couldn't read it anymore. I bought a new one of the same kind, it has been working well. Hope it lasts."
5,Candy Thermometer,Excellent thermometer. Best I have ever used. Very easy to use and read. Very durable.
1,loose bulb and numbers wash off,"In less than 6 months and maximum 6 uses the lower printed temperatures are washed off (from a sponge no less) and now the glass bulb is loose making it useless (if the glass moves that changes the temperature shown). Not worth $12, and that is saying something!"
1,Not what I ordered,What I ordered was made by Taylor. What you sent me is a cheap generic off brand. I will be returning the item and asking for a refund or the correct item as advertised.
1,Perfect if you like ingesting ink,"You would do well to avoid the poor quality of this thermometer. Had the numbers start to come off after ONE use. The ink is simply disintegrating and will wipe away with the slightest touch. Other than that the quality seems fair. Nice rivets, and the thermometer bulb is well shielded from damage. None of that is worth much in my book though if using the device can lead to illness."
3,Candy Thermometer,Accurate and grips well to side of the pan. Printed temparature markings tend to wash off over time with use.
3,Handy but inaccurate. Compensate for it and you'll be fine.,"My digital thermo reads 212.2 in boiling water. This one reads right around 202-206 in the same water. This discrepancy threw off my first few batches of candy, but after watching the two thermometers work side by side, this analog one appears just under 10 degrees off throughout the entire scale. Now, after compensating for that 10 degree downshift, everything comes out fine."
5,Excellent!,"I just bought this thermometer because I wanted to make some candy for gifts this holiday season. It worked perfectly, has a great detailed display, an adjustable metal bracket for placing on the side of the pan, and seems very sturdy. I look forward to using this for many years to come."
1,Sad but true: the numbers *do* wear off :-(,"These are probably the easiest candy/deep-fry thermometers to find... too bad they don't live up to expectations. The numbers wear off quickly, and you'll get 1-3 uses before you're back to guessing what the temp is. It doesn't seem to matter *how* you wash them, the numbers will fade (if you use the dishwasher), or just wipe off (if you hand wash and dry).I'm still on a search for the ideal candy/deep-fry thermometer; unfortunately this isn't it."
1,Disappointing,I did research and read reviews before ordering this but was so disappointed when I used the thermometer and the numbers rubbed off! Who makes something like this? I couldn't believe my eyes. My old candy thermometer I had for 30 years and never had a problem. I would not recommend this thermometer because what good is it if you can't see the temperature readings!
5,Sandisk Case Good Protection Good Value,"This silicone case fits the player exceptionally well, helping to make the player bounce-proof. It easily slipped over the player. Given the price it is an exceptional value, particularly if it prevents damage to the player in event of an accidental dropping."
1,sansa E200 Series silicone case,"didn't fit my e200, was too small and wasn't worth sending it back. I would make sure with the seller they have the right case listed."
1,Love the Pattern~But Amazon gets a 0 Star!,"This is such a beautiful pattern and the color is so nice. But beware if you get it shipped through Amazon!! I ordered 3 16 pc settings and they all arrived in very small pieces. Amazon shipped it in its retail packaging (No protection at all)Just the cardboard separations Pfz uses. They really needed to put it in a bigger box with protective material all around it. So I got my 3 16 pc replacements and sure enough they were the same way, after I even told them the problem. So anyway great pattern and Dinnerware, Terrible shipper! Beware."
3,Questionable,"The performance of the Dahl concerto hardly compares to those of Hemke, Sinta, Sugawa, or possibly even John Harle. Lulloff's playing is quite out of tune at times, and his altissimo lacks the strength and projection to really soar over the wind ensemble. STITT is confused about what kind of piece it is trying to be...bad classical or bad jazz. The Colgrass has nice moments throughout, but the sound of the solo quartet is inconsistent from player to player, and their concepts of style in this piece--that borrows on many traditions--are marginal. The large ensembles are good, but the recording sounds 'thrown together'. The brass playing in the Dahl is clearly weak at times and possibly not up to the level for a cd release."
4,Death and Return of Superman,"I liked this game because of the story it's based on. The Death and Return of Superman is probably one of the greatest stories ever told by DC Comics. Alongside Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Tales of the Spectre"" I enjoyed the story. Then, they decided to make a video game for it in 1994. The fighting in the game can be very difficult. Especially when you fight Doomsday in the 2nd level. But, you are able to play as the original Superman, Steel, Superboy, the Eradicator, and the Cyborg along different levels. I reccomend this game to rabid S-man fans. 4 out of 5 stars."
2,A book that definitely needs improvement,"While this book does a good job telling you ABOUT clothes, fabrics, care, it does next to nothing when it comes to suggestions on starting a person's wardrobe, a dress scheme or plan, etc. Sure, they dedicate a chapter to those subjects, but they just end up rambling about concepts rather than some concrete suggestions. This book is kind of a dissapointment and not worth a purchase."
1,Whose idea was this?,"I have seldom been so disappointed in a book. Why? Several ""no-brainer"" aspects of the book gone bad. I was looking for a book with lots of basic information re: men's casual clothes/how to judge quality, rules of thumb for care and building a wardrobe, etc. It just wasn't there. I know enough to know I don't know much about clothes and fashion, but in the entire book there was maybe one or two things that were news to me. The rest was obvious stuff. And the no-brainers? How about an entire chapter on all the different kinds of fabrics and their characteristics and no pictures of any of them? Duh! Overall the book feels like it was written over a three-day weekend. Buy something else instead of this dog."
3,Why a pathway to casual clothing!,"I find the book of reasonable interest & logic regarding casual dress. However,we should provide more information on 'WHY' many men & boys prefer the 'casual pathway'in clothing. My book 'Fashion Freedom'explains 'WHY' boys & men should 'go casual' See the editorial note."
3,Wiha quality is not what it used to be,"I was always a big fan of Wiha products. The quality of the product they used to make was a step above what you could find in a hardware store. Unfortunately Wiha quality control has taken a nosedive. I purchased three sets of their hand tools in the last week, and every one arrived with at least one tool with a bent blade. I think I will be buying Wera products from now on."
2,much smaller than expected,Had to return the item because it was much smaller than expect. Make sure you look closely at size before ordering.
4,The Strongest One There Is!,"The epic saga of Marvel Comics' misunderstood monster starts here!In this collection, you'll find the first 6-issue run, followed by some issues of the character's revival in Tales To Astonish - the early stories here are either great or just average, depending on who was available to illustrate in the understaffed Marvel Bullpen of the early '60's.Interestingly enough, it's here that we get to see some of the first Marvel work of Big John Buscema and Gil Kane, who were two of the artists that Stan Lee was able to recruit after Martin Goodman increased the pay rates for artists.All in all, it's a worthy addition to your comics library...so what are you waitin' for?"
3,The Hulk in the alpha stages,"The Incredible Hulk is one of Marvel's best, most fascinating characters, but you wouldn't know it from reading this. This's the Hulk in the alpha stages, he still hasn't evolved into the tragic green monster we know and love today. The Hulk doesn't even refer to himself in the 3rd person perspective until the second half of the book, and even then it's inconsistent. Seeing the evolution of the Hulk as a character is kind of cool, but there're better books out there, as well as essential collections."
2,"""Essential"" stories, flawed format.","The format of the Essential series is softcover, black and white (many times muddy), printed on cheap, pulpy paper. The classic stories in these books deserve better treatment by Marvel. Do yourself a favor and instead buy the Marvel Masterworks series, which are hardbacks, printed in color, on high quality paper. They are worth the difference in price."
5,How can this wanderful book be out of print?!,"I'm so shocked! How can this wanderful book be out of print?! Trial Valley takes up where ""The Lilies Bloom"" ends. Devola and Kiser Pease are married, Mary Call, Romey, and Ima Dean stay in the house that their father died in. There is a lost child in the woods, they all take care of him...Devola and Kiser Pease adopt him. This book is so good. Please, it should be put back in print!"
3,Overpriced,"Written by an incredible salesman. Great introduction into the industry however does not do a great job of improving ones sales skills. Examples he uses are for outdated hard wired systems that require over 10 hours to install.Within the book, he withholds information and tries to sell reader on additional material.Not worth the high price."
3,Basic Sales but no much more,"I rented this and regret it. This is a good basic sales book with lots of good information for inexperienced sales people. It uses Security Systems sales as the thread on which the sales advice is hung.If your are looking for a book that will help understand the complexity of selling security systems to businesses as I was, this is not the book for you.If you want a good basic text, this one will do fine."
2,One size fits all?,"I've used this grip for years, and I like the product. However, my new car had a larger steering wheel. The standard size cover didn't completely enclose the wheel. The wheel was exposed by a gap of 3/8 of a inch or so, so I ordered the superwide. I paid a couple of dollars more, but that gap is still there, and it is just as big as before. Is there really another size, or is that just on the box? It's inexpensive, so there's no use making a big deal over it. Just a couple of dollars more, but they should deliver what they say."
2,Old one was much much better,"I chose Superwide Sport Grip (by seller's picture and description). I received package( different from picture) where was written size ""C"" . Is it same product or not ? DO NOT KNOW. With size ""C"" I still have gap 1/4"" jn Ford Ranger 2011. Not so wide. Old one (Sport grip) was softer, wider , used different method for overlapping (through holes at the end) and covered much much better.Will not buy from Internet with shipping cost. Not bad product. Next time probably will buy in auto store."
5,Best Camp Kitchen for the money,"We compared all of the kitchens that we could find.Feature for feature this one has the most things you will actually use.It is really sturdy and easy to set up. Compared to the overpriced Coleman kitchen, it is much sturdier and more stable.Free shipping will make a huge difference on this item."
3,Whats up with all the hate on UB40???,"Man, JBB can only hope to be as prolific and successful as the UB's. Yes, UB40 has done alot of covers (Labor of Love projects etc) but they have done MANY MANY MORE great original reggae songs. I have seen BOTH Ub40 and JBB in concert. ANd while JBB was good, they pale in comparison to UB40's performance. Don't get me wrong, I love JBB but to cut down UB40 is just not right - they are, next to Bob Marley, the most recognized and successful reggae band ever. Check out their new album, WHO YOU FIGHTING FOR, released JUNE 2005."
2,I guess I'm not as big a fan as I thought,I hadn't purchased the 'pressure points' cd or heard any songs so naturally I couldn't judge it. I came to the online reviews to get some info on a band that I enjoy. Of course I was delighted to see all the favorable statements made and felt it was time to check it out. Maybe I'm stuck on what they've done previously but this one doesn't do it for me folks. Some refer to this as progressive but I view it as commercial crap. Reggae is suppose to be reggae not Crystal Light pop. There was a review where JBB was called the best band out(matter of opinion). I do think they're very talented. More talented than this cd suggests! Maybe next time JBB. Until then I'll be listening to Groundation.
3,A little disappointed,Dont get me wrong this is still a good album but compared to their older stuff this is crap. I dont like this new dancehall style of some of the songs. This album isnt very roots reggae execpt for a few still good songs that remind me of older JBB also i dont like Elliot Martins voice nearly as much as Kevin Kinsella. Kinsella also writes much better songs
5,Best JBB yet,"Blazing Love, What We Gonna Do, Heart and Soul....these are some of the best songs JBB have ever put out. Pressure Points marks a continued evolutiuon for the crew from Upstate NY, and while some of the songs do not work for me (like Resonate and Shadow), many more do. I think this album is missing Dubs though, so I hope they put out a full Dub version!"
4,safety wire,I searched the web for stainless steel safety wire and it was hard to find. Imagine my surprise when it showed up on Amazon. This product is the real thing - genuine racing/aviation stuff.
1,Did not last,"The air pump seem to work despite it cheap appearance; I found the ball to be fun to use, but the ball does not support much weight. As long as you dont put too much weight on it, it may work fine. I tended to sit on it and lightly bounce up and down while watching TV or working on my computer. While doing this, it appears I put too much weight on it, the plastic stretched and my ball developed a puncture. The ball did not burst; but it did deflate rapidly. I would suggest you consider other resistance balls. One that state how much weight they support. Be aware that if you bounce on it that this effectively put more force on the ball and that the ball need to support several times you static weight."
5,Love it!,"I've always wanted this poster to be a fixture in my living room. Now I have it. And it was everything I thought it would be.It has made my marriage better, got me a raise at work, I dropped 4 suit sizes, and it even cured my athlete's foot!In all seriousness, the poster is great. I was afraid of having a washed out image and the contrast is just right on this one.Another good buy. Thanks, Amazon."
3,Super Cheap--get what you pay for.,"I only literally paid $.01 for this 24X36 poster, and $3.99 for shipping...so I didn't expect much. It cam in a poster plastic wrap shaped in a tube...but for some reason, the poster had a severe wrinkle/crinkle in the center of the photo. I had no time to purchase another one, so I put it in a frame anyway for my husband's anniversary gift. I told him about the wrinkle, and he said if I hadn't pointed it out, he never would have noticed because it went almost exactly across the beam in the photo. So, it worked, but I would've gladly paid more to not have a wrinkle...but it was the only one I could find."
4,The Classic Timer,"It's like the timer my practical grandma used. Easy to read and easy to use, with a loud bell. To fully activate the ringer you need to rotate the dial the full hour, then turn it back to the amount ot time you want to measure. When the bell goes off you'll hear it for about 7 seconds.And it's not just for the chef. I use it to focus on many household tasks such as fifteen minute decluttering sessions or keeping my phone calls to ten minutes. Additionally it's a great motivational tool to help keep the kids on track with their chores in a game of beat the clock."
3,Low Cost Mechanical Wind-Up Timer,This is just a simple wind-up timer. It has a short ring of about one or two seconds. It rings when the timer has one minute to go. To set it for less than 15 minutes you have to set it for 15 minutes and then wind it back to the time that you want.
1,It might make you feel good about saving the planet ...,"... but don't expect it to do anything for your clogs. Two treatments, no improvement in drain. The drain is not plugged, just slow. This product has done nothing to improve the situation, even if you wait 27 hours for it to work. Save your money, especially since the shipping also takes two weeks and costs more than the product."
2,Good for one use!!!,I bought a Taylor just like this but is was a square oval shape but same design. It worked fine the first time but quickly the face would darken and then get smoked...cleaning only removed the letter...light cleaning just so I could read. One time it got to hot and never came down on to the scale again. This was in an oven so it had to be less than 550 or so.Find something else...
1,Does not work,"This game does not work. Very disappointed because the ad said it had been tested and it worked but upon arrival, it won't play. Good thing it was inexpensive."
2,amber's online review,"This book was okay. I think that the author spent to much time describing the surrounding and the situation in the beginning of the book. i liked the way she handeled all the situations, especially when they went down the waterfall . she was very resourceful and was prepared to handle anything and everything that came her way. I liked the way that the author used reality in this story to describe the trip and all of the trials and tribulations that she and her family stumbled upon. The author had a wonderful way of connecting to his readers, it was able to pluck a heartstring, she handled many situations that I could not even imagine with a certain degree of grace and poise. I thought that it was interesting that this novel was based on a true story, and that tis really happened to people. All I can say is WOW!!!"
3,action packed suspence,Tim and Lizzy(stepbrother and sister)go on a camping trip and end up getting lost in the woods in the middle of winter. they eat what they can find and barely survive.
3,Excellent Book,"This thrilling and meaningful book written by William Judson shows the power of nature and of family devotion. Although the book gets extremely wordy at times, your mind and emotions get totally involved. Elizabeth Allison and her stepbrother tell a story about their adventerous trips hiking with their father. One specific story is told throughout the book, the story of when they were hiking through winter. Though times got extremely though and unfortunate, Liz and Tim lived through it all. The winter gets rough and nature takes it's course, but with the help of each other, miraculous things happen. The book is an excellent selectiion. It opens your eyes to events that could actually happen and gives courage to thouse who do not believe."
4,Informative and Practical,One of the best book on this topic. Very helpful. A must read for people interested in this subject.
2,A real Keeper,"I have had this book over a year and go back and back for more clarification and validation. I would sincerely like to somehow thank the author for this insight. It has helped me to walk in the light again. I have much more to learn and skill to aquire in getting untangled, but it is getting easier each day. It is truly a day to day struggle,too! My particular subject is excessive compulsive AND narcissistic. Sigh. I had no clue, just thought if I carried the ball longer and tried harder that it would come together; with such a perfect leader, how could you lose? Now I just hold up my ""cross of knowledge"" and hiss ""back off, sucker"" The sun is rising."
3,Haven't read the complete book yet,This book seems to be pretty helpful. I have been going through a terrible divorce and find that parts have hit on my feelings.
2,Annoying writing style,"While this book has some good information in it, I found the writing style extremely annoying: overly simplistic and chatty. It just doesn't fit the subject matter. The examples given are fictious and soap-opera-ish. It just felt like he was talking down to his readers- another reviewer used the word, condescending- and I concur. It is a shame because the subject matter could be very helpful in one's interpersonal dealings."
4,Emotional Vampires-,"This book is on target and insightful. It offers practical solutions and pinpoints the motives of difficult people. It can also expose our own motives. (if we don't have a glass ego) The reason I did not give five stars is that the reading gets bogged down in the overuse of ""vampire"" descriptions."
3,"How many times can an author write the word ""vampire""","I know that Dr. Bernstein is trying to communicate an idea but his constant use of the word ""vampire"" really put me off. Pg 65 - 5 times; pg 188 - 6 times... you get the idea. The information he conveys is interesting if you have never read about Personality Disorders like anti-social, histrionic, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive and paranoid. Buy the book at a used price and you'll get your money's worth."
4,wish it wasn't focused on work environments,"Overall, the information about these types of people is great. But the book focuses almost entirely on encountering these types in the work place, not in personal life. I deal with a histrionic cousin, who maintains her blond hair and Jaguar, while crying to me that she doesn't have enough money for food or medicine. Her non-stop need for me to take care of her has drained me. While I was able to get a lot of understanding from the chapter on histrionic vampires, I had to take the workplace solutions offered and try to tailor them to personal life. I would have liked the book better if it dealt with both personal and professional types and offered solutions for both.And I do agree with the others that he does take the vampire analogy too far. It seems to me he almost felt obligated to talk about vampires when it wasn't appropriate to do so."
3,"What if you just want to learn how to deal with these people, instead of analyzing their ""issues""?","If so, I strongly recommend Wayne Dyer's classic: PULLING YOUR OWN STRINGS. It gives immediate solutions to the scenarios created by all of the major ""vampire"" personality types -- without a discourse into why they're the way they are. Dyer's book gets straight to the point!Pulling Your Own Strings: Dynamic Techniques for Dealing with Other People and Living Your Life as You Choose"
5,"A Field Guide? Oh, yes!","This book is a treasure-trove of useful information in how to deal with predatory personalities in your life. Psychologists and psychiatrists can debate all they want about why people have such disorders but, for me, the important thing, the thing that mattered the most, was learning the art of how to navigate/communicate/negotiate with my particular Count. It's clearly written and you don't need a degree in psychology to understand it. It's also funny -laugh out loud funny- which I didn't expect, but greatly appreciated. I highly recommend this book."
5,"The Lightbulb went ""DING!""","If I hadn't read this book at the precise moment that I did, I would have quit my job. My boss is THAT obnoxious. The most important thing that helped me transcend my constant annoyance is this: you will NEVER NEVER NEVER be able to change these vampires or make them understand why they are wrong. Or that they are wrong at all, or at fault for anything. This book gives you tips on how to get around people's personality disorders and even work them to your advantage. And the best part is, you'll get out alive!"
3,Okay----but!,"This is an adequate attempt to treat a difficult subject with a humorous twist. The problem is that readers who are seeking a book like this are in need of real help in dealing with a difficult person in their life and this book describes difficult people and provides a one solution fits all. People, unfortunately, do not fit into nicely defined categories and often display observable behavioral traits that cross the boundaries between categories making the offered solutions in how to deal with them not very functional.It may be a good tool for someone who has had no previous introduction to the literature on sociopathic or dysfunctional personalities but even then caution should be applied when pidgeonholing personalities. One size does not fit all."
4,Eerily accurate,"The tone is tongue-in-cheek, but the criteria the author lays out surprisingly spot on! For anyone who's been emotionally drained (as I've been for the past few years), you'll recognize the diagnosis immediately. What I like about the book is the author's pro-active stand in offering solutions to present problems, rather than pleading with us (as most self-help books tend to do) to empathise with the aforesaid vampire's emotional problems. Understanding their problems is one thing, allowing yourself to be trapped by those very problems is another. Worth the investment, if only to know that you're not mean or mad by wanting to get rid of these (apparently) sweet and loving creatures."
2,no Borderlines???,"A good enough book, but any discussion about emotional vampires that does not talk about Borderline Personality Disorder is incomplete in my opinion."
5,Very helpful,This book is an affirmation of what we sometimes summarize in our minds about certain difficult people in our lives. Many times you know you are right but just cannot put a word on that feeling. Reading this book was just a big relief for me. If you are dealing with a difficult person who is emotionally draining you dry please read this book. You might be able to fit the character of the vampire who is is ruining your life into one of the 5 categories mentioned in this book and get some emotional validation for what you are going through.
4,Great read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. There are serious vampires out there. However i didn't think it gave practical ways to deal with them, even though there are chapters on it. In the end it is best to just stay away from these vultures. I wish there was a way to let others know about these sorts of people so that they can stay away from there. Unfortunately we live and learn. I had a hard time dealing with someone and turns out he is a vampire and all the other stuff."
5,Bernstein is better.,This book shows how to deal with every Jerk out there without becoming one yourself.
4,"Good Book,..Worth the $$$...","This book was a good read,...I also would like to suggest reading the one by Martha Stout,..The Sociopath Next Door,..also,...VERY GOOD BOOK,...one that I have even re-read some parts of it,..lol,.."
4,Not a funny subject,"Unless you've been involved with a malignant narcissist, you might not fully appreciate the term ""Emotional Vampire."" It is the most appropriate description I have seen so far. Albert Bernstein explains the various disorders that fit so nicely under the title but narcissism is the number one in my book. My favorite line in the book and the one that rings so true in my own life is ""Have you ever noticed that people with big egos tend to be small everywhere else?""The only way they can live up to their own self described greatness is to suck the very life out of you. They feed off people, just like the legendary vampire but this is no fantasy. They are real and the best way to protect yourself is to be armed with knowledge. Bernstein has written a decent portrayal and you will have valuable information at your fingertips. What I don't like is the humorous slant the book gives. There isn't anything funny about narcissists or other emotional vampires."
2,What baggage?,"I had high hopes for this book. But it left me wanting more and not in a good way...Before I read this book I was trying to figure out how to deal with someone that was all over the map. I needed to give this person one more chance, I needed one more way to try and make this relationship work...The book told me what I had...not how to work with...in essence i know what type of vampire i have...not how to deal."
3,Basic primer mostly about male/female realtionships.,"I was looking for something into a more in depth look at the vampires, and from all relationship angles.Parents,siblings, and friends and co workers. This book is very basic and a great primer, but I already knewalmost everything it had to say from just reading internet articles and posts. So only 3 stars.It will be a 5 star book for the right person, but not for me."
5,AWSOME BOOK: 5stars,"IF you know or EVEN THINK you are living, dealing, or having to interact with anybody who seriously drives you crazy, this book is foryou. It was amazing how the authors discription of (well, in my case; Histronic Personality Disorder)personality traits explainedthe person in question to THEEE TTTTTT!! Gotta hav it!!"
4,Aha! Now you know how to spot an emotional vampire,"If you suspect that the person who is draining you may be a species of emotional vampire, this book of profiles may be helpful. It's an easy read, but surprisingly on point."
2,Vaguely interesting... but not worth the read.,"I was drawn in by all the good reviews. So I am adding my review to help correct that problem. It started off OK, but then it just seemed to keep repeating itself. Please read the 1 and 2 star reviews as they are very helpful!"
5,A wealth of information about human behavior!,"This book read like it was telling my story. It is an amazing truism about why people behave in ways that you will not understand until you read it from cover to cover. It explained all the idiosyncracies of why I felt absolutely powerless and emotionally numb about what and who I was dealing with. Also, I would have recognized some of my own behaviors. I definitely would have seen the signs and understood the path in which my relationship was headed down much sooner. A must read for all!"
1,"Miserably written, condescending, trite","Any valuable information contained in this book is completely lost in a muddle of infuriatingly CRAP writing. This editor was asleep at the wheel. I mean, seriously-- WTF? How many times can an author belabor the vampire metaphor? ""... and, just like a vampire, narcissists hypnotize you."" ""...and just like a vampire, they are creatures of darkness."" ""...and just like a vampire, you have to invite them in."" ""... and just like a vampire, they can't see themselves in the mirror."" Oh, for God's sakes! Just like a vampire, this writer can bite me."
2,Useful information but makes light of a very serious issue,This book has very useful information but its overall style is so flippant that it undermines its usefulness. Having been the victim of a character with personality disorders - I am of the view that it should never be joked about. That serves to undermine the very serious nature of personality disorders and their effects on others. It is very difficult for the lay-person to really know what is going on with these characters and the effects of their actions wreak havoc in the lives of normal people and are potentially life-threatening. I don't recommend this book - I think it only serves to make healthy people make room to accept personality disordered people.
4,Works Great.,The cable replaced my missing SVGA monitor cable perfectly. and now everything works fine. I think shipping charges of $8.48 were excessive for this 6 foot cable and I am subtracting one star.
2,Doesn't detect displays properly,"The cable showed up loose in a box from Amazon. I hooked this cable up to an external monitor, and it wouldn't detect the display properly. It caused the display to show up as ""Generic Non-PNP Monitor,"" and I couldn't set the correct resolution. Did the same thing on two different monitors that worked fine (both before and after trying the Cables To Go cable) with a different VGA cable. I'd suggesting finding a better quality cable that would properly detect your monitors/screens and enable your computer to use the correct resolution.Also, does anyone think the other reviews sound fishy and possible sponsored?"
1,I got robbed!!!,"I had placed an order for this item but shortly after i found a similar cable laying around the house. Since i found a cable i decided to cancel the order. I tried to cancel the order but it was denied, despite the item still not processed and in the facility. I had no other choice but to accept the item. So i waited for the item but it never arrived. 1 week later (from the expected arrival) and no item.I got robbed!"
5,Works like it should,"I am relocated in a relative's home for a period of time. I brought my computer gear with me but only one monitor. I scrounged up an old 15"" monitor to use as a second, but could not find the cable. Bought this for a few bucks, Amazon Prime got it to me in a couple of days. Everything is up and running good."
4,SVGA cable,Works well for what it is designed for.It wasn't exactly what I wanted.But that was my fault for ordering the wrong item.
5,great for the price,This product was purchased for a LG monitor I bought on here that only came with a 3 ft cable that was too short. Knowing that before hand due to write ups I was able to purchase this at the same time and it works perfectly. The price is really cheap if compared to a big box store which prices it out a 4x as much.
4,SVGA Cable,"Operates as advertised,seems to be well made, engaging screws are easily accessed and cabling is supple-again Prime saved me gas money and time."
2,A sad tale,Frankly this book obsesses over the sorted financial difficulties which troubled Mr Wrights life and the details of his buying and selling of Japanese Woodblock Prints often at his clients expense. It's a bit of a depressing story. Not much insight into the art form itself. There are however several interesting examples of how Wrights drawings were influenced by Hiroshige prints. Mostly its a sad tale of the desperation of a toxicly inflated ego.
2,water pressure switch with low cutout,"This switch has much more hysteresis (too much variation on cut in and cutout pressures - a bad thing) than the similar Square D switch. I bought it to cut power to sprinkler valves when pressure drops too low, to keep pump from cavitating. It could not be adjusted for a proper low pressure cutout (around 30 psi), with about 40 psi cut-back-in, and stay on at regulated higher pressures (up to about 60 psi). I have since made modifications with springs, weights - you name it, but can't get what I want out of it. I should have spent more money for the Square D, although my experience with them is that work is needed to make the low cutout temporary - when it cuts out, it usually requires a manual reset, which is also not what I want."
2,Forsaking All Others -- Not the Best,"While there was nothing horribly wrong with the plot or characters, I just found it dull. Granted, there isn't alot of room for details in a short story book, so I don't grade it too harshly. The problem was that the characters were your run-of-the mill hero and heroine, their reactions were so very typical. The plot was dull and a bit cheesy, much like the dialogue. It wasn't absoloutly terrible, it's just not really worth reading. You're not really reading anything new, although the author did effectively make Saskia come out annoying. Ah well, I've read better."
3,not as bad as they say,"This game is no Castlevania though, I'll tell you that. It just isn't as fun as those Castlevania games. On a more encouraging note, the game does make me feel uneasy. It's spooky in a strange way. The graphics are another nice touch. Pretty and good-looking graphics, even better than the graphics in the Super NES Castlevania series.The game is too short though. The challenge is about right. Not too hard in the beginning but as you move through each level the hard factor begins to increase. The music, along with the graphics, leaves me feeling uncomfortable because this really is a spooky game. The music in this Super NES Dracula game does sound more frighteningly real than the Super NES Castlevania games.You have plenty of enemies to attack as you move through the levels too, along with some big scary (and sometimes creative) bosses at the end of some stages. Not a bad game at all. It's just too short, but most of the levels at least stay interesting."
4,A Great Teacher from my Hometown,"Ron Carlson teaches mathematics and computers at Plymouth-Canton High School. I've been lucky enough to enjoy his quick wit and sharp mathematical thinking for the past couple years. This book was read as preparation for my math classes next year. It is very well-written, following a favorite teaching style of mine-simplicity and analogy. Mr. Carlson makes math easy enough to understand by connecting it to things that I already can associate. I recommend this book to students and teachers alike, especially in the Plymouth-Canton community."
1,Watch the Movie don't play the Game,"this game is bad. I wish it wasn't but it is. watch the movie and have a good time, but stay far away from the game. 1 star."
4,this was a cool game.,this was a pretty fun game. it wasn't to hard like some others i played like it. it's sort of based on the movie. they aded some extra stuff but thats okay it just makes the game more fun.If you liked this game see the movie play the Gameboy version.
5,Tha Great,"this is a banga ass cd to bad sum of the songs are like really bad but that mike watts makes up fo that with the screwin and choppin, go get it great cd ."
4,Throwed!!,"I just wanted to say that this cd is hott and also point something out to the guy that said ""the music sounds like it is running on slow mode"" on the review. well off course it sounds slow it's screwed and chopped stupid.. screwed is also known asslowed. Anyway get this cd if you're into screwed rap."
1,This CD is Screwed & Chopped!,"My first thought is that the original album was pretty good so my attitude towards this remix was optimistic; when you're used to some decent mixing you can tolerate almost anything. I listen to and purchase a lot of mixed albums but this is by far the worst mix I have ever heard- from the first title to the last, the music sounds like it is running on slow mode, it took me a few minutes to realize that this was actually the mix rather than a bad dup of the CD. I would recommend no one purchase this CD; you may get more enjoyment on the latest release of Barney (yeah the purple dinosaur). I will agree that the original was good but this ""Screwed & Chopped"" mix is a disaster!"
2,"An unusual selection, but very poor sound quality.","This CD features recordings from two live shows at Club Zanzibar, recorded just a few days apart. Liner notes list the performers but not the composers of the pieces. The sound quality of these recordings is so poor that the CD is irritating to listen to. However, we do get to hear some pieces that are hard to find elsewhere, such as Zanzi, Gypsy Sweetheart and other instrumentals. We the Cats Shall Hep You is also hard to find on CD, and it is prime Calloway."
1,Lacie 1TB USB Hard Drive,"Hard drives either work, or they don't. This worked for about a week and a half until it failed and had to go back to the manufacturer. I am guessing that the controller failed and that the disc itself is OK. At least customer service accepted the return for repair readily, although the service telephone number that they provided wasn't working and I had to use another number to get through. I have used a bunch of other USB drives and they have all held up for years. I had read about reliability problems with these and had hoped that I would be luckier. Ah well."
2,"OK for redundant back-up, NOT as a work drive","I have repeatedly been warned that LaCie drives have chronic problems with overheating, and my own experience supports this. I lost about 300 Gb of photographic and video material when a LaCie drive failed on me.If you do video or photography, the drive will heat up since it will be accessed constantly by the computer. A drive should have more than just a heat sink -- noisy though it might be, a fan can save your drive. Or the must have a very good heat sink. LaCie doesn't not seem to measure up on this count.I would be particularly wary of a large drive in a compact enclosure. Where is the heat going?I have had good experiene with G-Technology drives (G-Raid, G-Drive Q, etc.). They are more expensive."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DRIVE,"The drive does not mount on Mac OS 10.4.9. It mounts sometimes on 10.4.8.I'm a big fan of LaCie, BUT NOT THIS DRIVE!!I'm going to try and return this Big Disk USB 2.0 for the Big Disk Triple Interface version."
1,You will spend a lot of time debugging the authors examples,"I would normally expect a book with the title ""...in 24 hours"" to be an introduction to a subject and would expect clear simple examples. You won't get that here. Most of the book is about how to use VBScript to write ASP code. Unfortunalety there is an error in the authors code for about every 5 lines. So if you plan to learn VBScript be prepared to use 48 hours for debugging the authors examples in addition to the 24 hours. If you know VBScript...well then I guess there is not much to learn from the book."
5,If you want to start with ASP... this is the book,This is a great book for everyone who wants to learn the basics of ASP and begin writing code. There are great commented examples codes. It would be good if all other books could do the same and explain all code they show us. It's better if you read also a Visual Interdev book. Congratulations to the author.
