5,Does what it's supposed to do!,"You don't have to think twice, the price is the best and this cable will exceed your expectations, a good product for the price."
1,doesnt work,this product took 2 weeks about to come in and it doesnt work and ik its not my tv because i tryd like 3 or 4 other peoples hdmi cables and they work fine this one doesnt
1,Couldn't Connect Macbook to TV,"Tried to use it with a Moshi Minidisplay port to HDMI adapter, in order to connect my Macbook to my Sony TV, with sound. It did not work at all, and at first I thought it was the adapter, but the adapter worked with a different cable. So yeah, it just didn't do it for me."
5,Good product - excellent price,"Everybody who ""believes"" that a $150 HDMI cable is notably improving the HD experience vs. a cheap cable should stay away from this product. All the other, more realistic people should buy this cable (buy two or three more - the next $3K HDTV might come again without a cable) and save some money."
1,Never got it...,"Ordered this a month ago, have yet to see it. Avoid this vendor like someone who has recently been to Mexico with a bad cough."
5,HDMI cables for PS3,"no need to pay extra high $$ for the same material. believe all the hype that tells you the cheap cables are just as effective as the expensive ones. these cost me $5 total, and i plugged them into my ps3. they work without problem or issue. games and blue-ray look great.IN CASE YOU MISSED MY POINT, DON'T BUY EXPENSIVE HDMI CABLES!!!"
5,Awesome Price and Speedy Delivery!,"I was shocked at the price. It was sooooo low. And it got here very quickly! Plus, IT WORKS!!! Connected my cable box to my new LED tv."
5,Super - service and product,"Great delivery time, quality and price of product. Will do business again when I need any cable.WR"
3,Um.....,"I'm not quite sure that I can tell a difference with the HDMI cable than without the HDMI cable. I am glad that I didn't pay big bucks for one only to have the same problem. Sometime I think it looks more HD, but my husband can't ever see it."
5,Excellent quality cables,"I want to thank this company and the others like it for selling cables at an honest price. I find it sad that so many consumers pay upwards of $50 for HDMI cables at the brick and mortar stores. Since HDMI is digital, the signal is either on or off. That being said, even cheap HDMI cables will carry a perfect signal (up to approx. 35 feet).Still, I was worried about the quality of these cables. However, when they arrived, I was very pleased. They were in perfect condition and of high quality. I couldn't be more pleased."
1,Hated it!,"Yeah, it's cheap. So i thought: it's only $3 so i'll give it a try. Well, I got taken. I connected it, and got an average picture but no sound. So I disconnected it, rerouted the cable and reconnected. This time i got a snowy picture, with sound. So, after reading the troubleshooting guide, i went to Best Buy and bought a $30 cable. It worked perfecto. If it's too good to be true, it really isn't worth it. This product should not even be sold by Amazon. It isn't suitable for the average person to use in normal home usage."
4,"Good HDMI Cable for Your TV, Not PS3","As a first time buyer of HDMI cables, I thought it would work the same as a USB cable would - universal, with no compatibility issues at all. I purchased this for my PS3, but when I hooked it up, it did not work at all. So I tried switching it with the HDMI cable for my DVR, only then did it work. I've tried switching the cables back and forth and found that that was the best setting for everything. So, I ended up using this HDMI cable for my TV, and my old cable for the PS3. Quality's good for the price. It even comes with those little plastic covers for the cable, which I found nice. Would have been better if it was stated here that it's not compatible for the PS3. Other than that, I haven't had any troubles with it. Just like everyone says, it works as well as the $30 cables. I'd recommend this product. Just remember, TV, not PS3."
3,Its ok,Arrived in a reasonable amount of time works good with HD-DVDs but doesn't hook up to cable box.
1,"Good price & delivery, but it doesn't work",This cable is apparently unable to deliver a video signal (of any kind) between a Toshiba upconverting DVD player and HDTV.
1,my cable never arrived. waited 17 days,"my 1.99 HDMI cable never arrived, couldnt track it (not available) and I waited 17 days. other retailers ship with in a day or two. had to cancel order eventually"
2,Ordered Two HDMI Cables: One Devective...Other Good.,"I ordered two cables as part of the same order. When they arrived, one was clarly defective not allowing a connectio; the other cable was defective. As soon as I called Amazon I was walked through the process of returning a defective item. I submitted the proper forms and quicly received a replacement device. I am now satisifed."
4,Works,The cable is much thinner than any HDMI I've seen in the past but it works and that's all it's supposed to do....
1,It is Worst,"The cable didn't work at all,i have tried connecting to my Monitor,and tried to connect through TV..it didn't work at all and got an message that the cable is not supportive for HDMI.(Please check the cable)."
2,Doesnt support 1080p 60Hz. SUpports only 1080i.,I bought this cable sometime back. It works but I had no idea what it supports what it doesnt.Recently I bought a PS3.I connected using this cable to my 1080p Samsung TV.When I select 1080p as output from PS3 it says doesnt support.If I select 1080i it worked. Even when I played a blue Ray moviefrom my PS3 it worked good. But I had no idea what was wrong when I selected 1080p from Vedio settings in my PS3.The only problem is the TVs that support 1080p always support 1080i alsoand one maynot be able to figureout whether the output is 1080p or not.Even the frequency I guess is a problem with this cable. It doesnt seem to support higher frequencies like 60Hz/120Hz.I suspected the cable might have a problem.Then I bought below cable and it works perfectly good for everything.Mediabridge - 3ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - Blu-Ray - PS3 - W/Nylon Sleeve.
3,"HDMI 2M cables, OK but not like images on web site.","The cables look OK, but they are not gold plated nor do they have the HDMI logo as in the first four images in the Abacus 24-7 advertisement.The cables are actually nickel plated and without the logo, which possibly means that the manufacturer is not HDMI certified nor licensed.If this is the case, Abacus 24-7 should not be posting erroneous and deceaving images.After connecting the cables, the quality of the image is good, but the issue of the plating and the logo makes me wonder if the quality would be better with a truly certified HDMI cable, like those +$100 ones.At the end, I guess I got what I paid for."
5,Super great buy.,"I bought two because the low price led me to believe it wasn't a good product. However, they are great and work flawlessly."
3,What do you expect for $1.99,"Hey, you pay this price for a cable you could spend $100.00 for, so what do you expect? It's 6 feet long (great for me) skinny as that Moss broad and will probably last a couple of years if you don't ever have to touch it again.All in all, ""it's just what I thought it would be""..."
1,It burned our HDMI port in the TV after a year and a half of use,"My son bought this because of the low price, but it burned our HDMI port in the TV after a year and a half of use. Get a better quality cable instead!"
5,hdmi review,Great price for a 1080p hdmi cable. you wont be able to find it any cheaper than this specially at stores.
1,What a waste of Money,"I hooked this HDMI cable up to my LED TV and my ROKU HD player and no matter what channel I watched was complete FUZZ :( I hooked it up to my computer and linked it to my TV and still fuzzy. Its not worth it to mail it back and pay for postage and receive ANOTHER defective one. What a rip off!ON EDIT: The seller (Elmenos) has since provided me with a complete refund. The seller is OK, but hdmi cable was not. I noticed that there are many sellers of this product and that thousands have sold on amazon. It appears there are lots of defective ones in the bunch. So good luck in getting one that works for you. I plan to find a high quality cable and if that means paying more, no problem."
2,Very poor quality,I purchased a 10 foot and a 6 foot cable. This 6 foot cable worked better than the 10 foot cable in that the signal made it to the HDTV but with many dropouts. The picture was definitely usable but using a decent cable made the video excellent. Don't waste your time and money -- just get a better cable the first time.
1,poor quality cable and caused screen flicker and lines,Used these cables to connect my DVR to a Panasonic plasma TV and had flicker and a line that ran up the screen from bottom to top constantly. Tried both cables from this seller with the same problem. Swapped the cable for different HDMI cables that I already had and the issue went away. Poor quality cables.
4,Just Fine,"The HDMI cables work great, I am using them with a Yamaha receiver, a Philips (1080p) TV, and a Playstation 3."
5,Enhancment Tool,"HDMI cables enhance tech, in a word, assist your devices operate faster, and smoother connects reads. controls sound and videos who could ask for more."
2,Worked...for a while,"I bought these cables back in September thinking that it was a great deal. Initially, I had no complaints - I connected an hdmi from my Sony DVD player to my toshiba TV and it worked great. About 3 months later, however, we started having some problems getting the DVD player to play into the TV. We would unplug the HDMI cable from the DVD player or TV and replug it back in, and it would work again. Minor struggles like that became more and more frequent until most recently when even making minor adjustments did not seem to get the DVD player to work into the TV. We tried a different HDMI cable, one made by amazon, and the DVD player worked. We tried putting this HDMI cable into a different slot in the TV but that didn't work. Overall, I think that this is a good buy for short term but that these do not last long enough to be used on an everyday basis."
2,Didn't work long,We received this HDMI cable very quickly from seller - it worked great for a couple of days and then stopped working correctly. The colors were transmitting incorrectly. I switched with another HDMI cable and the tv worked fine. I notified the seller and they provided a full refund very quickly.
5,"First Class Product, Great Price",These are great. Unbelievable low price for the quality of product. Would definitely order more.
1,Not worth it.,"You get less than what you pay for with this cable. I knew when I bought it not to expect something of high quality, but I've had it for less than a month and it's already stopped working.There were immediate problems with the audio, but they were ignorable. However, after owning and using the cable for only 3 weeks, I plug it in to my computer and the visual component was out, too. All I got was a green screen on my television.This product is crap. Don't waste your time with it."
5,HDMI CABLE UNDER $2,"The cable performs as expected, first.Secondly, I should have purchased at least two cables.Terrific purchase !"
4,No problem so far - NICE,Nice shipping and no problem so far in the quality of the video and audio quality. The quality of the product itself is good. But you got to remember that you will get what you pay for.
5,Best cost-effective HDMI out there!,"I ordered the cable about 5 days ago and it came 2 days ago the reason I didn't write a review immediately was because I've been playing xbox360 with this cable. It works great just as good as the $30 dollar HDMI cables at the store when I plugged it In to my xbox I was amazed by the clarity and quality the HDMI offered when I plugged in to play MW3. I could see people from across the map and my gaming has improved so much games like skyrim appear stunning with this HDMI and for a price of about $5 this is worth it. As I write this I'm ordering 4 more cable to use with my other HDMI compatible devices. All in all I was really immerses by the quality of this HDMI, it blows away all other HDMI's in price. There are some better quality ones out there but this is deffinetly the most cost effective one on amazon.com well ima wrap up this review because I feel like playing COD in HD with my new cable that's how good it is."
5,Just As Good and Still in Use Since 2009,This cable does exactly what the more expensive cables did and have held up for years now. I can tell no difference in the quality of picture and I now have a large plasma screen I use these on. Will not hesitate to purchase more of the same when and if needed. Excellent buy.
3,HDMI cable,I really didn't need this to go with my antenna but I decided to keep it because I do have another use for it.
3,Adequate Cable; Great Value,"I think the title says it all. Notably, mine measured a little short at 5 feet 8 inches. A purist would call that consumer fraud, but I am willing to chalk it up to quality control. Regardless, this gets an HDMI signal from point A to point B; no frills in quality or packaging. Just make sure that point A and point B are slightly less than 6 feet a part. Please do not expect more for this phenomenal price. Overall, this was a worthwhile purchase, and I would do it again if I needed a spare."
5,Great !,The product was exactly what i expected.. It arrived on time as well. I use it everyday and stuff too
4,go for it...,this hdmi cable is really good!!! its very low cost!!! and also works perfect!!! i like it... and i do recommend this cable....!!! so go for it!!!
1,Cheap,I don't know if it's any good or not. I only bought it to use with the WII HDMI Converter I bought at the same time - which is a piece of junk. I am tired of buying crap that was made in Communist Red China.
5,Gets the job done,Don't waste you money on overpriced HDMI cables. These work great! I got these to connect a Roku box to a Samsung TV and have never had any issues. Great value for the price.
5,Life savers....,I bought like 8 of these. Everything needs an HDMI cable nowadays. so it made sense to go big. the length is perfect for most of the electronic systems i use. and the price was unbeatable... most cable sell for retail at like 20 plus bucks each. I think I spent that much if not less for all of them.
5,Great value!!!,It is what it is.. Graeat price for an HDMI cable. Works as intended for a fraction of what others may cost.
1,Not compatable with all computers,"I have no idea if the unit even works because it's not compatible with all computers but the description doesn't state that.Also, you don't need any extra cables as it's included in the package."
5,Excellent,"Can't beat the price. The cable works great, no regrets on saving $50-$60 for a cable that provides the same functionality and quality."
5,Great Cable at a Great Price,"Cable works flawlessly! Don't get caught up in the hype of $100 HDMI cables. The signal is digital, either it gets through or it doesn't (unlike an analog component cable). This cable does the trick. I have a crystal clear picture and I paid less than $7!! I bought mine from Eforcity, and they shipped quickly - I was very happy with their service as well."
2,"One was good, the other was partially defective",One worked fine I think. The other caused a line in the picture quality on the TV. A minor irritation!
5,These cables WORK,"They work perfectly. 1080p, 1.3HDMI, etc. - they work as advertised. I needed 5 cables for my audio setup and that could of cost well over $200 if I went with ""Monster"". I think I paid something like $21 for 5 of these (including shipping)"
1,Horrible,It does not provide a good connection or picture. I should have bought a shorter cable too. 6 feet was very long
2,DVI HDMI cable,Heard this cable would give me better HD... but this particular cable turned out to be unreliable and flaky.Live and Learn
2,Doesn't work with ALL TVs,"This item does not work to connect my Blu Ray player to my Sharp Aquos LED TV... After the initial Blu-Ray player start up image, I got a black screen.... So after a few phone calls to my TV manufacturer, and scheduling a technician visit, I decided to go to the store and spend a lot more money on a HDMI cable... and guess what, it worked. I now find that should have spent $10 for a good cable, but since I spent $1.73 for this cheap thing, I am out $35 for an overpriced cable at my nearby store.However, this product >does< work with an older LCD HD TV I have, but not my brand new Sharp TV. After reading another review, I'm guessing I need a Category 2 cable.So beware, if your HDMI cable is for a new TV, it may not work."
1,Causes periodic screen flickering on a Samsung LCD HDTV,"I bought this HDMI cable to connect PS3 to a 1080p Samsung LCD HDTV. While the cable seems to do its job of conveying audio/video signal from source to destination at 1080p, I experienced periodic screen flickers on the TV. It got really annoying after a while. After changing to another HDMI cable, the flicker problem went away.The cable does look like it has quality construction and has HDMI 1.3 printed on the cable wall. But don't be fooled by the looks which can be deceiving. From what I experienced, the internal construction of the cable may not be up-to-par, leading to the flicker problem.It did not work for me so it's a total waste of money. At 2 dollars and cents, it is not even worth it. Decide for yourself if it's worth your while."
5,BUY THESE CABLES...STORES ARE INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED!!!,"These HDMI cables are perfectly sufficient for hooking up my Direct TV box to my Panasonic HDTV, as well as hooking up my Macbook Pro to the TV.Do not buy HDMI cables in stores...they are incredible overpriced. These will work just as well!"
2,"OK for Audio, HD video, spend the extra $ somewhere else","When connected directly through my blu-ray and/or my HD ATT U verse cable box, the HD channels, DVDs, and Blu rays, all had little white dots all Panasonic HDTV'S screen. I also tried to use to these HDMIs for surround sound (philips) and it worked fine for that. All in all, this HDMI is good for audio but not at all for HD picture."
5,Super buy,I've paid a fraction of what it normally costs from well known stores. I've compared the quality of this cable against my other HMDI cable (price $65). The quality and image are just the same.
5,WOW,"wow what can i say the best value for the money,cant belive i got two under ten dollars amazone is where i do my shopping for now on, again i say wow. Best Buy can have their fifty dollar cables."
1,Worthless,"Didn't work at all. Tried connecting my Xbox 360 to 4 different HDMI ports across 2 different TV's, none of them worked. Both TV's and the console worked with a previous HDMI cable, so it's without a doubt the cable that's the problem."
4,cheap video,"let me just say that i have four hd tvs in my house. multiple inputs for each tv, so i bought a bunch of these. Although you can feel the quality difference, these cords do the job. The wire is thin compared to my other hdmi cables but for 2 bucks a peice i cant beat it! produced 1080p video and hi def audio without a hitch! the only reason for the 4 stars is one of them came in defective. not worth returning. Just make sure u buy a couple and you will be pleased!pros-does the jobprice!cons-feels VERY cheapaccording to other reviews, defects seem common."
4,"Cheap, and. . well, cheap","Inexpensive HDMI cable. When it works, it works great, but it seems to come loose in from socket quite often. oh well. Did I mention it was cheap?"
5,Unbelievable deal,"After spending a bundle on a new HDTV, HD DVD player, and upgrading my cable and DVR, I was looking for a bargain. I'm no expert on these things, but for the price, I thought I'd gamble...I could always go out and buy the $60 cables if these didn't work. I'm 100% pleased with the performance so far. They work perfectly as far as I can tell, and the picture quality looks fantastic.Do yourself a favor and try them. Why spend top dollar when you can get these for less than $5?? I'm telling everyone."
3,bang for the buck,I am using this cable to connect my 2012 Mac Mini to a Sony Google TV and it works OK most of the time. Sometimes the image flickers. I am not sure if this cable is compliant with HDMI 2.0.
3,it does what its supposed to,good product. arrived on time. works well with connecting my tv to the xfinity box. its a bit too long though.
1,NOT a standard HDMI cable,This is a Type A to Type C cable (regular to mini)--NOT what I needed. BE SURE THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED.
5,It's a solid HDMI cable for $2. You can't go wrong,"OK - I know what you're thinking. I've seen 6' HDMI cables at walmart for nearly $35, this has to be crappy, right?Wrong.HDMI, especially at the 2M or less, is fairly basic. It delivers a signal across a wire. That is about it.Now some people may have issues with switching from analog (RGB/Composite) signals to HDMI with their devices looking dark. I know my HD TV did. But it wasn't the cable, it was a ""feature"" on the TV that I had to turn off.As I expand my HD environment I can assure you that I will be buying this cable again repeatedly. Even if it fails after a year, it's $2. I can afford a few spares and still come out ahead."
2,cheep-o,spend the extra money and invest in better cable. this one did not last very long until it started to go out. i was not happy and do not recomend the product to you or anyboy for that fact.
5,Works well,"I bought this because it was so much cheaper that at Walmart or anywhere else I looked...and it was so inexpensive that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out a lot of money.Well I am pleasantly surprised. I've ordered 3 now...it works on my Roku player, Xbox and laptop. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Hdmi,"Only buy cables from people like this, Radio shack charges three times as as much for same product. Thanks will buy again."
1,Doesn't work on Gateway Notebook to Coby TV,"Given all of the 5 star reviews I thought I'd take a chance on this cable. Unfortunately, I seem to the one of the unlucky ones. I wanted to connect my computer (one year old Gateway Notebook) to my new Coby (made by LG) TV via HDMI instead of using a VGA cable. No dice. Totally non-functional. Oh well, it was only a couple of bucks. I rolled the dice again and bought an HDMI cable off eBay for $1.17 and that one works great (both video and audio)!"
5,WHT CAN YOU EXPECT FOR LESS THAN 3$,ITS A SURPRISE CABLE FOR THE PRICE. ITS WORK WELL SO FAR WE HAVE NOT NOTICE ANY LOSS OF SIGNAL OF BAD PICTURE QUALITY.
3,Ok for the right application,"If you are buying a cable for Blu-ray to HDTV this is not the cable for you. Apparently not a category 2 cable. Great price and will work fairly well from cable box to TV. Customer service is good. I got two cables, tried them picture was horrible. When I contacted customer service they immediately shipped out replacements. New ones still can't handle the Blu-ray to HDTV very well but seem to work well as a basic low end HDMI cable."
5,Great Cable,If you need a HDMI Cable you can't go wrong with this one. Sturdy well made and flexible. Six foot long gives you enough for the average distance you might need. Fast service
5,Very cheap and useful,This product works like charm and on top of that its cheap and very high quality. It helps me to connect my Macbook Pro and Playstation 3 to my 55 inch tv. I use it to watch movies on my tv and to play games on my ps3.
4,They're cheap - you can afford an occassional bad one,"Great product, great price. Bought 3 cables. One has gone bad and had to be replaced but teh other 2 work great. The shipping is more that the cable, so buy a few spares."
5,WORKS GREAT!!!,I bought two of these for less than 2 bucks each and now am about to buy more. They work great and connect at 1080p!! Best bang for your buck for HDMI cables!
4,hdmi cable,ok hdmi cable. work just as good as the one I bought for 30.00 3 years ago when I bought mt tv. Gave 3 to my son and he said worked fine.
5,"Cheap, easy and fun!","What a good HDMI cable. It was cheap, cheap cheap! And it only took minutes to install! I'm coming to (company name) for all my HDMI cable needs!"
3,"Basic HDMI Functionality, Does not support ARC","This cable may be fine for basic HDMI video connectivity. If you need Audio Return Channel (ARC), this cable does not work with that. Some reviewers of this cable say it does, but mine did not work with ARC. Perhaps the supplier of this cable (Made in China) has multiple sources with some supporting ARC and some not.I ended up purchasing theAmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - Braided (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters)which does support HDMI 1.4 and it did work with ARC. I would recommend spending the extra few bucks and getting a cable certified to support the latest HDMI standard."
5,works as described,this item was purchased to connect my laptop to my TV. It worked upon opening and I think was a great value as I've seen similar cables go for 10x the price.
3,It's Ok for a Good Price,"I wrote a product only feedback stating that the cable goes in and out (to fix I just wiggle the cable and viola!).A day later, I received an email from eforcity apologizing for the cable, they refunded my purchase which was great!If you need a cheap cable to run a laptop to a TV or monitor this cable will work for you."
4,HDMI cable,The order was for 1 HDMI cable and 2 connectors (pkg) but what I got was 2 HDMI cables! I didn't need the connectors so I ended up with a spare HDMI cable. No real problem since I got the job of connecting my Blu-ray to my TV with just the cable.
4,Great product for the price.,I bought this product as ESPN was showing the T20 World Cup Cricket only online. I was initially hestitant as the price was much lower than the similar products I had seen in stores. But when I connected my Mac Book Pro to the TV the display was absolutely great. It was like watching any match that would have been broadcast over cable network in HD quality. Absolutely great product.
5,HDMI Cables,I took a chance on these very inexpensive cables and purchased 6 of them for around the house. I must say that these cables are performing very well and are one of the best purchases I've made recently. I'm pretty sure these perform as well as any cable.
5,Tired of paying crazy high prices for Home theater cables,These work as well as the high priced cables.Stores like to 'nick you' on cables that are way overpriced for new products like HD TV.These do the job as well as any costing much much more. Why? The signal is digital! There is no need to spend more.
1,horrible hdmi cable,"After two weeks, the HDMI cable had to be replaced because it was no longer able to transmit signal. Had to buy a new HDMI cable from Radio Shack, and there have been no issues. Maybe it was a faulty cable. I purchased ittem based on review in CNET."
1,"Cheap looking, did not work","This cable is thin, the connection is flimsy and cheap, and to boot, it didn't even work when I got it!"
5,Get it!,"Great buy, I thought i would get what i pay for but it was the exact opposite. Works just fine!"
2,Too Good To Be True,"I am quite new to LCD TVs and I thought HDMI cables were all the same just like Component cables etc. I bought 2 of these cables - one for my up-converting DVD player/recorder as well as my satellite box. The picture quality was markedly degraded using these cables vs. component. I love the HD picture using component cables but don't care for all of the wires so I thought I would get rid of all of the cables plus get a better picture too. Didn't happen. Could it be the TV? (both HDMI plugs), the DVD player and the satellite receiver? or maybe the cables? All 3 work great on component cables. My limited experience shows me that cheap cables don't work well and the expensive ones cost too much to make HDMI a viable option at this time. Just wondering but I read that HDMI cables have 19 pins. Will they work with just a few less and give a degraded picture? At the price I paid one wonders? Repackaged returned items maybe - bent pins or broken wires inside?"
1,CHEAP PRICE IS CHEAP QUALITY!!!,"really !! our fathers say "" much you pay the much u get ! "" i used it for one mounth and then i get cuting in my images in tv and bad quality of vesion..."
1,If you care about video and audio quality don't buy this one,"I tried this cable because of the very low cost. But when I use it, it shows why the low cost, it gives a very poor image (connected to my Oppo 981 player) that I have to trow it away. If you have a good player and TV, do yourself a favor and buy another cable, try""Cables To Go - 40315 - 2M (6.5ft) Velocity HDMI Digital Video Cable (Blue)"" it works very well and cost only $12.00 + shipping."
3,an honest review of pros and cons - please pay attention!,"so i picked up this cable as it was cheap. i hooked it up. looks great. but then my father insisted on getting the monster cable and we hooked that up and that does look even better. the deal is, though, that if you only ever saw the this cable, you probably woudl never notice. only if you compare. why this cable is not as good as the monster one is because that one is much much wider, therefore letting through more information in less time. it's well, a better connection. do you need it? well if yo udont have OCD have picture quality, no you dont need to spend 50 or 70 dollars. this cable will work, as 700+ reviewers attest. but is it as good as monster? not quite."
1,Doesn't work,"I have researched HDMI cables and most people agree that there is no need to buy expensive HDMI cables. Because the digital signal is 1's and 0's, either they work or they do not. Unfortunately this cable did not work.Update, I contacted the seller over a week ago and haven't heard back."
5,Don't both with more expensive alternatives.,"I was a bit skeptical at first whether there would be any defects, but the HDMI cable worked just fine with the dorm lounge television. At the price, it's a great bargain."
5,Quality For Cheap!,"Let me start this off by saying this: If you pay more than $10 for an HDMI cable (ie. a Monster cable or anything else), you my friend are a sap. Just because the 18 year old at Best Buy says you should spend $50 on a cable doesn't mean he has any clue what he's talking about. Don't let him/her oversell you. There is no difference in the quality of picture that this cable can put out compared to any ""high-end"" HDMI cable. I've been using this with for all my HD needs. At 6 feet, it's plenty long enough for your connections, without being unnecessarily long and creating a snake of cords behind your entertainment center. The cord and connections are solidly constructed, so there's no need to fear about it falling apart.If you need an HDMI cable, you'd be a fool to buy something more expensive than this great cable."
5,A great deal!,A great product for a mere fraction of the price and free shipping! Works as good as any of my high end HDMI cables priced at $25 to $60 bucks or more. What I was told I needed to buy by the sales people who sold me my TVs was a crock. This does the job just fine. Do not waste your money on more expensive ones.
5,Amazing value!,"This is a high quality HDMI cable for only $0.15! I was sceptical at first as it seemed to good to be true, but it was for real. An amazing value!"
1,not that good imagine it produced waving,This HDMI produced waving like distortions from my DVD player. I swiped it out for a better one and ruled out the player problems it was the HDMI cable.
1,HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet),"I'm ordered this cable awhile now and still have not received them, i just hope i do and they works like how they should."
1,I WASTED MY MONEY DEFINITELY!!!,"I purchased this HDMI cord for my Sony Bravia 32inch 1080i Tv, and i was totally disappointed. 1. It made my TV show horribly(even in HD) 2. It kept jumping everything i would try and watch something and 3. I could usually watch my TV on 2 different outputs, with the HDMI cord in i could only view it on 1 channel. It was basically a big waste of time. I dont know how there are all these ""Good Reviews"" on here, because i missed how ""GREAT"" this HDMI cord works. Keep your money PLEAASE!"
2,Spend a few extra bucks and get a better cable,"I knew it was too good to be true, but for $5 with shipping, why not try it? Well I had all kinds of video artifacting and degraded sound using this cable. So I shelled out another $10 and purchased one by Cables to GoCables To Go - 40315 - 2M (6.5ft) Velocity HDMI Digital Video Cable (Blue). Now my video artifacting is limited to two or three channels and is intermittent. With the cheapo cable I was having issues with about 50% of the channels. Sure my home wiring probably has a lot to do with it, but unless you have flawless signal strength do yourself a favor and get a decent cable!"
1,this item is junk,"I received this item and got 'No signal'. Wrote review, manufacture said if I would remove negative review they would re-ship product. I removed my review but they failed to respond with reshipment. This cable is junk!"
3,Doesn't work with Anynet from Samsung,"I initially tried to use this cable to connect my Samsung home theater to my Samsung LCD TV, but the TV wouldn't recognize the home theater set as an Anynet device (video was still ok though)... Luckily, I had another HDMI cable for my cable box, so I switched cables.Picture is fine, can't see any difference with the more expensive cable (who's only advantage is that it supports the Anynet functionality)."
5,Great Value!,These cables are just as good as the ones you pay $40-$60 for at Best Buy or Circuit City. Why not save the $35-$55 and use that money on something else? I bought the optical audio cable too. Shipping took about 5-6 days and arrived in perfect condition. 6 ft cables should be good enough for most applications.
3,Decent quality,I read some bad reviews about the quality of the product but this is not that bad. I was able to transfer motion picture from my PC to TV but I am yet to figure out how to transfer audio signal eventhough I was hoping HDMI cable will help me with that but did not.
5,HDMI cables on the cheap!,"Don't waste your time buying over-priced HDMI cables from the big box stores! If you can plan ahead for you purchase just a little, these cables were a definite bargain. Their fit and finish is excellent and the seller was very quick to ship. Save your cash and frustration, get your cables here!"
4,Why pay more for these!,"These work just as expected. I'm sure you lose a little in signal quality, but it's unnoticable to me. The cables are not as thick as other HDMI cables. Way pay a lot more for the extra protection surrounding the cable."
5,Great Performance and Bargain!!,"I bought this cable for my Mom's new iPad2. I was primarily looking for the short length. This is a great bargain with great performance for my needs. It connects, is detected and works great. Now buying one for my iPhone4S."
4,Great bang for the buck,"I bought this to use with my Roku box. This works great, I would highly recommend this to anyone. I don't have the bandwidth to get high def but the image looks better than DVD."
4,HDMI cable,"super low price compared to in stores and other listings on amazon. not sure if the sound problem we are having is because of our laptop or the cable so thats why i gave some 4 stars. but overall, would buy from again."
5,Good product,"HDMI prices are the biggest scam in the A/V industry. Anyone paying more than $5 for a HDMI cable is a chump. That being said, this is a quality constructed cable, and works well with my Blu-Ray player and LG HDTV."
5,Great Price! Great Product!,"I used this to connect my blue ray dvd player to my samsung lcd tv. it works great, and you can't beat the price. some other cords which provided the exact same quality."
5,Outstanding Product!,I once stupidly paid $80 for a Monster HDMI Cable. Save your money and buy this cable. It works just as well as my Monster cable.
4,Low Cost HDMI,Great value for the HDMI cable. Works great. Time will tell on the reliability. Wire size is only 30 AWG. Could be fragile if moved alot.
1,does not fully work,the price was terrific but the function was bad. I know hdmi cables sell from 20 to 100 dollars so when I saw this price wow. however the seller did not say thatthe cable is only good for video not sound. while the picture was good the cable did not conduct audio. I got a 3 dollar cable that as worth 3 dollars
4,service as advertised,Item was Received on time. Product excatly as described. Works great and is of good quality. Two Thumbs upMADD!!
5,Very good,"Looking at HDMI cables locally and many places on the internet,I found most quality cables are priced extremely high. I found these on Amazon and was pleasantly surprised at the low cost. I've used about 4 or 5 of these and they all work very well transferring my HDMI signal. I will buy from Amazon again."
1,You get what you pay for.,So I thought I would save a few bucks getting this cheap HDMI cable. WRONG! After about 1 month my TV began to flicker and lose it's connection to the cable box. These cables are super cheap and perform that way.
1,Worked for almost a whole hour,"With all the good reviews and the low price this purchase was a no brainer but now I'm stuck with 3 of these things. I tried to use these to connect a DVD player to my Vizio and we did watch almost an hour of a movie before the loud shrieking began. The movie sound completely stopped and then there was all this awful noise. I tried the second cable and the same thing. I thought it might be the player so I grabbed some old school red, white and yellow cables and those worked just fine. Not the player, not the tv but the ""too good to be true"" cheap HDMI cable. I have not tried the 3rd one yet but I don't have much hope of it being better."
5,super high quality,"hey, you can go to Best Buy and get this same cable for $39 on sale - you be the judge - NEVER buy cables at big box stores (maybe Walmart) but you can always get the same cables for far less online"
5,"Good Coble, GREAT PRICE",I have purchased almost a dozen of these cables and have not had any problems with them at all. The price comparative to what you will find anywhere else is considerably less. I highly recommend these cable to any and everyone that isn't a video/audiophile.
4,cable watcher,"Got this cable for under $5.00, free shipping, in five days. It works great with my toshiba recorder-player; up-converts to 1080p; nice sharp picture & good sound. My cousin paid $90.00 for a monster cable; he wasted $85.00 for a name. I will certainly deal with this vender again!"
4,Another good review,"Yet another good review for a super cheap, reliable HDMI cable. It works. It is super cheap. Go buy a bunch."
3,Good cables for the price,"Given the price of these cables, you really can't go wrong, but remember that you do get what you pay for. The cable works perfectly fine for an Xbox 360 but when playing HD movies from my Sony Blu-ray player, there are visible bit errors (white speckles) in the picture. As others have mentioned, these are Category 1 cables (which is not surprising given the price) so they may not completely support the high bandwidth requirements of an HD movie. Just keep that in mind when purchasing."
5,gr8,br8 price and is fabulose buy works gr8 and still useing it and love the fact it was so cheap love it
5,Good product for less!!,Overall it's a very good product for cheap. You can spend a lot of money for basically the same quality you get with these cables for low price.
3,what I was looking for,"Was exactly what I needed and you can't beat the price. It arrived a little bit earlier than what was projected but you won't find me complaining about that either. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my experience and will buy from here again."
5,Love getting these cheap!,"HDMI cables are so overpriced in stores! I'm not sure why either, because any cheap HDMI cable is going to work just as well as those expensive ones. Great product for a great price. Buy it!"
5,Great for Xobx 360,This cables is great. It probably does the same jobs as a $30 HDMI cord. great buy and definitely worth the money
2,Get shielded HDMI Cables!,"I used this to connect our Roku to the TV and after a while we noticed that the audio was cutting out. I replaced it with a different, shielded set (Amazon Basics) and the audio issues went away."
1,This product does not work with Laptop to TV conn.,"I tried to connect my Lenovo Y550 laptop to a Haier 32"" television and it did not work (no video, no audio). I gambled on it for $1.79 with no shipping charges. It does not work. Maybe, I bought the wrong cable or the older category type. It was delivered after a week it was purchased on Amazon."
2,Not a CAT2 cable and will distort view for higher pixels,"Nope, no, not. On my sony blu-ray and samsung HDTV, playback looked like DVD but with snow. Ended up paying $10 for a media bridge cable and the problem was solved. I'll keep this for cable for PC to TV use but that's about it."
2,1080p Difficulties,"If you are looking for a cable that can transmit 720p and 1080i signal this is perfect for you. It would work on all my TV sets (Olevia, Toshiba, and Vizio)in 720p. All the TV's would not get a signal at 1080p. If your looking to get 1080p spend a little bit more on a thicker cable."
5,HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet),"Although the item arrived a day late I am quite happy that the cable actually work. I've tested the cable using my SGS2 and a Menotek micro usb to MHL adapter and it works. It has a gold plated ports which was nice and very sturdy too. The wire is a bit ""slim"" compared to others I found. Importantly its pretty cheap about $2 with shipping! Definitely would recommend!"
1,Don't buy,You get what you pay for. This cable would only work in one of two HDMI inputs on my TV even though the other input works fine. I have it plugged into my Xbox and it often results in errors that exit out of whatever I'm watching/playing. Not worth buying
2,Did not work with two of my devices,"I bought these when I purchased my Asus VS248H-P 24-Inch Full-HD LED Monitor monitor as they were a recommended item to buy (thanks amazon)..unfortunately they did not work. I set up my laptop to my monitor and I got a terrible flickering and distortion. Okay, I thought, it's probably my new monitor. So I hooked up my laptop to my Vizio TV and lo and behold it said 'not supported'. I had ordered two cables and both gave me this issue. Thinking my computer may have fried I tried ANOTHER HDMI cable I had ordered through monoprice and ZING, it worked on both devices. I never condone buying expensive HDMI cables (gag Monster), but these are rubbish. They are super thin and flimsy. Save your money and go to monoprice."
2,Great Price and Picture but no sound.....,"Long story short.Flimsy, no audio produced by the cable from my cable box to the tv and yes I set the cable box and tv up correctly. Picture was great but worthless with no sound!"
5,Xbox compatible,"To all of you who are annoyed with Xbox trying to sell you a cord for $100 at best buy, don't buy it there. I bought this cord for a total of $6 after shipping and tax and it works beautifully with my xbox 360. I highly recommend saving the money with this one instead of paying the ridiculous price from microsoft."
2,Got what I paid for.,"I tried to get off cheap with an HDMI cable but I got what I paid for. Picture kept breaking up (I even switched for one cord to the other to make sure I didn't have a bad jack.) pixelated my screen, sound was full of static, even lost picture completely several times."
5,Happy Customer,Good Product. Good Price. Good Performance. Excellent Delivery Time. Unbelievable Low Price and Free Shipping.What more can you say?
5,"HDMI cable - great price, great product","Ordered this for a new HDTV. Was delivered on time, just what I needed, plug and play. The price was superb and the product worked perfectly."
5,Best price on HDMI cable,"I had been searching for two 6' HDMI cables and the price range was from $6.95 to $69.95 each plus shipping. I found these on sale at Amazon.com for $.26 plus $2.98 for the shipping. That's right, 26 cents! I was skeptical about the quality and if they would work at all but the seller had a return guarantee so I decided to try them. I bought 4 as I figured if they did work OK I would have them as I added components to my system. When they arrived (3 days) they worked perfectly. I had borrowed a Monster Cable HDMI cable from a friend and we could see no difference in the picture or audio on my 1080P Toshiba 40"" Regza LCD TV. I then attached the Toshiba Blu-Ray player and the picture is incredible! This is the best deal I have found in a long time. I will buy from this company again without hesitation. Thank you, SF Planet and Amazon.com Please note that these were on sale before Christmas and the price will probably be different than what I had paid for them at the time."
5,Exactly what i needed,My puppy chewed the hdmi cable out my blu-ray player. needed a new one asap. fantastic price for this 2 pair. dont spend $30 wen u can get them for $3. shipping was extremely fast. will def buy from this seller again!
5,Great bang for you buck,"what's more to say than it works awesome for the price, i got it for less than 3 bucks. Can't beat that."
2,Shipping was how much!!!,"While the price was inviting, I paid twice as much for shipping. 2.98 per cable to ship are you kidding me. I was planning on ordering 6 or so for future use, but after I saw $35 in shipping fees I decided not to do that. It is still cheaper than I can buy at my local electronics store but I think their shipping calculations are crazy."
1,It didnt work,"It worked for two days then stopped working randomly , audio doesnt work any more.. k k k k k"
1,"Cheap, waste of money, go to monoprice instead","Bought 2 of these cables for my new Roku2 XS. Neither works. Both introduces tons of green static in the signal.I tried at every resolution, on other devices, and other ports on my TV: still the same problem.Tried the Roku with an hdmi cable from monoprice, worked perfectly everywhere.Don't buy!"
2,Not 6 ft long,"The quality is great for the price, but it is hardly 6 feet long, more like 4. Very disappointed with the length."
1,Maybe I just got a bad wire but...,"I was very excited to purchase this wire at such a low price for my new TV. But unfortunately I only got one use out of it before it stopped working. Thought it might have been the TV at first but I tried my brother's cable in my TV and it worked just fine. (I also tried the broken wire on two other TVs just to be sure...still no luck) I'm not sure if I just got a bad wire or if they're all this bad. But oh well! I guess you get what you pay for, right? But if the same thing happens to you...you can't say you haven't been warned."
1,Your Get What You Pay For!,"These cables are low priced for a reason: they do not work on most applications! They are ""improper format"" for PS3, XBox, HD DVD, Blu-Ray, and most other High Definition applications. They will work fine in low-grade DVD to flat screen applications and they actually prove valuable when you want the convenience of a single-cable setup in a basic setup, but you're better off spending more money on better cables for more serious home theaters. They are compatible w/ DirecTV digital DVR to TV setups if this is what you're looking for. I can't speak for cable, U-Verse or Dish Network. Overall, I'm sorry I bought these."
2,Good quality but ruins Wifi,"This works great if you do not plan on using it with the internet. My whole purpose of owning this cable was to watch streaming tv and movies from my laptop on my flat screen tv. Even though I have a strong wifi signal in my apartment, the wifi will not work as long as I have the cable attached to my laptop, making it useless for streaming.If you have another use for this cable, like connecting your dvd player to your tv, it will work great with a clear picture and good audio."
5,Solid Cables,They did what they were supposed to do. I bought this cable to watch movies from my netbook on my TV. Works Great
4,They work,"Not much else to say. I didn't put 5 stars because it is pretty hard to say ""I love it"" for a $2 set of cables."
5,Hdmi Cable,I love this hdmi especially because of the price. The cable has a very good length and I haven't had any problems with it. Even though because the price is cheap you may think they are cheap wrong. They are very good I have bought three and all of tem work great just like a $10 or more one it does the same function. I will recommend for anybody whose looking for a new hdmi for their videogame system or anything else that supports hdmi.
2,does not work at all but service is good,does not work at all but service is good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good. strange.
5,Excellent service,The items were just as I expected them to be and I received the order in a very timely fashion (within a week!)
3,"No obtuve, exactamente, lo que compre",Yo realice la compra de un cable 'DVI Gear HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet)' y obtuve un 'HDMI Cable With Ethernet Gold Plated L=6ft'. Ni siquiera entiendo porque lo llaman 'Ethernet Gold Plate'.
5,Great price and product,I only spent a few dollar on this cable instead of $20.00. Wow what a saving and thank you to Amazon.
3,product but prime shipping took 7 days,The product functions fine. Reviewing this product is almost like reviewing sea salt. What can i say about a cable that connects a tv with another device.
4,Functional and Inexpensive,"It's a six-foot long HDMI cable for under $2. I picked this one up because it was substantially cheaper than competing products (Amazon was $2, competitor was ~$30). Did I mention it was $2? That's probably less than the coffee, beer, or pack of cigarettes you bought today. If you're gainfully employed, don't sweat the cost; you can afford this fine product. If you can't afford the $2, good luck with the job hunt, being unemployed is ""teh sux.""Pros: It's cheap!Cons: Did not come with beer."
5,great cable!,"Exactly as described. I hooked up my older Toshiba laptop to my LG 42 inch plasma. No issues, great picture quality. Only drawback is there is no sound through the tv (doesn't really affect me as I use external speakers hooked up to my laptop)."
5,great picture,I purchased these due to the cheap price and willing to loose a few bucks. I am glad I did because it is amazing how much definition and clarity it has enhanced my picture. Can not beat the price for what you get.
5,OMG! This deal was really true!,"I honestly had doubts, especially after reading the negative reviews. I ordered 4 for the heck of it... only 6 bucks with shipping, no problem. So I then plugged one into my Xbox 360, the other into my receiver and so far... WOW! The quality of the cables are amazing and heavy-duty. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Sucks,"This product worked for about a good month then it just stopped working, It stopped picking up feed from my tv. So i recommenend do not buy one. My expensive HDMI cable still works fine."
3,Good,Not the highest quality image but gets the job done and you cannot beat this price! Good product would buy another
2,A pair of rabbit ears would be better!!!!!!!,"I bought this trying to avoid shelling out fourty more bucks for HDMI cables. I was happy with it until i plugged it up, the picture quality is horrible. I honestly had better picture through the little 19"" rear projection with a coaxial hook up, than I do this HDMI cable and a 32"" LED t.v. DO NOT buy this. it is a waste of time and four dollars."
4,"Very Cheap, but works great.",Great picture and sound quality on my Sony HDTV. Best bang for your buck. No need to buy expensive cables.
2,"To an average person, there's no difference","I don't know much about cables. For a HDMI cable this cheap, there's got to be something fishy about it, right? I'll let you decide on that. I bought a few HDMI cables from different companies and tested them all out. Frankly, I don't see any difference on my screen and I own a Sony Bravia KDL-46W3000. Pictures look great on all of them and I don't see any difference between a $100 (OVER PRICED) MONSTER cable to this item I bought. As for sound, I don't own a surround system that has a HDMI input, so I can't comment on that. But at least there's sound coming out."
3,Not best quality,I got it fast - but the picture I am receiving is not as good as my sons-who bought the $100 cable the store. It works fine - but for the money (you can't beat the price) its is doing its job.
3,It's a cable!,"Wow, does this baby perrrrform! The best cable on the market for a few bucks. Look at it shine! Whoooeeee! What a cable."
2,"It worked on an older LCD, but not my New Plasma","For some reason, it worked with an older LCD TV I had, but not my new 58inch Samsung plasma that I got."
3,HDMI Cable Tearing,I received this item very quickly from the seller and it is what the picture shows. The only problem I have is that it is a poorly made cable so screen tearing happens quite often when using this with my PS3 no matter what the media is.
1,Faulty Connection,"I guess the old saying is true, "" YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"". All 3 HDMI cables I bought are faulty, they lose the picture and sound connection all the time. I keep having to re-plug them to get them to work for a little while. JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I would put ZERO stars if I could!!!,"In life you always here, ""you get what you pay for"" and in this case, it's so very true. This cable was an absolute piece of junk. I hooked the cable up between and LCD tv and DVD player. The picture flashed on and off on the screen and never stayed on the screen for more than 5 seconds. Thinking it was the DVD player, I switched HDMI cables with a brand-name version and it worked fine. I thought about being able to return the cable, but found out they don't cover shipping charges, which means they truly don't stand behind their products. I flushed money down the toilet, when I should have purchased the brand name cable in the first place. Lesson learned."
1,didnt work,"MY CABLE DID NOT WORK !!! i had sparkles, blue scren, sparkles,,blues screen and no audio.oh well, i guess ya get what you pay for..."
1,Short Life,"I've hooked up my new Philips DVD player to my new Philips HDTV with this cable and everything ran nice and smooth... for exactly 11 days. Today it just died. My DVD player reports no signal and for some reason it makes the TV not responsive to any commands until I turn it off and on again. Really freaked me out until I finally figured out who the culprit is. Sorry, but even though it's cheap, I now realize that I really did get my money's worth on this one."
1,Not Working Cable,"I bought one a week ago, shipping is fast, but it turn out that the cable is not working. I have to return it. I bought another Philips HDMI cable, it works very well."
5,"Quality may be priceless, but this low-priced cable is quality!","This does exactly what it says it will do, and the price point is wonderful! Stop paying for fancy packaging and a brand name - get a cable that does the flippin' job. Get one, heck, get four at this price. Great cable. great service. Amazon and their partners do it again."
5,Why blow your dough on cables?,I bought some super spendy Phillips cords that had the nifty titanium colored cable housings - $39.95 from Fred Meyers while I was waiting for these in the mail. The Phillips worked great however I didn't see any lack of performance when my DVI Gear cables were plugged in. Great buy. Great performance. Got my money back from Fred Meyers...Peace!
4,Quality without 'monster' price,"I have purchased a couple of these cables, and i have not had any problem with them for months, they are an excellent buy and work very well with hd-dvd, upconverting dvd players, and xbox 360 so far. who wants to pay 50$ for a cable that costs 3$?"
1,Cable does not work,"I bought this cable to connect an HDMI monitor to my computer. A higher quality HDMI- DVI cable works just fine with this monitor. When I use this cable the monitor doesn't even detect the cable as plugged in. Very thin cable, hard plastic around the connector, feels very cheap, and of course it was very inexpensive, but it just doesn't work."
3,you get what you pay for,I could not believe how cheap these cable were when I saw them at best buy so I bought two. One of them turned out to be defective other one works fime. so if you buying this cable buy atleast 2. picture quality is fine i dont really have any other brand HDMi cable to compare it to.
1,Defective Product,"I ordered 2 HDMI cables, enticed by the low price. Both failed to work. I had another AmazonBasics cable - it worked fine. The cables, both of them, are defective."
2,Works... Kinda?,"I could not get this cable to work in some of my hdmi ports on my tv, while other cables and devices work fine. I eventually got it to work on a isolated port on the side. I think this is due to the poor shielding in the cable since it would not work tethered near other cables. But it does work, but remember you get what you pay for!"
5,Fantastic,This HDMI wire is really great. I ordered 1 and tried it on the PS3 Call of Duty MW2. it has great quality with a low price.So go for it..!!
4,Unbeatable,"It's hard to imagine going anywhere else for HDMI cables. Why pay those huge inflated prices, even at Walmart. These do the job for pennies!"
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!,as soon as i got the cable i was like yes this is gonna work for my ps3 and after about an hour i saw colored sparkles on my lcd tv in dark areas i looked up research and i came with the conclusion that its the cable its self. i bareley hdmi on my tv so it cnat be that problem or the ps3 this is my first hdmi and i not happy that it didnt work very well
2,"The ""surprise"" cables!","If you buy these cables, most likely, you'll get either a good, or bad, surprise when you hook them up. I bought 2. The first didn't work at all. Tried it on 2 different tvs. No sound or picture on either. Hooked up 2nd cable, which worked ok. So if you decide to buy these, be prepared for a ""surprise."""
4,Works great,I have found that this product works great as I have expected. I recommend this product to anyone that needs one. Thank You.
4,it works,"i bought it because it was cheap. i have no idea how it compares to a more expensive cable. but it works, and now i can use my HDTV in it's full capacity."
4,Why pay more?,"Bought this with my Sony LCD. Figured that it was so cheap that I could throw it away if a ""better"" cable was necessary. After a month I don't know what the more expensive HDMI cables would do."
5,Works just as well as more expensive cables,Bought three of these cables because they were so cheap compared to the cables available in stores. They work perfectly well and I can't imagine spending 5 times more for the same thing.
1,Returned Product,This didn't work. The picture kept going in and out (I tried using multiple player devices and various dvd's and streaming websites). I returned this and picked up a decent cable at the store that works perfectly.
5,Just works.,"Bought this to watch videos from my laptop on my TV, and it does the job. For under $2, there's really not much to lose by trying it out."
5,Don't Let The Price Fool You -- It Works!,"I was very skeptical to see a 6-ft long HDMI cable for such a low price, and against what was probably my better judgment at the time I bought it. I have been very happy with this product - it works just as well as any other HDMI cable that I own or have used, and is one of the best finds I have ever found on Amazon! I am very happy with this cable, and if I ever have a need to buy another 6-ft HDMI cable, I will get another one of these!"
3,Good buy and happy with quality,These cables are just as good as the ones shipped with DirecTV. I don't use BlueRay so I don't see any difference between these cables and the $100 cables.I also use it with XBox 360 and have compared them to the $100 cables without much degradation in picture and sound quality. Save your money unless you have super vision and can spot out every little difference in picture quality.
5,6' HDMI Cable,"Works great. Save me lots of bucks comparing to getting it from a nearby store, unless you need to have it right away."
5,Cheap and works great!,Enough said. Don't waste your money on more expensive HDMI cables. I have two of these cables (Cable box & PS3) and everything looks great!
3,great,Ordered a new TV & Needed these to go with my new purchase. They arrived in a very timely manor.
1,HDMI cable,"The cable that was sent was defective and does not work. With its inexpensive cost, I did not ship it back as the return process was more involved than it is worth. I would not order this same item again, though I have ordered a different brand that works great."
5,HDMI 6' Patch Cable (HDMI-HDMI),"I have purchased Monster HDMI cables and although they look cool, they perform no better or worse than the two HDMI cables I purchased from DVI Gear. I switch between devices connected with Monster and DVI Gear HDMI cable and there is no discernible difference in picture or audio quality between the cables.These cables work flawlessly to provide plasma perfect video and 7.1 surround sound. I will look to DVI Gear for all my future cable requirements."
4,Great bargain,"Although it took a bit longer than expected to receive this, the quality is great. It does exactly what it's supposed to and the picture/audio quality is fantastic. Definitely a bargain for its low price."
1,Never worked,"Too cheap, may be, it is not working at all. Not worth the time for a return. I'm using another HDMI cable instead, and everything is correct."
1,"Probably OK for ""old"" HDMI devices.",Does not allow PS3 any resolution above 480p on a modern Samsung LCD.I wish the product description had been a bit clearer. Overall this item was completely useless for my needs.
4,"Great price, ridiculous s&h charges","Product works as described, fast shipping, great price, but ridiculous s&h charges (separate charge for each cable ordered). All the other Amazon stores are doing the same thing so that's just how it is."
1,Lesson Learned- Bad Quality,"I got this cord to link my laptop to the TV. The lines and distortion on the screen reminded u of an old analog TV that lost its signal. It was only $2 so I had a feeling it would have a little less performance than my expensive one. But this cable seems to not even have the basic components inside that make it an HDMI cord. Oh well its no big deal, was only $2. but seriously just buy the 1 that u know will perform well."
1,It only costs a dollar for a reason,"When I plugged it in and turned on my xbox, my TV didn't get a signal from it at all. After a few restarts it started working. After 5 minutes of using it however, the signal starts to flicker annoyingly on and off. Don't waste the money on this, spend your money on something with quality."
4,Right-sized!,"Right size for wall-mounted TVs. Golden plate, may be used on HD receivers without losses on signal."
4,They work,I bought these and hooked them up and I only had problems with one pair on my roku. It worked fine on everything else. The one I ended up using was one of these three.
3,Inexpensive but of good quality,"Frankly it's difficult to say a heck of a lot about an HDMI cable. I didn't have extremely high expectations to start with, given the price, but I was pleasantly surprised. The connectors seem to be durable and the cable quite flexible. The cables are of the same apparent quality as the ones I purchased previously at a retail store at a MUCH higher price."
3,for 1.80 shipped you cant complain,"for a buck eighty shipped i can't complain. but i can tell when playing games on my ps3, compared to the other hdmi cables i have that were around $30 from bj's, the quality just isn't as quite as good. its good, but i can kinda see the difference. do i still use this cable...yes. would i recommend it to others...yes for the price why not. would i buy it again...yes, im a broke as s college student so it works for me."
2,"Others work fine, these didnt. Dont know why.","I purchased 2 of these. I have HD Cable, XBOX360, and PS3. My other HD cable works on all 3, wanted 2 more so I didnt have to swap cables around. My TV is less than a month old, so I know its not outdated yet. These cables did not work on any device. I even tried them on my older TV with no luck. My old HDMI cable works on either TV and any device I try. Not sure what the issue is.My TV's are both LG 1080p LCD, 32"" and 46"" models. 46"" was purchased new 2/2011.On the plus side, the return and refund process was quick and painless. Notified amazon.com through the 'my account' link. They sent UPS to pick them up the next day. My refund was in my account about 3 days later.For the price, Id say its worth the chance. Seems like they work for a lot of people, but not others. No idea why. For the price though and ease of refund if necessary, might be worth risking it to see if they work for you."
5,HDMI = HDMI,"Wow, how can something this cheap have this many excellent customer reviews? Don't let the blokes at the retail stores (best buy, circuit city, radio shack etc.) fool you, with HDMI a digital signal is a digital signal; the monster cable they try to sell you will give you no better picture quality than this cable. Please, don't spend $35+ on a cable you can get for a couple bucks. I've had mine for about a month now and it works flawlessly."
5,a bona fide no-brainer,"Cheap as dirt, does what it's supposed to (digital connections either work perfectly or don't work at all, there's no in between), and was shipped faster than expected. I just feel bad for all the poor saps that buy into the insanely-priced HDMI cables at brick and mortar stores..."
5,works great!,"Bought this for my PS3 and hooked up to my 32"" Samsung HDTV. Works great graphics are sharp no problems here."
5,Great Deal!!!,"It blows my mind how expensive HDMI cables (or any sort of cables, really) are at any retail store. Amazon has it figured out. I bought two about a year or so ago and they are fabulous. Highly recommended."
5,Hdmi,"Excellent items, and the best it is the price we pay gor them. Thanks Amazon for sharing profits with the customer"
3,"An amazing deal, but felt like I rolled the dice..","I ordered three of these for connecting Apple TV and Panasonic BD35 Blu-Ray to my 1080p Plasma through my receiver.Two worked perfect; the third had a fault where it would lose signal if bent a certain way. Seemed like a break in a wire or two.Luckily, eforcity was quick to ship me a new one, on their dime. The replacement works perfect like the other two.As many sources have stated, there is NO reason to buy expensive retail-store cables. Digital is digital, and the $80 cables fail sometimes, too. All in all, these are the way to go, but make sure you buy from a reputable seller with a good return policy, just in case.I'm 100% satisfied, especially with eforcity, but I can't give 5 stars to a product shipment that had a 33% failure rate. ""Your results may vary!"""
3,Good one. Could be better.,Good price but it sits a little loose on my laptop. Not sure if the problem is in the cable or my laptop.But its still worth buying as a set with the Cheetah wall mount.
5,Work Great,I've had this for over three months now and the cable is still working great if tried other cheap hdmi cables that degrade in quailty as they age but this one is still good
4,Great value for the dollar,"I can't believe the price of this cable compared to others. Haven't done any quality comparison, but it looks and sounds great to me. I'm using it to output my DVD to my receiver/television. It's a bit tight to connect initially, but that's probably good because a snug fit means it won't come loose. Why pay more for a HDMI cable? This one should do the job just fine."
4,A great alternative,A great alternative to the megabucks brands. I hooked it up through my hdmi switcher and it works just great. A great find.
1,terrible,"terrible terrible terrible. My tv runs on an HDMI at 1080p and this cable makes netflix look like its coming through antennae. avoid and do not use, unless for rope."
3,"Worked great, wish I had purchased the longer one",This HDMI cable worked great and was way less expensive than the ones you find at Best Buy / Staples etc. I later bought another longer cable so that I could hook my laptop to the tv while keeping the laptop at arms length.
1,Quality,The cable I got was not gold plated like it said. I plugged it in and a screen came up saying the hd quality could not be met and the sound was muffeled. Not a quality product.
1,1080p @ 120hz not supported,"Got two of these for less than $5 bucks but they will not support 1080p @120hrtz from my PS3 to my Samsung 50' TV (they did support 1080i, and 720p). If you have a high end system and actually care about picture quality, spend a bit more and get some cables that work."
5,works perfectly,nothing much to say... the cable works perfect with my laptop and with every device I have connected to it
1,"Didnt work, no service","""While it worked in the sense of, It was recognized, It would not put out use-able video when i tested the same set up with a working cord. The cord i recieved was deffective, And while i did try to contact the company, Could not figure out how to get a refund ect. Returning it would be pointless as it would cost too much to do as it is so cheap anyways. I wish i could get decent service"""
4,The Best Option,This is CHEAP and it is great! I went to radio shack the other day thinking that I could possibly find a cheap HDMI cable there and buy was I wrong... they were charing $70+ which is completely ridiculous. I have been using the cable I purchased for weeks now and I cannot notice the difference between it an the expensive monster cables that I purchased a while back.
5,Good product,"Bought this HDMI cable (also separately purchased an adapter) to connect my Mac to TV to watch Netflix... picture comes up very clear, not blurry or pixelated. Great price, much cheaper than electronics stores such as Best Buy. Great product, thanks."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I ordered this product, three to be exact, they came very quickly which was great but when I connected my television to my ps3 two of the cables didn't work at all and the third only flickered a picture and cut in and out of the audio. I thought the price was too good to be true and something I couldn't pass up and of course it was and I should've passed on this item, I hope that others will also."
5,Free with My Roku Purchase and Works Great,It is a HDMI Cable seems well put to gether and I Do not notice any issues with my Roku Player. performs the same as the monster cable I bummed untill I Recieved this.
5,HDMI cable is a good value,I received the cable in a very timely manner. It was priced right and it works fine.
5,Just buy it!,"As recommended by CNET.com, these cables were not only the most inexpensive I had ever seen, but the quality is just as good as any you would find in an electronics store for over $100. The only question mark is how long they might last, and for the price, who cares. Several months into the purchase and they still work as good as new. Don't spend the money on expensive cables, just buy these and keep the change in your pocket."
5,HDMI Cable,Great price for a quality cable. Arrived before my HD set so it was ready to go when the set arrived. Excellent product.
3,ordered a 1080p hdmi cable got 1080i,i ordered a 1080p cable got a 1080i...for less than $5 it really doesnt matter still good quality.thumb up
1,Not sound only video- damaged,"I ordered a total of 3 cables and no sound played through either cable, only video. I later confirmed they were damaged since I ran to Walmart and spent over [..]for just two cables. I was warned that Best Buy charges even more for these.Customer service person was actually helpful and remarked that the cables are made in batches therefore a few could be damaged all at once. They gave me a refund with no hassle.I opted not to exchange and just bought locally since I was leery of quality and didn't want to wait another week for shipping.Honestly I ended up paying a lot more elsewhere. I think the quality on these cables is hit or miss. If they work you've saved a lot of money and if they don't you can still return it."
1,"Great fast delivery but Cables did not work for fios on the Sharp Aquos 37"" 42"" or 52""","Great fast delivery. We purchased this cable and it did not work with our TVs: Sharp Aquos 37"" 42"" or 52"" with Fios. They are also short, so make sure they are long enough to reach. But the price was great."
5,What's not to like?,"This is a great little cable. I had missed several episodes of my favorite summer tv show, but found out that I could download the past shows to my laptop. Well, then I had to get them on my big tv somehow, so I sent my husband to Best Buy for a cable to connect the two and whoa! Over $30 for the cheapest cable they had. No way am I going to pay that much money to watch 4 television shows. So I found this cable on Amazon for less than $3 and free shipping! What can you lose? It worked great for what I needed, but might not be so good for fancy connections. Who knows? But I would certainly reccommend it for watching tv shows, home video or pictures."
3,HDMI cable,"I am still not sure about these cables. I have only used one. It doesn't seem very durable, but I have not had any problems. The price was just a few dollars and I didn't feel like paying $20 or $30 dollars for a cable on a tv I hardly use."
5,LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!,"I really love this cable, it allows me to watch my hulu and netflix apps from my phone on my tv. I can also use my phones video chat function and have it displayed on the tv screen, that is great for when my family from out of town wants to talk. The shipment itself went as it should, everything arrived on time and in perfect condition."
1,It didn't work with my Tivo,"I tried two of these cables from my Mitsubishi WD-60638 to my TiVo HD and I got either ""No Signal"" or ""Invalid Format"". I tried it on two of the Mitsubishi's HDMI connectors with the same result.I then got the MediaBridge Ultra Series cable, [...], and it is working just fine."
5,Just..Wow.,"So I needed HDMI cables. I went to Radioshack. 45$ for a ""gold plated"" cable. I log on amazon, 1.70$ for a cable. I use this cable to play Xbox 360. And it works exactly like a 45$ radioRIPOFF cable."
3,Questionable Quality of Cables,"I have ordered from them twice. Once I ordered a 10' cable and this last time a 6' cable.The 10' worked perfectly so no complaints there, however the 6' cable that I purchased most recently has been artifacting a lot making it unusable.In the end you get what you pay for."
4,Good for the price,"This HDMI cable allows me to get a clear picture from my ps3 and my cable box to my hd tv. The only problem is that if this wire touches other wires, it will cause your picture to jump. I position my wire so that it stands alone away from all other wires and don't have a problem. At this price, it's a great deal."
5,HDMI excellence,The Product works great. Picture is clear and for the price it was well worth it. I recomend this to any person who has an xbox or just wants excellent quality tv viewing.
2,"Appeared to work great, but...","Out of the box these (bought 2) worked great - why pay more? But down the road the connection from my receiver to the TV would fail. Fiddling with the cable connection into the TV would fix the issue for a bit. Eventually replaced with a borrowed stouter cable with beefier connector - and issue has been resolved for a while. Replacing both cheapies now, though second cable so far is working."
5,Excellent Cable for Price!,I bought this product after it was recommended on [...] It works great and does what the more expensive cables do and possibly even better. It does not look pretty but it performs very well.
4,Great product at a great price!,Purchased Western Digital 2TB hard drive. The HDMI cable was a suggested purchased. I bought both products. The HDMI cable has performed fantastically and at a great price! Thank you very much.
5,Just got yesterday works good,Just got yesterday works good amazing price ordered 4 items from amazon to be delivered in three shipments. This item arrived first pretty quick for less than $3 shipping included. time will tell if it lasts but that's true of anything will update review if i have problem.
5,HDMI Cable was just what I wanted..............,"Same HDMI Cable that costs $10 to $20 at other places..... Works great ! No problems at all. If you need a cable, this is a great buy."
3,Decent Cable,Its a basic cable made decently. I never actually used it and dont even remeber why I bought this but its sitting in my box of cables waiting for the day i may need it.
4,Good Buy,"It's a great value, and with fast shipping! Even though I found out I didn't need it for my original purposes, I decided to keep it anyways for the future"
5,great!,they just give you a random cable depending on who you order it from so be careful. both cables i have ordered have worked great but one was a little bit better quality. however both work fine. very happy
3,How do I use it?,"I know I will use this cable at some future time, but I have an ""old"" conventional TV which does not accept it. It wasn't expensive, and I know I'll be changing the TV."
3,You get what you pay for,"The product feels flimsy, but still works. Overall, it isn't a bad product. It just looks and feels very cheap, but then again, it costs next to nothing."
4,Great buy,"These cables are great to have for new technology. They work well, and for the price I am very pleased.I gave this a four as I only give fives to products that really wow me."
1,Unreliable,You get what you pay for.. this cheap cable cuts out during use at times. Better to spend a few dollars more on one that actually works reliably. I swapped this one out for a better cable and no longer have issues with my monitor randomly turning off.
4,HDMI Review,Product is exactly as described. Picture cuts out periodically when the signal is first going through it. It works fine after a few minutes however. Not a big deal considering the price. Much rather pay this than retail.
1,unhappy with performance,I ordered sixty of these cables and nearly half of them don't pass video or have a very good signal.Nearly all that we have installed have had to be replaced with different cable made by a different manufacturer.I've requested to return them but have not heard back from the seller.
1,Noisy!,"Worked a couple of times from PC to TV, then started getting noise. A cheap product that didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Elongated blown Picture quality,"I was very excited to get this HDMI cable at a fantastic price...but was thoroughly disappointed the minute I plugged it in..the picture quality is very dull and in comparison to my regular HDMI cables, the picture is elongated and zoomed and blurred. I immediately tested my blu-ray with my other regular HDMI cable and the picture was WOW!...I would say stick to Amazon basics or any decent quality brand and avoid this one."
1,The quality is lower as the price,"This cable didn't offer any deep in the shadow and add contrast in the colors, very poor quality but very ship too."
1,Not What Was Advertised,"What came in the mail was not what was advertised. No gold plating, not 6 feet, and the picture quality was awful. I compared it with another high-end HDMI cable that I already had, and this one was a piece of junk. I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,HDMI but not quality,"The cables are thin, not very sturdy. I have a 10 month old who moves my PS3 around and now the cable seems to only work when in a certain position coming from the connector. Poor quality, but for a cheap cable what to you expect?"
3,loved how inexpensive they were,before buying these hdmi cables i was trying to use a coulpe 15 ft cords and they were just getting in the way. i love the fact that these cords cost me less for 2 than buying 1 at walley world.
1,"Poor quality. Adds ""snow"" to the picture.","The cables are the right price but truly poor quality. For any HD product to the TV, these cables added the white static ""snow"" to the picture. Not recommended. Get something of a heavier grade and with better insulation."
3,Okay,"This product wasn't what I was expecting it to be, but it came in handy when I want to view something from my laptop onto my tv."
5,Great price...great performance,"Most inexpensive HDMI cable on the market. Works great, my HDMI picture improved substantialy."
5,WHAT A DEAL!,"In the world of HDMI and digital cables, it's all or nothing; there is no interference or resonation to impact the signal. That's what companies like Monster Cable thrive on, public ignorance of technology; and why their cables are 500% more expensive than these at $60-$120 a piece. These cables offer excellent signal, with their non-excessive insulation so that the cables aren't so wide that you have a hard time hiding them, and they have a highly-conductive metal receptor; all you need with HDMI cables. For the price, I bought four sets of them and have been nothing but impressed.I ordered a fifth, just in case something happens to the others between the kids and dog..."
5,HDMI Cable,"This is great! I bought this for my new Xbox 360 game console and it works great! Shipping was pretty fast and it works great! The picture and sound quality are wonderful and for only $2.20, it is amazing! Microsoft sells the same thing for about $40... What a rip, Microsoft! Great HDMI Cable"
5,Works great,"Bought this for $2.23 with free shipping - it works great. I remember my first HDMI cable purchase approx four years ago set me back over $80 - I had to have the extra long Monster cable. Well, this $2 cable works just as well."
4,Basic HDMI Cable,No problems with this HDMI cable. Works just fine. Currently using it to connect my blue-ray player to my HD TV.
1,Broke before I could try it,"The seller got this to me very quick and was very professional. The cable, if you couldn't tell by the price, is cheaply made. The metal ends of the cord were flimsy and after I plugged it into my computer and television and turned on the TV, the metal ends had pulled off of the cable."
1,Worked for only a couple of hours,"We cheaped out and ordered this cable to connect our Netgear Neo TV to our television to watch Netflix, etc. while it worked for a couple of shows, we then began to receive a ""no signal"" message on the television."
3,Some issues,"Of course it is hard to say much against cables for this price, but I noticed some glitches when I hooked these up to my bluray and laptop. My projector was having a hard time figuring out the signal source and there were audio problems in all cases. The movie previews were fine but when the feature came on the audio disappeared. I tried a different cable and the trouble disappeared. So I guess these cables can work just fine in a simple setup since most people seem to have no problems with them, but in more complex arrangements, as with a projector, bluray, laptop, tv tuner, vcr all hooked up together, then perhaps the cables need to be of a higher quality."
5,Works just perfect on HDTV.,"Was a little skeptical an HDMI cable under $5 but took the risk since there really was no risk. Got it today and it works great on our HDTV. I can tell the difference for sure from regular setup to the HD with this, So you really cannot go wrong with this cable. Don't waste you $$$ onhigher priced item try this! Using with Dish Network."
1,Didn't Work,"Ordered this HDMI cable for my Roku streaming player. First time I connected the cable the picture had a lot of static. Went back to using the A/V cable that came with the Roku. Tried again later and the HDMI cable didn't work at all. I only paid $1.69, so it wasn't worth returning. Threw it away and bought a new HDMI cable from Best Buy and it works great."
4,Home Theatre connected to HD TV,This cable gave me full control of my home theatre unit without spending a fortune for a hdmi cable.Works good with no problems.
5,Almost Free,I needed a cable to attach AppleTV to my HD-TV. This cable arrived in only two days and cost almost nothing. It works beautifully. I'm so happy I read the reviews ahead of time and didn't opt for the expensive audiophile offerings out there.
1,Bad Product,Earlier i ordered same product around in the end of March...To my surprise the quality of that cable was so good...so i again ordered same product for my friend..and to my surprise this time cable shipped to me was really thin in terms of thickness..also the Video Result was not good..compared to the same cable I purchased earlier...don't understand...what happened???? Same Cable Brand...but different products at two different times...!!!!!!
5,DVI gear HDMI cable,I received my cables earlier than expected and they have worked great so far. I would order this brand of cable again.
5,DVI Gear HDMI Cable,"I wasn't sure what I needed to convert a signal to HD from my old analogue Bose DVD player. My son in law uses Amazon all the time and found this product for me for far less than I ever thought possible. I am very happy, this, along with a converter box, did the trick. Works great."
3,Thought it was great but it broke on me,"For how cheap this HDMI cable was, I was really expecting a poorly made product that would barely work. I was pleasantly surprised. It's well made and it works great. I do wish that the length was a bit longer, but 6ft gets the job done. (I use it to connect my HD TV to my laptop.) It also shipped very quickly. Would definitely recommend buying.Update: I wish I had gotten a longer cable. My pets ran into it, caused the laptop to fall to the floor and then the metal part of the cable became loose. If it had been longer, I don't think this would have been a problem. -2 stars"
4,Received as expected.,Received item as expected.They work and didn't cost an arm and a leg as if I had bought them from Best Buy or Walmart.Digital signal is all or nothing here. So these work great.Second batch of HDMI cables purchased from Amazon.
2,cheap is cheap,"Okay, not too much to say. This thing was like .05 cents so I can't be that mad. The shipping was like $5.00(rip off). It works alright. I just always have to turn my TV off then back on because the audio starts clipping when you switch to the HDMI (I have other HDMI cords and they work flawlessly on this TV), but after that the cord works fine. Let's see how long it last."
1,"Well it looked nice, but it doesn't work.","The cable looked expensive and brand new, but alas it was junk. It worked for about an hour and then cut out. Don't waste your money. The company itself was very quick about shipping it, and I bet they would have sent another if I had complained, but I wasn't going to waste my time over $5."
4,"Very good, if not best, bang for your buck.","Bought a Moster Cable HDMI for ~$100 while waiting for this to arrive. When it was delivered, my wife and I compared the two products.Monster Cable:+ More fancy packaging. =)+ Better picture quality, but it's MARGINAL.- Cost ~$90 more than this product.HDMI cable by DVI:+ Dirt cheap price.- SLIGHTLY lower quality than Monster Cable, but still HD good.- No fancy packaging. =)In short, if you want to pay $90 more for better packaging, which would end up in your trash can, and barely noticeable higher picture quality, buy the Monster Cable version. Otherwise, this product is a very good bang, if not best, for your buck."
5,Go for it!,watching starship troopers on my Philips upconversion! I bought the HDMI cable above and everything is crystal clear! I don't know why the price is so low but i'm so happy i bought it!
1,flicker and weird picture display,"I've never given bad review for electronic products that I bought. But this one is really annoying. I use this cable to connect my sony Laptop with my HDTV. The picture has flickers. What's worse, it cannot display the correct color at all! For example, where there should be a black color, it displays in a dark blue color, which means it has chromatic aberration. I bought a more expensive, quality one. And everything works pretty good."
2,Almost useless,"The cable doesn't work at all with my laptop, while others work. For that I could blame the length of the connector.When I connected it to a Mac mini, it does connect with the monitor (I'm using 1920x1080)- though after a while, glitches appear (a lot of green pixels distributed randomly). Moving the cable solves it, for a while. Same things happen when I connect it to the PC and other monitor."
1,These cables are awful,"Plugged in the cable. Got picture for 1second, then just a blank screen. I bought 4 and none of them work."
1,Disappointed,"I was buoyed by the good reviews here but . . . these just did not work. And I even bought a second pair, in case my first cable was just a fluke. But nope, neither worked well. The first one had display issues and sported an unattractive red streaking across the image and my second pair looked nicer but had the same terrible sound quality as the first (you don't quite notice it until louder noises set in, and then it sounds like a dial-up modem screeching and popping)."
4,"If we are using them, I guess they work","I remember buying this, but I don't know why. I can't say for sure if it's attached ot my tv or not. If we are using them, then they work. I know this isn't helpful, sorry."
2,You get what you pay for,"Just make sure you know what you're buying. if you are looking for a BASIC HDMI cable, this should work fine. If you're using it for high def or internet, stay away. I had all kinds of problems with sound and images cutting out when I had these connected. Thought it was my cable box or receiver. Turned out to just be these cheap cables. You get what you pay for. My advise, spend $10 and get a decent cable."
1,I have yet to receive this item,"I can not rate something that I have not received. Eforcity says they have sent a second cable, but as of this date (4/9/12), I have not received it."
3,Cheap,"This is the cheapest I found this cable. Haven't been able to use it yet, but I'm sure they work just fine."
1,Cable HDMI signal has lots of static,"Based on the reviews, I bought 3 cables and they all bad static that you can see. My connection was from a new Xbox360 to a Panasonic HDTV. I wouldn't buy these again. If you just want to have a connection then sure..but if you care about just decent quality signal...these are not the cables you are looking for."
4,50/50 if you get one that supports ARC,"looking through the reviews i saw conflicting reports on whether or not these hdmi cables support the audio return channel (ARC) feature of newer tv's. the answer is: it does if you're lucky. they seem to ship out two different types of cables. i ordered a bunch, so i got both types.if you get a cable with a plug housing that is kind of fat and has HDMI on one side of it, rejoice! you have received the cable that supports ARC. if you got one with a narrower plug housing and doesn't say hdmi on it, then unfortunately you did not get the cable that supports ARC.to sum it up:-works well-they seem to ship out two different cables, one supports arc, the other doesn't. hope you get lucky if you want that functionality.5 stars if you get the arc capable one, 4 stars if you dont."
1,Not worth two cents.,I bought three of these cables. I used one to connect my Sharp flat-screen TV to our Roku. Seemed okay for about a minute. I was getting a fair amount of flicker on the television. Hooked it up to a different TV and it got worse. Picture would black out for minutes at a time. I hooked up a different (real)HDMI cable and flicker went away completely. Other two are going in the garbage. I am spending a few dollars more for a real product.
5,Awesome,"High quality cable, works just the same as any $60 dollar cable. Don't get gouged buying a marked up cable when you can save yourself the money with this one!"
5,Great Cable,"I bought this cable to hook up my BluRay player. There's not much you can say about a cable, except that it works. It was a great value, and I've had absolutely no problems with it."
3,Didn't need it,"The product is ok. It was in an excellent price, but then I found out that I didnt actually need it. But my neighbor found it pretty useful, so at least its not lying in a corner. It works just fine for a PS3."
5,What are you waiting for ...,"This is an incredible deal. I bought 5 just to have them on hand. Have used a few already and they work like any other cable you buy in the box stores. PS3 on a 52"" Plasma is as sharp as a tack. Just buy them."
1,Bad product. Do not buy!,"There is a reason this cord is so dirt cheap. It DOES work, but when image is projected to the television, there is a distinct cloudyness all around the edges. Better of paying $40 for a cord that performs like it's supposed to. Would not recommend to anyone."
2,OK,"Product was as described but very low cable quality, it works & transmits HD quality video but don't expect the world for $3."
5,Loy,You couldn't bet the price and Best Buy brand was $39.00 & Wat Mart was $34.00. Thats to much for HDMI cable of six feet that done the same job with same quailty.
1,No good..unless you like stars,"Bought this cable to use with the PS3 we got our son for Christmas. It created a twinkling star-like effect all over the tv screen. We initially feared it was a problem with our tv, but found this effect was limited to use with the PS3. We changed the HDMI cable and the problem was gone. I guess the saying holds true...""You get what you pay for."""
3,Turned my plasma TV into a snow globe!,"Worked pretty well, and the price was very nice, but when I hooked the Roku box up to our Samsung plasma TV, we had a pretty snowy picture, particularly when the screen displaying black or dark colors. So, just keep that in mind when you're reading the other 5000 reviews, mostly very positive. We ended up paying just a little more for theAcoustic Research Entertainment Series ES85 HDMI Cable (6 feet)and we're very happy to say our snow globe is a TV again."
1,poor quality,Signal strength inadequate - snowy picture. Not an acceptable quality cable. How do I verify this? By swapping in a known good cable.
5,"You don't need those other brands of cables from ""The Beast.""","This cable carries digital signals, and you are not going to get any difference in quality from a $100 cable. Highly Recommend."
4,Good Cable,"What can be said. A cable is a cable. It either works or it doesn't. This one works, is easy to use, and appears to be of high quality."
4,Worth the money.,"Not the best HDMI on the market, but an awesome deal for the price. Image and sound are much better than I expected. If you're looking for a top quality cable, this isn't it, but if you want something cheap that works, look no further."
5,works just like any other cable.,"I got this cable to complement my 3m Cables Unlimited HDMI cables, which are not very pliable. It works great and is the equal of any cable they try to sell for an order of magnitude more at Best Buy or other b&m stores."
1,Didn't work,"When I unplugged this cable from my HD receiver to my BlueRay player, the plug broke off and got stuck in the receiver. I can't complain too much though, the cable was only three bucks with free shipping. It had a warranty, but meh, I just ended up throwing it away. The signal and sound quality were great before it broke. You get what you pay for I suppose..."
5,Does everything the $50 electronic store HDMI cable does,"It's an HDMI cable. It does everything it's supposed to. It works exactly the same as the $50 department store cable does. I don't know how it can be three bucks, but it is."
2,2/3 ordered are still ok,"So I ordered 3, and two work perfectly fine. One of them, however, causes my cable box to stutter and freeze. Replacing the cable worked out. Strange, because I used the three cables to go ps3-> receiver, cablebox->receiver and receiver->tv. the receiver->tv one repeatably caused issues with freezing/losing sync (screen would go black). annoying!ah, and now it's past the warranty return period too.there's another company that i often buy cables from (name is sort of like ""single cost"") that warrants theirs for life. but i don't have free prime shipping with them, so i didn't buy there. anyhow, that's something to think about. i note that the price for similar cables there is somewhat lower too. next time i'll think twice."
1,You get what you pay for...,Doesn't work at all. Bought this to hook my laptop to my television so I wouldn't have to keep removing my PS3 hdmi cable. Lost 2 bucks. Oh well.
5,A really great deal,"My roommate bought us a new LCD TV, and it didn't have an S-Video port like our ancient TV did. This wouldn't normally be a big deal, but I was using an S-Video cable with my PS3, and I had no way to connect my PS3 to the new TV.The brick-and-mortar stores in town were selling HDMI cables for $30 and up, so I knew I needed to check online. This was so cheap that I decided to give it a shot, and I can tell you that this is an awesome deal. The picture quality is excellent and the cable is thick and sturdy. I've been using this cable and happily gaming in 1080P for weeks now, and for about 1/10th of the price that other stores were asking.What a deal!"
5,Awesome for the price.,"I'm playing the PS3 on 1080i, and this cord makes a huge difference from regular audio/video cable. I haven't noticed any change at all in the audio. The visuals are much better. The cable does what it's supposed to do. Fantastic price!"
1,"Very thin, static issues, cables are terrible",I ordered 4 of these cables and an HDMI switch to manage all of my HDMI devices. Before I connected the switch I tried out these cables on my ps3 and my cable box. Static was terrible - I can't comment on the sound quality because I didn't even get that far. I can only guess that there is more than one gauge this company uses as there are actually positive reviews on Amazon. I tried all 4 cables and had the same issues with each. I'm returning today and will begin my research on some better cables.
2,Doesn't work with Roku box,"I bought this to use with a Roku box. It's much thinner than any other hdmi cable I own. It apparently does not have the power to carry the video signal from the Roku box to the TV. When I switch it with the hdmi cable connecting the cable box to the tv, then both the cable box and the Roku box work -- I'm guessing the cable box sends a stronger signal. Spend a few bucks more, and get a better quality hdmi cable to avoid this problem."
1,You get what you pay for,This item cost next to nothing. The only problem is that it is worth nothing. I just wanted something to easly connect my source to a DVD player. The picture reception was full of streaks. I tried to use as a connection to my cable TV. Same result. Don't waste your time or money buying this product. I just deposited mine in the garbage can.
5,Value,"Excellent value for an HDMI cord, as there are more expensive cables out there, however they perform no better than this one."
4,Good product for the price!,"Not much to say about this item accept, it was a good buy. It was cheap and works well."
4,What's to say?,"I pluged it in to my Roku and tv,and Bam! watching movies and tv shows.I don't think you could tell the difference with a higher priced cable."
5,Very Good value for the price,"wanted an HDMI cable to view movies from the laptop on my plasma tv,works like a charm. delivers what i wanted."
4,normal,"it's a simple hdmi cable, it works fine and it does what it says, 6 ft long and so slim, very nice product, and the cable is wrapped in a bag with caps at the ends."
4,Good Buy,Good buy if you need and HDMI Cable. Turns out we did (when we purchased newer TV and all new gadgets. Checked on others in town and they are a lot more expensive.
1,Didn't work,Bought this to work with a Roku. After trying to set up Roku for quite soon time I realized that the HDMI was defective. I quess sometimes it really not worth buying something just because it had a VERY LOW price
5,Perfect and Cheap,This cable was perfect....exactly what I was hoping for. I don't see any glitchy or strange image quality that I was warned about with cheaper cables. This is cheap and good quality!
1,Crap....,"Well, I got scammed. These cables do not work. My Roku image was covered with static. Swapped cables with one I purchased a while back somewhere else (for about the same price) and it worked great. Do not buy these cables..."
1,Cable doesn't work,"The cable that I received does not work. When trying to hook up a device using the cable, the only image that comes on the screen is green and extremely fuzzy. I was extremely frustrated and dissatisfied with this, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I needed an HDMI cable, and I wanted it fast. This cable was the cheapest, and with the expedited shipping charge was about the same total out-of-pocket cost as the other brands. After all, who can screw up making a simple cable? Well, somewhere in China there is a manufacturer that found a way. This product does not work. You get what you pay for, and I was penny wise and pound foolish. Lesson learned."
1,"Low price, fast delivery, poor preformance","This cable was listed along with the ROKU. I thought for the low price, send it too. The ROKU comes with an A/V cable, not HDMI, so I ordered the HDMI cable. When connected to the HD TV, white flashes occured regularly. When I used the ROKU included A/V cable, no flashing, and a clear picture. The price of the HDMI was low enough to not warrant paying the return shipping. This one goes in the trash."
2,OK,this item was to short but it can still be use for something still pleased with it even though I am not using it at the moment.
1,You get what you pay for,"People on here even warned me, and I didn't listen. I needed a cord fast, and I didn't have much money.Well, it made my Blu-ray player start shorting out. We thought something was wrong with the machine itself. It would just stop playing the discs, and the screen would fill with static. Then it started happening when we were using the internet, not just playing discs. As soon as I replaced the cord, no more problems."
5,great & fast,Received the cable and compared it with another more expensive cable. I could not tell the difference.
1,Great price but bad product,"I needed one HDMI cable, but for this price I bought two. I plugged them both in and neither of them worked. They displayed broken images and cut in and out. I ended up just going to target and buying a more expensive one. I'm bummed that I didn't end up saving money like I thought I would. It has other good reviews, so for the price it might be worth a try, but the two I bought didn't work. oh well."
1,Doesn't work,"Tried this cable with the ROKU XS that arrived from Amazon today and it didn't work. Tried on 3 separate TVs and although the error messages varied, this cable failed to work on any of them while another cable from Amazon worked to the highest resolution supported by the particular TV. I am returning this cable in favor for the other type I purchased at nearly the same price."
3,okay,it didnt work well with my laptop but it works with my friends tv so I guess its an okay device
4,Good service spoiled by USPS,Cables are fine. Just takes forever for the Postal Service to get them to you.
3,You get what you pay for,"Is it cheap? Hell yes. Does it work? Only about 95% of the time. PS3 will blackout when using this cable and occasionally bluray movies do as well. Trust me, it's the cable and not my other hardware, I've checked it all. As soon as I use a different HDMI Cable the skipping stops. It is not frequent skipping so I don't mind. Would buy the cable again."
3,"Fair price, but problem with my setup","This product was a good value for the money. I used it with my Xbox 360 and LG 42LH90 television and it worked fine at 1080p/60 fps.However, when I connected the LG 42LH90 to a Samsung BD-C6500 Blu-Ray player, I found that 1080p/24 fps worked fine, but 1080p/60 fps displayed intermittent visual static and was unwatchable. I had purchased two of these cables and I tried both, yet the problem still remained. I tried the AmazonBasics 6' HDMI cable and the problem went away; 1080/60p with no problem.I was surprised to find that the cable was the problem. However, it worked fine with my Xbox 360, and ultimately was an inexpensive experiment. However, next time I would purchase the AmazonBasics cable instead."
4,Great Product fast Delivery,"I use one of these HDMI cables form my PS3, my XBox 360, and form my HD Direct TV and it works Great."
3,update on HDMI cable,Received the cable on 12-13-2011 with a $1.07 postage due. I received my Roku from Amazon and waited almost a week for the HDMI cable. I could not wait any longer to try out my Roku and decided the HDMI cable was lost in the mail and bought a cable locally. The cable I bought locally looks a lot better. I'm Glad I went ahead and bought a cable. Have not tried out the HDMI cable I got in the mail today yet. I plan on keeping the cable for future use.
5,Great Value,"This cable sells for pennies as opposed to being expensive at an electronics store.The cable is substantial, works great and is a real value"
5,Good cables,"These cables are better than I expected. They are thin wiring, but they still transmit the image and audio the way they are supposed to. I haven't had any problems, plug and play. They all work. I would definitely order them again, which I'm thinking I might actually do. I don't see any reason not to use these over the expensive Monster cables when they do the exact same thing."
1,Cheap Supplier: Cmple.com,"Cmple.com didn't pay enough stamp of US Postage, hence I had to drive to the Post Office to pay 1.08$ and it took almost a month in order to receive the cable. Really disappointed!"
5,Excellent product. Even better price!,Quality product for an unbelievable price. Don't pay $50 for the same quality product somewhere else. The picture and sound quality is just spectacular.
2,HDMI Cable $1.97,"Do not use this cable with any HD signal equipment. It can't handle it, bad picture. Amazon had it as a suggestion with some other item I looked at. It should not be a suggestion for an HD signal cable, as Amazon suggest. Maybe data only. I guess for $1.69, what do you expect."
5,"Good quality, cheap price",This product was exactly what I needed for my new Blu-ray player. And the best part is that it cost about 10% of what I would have paid in a retail store.
5,Stop paying so much for cables and buy these!!!,"Cables are the biggest scam in the industry. Buy the cheap ones and if there's a problem, just buy a few more. You could order 50 of these cables for the price Best Buy wanted to charge me for 1 pair!!!"
1,Image flickers,Connecting an XBox360 to an HDTV with this cable and the image will go black for about 3 seconds and then come back on. Happens every 20 minutes or so. Sucks. Something about the category not being right.
5,Not all the glistens is gold (Monster Cables),"I bought this ""Inspire"" cable the same day I bought my Samsung 32"" 720p tv, and it work flawlessly. It didn't come in the same day as my tv so I went to walmart and bought a $15 hdmi cable that was designed for the ""PS3."" It worked flawlessly, but was very thick and bulky. Basically got charged $13 more for a wire with less flexibility and a box with some advertising on it. My cable came in that I ordered a few days later and I unhooked the cable from walmart and plugged this one in. The PS3 never even noticed the switch and I've had no problems since. There is no point spending up to a $100 on a cable when you can purchase it for the price of a double cheeseburger. Don't listen to all the hype about, ""if it's made by monster than it's good,"" because you are just paying for a name. Don't get me wrong they have good stuff, but there's always something cheaper that will work just as well. Just try this cable out and you will have no disappointments."
4,Buy it!,"I use this to switch between PS3 & Direct TV HD DVR. Works great, turn on the PS3 and it automatically switches to the game console, turn the PS3 off and you're automatically switched back to HD TV signal. Perfect if you only have one HDMI input on your TV. The only fault is the LED is too bright, but that is easy to fix with a small piece elecrtical tape."
1,RIP OFF!,"I bought these cables and tried to connect a dvd player with them but they did not work. I guess the adage is true, ""you get what you paid for."" They were a complete waste of money for me, maybe they will work fine for you."
4,One out of two ain't bad! Works for my PS3!,"I ordered two of these cables because of the low price! When you consider shipping, it's not as cheap as you think. But it's definitely a lot lower than store prices ($15-35).I used the HDMI cable to hook up my PS3 to my 1080p LG 42"" display. When I hooked it up, I was disappointed to find that it didn't work. I tried everything and it didn't work. I was about to trash both cables but just to try it out, I plugged the other cable I bought and voila! It worked! So one out of two ain't bad. For the price, I think it was worth the risk! It works perfect and the quality is 1080p (identical in audio and video to the component cables that I have for the PS3)."
3,"For the price, it works.",I think that these can vary from one batch to another...the ones I got work perfectly fine for my laptop to my HD TV.
3,some audio dropouts,"Extraordinarily cheap HDMI cable, but I get some audio dropouts between the HD cable box and the HDTV. Using the same cable from my PS3 for Bluray, it works fine. I'm going to try the $10 cable from Monoprice as recommended by CNet."
1,Garbage in the form of cables,The only thing these cables are good for is hanging yourself for buying such stupid useless cables. Both arrived defective with no audio. After contacting the seller they decided that refunding 1/3 of what I paid was sufficient. If you buy these after reading this you are an idiot and deserve to be ripped off.
1,picture looked terrible,"I bought these to go along with my new TOshiba 40"" LCD 1080p. Have to say that while the cables ""worked"" - I had video and sound - the picture quality was pretty bad, noticeably worse than the component cables provided by my cable company. It sounds like plenty of people have been happy with these, so perhaps I got a lemon, but I'll be returning mine."
5,"It works, as any cable should. VERY happy with the price","It's just a cable, and it works as it should. I bought for my Western Digital My TV Live HD Media Player. The HDMI cables stocked locally in the stores start at around $20, so I was happy with price. Thanks much."
5,It's an HDMI cable and it works,Great deal. It works. What else do you want from a cable.I still need to write words to get to 20 so this can post.
5,HDMI cable,This is an excellent cable and well worth the money. I recommend this HDMI cable for anyone who is looking for a good cable at a good price.
5,Great cables,"I bought four of these cables. One for a PS3, two for Xbox 360's, and one as a back up. Almost a year after I purchased them they all still work fantastically! Never had a problem with any of them."
4,Great Deal for HDMI cables,When I saw the price these cable were listed for I had some doubts. I ordered them anyway and turns out they work great. Totally satisfied with the product.
2,Could be better,"You have to jiggle the cable to get it to work sometimes. You get what you pay for, I guess. Spend the extra few dollars and get a good one."
2,"Do you feel lucky, punk?",I got one of the 20% (just guessing) that don't work. Worked fine for about 3 months. Now about once a month when I go to watch a movie I get no audio and have to unplug/plug the cable to get it back. Next time I will spend a little more to improve my odds.
3,PS3 gameplay is grainy,"Stored HD video playback is flawless on my PS3 with this..HOWEVER, the problem comes when I insert a game disc into my PS3. The problem; very noticeable graining (or the snow effect) during game-play, with frequent flickering, and it will quickly get nauseating..In addition, I've also used this cord to connect my laptop to tv. It works fine in this instance."
5,SF Planet 6 bft HDMI cable,Cable took 10 days to arrive-Was sent 4th class mail.Made in China. It's 30 AWG rather than 28 AWG that most HDMI cables are but it's version 1.3.Although my new TV is 1080P capable the Cablevision cable box only provides 1080I.The cable works fine! Good value for [...] including shipping.
2,Didn't work well for my PS3.,"I always buy ultra-cheap HDMI cables from Amazon or Monoprice, and have never had problems before. This particle product was loose-fitting in both the PS3 and TV ports, and when I turned on the PS3, the video would judder every few seconds. By judder, I mean flashes of black would temporarily cover the screen.I will continue to buy cheap cables, but not this brand..."
5,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON EXPENSIVE CABLES!!!,"To anyone that is considering buying this no-name brand cable for your DVD up converters, PS3's (or other Blu-ray players), or any device that takes HDMI, I would highly recommend it!!! Other brand names like Monster***** over charge by at least 60% or more when this cable does exactly the same thing. Roll of thumb when buying cables, if your willing to wait a few days for shipping, never buy them in stores. For price crunchers these HDMI cords normally go for $30+, while online you can get them for about $3 with shipping.. Enjoy -- You just saved.."
4,Works fine with me....,"So far so good. I had a Monster Cable connecting my PS3 to my HD TV for a while. I bought another PS3 and decided to save some money by getting one of these cables through amazon because they were astronomically cheaper.It turns out that the quaily of picture is just about the same. I mean I can't see a difference. So, I highly reccomend this product."
3,Worked for a few years,"Worked for me for a few years, but seemed to have degraded over time. One of the cables is a bit burned, which might be caused by other factors (?), but now only outputs 720p. The other cable is in good condition still but only outputs 1080i instead of 1080p.I recently replaced these with HDMI cables that costed around $10 - hopefully spending a little more will make them last this time around..."
5,HDMI cable,we recently purchased a new TV but needed an additional HDMI cable. This cable was less expensive than than from a store. It came quickly.
3,it's ok,"Sin comentarios negativos, el articulo lleno mis expectativas y es tal cual se describe en la publicacion. La entrega fue a tiempo."
5,Works Great,These HDMI cables work as described. If the need arose again I would have not issues ordering these again. Inexpensive and work great!
4,cable -IS- HDMI 1.3,"Just a quick note in response to the person claiming the cable isn't HDMI 1.3 - the cable I received is, indeed, labeled HDMI 1.3b"
5,Great value for a High Quality product.,Shielded cable ensures high quality of video/audio transmission. The price is right for the 6ft length. Product speaks for itself.
2,works well for awhile,"Like some others have said - you get what you pay for. This cable worked well for awhile, but eventually developed bad connectivity problems where the pictured flickered in and out. For the price it's worth trying and maybe you'll get a good one that lasts."
4,Good product at a great price,"Had the cable now for a month and it gives a strong picture and good sound. Great value for the price, even if it stops working in a few months, you can buy 30 of these for the price of one in a normal store."
4,HDMI Cables,"I bought a Roku 2 XS- the high definition model, and wouldn't you know it? This High Definition model did not come with an HDMI cable. Even now companies are too cheap to include High-def cables.I looked around and by far these were the best for the price. They work as described and I have seen a huge difference in picture quality. I bought 2, I like to have extra cables around just in case I end up needing them in the future.I didn't give these the full 5 star love because of the shipping. It took almost 2 weeks for them to arrive, that's fine and all, but the company is literally 20 minutes away from where I live. I have no idea why they would take that long. Sad to see the price went up since I bought them."
2,HDMI CABLE,"Poor quality pictures, regreted buying it, but was cheap as salt. Guess you get what you pay for. Will rate you a (C)"
4,cheap and good,"many would think there is something wrong with the price, or that if it's this cheap it must be defective. none of the above. it's cheap and, so far, it works perfectly"
3,No cable for old men.,"I purchased two HDMI cables: this one, and a ""Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray"" (http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-Ultra-High-Version-Category-Blu-Ray/dp/B0019EHU8G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1239845997&sr;=1-1). I decided to upgrade to digital cables because the analog component cables I was using for my Dish Network box and DVD player would tire my eyes very quickly (I can't use analog cables for the computer monitor for the very same reason).It seems, after all, that not all HDMI cables are created equally. This cable is about three times thinner than the Mediabridge. Consequently, the refresh rate doesn't seem to be as good, and it's very hard to focus when you're reading text--much like it is with analog cables. The Mediabridge, on the other hand, produces a very clean image. It feels like you're looking at a continuous flow of images rather than a bunch of moving pixels."
2,Not Category 2 certified,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this cable is not Category 2 certified which means it has not undergone testing to verify that it works consistently for 1080p. Because this particular cable is so short, you most likely will be able to get away with this ""non high-speed"" cable and pass 1080p without a problem. However, there is no guarantee. Also, Category 2 cables are rated at 340Mhz and support the ""x.v Color"" and ""Deep color"" modes that newer TV's are supporting.[...]I've had problems with this cable. I've seen the ""red sparkle"" effect on my TV while watching Blu-ray movies and I believe the source was this cable. I'm not going to return this cable because the shipping costs more than the $.92 product. For $.92, you get what you pay for.Pay the $3-$5 and get a good cable."
2,not bad but not quite as pictured,"i bought this cable because i had recently bought a new dvd player that upscales and wanted to see if it made a visual difference. now in the picture for the hdmi cable it shows gold connectors, they have a slight gold hue in the right light i guess but def not gold. silver connectors would better describe. as for picture quality it seems pretty good. I don't have another cable to compare too. So i would have to say if you have a setup on your tv using a hdmi cable that is more expensive than, try one of these if you buy a new component to hook up it was cheap and if gave picture and sound.i will update if i come across a monster cable and give a comparison."
3,questionable,I bought this to hook up my blu-ray up to my full high definition tv. It was my understanding that the cable I was buying was 1080p compatible. when i got the cord an hooked it up i would get signal for 5 sec. then it would go black then i decided to hook up the HDMI cable that came with my xbox to make sure it wasn't the blu-ray player and it turned out it was the cable. Then I decided to double check the problem and hook up the HDMI cable i bought to my xbox 360 and it worked but my tv told me it was only signaling in 1080i which is a step down from 1080p. I thought about returning it but for a game system I didn't think there was going to be much of a difference so i decided not to.
1,Worthless!,"Its cheap for a reason!! This cable produced a barely viewable picture, with interference lines across the screen, and was a waste of money. Spend the extra, and get something worthwhile. Its a pointless purchase."
1,Update August 2 2012 - Don't Purchase this Go elsewhere,"Order shipped 2 days via Amazon prime, cable works fine, have had for 90 days.For the price, highly recommend.Update: August 1, 2012 - dropped from 5 to 3 stars.This cable stopped functioning and I had to replace it. I have mixed feelings. It only cost a couple bucks, but failed in less than 1 year. I feel it should have lasted longer, but at least I didn't spend $20.00 bucks on it. Looking for a more reliable alternative and have heard that Mono price cables are highly rated.Update: August 2, 2012.Contacted SF Planet to get this exchanged. Original cable died. This item is listed as having a lifetime warranty, however, SF Planet says otherwise and only warranties this for 30 days. I have cables that I've used for years and this one didn't even last 9 months."
5,Best HDMI cable,"First of all, let me tell you that copper is a good conductor. So you really do not need those gold cables. You can't even wear them around your neck. This cable though might be cheap by price, works perfectly. I've been using it for a month without a problem. Don't spend extra bucks on those fancy HDMI cables. This works for connecting my TV to a laptop and also my iPad through a HDMI adapter. Worth Every penny. If it is still under $2, steal it."
1,Sux,"Couldn't believe the cable was just $1.78 ... now I know why! I tried to plug in an HP 2159 monitor to a Dell laptop ... to replace a much longer higher-cost cable that I had been using. Got nothing but ""Check Cable"" messages on the monitor.I always say ""You get what you pay for"" ... didn't follow my own advice this time! Duh. Not even worth returning."
1,Straight to the TRASH,There is no reason to pay $20 or even $10 for a 6' HDMI cable. I have been purchasing very good quality cables on line for $2 to $3. Thought I would try these. Wasted my time and money. I ordered 3 and none worked (my old cables worked fine). These things are clearly junk. I recommend you look some place else. There are lots of better cables at not much more money. Cannot recommend these!
4,You get what you pay for. Not recommended for 1080p,"This HDMI Cable is great for devices 1080i and 720p. I use it for a Roku HD player and the HD movies i stream are nice. As for 1080p, its better to buy a more expensive cable like Monster to get high picture quality. I have a monster cable for my blu-ray player and tried out this HDMI cable to see if there was a difference and there was. The picture quality was a bit grainy and was not as sharp. As the title says you get what you pay for and if you need a cable for your non 1080p devices, this one will do."
2,Horrible Quality - Buy Something Else,"I bought this cord thinking it was a cheap alternative to the other $7+ cords out there. When I finally received this cord, the quality from my cable box to my LED TV was horrible. Outlines of people and objects were fuzzy and made me want to yank the cord out right away. I would recommend a better quality (meaning more expensive) cord."
4,"Good Quality, Great Price","In a world of overpriced HDMI cables, this cable comes to the rescue. Good quality and performance at a great price. Delivery fast and efficient."
2,poor image quality,"When I fist got this cable I used it for a my ps3 games and I did not notice anything and I thought it was a wonderful cable. However I recently started to notice an issue with my blu-ray films having some issue with noise in the form of grainy-ness and some grid patterns. At first I thought it was the recording but I soon discovered that it was this cable. I switched cables to one of the Phillips brand cables and it cleared the picture. If you are at all picky with full HD image quality I would not recommend this cable. You don't need to overpay for an HDMI, but the $8 Phillips cable has worked perfectly with no image degradation."
1,Iffy cables...,I got my cables and tried using them to go between my MacBook and a new monitor. I have a mini-display to HDMI adapter that works very well with the HDMI that came with the monitor (very high quality). Neither of these cables (I got two) actually work with this combination. I gave them to other people to use for their blu-ray players and so far they are working fine for both video and audio.
1,Bad wire!,"I too was influenced by this cheap hdmi wire. As soon as I got it, I hooked it to my PS3 and I hear the PS3 sound when it comes on. Sharp picture and the system automatically detects the wire. So far so good as I thought. But when I put in a game....I hear NOTHING. At all. I tried different ports and nothing. Anyone who wants to purchase a cheap HDMI wire, AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COST!"
2,hdmi cable,"ordered the product, two weeks after I should have received the cable they shipped another.Exactly what I ordered for a great price just took more than twice the time to receive ( more than a month)."
1,worst scam ever,"ITS A SCAM!! I read the other reviews before i bought this due to its low price, and they were all pretty good. I tried hooking it up to my xbox 360 and it didnt even recognize a signal. Destination: trash can."
5,HDMI CABLE,This is just your standard HDMI cable. Amazon had a great price on this. dont buy into the hype of paying $$$$$$$$$$$$ for monster cables. the human eye won't know.
1,Not Good!,"I was a believer that all HDMI cables were created equal...well, I draw the line with these. The connectors just didn't quite fit my TV. They did go in, but felt like metal on metal. On one TV, I couldn't get any signal. On another TV with the right touch I could get a picture but with occassional flickers in the picture. I do not recommend these."
3,All right!!,I bought this one along with some other HDMI cables. Working fine so far. Not sure whether it is delivering all the data speed to the other end or not.
5,Happy customer,Shipping was as quick as promised. The cables work just as great as the 120$ monster cable I bought when I didnt know what I was doing. The cable is everything promised and sends a clear 1080p signal
5,hooah,Great price and ok shipping charges. Why do all of the companies double the shipping when you want to buy two items? Or triple when you want three? That's the turnoff with these companies.
5,Who knew?,This item greatly improved my film watching. Go figure... this little cable made a hell of a difference in picture compared to the traditional wiring.
5,"easy, cheap, and of fine quality","Do NOT buy expensive HDMI cables at a big box store. There's just no reason. Pay $40 more for cables with colorful, snazzy ends if you want, but just know that's all you're getting. The cheap ones work just as well as the the expensive ones."
3,too thin,"I ordered 5 of them cause of the reviews and the price. They are ok, but too thin for some devices and make a little noise. I thought something was wrong with my device or the dvd I was playing. You get what you pay for."
2,Got what I paid for.,"I guess I was expecting something of a higher quality, but considering it's under $3, I got what I paid for. Mine only lasted a month, if that. Just stopped working completely without any visible damage. Bought a $10 hdmi cable and I'm already glad I decided to pay the extra. Don't waste your money on this, because you'll end up having to buy another one anyways. I mean, it worked well for when it did, but it just didn't last long at all.Ended up buying this one after:Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D & Audio Return Channel [Latest HDMI Version Available] - (6 Feet)"
5,Excellent Value,"I got this product over 1 month ago and have had no issues with it at all. The price obviously is the best thing about it, but the quality of the product is also very good. Speed is good, picture and audio are great.So far, I have only hooked up my PS3 and my Xbox 360, but Blu-Ray quality is great through the PS3, and games look great on both systems.I have yet to get HD cable, or a true Blu-Ray player, but I am happy with the uses I have had with these cables thus far.I highly recommend these cables, they are a great alternative to spending $30-$60 on basic to high-end HDMI's."
3,4 HDMI cables.,"I bought 4 Cables for my 46"" LCD 1080P TV. One for my PC, Cable Box,and PS3. I have a Reciever that will pass through this signal to my TV, which is what I planned to use the 4th cable for. It works for my PC, haven't had any real problems with it yet. The cable box says my tv won't support and HDBI cable, which is BS because i spent $1200 on my TV. I usually just turn off and on the TV and it ends up working. The quality came through pretty bad for my PS3. It had a stuttering image and there were white spots popping up everywhere. It'll do the job for a low performance job, like my PC. But it won't work for a PS3. Couldn't beat the price though."
1,Dosnt work 1080p or any resolution,"Tested on 2 TVs with my Laptop. One TV got no signal at all, the other got a signal but had a horrible picture and the sound was messed up. I changed to low resolutions but this did not fix the problem on either TV. Went to Walmart and bought their cheapest cable, which wasn't cheap ($27). It worked perfect on both TVs in 1080p. I wouldn't get anything out of returning the cable since all the price is in the shipping. This cable must work for some applications, as some have claimed it to work. However, it didn't work with my laptop so if this is what you intend to use it for, find a better cable."
1,Low signal quality.,"This cable works great about 98% of the time, but the other 2% of the time I get sparkles on 1080p tv. I have done my best to eliminate any possible interference which may be affecting the signal as it travels over the cable, but the problem remains.For the $0.90 the cable cost I can not really complain much about this, however if you have an HD tv the last thing you want is to have to deal with sparkles on an otherwise beautiful image. Buyers be warned, my cable was probably just of lower quality than most (judging by the number of good reviews), but you too may get a bad one."
1,wrong item,the item i recieved was not what i wanted. i needed an hdmi to connect my ps3 to my tv. what i got had one end that was really small and didn't fit either one. i couldn't tell that from the picture. i was so mad i threw the cord in the trash. i only paid three dollars with shipping but it still didn't matter because i was looking forward to seeing my games in hd.
5,Great deal and works flawlessly!,"At $1.17 (and free shipping to boot!), you can't get better than this deal! I bought this for my flat screen tv which had a HDMI input. I used this cable to connect my tv to my cable, and was amazing the difference a cable can make! This makes watching tv even more enjoyable!"
3,Questionable Quality,"I ordered two of these cables, and so far, for the price, they deliver. They seem to do 1080P without any problems. However, the construction quality is a little bit questionable. The cables are rather thin, and if any part of the cable is at a slightly bad angle, you will see artifacts.For the price, they are decent. I doubt I will buy any more of these cables though, as for a few more dollars, cables with better construction quality and that are less fussy can be bought (no, not Monster or any of the overpriced cables, but another company that makes generic cables quite well).Update 1/30/2012: One of the cables gives severe artifacts no matter what. Go with Monoprice for cables."
5,Never Buy a Cable at Big Box Retail Store,"I bought two cables and had them expressed shipped, and it was still $30-$100 cheaper than buying one cable from a big-box retail store! I now get full 1080p HD picture from my PlayStation 3 and XBOX 360 and have noticed no problems with my $13.00 cables (with the shipping and handling it was about that much per). Despite what salesmen will tell you, there is absolutely no difference between these cheapo cables and the ones that will leave your wallet empty at the store."
5,Excellent value!,"Monster cables are an absolute ripoff, if these cables are good enough to be used in cnet's test labs, they're good enough for your living room."
5,works great,I have a monster cable hdmi I paied 150.00 dollars for and I see no differance In this one vs that one. Works great and what a price.
4,Good for the price...,"Wasn't quite the product I was looking for, but I don't really know what I am looking for! :) The ones I bought last time work great. I purchased this one for the PS3 and I didn't realize it was a differnt shape."
1,Did not work,"Like another reviewer, I have to repeat ""you get what you pay for."" Did not work for my Roku player, or computer. Brought it into Radioshack, and they said it was ""dead."" Only lost a couple of dollars, but I see no point in ordering again."
3,"Great price, could use some work on response time.","At under $2, this was an absolute steal for an HDMI cable, and because it was so cheap, we chose to pay for the rush delivery to get it here even faster. We paid roughly $9.50 for the shipment so that we could have it in one or two days, however, the seller didn't actually ship the item until 4 days after we placed the order, which made paying for the rush delivery a little pointless, in my opinion. As far as that goes, I feel a little ripped off, but the item arrived promptly after it shipped and would have worked fine, had my boyfriend's TV cooperated. Still a great buy.Seller really needs to work on response time, however. If you're expecting to get your items quickly, it won't do you much good to throw in the extra cash for the rush option. Just an FYI."
1,Junk!,"I ordered this HDMI cable to connect my IPAD 3 to my TV to watch Netflix Instant movies on the big screen. When I connected it all I heard while playing the movie was random static noises, the voice from the movie will come in sporadically and the picture was frozen. I swapped the cable out for a more expensive HDMI cable I had at home previously and Bingo! everything started working as it should.I guess I got what I paid for, do not waste your time by buying this cable, it is nothing but junk - end of story."
5,I love it because it's CHEAP!,"I needed an HDMI cable to simple connect my laptop to my 52in LCD whenever I have presentations. Since I didn't use it that often, I didn't want to spend $40-$100 on something I only use 5-10 minutes a week.This cable offers great results for PowerPoint and video transmissions. I had to show a clip from a Blue Ray movie and it performed admirably. I couldn't really tell the difference between watching the disc through the computer and through another cable I paid $40 for on my Playstation 3."
2,Green-streaks using Roku HD,"Audio, video are transmitted, but the video displays green streaks, about 5 streaks per video frame, and jumping all around. Like a light snow effect. Not worth watching when other cables display perfectly.Even after squeezing and compressing the cable at various points to see if the image quality improved I did not experience any additional joy.Dunno if it's this model or my individual unit, but considering I paid $1.76 I'm not super concerned. Will buy a different HDMI cable, still going for el-cheapo but maybe not el-supremo-cheapo. Your mileage may vary."
5,"Cheap, works as it should.",I was a little skeptical when I first purchased this cable. I know have three of them in use and I have not had a single problem. Buy it!
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this product, and it arrived quite quickly. The price was astonishing, considering the prices of HDMI cables at outlets like Best Buy and others. (beginning at $39 and moving up into the $100's of dollars.) I'd read that expensive cables were a waste of money, so I thought I'd give this product a try. Does it work? Yes, there is video and audio that comes through. Does it work well? Not particularly; the video level is low, ie, the picture is darker than normal. For some, this may be an acceptable limitation for a product that is fabulously priced. As is often said, you get what you pay for. Given the price, I can't complain. But I switch to a different, more expensive cable whenever watching a movie I really want to enjoy."
4,Good for normal use,"This cable is adequate for use under normal conditions, and you simply cannot beat the price I paid (just over $3. Including shipping). If you need it for a use that requires a more heavily shielded cable then this is not the cable for you. But, why spend $40. for a cable when this one is useful and very economical in normal situations."
4,Gets the job done.,"Couldn't pass up the price & best of all. It gets the job done same as the others with a ""monster"" price."
4,reaqsonable,quiet good it does the job that it is made for that's all I can say cheap for the price just took a bit to long to get here
2,Does not meet the expectation,"It failed to transmit the needed signal strength from my PS3. that too for 720P. wondering how the games in 1080P worked though !!! Had to buy a branded, good quality HDMI from SONY to get rid of the problem.Also, the screen used to flicker and sometimes lost signals using this cheap quality cables. would not buy it again or suggest any one to go for this low quality items."
3,good one,"Price wise good product but same time quality wise it's not good. I bought 2 HDMI cable, with in 2 days one got stopped working."
4,Works Great,"I hate the idea that you need to pay an arm and a leg for HDMI connections. This one works just fine. I laugh when I go to the big box stores and see people getting two and three of them at a time for 40 60 or 100.00. It's a connector people, there is NO data to back up any of the claims from MONSTER cables. Ah well. A fool and his money are soon parted."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR--DONT DO IT--,I HAVE A 50IN HD PLASMA WITH TIME WARNER CABLE (HD)I HAVE A PERFECT PICTURE BUT NO SOUND.............I SHOULDVE KNOW BETTER. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. DO NOT BUY THIS. BUY SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE.
3,didn't,Bought it because I thought I needed it. its just a USB cable like any other nothing special. Make sure you need it
3,A bit short,"This cable won't work for a lot of your gaming or TV needs, because it is too short to stretch the length most entertainment centers require. However, if you have two items on top of each other, this is a worthwhile purchase."
2,HDMI cable,"Didn't need it for what I am doing. I now have another cable to put with all those phone cords. You know whenever someone buys a new phone you get new phone cords, that are 6 feet long and your phone is 10 feet from the plug, I will put this in that shoe box of un-needed cords. But thanks anyway."
4,Worth risking!,"I rate these 4 stars only because when I plugged them into my laptop to display on my HDTV red lines appeared on certain parts of the screen. However, when I plugged them into my PS3 the images were perfect, and I saw literally no difference between these cables and the $30 ones I got from best buy.Even though these did not work correctly with my laptop, they still work with other things, and because of the price it's better to just buy them and see if they will work for you rather than going out and spending more for a ""heavy duty cable"".Great product, the shipping was great too."
4,"Works great. I'm not an expert, but I'm happy with it!","I don't know much about tech stuff, but I have a Sony 40"" 1080p, and HD looks great with this cable."
5,Inexpensive quality cable,"Like everyone else says, don't spend alot of money on an HDMI cable. Get a cheap one. If it doesn't work, return it. If it does, you saved yourself $20 or more.This cable works great. I don't have a 1080 tv to check it out on, so I can't comment on that. Everything else is great."
4,My first HDMI Cable,"First HDMI cable I needed. Super fast shipping. Not the best, but for the price, YOU CAN'T BEAT IT!"
1,You get what you pay for,This cable doesn't work for streaming video. I suggest spending a few more dollars for a better quality cable. Lesson learned.
5,WORKS GREAT!,Purchased for a great price and haven't had any problems with it. Superior quality and does the job flawlessly. Would reccomend for sure.
2,"it works, kind of","The chord arrived very quickly. My only complaint is the fact that when connecting my laptop to the TV I get a lot of feedback. I'm not sure if this is the fault of the cable or machines, however the feedback is still there regardless."
5,HDMI cable,I couldn't believe the cost. Approximately $3.00 no tax. Brandsmart has the same cable for $50.+ It works perfectly with my new HD tv (750 samsung). It arrived in 4 days. I highly recommend.
5,"CHEAP, works as intended","In short, there's absolutely no reason to pay over $10 for an HDMI cable. As other's have already stated, with a digital signal shielding from interference isn't necessary, so the makeup of the cable has no impact on image quality. Having said that, this cable is still built really well, with gold plated connecters and solid plastic. I've purchased two of these, one for my PS3 and a second for my HD box on my HDTV, and I've experienced no issues. Unless you can find a cheaper cable or need a longer cable, DEFINITELY purchase this guy."
2,Bad Cable,"I don't want to jinx a product that has a great reputation so far, because I know there are defects during production, but when I received this product it had a connector on it that was not attached properly. It was allowing the audio signal to travel through the cable, but not the video. If I moved the cable around it acted like it had a short in it allowing me to see the video when I held it in one place.I had to go to the store and purchase another HDMI cable, and the new one worked fine letting me know the problem was the cable.I am not going to give it 1 star due to the fact that I have not returned the cable for another one, but be aware there is a possibility for a defect, as is the case with any product. :)Great deal however as far as cost goes."
5,Works Well,Don't let the insanely low price fool you - This works as well as the last HDMI cable I purchased at the Big Box store for $25. I'm stocking up on these!
5,Using on PS3,"Using for my Ps3 and can not give any negative rating.This provides DVI, which is audio and video over HDMI."
4,OK,These were cool cuz they were a lot cheaper than buying them in a store. So buy 'em online and save big $.
5,"works, isnt 20$","Best cable i've ever bought for 5 bucks. works as intended and ive seen comparable cables up to 30$. Try and beat that, Best buy!"
5,great perfect,"All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase.I received this from my girlfriend for my birthday and love it. ”"
4,Pretty Decent HDMI Cable,"I wasn't looking to spend a lot, so I went with these. They're doing the job."
5,"A $100.00+ FOR A HDMI CABLE, I DONT THINK SO!!!!!!!! THIS HDMI CABLE IS AN AMAZING POSITIVE HIGH QUALITY BUY!!!!!!!!!","This is a great HDMI cable buy. It works just as good as those $100.00 cables, the big stores try to push on you. I am amazed at the high quality of this inexpensive cable. I was always hesitant to buy an HDMI cable because of the insane prices. After I found out about this HDMI cable I was hesitant to buy it because of the very low price. This HDMI cable is flawless and performs beautifully. Great buy and highly recommended ...."
1,Poor video quality,"I was a bit skeptical of the good reviews of this cable considering the low price. This is a case of getting what you pay for, at least in my experience. The video quality was far worse than using the component audio/video inputs. I ended up replacing this cable with one of better quality --- and more money. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
5,Why pay more?,"This works perfectly. I'm watching a blu-ray movie on my hdtv with this and I see no visual problems. For 22 cents, why not? I suppose if you're a perfectionist you can but that 100 dollar psyclone cable at best buy, but this cheap cable seems like a... better buy."
5,BUY FROM VORTEX CABLE. What a deal!,"Great, high quality cable! Highly recommend you buy it from Vortex Cable. What a deal and they shipped it very fast. I'm returning my Monster cable to Best Buy, now that this one works just as well and no difference in quality."
3,Iffy Cable...,"Not sure if this is the cables fault. But, I get extreme ghosting of the black famly of colors (grays)... All other parts of the image seem solid. I'm running this cable in 720p at a 8 ms respons time. The ghosting I'm talking about isn't interlaced ghosting.If I look at a gray based image then move the screen to a lighter or darker color... You can see the outlines of the image I looked at. It wont go away for awhile either or it will smear the gray around if you continue to move the image slightly in the gray area.This is while playing Resistance: Fall of Man on PS3. This game is heavy with grays. Motorstorm on the other hand seems to have no or very little issues with ghosting (because it's mostly dirt colored).The pyhsical appearance of this cable is great. It is gold plated and seems to be build well.I'm going to try a Monster Cable out. Hopefully I have better luck with them."
5,"Works great, great price!!",We got this for my son after Christmas - the stores were sold out except for the $30+ ones. This one was $4 with shipping! We used it for his blue ray player. Picture is great! I'm very happy with this purchase!!
3,A bit hit or miss,"I bought three of these HDMI cables and two of them work perfectly. The third cable is patchy and fails to deliver all of the data from my dvd or cablebox to my tv, but at only a penny (+ shipping) you can afford to buy a few of these and still not pay what you'd pay for one HDMI cable elsewhere."
3,Good for the Price,"Currently using this hdmi cable with a ps3. Doesn't seem to have a problem outputting except when trying to switch the connection to the 360 the cable has a problem outputting the digital code onto the TV. Also bought a higher end hdmi cable for the 360, which doesn't seem to have a problem when switching from the ps3 to the xbox 360. Still for the cost of this cable definitely worth it."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this cable, hoping that it would be a reasonable substitute to the $50 cords sold in stores. Initially, the cable worked perfectly, but after around two months of normal use (it was basically untouched and stayed plugged in) it began to cut out, making it useless for high-def gaming. I guess two months for $1.09 isn't so bad though. I could buy 45 of these cables instead of a $50 cable somewhere else, and those 45 cables would last me about 7.6 years at the current rate..."
3,Didn't work for 1.3 HDMI device,The product description didn't state if it was or wasn't HDMI ver 1.3. It was cheap when I bought the tv so I bought it. It does work with a pre HDMI ver 1.3 device. The vendor could not tell me if it was or wasn't ver 1.3. I had read it didn't matter if a cable was 1.3 or not to work with a 1.3 device. In my case it did matter.
5,"Digital is digital, don't get ripped off","I decided to take a gamble on these cables thinking I wouldn't be out much if they didn't work. Let me tell you what, I couldn't be happier with this cable. I have it hooked up to an xbox 360, and watching upscaled DVD movies with it look awesome (as do the games). I'm very pleased."
2,Bought for PS3. . .three separated cables did not work properly,I purchased four of these cables because they were selling for a great price. I gave one away without trying it. I plugged the other three in to my PS3 and receiver. NONE of the three worked properly. I then tried one of the cables with my 360 and it worked fine. I'm not sure what's going on here. I can only imagine that they cannot support 1080p. The individual bags said 1.3 so. . .I don't know.I've purchased approximately 10 HDMI cables and paid less than $5 for all of them. Most have worked just fine. You definitely don't need to spend more than $10-15 or so on an HDMI cable. I would just recommend not buying this particular cable.
4,Good Value,good value but they didnt call when my item was returned to them until i left a bad review in which they finally called to tell me what happened and fixed it
4,Just as advertised,These HDMI cables work exactly as you would expect high dollar cables to work. They have been working flawlessly for us connected first to a DVD player and then DVR. Great buy for the money!
5,It works,"What's more to say? It works. It does exactly what it's supposed to, but I wouldn't mind if it started spitting money out one end or something."
5,Works as Advertised,"Great price, and exactly what I was looking for. Don't shelling out loads of cash for the Monster or other brands that charge a lot more $$$$$! These are just as good and delivers the HD picture that you're looking for."
4,Great value!,Good quality cord for a very reasonable price. No need to spend 50 bucks on an HDMI cable when this one is just as good and a fraction of the price.
5,Works as expected,"Works great and way better than buying expensive hdmi cables at Best Buy for 50+ dollars. A cable is a cable, the brand doesn't matter. I would definitely buy more of these in the future."
1,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for. When I saw the price of this cable and the fact that it had FREE shipping too. I thought why not. Can't go wrong for $2, well yes you can. The quality is awful, not even worth $2. Spend a bit more and buy the $10 one from Walmart, I think it is Ematic."
5,Great Buy,"It never made much sense to pay big bucks for a simple cable. This one is marked HDMI on the connectors, seems well made, works fine and it arrived quickly by USPS. I really can't expect more."
1,Product doesn't work....,"The product did not work. I was not overly optimistic because it was pretty cheap, but plain and simple, it does not work."
5,HDMI cord,"I chose not to use this cord. It may be fine but the cable is about half as thick as any other HDMI cable I have seen. The cable was a throw in with other purchases. So, I spent some money and bought a cable I knew would provide high quality picture and sound"
4,HDMI Cable,"I use this cable for connecting my notebook with the 26"" LDC monitor. I compared it with the DVD player with component cable on same movie. The picture quality is way better. It worths the money for the low price."
5,as advertised,great and cheap great and cheap great and cheap great and cheap great and cheap as advertised as advertised as advertised awesome these cables are the best
5,Works Great!,"I had my doubts buying this product for only $1.87 and actually getting, but it also works just like a normal HDMI cable you would normally buy at the store for $36.00+ I should of bought another while I was at it. Happy with this product :)"
5,Works Well!,"This HDMI Cable works very well. I use it connect my laptop to multiple televisions and the clarity and sound are great.Please note that the 6 feet may seem like a lot, but some TVs need to be connected in the back. In this case, make sure you have space nearby to place your laptop during usage. Also, (only) the first time you use it, you will probably have to default your speakers to the TV speakers so the sound works."
1,garbage,Product sucks. Didn't work correctly from the minute I plugged it in. It's worth the money to spend 25 bucks on one that will work.
1,Horrible cable.,"Very displeased with this cable, it was only $2.50 but I think mine is defective.I use it for my computer monitor and I get these white pixels that jump around the screen.Very displeased with this cable. You get what you pay for I guess."
5,Low price and it works,I was insecure about purchasing cheap HDMI cables but these turned out fine; they worked the 1st time. No flicker. Two for $4.28
3,HDMI Cable,"The cable seems to be fine but the delivery was hampered by what the company described as lost mail by the PO. Regardless, it took a little more than two weeks for this item to arrive."
5,Perfect for Xbox 360! How was it? like 29 cents? cant beat that price anywhere!,This worked perfect for my 360. Stores charges $40 for these cables i bought one here for like a quarter plus shipping. Cannot beat that price anywhere!
4,Cable hdmi,"Todo bien, llego a la medida que era,, llego rapido. El cable es muy bueno!! Lo recomiendo 100% El embalaje todo bien!"
3,Old cable or $3 cable?,"I bought a couple of these a year ago when I got my new TV - one for the PS3 and one for the Satellite receiver - connected directly to the tv and carrying video only. We had a big old amp that carried the sound and as it didn't take HDMI, this all went old school with rca. So today we finally replaced the amp and I discovered the limitation of this cable. I guess it is possible that the cable aged, but it's only been a year, so I will assume I just didn't notice the problem before as I had no used it to carry any audio. Any audio streamed from the PS3 was choppy - dropped out every couple of seconds. DVD and Bluray was fine, but Instant Video, Netflix, Music - all choppy and unacceptable. I changed the audio back to the PS3's original rca cord and the audio was fine - I replaced this HDMI cable with a new 'Amazon Basics' one purchased this week and the audio is perfect. Watch out!"
3,Deal for the $.,"Good quality for the money, These small purchases are key to conserving cash because of the huge profit margin built into similar items locally."
5,"For the price, it delievers GREAT results.","Apparently, according to my science teacher, the difference between prices is the quality of the conducting metal inside the cord, which lets it last longer. However, for at least a month, $1 is amazing quality compared to $60 - $250. It plays accurately, little/no lag at all, great sound/picture quality & has perfect length. Even if it does die, another $1 is alot more affordable. Anyone would be stupid not to grab a couple of these."
1,Poor quality,"I figured these were cheap enough to give them a shot, but it turns out they are not worth the money. I bought 4 to connect my laptop to my tv and 2 of them don't work at all and the other 2 work but have horrible quality. When I use the HDMI cable I got with my xbox it works fine but when I use one of these the sound is grainy, the picture is grainy and choppy. They are completely unusable for what I bought them for."
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH PS3,"My Tv is HD, and the maximum resolution is 1080p. However, when I plugged it in, the highest resolution I got was 480p. I tried changing the Display settings both on my ps3 and the Tv, but nothing worked."
5,Working as expected..!!,I bought this item just to hook up my Acer AO722 netbook to HDTV. It works fine... !!!! I got one month amazon prime membership and I love watching yellowstone HD documentary on TV..Thanks to this cable.
3,Review on 2M 6 Feet DVI Gear HDMI Cable,"No comment. Since I still haven't used the DVI Gear HDMI Cable, and as far as its quality is concerned, there's nothing for me to comment at this moment. on its quality."
5,Really Good,"When it arrived there was nothing wrong with it, it was long enough, and it worked 100%. Good product, recommend to anyone looking for and HDMI cable."
3,Works for everything but...,"I bought this to go with my xbox 360 elite that i just bought. they work great! but the only thing is, I get a pink screen when I play DVDs or stream Netflix videos... they are great for backup cables if im in a jam, but now i need to go by some other cables that work for all of it. thought I could get away with it but no luck..."
2,you get what you pay for,"very thin diameter needed to use better cable to set up my cable box then switched it and it works, but picture doesn't seem as clear as with bigger cable"
4,Does the job,"Good price, does the job. I will be back again because I know I am going to buy something that will need an HDMI....very soon."
3,its ok,"The cables are not the best at all, in fact you get what you pay for. They get the job regardless and it looks better than the regular red white and yellow cables"
5,Low price Great Quality,"Delivery sucked, I was supposed to get this cable in 2 days being a Prime member, but took almost a week to get it. But the quality was great. Works the same as $70 cable from Best Buy, but at fraction of the price. Used to connect my ps3 to 60"" plasma and Audio/Video quality is perfect.Would recommend this product to everyone, hope seller finds a better carrier to ship these items like UPS/FedEx instead of DHL Global half way and then USPS the other half.All in all.. Great product. Please get this and save your money instead of buying it from Best Buy. For the same money you spend on a cable @ Best buy, you can buy a Blu-Ray player and still save monies."
5,great price,These perform just as good as the more expensive name brand cables for a fraction of the price a great buy.
1,Loose Connectors,I received the item with both connectors being slightly loose from the plastic molding. It caused static and lines on my video display. I replaced the chord with a similar HDMI cable and it was fine. I don't know if it's an isolated incident but it's not even worth returning. The shipping might cost more than the HDMI cable itself. Buyer beware.
5,"Great price, Great quality....","I have purchased a total of 6 of these HDMI cords and they work great! Picture and sound quality are great and you can't beat the price! Please don't get sucked into store reps telling you that you need to purchase the $50 monster cables! I also have friends and family that have purchased these cords and have had no problems with them. I currently am using it for my 2 direct TV HD boxes, blu ray player, PS3 and Xbox 360 (newest version). Everything is hooked up to two separate HDTVs (a Vizio and Samsung) and have had no problems. A must buy for you HD nuts out there like me!"
3,hmi flickers,ive gotten better quality cable on ebay for the same amount.the cable is thin and i hooked up my ps3 with it and now get a flicker on the screen so i switched it out
5,Good cables.,"These cables are a little bit more expensive than the real cheap ones but when i put my tv up i did not want to take it back down so i used these instead of the cheaper ones. The cheaper ones i have put in use in an easy to reach place so when i have to change it out it will be easy,"
2,Great Video..Iffy Audio,"So the shipping and all that was fine. When I initially plugged this cable in, things were beautiful. But after a day, the cable would randomly start to cause a popping/scratchy noise from my tv speakers. The only thing that would stop the scratching sound was me wiggling the cable around.Needless to say, you're taking a gamble by getting this cable. I've decided that my gamble failed, and I'm gonna order another one now."
4,nice cable,Provides good picture and sound at a great price! Can't beat it! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good hdmi cable
5,"Great Product, Great Price","Purchased a new TV for my bedroom. Thought I had an HDMI cable laying around, but of course, I did not. Looked around at the big box stores, but didn't want to pay the $30+ that they were asking, so I checked out Amazon and found this great product. This cable works great! The only thing that's better than the product itself is the price of the product! I've told everyone I know to get it from here if they ever need a new HDMI cable. You can't beat the price and the shipping was fast."
4,It works,Its cheaper than buying the same cord from the name brand stores that always try to sell it to you the same minute you purchase your HD tv. They charge 50 and better for these inexpensive cables if there is a difference with the end results of the name brand cable and this one please let me know.
5,great product at cheaper price & great shipping,Great service. Product arrived withing 4-5 days much earlier than promised date. Highly recommend at the price.
3,Worked Well ... For Awhile,"When I decided to pick up HDMI cable to hook my Playstation 3 up to my LCD TV, I researched the format and found out that a lot of HDMI cable is priced expensively for no reason other than to fool consumers into thinking it's better than other HDMI cable. With that in mind I purchased this HDMI cable. It worked great...for awhile. Then, a few months after I received it, the cable suddenly stopped working and will not work at all. I don't know whether this happens often with this product or whether this was an isolated incident, which is why I'm going to give the product a 3 star rating."
3,This performed as expected,"The price that Best Buy charges for these things is outrageous. Do some research on the wires and components, then get them online and know that they aren't going last forever. The length is good and I think if you plug them in and leave them, they will last much longer than if you are moving them around and plugging and unplugging them. They're cheap, so get more than one pair if you need them."
5,just what expected.,"I got it in the mail in a little bubble wrapped envelope. Openes it and installed it right away, it's very easy and convenient. I have a MacBook Pro so I needed the adapter too, but it has been working perfectly. Definitely a great buy."
5,Works like a charm,"Can't beat the price on a HDMI cable that is $1.59 & works just fine. Not much to say, but I ordered 2, and they both work like they are supposed to...though I don't move'em around or anything, and it's possible they CAN short out faster than a more heavy duty cable/brand...but, as for now, works great. Even in the worst case, that's not too much of a risk to take at under $2(Plus Shipping if you have to pay for that). Nonetheless, I'm currently definitely satisfied with my purchase(s)of this product."
5,Worked just fine.,"Though these cables are super cheap they work just fine. I use one for connecting my XBOX 360 and the other I use to connect my Bluray/Stereo System.I also use the ARC HDMI on my TV to connect the sound system so that when I use my XBOX the sound gets passed out my TV and into my sound system using the HDMI ARC technology. In other words, these cheapy cables work just fine when using the 2-way ARC technology."
1,Not the product I ordered.,"I ordered this cable because of the great price point but when it arrived it was only 3 feet, not the 6 feet I paid for."
5,Everything in a HDMI cable you would need.,"Simple as this, you order a HDMI cable, you get exactly what you ask for. It's completely compatible with HDMI supported devices, no marks or tears. You get what you paid for."
3,OK,"Low quality cables, but a great price they do the job for small standard Tv's but if you have a large tv with a high hurts rate and you watch a lot of HD and action films it just won't cut it. Get gold inlay with a large a gauge wire."
5,It Works,The cable worked to connect my Windows 7 laptop to an LED television.I used it to watch an episode of The Good Wife we missed.
2,"Worked for a few months, then quit.","I purchased this under the impression that it would work for longer than five months… I understand that there is a correlation between price and longevity, but what I didn't expect was for this lesson to so quickly show itself. My recommendation: spend a few more dollars on a name-brand cord. It's cheaper than the combined cost of this, plus buying a replacement in a few months."
2,Good for a little while...,"It actually still works. The only issue I am having, and its not a big one, just a small pet peve is that when the screen is black, there is a red tint to it. I have only had it for a day or so and only used it for a few hours. It was fine at first. I am sure its the cable as I tried other cables and none of them had the same results. You get what you pay for."
5,Great Deal,"Saved a ton on this HDMI Cable.After reading reviews about the expensive ones and that there is really not a big difference among cables, I got this for my PS3. Everything works great, getting the 1080p to my plasma, and hearing the surround sound just fine..."
1,You get what you pay for.,"These seemed like a great deal--gold connections and all--so I bought two. First one failed within a couple months, second one a few weeks later. Spent more on replacements from Radio Shack, both of which are still working fine. Lesson learned."
5,DVI Gear HDMI Cable (6 Feet),Not A bad Deal for two bucks. Just plugged it in to my laptop and to my HDTV and the picture is perfect.
5,"Amazing quality, especially for the price.","I read reviews that stated this product was a waste of money, to it is exactly what any other HDMI cable is for a fraction of the cost. I use this cord for my monitors through my Toshiba docking station and it is phenomenal the video feed I get out of this. I can't say it's the exact quality of every other one out there, but it definitely works great for me. Gamers, you may want to spend the little bit extra; from that aspect it is about a mid range quality feed. My LED monitors definitely help to enhance the quality."
4,extra cable,"I bought this as a extra cable for my travel kit, I have tried it out and all seems fine, this is not one of the deluxe cables but seems to work just fine delives the same high quality picture and sound.. just a bit less expensive...."
5,Execellent,Product delivered on time and worked as expected. used this cable to connect DVR to TV/Minitor.Also used the second HDMI cable to connect laptop to TV.
5,Great!,"The HDMI cable was cheap and came quickly. Most importantly, it worked. Nothing to stop you from ordering from this seller."
1,It didn't work!!!,"I bought this cable and was hoping to hook my laptop up to my TV... I figured there must be something wrong with either my port on the laptop or TV. I kept the chord and threw away all the packaging, only to find out weeks later, it was actually the cable that didn't work. I have never bought something online that just flat out was broken!! Really frustrating, but it was only $3 so I don't know what I expected.."
4,NICE,"Gets the job done, can't tell the difference of picture quality from my $60 HDMI cable to this one!!! Although the more expensive one feels a lot better but is only 3 feet."
1,6ft. HDMI cord,"Product took very long to receive, I have purchased a lot from online over the years and never had such a long shiping time. Product came intact and well packaged. After installing new HDMI cord I could not get the cable box to work. After having a tech from the cable company come and replace the box he found that it was the cord that did not work. I do not recommend purchasing this item."
5,hdmi cable,it works as expected. does what I thought it would do. it seems to be a quality cable for me.
5,Hdmi cables for a great price and got delivered really fast!!,Product came as advertised and fairly quickly. Satisfied with the purchase and would recommend seller!
5,Don't Let the Price Fool You,"I was very sceptical about getting this hdmi cable. It had a bunch of good reviews, and since it was so cheap I thought what the hell? I am very happy I did. Since then I have bought three more of the exact cables from them, just in case I need them. I use it for my xbox 360, my laptop (which has an hdmi port), and my brand new Samsung LN40a650 1080p. So go ahead and get it, you will be glad you did."
5,Great Quality at a Great Price,"Cable was shipped very fast! Good quality a bit short, but only because i didnt realize i needed a cable longer than six feet. Still work out great thank you very much!"
5,Couldn't be more satisfied,"I was quite skeptical that something that Circuit City wanted around $75 for would even work. But this was the best $3 I have ever spent. If you have a PS3 - you NEED this cable.Not only did I save around $70, but the cable arrived faster than I expected."
5,Great item felt and looked expensive but wasn't,"Item was just what I needed and wanted and may purchase another for another laptop so we can both hookup and possible PS3 purchase that is pending in the future, great price much cheaper than anywhere else I could have gotten it however it doesn't feel inexpensive feels more like something I would have paid alot more for"
4,Great!,Best deal I could find and just as good as the expensive brands. Iwon't look anywhere else in the future.
4,Does what I need it to,"What to say, for a basic chap like me, does what I need it to, HD movies on Blu Ray or indeed from my Micca Media Player to my LG TV - excellent picture and sound transfer."
3,inspire hdmi cables,"the cables were not long enough, they were not 6 feet, they were about 3, but they were cheap so i didn't care soo much"
5,Absolutely Genius for Price,"Amazon popped this up for me to review just now; it's been awhile since I researched HDMI cables, but I notice these are currently listed at 5 cents EACH. I think I paid 98 cents a few months ago.At that time, I spent a couple hundred dollars on a couple cables that I use in my entertainment system, but I also picked up a couple of these cables to use with some portable devices.I honestly cannot tell the difference between my $100 set of cables and these $0.05 cables and they are still working perfectly after quite a beating from travel.I really cannot say how much I wish I had just bought a bunch of these cables, and none of the fancy (expensive) ones."
1,Bad,This item is not good resolution sucks very overly will not recommend any of these to anyone hd cord spend more get a decentv one
1,Can't return,I contacted them to return this product. I purchsed it thinking that I needed it for the backup drive. I don't and now I am stuck with it. I hope they contact me to return it.
2,"Poor Quality, too good to be true!","I would place this in the you get what you pay for Category. There is a reason why HDMI cables are expensive, eventually the price will come down but $3 for a cable is too good to be true. I bought Sony HDMI cables they were $40 for a 6ft cable. worked fine on my PS3 I tried this one. It would not even work. I bought 3 of these and one of them worked, out the package then it died, so none work, sticking with the $40 cables. If you spent $1k+ on a TV and blu-ray or PS3 spend the extra $$$ and get quality cables."
4,Cheapest HDMI,What can I say? Excellent image and sound; it works well and its cheap.I recommend this product.
5,Best For the Price,"After seeing nearly 500 reviews about this i was still a little skeptical. but i needed a hdmi cable to run my Sony upconvert DVP-ns77h. so for just under 5 bucks why not. after connecting it to the player i was shocked on its performance. i compared it to an older Monster cable 800 Ultra series 1.2m and in detail the cheap hdmi cable was better but less vivid in colors to the monster cable, BUT the monster was more ""grainy"" in picture. so overall i liked this cheap cable, and will buy a couple more. i am running this cable to a Sony Bravia SXRD KDS-50A3000. which sony doesnt make anymore. if you were like me and still little skeptical, for 5 bucks +/- still heck of a deal."
5,excellent,"You wont notice the difference with a $60 HDMI and this HDMI. I would recommend this HDMI to everyone. I have a Friend who bought his $60 HDMI from Best buy and the wire is very thick compared to this HDMI, we tested each one out and we couldn't see a difference Buy this one don't waste more money."
1,Beware - these cables may not be compatible w/your HDTV,"After reading all the customer feedback regarding this item, I went ahead and purchased the cables only to discover they are not compatible with my Sharp 32""LCD HDTV. The DVI error states your system does not support HDCP.Beware!"
3,Hdmi cable,"Shipping was a little slower than i would like, and questionable quality of cable...sound keeps goin in and out..never done that before."
2,apparently temperature sensitive,"I purchased these hdmi cables from amazon based on a PC mag review saying ""hey, don't waste your money. Cables are cables are cables."" That's true. These work(ed) just GREATuntil my house got cold. I live in a cabin, actually, with only wood heat. and the night of the election, when I was GLUED to the TV, I lost video/audio at every crucial point. I thought it was weather interference with my dish, but then I discovered that if I changed inputs from hdmi to rca cables, everything was fine. There seems to be a correlation between the temperature of my house and the connection in the cable (my house gets really cold where the TV is, near a window and on an exterior wall).So if you're in SoCal or Florida or Texas or somewhere that doesn't go below 50, buy the cables! If it's colder, HEAT YOUR HOUSE."
2,terrible quality but i guess OK for its price,i bought this cheap cable to replace my rocketfish HDMI cable but i found the quality rather much more poor on my HDTV. so i switched back to rocketfish until i buy the monster 850 or the 1000 series.
1,Great....when it worked,Saw a huge difference when it actually worked. The cable itself is of extremely low quality. I had to stand and wiggle it around for it to work. After the second movie I just chucked it as it was so unpredictable. Perhaps you may have more luck.At this price I couldn't even be bothered to return it.Still worth another shot but beware of the shoddy the quality.Basically with HDMI if it works it works. If it doesn't you don't get a signal. There is no difference between this and a Monster cable.
4,No issues,Purchased this HDMI cable to connect my surround sound system to my TV. So far after 4 years I have had no issues with this cable.
4,Very well written,"Mr. McCune is my 7th grade social studies teacher (and a good one at that!), and I bought this book from him. Now, let me tell you: I normally don't enjoy children's books. But this one is different. It has lot of education about the Egyptions, the Aztecs and Pirates, and also has a tad of excitement and adventure. This book tells us about friendship and the benefits of it. It is very well written and very interesting."
1,NOT recommended,"1. This book has no illustrations of the techniques described; all it has are verbal descriptions of how to form the stitches, etc., and for a craft book, that's an inexcusable oversight. It is very difficult to explain handwork with words, and the author's descriptions are completely insufficient to the task.2. The author has failed to consider her target audience. Though the book is supposedly for beginner to expert levels, the author skips over many explanations needed to make these techniques clear for less experienced stitchers.3. When describing each stitch, the author refers the reader to the photographs of finished pieces--unfortunately the photos are of such poor quality that it's difficult to see any detail, and as the projects have no keys to help you tell which section or line is which, it's often difficult to tell which part of the project the text refers to."
3,BURNING DOWN PARADISE just burns me down,"This disc sees the reuniting of three original key members - MARSH, WIGGINS and BOULTON and the cover looks tempting but that is just about the best of it. I gave this disc 3 stars becuase I am a long time fan of the band since way back when.This disc is just pretty much generic metallic rock with no true UMPH to it, nothing here that really grabs you which is unfortunate because this band was legendary back then.Damn I miss the 80's."
4,Very Funny,"I recently watched this play, I thought it was very good. They didn't over do the singing and there was a good story line. Make you realized that everything that glitters is not gold and what you this is good can be bad; and what we thin is bad can actually be for our good. 3"
3,Okay,The play is modern day love with a twist. It begins slow and picks up toward the end. Even though there are known stars in this it still has places where it lagged and the plot was very easy to figure out. But still worth looking at.
4,Great for the price I paid,"These little sticker books are wonderful! I took my 18 month on a 6 hour plane ride and these kept him entertained for much of the trip. I would have given this 5 stars however it claims that the stickers are reusable and unfortunately this is nowhere near an accurate description. The first time we bought them we left the stickers on the book for a few days and when we took them off, pretty much all of the ""stickiness"" was gone. We liked them so much that we bought more for another trip and tried to take them off immediately after our son was done playing with them. This did help a bit, but in no way would I describe them as reusable! When I purchased several of these they were $1.50 each with a 4 for 3 amazon promotion. I thought this was well worth purchasing them again however I noticed recently that the price has more than doubled!!! I will probably not purchase them again unless the price goes back down or they actually become reusable somehow."
3,It's tiny,I had no idea this was an activity book for ants. I would not have purchased it had I known that.
3,Nothing special,"We got this as a stocking stuffer, so i knew it would be small. It's basically just a few stickers folded over to look like a book. There is an image in the inside cover so you can use it to put stickers on if desired. Wth the low price, but definitely nothing special."
3,"Small, not exactly what I thought","Thought it would be a little bigger and more stickers, but cant complain about the price. My 2 year old was done with this book in about 10 minutes."
2,Wallet-Sized Book!,"This book is so tiny! I knew it would be small from reading the reviews, and I was still surprised when I got it. It's about the size of an iPhone!"
4,Writing Effective Report Card Comments,"Helpful, practical, and time-saving are the three words that best describe this book! I have been teaching first grade for many years and always struggle at report card time to write comments that appropriately describe the academic and social progress of my students each nine weeks. It is easy to write about the high achieving, on grade level student, but comments for discipline problems and those who are falling behind grade level are difficult. This book helps state the problem and gives concrete suggestions that will encourage families in areas of needed improvement. The author gives teachers the tools to communicate effectively!"
2,Other books better,"If you need something really practical, this is not it. Chapters like ""Teachers' Philosophies"" and ""Report Cards in the Assessment Process"" belong in a different, more general book, not one called ""Quick Tips for Writing Effective Report Card Comments."" Give me chapters filled with suggested phrases and wordings. One slim chapter had these. Another book I ordered at the same time did a much better job."
4,A Good Reference,"This book helps teachers who are struggling with the task of what to write on report cards. It lists many suggestions in several different areas. If you're looking for a book with lots of suggestions for what to say on report cards and how to say it, this is a good book to consider."
5,First book I've seen that really presents them clearly ...,"I have struggled with the concept of quaternions for a while. Being involved in the flight simulation industry, I finally found myself needing to know much more about them and understanding them thoroughly. This book presents the subject matter from the start in an easily understandable progression. Various practical examples are also given which make this book the definitive source for quaternion understanding."
5,"Very, very good reference for 3D modelers.",This book is great. The author goes into great depth on Matrices and Quaternions. Topics such as Aerospace sequences and Tracking sequences are covered in clear detail.This book is a must have for anyone taking a Computer Graphics course. If you have ever studied Shoemake's arcball then you will appreaciate the Tracking sequence.It is just too bad other authors don't accumulate this much information and present it in a clear usuable format.I give this book a very high recommendation. You will not find better information than this on quaternion and/or rotation sequences.
5,Step by step,"As an engineer assigned to find a way to use quaternions to solve a real time orientaion tracking problem I found this book more than useful, it has been a complete reference. I recommend this book to anyone who needs to understand and use quaternions now. A practical, clear and thorough presentation, Thank you Dr. Kuipers !"
5,ba na na na,"This was an utterly fabulous book. My friend Marc, the Original Banana Republican, was especially impressed with the bit about gay marriage. I highly recommend this thoroughly investigated masterpiece."
4,Painfully relevant,"This book is, as others have mentioned, a well documented litany of organizations, supporters, schemes, scams, tactics and objectives of the neocon right. Unfortunately, the sheer volume of information presented requires considerable effort to digest. In addition, the book brings to light a large number of very unpleasant facts and exposes many unsavory characters. This is not an enjoyable book but it is an important book and should be required reading for anyone who still believes the Republican Party stands for strong national defense, fiscal conservatism and smaller government."
4,Salutory,"The country has been so bombarded for deacdes by the claim that the media is liberal, readers like the one from Syracuse believe it, ignoring the power, reach and influence of the Wall Street Journal; talk radio, especially Rush Limbaugh; and MSNBC and Fox. Furthermore, the campaign has shifted all media rightward. But even Republicans have admitted the claims of a liberal media are a shell game, and a brilliantly successful one at that. This book and David Brock's The Republican Noise Machine and Eric Alterman's What Liberal Media should be read by all citizens who want to maintain and strengthen American democracy."
5,Points everything out,"Bought this for my father for he is from this region, and he really liked that something of this nature was made. It did not blanket anything, but showed the true reason why corruption has been able to run rampent for so long in areas that are so rich in mineral and people. An essential piece indeed."
3,"Not quite everything, but close","National Skyline's full-length debut puts together all the quintessential elements of post-rock: programmed drum tracks, a Yorke-like lead singer, the floaty guitar riffs angels might play in rock's after-life; certainly not the usual fair you'd expect from Jeff Dimpsey, a former member of Illinois' alterna-metal troupe Hum. While Hum's 'I'd Rather be an Astronaut' is indie rock for intelligent metalheads, 'This=Everything' is the kind of emotionally ambitious album soundtrack producers look for to highlight the crushing solitude of urban sprawl. And clocking in at just under 41 minutes, the road to Skyline's self-discovery is a short one; fortunately, it keeps the music - and the emotion - just a little bit more honest."
5,Good Prchase,Item arrived on perfect condition. Also arrived in a timelymanner. Will use again to purchase books. Thank you!
2,A beach weekend book,"This book seemed like a weak ripoff of the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. The main male character suffers the same horrific attack as one of the Outlander characters, they both share a first name and they both survive. And they both use the British Isles Fairy Stones or Druid Stone formations as their centerpiece and build the plot around them. This book, however, set in the 1200's, seems likely written by a child. The author make reference to plaster on a stone cabin's interior walls, the smell of mown grass and King Arthur as someone's father, even though he would have to be about 600 years old to have accomplished that feat. It's a light fluffy beach read at best."
3,Okay,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I didn't leave as satisfied as I did with other books of hers, but maybe it is just me. It was a nice story, though."
2,Couldn't get into it....,"I hate to go against the grain in a forum of so many positive reviews...But I tried to read ""Wild"" and just couldn't get into it. I guess I'm not a big fan of books with 'psychic healers.' This has been done to death in historical romance, and is an instant 'hook' writers use to make the heroine sympathetic. Wild is no exception. I liked the idea that the heroine was a recluse. But the heroine constantly referring to the hero as ""English"" wore on my nerves.Worse still, the hero Roger was your typical drunken womanizer. <Yawn.> Unfortunately I couldn't muster much interest in finishing this book."
1,too bored to finish,"This book seemed more like a contrived promotional piece for PETA than a romance novel. The heroine was rightfully distrustful of humans because of their poor treatment of her, but we are suppose to think she is clean while she literally sleeps with a pig? The hero whose name I've already forgot because all she does is call him English is one dimensional and an idiot terrified of saying anything against her beliefs lest she get angry. Yes we all know what PETA believes, humans bad, animals good, never mind that the natural world is far more brutal, how many humans easy their young?"
3,After Wonderful - this was a bit of a letdown,"If you can make it through all the typos and poor editing this is an okay story. Not much more, not much less. I was disappointed in the ending - the ""who did it to Roger"" part. Also - after Roger's reputation in Wonderful - he seemed to fall in love with Teleri rather abrubtly. However I liked the development of Teleri's character and her wonderful grandmother. I read the third in the series, Wicked, since I had already bought it - it is leagues better than this 2nd book of the trilogy."
5,Wonderful Story,"I discovered this series by Jill Barnett about a week or so ago and am so sorry I didnt come across it years ago.This is the second book in the series and it is just as great as the first one ""Wonderful"". Ms Barnett paints such a beautiful picture with her words that one can surely imagine the scenery with no problem. The characters are wonderful and full of life. cant wait to start reading book three."
1,What a disappointment!,"I buy quite a few books and CDs and DVDs each year, but this is the first time that I have felt impelled to write a review. Anyone who has seen the excellent series on the Civil War by Ken Burns can't help but gag at this boring work on the First World War. It is nothing but a chronological presentation of the battles, with the same film clips used over and over and over. After seeing the same film clip used for the 6th or 7th time I got pretty tired and even irritated, and had to turn it off from pure boredom. There are countless excellent photographs from that war. Why were they not used rather than re-using the same film clips a dozen times? One wonders what kept the makers of this documentary from using other sources (letters from the soldiers for example) rather than droning on about the rudimentary information on the battles? I am sorry I paid money for these DVDs."
2,Disappointing Treatment of the Great War,"The Great War, The Complete History of World War I, a three-DVD set by Koch Entertainment, is a poor production on the Great War compared to The First World War - The Complete Series (a Major Channel Four series). The main upside is some interesting footage mainly about the Western front. The main downsides of this series lie in the disorganized narration, a lack of context, minimalist maps, and a deeply annoying and repetitive (machine) gun noise effect. To summarize, this series will be at best of interest to viewers who have an advanced knowledge of the main events of WWI to help them better appreciate what Koch Entertainment was trying to accomplish in putting this DVD set together."
1,Major Waste of Time,"I had high hopes ordering The Great War, too bad it's a Great Waste of Time enduring it. Really, all it is is Patrick Boniface sounding like a bad Capt. Kirk reading from what seems like a wikipedia article on WW1. Major ommisions, Eastern Front, Africa, Middle East. COULD NOT STAND STOCK FOOTAGE RERUN RERUN AD NASEUM which had not relationship to narration. Tiny figures running across battlefield in re-enactment and pilots in model ww1 fighters just flying around grew most tiresome. A group of High School kids could do a better job doing a Ken Burns-ish documentary."
1,I gave it away,"Boring reading from even more boring copy...pathetic sound effects of machine guns going on constantly....stock video used over and over again...""wait, is that Verdun...no it's the Marne..uh no wait it's Belle Wood..no it's Verdun again."""
5,A genuine encounter,"I loved the way this video was put together. Having lived on the farm at an earlier time, I was aware of the potential for tension between the family members. Brother and sister did the right thing by meeting face to face. I saw a postive resolution with mutual love and respect. It wasn't an easy achievement but appeared genuine. We don't always understand everything the same but we can still love and appreciate each other. Plus the scenery was great. Overall a very satisfying story."
4,Lesson in bridging the gulf between two siblings' worlds,What happens when one sibling is secular+Jewish+agnostic+bisexual+NYC filmmaker and the other is born-again+Christian+straight+farmer in a remote Christian commune in Alaska? That's what this documentary is about -- how to make bridges between loved ones who have diametrically opposed worldviews. The good news is that there *is* common ground from which to sustain relationship and that each sibling is able to offer the other a gentle lesson in how the other half lives.
5,Very good camera bag,"This bag is well designed and has good quality of material. Perfect fit for my Panasonic FZ28. Note: For medium-sized camera like my FZ28, you need to take out the bottom pad to have the camera fit in side way, so you can take the camera out or put it in easily and safe. In addition, with the adjustable devider, I can have the charger fit in the main compartment too with some room left. There are top and side pockets for spare batteries, memory cards, and other accessories. The whole thing is still compact. It's not fair that some people rated this bag low because it doesn't fit their devices; pick the right size bag then go from there. I bought my bag for $15.69 (cheapest I guess). Highly recommended!"
4,Excellent Quality....Read Dimensions Before Purchase,"The quality of this bag is excellent, just be certain to check out the dimensions of your camera. My Canon DVD camcorder would not fit in this bag, with the few accessories I need, for a digital photo camera it may be fine, just a heads up on checking dimensions.Jeff"
3,An Okay Bag,"I picked this bag because it measured 7 inches long (in the product listing). My Canon XA10 camcorder just barely fits inside. The additional side pouches holds the XA10's battery, USB cable, audio/video cables, and the A/C power adapter. I wish they could have made this bag just a little bit bigger! Just by one more inch longer and wider, and 3 inches taller. This bag is better suited for cameras, NOT camcorders!"
3,Barely fit,The Panasonic DV GS320 barely fit into this bag. Look for the next size up to fit your cam comfortably. There is no room for the charger cable or even a shoulder strap.
5,Bear Necessities,"It's a cool, compact camera bag with little compartments that fit the essentials (i.e. batteries, memory cards, adapters, chargers, etc.) Lightweight makes it a plus. Able to fit the Nikon P510 in it perfectly. Good stuff."
5,GREAT BAG FOR THE PRICE!!!,"I purchased the Lowepro Edit 110 Camcorder Bag last month (April 2011). I needed a little bag to carry my digital Panasonic SDR-S26 Camcorder around. The bag was everything they said it was. It is small enough to carry everywhere and roomy enough to fit my camcorder, extra batteries, charger, cables and additional SDHC cards. My bag arrived so fast that I didn't even had a chance to track my order. I was expecting delivery date to be between 5 to 6 business days and in 2 days the USPS was ringing my doorbell and to my surprise it was my order. Amazon.com is fast, accurate and has the lowest prices on the Internet! I will be doing more shopping with them soon! I highly recommend the Lowepro Edit 110 Camcorder Bag to anyone who is looking for a decent camcorder bag at a great value. It's truly a great bag for the price (less that $15.00). Order it!"
3,Bag is too small,The bag will hold my JVC Everio GZ-HD10 and an extended battery pack and that is it. The side pockets are small and there is no extra room to hold an extra battery or attachments.
2,Tight Fit for Panasonic SDR-18 and accessories,"This bag will hold a Panasonic SDR-18(Or similar sized camera)with 1 battery in the main compartment but nothing else.But if you want to bring along the USB cable and the charging kit which is two power cables and the base plus a spare battery you will be hard pressed to find room for everything. You will not have room for the manual. The only way I made everything fit was to store the USB cable at one end pocket, the DC power cord in the other end pocket and camera and charger w/AC cord together in the main compartment. This created a very tight fit and every time I wanted to get the camera from the bag I had to remove the charger first which is good way of leaving something like that behind in a busy or crowded room.The bag is made fine and seems very durable. Good storage for small items such as memory cards."
3,Warning to Camcorder Owners seeking bag!!!,"This is really small... Very good for a camera for digital pictures, but not a camcorder bag, I should of listened to the other reviews stating it was too small, it is tiny! It is a great bag though, very durable, just too tiny for a camcorder like the Cannon HV30."
2,good quality but way too small even for the little Canon HF200,very but very small even for the tiny Canon HF200there is no space for nothingyou expected you would have space at list for the charger & extra batteryif you consider buying this bag for your camcorder look for bigger modle
2,"Decent for storing/protecting camera, not much else.","This would be a nice camera bag if you are looking for something compact and are not interested in carrying accessories. However, you should really know the side pockets are horrendous for storing camera accessories. They are just too small and poorly designed. It's a struggle to fit in a charger and a few spare tapes. If you had other things like a car charger, spare batteries, firewire cable, you would need another bag for that stuff. As it is, just carrying the charger and a few tapes in it, the pockets bulge and the velcro seems to hold only precariously.I am keeping it only because it is inexpensive and it does the important thing, it keeps my camera in a safe place. But I really wanted a bag that would let me store a few miniDV tapes, spare batteries and chargers along with the camera. This bag is incapable of living up to that task."
5,Lowerpro es igual a calidad!!!,"Extrema calidad la que posee este bolso, con un acabado en todos sus aspectos muy cuidado, realmente es una gran compra mas por su atractivo precio que no es señal de baja calidad para nada sino todo lo contrario me encuentro con un bolso fabricados con unos materiales de lujo y que solo a verlo y sentirlo te da la seguridad de que tu equipo estará muy bien protegido hasta de caídas!Lo he comprado para la Canon HG10 y le queda de maravilla! no puede acertar mejor!Si planeas llevar solo el equipo sea cámara o filmadora es perfecto, si planeas o piensas llevar el equipo más algunos accesorios escoge otro bolso, para mi usos es perfecto solo la filmadora.Es compacto! fenomenal...Muy recomendable, es una compra excelente..."
1,Not for the Panasonic HD40,I purchased this bag as a package with the Panasonis HD40 camcorder but it was too big so I returned it. If it has been the correct size it would have been nice as the protection seemed very good as did the little pockets to store extra items .
3,"quality, but small","As are all lowepro products that i have purchased in the past this is a high quality product for a great price. My only reservation is it's size. I purchased this bag for what I considered a rather small digital video recorder. The recorder fits nicely in the bag, but there is litte room for accessories like cables and battery recharger. My recommendation is to think about what you intend to put in the bag before you purchase."
3,ok,"I liked it cuz its small and good for carring around. It fits my ZR850 + extra DVs. However, nothing else. Try to put in the charger too. But, unless I put it on top of the camera, it does not fit anywhere else. Quality of product is good."
5,Camcorder bag,"Thought might be too big, but was perfect to hold my camcorder, canon digital camera, extra batteries for each and my cables. Good quality product and a great price."
4,Just big enough!,"Nice little bag.It fits my JVC everio videocam with the power adapter and my little canon elph with its power adapter. No room left for the videocam's remote, manuals and misc cables.Good little bag.I would have liked it a weeeee bit bigger so I could fit the extra junkbut otherwise a very good little bag (at a good price)."
4,Good Bag for Canon Vixia HF S21,"I bought this bag for my Canon Vixia HF S21 camcorder. Although it's a snug fit, the main compartment is just large enough store the camcorder; the main compartment is also very well padded, so it definitely feels safe to store my camcorder in this bag. The bag doesn't have much additional room to store larger accessories such as a battery charger. However, it's fine for storing my power cord, usb cord, spare battery, remote control, and spare SD card. The bag is also an excellent overall value for the price."
5,Great Bag for my new HD Camcorder.,"This was a gift a relative purchased to go with myToshiba Camileo X100 Full-HD Camcorder - Silver/Black. It fits great with some room left for the devider and about an inch to spare for something small like 3 spare batteries I also received to go in the main compartment.Lowepro makes some quality stuff and this appears to be very well made for such a small price.Zippers, material, padding, velcro, stitching all appear to be well done.For a small video camera bag, this appears to be quite a deal!I like that there is also a belt loop on the back!"
4,"Good case, but sometimes a little hard to get into...","I bought this camcorder case as part of an Amazon package. It holds my JVC Everio with the largest batter just fine, plus I can fit the original battery and a tripod mount in there as well. If I had any memory cards, those wouldn't be a problem to put in the case either. The only gripe I have with the case is that it can be hard to get into when you need to get into it quickly (which may be a good thing for deterring pocket theft). In order to get into the main pocket, you have both pull apart the velcro and unzip the entire top of the case -- not really that big a deal, but it can take a little longer than expected. Other than that, the case is good!"
5,Great bag,"Very nice bag and well made.However, I bought it for the Canon DC100 DVD camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment (cords and charger)."
5,Perfect bag for the Canon VIXIA HF M500 and accessories,This bag was the perfect fit for the Canon VIXIA HF M500. The camcorder fits perfectly in the main compartment. The charger fits in the front compartment. One side pocket is for the USB cord and the other side pocket contains a spare battery. A spare card and the HDMI cable fit in the inside pocket. Everything fits nicly and the camcorder is well protected. The main compartment closes with both a zipper and velcro flap. The front pocket uses a zipper and the side pockets close with velcro.The bag itself seems sturdy and has plenty of padding. The external pockets on three sides add to the protection for the main compartment. Overall I think this is about the smallest case available where I was able to fit the camcorder and all the accessories. I will say that this bag is definately full with the accessories I've listed so adding anything additional (like a mike or light) would have been a tight fit.
5,AWSOME bag!!,"TheLowepro Edit 110 Camcorder Bagis a very good camera/camcorder bag. Great for a mega-zoom camera or camcorder. Extrmely good for the price, with good looks, LOTS of pockets( 2 on sides, 1 on front, 1 on flap) and is durable. Would recconmend to any one."
3,Wife's camera bag,I picked this camera bag because it was not a real big one. It just fit my new fuji camera. Like the compartments to put things in and the handle. Sometimes I wish that camera bags would come in a different color then just black. Its a very new camera bag so I really don't know how it will hold up over a long period of time.
4,"I Like It, But I Wish It Were Bigger","My Hitachi camcorder fits just fine, but there's no room for the AC adaptor, so I wind up putting my camcorder in this bag, and then putting the camcorder bag in a totebag so I can take the other stuff along with me. It's got lots of good padding though, and the pockets are handy. It's a snug fit for the camcorder, but I think that probably makes it protect a little better, since there's no room for the camcorder to rattle around in the bag."
4,Not the end all....smallish,"The bag is ok for your modern-day digital camcorder (Panasonic GS300), but it is a ""Very Tight"" fit should you wish to also add a small digital camera like a Canon 520. The best fit is to lay the camera on the bottom, place the padded divider over it and then lay the camcorder on top. The zipper slightly pulls the top & bottom together with this configuration. Go elsewhere if you need a bag to hold both a camcorder & camera; otherwise, it's a good product with nice features. BTW, the bag is amply padded."
3,Femme- Goth Metal from Hungary,"This is a fairly heavy yet melodic album featuring a lady singer named Kyrah who's singing seems to be in the background as much as up front and I find to be a little irritating. I guess it's supposed the sound more atmospheric that way.All in all, the music is fairly dark and the guitars are heavy as I mentioned. The album is only seven songs totaling a paultry thirty-eight minutes.There are a some good hooks and some of my friends think highly of Storm Before Silence and there's nothing wrong with the album but for my money I'll take other FemmeGoth bands like Lacuna Coil, Artrosis and Dreams of Sanity to name a few. Final rating 3.5 stars"
2,Don't buy any that's not Sony,"When I purchased my Sony Cybershot camera I researched which storage device to buy for a while. I saw a lot of bad comments for the Scan Disk drive because Sony cameras would sometimes not recognize it and then the purchase it's lost. I decided to get this one because I hadn't heard of anyone having this problem with the Lexar. Well there's a first time for everything. My lexar memory stick worked fine for a few months (the only reason why I am rating it as a 2 and not a 1) but now the camera won't recognize it and I have to get a new one. I have friends who are techies and most of them have adviced me that for Sony cameras, you should really get a Sony memory stick."
4,me,"This product was great for cleaning up my dogs teeth and made their breath smell great. My one concern is one of my dogs is a chewer and he chews off the strings and swallows them. So as much as my dog loves to play with it too, I have taken it away until his breath and teeth get bad again."
2,Big fail,The rope came in the mail and my 1 dog tore into it and shredded it in no time at all the ropes from petco are much better they last much longer
3,Lasted two days,The family's 4 year old chocolate lab loved this toy for about a day and a half. By then she had it torn apart and in pieces all over the floor. She ways about 75 pounds and is pretty docile. Great toy but don't expect it to last long.
5,Great quality and durability,When I bought this rope I was worried that my Great Dane and English Mastiff would have it in shreds in the first week. Well.... this is 2 months later and the rope is still intact. I definately recommend this product.
2,Feigning grit,"When first gaining prominence as a solo artist, perhaps too many of us fell for something that was not entirely there. I know those are often my thoughts when sifting through the inordinate back catalog I invested into this rather manipulative, lazy artist. It is completely apparent on EP's like these that the songwriting is obnoxiously dull and simply disguised with consciously frazzled vocals and apparent production authenticity in order to mask the uninspired mediocrity of it all."
5,The Legitimate Pro Football Experience!,"This large and heavy book chronicles the roots of Pro Football. It is a raw and up close look at the real gritty players back in the day with excellent photography and commentary. ""The Pro Football Experience is the most spectacular book ever published about professional football - perhaps about any sport anywhere"".Enjoy the roots of the game! Excellent Football Book Never to be Equaled! Contents: I. The Lure of the game. II. Heritage. III. Prelude. IV. Attack. V. Interlude. VI. Defend. VII. The Price. VIII. Refuge. IX. Victory..Up close intense photography of the men who defined the game in the early 70's: Bubba Smith; Ray Nitschke; Terry Bradshaw; Dick Butkis and many more players who made the game what it is today."
1,"""Hard"" to use","I have never purchased pure shea butter before, so it may be my naivete that created my disappointment, BUT I was very unhappy to discover the texture of the product is like candle wax or hardened lip balm. It's really hard to get out and even harder to spread over my skin. Plus, once I'm successful in actually getting some of the ""hard"" stuff on my hands for distribution it greases up and takes several minutes to soak in. I would NEVER buy this product again."
4,Gorgeous,I saw the little size in a shop on the San Francisco pier (for double the price) and wanted to purchase them for my brother and sis in law. They're so unique and a work of art. I'm so glad I found them here and hope they love them otherwise I'll keep them for myself. The colors are beautiful but they're not bright. It's colorful yet sophisticated. If you want color but in a more subdued way this is the piece for you.
2,Not As Pictured,"Units are being returned because what was delivered is not as pictured online. Actual colors are not as vivid and, while the finish on the salt shaker was acceptable, the finish on the pepper mill was rough and unacceptable."
4,Beautiful and Classy look,"I love the look of this product. My pepper mill came with a few small chips so is not as smooth as it looks, but not enough to make me return it. My husband liked it so much he bought another set!"
3,Good introduction,"They touch on a lot of recent work on social movements, and are good with many new concepts. But the book is not well written enough for undergrads."
1,useless,"This cutting board falls into the sink very easily, making it only suitable as a decorator item. I am very disappointed with it. I much prefer an over-the-sink cutting board I purchased from The Container Store, even though it's white plastic board is not pretty to look at."
4,Nice looking but not rugged,"A nice looking product,great for cutting soft foods like bananas but for serious kitchen use this board falls short- it's prone to slipping down under heavier use."
4,Highly efficant,"I bought this item as a gift, so I havent used it, But it appears very efficant & handy."
2,Might be good but...,"Might be good but, they contain wheat(probably GMO.) The discription has a lot of things that it DOESN't have in it, but doesn't say it has wheat in it until you get the bottle. My wife is allergic to wheat. So, if you have a wheat allergy beware! Cancelling my subscription."
3,Meh.,"From and Feminist Economist, this book was just okay. I did not enjoy how they tried to portray Marx and Engels as heroes of Women's Liberation. I've studied Marx, and that couldn't be more of a lie. I don't subscribe to the radical feminist idea that women's oppression originated in ""sex"" either, though. But Islam and Women was a good section. I did enjoy the footnotes and empiricism. It was good for the price I got it -- free."
3,Size makes this book handy.,"This books size makes it convenient to carry around to garage sales or toy shows. But the content could be better, some dolls are depicted with inaccurate prices and some vintage doll's aren't pictured in their proper outfits with proper accessories. So this can become confusing for the beginner collector. However there are ""warnings"" listed with some vintage outfits stating that Mattel has made a reproduction (these are worth far less) of it. This is a great feature if you are not a Barbie expert.A good book for the beginner, but I recommend using this guide along with a larger more detailed Barbie book."
5,Great Camera!!,"I have wanted a digital camera for a while now, and I have been looking for the perfect one. I have an SLR camera, but sometimes I just dont feel like carrying around the extra bulk. I am the type of person that travels a lot, and I love to take pictures. The Pentax 33L Optio Camera is a GREAT digital camera. The quality of the pictures is amazing. The zoom is unbelievable, and the features are awesome! I love the camera, and I do not regret buying it. I would HIGHLY Reccomend this product!"
4,Historical Information Only,"This book is a great book to see how the US-China business relationship began. It is very dated, as the the mentality of both US businessmen and Chinese businessmen (and culture) have gone through tremendous changes. I enjoyed the book in the early 90's (and at that time it was even getting dated), and since then have been amazed to see how quick the Chinese have evolved in this relationship, and how the US seems content to remain a step behind. I do highly recommend it to those who are currently doing business with China to understand the early difficulties of US-China business. But it is also very important to understand that the business environment of today does not at all resemble the environment that is written in this book."
3,A book worth reading but...,"While the book has provided plenty factual information on China, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of the thinking of Chinese people and rationale behind their behaviours. One thing that is particularly uneasy for me, as a Hong Kong Chinese, is the sceptical view of the writer on the Chinese people and the country. I would say that the book is good for foreigners who know little about the development of China in the 80's and want to take a break to read some interesting stories, rather than those who really want to explore the current business environment in China."
3,Not their best,"Released in 1989, No Remorse was the fifth album from the British hard rock band Tokyo Blade. I hate to say it, but as much as I enjoyed the NWOBHM veterans' earlier works, this is definitely not the band's best work. No Remorse sounds like a halfhearted cross between Ozzy Osbourne and TNT. There are a couple of straightforward metal tracks (""Shadows of Insanity,"" ""The Eye of the Storm""), a sappy ballad or two (""Call Me Angel,"" ""Chains of Love""), and a few that go for the L.A. sleaze rock sound (""5-Inch Catwalk,"" ""Fever""). The result is a completely adequate, yet completely forgettable hard rock album from a band that was capable of much more. This is just like what Shy released with theirMisspent Youthalbum.While I'd absolutely encourage fans of classic heavy metal and the NWOBHM scene in particular to check out Tokyo Blade, I definitely wouldn't recommend starting here. Unless you're trying to complete a Tokyo Blade collection, you may want to skip No Remorse."
1,Another cheap chinese tool poorly made from soft steel,"I should have read the reviews, before I bought these.My complaints are the same as the others.The tap handles do not stay together or hold the taps, and the case is a mess.But most importantly the taps themselves will not cut standard grade steel.While trying to cut threads into standard grade steel with a 5/16 tap, all it could do was get started and wear out after going in about one turn.To get the job done I bought another new tap at a local store, and it worked just as expected.If you are buying any machine quality tools, try to avoid anything made in China."
1,JUNK,"Terrible quality,It was supposed to be in a plastic organizer, which was broken, and all the parts were all over the place, packaging sucked - AND I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN REFUNDED."
3,It left me empty and perplexed,"This book is in many ways an allegory more than a novel. I felt the characters were disjointed and the various sub-plots, while woven into eachother through Eva Cavell, the protagonist, were too amorphous to tell a story. It was apparent the author was trying not to be judgmental - that is fine and appropriate for a novel of a very complex area. But I want to know more about the characters. I simply could not understand what made Eva ""click"". She was intended as a woman of mystery, but her character needed to be more fleshed out. The writing itself was good - descriptive and evocative."
5,The PJ's,"I remember rushing home to watch Eddie Murphy's latest comedy creation, the PJ's. Low rent, high rise! The story lines and animations make this absolutely hilarious! I recommend watching these DVDs to everyone who loves to laugh!"
4,The PJs Season 3 - Final Season,"Eddie Murphy stars as Thurgood Stubbs in this Primetime Emmy-winning stop-motion comedy series. Thurgood is the chief superintendent in the housing project where he lives with his wife Muriel (Loretta Devine). Follow the adventures of the Stubbs family and other tenants of the Hilton-Jacobs community as they find themselves in and out of trouble in Season 3 of ""The PJs.""Disc 11. Boyz Under the Hood2.

Let's Get Ready to Rumba10. A Race To His Credit11. Clip Show12. Red Man's Burden"
3,Good but uneven,"This is a collection of interviews done with famous sound designers and engineers for a magazine. Which is entertaining and can be quite informative. Be warned that there is no hands-on information and no clear tips and tricks. It reads more like a long magazine and some of the interviews are very hollow and uninformative. Others, however pack some interesting historical and/or amusing information and sometimes even useful tips. Ex: water and voice are roughly on the same frequency range making it difficult to mix dialogue and water in a movie - interesting, huh? At least I thought so...If you are looking for a book to explain to you how to create sounds for film, this is not it. If you are a sound designer and are interested in reading what other sound designers are doing and have done, this can be useful and/or entertaining. But not all chapters."
2,Quite a disappointment,"The author severely restricts his text to Holmes films we can actually see, which I suppose is all right, but it pales alongside Alan Barnes' Sherlock Holmes on Screen and Michael Pointer's The Public Life of Sherlock Holmes. Those books are much broader, providing chronological listings comments of ALL Holmes films. Both have manages to suss out some information on even the rarest of the silents, and of course, Barne's book is much more up to date,making it up to the Cumberbatch TV series. (Can you believe there have been at least four Holmes SINCE this recent show: Jonny Lee Miller (Elementary), Gary Piquer (Holmes & Watson: Madrid Days); Igor Petrenko in a new Russian Sherlock series and a fellow named Costas in Sherlock Holmes versus Frankenstein; and let's not forget the three cheapy knock offs made in the wake of the success of the first Downey picture: Ben Syder, Kevin Glazer and Anthony D. P. Mann.)At any rate, Steibrenner's book is quite a letdown."
2,I Bought 4... then stopped replacing them.,I really wanted to like the Liquid Caddy. I was so excited to get them. I bought two for me and a few weeks later bought them for my mom and dad. Mine broke in the same spot all the other reviewers have already mentioned. Customer service was great and replaced them for free. Those two broke as well. Then the two I gave as gifts broke a couple months later. If you are keeping track... that's a total of six. I have no problem with this company and I think their product could be great. I would love to buy more if they get the flaw fixed. It's a great and very useful idea. Let me know Liquid Caddy.
3,Motorcycle Drink Holder,"This is a great product. Holds various size bottles and cans and keeps them in place. Extends for long and collapses for short. Has flexible straps to hold tight. Only problem is if you go over a bump even a small bump with a full or close to full bottle it jumps and breaks the cup holder off the mount. Then you have a broken cup holder and a bottle skipping down the road on their own. If this happens, check with the manufacturer to see if they will send you a new one."
3,"Great product, except for one thing...","There's only one thing that I would change about this product... They should've made the holder wide enough to hold a coozie in it. Other than that, this is a really cool beverage holder."
3,Not bad at all.,"A government assassin develops the most deadly weapon of all...a conscience.A government assassin (Kristy Swanson) refuses to kill a reporter (David Dukes) and instead teams up with him to break the story of corruption in her agency, all the while being hunted by her ex-superior (Michael Madsen) and protected by her good natured ""gadget man"" (Donald Faison).This is an above average TV movie that's simply fun to watch.Be on the lookout for Ron Perlman as ""the-iceman-cometh"" bad guy looking through the world with rose colored glasses."
3,"Not bad, but rather Deja Vu.","This is really a shame. Supreme Sanction is a fast-moving, enjoyable action thriller, but so much of it has been copied from other movies. The 'assassin refuses to shoot and becomes a target himself' theme is straight out of Replacement Killers. The 'Government agency fakes terrorist attack to get more funding' comes out of Long Kiss Goodnight' and the helicopter stunts that open the movie are the same footage I saw in Firebirds. This said, Supreme Sanction is a well acted movie with a good script. Madsen an Swanson do an interesting 'good killer/bad killer routine' and the score and effects were quite decent. A pity they could not get a more original story."
4,A good book for starting out in computational Physics,"I went thru this book when I first received it, but recently used it as a reference for a computational Physics course I took. I am glad I had it. The only reason for the 4 stars, is no solutions to the problems at the ends of the chapters. I am a firm believer in learning by doing, and this book, although it has some good examples, needs to add answers to the problems, for immediate feedback. Otherwise, it is a good first introduction, and provides an excellent reference."
2,slow,"delivered as described. This seller was quick to ship the product was in great condition when it arrived. Will definitely be back to buy more. Thank you"""
4,Behind the Walls of a Women's Prison,"I enjoyed reading Back in the Daze. This book deals with a number of issues that's relevant to today's society as well as street life, ie. drug use,crime and the consequences of making the wrong choices.The chapter that explains what happens in a women's prison isvery revealing. Life for those girls is no joke, but they seem to make the best of it. This street tale is full of characters that are well written. Some of the characters are humourous, some dangerous, and others are people that I wouldn't want to meet in a dark allyway. The main character, Shy Scotch should be played by Halle Berry. This book should be made into a movie someday. I would love to see Halle Berry doing some of the prison scenes. It would challenge her skills and show a different side to her. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys real life dramas."
4,Deals with a serious subject in an entertaining way.,Back in the Daze is an entertaining book that deals with drug addiction. I recommend this book to anyone dealing with a drug addiction.
1,No information on how?,"I read this book in hope of finding a process by which to follow in order to conduct a benchmarking study. However, I was dissapointed to find out only information and no real process or flow describing how to conduct a benchmarking study."
5,A Must Have!,"If you like Martha Munizzi (her twin sis), then you'll love her.She has an awesome and anointed voice. Isreal Houghton also appears on the CD and sounds good. If you want to praise and worship God, this is the CD to have!"
2,Stapler quit halfway through first job.,"I purchased this stapler to install radiant floor tubing in my house. During use, I frequently had to stop & tighten the screws that were holding the frame together and halfway through the job (~600 staples) it simply stopped firing staples."
2,Extremely big!,"The extra large size is very difficult to handle... by no means you could carry this with you as it looks in the picture, because it's almost as big as a door... I bought this for my rottweiler, but we both fit inside it and still have space left. It would be impossible to take your dog inside this camper in the back of your car, because it's unbelievably big.Besides, I was charged a lot in taxes at the customs in my country, and I was making a fight because it was a dog accesory and it was like a backpack, only a little bigger... my God when I saw the box!! The customs agent must have thought I didn't knew what I was talking about.I am referring specifically to the size extra large... probably in smaller sizes it works much better."
4,Great First Helicopter,"I bought this toy and was flying alone in two hoursit is a great first heli and very easy to set up.BUT here is always a BUT... read the manual completelyas proper setting is a must for easy flying.ALSO A CAVEAT the AMAZON page says it is beter to buy the BCPcrash kit, I did so and IT IS A MISTAKETHIS KIT IS NOT FOR THIS HELICOPTER:Other than that I greatly recomend it"
2,Dissapointing.,"The helicopter is average even for the affordable price. However the charging system design is very poor. After just two charges, the charger never recognized the battery again. The indicator light showed no battery connected. We didn't bother contacting the mfg we just put it in the closet and wrote it off as a cheap product.Also, it was too cheap looking to put on a shelf as a model."
1,Zipper is too much of a challenge,Overall the pack is quite nice except for one problem. There are two zippers. The second is a waterproof TIZIP which only works if greased up before every single use. Not the dependable bag I expected for the price. And the special lube they sent is already gone after only a few outings. My kayak dry suit zippers always work under much more challenging circumstances. Not ready for prime time.
3,Could be better,"Big......This thing is large.I bought it for a wet vacation, but it was too large and heavy, so I have actually never used it. I used my old camera bag and a dry bag.I wish had had bought the rover, which is smaller, but almost the same price.The build quality seems great, but at 6'5"", it is built for someone a couple inches shorter."
2,So annoying I took it back and got a refund.,"I found the ""humor"" in this book so annoying that in the end I took the book back to the store I bought it from, got a refund, and ordered a Sybex title from Amazon instead. Also considering that most people who buy this title probably do so to study for their CNE, it might be an idea to organize it by exam subject matter rather than just jumble it all together."
2,Too much filler. Inadequate content.,"The book contains far too much filler. Much of the humor is juvenile at best. Worse, the book fails to cover in sufficient depth information necessary to pass some of the CNE tests. As one of the most expensive books of its kind, I would expect better from Novell Press."
1,Great book if all you want is bizarre humor,Too much cute humor. The book could have been half as thick if the poor attempts at humor were edited out.
2,Stoner rock allright,"These frazzled acoustic and electric distortions only work when concentrating on instrumental reverb pile-up. Most of the time, horrible vocal-guided vacant repetitions and weak strum patterns guide this boring process instead."
2,"Too much commentary, too little original material","Too much commentary, too little original materialToo much commentary, too little original materialToo much commentary, too little original material"
1,TERRIBLE!,"I don't think any one in the US would want to use these scripts! I have never heard a hypnotherapist use scripts, techniques or language that was anything like this. I returned this book within minutes of receiving it. The scripts were quite lengthy, and a lot of them were metaphors told in a long, biased story. I would quote parts of it for you, but I already packed it up to send back. This is the first time I have ever returned a book!"
1,Pat from Marlboro recommends this book,This is a very special book about the profound love between a mother and daughter. it is a book that expresses the faith in God which allows a person to move through the grieving process to the realization that God does answer our prayers in a timely fashion. Faith is an intense healer.
2,Experimentalists Hardly Hold My Intrest,"Took a look at this album at a mates house after I read a review of the newest album coming out. The music itself is weaved poorly. There was a quote from Q that stated that their music was watery. Aptly stated in my opinion as their sounds were very watered down. Its like listening to your mate blather on after having one to many in the pub. At first you think its entertaining, your even having a laugh and then as it goes on youre looking for a way out. One redeeming quality is this, Trish Keenan has a great voice. It is both haunting and ethereal. This album is a great example as to why sampling isnt always the way to go when making a full length CD."
2,Just buy Stereolab,"OK-Well i gave this cd a try, wrong move. If you want this kinda of sound, just buy Stereoloab, it's the real thing. Broadcast throws too much weird keyboard sounds that really don't sound anything but out of place. The atempt is ok, but the full spectrum is not great. ""The Book Lovers"" is a good tune, it's about the only song you can really absorb, the others are quite empty and a poor atempt to sound ""spacey"". I would'nt buy anthing else from this band. Nice try guys, but no cig."
2,Portishead...NOT!,"This is what happens when a band foregoes any attempt at originality and blatently copies the style of another band. This band attempted to copy the Portishead sound right down to the low-fi record-scratch production, but the songs are weak as is the singer's voice. I do hear some Stereolab influence also, but Broadcast pales in comparison. Go buy Portishead's ""Dummy"" or Stereolab's ""Mars Audiac Quintet"" instead, It'll be much more satisfying."
3,WWE TLC,"Wrestling-wise,it was good but story-wise,not so great.The best matches on the card were the Intercontinetal,ECW and the Tag Team championship matches despite the fact that Big Show was in that match.The wrestling and the storytelling in the World's and WWE championship matches were weak due mainly to the gimmick stipulations.The shock endings and title changes were the highlight of the card,story-wise.I give this event a 7 out of 10."
3,One Of The Better Episodes,"As a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica, I prefer ""Baltar's Escape"" to many of the other episodes. This story about terrorists and hostages is more suitable to what the show was all about. Baltar makes an effective villain and the Nomen and Enforcers are great at his side. The ending is both unpredictable and funny. Not the best episode, but better than most."
4,Baltar Flies Out The Cuckoos Nest,"Baltar busts out of the prison ship with a little help from his friends. Lorne Greene's character gets hassled by the civilian government who want to make nice with the bad guys. This episode is wonderfully acted by John Colicos, who plays Baltar as so mean and oily, its a pleasure to watch the bad guy make our heroes lives unpleasant! This is well-paced adventure that the whole family can watch and enjoy...its not a heavy effects episode, but with the story going from plot twists to jokes to action and back again, you wont mind!"
3,too centered on racial issues,I would have preferred more video/music clips and history rather than focussing on the race thing. Leave that for a political documentary
5,"An exciting story, told really well","I am a big Stax-fan, but I was unprepared for how exciting and interesting the story of Stax Records is. And this documentary tells it extremely well."
4,works very well for the price,"Needed to measure bore taper in a cylinder block. With a little patience this got the job done. Probes slide easily and lock securely. You need calipers to measure the distance across probe. A little tricky to get perpendicular to the bore but that's the nature of this style of tool. This style isn't as easy to use as one with a gauge incorporated but those cost much, much more. Definitely can't beat it for the price."
4,Inside bore Gages,"It will do the job intended. They are a little flimsy, but for non professional use they will work fine.I wouldnt want to build a precission item using themUsed them to check inside bore size on an engine rebuild"
3,T bore gauge,They work but you have to have a delicate touch. Not the smoothest movement. Take a couple extra reading to be sure you got it right or drop the money for a good set. Not Chinese.
1,Total junk,"They dont telescope easily, bore is very rough. One of mine fell apart and springs flew all over the place. Returned for refund. Get what you pay for."
1,Bad language description,"The purpose of simplification leads to incorrect explanationsin the subjects related with the language itself.Chapters 6 and 8 have statements that a C (or javaScript orActionScript) programmer consider confused (variable types,expresions, etc) others are amazing (ex. page 107 : k=k++)and other false (ex. page 104 :explanation about postincrement in loops).Programming concepts should be correctness handle, evenfor designers."
1,Waste of time,I totally agree with Daniel and Miguel. You learn pratically nothing with this book. You only be more confused.
1,The programmer of this thing should be fired,"As an original beta tester of Microsoft XP and a software developer, if I dared release a piece of software as pathethically buggy and unusable on XP as this garbage is, I should be shot! I repeat what the prior reviewer said...the manufacturer does NOT support the product...oh, and by the way, if you check out their so-called support site on the web, you will find there and only there that it doesn't run on laptops either.STAY AWAY FROM THIS OR ANYTHING BY SO DISREPUTABLE A COMPANY"
1,Very disapointing,"My twins received this as a Christmas gift, and I just got around to downloading it. The ""Baby"" CD seemed to work ok, but the Elmo CD's have no sound other that the theme song. I even uninstalled it and installed again using the compatability wizard, thinking the XP was a problem. Still didn't work. I had read the other customer reviews on Amazon after we got the programs, and I hoped we wouldn't have the same problems. The technical support site from the company is ridiculous!! They list off articles to read to fix the program, that are not even understandable. Seems to me if you have to write articles explaining the problems, then the programs are NO GOOD!!!! I would tell all parents not to buy this product."
2,Would not recommend this for use with modern systems,"This software was given to us when our son was just born and I recently broke it out to play with since Sesame Street and Elmo have become a big hit with him. The game itself does appear to work, however the lack of audio during the introductory parts of the game was very disappointing. Even after running the game in the recommended compatibility mode it still failed to work properly. After looking at the [...] website I learned that the sound doesn't work on XP systems with service pack 1 or later on them. So, if I still ran windows 98 or windows Me on an older system this might be ok. Unfortunetly I've moved beyond the 90s in software technology. If you're looking for edu-tainment software for your children I do not recommend this product."
3,Not for Windows XP,I gave the product a neutral review because I haven't been able to play it. When I bought it the info said it was for Windows XP. When I tried to install it it then told me it was made prior to Windows XP and that I had to change some settings on my computer in order to play it. I followed the instructions. I still have not gotten it to play.
3,Used for essays in comparative literature,"I have found Olderr's book of great help in writing essays at the university. If you don't come up with a good interpretation of some object that is used, this book may help to provide you with some alternatives. Great to have on the bookshelf, for when you get stuck."
2,Dreadful. Blase Characterization. Horrible Plot.,"The only good parts of this book are the thoughtful reflections of its young black boy character Faran and when the ageless hells angel vampire walks into a rave and drags all the ecstasy takers down with the cosmic frequency of his tortured soul. Lee's prose isn't even up to par, when compared with her own self, that is. Overall, just a dreadful story that really isn't much of one, and that irked me greatly because it spoiled the mood of the first Scarabae novel."
4,Occupied Japan for Collectors (1st Series),I cannot say enough good things about any of these reference books. My husband and I have learned so much from this material. I will not even purchase a piece until I find it in one of Gene's books. The pictures are beautiful and each piece has an updated value from 1999. What more could and OJ collector want. I would recommend this to anyone who is a serious collector of Occupied Japan. The investment for the book is worth it a thousand times over.
3,Condition Not What Expected,"I know it's used but the description led me to believe it would be in better condition than it was. I was a bit dissapointed and am hesitant to recommend this seller to anyone, great price though. I guess the old saying is right,""you get what you pay for."" Oh well, the content is what's important, right?"
2,They look like broken parking lot lights,"If you like the look of flickering sodium lights like a the Walmart Parking lot, you'll love these.I don't and I guess I'll have to stomach paying the shipping charges to return them."
4,Rechargeable LED Candle packages,"The performance of these lights is quite good. The time beforerecharging is at least as advertised. The recharging systemcould use some engineering work. A better connection betweenthe charger and lights and between lights should be easy todevelop, and a better indicator that the lights are really chargingwould avoid a lot of frustration. It appears that when theinternal battery is low the light does not begin to blink asthe instructions indicate until charging has gone on forsome time."
3,"Great Premise, Unimpressive execution","Every world that has a fall has to have it's own Christ. The book is set in a fantasy world where magic works, but the plot EXACTLY follows the story of the New Testement. The book has great moments, but occasionally wondered and lost my interest. There was a wonderful scene where wizards battled a demon, which was named ""Legion"" and was cast out by the Christ figure. The perfect melding of a standard fantasy plot and the bible was impressive, but much of the book was ultimately not necessary."
2,Disappointing,"I picked this book thinking it would be uplifting and give hope to my son serving time. I'm sooo glad I got myself a copy as well and received it before him. I told him not to read it and send it on to the library or chapel because I found many of the stories full of anger or hopelessness and down right scary. I do think the book would be good for anyone thinking about doing prison ministry work because it gives a good glimpse into the life and feelings of some inmates. But if you are looking to give someone incarcerated hope and inspiration, keep looking.Oh, and as another reviewer mentioned, my son did get kidded about the book because the title is written in a purple/pink color. Luckily he didn't get into any fights over it, but I could see in the wrong circumstances it would be possible."
5,Our Prisoner's Souls Now Has Chicken Soup!,"Unfortunately, we have a large number of individuals in our society who believe prisoners are not worthy of being treated as fellow human beings. ""Chicken Soup for the Prisoner's Soul"" proves them wrong. It shows a compassionate and tender side-something completely opposite of how prisoners are sometimes portrayed. I'm thankful for ""Chicken Soup for the Prisoner's Soul."" I started volunteering at the Missouri State Penitentiary, thinking I had something to offer the offenders. What I soon found out was that they had much more to offer me. I have been blessed beyond words. Now, I volunteer in two prisons in the State of Missouri with Toastmasters. One club is in the Missouri State Penitentiary (The Walls), which is a maximum security prison for males in Jefferson City and the other is a women's prison in Vandalia, MO. This book is sooooo good for the soul! I laughed, I cried, and I could relate to so many of the stories.Pam J. OestreichMissouri"
3,Chicken,This was for some one in jail. He didn't care too much for it. He said it was a big book with different little stories in it that weren't all that interesting.
1,Don't read in the shower,"I sent this to my brother, who's doing three to five for aggravated frottage. He said I should warn everyone not to get caught reading this outside of your cell or the other inmates will make you ""drink their chicken soup."""
5,Hope Can Move Heart/Remove Bars,"Chicken Soup for the Prisoner's Soul is filled with personal testimonies that are both touching, but real. These stories are filled with truth ... real life moments that offer the often despondent and depressed state that our brothers and sisters go through behind the walls and bars of prison life. But these stories also offer us the promises of hope, the beauty of forgiveness, the power of love, and the transformation of self that occurs when these men and women remember the importance of who they really are outside of the confines of being a prisoner. Everyone deserves the grace and mercy of God's redeeming love ... these stories are filled with honesty and hope for a brighter tomorrow ... page after page of inspiration."
5,Not Just For Inmates!,This book is a must read. It will touch your heart and inspire which is what we need in the world we live in today! When I was incarcerated it was the only book I had in my cell and it gave me hope to know I was not the only one with the experience.I Was I Am How To Move Beyond Your Past To Create An Extraordinary Life
5,Super Fast Shipping,Item came exactly as described. Happy with my purchase and will likely order again. thanks for sending this to my daughter.
5,Provides Hope and Healing,"I purchased this book for my husband who is at a Federal Camp. Out of all the books that I have purchased him, this one has proven to be the most helpful and inspiring to him. He loves it. He plans to pass it along to other inmates when finished with it."
1,Junk!!!!!,"Broke the 1st 2 seconds of use, the head is not attached to the handle at all well, danger of swallowing the pieces, -2 stars really."
4,so happy with this item,"I have only used this toothbrush a few times now, but from what I have seen, I love it. My dog does NOT like when I brush his teeth, so I play fetch with him first, that way he is panting and can't keep his mouth shut. Works like a charm!I read a review saying that this toothbrush doesn't brush the back teeth well. I have no idea why not, because the side arms are flexible and open up to brush both sides of all of my Australian Shepherd's teeth. Not sure if they are doing it wrong, but I am very pleased with the way this toothbrush allows me to brush all sides plus the top and back of his teeth. It does exactly what I bought it to do.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I have only had it a few days, and I'm not entirely sure how sturdy it is. It may only last a few days, it may last a few months. If it lasts a year and I have to replace it, I will be more than happy to do so! Besides, gross, who keeps a toothbrush around for more than a year?!"
1,Not conveniet - Dog hates it,"Bought this thinking it will work better than a regular brush. Unfortunately it has a small head and the three brushes are very close to each others making it very difficult to brush the back teeth. Also, my dog will not allow me to brush his teeth and it is even more difficult to use this brush. This brush may work well for those dogs who are okay with the idea of brushing teeth. But I would not recommend it for people who have dogs like mine. I tried it a couple of times and then switched back to the simple toothbrush that the Vet gave us."
3,We went back to the fingertip-style brush,"Possibly it's because we have goldens but this item does not give us the control we feel we need. Our dogs, while enjoying the brushing experience, still move a bit and the length of the brush makes it difficult to wield."
1,Won't buy again,I bought the first one and it broke within a couple months of using it on a very cooperative golden retriever. The place that sold it to me gave me a second one free. It broke just like the first one but even more quickly the second time. Wouldn't buy one again.
5,"incredably impacting work, a must read!","If you are the type of Christian that wants to make a significant mark on the world as we know it, this book will help you. This book goes through the basics of the lost art of discipleship and explains how and why discipleship is the model that Jesus used. Effective discipleship is capable of reaching far more lost people than any other type of ministry because discipleship grows exponentially. In a perfect world, 30 years spent dicipling one person per year, who then goes out and disciples one person per year, and so on, will result in approximatly 4 billion people being discipled.I have been in ministry for about 6 years, and this book totally changed the way that I look at ministry and how I go about it. I have bought as many copies of this book that I can find and given them away. If you can find it used, get it, you will not be sorry."
4,Orion Space Probe 3 EQ,"I purchased one for my wife. We are both amateur space lookers, her more so than I. I have zero experience with telescopes and was easy to put together. We haven't followed the entire set instructions as far as setting it up for East, West ect... but we've looked at some far away ""stars"" possibly planets that has satellite moons or something. Tonight we're going to look at the moon once the scope acclimates to the 20 deg weather and temp. Pretty exciting. I can't wait until we get a more comprehensible knowledge of the most of it. I'm happy for the buck vs. the bang. She seems very happy with it and that makes it worth even more to me."
4,Good Product,"Got this for my father for Christmas and he loves it. Some assembly is required but nothing terribly difficult. Orion also sends regular magazines, perhaps quarterly or twice a year, to upgrade or keep up with the purchase so the support is rewarding to see. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and would one day like to order a telescope of my own, of which Orion will definitely be the maker."
4,Great starting point,"I have been wanting a telescope for quite some time. After looking at several on different sites, looking at reviews, decicded to go with the Orion. Love it! Relatively easy to put together and has been easy to use. Will be adding some accessories a little down the line."
4,Scope,Product was as expected. Instructions for assembly were complicated. Clearer pictures are needed as well as not skipping steps in the written directions. Not a friendly first time telescope.
4,good,"the instructions for assembly may as well be in a foreign language, and it was a miracle i was able to put it all together by myself. however, i bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and his reaction made it all worth it. it is so fun looking at the stars through this... although they do not look super magnified as i would have hoped. the moon is fantastic, though. it's really cool. so...good for beginners i guess, and good for the price, but you might want something a little more up the ladder if you're looking to do stargazing as an extreme hobby. this one does the trick for us."
1,Defective Parts!,"When we assembled the telescope for the first time, we discovered that the “Equatorial Mount” was not machined properly to fit the “Latitude Adjustment T-bolt.” When inserting the Latitude Adjustment T-bolt, the bolt did twist in about 3 revolutions and then stopped and jammed. It could not go in any further as it was designed. Thus, there is no Latitude Adjustment or control of the telescope. I contacted the seller and left a very detailed message. I have had no reply or response from the seller so far. I filed a complaint with Amazon. I will update as the process continues."
5,Great telescope,"This is my first telescope. My wife bought it for me for my birthday and the first thing I did after setting it up was took it outside and saw Jupiter! Using the 25mm and 10mm eyepieces that came with it, I was able to see the dark bands around Jupiter (better on the 10mm) and the 4 Galilean moons! I just got 2 more eyepieces for Christmas and am looking forward to trying them out. I haven't gotten any filters yet, but that's next on my wish list."
5,excellent and thorough but has been superseded,This is an excellent-and lengthy-wordy-text that has been superseded by a newer edition. Flores gives good background on object relations theory and does a thorough examination of 12-step origins.
1,BAD SOFTWARE,"I was completely disappointed with this software. I am a nursing major and desperately needed visuals to go along with my lectures and labs. This software is 1. the worst ever to load, 2. once loaded crashes the computer 3. not very functional as well. I am sorry to say I won't recommend this software to ANYONE. If anyone knows of a good A&P; visual software, please post it!!!!Thanks!"
1,installation problems,"Once you get the program loaded, it has some really great features. However, This program is like a pandora's box problems problems and more problems. It crashed my computer I had to wipe my hard drive. I finally had to get a dummy computer to see what the program held. At the end of the day it was not worth the trouble"
1,Worst software I've ever used,This software slowed down my computer and then didn't ever really work correctly. I wound up wiping it off my computer completely and throwing it away. Plus the visuals are not as good nor the interface nearly as intuitive as my old Softkey Bodyworks software.
1,bad disk,I bought this at best buy and it would not run and the error message was in german. I exchanged it and had the same problem a second time. I contacted the manufacturer and got a new first disk. It now seems to be installed correctly but it asks for a password that I do not have.
1,"Can you say ""hypothalamus?""",The creators of this software forgot to employ an expert on how to pronounce the terms. It is almost laughable how much the narrator misprounces all of the anatomy and physiology terms throughout each of the sections. Pretty sad because the images and videos aren't too bad. But a new student to this information would end up sounding like an idiot of they sounded like this.
4,New twist to a traditional technique,"I agree not awful but different. This is the 2nd book about how to use traditional needlelace in a new and contemporary way- Mozart,farmers with their sheep,gardners and even Henry VIII and wives. Jane N's books focus on long and short stich for small and intricate work. This book is larger scale and creates 3D pictures/landscapes as seen on the boxes in the VA Museum but with a 21C twist and humour. It is a challenging book as you need to bring your own skills to the work as it does not provide patterns or lists of materials but does show clearly the techiques required."
3,fairly even but good listen,it sounds a lot like chris clark's clarence park meets mouse on mars idiology meets akufen's my way. utopia is an awesome track with shredded r'n'b diva vocals that sputter all over the place. hard t*ts is another track that stands out with it's piano melodies and crunchy beats that could easily have been lifted from freescha's whats come inside you. for the most part jackson keeps the tempo at a consistent mid pace throughout the entire disc so it's a pretty even listen. it's the tracks with the vocals that stand out from the pack but not neccessarily in a good way. the track with the little girl nonsensically rambling on and on is a good example. radio caca has a hidden track that starts in at about 18:47. i hate hidden tracks. this is good but not remarkable and there's nothing new or exciting here that hasn't been done before.
4,You're either gonna love it or hate it...,"If you are a fan of electronica, you should definitely check this guy out, but be forewarned that he is a bit of a challenge to listen to, and many will dismiss this as just so much noise, although once I heard the complete first track ""Utopia"", I was pretty much hooked. This is a great headphone album for a rainy day.He does seem to follow a bit of a formula on most of this album and most of the tracks are in a similar vein.The only track that I didn't care for was ""Oh Boy"", with the kid's voice - I ususally skip that one."
1,Too cut up & deconstructed.,"I enjoy the cut up deconstructed sound Jackson is going for here. But this album doesn't come together into something you can listen to. The songs are too free form lacking any point of focus. Mind you I like free form, but I still need something to pay attention to, be it the beat or the melody, or even the pacing, but this is a jumbled up crush without anything to really work with. However, track 2, rock on, is pretty good."
4,So Cute,Love it! Purchased for my little one....this funny looking bunny came in an adorable box. Would make a great gift!
5,"love, love, love this bunny","This is the cutest bunny ever. My daughter LOVES it so much. He's just the right size for the diaper bag, car trips or snuggling with as a bedtime friend. Perfect for Easter baskets too ;o)"
5,Great Cd Keep Them Coming,"Great Cd! I love your band. You have an awesome sound. Have seen you in concert and you are even better live. My favorite songs are Bringin Me Down, Living By the Sword, and Arrival. I would definitly suggest purchasing this cd for any rock lover you know. Keep on rocking guys. Hope to see you in the big spot light soon."
5,Good God Almighty!,"This is by far the best palace record. ""Ohio.."",""Marriage"",""West Palm Beach"", ""Horses"", and ""Lost Blues"" are the top of the heap.There are a few weak spots, but this is how I want my records to be like."
3,Lost Blues & Other Songs,"Palace Music is evidently the musical brainchild of a certain Will Oldham. This album is a collection of songs he performed with an ever-changing ensemble of friends and musicians. The songs lope along at a dutiful pace, like an old, reliable horse. Will's vocals are charmingly disheveled, yet honest and soulful. Songs of tragedy, love and lots of death adorn this dusty diamond, and as I listened they conjured images of pioneer trails, blue skies dotted with puffy, white clouds and apple trees, leaves blowing lazily in the dry, autumn air. Standout tracks include ""Riding"", ""Little Blue Eyes"" and the surprizingly focused ""Gulf Shores"". This is the kind of stuff I always want to hear at open-mics, but hardly ever get to. Palace Music are in no hurry, and that's a rare treat. For my money, this is about as good as Folk Music gets."
1,Just put cover up in your hair,"This is beige, not blonde. It literally looks like you smeared cover up in your hair."
3,Good Temp. Highlighter,This was easy to use and highlighted just a little - better than I expected for a temporary color.
3,Love and hate!,"I purchased this key board to use with my Macbook pro. While I love the action of the keyboard, I am disappointed that the special keys such as the volume and eject button do not work with my Macbook. The manufacture does offer a driver for this product but the driver does not work with the newer Macbook."
1,Icekey Disappointment,"I have been a fan of the Macally Icekey keyboard. Last week the three audio keys in the upper right corner failed, so I just went online and bought what I thought was a replacement.What a disappointment when I connected it today! It was cheap, clunky, and noisy. It went right back in the box to be returned tomorrow.I don't know what I'll get as a replacement. (My grandson has my iMac keyboard.) I'll probably get another iMac keyboard for myself."
4,Excellent choice,This keyboard has a very nice feel which was my most important feature. But one thing I don't like is that the USB ports are NOT USB 2 so you really don't want to use them for plugging in your camera or photo card reader. I plugged in my remote mouse and got a nice USB 2 hub from Apple store that gave me what I needed for my iMac.
5,Applause for the greatest/most profound work of modern lit.,"Werther is *arguably* the greatest literary work of the modern world. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe--world-renowned German classicist and author of Faust, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, and many more--has created a BEAUTIFULY worded story which displays his unique views on love, death, etc. As German author Thomas Mann said, ""...The nerve-shattering sensitivity of this little book [TSOYW] provoked a storm of applause which broke all bounds and fairly intoxicated the world..."" Though the genius of Goethe is praised throughout the world, he is rarely taught in the United States because his work--which is, even at it's dryest, poetic--translates poorly into English. Do not miss the opportunity to read this. If I were to be locked away forever with just one book, I would choose The Sorrows of Young Werther."
4,disturbed book for the undisturbed,"goethe's morbid tale of a man madly in love is purely emotional and beautifully unrestricted. some call it over-exaggeration but when reading the book one must understand when goethe wrote it he wasn't trying to be subtle. the book, written in the form of werther's letters to wilhelm, already gives the reader a personal front. what werther thinks and does eventually, and how goethe writes it, is the strongest reason for this book's attractiveness. this is deep reading best for those who want to uncover a darker side to the human heart and mind"
1,Missing pages?,"So, I'm a little annoyed and stressed out because Amazon sent me a ""new"" copy, that was missing 40 pages. I needed this book for a college course and was tested on it. Unfortunately, it was later in the story that was missing the pages, and I was already only given a couple days to read it... it was too late to buy a new copy and read what was missing."
2,I may have been unfair,"I may have been unfair in my previous review. The foul-up I highlighted may be the printer's rather than the translator's fault. Anyway, a prose writer of Goethe's elegance deserves better."
2,..................,"I would not recommend this book. The portrayal of Werther is very unrealistic and exagerated. The beginning of the book seemed quite interesting, but by the end I was just plain sick of it. His constant, pointless complaining just goes on."
1,Appaling Book,"Yes, quite and appalling book. It is not that the author, Strydom, has a larger than life vocabulary, buthe is unsure what he wishes to express,and he is unable to express anything in simple terms and clearly.It seems if he merely wishes to turn out books and articles, being and academic."
5,Have used for 3 babies,I LOVE this lotion. I have had 3 babies (even one larger than 9#'s) and only have one small stretch mark. It is not greasy and keeps your growing belly from itching. No strong smell either.
5,They Rock !!,I have listened to these guys before on a number of different sites...they are up and comers!! They seem to have that blend of hard edge but the soft blended vocals and all I can say is I got my money's worth and I'm sure you will too!!
4,The Good side of Jim O'Rourke,"It seems Mr. O'Rourke puts out two different kinds of albums. There are the ones like Happy Days and that thing that he did with Sonic Youth that sounds like he turned his guitar all the way up, leaned it against his amp to get some nice stable feedback going, and pushed record. Then there are albums like Bad Timing. Bad Timing is one of the dopest albums. It is mainly acoustic guitar picking, in the vein of John Fahey, with some modern additives. He does a wonderful job constructed peaceful, smooth, unbelievable songs with his guitar. This album is perfect for a calm day, when your doing nothing, sitting on your porch, watching the wind blow the dust around.I can never just go out and buy a jim O'Rourke record anymore. You gotta go do your research to make sure he actually picks up the guitar. And on Bad Timing, he does it brilliantly."
5,the inside of jim o'rourke,too bad previous reviewer doesnt get it all.youre right that album is great! but so are the othersrelax and let it come at you side ways. the man is a mad professor.
1,Obsolete software,"i got this game for my husband for Christmas. The fact that it was on floppies and used DOS should have warned me, but I figured since I could access DOS from WINDOWS the game should work fine. Unfortunately, the game was created in 1991 when state-of-the art was a PS2. Playing the game proved to be virtually impossible, as the two disks had to be continuously interchanged in the drive during game play, and the instructions for downloading onto the hard drive did not work on our Dell PC. If you are a collector of vintage computer games and have an older machine in good condition you might have a different experience than we did. With our newer computer, the limitations of play were too frustrating to make it worth our time."
2,Can plastic color fade this fast??,"they look nice when you get them, but less than a month after i install them (4 sets, different homes) the color in the flags is so fade that today i start to replace all of them, they look like being there for years not days!!! impressive in the wrong way :("
4,Good - but sounds like jet...,A great buy at the asking price. Easy install and works perfectly but sounds like a jet engine at it's full speed.Shipped with NERO and it's really easy to use.
4,A Powerful Little Book,Bad things happen even to good people. In a world increasingly busy and stressful it's important to remember that throughout the tough times God is always there. The short chapters and timely devotions allow the reader to focus on finding strength from the One who is the answer. I especially liked the brief thought at the end of each chapter and the steps to finding strength at the end of the book. This is the perfect book for those going through difficult times.
5,Does the trick,Excellent cat food. The critters love it and (fingers crossed) all signs of urinary tract distress has disappeared.
5,my cats love it,"this is rather subjective, because every cat is different, but my cats love it and won't eat anything else. if you read up on the wysong brand, you will see that the company uses the best ingredients and manufacturing processes which results in the best cat food on the market."
5,Good price for replacement cartridges,I did a little shopping around and found Amazon had the best price on these replacement cartridges. The cartridges themselves are a must for the dog fountain. They're extremely easy to replace. The directions say to replace every 3 weeks but I just do it once a month and it still works fine. An all-around great product.
2,debris get caught up constantly,"As title, everything get caught inside, hard to clean it since my dogs drink a lot. We quit using it after two weeks."
4,Does the job!,Replacement filter for Dogit water bowl. They do what they are intended to do. Keep the water filtered and free from debris. My dogs love the bowl and height. I replace these filters every two weeks and they are very reasonably priced on Amazon.
4,Good for Beginners,"I'm used the Peterson Field Guide for birds and thought I would try the beginner book for trees with my kids. We haven't tried it out yet. Paging through the book, I thought I would maybe find a systematic list, like taxonomic guides. Instead this book is set up like the bird book with similar species types next to each other. While the text and pictures are good descriptions of the trees, it is difficult initially to find a particular tree leaf type without paging through the book. Once we get more familiar with the book layout, I think it will be easier to find what we are looking for."
3,Not what I expected,I thought this was going to be a really great movie but it was just so simple and a little over played. Overall it was alright. I was entertained throughout the whole thing so it wasn't so bad :)
1,Insipid,"This is one of those movies for which success hinges on the charisma of the main character. If you don't fall in love with Martine at the start of the film, you'll find it as dull as a long bus ride."
1,Don't remember,So many words and not a thing to say. Well I hope the review is what the word requirement. K
1,Empty,"This film was a tease. It made you think you were going to get something insightful, intersting, simple yet complex. Instead, what you got was an empty dress rehearsal for a deep film."
1,Terrible DVD Transfer,The 2006 DVD digital transfer by WHAM!USA is nearly unwatchable. The DVD has the look of a bootlegged VHS tape. Do not buy this version.
1,Yikes!!,"Yikes!!!Bad story, bad dialog, bad acting, bad makeup, bad special effects, bad editing, and bad ending.It looks like they only had Linda Blair for half a day; the film is full of shots of a large person dressed like Linda Blair shot from the back, knees down, shoulders down, etc... just to fill in scenes they forgot to shoot when she was there.If you like cheap green rubber masked zombies (fast and slow) in silver suits: this movie is for you."
4,Good Reading - Highly Informative,"This turned out to be exactly what I was looking for when searching used book stores for a reference guide on the kings & queens of England. I've read it backwards & forwards and find that backwards is the best direction, as it is written in reverse chronological order. It's harder to keep track of your pages, but easier to keep track of the subjects of the book. I wish the book were longer."
5,Great product,Love it!!!! It met my expectations and was a wonderful christmas gift for my husband. He immediately put it together and placed it in his garage!
4,"A lot of good songs, highlighted by one masterpiece.","Paper Sun and the many other songs on this album are great to listen to. But Feelin' Alright is one of the finest songs ever performed. Dave Mason sings with such emotion, you can just feel his pain. It is a great example of suppressed emotions just transforming an normal individual into an insane one, driven to insanity by severe depression and desperation. In other words, buy this. If you get depressed, listen to this song."
1,wrong Product Description,"The name of this product is Marknet N7002E but the description is for the N7000e:""The MarkNet N7000e provides secure, manageable network printing to a single USB printer or multifunction product in a medium to large workgroup. The MarkNet N7000e connects a USB printer to your corporate network.""The N7002E has a parallel connection, not USB.Uncertain of ordering this product if there is product misidnetification involved."
5,Makes washing your face such a pleasure!,I got a 1.7 fluid oz tube of this as a part of an Estee Lauder gift set. The product comes out as a very thick pearly paste. Keep in mind- very little of it goes a long way. It foams up very nicely and imparts a very pleasant delicate scent. The product rinses off very cleanly and leaves no feeling of residue. My face feels so fresh and clean and I feel like I just treated my face to a mini-spa- in just a few minutes! I say this is worth the higher price tag because you need to use so little of it. I will continue using this since I love washing my face with it so much.
5,Sturdy and simple,"Strong and easy to use, will remove the most stubborn wheel hubs and a little heat helps."
4,Inspiring worship artists...,"All of Gateway Worship's perfomances are great and it's clear they inspire their audiences. For me, however, Kari Jobe's rendition of Revelation Song is the most amazing part of the DVD. The song, written by Jennie Lee Riddle, is beautiful in its simplicity. The lyrics are nearly verbatim exerpts from Revelations. You can see, as Kari sings, she is filled with the Spirit -- until she is literally over-flowing...it truly is a moving performance. That track alone is well worth the price of the DVD."
3,"Fit Fine, Didn't Last Long","This shirt was okay. It fit me just fine. I am 5'8"" and up until this year I was underweight so it has always been difficult to find clothes that actually fit. Although I liked that it fit me well it didn't hold up well from wear and wash. Its been awhile since I bought this but I think it lasted me about 6 months. I like my clothes to last me a few years since it is difficult to find ones that fit and are flattering to my figure."
3,My Prince Will Come,"We all long to be rescued by a knight in shining armor. Every girl dreams of being a princess and that one day, when her prince comes for her. This book invites us to come and know our prince in an intimate way.It is a love story and the fairy tale that we all have dreamed of. We can take a hold of it today and every day in the presence of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.This book teaches us about preparing for the day when we will meet our prince face-to-face. When He comes, will we be ready for His return? Will we be living out our royal calling with passion and peace prepared for that glorious day?WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group provided this book to me for free in exchange for this honest review as part of their Blogging for Books program."
3,Radio killed the video star,"In the late 1970's this French/Canadian artist was known by his real name Pascal Languirand. In the Mid-eighties he was exploring a new sound and went under the name Trans-x and produced ""Living On Video"" which went on to sell over 2 million copies and reached the British and European top ten charts. This is not a bad effort for a 80's European pop dance song it now actually sounds kinda dated though. The single also contains the Canadian version of the song. Pascal's better efforts are from the early 1990's. 1991's ""Gregorian Waves"" and 1993's ""Ishtar"" the latter being, in my opinion, one of the greatest Electronica albums of all time. They are both sadly out of print."
1,Poor!!!,"After three weeks of minimal use, it stopped working. It's sturdy enough, but if it doesn't work it doesn't work!!!"
4,"Beautiful, if that's what your looking for","Any new album from Vic Chesnutt is cause for celebration, and I'm really happy to see a label support one the greatest songwriters alive.However, there's something about Vic performing with polished session musicians that just sort of misses with me (with Brute being the prime example). When there's nothing off-kilter with the music, it begins to feel too safe. ""Left to His Own Devices"" had me pining for his next studio album, thinking that high production values would deliver something similar to ""About to Choke"". ""Silver Lake"" just seems oddly clean and predictable. His words are still classic Vic, I just wish I felt like he was in the room with me."
4,Comments on Instant Music,This is a good protuct. You will need a preamp between your turntable and the RDX. I bought mine from Amazon. A Pyle Pro for about 20 bucks. see my review on that.
1,Does not work with Leopard,"This product will not work with Leopard, and Data Vision refuses to offer a refund."
3,Walker Exhaust 15642 Standard Domestic Cat. Converter,"I purchased this Cat Converter to replace my defective unit. The description indicated that this Cat Converter would fit my 1994 LeSabre; however, it was very difficult to install and it was anything but east to install."
5,could be great,"I think this cd could be really cool, i now a couple of songs from this band, and they're good, but unfortenelly, I can find it anywhere, not even here, in the best cd store in the internet!!"
2,Forgotten for a reason...,"Make no mistake, there is a reason why this and other Haydn operas have essentially vanished from the stage. This is not the top-shelf Haydn of the symphonies and the string quartets. I bought this because I think whatever Harnoncourt does is usually worth having a look at, but I agree with the reviewer who thinks this is simply boring. The silly and over-the-top production quickly becomes annoying, and after the first thirty minutes, one seriously starts to wonder whether there is actually any real music in this piece... it seems to be an endless chain of recitativos. Even the overture isn't very interesting, nowhere near the quality that Haydn was able to crank out at other occasions. The whole thing just doesn't work for me."
2,One word - Boring,"I purchased this BluRay DVD months ago based on 5-star reviews, but didn't watch it until yesterday. I know that musical taste is just that and quite personal, but this was one of the most boring performances I've ever watched (in spite of the slapsticks antics). First of all, the music is hardly first rate. Haydn wrote magnificent masses, but as an opera composer (in my opinion), he was not at the top of his field. This production tries hard to overcome this second-rate music and in doing so, makes the music even more trivial.I've watched it once and now it will stay on my shelf until I decide to bring it to a second hand store and get some money for it.So much for Amazon's star-rating system."
1,mistake in price???,"I am glad I read the other review that brought this to my attention. must be a pricing error or typo, but why chance it. there are other listings such as unboxed for a fraction of the asking price. this is a great product and subtle fragrance lasts a long time, I'll simplyl get it elsewhere."
4,Really Good,"This book was a really good modern horror book. I love horror books of all kinds, and this one is awesome. The only bad part is when in the wife's point of veiw, she has too many mental breakdowns. But other than that, its a really great book with an ending you would never guess."
4,"Oxford Univ. Press ed - nice presentation, tiny print","The Oxford University Press version is more of a gift or presentation object of this text than a study version. It has a substantial hard cover, gilt edges, and marker ribbon. It is very nicely made. My disappointment with this version includes the limitations of the paper stock (the book comes with instructions indicating that the paper is susceptible to bleed through from pens or other markers) and the small typeface in which the Historical Documents section and Lectionary are printed. This is unfortunately too unkind to my middle-aged eyes (even with bifocals). As much as I like the way this edition is made, I am going to return it for one that can be used for study."
4,The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacramen,"For those who want to begin to pray or deepen your prayer life,, this book is a valuable resource. One of the mosted prised gifts to the english speaking world are the 1,000 or so different prayers for different occation contained in this book. Prayers for the sick, over 10 different, prayers for travel, prayers for confidence and clarity of thought. You can mine this source for new prayer gems daily.Good Luck"
4,Book of Common Prayer,"This book was bought for a healthy 95 year old man who no longer sees small print as easily as he used to - the larger print in this book is very helpful and he can read it in our dimly lit church....because his fingers don't work as well as they used to he would be able to turn the pages easier if the paper were a little heavier, but I understand the need for this paper....He is very pleased to have received the book."
5,"Beautiful language, Inspiring contents!",You needn't belong the the Episcopal denomination to use (and love) this prayer book. The language is beautiful and there are prayers to take you through the entire year. Any lay person who seeks inspiration will find it here!
4,Making Worship easier,The print is large enough and crisp enough to read with ease. The cover though not real leather is leather-like and quite handsome and the golden page edging is an elegant touch. So much nicer to follow along with this book rather than to use the pew books.Glad I purchased it.
2,"OK, but I like the 1928 Edition much better!","Having used both editions, I've gravitated to the 1928 edition and finally stayed with it. The language and theology are deeply moving and satisfying in the 1928 edition while the 1979 is, by contrast, pedestrian and deflowered. On the other hand, if you struggle a bit with the older english of the 1928 edition and don't mind some of the other theological changes, the 1979 is usable."
1,POOR PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,"Please indicate what color of binding you are selling. I was expecting black, or red, just not white. So I returned it."
2,AWEFUL,"You would expect it to be funny........ even slightly good but its a collection of old and weirdy queens that never made it to the ""big room""......... well they must have made it somewhere though if they are on this video????!!!!???? LOL"
4,Conveys exactly what the title implies,"Dr. Jeremiah offers strong truths about angels which are Biblically backed and does so in his own patented, light-hearted way. This book dispells any fictional thoughts one may have had about them. He is indeed a pleasure to read or hear."
4,The purpose of angels,"As the author points out in his book, we see all kinds of angels in art, architecture, and literature, from the chubby-cheeked little cherub to the ethereal angel we see on Christmas trees. However, where do we get this idea of what they look like and what they do?Although Dr. Jeremiah (senior pastor at Shadow Mountain Community Church in San Diego) does give narratives from people who have had ""encounters"" with angels, the bulk of the book concerns what the Bible states about angels. I had to wonder where we get our notions of angels given what the Bible said. There seems to be a disconnect. Jeremiah touches on possible reasons for this disconnect, but the focus is on how angels are described in the Bible.Dr. Jeremiah is a pastor who is trying to instruct us on what the Bible says. Christians or undecideds would find this interesting, but I think anyone wanting to learn more about angels would find this intriguing."
5,Wonderful book on angels.,"This book is very well done and written by a well-recognized author. I have enjoyed it immensely! Wouldn't hesitate to recommmend it to others; in fact, I purchased a copy for a birthday gift for my neighbor."
2,Motorola Phone Tools Doesn't Work For 480g Cell Phone,I am not at all happy with this cd and I don't need the usb 4 pin connector. The software driver will not download! The tools on the cd are not what I was looking for. More details need to be provided about what this product contains with details. I don't want to load my contacts onto my pc. I need to be able to upload video and pics from the 480g cell phone to the pc for sharing. This cd does NOT provide these tools for the 480g. I'm not impressed at all with this kit. A specific cd for the 480g is needed!
2,did not work to well,The plug did not work very well. When I tryed to use the cable link I had to hold the plug in the phone to make it connect. This makes it hard to use the computer and make the phone stay connected to the computer.
1,"Very little value -- cantankerous, exasperating, etc...","I purchased MobilePhonetools 3.0 with the USB Cable and Mobile PhoneTools software for my Motorola v810 phone.First, the advertisement for this product indicates that you can upload and download pictures and ringtones. Beware, your carrier may have disabled this feature on your phone -- mine did.Secondly, the calendar sync software has issues with Outlook and recurring appointments (crashes the sync), rendering it essentially useless.Third, the address sync software is very buggy. It doesn't sync as conveniently as a Pocket PC or Palm would.Forth, the LiveUpdate feature of this application is easily the WORST that I have ever seen. The live update feature repeatedly crashes, hangs, etc... Spent over five hours trying to upgrade, only to have an upgrade not function properly.The data cable's probably useful here, but if you're looking for a sync solution, I recommend you look elsewhere. If I could give this 0 stars I could."
1,Dissapointing at best,"Much like some of the other reviews, I found this product very dissapointing. First, the documentation is minimal. I had problems with the software initializing the phone and after searching through the discussion boards online I finally found out that I needed to download a 25meg update. Couldn't they just make the software available for purchase online? The update did get the phone to work with the software and I can synch my contacts with my phone. The software interface is poorly designed and not very intuitive. It looks like software that was designed in a college computer programming class. Motorola should really take this product more seriously and design something that is more user friendly."
1,Not Worth the Time and Money,"I spent two days trying to install this, downloading the enormous updates, search the Motorola website for support, and troubleshooting the whole setup. There is little documentation, the error messages are uninformative, and the troubleshooting instructions (if you can find them) are not quite accurate or complete, and certainly not easy for a non-techie to follow. It still refuses to recognize my phone."
4,not for media files - verizon customers beware,"Note that Verizon crippled the Mobile Phone Tool Mobile Media function so that you have to pay for the messages if you want to transfer music/video/picture files between the PC and the phone. So if you have this kit, you WILL be able to back up your contacts using this kit, but you WONT see the Media button, and you WON'T be able to transfer any media.The way to circumvent this Verizon meddling, use your TrasnFlash. 1st format the card using the phone interface. Next, use a USB/TransFlash reader (or, if you have another USB/Trans device, such as most digital cameras, you can use that) to transfer files as you would to any other external storage device."
2,Calendar Sync works only partially,I got this from Motorola to work on my RAZR to keep my calendar with me on my phone. The sync for the calendar works with Outlook 2003 but it won't sync recurring events that have an end date.
1,Make sure to install the latest version from the Motorola web site,The shipping version 3.0 did not install properly on two of my computers for the Motorola RAZR. You need to run the provided Live Update utility to download what I consider the working version (4.04b) from Motorola. This was Motorola cutomer support's advice. Version 4.04b appears to have been developed by a different provider and detects and communicates with my phone properly.
3,Mom likes it...,"Elmo and Cookie Monster - together again.This toy is cute. When you push Elmo's mouth, he says ""Jiggly, Giggly! Ha ha ha ha!"" as the ball vibrates. Push Cookie Monster's mouth, and he says ""Shaky, Shaky! Ha ha ha ha! Whooooa!"" If you pay too much attention to Elmo (press him 3 times in a row) Cookie says ""Hello?"" Likewise, if you press Cookie 3 times in a row, Elmo says, ""Elmo's turn!"" Push the two together and they say ""Giggle Monsters!"" and laugh.This toy is not very soft (it's not plush) and the inner mechanics make it heavier than you would expect. The eyes and Elmo's nose make it pretty useless for rolling. But the sounds and vibrations make my twin 20-month old boys smile, and they play with it on occasion, but it doesn't keep them occupied for long stretches. As for durability, it appears well-made, but I don't think ours has been used enough to really put it to the test.Overall, it's cute, but I think I like it more than the boys do."
1,Elomo $ Cookie Monster Giggle Ball,The screw to open to replace the batteries was stripped and hard to open. Finally after getting it opened and iserting the batteries. it only worked for a second and you had to beat it to make it worked. I was too lazy to return it....
2,Not an Attention getter,"My grandchildren may be too young, 12 months and 15 months, but they find this toy boring. I have to push it down for them to giggle and that's about the gist of it. Besides some giggles and vibrating for about 10 seconds, there is not much more to this toy. Save your money."
4,Humidor,It is an excellent product I recommend it for those people who beginning in this world of the habanos
4,Solo Safari,"Purchased on-line from Amazon.Com, Solo Safari arrived quickly.Terrance Cacek, takes you to the wonderful world of African hunting, without the benefit of a guide. The dangers, the pitfalls, the adrenalin rushes, and much more are all yours. Friendships are formed with the staff he hires for his trips, and the humor, excitement, joy and pain, can be felt as you read the chapters.Although I'll probably never be able to go on an African Safari, Solo Safari has brought me one step closer, and enjoyably so."
5,A perfect introduction to Brazilian samba,"I'm so glad that this record is finally back in print, since it is such a great overview of Brazilian instrumental music. Half scholarly, ethno-musicological exposition, half booty-shakin' block party, this is a fab collection of instrumental tracks that run the gamut Brazilian dance styles, from thumping bass-heavy batucadas and slinky capoeira to sambas and proto-sambas like the maxixe, baiao and choro. Although true to the rhythms, Da Sousa's ensemble leans heavily towards the melody, which is just fine by me... I love this album! Highly recommended."
4,4.5 stars,"Where this recording is not as strong as John Barleycorn, Low Spark and Shootout it is still a terrific disc. This was Traffic's swan song in 1974 and they wouldn't regroup until the 90's with the regrettable Far From Home. The musicianship is exceptional as they continue to mine the jazz-rock vein presented within the three above mentioned recordings. This disc is somewhat darker than earlier releases but holds up equally well over time. Standout cuts include Dream Gerard, Love and Graveyard People. Highly Recommended...Simon"
4,If it OnlySounded Better,"I was blown away and at the same time disappointed in this cd. The music and performances are stellar. This is superb blues, my foot never stopped tapping. The problem is and I agree with the reviewer Somebody, the sound is not excellent by any means. I have an expensive stereo sytem and it reveals the recording as very sub par. Bass lacks and the guitars are not all that clear. Albert King and SRV In Session is a notable example of a great recording. If this cd sounded as good it would be tough to beat."
3,Solid music & enjoyable Wendy James vocals,"I know that it's in vogue to slag this group, especially among the professional music critics, but hey, they sound good, Wendy looks great, & I like them! As a matter of fact, I'd say that they were the best band around during the late 1980s & early 1990s! This CD is not up to the high standard of their Velveteen period, but it's solid music & enjoyable Wendy vocals. I like Wendy because she doesn't try to imitate Barbra Streisand...she aims a little lower, like Debbie Harry! And she succeeds at creating her own simple sound. They don't exactly make you forget Bob Dylan with their cover version of ""Crawl Out Your Window,"" but they make it work on other songs, like ""B with U,"" a single from this album."
4,A sad end to a great band.,"The final album of `Transvision Vamp'- `Little Magnets Versus The Bubble Of Babble' is once again a mixture of good and fairly good songs. The record label actually refused to release this album for quite some time- though I fail to understand why- after all, it's no worse than the other two Transvision Vamp albums. Especially good are `Crawl Out Your Window', originally by Bob Dylan and `Pressure Times'. I personally find `Back On My Knees Again' rather sad, as it marks the last song on the last album by this group- a sad event for all its fans. Fans will love it- others... well, it certainly isn't bad. Still obtainable through some places, though hard to find, sadly."
4,These clubs (set) are great!,"Got this as a starter set for my wife, she actually had never golfed before, and you know how that goes, she started out a little shy and timid, but by the end of the day it was hard to get her off the course. She loves them and the whole package is actually better than a set I purchased that were more expensive for myself. So I recommend them for you guys who might be thinking about getting your wife or girlfriend out on the course with you, they are worth what you pay and then some.Quality is good, covers are very good and bag is exceptional. no standing legs but the balance makes it a stand alone bag and I cant find anything wrong with this set.James S. Orlando Fl."
2,Desperately seeking an editor,"It takes a truly ungifted writer/editor to transform such a sordid topic into such a boring read.With little original research of any value at his disposal, Fleming leans heavily on other books and magazine articles. The book's most annoying feature is its mindless repetition. Quotes and anecdotes that appear in one chapter are re-introduced in another chapter (see Simpson's public humiliation of Craig Baumgarten in an 1985 Esquire article) or, worse, in the same chapter (see Fleming's ""where are they now"" summary of Bonnie Bradigan).What's worse than Fleming's shoddy writing (pick a tense, Mr. Fleming, any tense) is his utter lack of insight into Simpson's admittedly repellant character. The author is content to spread unsubstantiated rumors and dwell on the most minute detail of Simpson's bizarre sex life without even once delving into the psychological reasons/motivations for such repulsive behavior."
4,High Concept,"A great inside look at the insane world of Hollywood. Don Simpson is a clear representation of how your personal habits and experiences have little to do with your success in Hollywood. If you know about Simpson and his lifestyle, this book will serve as a tool to further insight into a mad genus of the classic Hollywood narrative. If you are unfamiliar with him, this book will widen your eyes to the excesses of Hollywood and what really goes on beyond the red carpets and glamour. A great inside peek at the world of Hollywood and what makes up the people that make the movies America loves."
3,A good fluff read,"It reads like a magazine article (and takes just about as long). It makes good airplane reading or beach book - ie, a great deal of concentration or thought is not needed. As previous reviews mentioned, it looks like the editors invested little effort (many times stories are repeated verbatim within pages of each other), but what do you expect from something like this? Don Simpson was a bozo, which present some serious constraints on the literary quality of the book. But his pathetic existence does provide its share of amusing anecdotes. If you want to read something along the same lines with a little more intelligence - read ""Money - a Suicide Note"" by Martin Amis and the movie ""Swimming with Sharks"" is fairly good."
4,"worth a look, maybe two","High Concept is a must read for anyone interested in the who's, the why's the who-done-who's of Hollywood. It falls a little short as an actual biography of Producer Don Simpson, but more than makes up for that with a generous helping of party anecdotes and production war stories, some of them old news, some of them nearly unbelievable, almost all of them illuminating. The book leaves some of the ""why"" questions answered, in some cases raising more than it puts to rest. . .why, for instance, if Don Simpson was so consumed by his demons did he still manage to maintain his ""edge""? Still, perhaps you should find your way to the questions through this book, and determine the answers on your own."
1,Muck Raking with Charles,"Are you interested in knowing about the Industry, what high concept is and its effect on today's motion pictures? If so, don't buy this book. Author Charles Fleming is more interested in exposing Don Simpson as a lying, pill-popping, whore whipping, dictatorial ego-maniac than as the inventor of how modern Hollywood now creates product for your local multiplex. The book is entertaining in a very voyeuristic way. ""Oooh, did he really do this?"" ""Ugh, what a scuzzball"". But after awhile it all becomes long and boring. While the underbelly of Hollywood isn't for the timid, Fleming seems to take great relish damming Simpson and all his kind to the hell that they have created. For my money, I would rather have learned more about the development of High Concept, how it was accepted and its current effects on how decisions are made and films produced. You'll find better writing in the National Enquirer or the Star than High Concept"
3,All over the place,"Although this was a fairly interesting read, the author is all over the place throughout the book. Nothing is linear, he goes back and forth through time, throws in gossip about celebrities that may or may not be true, that makes the entire thing a bit difficult to read. If you're interested in the movies, I would say yes, read this. If you're interested in gossip, Heidi Fleiss, Demi Moore's excessive needs, etc., then you should read this. I, personally, found Easy Riders, Raging Bulls a more interesting read than this one. Don Simpson is a little hard to relate to, and I wasn't sorry when he dropped dead. It's difficult to see why Jerry Bruckheimer stuck with him for so long."
4,must-read about a Hollywood sleazeball,"I have'nt decieded yet whether Don Simpson was more of a repellant monster or a pathetic wretch,but either one,he was certainly a miserable excuse for a human being.It's scary and sad that it's people like him that are making decisions about what kind of movies will be coming out of Hollywood.Even more appalling is the thought that Simpson was not unique.He just had to die suddenly to get a book written about him.A must read for anyone who wants to know how Hollywood really works."
4,Constitutionally Incapable of Surrender,"Don Simpson's life and lifestyle is a fabulous expose of the power of drugs and the ability, for those to whom they are accessible, to destroy their lives. The details and excesses of Simpson ran rampant until, like they always will, took control and left him another of Hollywood's wasted talents. Hard to put down, nonstop excitement! Good grounding material!"
3,A family estate with a tale to tell - perhaps another time.,"How does a slender 30-something mother of two make a real life for herself, when her loudmouth misfit ... of a philandering husband departs for England and a dashing young yachtsman comes calling? Tend to her garden? If her husband is her choice, how does she aid him to overcome the disrespect of practically everyone who knows him, including her parents, the hired help, even their teenage son? There are the makings of a good story here.Unfortunately, I found this first novel to be very much a freshman effort. The main failing was lack of gut-wrenching scenes, those that draw the reader in emotionally. I recall only one, and the author rushed through that one. The characters are hardly able to engage with one another and remain disconnected throughout. Most disappointing was the treatment of the Mason family estate, Mason's Retreat, which was never allowed to reveal its dark secrets."
3,interesting,"Well written, engrossing novel that is a continuation of the the story about The Retreat, a mansion/plantation in Maryland, and its hold on the people who own it.It's not necessary to have read the first novel; this one can stand on its own. A bit predictable, but an acceptable exploration of family dynamics. It does make usage of one of the modern novels standard catalysts for plot development- the damage that non- communication within the family will cause to those involved. Once you accept that the plot is somewhat formulaic and that the ending is predictable, you can relax and enjoy the reading."
4,REFRESHINGLY DIFFERENT--DESCRIPTIVE-- GOOD STORY!,AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNT OF AN AREA OF THE U.S. AND THE TIMES PRECEDING W.W.2.THE AUTHOR IS CLEARLY AWARE OF THE RURAL AREA OF THE EASTERN MARYLAND SHORE AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE IN THE EARLY 1900'S. IWOULD DEFINITELY READ MORE BY THIS AUTHOR
4,well -written,"This book does not let you go after you finish it! The mood, characters, and setting are so well-drawn and all are hauntingly depressing. The story itself, set in the 1930s in Maryland (with ties to England), matches the era in its sadness and upheaval. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it was just so sad and disturbing to me for some reason, but I think that's because it was so well-written that I actually felt bereaved."
4,great glove,"leather could be a little less stiff, but i'm sure it will soften in time. exactly what i wanted and couldn't find in stores. fit perfectly."
2,Not quite what I was looking for,"I was looking for a natural history of the white mountains. Sargent's book is more of a journal with some interesting asides on biological topics but I felt I was skipping over a lot of the content looking for something new. I also did not feel much confidence in the science, where I could find it. When an authority consistently mis-spells the younger dryas as the younger drydas it doesn't instill much confidence. I'm also not sure that the asteroid that hit the Yucatan causing the extinction of the dinosaurs was the size of Texas. I don't think anybody knows that. Overall, it was a bit simplistic and wearisome to read. Not what I was looking for."
2,Read Bill Bryson instead,"William Sargent is kind of the poor man's Bill Bryson: he gives natural history and geologic background while trying to maintain a loose narrative structure, and he succeeds about as often as he fails.I thought this book was going to be some kind of adventure tale of roughing it for a year, but it turns out that Sargent lives in the Notch, and kept a diary for a year. The book as a whole is kind of like the pictures in it: occasionally interesting, but fall short of being really beautiful because they're rendered in poor-quality black-and-white printing."
4,"Careful, considered guitar music","All instrumental in the style that you would expect from a Slint/Tortoise/Stereolab stringed instument player. One song sounds almost precisely like The For Carnation. Pajo plays very cleanly, subtly and at a stately pace. The tracks that work extremely well (2, 3, and 4) highlight the lack in the others but although the arrangements are extremely sparse, the record never really becomes dull. It suggests alot of space (both because of reverb and skeletal arrangements) and it has the atmosphere of music created by one person, alone. Lots of reptitious, overlapping patterns, a few non-standard time switches and really great use of a phaser pedal. It's pop music and there isn't any pretense of expirimentationl; it is nonetheless really pretty. Good music to listen to while you: a) do homework b) draw maps with autocad c) watch crowds of people disperse while staring out onto 8th Ave from your apartment. Soundtrack music in a not unkind sense."
4,Nice to meditate,"Beautiful organic sound accentuated by the simplicity of its compossition. The album integrates string and percussion instruments along with keyboards and synthesizers to create slow but inviting rythms. Aerial M has been characterized from other post-rock bands by their incorporation of deep silences into the development of their music. This is percieved throughout this work and specially in Aass. This does not mean, however, that the final result is a monotonous sound. Quite on the contrary, the overall album has an irregular acoustic geography, going from lethargic tunes (as in Wedding Song No.2) to more energetic compossitions (Compassion for M). The outcome is a state of a hyptnotic introspection where one is easily lost unnoticedly."
5,good enough to question at least half your record collection,"First with the influential Slint then the even more influential Tortoise,pajo has shown to be one of the most talented musicians at work these days.And his solo album is a testement of these skills. Working at a nice slow pace the songs build,layer atop of layer,repetitive,gracefull,sad,and filled with that elusive sense of space.Thankfully all the songs on the record are wordless, creating a mood that grows from the first song to the last working off each other amazingly well,and in the process makes a great imageless film score that gets better with each new listening.one of truely great albums of the last decade. !VIVA LA PAJO!"
3,"Very nice record, but docked a star for brevity","""NYC music lover"" has nailed this disc so all you need to decide now is if you are prepared to fork out effectively full price for an album that runs under 32 mins. It's a warm and humid night; I've put this CD on at low volume and it's hit the spot. By putting it on ""repeat"", it sounds like Pajo's revisiting the same themes every half-hour. You could try and convince yourself that it's value for money that way. No, it didn't fool me either."
4,4 great tracks/renditions of a great club/trance tune,"Love the tune, and love Brittany's voice! Each DJ puts his individual signature on each of the four versions included on the CD, and the CD, in, and of itself, very clearly demonstrates how these mixers/DJ/producers can really add so much of their own creativity. I certainly got my money's worth."
4,Who Knew?,Who knew Brittany could sing? I didn't. I was ignorant I suppose but she does a good job here. Paul lays down a good beat and catchy hooks and makes you wanna dance. It's not a complicated song full of all sorts of gimmicks but rather a simple song with a good beat. An excellent dance tune that belongs in your dance collection.
2,mixed review,"I am a neuropsychologist (and Assistant Professor of Neurology at a major university) studying for board certification. This book was recommended study material. I found the basic neurology review quite helpful, but the discussion of individual diseases/conditions were mixed. It seems as if Kaufman has overstepped his areas of expertise. The lit review for many areas was sparse and he presents things as solid facts when, in fact, the empirical literature is quite mixed (and not having citations in the text makes it all but impossible to do fact checking). Other information is just plain wrong. The material in this volume is too wide to have been written by a single author. Kaufman would have been better off serving as an editor, having experts in a given area write the respective chapters."
4,Recommended,"Quite heavy reading for a review book. Very intuitive writing with good illustrations. Not a quick review but certainly solid learning tool. Some psychiatric elborations are over stretched. Overall, recommended if you are relatively weak in neurology. Quite expensive though :-)"
1,Egregiously Inaccurate,"Inaccurate on ME (CFS) and Fibromyalgia. Says such untruths as there is no good evidence for neurologic pathology in these diseases and that there are no objective abnormalities associated! (p.91) There are over 4,000 articles in peer reviewed medical journals showing frank biological pathology in ME. ME causes an enormous amount of morbidity and suffering. The propagation of falsehoods like these contribute to a huge amount of iatrogenic morbidity (and sometimes mortality) for people with ME."
4,Wood?,"From the picture, I thought this would look sort of like cherry or cedar. It turned out to be more of an oxblood red, with black ""grain"". Once I put it on my phone, though, it didn't look bad. Although it doesn't exactly look like I expected, it's still very attractive. It also fits my phone perfectly, and snapped on very securely. It's plastic, but it doesn't feel at all cheap or flimsy."
4,smell so good but,i like so much the fragance of nivea pearl the only issue maybe is not good wetness protection but i can see on the label is only deodorant not antiperspirant so anyway smell so good.
5,wish we could buy in US,I love this product; I first purchased this spray deodorant at a resort in Mexico. I'm grateful that I can still buy it online but wish I could just get it in drug store.
1,"Cannot play them as they are Region 1, not All Regions","Do you have any with the old format? I can only play them on the computer. Celtic Thunder are releasing all their DVDs for All Regions. You would have better sales, if this was possible, if you did the same.The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible: The Easter Story"
5,Great Read!,"Henry Morris does an excellent job of explaining what those in the naturalistic community and reviewers on here that hate christianity do not want the world to know, that is true testable science does not refute the bible. Since any arguments against the one constant taught in this relativistic world that is not allowed to be debated, naturalistic evolution, are not allowed, readers must turn to sources such as this book to get the real scoop on how things possibly occured. Do not be put off by the reviewers that slam this book because of their agenda. It is an excellent read for those of a scientific mind and even those that are not highly scientific. I would wholly recommend this book."
5,Purina One Salmon & Tuna,"My 11-year old Himalayan cat, Simon, has never eaten anything nor liked anything other than Purina one Salmon & Tuna flavor. Now all of a sudden ""Smart Blend' has taken its place on the shelf....why? He doesn't like it.....will you continue to make the original blend that he eats??? The little paper inside the bag even states that cats may not like the new blend at first but to mix it with the old blend until they are used to it.....again, why??? Please continue to make the original formula."
1,sinead lohan disappointed,I have no mermaid but this was not as expected. I thought this was under produced.I still like her voice.
1,Wet,"This is nothing but a nylon bag and a zip loc mylar baggie. It didn't work to keep things dry at a recent trip to the water park despite double bagging. All that was in it was a set of keys, some cash & cards. These items managed to push open the seal of the mylar baggie. I would not recommend this."
3,not as reliable as we wanted,"we got these for snorkeling in hawaii and 1 of the pouches seemed to let allow a small amt of water in but it wasn't clear how and we weren't sure if it was in our method of sealing or what - and by the end of our trip it became clear that one of the pouches was actually punctured and the seal itself seemed to be holding up fine. but even with that, nothing was tragically wet to the point of damage but i worried a bit each time we used them."
4,loksak,"Received promptly. Looks just like the picture. Haven't used it yet, but think it'll be great for snorkeling and some diving."
2,Even Nora Roberts Can Have A Bad Day...........,"I love Nora Roberts, but this book asked for too much suspension of belief. The young and lovely B.J. Clark is the manager of a historic inn in New England. The new owner, Taylor Reynolds, comes in with plans for renovation. Taylor and B.J. spend the entire book arguing, since B.J. is resistant to any change whatsoever in her beloved inn. Taylor is surely the most benevolent boss ever, since he tolerates B.J.'s attitude and doesn't suggest she seek alternate employment. After spending 200 pages arguing bitterly, they decide to get married. Good luck, you two.....Excerpt from inside the book:""When handsome new owner Taylor Reynolds brought a pocketful of renovation plans for B.J.'s beloved inn and a blueprint for her seduction, the course of true love did not look smooth!"""
2,Waste of paper,"I didn't like either character in this book...Taylor was a manipulator and BJ changed like the wind. And who in the world proposes to a woman after 2 weeks? YECH! I can tell this was an early book of hers. Nora...you've come a long way, baby!"
2,Yikes,"From This Day is as skillfully crafted as all of Ms. Roberts' books, but it's certainly not her best work. The heroine BJ, is almost too precious for words though a lot of words are invested in describing her; and the hero Taylor, is obnoxiously Alpha--almost squickily so.BJ is trying to save the inn she manages from being modernized and improved by the new owner, Taylor. He, of course, is mightily attracted to BJ and spends all his time courting her at the same time he's hiring decorators and architects. Incredible?Yes."
3,NOT QUITE,"I was disappointed in this story, though I read it to the end. Too unbelievable and far-fetched. I recommend it to Nora fans, though because it is worth the read."
4,A good primer,"Few , if any, contemporaries surpass R.C. in his field of religious endeavor.This work is pretty lightweight compared to all else he has written.That being said, ""The Dark Side of Islam"", is a decent primer but goes no further.IMO, if the reader is interested in amplifying the issues, he/she will have to look elsewhere.Still worth the time to begin your education on a most serious issue that confronts us today."
5,Bad to the Bone is good for the soul,"This book is very good for all teenagers. It is a 13 week bible study that is broken down daily. The chapters are short to keep a teens wandering interest, but packed with a lot of usable information. If you are a youth leader, or just want a bible study for your teen, look no further."
4,Good product,"I purchased this product over one year ago. The fridge and warmer work very well, but the radio is somewhat marginal. Also, the fan is somewhat loud, but it is tolerable. I am happy with this product and would buy it again."
1,Bad product,This product was not good. First time plugging in truck & the adapter melted. I would not buy this product again.
2,Save your money. Its very cheap,"I just opened it up. It sort of gets cold and hopefully gets warm.The AAA batteries were dead. The battery lid doesn't fit normal AAA's like eveready.The radio sound is really tinny.The 12v plug was so tight it wouldn't insert until I worked the contacts with pliers to get them to slide.Its made of cheap plastic, the box doesn't snugly latch.Nearly all the label stickers fell off in 5 minutes. The plastic taped logo was bent and never stuck to the latch. It fell off when I opened it. I just threw it away.All the bad stuff said, it was starting to cool and presumably it willwarmer with more time but I haven't even got that far with it.Spend your money on something more useful than this thing."
2,not good,"broke fast and didnt really cool well, i bought one for more an d iv had it for a while and its perfect"
5,Great item,"These are some of the most accurate hygrometers that I have used! They are compact enough to fit inside a guitar case, or a 1QT canning jar ;) Also accurate for large room measurements."
4,Works as promised,"This is an excellent little hygrometer for sticking in a guitar case to make sure the instrument is properly humidified. It takes up very little space, provides what appears to be an accurate readout, and does its job admirably. Of course, if I needed a hygrometer for desktop or wall use, this wouldn't be the model I'd look for, as it's pretty small. But for stuffing into a small space, you can't do better."
1,Overpriced,I ordered this product November 9 from Western Humidor. It was sold for $24.50. Now it is being sold at Amazon for $17.68. Big price difference in a matter of 12 days! price is not competitive.
1,OFF ABOUT 10-12% TEMP VERY ACCURATE...,"VIDEO of Caliber III not tracking correctly... Had two other Hygrometers at different parts of the humidor and they all coincided against the caliber III. All the other Hygrometers tested and calibrated to ""Humidipak"" calibration test and all were dead on 75.5%"
1,i think it needs calibrating...,"I had this thermometer for around 3 years inside my humidor and now I'm sorry I trusted it. I just bought a new wine fridge (for the cigars and the wine) because this thermometer kept saying my old one was too warm. Then I inserted the thermometer inside the fridge and it never seemed to go down below 62 degrees even though I had set the fridge at 55. Well, I just put a mercury wall thermometer in the fridge and it went down to 54 immediately, while this one still showed 62. So it's off by about 9 degrees! I could have kept my old wine fridge too..."
3,Acceptable accuracy but...,"I got one today, compared the reading with a recently calibrated industrial hygrometer. Caliber III is about +4% off at around 42%RH environment. It's acceptable for the price, but not in +/-1% accuracy as claimed."
1,Doesn't Work,"The display for relative humidity on this device always shows ""--%"". I returned it for a replacement. The replacement also displays only ""--%"" for RH. Since I must pay return shipping and this costs nearly as much as the original purchase, this device just went into the trash."
2,It was off,It was off 2% when i got it and there is no way to recalibrate it. The box claims its so accurate out of the box that other companies that make hydrometers use it to test they're products. If I was to do it over again I would buy HygroSet II Adjustable Digital Hygrometer instead. If that one comes and is off you can recalibrate it to make it read correctly.
2,Worked well for a short time,Worked great and then the battery (I think) died. Did not last long at all. The battery should have lasted longer.
4,"Reliable, Cheap, and Close To Maintenance Free","Well, where do I start? The Caliber III Thermometer/Hygrometer is a basic, fairly accurate way to maintain a stable environment in your humidor. I question if it is has a 1-2% deviation without being able to calibrate it with the salt test.I like the option of being able to re-calibrate so that is why I also purchased the newXikar Round Calibratable Digital Hygrometer ThermometerAll in all, my cigars are in good shape so that must mean it's doing a pretty good job keeping up with the relative humidity and temp of my igloodor."
3,Slow to respond to humidity changes and not as accurate as others,"The unit I received reads about 6.5% low. Also it takes a very long time to adjust to changes (took a full 12 hours to achieve a steady reading in a controlled environment). These two aren't really issues of themselves, but one of the key features is that this device can monitor highs and lows during the day - with such a slow response to changes, I'm unlikely to really see high/low peaks.Overall it's usable, but the cheaper analog gauges I have are more accurate and respond quickly to changes."
4,"Works nice, display is a little too dim","Easy to install anywhere, and appears to be pretty accurate. I use mine as little temp. And humidity displays thought the house and they work pretty good. Only issue I have is that the display on them is pretty dim. Would be nicer it was brighter."
1,Inaccurate,"I bought this product to use in an incubator believing that the digital readout would be easier to read than a traditional thermometer. Unfortunately, the reading took wild swings and was unusable for that purpose. I tried to use in in a brooder but had the same problem. It now resides somewhere in the back room... I no longer use it."
3,Wrongly accussed,"This product arrived as stated in the advertisement. I apologize for wrongly accussing the seller of inflated shipping. As I reviewed the order, the item was shipped free. Again, please accept my apology.The item work from the moment it was activated and is just what I wanted. Very good seller and product."
1,Poor product performance.,Stopped working within two weeks of receipt. Contacted Western and was told to return at my expense or to purchase a new battery. Should this product only perform for two weeks?
4,Great device,I have 2 of these for both my humidors. About to get another one till I saw that the price went up by almost $10! I bought this back when it was $14.
5,Another Vote from a Guitar Owner,"This is the hygrometer that keeps my Olson guitar in check. I couldn't feel safer with anything else in it's price range, nor doubt it's accuracy. Love it! You will too, if you value your guitars."
3,Not so accurate...,"I bought two of these for my guitars. There is a constant 4 unit difference between the two (48% vs 52% humid, for instance). I will have to get a third one to know which one is the least accurate! Temperature seems accurate enough but that's not why I bought them."
2,ripoff on shipping!!!,"i gave the product two stars....it would have been four if not for the shipping costs....the product works great and i would gladly buy more, except for the fact that amazon in screwing people on these items when ordering more than one.....i placed an order for two and they both arrived promptly in one bubble wrap mailer.......why was i charged twice for shipping one package? shame on you amazon!!! i suggest finding a different place to purchase these , better yet....contact the seller directly....."
2,My Hygrometer was off 3 degrees,I was disappointed to see that the temperature guage was off 3 degrees. The seller replaced it with a new one quickly however and the 2nd one was very accurate. The humidity setting are easy to use and very helpful.
1,Inaccurate,"I live in Las Vegas (humidity 5 to 15%!!), and bought this after getting a Graco humidifier for the bedroom.This little toy does not read anything under 20% humidity, so it always shows ""---"" as the humidity in my room. When the Graco machine shows humidity 30#, this one says 20%. Not sure which one to believeTemperature reading is accurate, hence the one star I gave"
5,Great Wine Cellar accessory,Great for the wine cellar and cigar humidor. Even better was the size - very small and so is not noticeable.
1,piece of crap,"what a joke - what a ripoffdoes not calibrate - check the video on YouTube of the cigar aficionado who can't get the thing to calibrate -it's hilarious on the one hand, because he goes on and on and never gets it to workdespite following all directions it insists that I'm living in Arizona or something - temperature registering 8 degrees higher and humidity 20% lowerpiece of crap"
3,Digital Thermometer/Hygrometer,"This item is much smaller than I expected, measuring less than 4 in. long. You must be close to it to read the digits, otherwise it is satisfactory and delivery time was reasonable."
3,Works Well Enough,I bought it for my guitar that needs to be maintained at a certain humidity. I like that it is small and fits in the case. I did that salt test on it and (if I did it right) the humidity read about 10% below actual humidity. This is the only hygrometer I've ever owned so I don't know how it compares to others. But it works adequately for me especially for the price. Higher accuracy is going to come at a higher price.
1,Not so good.,"Got this item and put it in my humidor with another perfectly calibrated hygrometer. I got for a second humidor. According to the instructions it says it does not need calibration because it was calibrated. It was off by 20% at reading humidity levels. So I took it to a cigar shop that I usually go to and had them put it in their humidor and it was still off by 20%. Being as dumb as I am, I threw all the packaging away and couldn't return it."
5,great for guitars,"Was delivered before delivery date. Only complaint was the box looked like it had been tossed around in a drying machine a few times. However, it has worked perfect and has worked to track the humidity for my antique guitar."
1,Ready to return this JUNK,"Not sure why so many 5-star reviews on this item. Mine works just like those 1-star'ers. My other 2 hygrometers showed 27% and this one showed 17% initially and went down to --% eventually. I will tolerate it if it's +/- 4% but this is totaly unusable. My guess is there is a batch of bad units for the unlucky 1-star'ers. I did noticed that almost all the high-star reviews were in or before the first half of 2009, and all the low-star started in 2nd half of 2009. So, Cigar Man, please return all your current inventory to the manufacturer."
3,I bought two just to watch for any great deviation,"after the first two days, they were consistently off by 4% (72% to 76%). Bear in mind I had them next to each other within the humidor for testing purposes. I guess the obvious question is...how accurate a product is this if they are off this much?"
1,Crazy fluctuating readings,"Bought this hygrometer for my new 100 cigar glass-top humidor (which is wonderful). The specs were great: accuracy to 1% humidity, no calibration required, max and min reading memory. However it did not work as advertised. first day it recorded 55 - 120 degrees in my humidor! Clearing the memory did not help. Placing a second (desktop) hygrometer in the humidor and the Caliber 3 was way off. Had to throw the Caliber 3 away. My stash of cigars is too expensive to trust to this. Ended up buying the round digital unit which can be calibrated with the salt test."
5,Nightmarish,"This album is so good it's scary. This is some of the most powerful and professional extreme music ever made. Each song is perfectly balanced and ranges from moments of slow, deep despair to furious, violent fits of rage like you can't even imagine. It's like the music gets thrown into a high speed blender and then you throw the blender into a tornado. If you like metal or industrial music at all, then you Need this album. It is Seriously good."
2,"Great, for the VERY SHORT time they actually work","Bought these on Sept 18th. They worked great, just what I needed. But the one bulb blew out a few days ago (Jan 9th I believe). Ok, so maybe that was just a fluke. I put the other bulb in and said to myself, ""Ok, let's see how long this one lasts"". Well, I already have an answer for you: not even a week. I just had to replace it with some other's I ordered when I used the second one in this package. So the scoop is, DO NOT buy these bulbs. I gave it two stars because for the 3.5 months the first one worked, it was great. But for TWO bulbs to blow out so quickly, it's not worth the money, time and effort to order these."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was happy to find this silk pajama set, at a reasonable price, but after putting it on, it became immediately clear that a bargain isn't always a bargain. These pajamas look good as long as you're standing straight as a manikin...but as soon as I began to move in them, it became clear that they are cut poorly, and restrict basic movement...sitting, raising your arms... a simple movement puts undue stress on the seams, and they'll very quickly be ripped to shreds. Live and learn, I guess."
3,"Nice, but small","Got these for my ""real man"" sized husband, only to find that the XL is not cut nearly as generously as most XL jammies. They looked great, but were really tight across the chest so would have been very uncomfortable to sleep in. Company was good about taking them back (tags and original packing only)."
3,Needed batteries,"I bought this as a gift and it arrived with dead batteries. It is packaged tightly so I had to open it to put new batteries in. All in all, not bad but beware that is has been sitting for awhile and the batteries may be dead."
4,"before night and day, you have to listen to hise ablum","when i work at 9 to 5, every day, every week , every year, losing the track is one of my problem. Byt this problem is healed by music of movietone which not only heal my saily life, also help a lot on my work. Cos i know human beings have to work day and night, and do the music for night and day."
4,"Great stories, poor binding!","This would have been a 5 star rating if not for the incredibly poor binding. Only reason all pages are still together is because of carefull handling, I'm afraid it'll selfdestruct the second time through.The stories like in the Animatrix are extremely varied and usually surprisingly good (despite high expectations!). The styles range from comic to realistic and there's even a fully written story in there.If you liked the Animatrix, you'll probably love these as well."
5,Tell me more of Matrix...,"For everyone that want to study in deep the Matrix World.Buy it, it's very good reader."
4,"Excellent comic book,EXPERT shipping.","If you're a k.R. fan,this is a must for collection.What I really have to say isn't about the item. Since I like all of my collectible books in PRISTINE condition,I order them from the Amazon store.The care that is taken in protecting the book is top notch!My experience:The books are first wrapped in plastic or bubble wrap,secured to a thick piece of cardboard and mailed in a sturdy box...O.k Now I'll focus on the product.Nice graphics.Nice story line.Well worth the purchase-no matter where you get it from.SUPPORT OUR TROOPS.WE ARE FREE BECAUSE OF THEM!!!"
5,infinity speakers,These have been great going on 3 years now.. sound is crisp and clean and would totally recommend these to anyone that loves high quality sound!
3,Not a children's book--adult content,"It's a fun book. But please be aware --this is NOT a children's book. Very adult content. Rated ""R."""
1,Yoyette,Bought these to make parallel lines in my hair like they did in the forties only to have to pull half of my hair out with them.
1,Horrible....and smells funny too,"didn't end up using any of the clips...they are useless and don't really hold a lot of hair and on top of that, they have a funny metal smell that lingers on the hand that you used to clip with....yuck...."
2,I wasn't impressed,"I had such high hopes for this product, but alas, I was not impressed. I received little effect from it and the lotion has sticky feel. This isn't something I would purchase again."
5,MORE POWER!!!,"I had forgotten all about this show until a few years ago. I did a little searching online and this is honestly the ONLY thing I could find. It's only season 1 so you don't get too deep into the series itself, but it's a great show for kids or young adults, like myself, who want to remember a simpler time when Saturday morning cartoons were all that mattered. The show itself doesn't have the craziest plot or story line, but it's a solid program that also has some morals sprinkled in for the young kids. Compared to most the crap that passes off as kids shows these days(Besides Adventure Time, Regular Show, and Clone Wars) Medabots is a breathe of fresh air, and in all reality is pretty original especially for the time period it first came out. I would recommend this to anyone under the age of 25 that either A) Has kids or B) Enjoys anime style shows along the lines of Pokemon."
5,This is the seminal CD for classics in the Paradise Garage!,"The music on this CD is phenomenal... this 2 CD compilation is the BEST summarization of the beautiful music that was played on the Garage's loud and crisp ""Richard Long"" system. All I can say to you is... GET INTO IT!"
2,animals in 3 dimensions,"May be a basic pop-up book, but fine for children who will discover in 3 dimensions, lions, tigers, penguins, bears, elephants"
5,A masterpiece of the ethereal,"Urthona is thre exactly mix of the beauty, ethereal, paranoic, mystereous, you can feel the music breaking up your soul, with the sounds of Olaf Parussen, the Voices and the cello Stoa makes of Urthona a poem of the other side of the music, with this CD this german group becomes in the most representative of this kind of music (dark ethereal), Urthona has the feeling of Blak Tape, the quality of Dead Can Dance, the charm of Human Drama, Excellent......"
2,Craftsman 9-44594 3/8 Drive Torque Wrench,"I was in need of a 3/8 drive torque wrench to replace the original craftsman wrench I recently dropped, breaking the click-detent mechanism. (I've done this before and fixed it). The original wrench was all metal, and has been in use since I purchased it new in the 70's. The new wrench has a plastic handle and locking mechanism that I was able to easily defeat. Contrary to the ad, YOU CAN TURN THE HANDLE AND CHANGE THE TORQUE SETTING WHEN LOCKED, particularly easy under stress of gripping the handle and pushing the wrench. Please note, THE WRENCH DOES NOT TORQUE IN THE CCW (left-hand thread) DIRECTION. The new wrench is also much larger (longer and greater diameter throughout) than my original, so fitting into tight places is going to be difficult. My advice would be to spend the money for better quality, an all-metal body, and a flex head if one can afford it. I intend to fix my old wrench and have it recalibrated, using the new one as strictly back-up."
5,A fine novelization of a tragic day,"This is the 1962 novel upon which the film ""Nine hours to Rama"" was based. The ""Nine Hours"" are those leading up to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948.Unlike the movie, the book does not open with the assassination itself, but with the assassin, Natu Godse (a fictional name) boarding the train that will take him to the prayer meeting where, nine hours later, he will shoot the Mahatma and brings sorrow to the whole of India. From the beginning of the book, the reader already knows what the tragic outcome of the story will be. And yet, I found myself getting so caught up in the lives of the different characters, that I could hardly put the book down. It's really too bad this is now out of print, and I hope somebody does a reprint, because this is a really great novel!"
3,Africa Unite,I was involved in the preparations for Africa Unite when the Marley family visited Ethiopia. I am also in the movie. Need I say more!!!
5,A must have,These socks are fantastic. Nice cushion in the heel and toe. I've given them as gifts and everyone loves them! The sock is nice in cowboy boots and winter boots.Don't be surprised when you open them and see they look small. I actually called the company and told them I had bought them on Amazon and was worried they would shrink. The company rep told me if I had any problems to contact them and they would send a pair that would fit should anything happen.Well they went in the washer and dryer and stayed true to fit.Not only are they a great sock but they are MADE IN AMERICA!! How can you go wrong. Pay a bit more and keep an American in their job.NOW GO OUT AND BUY A PAIR! You'll love them in your boots. Thats a promise.My husband found a local cowboy boot/clothing store and bought several pair that are much longer. He couldn't believe how great they feel while riding his Harley. And he wears them in his boots at work.
3,Good socks.,"Heavy duty, warm and comfortable. particularly good for long periods on your feet.The only negative comment I have is that the sock doesn't come up high enough. The top should come up at least 2 inches higher."
5,very thick,"I chose 5 stars because I love THICK soft socks, these are very thick, so if you need a thinner sock to fit in your shoe, don't buy these.I wear these for work in my boots, and for running in my running shoes, for walking the dogs in my sneakers, and trail hiking in my trail shoes. They are very soft, and have no seam discomfort.I wear these in the winter and the summer.They last a long time, the first place to wear out is the heel, and I usually see it before I feel it.I have very large calves and most socks are too tight around the top, these socks are very soft and expandable around the top, but I have no problems with them staying up.I recommend these to anyone that are on their feet all day, but have enough room in their shoes to accommodate a very thick sock.A little pricey at $13 a pair, but definitely worth every cent!!"
1,NOT thick at all,"Not very thick at all and my toes are cold even in the 60's and 50's in boots, plus they sweat and make my feet stink, not even my cheap socks do that. I'm disgusted considering how much I paid for these."
1,Screwed up store,"I orderd this in size 9,two pairs, and recieved a size 6 ""small"" with one pair and a childrens book. When I emailed them to correct, they then sent me two more pair of small. I emailed again, and the responce was, ""We can not do anyting else for you."" I will never shop from them again."
5,Love these socks!,"I started wearing these Thorlo Thick Cushion Hiking Socks a few years ago based on reviews and I am delighted. Since their sizing is more specific, the socks fit perfectly, not too big like most. There's no extra material bunching in my shoes. These are now the only socks I buy and wear them year round. They are not cheap but they last an amazingly long time. Worth the price! (But I did stock up during a sale!)"
5,I love these socks,"I usually just wear running socks, but decided to get these socks because we were going to be hiking in the mountains. I opted for Thorlo's because I have had great luck with them in the past - these did not disappoint. They work great and feel great. Keep in mind that these are thicker socks, so if your shoes run on the smaller size, these may not work."
5,Worked well snowshoeing,"I bought these to go snowshoeing in and they worked very well. At the end of the day my feet were warm, dry and comfortable. They just feel really nice to put on."
3,Comfortable but Washing Creates Lint Balls,"These are comfortable and do keep your feet warm but they pilled after washing and looked 10 years old. If they hadn't, it would have been 4 stars, but since they did, 3 stars it is!!"
4,A sociological classic,"A very interesting classic of sociological analysis of class and status in the United States. Very well written, perhaps a little boring when reporting details about people not very much known to europeans nowadays. I was lead to read it after having read Santayana's ""The Genteel Tradition"" and I was not disappointed.The Protestant Establishment: Aristocracy and Caste in America"
2,"Outdated at the time of printing, but parts are entertaining","This book was the last volume of Drouet's revision of the Cyanobacteria. He was a botanist of the old school, and his resentment of the new microbiological methods of studying Cyanobacteria is expressed here in an entertaining diatribe. The drawings are great but not plentiful, and it may not be very clear which conventional species that they refer to. Drouet lumped most of the existing genera and species of Cyanobacteria together because of his belief that most of the morphological variation in the group was caused by environmental diversity and not by genetic diversity. This belief was based on a series of unpublished experiments, which bred criticism of his methods. Mainly good for historical purposes."
2,"""Used"" means USED","I purchased this book expecting it to be a bit worn due to the age of the book but was disappointed in the wear of it. The book appears to have mildew on the binding and pages and it feels dirty to the touch. If I had not paid so much for the book I could accept the condition of the book, but if you pay over $10.00 for a used book, it should be in better condition."
3,Medium Rock Pick,It's okay. Not impressed with the way it feels. probably the handle grip could be changed to improve.
1,Bogus...,"This book's title suggests that its about winning ""NEW"" customers. However, more than half the book is about maintaining relationships with existing customers and how to ""win"" back lost customers. Review the table of contents by clicking on ""Look Inside This Book."" Only 1/3 of the book (30-45 pages, tops) is about winning ""New"" customers. Even the material actually devoted to new customer acquisition is remedial. I suspect that the other reviewers are friends of the author. Overall grade: F-."
5,Easy to put together,"This doghouse is great. It is large enough to fit two dogs of about 40lbs when they ball up. My problem is my dogs are not trained to use dog houses, just their crates in doors so they are unsure of what to make of it. Hopefully soon they will enjoy laying in it to get out of the cold wind.Only con was some of the corners were chipped when I opend the boxes, but nothing that I would want to take the time to send back. Would purchase again if necessary."
1,Horribly awkward acting,"The two young 20-something leads here may go on to better things, but their acting skills in this low-budget indie are borderline amateur. They play the entire, mercifully short (70 min), film with fake cutesy smiles and forced expressions. Neither one is likeable. Their road trip to Napa Valley has some nice scenery, but that's the only redeeming quality in this painful disaster. I did like the indie soundtrack, but those are a dime a dozen these days. The lispy male lead was perhaps more annoying than the female, though why she thinks she can ever convert a gay man is the central flaw in this completely absurd mess."
3,They should change the name..,"This movie wuz disappointing just cuz the gay guy iz having an affair with a women and endz up with her. How lame iz that. He haz a boyfriend, a ""girlfriend"" (who haz a boyfriend also) and obviously flirts with guyz in front of his girl. How Rude! and to top off this line of pathetic lust she can't seem to stay away from he who doez not respect otherz. The drama in this film iz enough to keep me watching."
3,Is good but became ineffective,I used to use this but i dont know if they changed the formula because it stopped working. I switched to psoriatrax.
4,Something that ACTUALLY WORKS,"I've had Psoriasis since I was a kid. I'm now nearing 30 and I've yet to find something that helps- until now. Short of using prescription shampoos and creams, this is the best stuff I've tried OTC. After just a few applications, I noticed a difference in the areas that have been bugging me on my scalp.There IS some odor (think T-Gel), but it's not strong and it does wash off your hands with one wash. The cream can be a little greasy but does absorb into the scalp quite well- You won't immediately need to wash this out a few hours after application.I have moderate-severe scalp Psoriasis, as well as atopic Excema and some other skin issues, and I must say this is by far the best OTC product I've come across so far. Would be 5 stars if not for the slight odor and mild greasyness."
5,This really works,"I have been using this product on a very difficult patch of psoriasis since mid-November. Everyday I apply the ointment and cover it with sticks-to-itself tape. Since it is on my big toe, there is a lot of friction and it has been a challenge to calm down the psoriasis, but at last I can look at my toe without cringing. Im fact, I had previously tried several prescriptions, including Taclonex, but this works better. I wish this company had something for scalp issues as this ointment is too dense for using on the scalp."
2,Seemed to me mostly oily,"I did try this product but it doesn't seem to have worked as well as others indicated. It really made my hair so oily that even with applying the shampoo two times the residue still remained,which I didn't fully realize till I dried it. It took an entire next washing to get it all out. Maybe it works great on elbows and skin that is not the scalp which is where I have the most problem. For me Psoriaflora Cream works best - doesn't clear it all up but helps. Corticosteroid cleared it up very nicely but caused the IOP intra-ocular eye pressure to shoot up and I needed a second eye drop daily to get that back under control. So I am staying away from corticosteroids and the best I have yet found is the Psoriaflora Cream."
2,stops itching but does not cure seborrheic dermatitis,i am using this shampoo almost 3 weeks it stopped itching but does not help my seborrheic dermatitis. therefore coal tar causes can cause cancer so i am going to throw away these shampoo. just waste of money
4,MG217 Medicated Tar Ointment,This product works. It is milder than others yet effective. Good price and quality. I use it as needed. Product continues to suppress condition without side effects. Very satisfied.
4,Not prescription strength but okay,I ran out of my prescription strength psoriasis cream for my hands and thought I would give this a try. Seeing the reviews and and price I figured why not give it a go. It does work but definitely over the counter strength. Much weaker then the steroid cream I was previous using prescribed by a M.D. but it does in fact work. The smell of the coal tar is very pungent and takes some getting used to. Overall my skin is improving day by day.
2,not very good,"i bought this together with Oxiphor VHC although it does moisturize the skin it didnt do anything else for me,did not get rid of redness,in some areas made it worse,but with all the topical treatments for psoriasis not all work for everyone.."
2,"Good when you use it, getting worse when you stop it","I used to use another product, it has good effect on control the size.I only had on elbow. I bought this product because it has good review.I used it three times a day, the skin surface become flat.However, just the time I think it's good enough, it become worse. The infected area are twice bigger now.I guess you have to keep using this product, which makes me feel not safe."
4,Best Over the Counter Psoriasis Med I've Tried,"This ointment worked better than any other over-the-counter med I've used, and I've tried many others (Psoriasin Gel, Dermarest, etc.). This ointment is really good at covering up grey scales. It moisturizes flaky skin so that it's hard for someone else to tell that your skin is peeling. However, I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because it did not completely clear up my psoriasis."
5,for my familys skin,I had to buy this for my granddaughter who is visiting. She has excema. It helped her a lot. It is very nice for the skin.
2,Not that helpful,"Everyone is different, maybe this will work for others, but it really did nothing to help my Psoriasis on my arms. The product was what it's advertised to be, but just was not effective for me."
2,Relieved itching but patches are still there,"I give this two stars for relieving itching but it didn't remove my patches. Any suggestions for a better product would be much appreciated!I wanted to come back to this and say that I purchased Champori, and that actually took care of my problem! It's pricey but worth it. :-)"
5,Affordable and Effective,"This stuff worked for me, and quickly, when nothing else did. My experience seems to be echoed by others.The only negative is that it is not really made for the scalp (and the package says so) because it has the consistency of vaseline. The company makes a shampoo as well, but I have not found that to be as effective."
4,Great Product,I purchase this along with the Sal-Acid Ointment a couple of months ago. This product does work.I've had a issue with scaling along my hairline for quite some time. I normally switch between both products. I'll use the Sal-Acid Ointment one week and the next week I'll use the Medicated Tar ointment. My scalp looks so much better; the scaling is now gone!
4,"The order is strong, but it definitely works","If you ever miss the days of visiting your grandparents and other senior citizens, spreading a thin dab of this stuff anywhere around your nose will bring back those memories. Good googly moogly this stuff is strong! Certainly not for the early morning public transport commute, but definitely OK for home use. You don't need a lot, and this 1 jar will probably last me for more than a year. I've used the Tri-Derma Psorias product which up until now was the best stuff out there. However, when the 2 are compared - the the Tri-Derma does not produce a noticeable odor, costs about 3x more (per oz), but doesn't work as well as the MG217. Despite the odor, it's worth the $13 to try this stuff. If they can produce an odorless version - 6 stars, until then 4."
3,Okay for what it is,"This will not take away your psoriasis--nor will any other product or procedure, no matter the claim. If though you're looking for some relief, this lessens the scaling, which I suppose is why it's an old tried and true remedy for psoriasis. The down side of MG217 is that it's based in petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) and along with the tar can stain clothing and bedding like mad. I wish the key ingredient, tar, had been put in a more soluble medium. I use the stuff only when wearing or touching something I don't particularly need to keep free of yellow stain"
5,AMAZING,"I bought this about 2 weeks ago, and this has made my psoriasis fade away. I have tried many products and this is the one that has really worked. My psoriasis was getting really bad and know that I started to use this product they are fading away... I am so exited that I finally found something that works..."
5,The Best!,"For use on my espresso machine at home, I've tried various espresso coffees sold on Amazon. Most have been very good. And if doing a side-by-side taste comparison, a few of the past ones probably better than others. But this one is noticeably the BEST. Especially in drinking espressos, rather than lattes, etc., the coffee flavor on this blend is superb and the absence of any bitter taste is immediately noticeable. For use in an espresso machine, this is the one!"
3,Just Okay,Purchased item to shampoo my mother's hair. The tray does not fit sink. Sink too deep. She has to hold the tray with the back of her neck.
2,Disappointed,I don't like the fact that you're not able to tilt the head back far enough and my clients found it uncomfortable. It's too bad. Maybe the neck grove should be deeper. Some waterproof rubbering for more comfort around the neck groove would also be good. Has anyone found a shampoo tray that tilts the head back more and that's comfortable? Let me know. Thanks.
3,hair washing tray,"If I had to do it over again, I would not buy this product or recommend it. It's uncomfortable and is difficult to line up in our sink with my mom's head."
2,Mismarked package,"Apparently this product is available either with putty tape or with butyl tape. I ordered the butyl tape version, but when I opened the package to install the roof hatch on my travel trailer I found that I had the putty tape version, not the butyl tape one. The packaging is apparently the same for both, except for a sticker that identifies it. Mine was mismarked. I used it anyway and expect that it will probably be ok.Camco 25013 RV Universal Vent Installation Kit with Butyl Tape"
1,don't be tempted by the bargain price,"I came to Amazon shopping for a new iron because my B&D; Light 'n Easy has built up a black, sticky, tar-like substance on the plate. I assumed something I had ironed was mislabled and contained synthetic material or something, until I saw all the terrible reviews here. Apparently the non-stick material is defective. At first the iron just became slightly sticky and no longer glided easily over the clothes. But this morning it actually destroyed a shirt by getting the black gunk all over it. No wonder it's such a bargain! Like someone else said, this iron is not even fit for donation - it's going straight in the trash.For users of this iron who are just in the ""slightly sticky"" stage, stop using it now before it ruins something!"
4,exceptional buy!!!,"I love this iron, it glides across your clothes like a feather. Plus it was less than $7.00, an absolute EXCEPTIONAL BUY!!!!"
1,Bad iron,This is not a good iron. The bottom burns easily and will leave stains on your clothes. Buyer beware!
1,Don't waste your money!,"My 17 yr. old Sunbeam iron died suddenly and I didn't have time to research irons. I was desperate and decided to try this inexpensive Black & Decker. What a mistake! This iron constantly splatters water onto garments leaving spots that don't disappear upon drying. The sole plate grips and rubs across clothes instead of gliding. And you can't use your hand to hold down your garment while ironing without the steam burning your fingertips. If aggravation, spot-stained clothing, and red blistered fingers are your thing, this iron won't disappoint."
2,Worked well while it worked (barely 2 years),"I love the long cord on this iron, and when it worked, it worked great. However, after two years of light use (as in, months of not being touched and occasional weekly use), it must be replaced. Water leaks constantly from where the cord attaches to the iron."
2,It was so bad I returned it,"I product was given to me for Christmas. I wanted a light weight iron. It most definitely is. However, you do not receive a smooth gliding action when pressing. the red part is the water fill. I use only tap water. You are unable to see the fill line or watch the progress of the water.I will go back to my Rowenta which I had for 16 years before it gave out.I would not recommend this iron to anyone. I usually like the B&D; productsPatti"
5,Field Guide to the Birds of Cuba,"Great book if you have an interest for Cuba's birds. Great pictures, very well written. I wish it would have the birds cuban names. I have enjoyed it very much."
4,What is that bird again?,"Excellent and very scientific guide. The descriptions are excellent and all the information extremely useful. It's obvious that the authors are experts in their field. I found the plates top notch and, I'm sure, they will allow quick identification of any bird we see. A couple of defects: The common Spanish name should be included in the plates. Imagine the guide telling you ""That's a siju platanero"" while the plate only calls it Cuban Pigmy owl!But that is minor compared to the lack of cross-reference from the plate to the text. The other guides I have state the page with the information about the sighted bird. Here you must go through the index or leaf your way to the correct text. Other than that I really enjoyed the book."
4,Buy in advance,"Excellent and vital piece of work for the average bird watcher in Cuba. Please purchase before travelling to Cuba, as in the country itself you'll be unable to find ANY fieldguide on birds!"
1,"Unfunny, offensive","It looks as if I'm going to be in the minority with my opinion of this book but, in short, I loathed it. I didn't find the story remotely funny and, in fact, I found that the way the heroine was portrayed was tantamount to mocking the afflicted. The hero's treatment of the heroine made me wish that she'd find someone else.Add to that the anachronisms and the simply unbelievable events, and I can safely say that I will never ever again read anything by Mary Kingsley."
5,great night shots,Camera is way better than the sony HC1. Night shooting is great and colors appear natural and there is not much noise or smudging of colors. Would recommend it in a heartbeat. My 37 inch 1980x1080 LCD becomes an window when I hook up this camera to it. Great buy!
1,Needs Work,"Generally used by schools as either a requirement of a ""partnership"" program or because they are generally the first texts on the market describing the new Microsoft products the Academic Learning Series has the feel of something that was rushed to market and contains incorrect information(ex. a Novell network is based on a workgroup ) and alot of concepts presented in the text are not explained in any sufficent detail so as to justify their appearance in the text. An example being a reparce point, which is defined as somenting that adds functionallity to the file system, this is the extent of the definition given. The books of this series are definately supplemental material and if the course is taught by a tallented individual they have their place. However if your instructor is going straight from the material presented it will not provide as good of a learning experience as an unbiased text might."
1,A journey into the imagination,This is a book which aims to appeal to people's prejudices and fantasies. Lack of proof and quantum leaps to dubious conclusions mark its arguments. It is a singularly unscholarly work where the diving line between fact and fiction is difficult if not impossible to discern. As a serious work it has little merit as a work pandering to people's superstitions and assumptions it may succeed.
5,Fantastic,"Regardless of the previous reviewers feminine angle I found this book to be amazingly concise and covering all the aspects, indeed even those supposedly left out. I have also just read Gardiner's new book Secrets of the Serpent, which goes into much more depth. The Serpent Grail is about the Grail and it's links to the serpent worshippers of the past. It reveals the elixir of life and therefore is not a mythological encyclopedia as desired by the previous reviewer. Secrets of the Serpent reveals much more than any other mythological book of the serpent and even comes up against the Da Vinci Code. The Serpent Grail is an amazing new angle on the Grail lore and one that many scholars have reviewed glowingly, so it has to be worth a look."
1,"Adventure did not ask, but no harm done","Another of the genre, ""truth behind everything"". The title alone is enough to draw one in, yes? Why not say it is a ""secret"" revealed and sell a few more? From the beginning of the ""secret"" of the grail it was said that unless ""adventure"" asked, one should not speak, or in the nascent case, write about the grail. However, when you have missed the proverbial boat by as far as this work does, it makes no difference. The truth is so simple-and that is the only way it can survive. Be entertained, but don't be fooled, as the dog clips your heal, from beginning to end, it would seem...."
5,A special book to share with your child,"A beautiful daily devotional book with scripture stories and daily activities, including a bible reading, question or thought for the day, a short prayer, a message from God and a short Bible verse to learn. I am looking forward to integrating this into my children's bedtime stories as a wonderful way to end each day in prayer."
5,"The ""Bible"" for the Parent of a Dyslexic Child","When I first got this book, I cried! The pages with the examples of what a dyslexic person sees, is unbelievable. This is a book full of EXCELLENT information. Unfortunately when I shared my copy of this book with someone, I did not get it back; so now I am purchasing another book. Extremely informational!"
4,Another delightful project from Azucar Moreno,"From listening to this CD once through as soon as I bought it, I found three VERY likeable danceable tunes. Ole, Flamenco and Cumbaya. Surveying the rest of the album I found more subtle, yet still enjoyable and still danceable songs that made Azucar Moreno famous to begin with. The voices of these two women are pretty much what makes the music so powerful for me. Soft as silk sometimes, yet sometime harsh as flint. More than the music or vocalics involved, I found that the meaning and amount of expression were also very very engrossing. This album had many songs about enjoying song and dance and life in general. And that is what I certainly did while listening to this compilation. I hope they don't stop anytime soon. They have amazing amounts of energy life within them."
1,Buyer Be Very Wary,"The trusted leader in children's learning really blew it with this product. I bought SS Baby deluxe, SS Preschool and SS Toddler for my 2 and 4 year olds. My little girl was SO excited to play these games but Uh-oh. The small print says several of the disks DON'T WORK ON WINDOWS 2000 and they were developed for XP before the program was released so it is shaky on XP machines too. The bottom line - we can't run most of the CD's - some will install but not play. Some won't give the sound, some won't install. Very disappointing. Also Encore (who produces product) says on their web that they don't do refunds - you have to go back to the original store. Also they don't have an 800 toll-free number so you have to pay for support calls. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM SESAME STREET. I WILL BE VERY WARY OF ALL THEIR PRODUCTS NOW"
1,Program doesn't even work,"Program does not work at all on Windows XP, at least the copy I got does not.P.O.S. Don't buy it."
5,Can't go wrong with Sesame Street,Sesame Street has stood the test of time. Preschoolers can benefit from the 3 Pack
4,beautiful gothik,"This is excellent gothik (not the trite `i want to be a vampire` trash). Beautiful female vocals and a droning electronic backdrop. If you like Die Form, QNTAL or Venus Walk, I think you will also like LICTD."
4,Scraper,I was looking for a small scraper for my sons car. this was the size we were looking for to fix in the glovebox of his care.
4,More about management than leadership....,"Maybe when this book was written (in the late 1970s) people didn't distinguish management from leadership. I read this book as part of a class on Christian leadership, and though this is recognized as a classic, it was not as good as several other books in that regard.If you're looking at leadership from a Christian perspective you might consider:Transforming Leadership: Jesus' Way of Creating Vision, Shaping Values & Empowering Change, andServant Leadership: A Journey into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness 25th Anniversary Edition.However, if you are really interested in developing management skills for use in a Christian organizational context, this might yet be a good book for you. Just remember, this book is a bit dated in some of it's workplace references...."
5,Successfully Integrates Biblical Thought and Secular Theory,"Engstrom has written an excellent book on a topic not many have able to accomplish: how to integrate the Bible with secular theory.Among the important points Engstrom makes include:1. What biblical leadership is and is not.2. A true leader must not be driven for the thirst for power.3. A mark of maturity is the ability to handle conflict.4. Suggestions on how to improve your attitude and those who follow you.5. For a leader to excel, he must find other interests outside his job (family, friends, hobbies, etc.).6. A leader will be effective when he adopts goal-setting and planning as a personal style of life.7. Using creative problem-solving.8. A Christian leader must point others to Christ instead of himself.Read and be encouraged and challenged to become a better leader!"
4,"A very nice album, a bit of a departure from previous releases...","I am pleased that I bought this album. I think that the arrangements are fresh and interesting. And the tracks with vocals (by band members, not Harry) are really fun. I enjoy being introduced to new songs, and this album delivers."
3,big band sounds of new orleans,a collection of standard and non-standard arrangements that remind HCJ of New Orleans. The journey of the album seems to bring about an eclectic view of a city built beneath the sea. Nice in the background while working.
3,Light entertainment,"Bradley Smith's review is dead on. Most of the elements of this film are competent and engaging, but there's nothing really deep here. Standing Still provided a good hour or two of escape. I've seen several of these ""just before the wedding"" ensemble movies, and this one holds its own."
2,Amy Adams is the best thing about this movie,"This movie is definitely aimed at the 20-something crowd. I didn't much care about anybody in the movie, but it was great to see Amy Adams do her thing before she hit the big-time. Her lesbian kiss/tummy snuggle is easily the highlight of the movie!"
3,Slow moving story without much of a plot...,"The story takes place during a 48 hour time period prior to a wedding. If it wasn't for the profanity (the ""F"" word being used 42 times), nudity, drugs, drunk scenes and underage sex I would have thought I was watching one of the less entertaining episodes of Friends."
5,What a help!,WOW this book has everything. I love how it gives a condensed yet comprehensive review of each area of nursing. I've been a LPN for 16 yrs and am now back in college to get my RN. This book is a perfect refresher and learning source and I highly recommend it.
4,"Good, but basic","I feel like there is a good bredth of basic information given in this book, but if you are looking for in-depth science this is not the book for you. I have a background in science and to me the science in this book is very elementary. If you are in search of general baking information and a broad overview of how things work you may enjoy the book. If you are interested in chemical mechanisms or protein chemistry for example, choose another book."
3,Textbooks should have more information,"When I bought this book, I knew it was a textbook, but I'd hoped for more information than what I found in this book. They do cover each factor/ingredient, but they give pretty little, considering this is supposed to be a textbook. It's a decent book for a hands-on/laboratory class, but I was hoping for more theory and a bit more expansion. Still keeping the book... I guess. (Haven't quite made up my mind.)"
3,Not so sure it was what I thought it would be.,I didn't understand that it was a work book for school. Not what I thought it was.
5,"A ""must"" for everyone who bakes!!!!","Truly a scientific vision on everything that you ever need to know about baking. The information covered in each chapter are essential knowledge for everyone, whether an experienced bake or someone who is just getting started. I have been baking for many years, but after reading this book, everything seems to make a lot more sense to me. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in baking whether professionally or just for fun....."
2,Cover Stick for gray,"It will do the job, but not as well as the other brand I have used and do not acccess to purchase."
4,"A different ""flavor"" of K'tonton","For dyed-in-the-wool fans of the little Jewish Tom Thumb, this book seems odd -- it is not typically ""K'tonton"" in that it does not center around a particularly Jewish exxperience -- though it brings Jewish thought and ideals to a more American aventure. The kids LOVE K'tonton and this book is a hit, nonetheless."
3,Veronica Mars Season 3,I have only watched season 3 and two of the disks were damaged in several spots each. There were scratches on both disks.. I will be watching season 1 & 2 in the near future.
1,disappointed,"I was so excited when I got the complete first 3 seasons of Veronica Mars for such a good price. I watched the first 2 complete seasons and everything was pretty good, there had been a few hesitations on a few of the DVD's, but nothing too bad. Then I put the first DVD of the complete 3rd season and there was no sound. I tried several of the other DVD's in the package and even tried a different DVD player in my house but they still exhibited no sound. This was very disappointing. Amazon made it very easy to return them, however I lost money on that as I sent it priority for $11.95 and was reimbursed $2.98. But the worse thing of all is I am still without the First complete three seasons of Veronica Mars. I hesitate ordering them again because will they come from the same warehouse and have the same problem, I do not know. So that is it!"
2,Anthony churns out another poor effort,"Some authors work on bulk. The problem is that once an author is established (s)he can write and write and no one seems to care if the writing turns to junk. Copper is a perfect example. The cliches are forced and painful. The writing isn't too bad, but there's nothing there to make a reader care. The characters have no depth, and the basis of the entire plot is unimaginative. The idea might have been interesting in book one (and I stess MIGHT HAVE) but by the third installment of the series, we really need something fresh and new. Not rehash.Anthony will continue to churn out 2-3 books per year. His name is firmly established and bookstores eat up big names. But until he sits down, thinks up a good idea and takes the time to pull it off, don't bother. Personally, I'd take my chances with a brand new author. You know a new author can't publish this kind of empty junk."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted one great dictionary for reference as I just got started with my aquarium a few months ago. I found this to be badly indexed, and since it is alphabetical by Latin subspecies and then Latin name within it, they assume a great deal of knowledge right off the bat. Then you need to look up the common name in the index to find the latin name and my most common fish aren't even in there under common name (ie., Molly, Platy). Guppy is under ""D"" in the index, a typo for ""G"" - which makes me think this wasn't even proofread. I really didn't need information on freshwater fish like bass and pike, since those aren't aquarium fish, so don't understand who the audience is supposed to be. Many fish in here measure over a foot in length. I have an aquarium, I'm not going fishing."
5,Encyclopedia of Exotic Tropical Fishes,"Excellent textbook on freshwater fish species and specific details on each fish. The best book I have found for researching an incrediable number of freshwater fish! Pictures are excellent. The beginning of the book covers history, systemantics and speciation, anatomy and physiology, nutrition and feeding freshwater fihes. In addition, the textbook touches on reproduction of fishes and general but detailed information on aquarium management. The profiles of the fishes is extraordinary and easy to read, with excellent pictures! I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys having and keeping aquariums with EXOTIC freshwater fishes!"
4,Great Songwriting and Guitar Playing,"This album has a great combination of awesome lyrics and relaxing guitar tunes. This Cd makes me feel like I am in Spain again. The song ""No Hay Naa Mejor"" is set to become a classic."
4,tetra whisper filter,I was surprised that it works a little better than i thought it would it's perfect filter for a 10 gal. tank with a couple of fish.
3,GREAT while the WORK,"These are great while they work- I love that they take up a small footprint in the tank. I don't like that you can't add your own filter floss and charcoal- the disposable ones just don't have enough charcoal in them to be effective for long. These filters don't last long- 6 months to a year TOPS. So, I feel they should be cheaper.They are OK, I do LOVE the design and the fact that you can have them in a tank half full of water or use them in a bowl behind some rocks as a make-shift water fall inside a tank that I have terrascaped to look like a real mini piece of a woodland scene with moss and real plants, peatmoss under and a layer of charcoal then a layer of gravel- a tank set up like that will actually RAIN inside and it makes a great environment for tree frogs, lizards etc. I have a turtle for 15 years in this type of set up & a leopard frog lived for 7 years in one!"
5,Great purchase,"So far so good, this item does what it is supposed to. It is very quiet, glad I bought it."
3,It's an okay filter,"I had this filter with a 10 gallon tank about a month. So far, I'm still happy with it. The only thing I don't like about is suction that holds the filter is great but since there's nothing hanging on the side of the tank wall, it tilted when I open the cover. Nice thing is you can put it anywhere in the tank, but it's not stabilize. One of my small gold fish caught in the filter and die, but other fishes had no problem at all. It's quite, but sometimes I can still hear it night time, especially when I just arrive home. I'm a new habit with this fish thing, and I really can't tell if it's me over feeding that cause the death of my fishes or filter is not working well. So far, the water is still clear and I just did small water change one time over the month."
4,So far so good. Scrubber info lacking in my opinion,"Super quiet and seems to do the job. Setup was easy but the information on the bio-scrubber is weak and doesnt really show how/why this part is needed. Says it's to cultivate beneficial bacteria but it's just a series of plastic bristles as far as I can tell...unless the bristle structure helps in this regard? Not sure, just a guess."
2,Didn't even last a year,"I got this filter last December for a 10 gallon setup filled with minnows. It did a good job filtering until about June when it started to get finicky (I would have to unplug and replug a few times to get it working again). Then about two weeks ago it just gave up, outright.I gave it two stars because when it worked it did it's job. I'm just upset that it only worked properly for 6 months and then stopped working outright after 8 months."
3,has some design issues,"I like the amount of suction this filter provides - I can easily see junk being taken into the intake slots, and it is much better at this than my old Whisper power filter. What I don't like is just how much space it takes up in a 10 gallon tank. Expect it to occupy more real estate than what is desirable. But then again, that is something to automatically consider when buying a submersible power filter.I also do not like the way in which the water moves through the filter medium. The flow is so strong that it barely stays within the open-top compartment to move past the filter. I expect that when the filter becomes colonized with beneficial bacteria the water will flow over it or even up over the back lip, thus defeating the filter's purpose. Furthermore, the filter does not fit as snugly into the unit as I would have preferred. This allows some unfiltered water to flow around both sides of the filter."
3,Many of the other reviews for this item had me believe that it came with the aquarium as well,"and it did not so now i just have a filter and no tank. it said on many of the other review that it come with a light and a tank and the whole 9 to get all set up, those comments should be removed"
2,lasted a year...,It's been a year since I bought mine and it has done it's job till now but I don't think I'll be getting anymore Tetra products. The heater only lasted a month and this whisper filter a year. It sucked up one of my flatter fish a while ago but it is silent.
3,Its okay.,I bought this for my 10 gallon tank that is filled with only 5 gallons of water. I placed this in water that was 1 day old and it does a very mediocre of a job cleaning all the water. The water at the opposite side is still dirty. and it has a very loud hum and gives me a headache!! I tried all sorts of things to make the hum go away but it just doesnt. Only buy this if you keep your tank in a secluded area where you wont be bothered by a constant hum. I guess I got what i paid ten bucks for.
2,not very good,"i purchased this filter for my 6 gallon tank, i have 4 fish in it when i inserted the filter, worked beautifully, when i got up the next morning myfish was sucked into the vents on the outside, it died, same thing happened the next day. i would not recommend this for a tank any smaller than a 10 gallon tank, even then it sucks the fish up if they are an inch or so small. you need to partition the front vent, i put a small plastic plant in front of mine just to make the current a little less."
2,Never again.,"I've had this filter for over a year. Went looking for my betta fish tonight to feed him because he normally hides under his little ""barrel"" in the tank for a few days, got to looking at he was sucked to the bottom of the filter dead and brown as dirt. Wonderful. Don't buy this unless you want dead fish."
1,Does not do the job for tutles,"I have purchased two of these for my turtles tank. At first it seemed to be doing well and my turtle really like the water fall. After a week it was just humming and not filtering. Hubby got it to work again, but it was not filtering as good as it did the first week (I Replaced the carbon pad). On the third week it quit working all together.I thought it might be defective so I bout a new (same brand-type). Again worked okay for about a week and two weeks later this one quit working two. They just do not do the job for turtle tanks. Very disappointing product. I bought a fluval and love it!!!"
