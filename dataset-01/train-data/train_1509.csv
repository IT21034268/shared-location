2,Ending Ruins Entire Book,"Won't provide any spoilers, but the ending is unbelievable and provides an incredible let down. Story is intriguing to start with a madman on the loose and various players joining in to solve the mystery. But I wanted to throw the book through the window when I realized how the whole thing would end up. No pay-off - this book was a complete waste of my time."
3,Not Dekker's Best Work,"Ted Dekker is my absolute, favorite author-hands down. That said, of all the books he has written, ""Thr3e"" was probably my least favorite. I figured out the ""mystery"" a quarter of the way through, and that blew the novel for me. It was far too predictable-which is so unlike Ted. I don't get the hype for this book at all. If you're new to Dekker's work, I suggest letting this one go, and pick up the Circle trilogy or any one of the Martyr Series' books instead."
5,Outstanding Book!,This book took me thru a gamete of emotions & I would stay up late reading it. BUY ALL HIS BOOKS!!!!!!!
5,"""Three"" is my Second Ted Dekker","As a former Stephen King fan, I couldn't take the descriptive gore and depravity anymore. I picked up Dekker and Peretti's ""House"", and I was hooked.""Three"" is one of those can't-put-it-down page turners. It won't take long to read, because you can't stop once you start. I've already picked up Dekker's latest, ""Showdown"". Next in line for me is the ""Black"" trilogy.Anyway, ""Three"" and ""House"" are both being made into movies. With Dekker giving input and on the set, I hope we don't have any literary massacres, like Stephen King.""Three"" like ""House"", makes you think, without making it a chore. I don't give out the endings of books or movies, but you may see a little of yourself in the main characters. Or a lot."
5,Kept me on the Edge of my seat!,"You hardly get started in Thr3e before the action hits. From the beginning to the end you speculate on the outcome, but do not realize it until the very end. Ted Dekker writes in amazing detail and has a way of holding your attention with every word. You just can't stop!With Left Behind series still fresh in my mind, I thought that there would be obvious acts of God working within the characters, since this is a Christian based novel. To my surprise there was more in depth issues that are addressed pertaining to one's perception of life and moral issues as stated in the Bible. Ted Dekker gets you thinking about the perception of good against evil, and creates a suspenseful story that will keep you coming back for more.I can't wait for Dekker's trilogy Black, Red and White to be released next year!"
3,it was good but............,"Perhaps it was just me but I had a hard time with the ""Three"" concept. I really do not want to give any spoilers so I will say that I was just fine until the end."
3,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","This novel is interesting and intriguing, providing plenty of suspense and plot twists. However, the twists are somewhat predictable (and even telegraphed at times). The final conclusion of the book is likewise rather empty. The writer does little to deal with the deep philosophical issues raised throughout the story."
4,Thr3e,"Thr3e is a mystery and thriller with a quite a few plot twists that will make writing a review without giving things away. But I will try. Kevin Parsons, a 24-year-old seminary student gets a phone call while driving telling him that there is a bomb in his car and it will go off if he doesn't solve a riddle. He is now the victim of a tormentor named Slater. Soon the FBI is involved and this mystery takers off. Dekker writes a fast paced exciting story that had me guessing and questioning every step of the way!"
5,Who is REALLY Torturing Kevin Pasons?,"Kevin Parsons is studiously pursuing a degree in divinity when he becomes stalked by a demented purveyor of unmigated terror. Confused as to why he has been singled out as a target, Kevin reaches out to his only long term friend Samantha. Samantha and Jennifer from the FBI pursue the perpetrator of dismay to the shocking end.Once again Dekker does a masterful job forcing the reader to ponder what truly defines mental illness. Mr. Dekker leads you through a convoluted and stressful story of a tormented soul and who is really the tormentor. He keeps your attention throughout while forcing you to ponder the basic premises of good and evil and the dichotomy thusly illustrated. The characters are well portrayed and it is difficult not to sympathize with their frustrations. This is an excellent mystery and study of basic human nature.I highly recommend the book."
4,Thrill without chill !!!!!!!,"Ted dekker has written some great books but this is not one of his best works. Kevin gets a call from a guy called slater who tells him that if he doesn't answer the question, his car will blow off in 3 minutes. This is how the book began. The initial chapters of the book were well written and I was hooked to it, waiting for some action. With each page, the suspense use to grow and the plot goes on becoming complicated.What works against such a promosing book was the details and length of the arguments in the book. It is a well written book, but after finishing half the book, the interest starts drifting away. Even the end is a let down.The book definitely has some great moments but the chill is lost."
1,"""Hokey, boring, nonsense"". Just a few words that come to mind","Not a spoiler Review! Just my opinionThis is my first Ted Dekker book, and I did not enjoy it. Heard from some readers that it was a great book so decided to pick it up at the local library. I was very disappointed! Boring characters; unbelievable (and at times non-sensical) plot; and just plain hokey throughout."
1,A very poorly researched book,"Having read through a couple dozen reviews on this book I have to add one more because I so totally disagree with what has been written in them and am shocked that so few people realized that the ending of ""Three"" was so completely implausible. I don't want to give away the ending for those who are thinking of reading it, but if, unlike the author, you know something about what is revealed, well then you will regret having wasted your time reading the book. My advice to Dekker, were he to read this, would be that he needs to do better research or stick to what he knows. This book is a diservice to the public because it creates a false impression for the reader with regards to the issue that Dekker brings up."
4,Blew Me Away,"Meant to give it 4 1/2 stars. One of the best reads this summer, for me. I usually can guess an outcome but not in this one (although I can honestly say I figured it out close to the end right before the unveling). But I won't ruin the surprise ending. This book was well written and I literally did not want to put it down. If you like psychological and ""thinking"" thrillers, this one's for you."
2,"Ok, predictable and annoying",This book was just ok with some annoyingly predictable parts.**Spoiler**If you have seen movies like Fight Club or read other books with split personality characters you can start to tell who they are when no one talks to these people in the book/movie in person and only over the phone.Then to have one person with 3 personalities was just annoying especially when he had to shoot himself to get rid of them.
4,A good read,"Couldn't put it down. The writing is a little rough in places and the theology-philosophy obtrusive, but it's got a well-paced, gripping, unpredictable and unusual plot."
5,A must read for anyone interested in Dekker,"After reading The Circle Series, I decided to branch out and read Dekker's other works, starting with Thr3e. It did not disappoint! The story works well, Dekker did not incorporate an unnecessary or forced love story as he's done with some of his other thriller books, and that very fact helps it stand out among his best thrillers/mysteries. The twist at the end was unexpected, but a welcomed surprise. A movie with the same name was based off the book, but was so awful that I could not finish watching it. Don't bother with the movie, stick to the book on this one. Very enjoyable read and while there are some Dekker books I loathe, this is one of the few that I love."
5,Wow - what a fun ride!,"Who is Ted Dekker? I didn't even know about this author until I came across a bookstore display for ""Three"". I bought the book, and funny enough, finished it in 3 days.In 400 pages, the reader is thrust into the life of Kevin, an intelligent seminary student who finds himself suddenly being stalked and terrorized by a demented maniac bent on Kevin's destruction. Kevin's life and mysterious past are masterfully unfolded as the story continues to build the suspense and gain speed. This book pretty much has it all for those who want to read a good thriller: great character development, lots of suspense-dripped action, thought-proving moments and heck, even a little romance.I know this is being billed as a ""Christian Thriller"", but please don't mistake this as something like the ""Left Behind"" series. The writing is VASTLY better here and will have a much broader appeal to all suspense fans.So, who is Ted Dekker? Apparently, a great story teller."
4,A great psycological thriller with deep Christian themes.,"What sepparates good from evil? The answer to this question is explored excellently in this thriller by Ted Dekker. From start to finish, this story had me thinking hard about the questions it raised. Beyond the phillosophical questions, 'Three' brings up many Christian themes, including prayer. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great story with deep themes, shocking twists, and a surprising ending."
3,A Christian James Patterson?,"As a Christian, I really want to enjoy Ted Dekker's work. ""Three"" was my second Dekker novel. The book is about a seminary student who receives a call telling him to confess his sins to the world ""or else"". What follows is a strange, Patterson-like novel that has a weird ending. This is an ambigous review, but telling more might give away too much."
2,Mediocre at best.,"""Three"" aims to be suspenseful and insightful. It is neither. The plot is ill-contrived and bland. The characters are thin - you never come close to caring about any of them. It is in parts ridiculous. The ending has been done time and again. If you're a hardcore Ted Dekker fan, or if you're a suspense junkie not concerned with quality, dive right in. However, surely there must be better pieces of work out there."
1,Disturbing,"I finished reading the book, at first barely able to put it down since starting it last evening. The main reason I chose to read it was that it was listed as a Christian novel, which is what I prefer to read. I was disappointed when I discovered there was little that made it a Christian book, other than a few religious comments by the main character- who is a seminary student- and having a priest in it.I thought it was suspenseful and interesting in the beginning, but when certain things were revealed and hinted at, I had doubts about finishing the book. At times I felt like it was messing with my mind.I stuck with it to the end, but wish I would have passed on reading it altogether.I understand everyone has different tastes, so even though my opinion is less than favorable, you'll have to decide for yourself, because there are a lot of rave reviews for this book."
1,"OH, PL3ASE!!","Juvenile Writing.Shallow Characters.Predictable Plot.Surprise Ending.Three negatives.No wonder ""Christian"" writers have so little credibility.I'm going back to Dostoyevsky."
1,The Worst,"This has to be one of the worst books I've read in 40 years.It is incorrectly classified, and that should never be allowed.It is listed as a ""novel,"" but it is not; the end flaps seemto suggest it is a ""mystery,"" but that is so untrue, it's annoying.The story moves along at a medium pace, which is alright in itself, but as the end is approached, the whole tone switchesto some metaphysical or sci-fi context, and the ending isjust gibberish.It's a genuine waste of time to try this one. Details of thefirst 90% of this book are meaningless, because the endingis so off-base, and such a switch in tone, anyone interestedin that first part of the book will be disappointed in theending. A TV re-run is time better spent."
1,"Has anyone here seen the movie ""Adaptation"" ?","This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie. It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously. It's like Metallica releasing their black album. Hadn't they seen ""This is Spinal Tap"" ?"
3,I agree with the review below.,"This book is good, but it's not that good. It's a nice little time capsule. Someone who is not interested in turn of the century Paris or surrealism probably wouldn't enjoy it that much."
5,BALLLLLLLLINN!,"This figure is hot, it highlights Strahan sacking McNabb, which we were very capable of earlier in the season. today we need to be ballin again and put the eagles outta their misery. it would be hot if Mcfarlane put out action figures of the D Line in their jumpshot pose.we stay fly, no lie you know thisssssBALLLLLLIN!!!"
4,"Cool anime, lousy DVD","Outlaw Star is one of those animes that is cool from the first episode and doesn't stop. If you have the money, pick up this DVD. While it may seem pricey, you get your money's worth since there are fewer episodes on the VHS tapes. But what seems to be a pattern in anime DVDs is no special features. These two discs lack a lot in that area. Still the series is so cool it doesn't really matter. You can watch Outlaw Star on TV if you want see the inferior edited version."
4,Hey Traveller Fans!,"As others before have said: good plot, interesting characters, well animated, excellent charcater designs and music. One thing I will add is that if you have played Traveller or any of the other Sci-FI RPGs, you'll get a real kick out of this show. Isn't the first challenge of any champaign to steal a cool starship?"
3,Lost In A Sea Of Stars,"This is a very interesting anime series. It is not one of my favorite. i prefer magical situated story lines when it comes to anime. However, for some one who is really into science fiction will like it.There's lots of battles, star ships, guns, and a lot more other stuff. I thought the story lines could have been a little bit better.However, the animation really makes up for it."
2,Save your time.,"That about sums up this book. I borrowed it from a friend Saturday morning and after about 100 pages I had to skim the rest. The writing is forced and dry and the dialogue is just not realistic. Nothing grabs you and you don't care about the characters at all. When I skimmed to the end I found the denouement to be unsatisfying and my friend, who had read the whole thing agreed. Even though it is self printed (ALWAYS A RED FLAG FOLKS!!) I was interested because I try to read all books I come across by people from my home state but I am glad I didn't spend any money on this one.I give it two stars only because there are some moments of interest about the local area. The author should have tried a different title so as not to confuse readers who may come across the GREAT crime writer Joe Lansdale's ""Cold in July"" and there is one other book with this title too."

2,THEY CAN DO BETTER,"I've been a fan of America from the start. It was with great interest that I noticed One Way had just released four of America's albums from 1979-1984. I had missed this one when it came out and was eager to hear it. Silent Letter is interesting, but not one of America's better efforts. America appears to have been trying to change their sound (a big mistake). I'd vote ""All Night"" as their worst song ever! Buy this one only if you have to own every one of their albums."
3,Superior Production,"Their first studio album as a duo and their last collaboration with legendary Beatles producer, George Martin. I was disappointed when I first listened to this album when it came out in 1979. It sounded like they were trying too hard to make up for the loss of Dan Peek. Three songs were minor hits: Only Game In Town, All My Life, and All Around. Best album cuts are: And Forever, Foolin, and One Morning. Some tracks feature the Tower Of Power horn section. Martin does an excellent job with the production, as usual. This album has grown on me over the years, but still not one of my favorites."
5,It was just what I needed to read!,"I just finished this book and I have to say it was just what I needed. I was beginning to think there was something wrong with me or something because I really don't want to even date anyone or have sex with anyone because I want time for myself to pursue my goals. My husband died five years ago and I had to nurse him for the last three. It was very, very hard but now I feel like I am taking this breathing time just for me and it feels GOOD! This book is awesome, and so comforting. I'll use it now AND when I am ready to get back into dating. I told Oprah and Barbara Walters to have her on there shows. It is really good - if you are thinking of reading it do it!"
1,"oh, please!","This trite, poorly written book should have a sub-title: ""I aint gettin' any."" Not only did this book bore me but misinformed me as well. Women aren't ""forced"" by men to perform any act, including sexual ones, and as a woman I find the whole concept insulting. I, too, am single. Where I guess I differ from the author is that I'm not ""an average of 10 lbs. overweight,"" and I don't feel men will only be with me if I have sex with them. The women of the '90s are fortunately much more powerful than this author would have us think, and perhaps she may be dealing with issues herself. I certainly don't feel this book is any benefit to anyone."
1,The Cult Of Denial,"No where in this book is there advice for the woman who finds it difficult to resist sex do to actually wanting it...no help for the woman that thinks of sex as an equal pleasurable event... over and over again...the thyme is ""protecting your female emotions"" but wake up call!!..we are not all the same..we don't all want love, relationship or material objects for sex..we are facing very powerful desires which have nothing to do with the love and are based in attraction,just as men have..but few writers face this and write over and over about the ""vunerable female"" and the ""user male"" ...this book is not for you,if you want help dealing with overwhelming lust..because the undercurrent of the book is ""women are the objects"" and ""men are the preditors...no help for a sexual woman needing a little support,only the same old psychobable about women being vunerable and needy."
2,Nice try but misses the Misses,"Although the concept for the cause is a good idea, it sort of misses the mark. I think it just became a place to vent a bit for a series of would-be ""we-finally-got-religion"" writers. Nice try. A little lame."
1,Give me a break,"Maybe this book could have been written a little better, but it's not that it is just poorly presented; it seems to deal with some definite problems the author has deciding which way she should go. A better title would be ""My Turn In The Confessional"". Maybe she thinks that being a ""turn-around tramp previously looking for a 6 1/2"" prize can be quickly excused by shouting her reformation from the rooftops. While nothing may be worse than a born-again drunk, a ""born again virgin is rignt up there in the running. Out of 4 zillilion Mr. Wrongs there wasn't anybody up to her standards? Nobody went out of there way for her, was nice to her, wanted a relationship? C'mon. . Little Ms.""I'm too good for everybody"" should get a grip on life. I feel for her tragedies in her life, but for god's sake when you lay down with dogs you get up with fleas. What did she expect?"
2,Let's all gather down by the river....,"If you like AA meetings, revival meetings, or temperance society get togethers, you will love this book. Otherwise, don't bother. Might be a good book if your sexual desire is out of control. Not so good if you currently know where the on-off switch is. Not everybody wants to wallow together."
4,The REAL first appearance of Mewtwo.,"This video (from the second season of Pokémon), features Ash's attempt to win his eighth badge, The Earth Badge in his attempt to enter the Pokémon League! Most memorable for the battle at Viridian City's Gym, where Mewtwo makes his premiere appearance (under a mask and suit of armor, that is.) However, Giovanni is forced to leave the gym in the hands of Jesse, James, and Meowth, so it's fairly obvious what happens. Typical Pokémon antics, and great fun for kids or even older fans."
3,In the Bathroom,"The toilet paper holder is very nice looking. I bought three of them because of their simplicity. Because the base is so light, they are always tipping over. I think they should have a heavier base for better control when pulling the paper."
2,"too lightweight, it moves around.","We have bought many items from this dist. of Amish products, all high quality items. This one we are not crazy about. It is too lightweight and moves around on the floor. The return shipping does not allow us to ship it back. Not real happy with this purchase. I am sure it is better than the ones bought at say a Target, but it does not work for us."
1,Waste of 3 gift certificates,I was sent a very nice wireless mouse. You have to have a CD to install this on your computer. I was unfortunately sent the wrong CD. I have been all over trying to find the correct CD. I have to buy the Wireless Mouse to get the CD that comes with it. With shipping this cost me around $25. Thanks for nothing.
2,wireless mouse,"this item worked properly when i installed it, but by the second day it would not work at all, even when i reinstalled the software that came with this item."
5,I LOVE This Mouse!!!,"Wow, another great piece of hardware by Microsoft, you cannot go wrong if you pick up this wireless mouse. Signal is strong, the mouse is very comfortable to use for hours upon hours, and the setup was a breeze. Yes, Logitech makes some nice keyboard/mice, but I always seem to prefer Microsoft's stuff. I don't want to support Microsoft but I find their hardware to be more comfortable and better design goes into their products. You will not be disappointed if you pick up this mouse!!!***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,The perfect mouse?,"Well, maybe not perfect, but as close as I've even come. I've never had a mouse feel this right in my hand. Very smooth action and the perfect weight. The only negative thing I could say about it is that since it is USB it is not immediately recognizable in DOS, but there are way around that."
2,Poor quality,The sponge smells like some sort of chemical was used on it. The hand massage tool is indented and the prongs don't stick out. The bath salt smells just as bad as the sponge. I am honestly thinking about just throwing away a majority of this product and buying everything locally. Every single item in the basket is manufactured in China and I honestly could have found better items elsewhere.
4,Nice presentation,"This is a good product, reasonably priced, as one of those gifts for someone difficult to buy for."
4,Best Bath Gift for the Price,"For $40, your wife or partner will love it!To be honest, it's not the best quality bath basket you can buy, but my wife loved it!The massaging scrub, loufa and basket are built well enough to be used again. And the ginger therapy scent is something that any woman can appreciate."
4,great film about twin sisters,"This is an excellent film set in the 1940s about twin sisters who are separated when they are young, one is adopted by a wealthy family in Holland, the other by a poor Catholic farmer in Germany. The film shows the different trajectories the girls' lives take based on their upbringing. The women meet up as adults and discover why they have not spoken in years. Overall it's an excellent film about WWII which examines the personal impact of the war."
4,good unit,"This is a good unit. I do wish that it had a little finer manual focus, and it doesn't work very well with 1.4 Ramron multiplier. All in all, I like this lens."
2,Not what they say it is,Before ordering this lens I read very carefully all the descriptions and it just wont do what they say it does. For an amateur like mewas very dissapointing to try to get pictures of birds and not get what they said I would with this lens. Tried it a few times and returned it.
5,Must read for every baseball fan!,"I first read this long ago, and needed to replace my lost copy. It is a must-read for every baseball fan, and the perfect start to the summer season! Go Mundys!!"
4,Amusing and Entertaining,"Whatever else this novel is, it IS NOT the ""Great American Novel"". Such a thing, of course, will never exist except in the minds of those who are completely ignorant of writing. What the novel purports to be is a novel about the ""Great American Novel"", written by one Word Smith (or Smitty). Smitty sets out to tell the tale of the forgotten Patriot League, and the final inglorious season of the Ruppert Mundys. As the other reviewers have noted, this is high farce - sometimes too broad, sometimes too cruel, but often hilarious. I can't quite recommend this as highly as some of the others (for the record, I am not a baseball fan and I think it definitely would be funnier if I were). However, there is enough talented wordplay for me to give this four stars. Not Roth's best, but far from his worst."
4,"Read this if you love ""A Confederacy of Dunces"".","Roth's ribald rearrangement of American baseball history (as told by an alliterating retired sportswriter, Word Smith, who opens his narrative with the majestic phrase, ""Call me Smitty"") sets the record straight with respect to the suppressed history of the third professional baseball league, the Patriot League, which flourished from 1898 to 1945. This is a book ""about"" baseball, America, and ""Literatoor"" which, like John Kennedy Toole's wonderful book, frequently provokes the reader to laugh out loud. I would rate ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" to be a superior work, but I also think that those who enjoy the travails of Ignatius J. Reilly will equally enjoy the story of the pathetically decrepit Ruppert Mundys."
4,It is amusing!,"To be perfectly honest, I was a bit disappointed when this came in the mail, because it was the subtitled edition. Yeah, Ranma 1/2's dub is actually good (except for the very beginning, that stunk)! Plus, I find the dub to be a bit funnier. However, this is still great, and is worth getting.Basically, Ryoga gets a mark on his stomach that makes him the ""Strongest Man on Earth"". However, the mark...is one of the most laughable things I have ever seen. As a result, Ryoga wants Ranma to beat him in order to get the mark off. It gets insane, like most Ranma episodes do.Overall, this tape is worth getting as it will provide plenty of laughs!"
4,Good,"This is a good gate. I dont like it as much as the gate at the top of my stairs bc this doesnt close automatically. Its very easy to install & easy to use, once you get used to it. This is a good buy."
2,Pain in the butt to install,We first ordered the gate based on the photo that was shown because it was exactly what we had. I soon realized that an extension kit was required AND special spindal clamp. It took my husband and his friend 45 minutes to install the gate. I'm not sure I would purchase this again but there really aren't too many options for bottom of the stairs.
2,a big let down from the first,I am a huge fan of the first video. This one however was a big letdown. Neither of my daughters will pay attention to it. It is unclear what they are signing some times too. Over all I just wouldn't recommend this at all.
3,Eh...,"The product was shipped quickly and arrived as advertised. However, as far as the content is concerned this feels like a bad first draft. There is some really good information but just getting through the first 20 minutes will be tough for anyone. Unnecessary repetition and long drawn out sections on simplistic concepts (i.e. a 4x's slow downed section of Sammy hitting a dummy over and over ad nauseam). For the novice of the kubotan there is a nice amount of techniques here, the presentation is just poor and leaves much to be desired."
5,Real world Self Defense,"In the real world, you are not going to overpower and outstrike everyone. this is where the Kubotan & Yawaras DVd comes in. Mr. Franco delivers again with real world self defense that anyone can deploy. Excellent DVD."
3,good but not great,"I researched a lot for strollers before I bought one, and I don't know if my prefered stroller yet exists, but this one has brought disappointment. I particularly dislike the basket set up. It is too difficult to access. Also, the wheels are better than cheaper stollers, but I wish they were rubber rather than plastic, because it doesn't take the bumps as smoothly as I would like. I do like how easily it folds, though not as compactly as I had hoped--it won't fit well into my sedan's trunk. I love the handle and the way I can put my son in any weather and not worry about him getting wet or cold. Most days I absolutely love it-as long as I don't need to bring a drink or any bags.Boston, MA"
5,Great budget nozzle,Light weight yet sturdy. Came with a washer so it does not leak. Have had it for about a month and use it daily to hose off dog run. Would buy again. What else can you say about a nozzle? As always Amazon rocks.
2,"Good information, but does not play on regular DVD players.","There's alot of good information here, but I had to install 2 programs from the CD-disk to get it to work on my computer.There are 4 lectures on the disk, each about a half hour long.However, the 2 programs that were on the CD to make the disk play....they don't have a pause, FF or rewind function. You start it up and hope you don't get interrupted. If you have to stop it for any reason, you have to restart the CD from the beginning of each lecture.I find it terribly misleading to call this a DVD and then on the back of the DVD have a place that gives you a minimum operating and computer system requirement.It will not play on ANY of the DVD players I have in my house. It will not play on my X-Box or Playstation platforms either. I find that to be really off-putting and probably would not have purchashed it had I known ahead of time."
1,DVD doesn't work,"I cannot get the DVD to play on my brand new iMac (Lion 2011) or our DVD player. I can view the pdf files, but not the DVD. I guess I will be returning it.. bummer!"
4,"Thoughtful, thorough, but arid.","An excellent, thoughtful work for the serious student or researcher. Gallegher seems to have made something of a cottage industry of these edited collections of late, but he does it well. Probably not of much use, however, unless one has a good overall view of the second day, for which I'd recommend Pfanz's work."
2,Ugh....So Bad,"The animation is VERY cheap, the main character whines constantly until you just wish she would die, and there are probably only 3 or 4 good laughts on this DVD. Somehow, I think this series could have been good, but it just isn't. The voice actress who plays Nanako is just plain annoying. If you're looking for fan service, you'll find some, although not much. Don't buy this DVD, maybe rent it."
2,Not what I expected,"True I should have figured that the show was not going to be that great by the other reviews, but there was nearly no character development at all. It was also hard to figure out why any of the c haracters were there unless you went and researched the series online. Not one of pioneer's better works."
2,Fluff film,"A fluff film, get it if you like background noise while you work, or unnaturally bouncy anime breasts; besides that this series has little to offer."
4,A Cute Little Book,"Like Sophia's other books, this is a really cute book. Everything is easy and there are many little specific spells to get what you want, for example to get scholarship or grant money. The book is funny and cute, and although these books always say they are for entertainment, Who Knows?!"
5,outside light lense,Fit great and looks great! Easy to install with one phillips screwdrivwer Wish I had checked Amazon sooner. I looked for a long time before finding just the lense.
4,Refractor replacement,Have a 150 watt HPS light. The lens globe cracked due to metal fatigue from wind load. This product was an economical repair. It is 2 inches smaller in diameter than the original globe. Still utilized the hole spacing and covered the electrical part.
2,Look elsewhere,"Decent sound, but CD stopped working shortlyafter warranty was up.Same thing happened to previous Zenith model."
1,BIG FAT ZERO!,"I started using this several years ago, and of course, have had to manually re-write the HTML to make it work correctly. It CRASHES so MUCH, that It's not worth it. It's very frustrating, and completely undependable, and has been for many years. I think the developers are REALLY low class for creating such a piece of garbage and releasing it that way. How hard can it be to build a software that doesn't crash so much?? This is the only program I've had continuous and varied crash problems."
3,Backpack backpack,"This is a sturdy backpack that came larger than I anticipated. However, my four-year-old daughter seems to be managing it with some ease. It includes a cute wallet that's attached to the zipper. My only gripe was that it is advertised as pink. And, well, it arrived in BLUE with a note that they needed to substitute the color. Too bad they didn't inform me of the switch before they decided to send it. That's bad business."
4,only used short time,rating as such since i have only used a short time. I like the shampoo and conditioner. have to see how the scalp treatment works over time.
1,Nioxin not good!,"I am not happy with this product. It makes my hair feel thin and it is too soft to style. It also makes my scalp itch very, very badly. I haven't used it long enough to know if it will make my hair appear thicker. I doubt it since the first few washes made it feel very thin and fly away. I am going to return it."
5,War - Platinum Jazz Review,"I was only 6 years old when this album was made. I just discovered it in my 30's. I feel like I have good music taste. I listen to Rock, Jazz, Rap, Funk, Alternative, Classic Rock, R&B.. you name it. This album slid into my everyday listening (at night) like it was nothing. Really great. Really Raw. It moves like a burning cigarette its so smooth. It sounds almost like the band is set up in your living room it has so much soul. It doesn't sound current, but a glass of wine at night and this record go together so well you may think you're hangin out in a Lounge in Philly in the 70's. If you like funk, soul or jazz, this album is a Must Have."
5,Superb Album by the Masters of the Game,"Yes, When they say it is platinum, that is what it is. Gumbo of Jazz, Funk, and soul in the way that only this Band could it. If you like War's music, get this one before it is too late."
5,Just what we needed!,"We bought a 1971 Ford Ltd, so we needed a good manual for it. This bookis just what we needed! Thanks to Amazon.com, we found this book, and keep itwith the car."
3,almost a good thing,"As a big fan of happy hardcore I would have to say this is a mediocre mix of happy hardcore songs. If you want a very good mix of happy hardcore try the ""happy 2b hardcore"" or possibly try any cd by Dj Anabolic Frolic. An amazing happy hardcore Dj."
3,not a toy,"The pillow was way smaller than I thought it would be, so it just sits on top of the sofa."
2,What happened to big bands?,"This is pretty sad. The band isn't tight, doesn't swing, and the arrangements are mediocre college level. Even the solos don't go anywhere. This band's got possibilities, but a long way to go before it becomes top-notch."
5,The best show ever,"Homicide was and is the best show ever aired on US television. Even with the more pedestrian seventh season, Homicide was a cut above the rest. The show was criminally ignored, barely escaped cancelation several times and was given a bad time slot, but still it survived on the quality of acting and writing in it. What other show has had guest stars such as Robin Williams, Steve Buschemi, Lily Tomlin and James Earl Jones?This box set puts together three of the best episodes of a wonderful series. Gone For Goode introduces us to the detectives, Every Mother's Son is heartbreaking and wonderfully acted with some of the most moving scenes done by extras and A Doll's Eyes, another sad yet brilliant episode.Catch it on CourtTV, it is worth watching."
3,Okay...,"I like all the Gundam Wing things, it's just that this is cut, so I don't see blood spreading out from Heero's head, or the trickle that's supposed to be on his face. Just kind of annoys me... Where can I buy the uncut one..."
4,Mobile Suit Gundam Wing -Cold Battlefield,"To begin with Gundam Wing is a good series. This third videotape in the series only adds to the story line. Of course you must get the other two first. This one has the climax of the battles with the Gundams and Oz. The three episodes bring about the supposed demise of Heero pilot of Wing Gundam, and adds to the plot line. What are the pilots fighting for now? That is what the viewer will ask when they get to this tape. This is a great video, but even better uncut, that is if you like all the nitty grity. The lack of explicit lines and perhaps bloodshed in this video does not take away from its glory however. If you love Gundam Wing as much as I, you might wanna look into this one."
5,Gundams are on Earth!,"Another 5 great episodes of Gundam Wing. The year is After Colony 195 and Gundam Wing is just starting to get hot!EPISODE 11: THE WHEREABOUTS OF HAPPINESSEPISODE 12: BEWILDERED SOLDIERSEPISODE 13: CATHERINE'S TEARSEPISODE 14: THE ORDER TO DESTROY 01EPISODE 15: TO THE BATTLEGROUND - ANTARCTICAThis DVD covers the time frame where the Gundams are in hiding after Lady Une has used the colonies as hostage.Wufei meets Sally Po,Trowa heads for his final battle,Heero tries to make up for his mistake of killing the honorable leader Noventa, pacifist of the former Alliance, To episode 15 where Hero and Trowa head to Antartica to finish the fight with Zechs. This is the best earth based fight between the Tallgeese and Wing Gundam! A definate must have."
4,Quite interesting...,This book looks quite interesting and helpful though I have yet to implement the techniques mentioned. All you need is a little more time to digest the ideas in it.
2,Needed tweaking,This bracket did not fit my 2004 ford explorer until it was tweaked. I had to use a knife and a dremel tool.
5,Very pleased with purchase.,"This memory card functions well with my Olympus Camedia D-360L camera, and allows about 300 High Quality pictures on one 64MB card. This type of memory card, however, has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and is somewhat difficult to find."
3,Only a piece of hair extention glows in the dark,"There wasn't much product description / details on this barbie doll, so I thought the outfit would glow in the dark. After receiving it, found that only the hair extention clipped to the hair glows! Well, I guess this is a case where the product just didn't meet my expectation and the feature is the only reason for my purchase as we have already many Barbies at home."
4,Good Cd,"As one reviewer said The Undergroud Series is way better. For one the dance track on the Underground Series is far better than the Dance tracks on this album, but don't think this Cd has nothing going for it... For one this 1st Cd is mainly dance music, while the 2nd is mainly trance with a little dance vide thrown in, so I enjoyed the CD 2 more(I happen to be a trance lover), but first Cd could do without these tracks numbers: 7, 9 and 12... Those maybe good to others but they don't cut it for me and who knows probably Ultra Dance 4 will be mixed by DJ Encore & Johnny Vicious since each has mixed one version already(Johnny Vicious also mixed Ultra Dance 1)and maybe that time this series will be able to match up to the Underground Party series...All in all is a great album to have..."
2,A big let down!,"I bought this CD a while back and it was a complete let down from what I thought it would be. The commercials made it look so good and made it sound really good. The commercials depicted at least 45 seconds of good music from the CD, and that is about all I found. On both CDs combined there are like 2 songs that are OK. I bought the CD, walked out to my car, popped it in, and listened. An hour later I got out of my car and took the CD back(or tried to really). Now the only thing I use the CD for is to watch the little movie clip of the HOT girl on the second CD. All in all, a big let down!"
5,A really insightful book,"This is a wonderful book that I wish had been available when I was a student. There are things here that I have never seen anywhere else. Reading it one understands National Socialism much better. In particular the fact that the Nazis hated ""Jewish-Christianity"" which they saw as a form of ""cultural imperialism"" was a real insight to me. I strongly recommend this book to anyone intersted in the history of the twentieth century, cults and new religions, or the way politicians create and manipulate propaganda."
5,This lampm is beautiful and coodrinates lovely with the bedding set.,I love this lamp. It's gorgeous. I purchased it for my granddaughter. It goes beautifully with the bedding set for the crib.
5,Absolutely fantastic,"Each one of the stories were delightful. My favorite was ""Double Cross."" It was a fun book to read.Caught me up in the Stanford life, and felt like I was one of the family. Each book is about 89 pages, but the story is full, family is carried over to the next story, but a different family member as the focal point. So it makes it like a longer story. Yet each story is totally complete in itself."
2,"Not ""The Story of Iggy"" but a critical take...","...and a rather sad one at that. The other reviewers with low rankings have it pretty much correct. Nothing wrong with a critical view on a subject at book length, but to mix a lot of interesting history with comments like Patti Smith and Iggy Pop throwing away songs that were better than Kurt Cobain's best is almost enough to make one stop reading (but that's 25 pages from the end, so let's perserve on, shall we?). Somebody needs to do this right, but ya know? Just listen to first three Stooges records and ignore books like this or the ""autobiography""."
2,fire the editors...,"... it is somewhat useful, if totally annoying, to have all this info in one book. Use the bibilography as a shopping list; buy all the source books and you'll be better off."
2,A bit disappointed,"This book was published in 2002, which was before the reuion of the Stooges (Iggy, The Astons, & Watt). So a lot of the writers opinions are irrelevant. It's almost like the author didn't l;ike Iggy, and Ig apparantly had no input on this book. Learned a few things, like some albums I didn't know about, but otherwise dissapointing."
4,Linked at the heart,The glasses were wonderful! I was very pleased with them and I cant wait to use them!
4,Find that substitute for an old tube,This is a fine book to help locate a substitute for an old tube for which you have no replacement.
2,No where near as good as the other Disney business books,"For $20.00, just the size of the book is disappointing. Barely 100 pages of content, I find the content to be insubstantial, especially compared to all of the other Disney business books that were available. This one seemed to be written by a ""wanna be"" author expert of Disney. I found nothing compelling or noteworthy in this authors book."
2,Not a Disney Book,"This is not a bad book, but it is not a Disney book. The author takes his love of Disney and applies his own ""make a list"" philosophy of business success. He does not show how Disney became a success. I found this to be a run-of-the mill ""positive thinking"" book. It basically says, make a list of what you want to accomplish and that will get you there. Nowhere in the books about Walt or Roy that I have read have I seen any mention of them making lists and then visualizing their way to success. I would skip this one for a better Disney book."
2,Too tight!,"The hat is very tightly knitted. The knit reminds me of stuff I produced when I was a kid learing to knit. It sat on my head like a kids' party hat. when I contacted the seller and made these comments, they rather curtly replied that the knitters are ""professionals"" and the hat fits as it should. I had a hat like this, which I lost, and it was stretchy and fit fine. Unless your head is very tiny, I do not recommend buying this product."
4,A good basic cartridge.,This is an older cartridge and so therefore it in some ways is a lot more basic. But don't let this stop you from buying it. There are lots of flowers and little critters. It is a nice cart to go back to again and again. The cuts don't have many layers and cut well. It is a great first cartridge to start with as you get used to using the machine.
4,Walk in my Garden Cricut,Love these the possiblities for making so many cards and scrapbook pages is endless!The images are crisp and the instructions for use are easily available on line. The quick start projects are fun to put together!
5,Plenty of Flowers!,All I can say is that I simply LOVE this cartridge and have probally used it more than any other cartridges I own. This cartridge offers alot of flowers and I have a lot of uses for flowers! I would recoomend this cartridge to anyone who likes to add flowers to thier projects. 2 Thumbs up!
4,Good collection of militaristic David Drake short stories,"This is a good collection of militaristic David Drake short stories. Most of the stories were written in the 90's, and most of them (but not all) are future science fiction.The first three stories are about THE FLEET, and cover the exploits of a company of Space Marines, who go on a lot of interdiction missions, and none of which expect to die of old age.The middle of the book contains a wide variety of different shorter stories, most of which are memorable.The last three stories are about a futuristic 22nd century cop ""from the south"", who lives in a world where cameras are as common place as in Orwell's 1984... but with super recording and playback + computer search technology that Orwell couldn't even have begun to imagine."
3,Non Fiction,"Interpreting Probability Models : Logit, Probit, and Other Generalized Linear Models by Tim Liao is a quite useful little text. It is pretty clear, and the examples are good and well constructed enough to give you some definite guidance on how to go about this.Definitely worth a look for those needing info on the topic."
3,Disappointing,"How I wish I'd read ""St. Chris"" review here before buying Myst ME! I agree with him/her completely. My big disappointment was the sound, too. I played the original Myst on Macintosh a few years ago -- I just finished Myst ME on my new Mac G4. The sound isn't as good as the original -- it's always at the same level and blasting. But most disappointing of all is the shortened music! Half of Myst's orginal haunting appeal was the soundtrack! If you've got a high-powered Mac, pass on Myst ME -- and pray that Disney doesn't screw up Myst III: Exile for Mac players."
4,Great Spawn game!,"This game is great for spawn fans or just for people who like action games. The graphics are alright for gameboy. also the music in the game is great and classic. there isn't much of a storyline to the game though which kinda sucks but overall i think the game was worth the money i bought it for. some of the things you can do in the game are pretty cool because on one of the levels you get to ride a motorcycle! Also they include characters from the spawn comics like clown, tremor, and overtkill and there are other characters in there. the game is a little bit easy but you can set the difficultys back and forth. Also the voices in the game are awesome. gameplay is very easy but once again just set the difficulties back and forth. i only gave this game four stars because there wasn't a storyline like i said and there are only 4 stages with 2 bosses in each i think. well overall it's a good game and there is a cheat menu if you wanna cheat."
3,Decent platformer,"Spawn is a pretty good old school platform game,for the gameboy color.The gameplay,graphics and sound are pretty good.There are four levels total.You fight through junkies,bikers,pimps,hookers,robots and some of Spawn's main villains that are bosses.In level 2,you get to ride a motorcycle.You can also get guns as well.This game is not great...but still pretty good.I do recommend it though to Spawn fans or for those who like old school platformers."
2,Wow! A basic book for absolute beginners...,"The cover image is poor and a reflection of the mediocre contents. The title is a misnomer, as the author advises the reader to hire a designer. This is a very basic general overview of trade shows. Also, it is almost entirely focused on trade shows related to selling products."
2,they don't squirt,I really thought this would be fun for bath time but they don't squirt. They have other uses though ... teaching him the animals and I use them at play time especially when I have the old mac donald cd on.
1,Not safe - Paint came off immedeately,"We got these for our 6 month old to play with during bath time. I boiled them to sterilize (which you should be able to do with toys that will end up in your baby's mouth), but the paint started rubbing off from one toy onto the other. Don't see a need for extra paint on a toy that will be chewed on. Will not give these to my daughter as she would get toxic paint in her mouth."
3,Would Recommend,"These are ok for the price they should have made them textured so their a little different than just in appearance, my son isn't too interested in them."
2,Fun but gross,My 2 year old loves these toys. But the gunk that accumulates inside them is disgusting. She plays with it and it gets sprayed all over the inside of the tub if i don't squirt it out first. So i'd recommend hot gluing the hole shut to avoid this problem...
5,cant get enough,i think this is a great gift for a baby shower. it's a unisex gift and i want one for myself even though i dont have any kids.thanks
2,Missing animals and duplicates of others,"Please be careful. I ordered this item, my Grandson just arrived and I got them out. I never thought that they would give me duplicates of animals. It shows the animals you get and I got two of the hippo and no cow. Of course, at home his cow is his favorite and well as the Penquin as they are black and white. He identied with them early and the black and white contrast for infants is really important. Good lesson - don't just make sure you got it or it works, look for duplicates and same colors. A real disappointment."
5,Awesome bath toys!,"My son loves these toys, they are his favorite bath toys. We've used them to help him learn all of the animals names and what sounds they make. I haven't had any problems with any color coming off or anything and I've used them almost every day for over a year. I'm only getting more now because you kind of have to replace bath toys after a while."
5,One of THE best purchases we made for our daughter!,"Our daughter has been using these for the last two years now! She loves to take them into the tub, the pool, and just play with them. She is four now and hasn't tired of them at all!!!"
3,BABY DOESN'T SEEM TOO INTERESTED IN THESE,"My baby (10.5 months old) doesn't seem to interested in these yet, and they seem pretty expensive for what you get, but they're alright I guess ... don't think I'd buy them if I had it to do all over again. Maybe he'll like them later??"
1,unsanitary mold incubators.,"These are very cute and my daughter loves playing with them. She has always loved chewing on the octopus. I had no problem with these until I kept finding this long stringy goo in the tub with her. It went on for weeks until I saw it oozing out of the holes in these toys! I squirt all the water out after each bath, but it stays just moist enough to grow mold--or something slimy, brown, and gross!!! I shudder to think about all the times my baby put these in her mouth!"
2,paint comes off,"These are so cute and my 11mo daughter loves to play with them. We have never put them in the tub because I read about mildew build-up inside them. But they are cute and she loves to play with them anyway.The problem is she is still a mouthing baby and puts these little critters in her mouth. We have only owned them for about a month. The paint is coming off the sheep's face, which she likes to suck on. The raccoon is loosing his paint, and he hasn't even been played and that started happening right out of the bag. The cow looks like the paint has rubbed off in some spots too.I tried looking online to see what kind of paint it is, as sometimes they are waterbased and non-toxic, however I can't imagine that a company would use waterbased paint on a bath toy.They sure are cute though. Maybe the company can address the issue with the paint coming off. Until then, it would probably be advisable to save your money and find a safer product for your little one."
2,Disappointed,"I didn't expect such a tiny sized collection. I would have expected to find these at the Dollar Store or equivalent. It's too much bother to return them, but I would never have paid $10 for these in the store. They are cute - just a little disappointing."
3,Bath Time,"Too expensiv, but it's for my 1 year old boy what can I do? Cute items I love'em! I would recommend it for any baby who loves bath time."
2,Cute but unsanitary,My 14 month old likes these but they are unsanitary. No matter how well I empty them of water after each bath they still grow mold inside them. You go to squirt them and black gunk comes out. I'm going to get rid of these and find other bath toys that are easier to keep clean
5,Fun bath toys,We received this as a gift at my baby shower and I was eager to use them. We first brought them out when my daughter was about 5 months old and she loves them! We still use them during bathtime (she is almost 11 months) and also have a few out on her play area since she likes chewing on them. She giggles when I squirt her with them and likes the bright colors. Good product for a reasonable price - highly recommended.
3,Cute but a little concerning,"These are attractive looking toys, to us and our little one. We have had these since she was a month old but she only started to use them frequently at about 6 months. Even though we empty them of water as best we can after every use we still find that gunky stuff is squirted out every now and again - yuk. Also, about a month ago (10 months old) she was sucking on the dolphin and I noticed a black spot on her chin. It turned out to be an eye from the dolphin (the paint). I'm not comfortable with using these any more and will look for other bath toys. These may be fine for older kids that don't put everything in their mouths but the gunky stuff is still icky."
3,Slight but interesting,"""The Ancient Hawaiians"" is little more than a tourist pamphlet about how the Hawaiians dressed before the white man came. A young schoolchild interested in cultural history, but there's not enough information to satisfy an adult attempting to research the subject. On the plus side, the ink drawing illustrations were very clear, and there is a good illustrated description of how to tie a loincloth. Overall, I'm not sorry to have a copy, but if I had known in advance what to expect I probably would not have bothered to buy it."
4,"Fun, but short. Watch out for higher-level enemies...","The first Naruto game i played. and overall, a very fun game. i'd seen a few episodes, and then to play out those events, was cool. but i think the game ended too soon. maybe adding more episodes and more side quests would have made it better. learning to fight is pretty difficult too! the AI controlling your enemies is pro, and without some practice, you'll be more aggravated than a baby without a teet."
4,fun game but kinda quick,i recently purchased my xbox and i bought this game on amazon... but this game is pretty quick... the missions werent that hard and i beat the game pretty quickly... it was fun while it lasted!
4,Great Game,"I really like this game, there are a lot of different types of mini-games packed into it, although tedious at times, can be pretty fun. The gameplay and controls itself are pretty cool I really liked how they make Naruto move in the game with the sprinting and sprint jumps he's able to acquire pretty early on in the game. The fighting parts of the game are alright too, although I wouldnt say anything new really, pretty basic in that department. The way to initiate jutsu's is cool and the overall graphics of the game arent too bad, reminds me of those DBZ Budokai games mixed with RPG."
3,"Pretty fun, definitely entertaining!","Got this as a gift for someone, who said it was pretty fun though a little repetitive at times. Pick up coins...deliver ramen...pick up coins...deliver ramen...hear annoying voice...pick up coins...sexy jutsu. But that it was definitely a much better game than he had expected."
5,GT-TTime81WuzHere This game is perfect,"I fell in love with the anime series as a whole and regret I havent been able to keep up with shippudden like how I want to since my soul destroying occupies all of my time. This game will always be a 10/10 and 5/5 stars because it captures the anime so well and makes me want to buy the anime series just to watch the episodes that were so perfect,everything is perfect and I love how people still play this game online."
3,Moving Day,It was about a bear family loving where they live including their friends and home. But the soil for growing vegetables was hard and rocky so they decided to move well papa and mama bear. When they found a place to move it needed a little bit of work but they managed what it would look like and they got new friends and a new home and a new place to grow vegetables. It was a very good book and I would read it again if I had to but its not something I would read again by choice. It teaches kids what ever you do something good will come of it eventually.ages 3-8
2,"so what does ""mal"" mean again?","music to shrug to.nothing wrong with this really, but for all the hype around it, i expected better (i probably trust pitchforkmedia a little too much). it's just standard guitar pop with a, um, oh yeah, ""rough edge"". i dunno. the lyrics are supposed to be pretty great, but if the music doesn't pull me in, the lyrics won't either. and plus, when i got this one in the mail, i discovered it was just a promo copy, with no liner notes or anything, and that pissed me off."
5,5 stars,"I bought it at Friday sale, It is so beautiful like the picture, very big size, shining. I love it very much. I will give it 5 stars."
5,aragamilk,I have used this product for years after about 6 months of purple up the switch to this helps even out your ph and is a necessity for any reef that has been set up for more than 6 months. i would also say to use this product if you have sps corals.
4,Great price and expeditious delivery!,"I ordered an old Greek Lexicon published in 1963. The book is in great condition as described by the seller, a reasonable price, and fast delivery! thanks so much!"
4,Great value for money.,I bought these shoes for hiking in Alaska. Loved the firm grip of it. It felt very sturdy. I have soft ankles and still I could hike without any worries. Recommend it.
4,pleased customer,"The hiking boots were sized a little wide but other than that they are of a quality represented at the site. The ""in stock"" statement at the website when they were ordered was not correct. It took weeks to get them, obviously becausse they were NOT ""in stock"". Other than that I was pleased."
3,"Decent book, a little dated.","This would be a good book for beginners. It's a little dated & once you've seen one book like this, you've pretty much seen them all!I would recommend Encyclopedia of Scrapbooking by Creating Keepsakes... It's got more updated techniques & lots of them!"
3,Good,It's an excellent book for those who are ready to begin scrapbooking or cardmaking. It will save money when you go to store to make your first purchases.
5,NECESSITY,"Whether you scrapbook, make cards, or do any type of art, this book provides endless techniques and eye candy to tantalize you. Every time I pick it up, there are still techniques I haven't tried yet!!! If you only buy one book, THIS ONE IS IT!!!!"
2,Out dated,"This book gives you ideas, but it's outdated. They need to update the techniques and materials"
1,"Belitt doesn't translate, he makes his own poems, and all Pablo's magic is gone","I bought this after reading some of Copper Canyon's books of Neruda's posthumous poetry. I'm fluent in Spanish, but can't find the books without translations here in the States. Simply put, while I loved Pablo's original words in this collection, it was anguishing to read these ""translations,"" as they are more adaptations then anything else, and all of the original beauty and crystal poetic craft is lost. I'm going with the rest of Copper Canyon's series, I suggest you do the same."
1,"Great originals; Ugly, dead translations","Angelica, another reviewer speaks for me as well: while I loved Pablo's original words in this collection, it was anguishing to read these ""translations,"" as they are more adaptations then anything else, and all of the original beauty and crystal poetic craft is lost.Yes ANGUISHING. The translator has molested Neruda's work, and smeared it with his ego. Why presses pay self-inflated bunglers to translate literary treasures defies me.Buy The Essential Neruda instead--those translators obviously care about honest, faithful transmission, which is not the case here."
3,Disappointing - Very Little Action,"I have to say I was disappointed with this Nam novel after the big build up it had from previous reviewers. In its 610 pages there is very little action, and half of it is in the last 10 pages. If you are looking for firefights with the enemy, this isn't the book to read. It reminds me much more of The 13th Valley than Fields of Fire. This is the story of Marines stationed near An Hoa and the dreaded Arizona territory. Most of the book is devoted to life in their base camp at Hill 65. They make one campaign into the Arizona but there is little contact with the gooners. At the very end of the book they are trucked up to Hue City after Tet to help retake the city from the gooks. The men - Lt. Kramer, Chalice, Kovacs, Tony 5, Forsythe, Childs - lack any real character development. This one did not make my list of favorite Vietnam War Novels."
5,This is the best book EVER. READ IT,"Studying the vietnam war in school, we were lucky enough to have a guest speaker who gave me a copy of this book. After reading sevral books on vietnam, I found this one to be the absolute best acount of events and feelings ever. Anyone know of any others alike email me."
2,Didn't this novel come out before 1985?...,"I recall reading it in a house that I once owned before 1985, if I recall right. I was at An Hoa with the Marines (2/5) in Dec 67, so this story caught my attention. Roth's description of chow lines at An Hoa with the kerosene-fire water heaters brought back memories. I may read this novel again sometime soon. Hard for me to give the book a grade thirty years after reading. C plus or so, I'd say. Note: I'm not a big fiction guy. I also don't care much for most non-fiction book written by Vietnam vets as their scope on the war seems limited, and there understanding of the people, culture, and enemy during the war in VN largely absent in their writings."
3,Ok - But Fusion Leonardo wins at our house...,"This sword is fun... but for some reason, the Fusion Leonardo sword wins hands down at my house! I think the kids like how the Leonardo feels in their hands better, as these both make the same sounds and light up. Keep that in mind when buying this. My kids are 1,3,6 and 9. Hope this helps."
2,Caution getting into Denon because of parts availability,"As a caveat to prospective shoppers of what is one of the high end and costlier brands. Denon had me on a merry chase to get a remote control for an audio product. They have outsourced the parts department to Hermann's in Florida.""Sorry sir,your item is discontinued,you would need to buy the whole receiver to get the compatible remote for your deck."" Huh? This has a baloney flavor to me that I really do not like. Their HQ didnt seem to know much,frankly. My suggestion is to check out the high end models from Pioneer, Sony and JVC. They make accessories and parts avaiable directly and easily from the company. And no baloney. This is a competitive market and there are goodies aplenty such as inputs and outputs and circuitry goodies to shop for. (Unless the cachet factor is vital to you. In which event, good luck and don't forget the B and W speakers from UK.) Good luck and aloha. Gerry"
3,Not really necessary,"I got this tool thinking that it would be extremely helpful in changing my guitar strings. However, I found I didn't actually need it to change my guitar strings. The winding it provided didn't save a significant amount of time. I can imagine it being useful if I changed strings on a regular basis. In my case, I don't change my strings enough to merit buying it for the time it would save. This time, the costs outweighed the benefits. If the notch provided to help loosen the peg had worked better than it did, then it would be worth it. Unfortunately, the notch could not grasp the pegs on my particular guitar properly."
5,mamas going to buy you a mocing bird,This is a story of a boy copeing with terrible situation.The sickness and death of his father.While trying to cope with this and take care of his mother and sister.then he meets someone who has also lost a loved one.I loved this book
3,It's exactly what the title says!,"If you're looking to learn the ins and outs of mosaic making, if you're looking to glue shards of tesserae to boards and lamps and things, this isn't the book for you.If, on the other hand, you simply love the ""look"" of mosaics, this book will teach you how to recreate it using beads, bottle caps, dice, and everything else listed in the subtitle. Though many of the projects are attractive (like the ""Luxurious Journal,"" made of velvet squares), many are also a little tacky (like a clock made of beans).A few of the projects involve creating mosaics with actual glass and tile tesserae, but these are generally quickies-for beginners. And although the gallery in the back of the book contains a few terrific pieces, almost all of them are in dozens of other books on mosaic.It's a nice book for your mosaics library, but it's less than essential."
4,"NICE, BUT NOT HER BEST STUFF!","This is such a good idea (reissuing Dionne's old albums on CD after all these years). As an ardent fan, I was excited about this release in particular, because it contains Dionne's first Gold album, Here Where There Is Love. I must admit that I prefer Dionne's work from the late sixties and beyond, when her sound was more mature; this set captures the tail-end of the mid-sixties period. Nonetheless, it contains some fine work, with such tunes as ""Go With Love"" that you won't find anywhere else. A good buy!"
4,They work but last only one year,I have an outdoor motion detection light which uses one of these bulbs. They are very bright but only last one year. At least they are fairly cheap. I order 2 at a time so I always have a spare. These are real Westinghouse bulbs and not cheap knock-offs.
2,Wheelies and stoppies,"Unleashed is ok. It is mainly a guy doing wheelies and stoppies throughout the whole 55 minutes of the dvd. There is some cool stuff in it. I am not saying the riders aren't talented, I'd just like to have seen more variety."
5,get it if you can afford it.,"this is what i used in the Marine Corps. i wouldn't recommend it for inexperienced shooter because the reticule could be hard to get used to. if you're planning on going over seas and have time to get used to it then go for it.highly durable, takes a beating and stays sighted in, scratch resistant. be careful when making adjustments because the knobs can be fouled."
5,Excursion into a fanatic's mind,"One wonders how a person could be so eager to die for his country. This book tells of a young Japanese man who is selected to be ride a one-man torpedo to his death and hopefully to the destruction of an enemy vessel. He underwent much training, survived horrific experiences, and never seemed to lose his wish to die for his country, even after the Emperor said Japan must surrender. I found this book a most interesting study of the type of mind which apparently animated many Japanese soldiers and sailors during World War Two. He should have read Wilfrid Owen: ""The old Lie: Dulce et decorum estPro patria mori."""
3,One of the better TV movies.,"Based on a true story. TV movie of the week status aside, this little flick is prety good. Richard Thomas looks like a man now instead of JOHN BOY and he can still act. Vernon is good in her role and the long lost love angle works between these two. Great watch with the one you love. The MOVIE HOUND gives this flick 3 dog bones."
3,It was okay,"Low budget and predictable disaster movie but satisfying enough for true disaster movie buffs. The casting and acting were decent--unremarkable but realistic special effects, especially when compared to the for real mega floods in the Midwest, summer of 2008."
4,A good film from an Emergency Management P.O.V.,"The movie has a good story line and does a good job of showing the resistance Emergency Managers come up against in efforts to mitigate against disasters. It demonstrates the attitudes individuals in a community have when it comes to responding to a disaster. The move did get a little sappy in parts and just screams ""Made for TV"", but overall it was an enjoyable, uplifting movie."
4,1920 (Film)-2008,"1920 movie,2008, Very Good and Scary Movie in Hindi With English Subtitles. The movie is a Hindi Version of the Exorcism. Saw it on Hulu."
5,"3""x3"" work great on 2012 4runner!","I am very glad I purchased the 3""x3"" mirrors for my 2012 Toyota 4runner. I installed them as shown on the package and I have of everything around my vehicle. The mirror is very reflective, not like the cheap ones I have seen in auto parts stores. I would purchase the again."
3,Spotty Quality Control,I ordered 2 and had to return one because the plastic frame was malformed around one of the corners. The other one is good.
5,I now dont have a blind spot.,"These are perfect. Now, I dont have a blind spot while driving my pick-up. Arrived in 3 days and couldnt wait to put them on. They fit and are a must to all drivers with a blind spot. Thank you Amazon!!!MelNYC"
2,TOO Small miror,The product is made ok but I found it both too small and distracting. It takes up space in your main mirror and you are seeing two images. I took it off and ordered the mirror which mounts on top (or botton which I prefer) of your side view mirror. It is less distracting and doesn't use any of the viewing area on your existing side view mirror.
4,great results,Got these because my new chevy cruze had terrible blind spot & worked great. On bad note absolutely no instructions...i placed on upper corner closest to window basically because fit there but works great. No more blind spot. Still wondering how long adhesive will last but so far so good and has been rainy.
2,Threw away about 20mins later...,"The catch is that the mirrored image you get through this add-on projects a different scale view to your mirror whilst of course taking away space on your mirror from your regular view. So if you have a relatively small external mirror (and not a huge big thing like some SUVs do - it might be OK on those), then this thing obstructs the regular close-by views you are supposed to be getting from your car's mirror and then gives you a differently scaled view of everything else which now appears miles away on this tiny add-on (when it really isn't). Yes it catches the blind spot but can be confusing for all other view angles. I would not give it a safety pick confidence vote..."
2,Horrible shipping,It was 4 days late and doesnt even with the view of the blind spot.Dont buy it total waste of money
4,Good driver side spot mirror,"This is a good drivers side blindspot mirror and gives more visibility than the small round one that I have previosly used. I bought two of these , putting one on both sides of my Ford EDGE and find that the one on the passenger side is pretty much useless as the rear image from this mirror is too small and makes things look very far away when they are in fact quite close.I would highly recommend this mirror for the driver side but not for the passenger side."
4,Nice product .. but quite big for a Honda civic,"I got this for my Honda Civic and although its a nice product .. Its big for a small car ..But I use it now as my ""look behind"" mirror in my cubicle .."
4,Better than most...,"I originally bought these at a chain auto supply store to place on my new Ram truck. They worked well but soon disappeared as the adhesive gave up and they were lost on the road. I then went to Amazon and found them from a PRIME source at about half the cost. Mailing to my home took only a few days and I started all over again - only this time I added some badge and trim adhesive and now have well secured mirrors that provide excellent blind spot coverage. I like the mirrors but suggest better adhesive, so beware of this shortcoming. At the Amazon price you can well afford a tube of adhesive, even tough you shouldn't have to. This a great buy for PRIME members as the shipping cost would have been more than the product. Join Amazon Prime and enjoy REAL savings."
4,Blind spot gone!,"I use these mirrors in my Acura MDX. After driving a lot on multi-lane highways during a vacation trip, I quickly realized the need to do something about my MDX's rather large blind-spot. I eventually adjusted my mirrors to face outward (without seeing the side of the vehicle) and that helped a lot. Except I felt uncomfortable not having the overlap between by rear view mirror the side mirrors. Enter these blind-spot mirrors. Stuck it to the top corner of the side mirrors near the doors and now I have the overlap + more to give me a lot of confidence when driving.Points to note:1) The mirrors stick ""really"" well. You will find it difficult if you want to move it after you stuck it. I almost broke my side mirrors wanting to remove these to try the bigger 3"" x 3"" ones on the passenger side.2) If you are not used to having these blind-spot mirrors, it can take a little while to get used to them. I would say it took me about 3 weeks to be very comfortable with them."
5,Excellet for our SUV,"We have an SUV. I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors, there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them. This presents a problem when backing up as you cannot see the curbs clearly. So this helps a lot. The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb. These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes, you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders. Great mirrors and to this day, they remain clear. I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan."
2,not for a car,very big not useful as small mirror it is may be best for a truck or a big vehicle. not fit for acar
2,fell off.,It stuck just fine for about 3 months but as soon as I went through a car wash it fell off. Too bad because it helped a lot. But I expect to go through the car wash every once in a while so I won't be using this again.
1,Don't waste your money,"Sounds great, doesn't it? Such a simple concept to save a lot of bending over. The reality is quite different. I found that I had to expend a lot of energy really slamming the Coneivore onto a pine cone to make the plastic fingers bend enough to pick it up. Even then, several jabs were often required to pick up a single cone. I gave up before filling it a single time. It might work if the fingers were more flexible, but as presently configured, it is worse than useless because it takes up space. I recommend that you spend the money on a good pair of gardening gloves and resign yourself to bending over."
1,"Eats Felt for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner","Hands down the worst bass drum patch I've ever owned. I have brand new tama speed cobras, and this patch's rough surface has eaten away the felt on the bass drum beaters. Now I'm out 30 bucks for new beaters. So this patch may be cheap, but don't let it's price fool you because it'll end up costing you in the end. get aquarian or remo instead. I've never had a problem with either like I did with the Evans patch."
4,Happy with this book!,"This book was my only prep for the CLEP Eng Comp WITH ESSAY. (My school requires the essay.) I read the info once, skanned it a second time, and did only 2 of the practice tests.The exam was a breeze! The best thing about this book was the practice exams because the practices showed you exactly what to expect in the CLEP format. This REA book had quite a lot more detail than was needed for this particular exam.If you take this CLEP, watch your time. It's 50 questions in 45 minutes and involves a fair amount of reading."
2,Worst Polly Toy I've Bought,"My four year old loves Polly Pocket. I bought her this set, and it's just awful! Within minutes of opening the package, and putting it all together for her, the whole thing fell apart, again and again. The main gist of it ended up in the trash. I kept the little chair and dresser, and the doll: none of which are impressive.The only GOOD part: She does love the little car! She plays with it almost every day, but without the accessories (the hubcaps have little magnets on them, so I took 'em away...).Not worth more than you're willing to pay for the car."
3,not so great,"This is one of those toys that takes 3 arms to operate. It does work, but really only for an adult who has stronger hands to hold the device while pushing the yellow button from side to side. Overall, the girls just use the car as a car and don't bother playing with the makeover machine."
3,Take Everything with a Grain of Salt,"This writer, seemingly motivated does not possess the legal education to properly guide citizens accused of federal crimes. This book however does provide some interesting forms, specifically the worksheet to determing the public safety factor to address placement of an inmate. The book is certainly not for lawyers and in my opinion could cause a citizen accused to challenge his lawyer to his detriment. The old adage a little knowledge.....It is interesting to read his perspective on the system and the dialogue that he believes goes on between prosecutors and defense lawyers. Its a quick read and does provide a little insight even to a veteran litigator. If anything it will help you understand your client's feeling. Good luck to the writer as he is a true beliver and is dedicated to the defense of our citizens."

4,great toy,One of the best learning tools a child could have got this for my 9month old an she loves it. made of nice and sturdy wood and i would recommend that you buy it.
4,good puzzle,I am a speech therapist for little kids and I use the puzzle alot. We label the animals and imitate the sounds. The large knob handles make it easy for the child to do on his/her own.
3,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Barnyard Animals Jumbo Knob Puzzle,"I bought this for my grandson as his first puzzle. The big knobs on the the puzzle are good for a first puzzle; however, with only three pieces, children master this puzzle very quickly."
1,Dangerous toy for children,"I was excited to buy this puzzle for my young son and he enjoyed playing with it for the short time we had it. However, since the puzzle is made from cheap laminated/layered wood, the puzzle piece backings began to splinter and rip almost immediately. As such, this toy represents a pretty serious hazard to young children. It's not even well-designed: the pieces are very thick and tightly fitted into their slots, making it difficult to pull them out in any direction except directly upwards. Very disappointing overall."
5,Is what is expected.,"Pretty straight forward, good large plastic bags. When I sealed them with my impulse sealer they did burn off the excess plastic, but I am pretty sure it was due to the heat of my sealer and not the bags."
1,Just awful,"As a Carcinoid Cancer Survivor, this is one of the worst books I've seen on the subject. Halfway though this book the story becomes not Carcinoid Cancer, but the patient's husbands employment problems because he takes schoolkids on ski trips. Talk about losing control of the subject matter! If you want to learn about this cancer, go to www.carcinoid.org and skip this poorly written book."
2,Calorie Fat & Carbohydrate Counter,"The guide has several entries. I ordered over the internet after seeing the cover, thinking it had protein counts as well.Not useful to me."
5,A Very Helpful Tool !!!,"I bought this book because my original calorie counter was completely lacking many restaurants and was very disorganized. This calorie counter has easy to find sections, a very comprehensive restaurant section, and it is easy to carry in a purse. I have been trying to lose weight for so long and after two months of just watching my calorie intake, keeping a food journal, and a little exercise, I have lost 20lbs. This book is a very helpful tool if you are trying to lose weight, and become a healthier person."
4,Excellent Calorie Counter,I really enjoyed this book. I use it everyday to figure out the calorie intake of my food. It is very helpful for me with my counting calories. The added extras in the book such as the cartoons were also cute! Great reading!
2,In what century was this book written?,"I knew that this book was in trouble when the author recommended sending demos on cassette tapes rather than CDs because most people don't have CD players available. In one chapter he says it's important to use professional printers and graphic artists, and in the next say to use your PC to design and print your packages.Virtually everything in this book is out of date. I'm not surprised, as the author teaches at Berklee College of Music. When I was a student at Berklee, I realized most of the teachers had little or no professional experience. Most had been students at the school and were hired to teach immediately upon graduation. I don't know if that's the case with this author, but it is obvious he is completely out of touch with the state of the music business today."
3,The Self Promoting Musician,"My grand daughter needed this for college. While I know nothing about the book she says it was exactly what she needed.I do not now have the book so I can't comment on the content. She tells me if you are ""into music"" and you are even remotely thinking about going out on your own, buy this book.Wish I could help more."
4,Great Product,"I'm from Brazil, and i bought this book for general guidance on what to do on certain situations... i thought it wouldn't have in-deep explanations about the international music markets... but it does. All the rules and solutions apply here. It's a great aquisition for any musician out there, anywhere in the world, who has the will but is stuck in the day-to-day life of being an artist nowadays."
5,A classic!!!!!!!!!,"As soon as I bought the book I could not put it down I read it from top to bottom non-stop. This book is an easy read and very applicable. I highly recommend this book to gain greater insights in the Music business or any business. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit on Amazon, Music business 101, future of music and Guide to releasing an independent record by Tim Sweeney."
2,"Ordered 4 dozen, got just 4","I wanted a nice supply of drinking glasses that my grandchildren's small hands would fit around easily so they wouldn't slip out of their hands. These juice glasses were exactly the right size. I ordered 4 dozen of them to allow for breakage over time. I got exactly 4 glasses, not even enough to set a full breakfast table. The seller ignored my pleas for the remaining glasses, and Amazon finally had to reimburse me. I would rather have had the glasses, but I got tired of waiting for a response."
5,great juice glasses,"I like these glasses, they are very durable. Nice size for juice. The style goes with anything and are very pretty. I am hoping to get ones in the bigger size soon."
5,Libbey Juice glasses from Amazon,"We had been searching for these glasses for ages, finally gave up on dept. stores and ordered through Amazon. They arrived quickly and in perfect shape.Thank you, Amazon!"
4,12 ounce glasses,"The design on the 7 ounce glass is excellent and we were able to purchase only 12 instead of large amounts. We wish you offered the same design in the 12 ounce beverage glass in quantities of twelve 12. Instead, we had to settle for a different design in order to purchase only 12. Not only your web site but virtually all sites we visited only offered large amounts, I assume for restaurants. No reason to post this. This is not a complaint, only an observation.Al"
5,Sturdy glassware.,"I bought a set of the 22 oz glasses along with the 7 oz set. Like the larger version, these glasses are nice and thick and sturdy. I have zero fears of chipping or cracking while hand or machine washing. They sit solidly and are likely to resist tipping over due to their significant weight and stability. I'm very happy with both sets of glassware from Libbey Gibraltar."
2,Beware,"I bought this from VANN's in August 2011 and when it failed in November, they wanted nothing to do with me and referred me to APC for a warranty claim which in and of itself is painful.They are probably technically right and I understand that but most stores would behind a new product.It's a loud unit and after about 2 months it would start to beep and then would ultimately lose power shutting down the systems. If I left everything off for 24 hours and recharged it, it would work for a week or so but began slowly losing power.I expected a lot more from APC and Vann's."
3,I'm a sucker for interesting covers,I'm a sucker for interesting cover albums. I dunno why. Maybe its because I have had to do covers as a musician usually in a most uninteresting way. This album is stark even with the string arrangements which is mostly a good thing. The best track is the last/hidden track - a cover of B-side Everly Bro's song. The 1st track holds up too. They kinda slide from there in my opinion.
5,Up Front and Down Low with Teddy Thompson,"I had never heard of Teddy Thompson until I saw him on the David Letterman show, he is a great singer and this CD was great I give this 5 stars. MJ Campbell"
1,Disappointed,I like his newer stuff much better. This was too country for me. His newer music is more pop country.
1,"If you liked ""Separate Ways"", you might not like this","I liked Teddy Thompson's last album, ""Separate Ways"", enough to buy it. The songs were catchy, not too long, and well-written. He has a pleasant voice as well. But the songs weren't country. On ""Up Front and Down Low"", however, it's more than a toe in the pool, he's all the way country. And it's old-school country, with the twangy strings and all. If that's your thing, then you might like this, especially coming from such a talented musician. But it's not like the current breed of what is sometimes called alternative country such as Ryan Adams or Neko Case."
2,"Sorry Teddy , LEAVE THE COUNTRY ALONE","Ok, I like the voice, call it "" country Chris Issak/Marshall Crenshaw"" on this cd,BUT every one of these songs is better done by other artists!! I AM SORRY TEDDY, but its TRUE.Stick to your own songs, spare arrangements and have your Dad PLAY ON EVERY CUT.Now THAT would be a 4 star album.""A PIECE OF WHAT YOU NEED "" is a much better cd."
2,What's the Point?,I first heard Teddy Thompson's Separate Ways while visiting my sister and didn't stop playing if for about 3 months straight. FORTUNATELY I listened to Separate Ways first. Had it been Up Front I probably would have stopped there.Remakes of b-side country songs...What's the point. It doesn't show off his songwriting and incredible voice at all.Pass on this one and get Teddy Thompson and Separate Ways instead.
2,Too pricy!,14.99$ for a Carry case? I can get a PANASONIC 2 way radio at 30$ after 30$ rebate. This price for two cases might be more acceptable!
4,Fine But iPad App Is So Much Better,"Before the iPad, I would have said, fine, go ahead and get this product. I too was playing scrabble on my macbook, getting better so that I could beat my sister over on Facebook. Then I got my iPad and installed Hasbro's Scrabble App. The only word to use is PERFECTION for that app. The iPad is so much lighter and easier to carry around. I can whip it out of my purse anywhere and commence playing, whether sitting in a MacDonald's booth eating my hamburger or sitting on a picnic table by our condo pond enjoying the open air. Plus the App ties into Facebook if you and a Friend from there want to play one another. I also have the version for my iphone but it is far less satisfactory. So if you are a Scrabble addict, and I am, that alone may justify your getting an iPad. if you don't get an iPad though, this game on your macbook is the next best thing."
1,scrabble for macintosh,i hated the product because i was unable to use this product on my mac computer. i was unable to open the scrabble game and was very disappointed that i spent $11.99 on software that was completely useless.i have played scrabble on pc as well as kindle fire with no problems. all i want is to just play scrabble but to no avail.
5,Scrabble,"Easy to load, lots of difficulty levels. A great product. The company even contacted me to see if I was happy with the product."
3,Not the same,"I was so excited to find a scrabble CD that would be Mac OS X.5 friendly. This is it BUT, it is not the same game that I played on my OS 9. Not at all. The graphics don't compare, but more importantly, it doesn't ""challenge"" when your word is incorrect. Plus, there aren't the exercise games I used to play like 2 letter, 3 letter, anagrams, etc. Also, there isn't a way for more than one player to play the computer. One at a time anyway. No keeping tabs on running scores for other players in my house. It is very disappointing and I hope MacSoft can come up with an up to date game, not so ""Mickey Mouse""."
1,Not up to date,"The version is a 2007 and does not allow you to exit. I bought the same version years ago and cannot exit this one either. I was under the impression that this was the newest version. You should tell customers that this is a 2007 version. My Mac has the newest, up to date, software. I did not send it back because I did not think it was worth the bother"
4,misunderstood......but a good way to improve,"When purchasing this game I thought ""with a friend"" meant you could play on line with your family or friends ONLINE. I did know it meant you had to have the person playing on your computer at the same time.Final answer: it's okay.P Grandemadison NJ"
5,A great buy!,After years of playing Scrabble on my old PC and recently going from a PC to Mac I longed to start playing again. This game is more dynamic than what I had used. I like being able to have several levels of computer challengers. I also like how it shows the individual points a specific word produced. Easy to navigate and very addicting!
3,A disappointment!,"After years of fun with Scrabble on my Windows PC, I missed the game when I switched to an iMac. I thought this was the answer--but it is an inferior version of the game compared to what I'm used to. For starters, the software locks up, mostly when exiting (but not during a game) once in a while, necessitating a forced quit. I'm also used to a choice of board appearance options, but here there are none. It lacks some of the nicer features I'm accustomed to, even in the cheap General Mills/AOL promotional cereal box version I got for Windows years ago. Sure, it isn't a total waste, it works mostly okay, but if you are used to a really good Windows version, this is minor league quality in comparison. This will get you by if you are a Scrabble-starved Mac owner, just expect hamburger, not filet mignon."
2,Grandoe men's driving gloves,These were not as smooth fitting as appeared to be; just too bulky in the fingers. Probably would not buy withoutseeing first.. rsdavis1414@gmail
4,Great Film,"Really great film that focuses on the psychological underpinnings of mobsters. The whole thing surrounds the funeral of a mob boss's son and questions the various moral dimensions involved in the life of mobsters; religion, family, loyalty, and revenge to name a few. Also it provides a poignant view of women and their various roles in the mob family. Great companion to the Godfather movies and it has a terrific cast!"
5,powerful performances,"an all star cast led by Christopher Walken and Chris Penn,this movie is a classic and a rare work of art.Annabella Sciorra,Isabella Rossellini,Benicio Del Toro all give powerful performances is this gangland epic."
1,extremely disappointed,"DON'T BE FOOLED!!! first let me say that i am a big fan of Bad Lieutenant,King of New York and Christopher Walken.who doesn't already know that Walken,Penn,Del Torro,and Gallo are already great actors? of course they are good but that does not make it a reason to see this worthless piece of trash.Ferrara directs this movie at a snail's pace and makes you not care about the characters.he tries but to no avail.i had heard such great things about this movie and after watching this i find myself wondering why.i won't go into any detail because i refuse to waste another few minutes on this disappointing film.so don't believe the hype.don't be fooled by the great cast.they're seriously wasted amongst this turd.consider yourself warned."
3,The (...) scene,"I enjoy almost every thing that Christopher Walken is involved in so too this mob film. However, does anyone else remember that when this film was released, there was a rumor, that the (...) scene was....................real?"
4,Inside jokes,"This is humor for the initiated. If you are familiar with (and scornful of) Theory, postmodernism, deconstruction, Derrida, etc., you'll get the jokes. If you're one of the uninitiated (like me), most of the jabs and puns will be baffling. I did some reading about the targets of the humor, after which many of the entries made more sense. But, as the saying goes, frogs and humor fare poorly upon dissection.You'll understand some of the entries better if you read the authors' other book first, Why Truth Matters. That book also assumes some familiarity with the Theory, but it gives you a much better feel for the basis of the authors' derision.Even if you don't understand all of the entries, you'll be able to chuckle knowingly when you hit on one you understand. It's great to be on the inside."
2,Dachshunds should be outdoors,"What a bizarre little book. I happened upon it online, and thought it would be adorable. It isn't adorable...Just perplexing. Seems the author used photoshop to just cut and paste pictures of her dachshunds into doorways of buildings. That's it. Am I missing something? Will the sequel be Dachshunds in windows?"
5,One of the Best of the Year,"Spooted Peccary keeps coming up with these amazing CD artists, and Mark Hunton is definitely one! This is an adult, sophisticated musical journey through mountains and mysticism. The musical quality of the peices is superb, and every cut is excellent. There are many layers of sound so that each time you listen it gets better and better. Definitely one of the best of 1999."
4,Dinosaur Awesomeness,"If your girlfriend is into dinos, then this is the perfect gift for her. Mine loves it. Had it almost a couple years now and still looks and works great! It's a little hard to open, but it's so tiny that's to be expected."
5,"Timeless in Time: Sri Ramana Maharshi, a Biography",These intimate meetings from devotees with Ramana make me feel as if I'm sitting at the feet of this great spirit. My heart sings and yearns to be in that Beyond-space for ever...
3,Dí Rénjié in Guangzhou,"This story takes place near the end of Judge Dee's career, or at the least Robert van Gulik's stories.The earlier novels are more enjoyable before Judge Dee begins his promotional climb to the position of senior Metropolitan Judge in the capital, and his assistants obtain official ranks in the Army and civil service.That being said, I enjoyed the story, but was not as captivated as I was by earlier stories."
2,"good concept, but not very well written","I was intrigued by the concept of a detective mystery set in Tang Dynasty China. Unfortunately the author hasn't mastered the essentials of writing a really good novel. The characters didn't feel believable, the dialogue is stiff and unnatural, and the plot is slow-moving and contrived."
3,Not really essential at all.,"Since the way to get the Geocache locations is to go to the website and get them online, which also tells you everything else you need to know about the game, you don't really need this book at all.-------------------------UPDATE:I have just read THE COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO GEOCACHING (The ORANGE book, NOT the yellow book) and it is EXCELLENT!!If you want a good book on Geocaching, get that one!(The yellow ""for dummies"" book, which I also read, is not very good)"
3,Good for Brand New Geocacher,"This is a pretty basic book. If you are thinking about geocaching or are brand new. If you have found a couple of caches using a GPS or if you have been in the military, you will probably not find anything of interest here."
5,Loved it!! :),"The fourth tape in this very interesting series brings the story around in a surprising turn. The re-incarnated Incan warriors continue to fight for their own beliefs, and they still form the two opposing sides that fate has brought them to, for the second time. I won't tell you what happens... ~.^ That would ruin the story, but I will tell you that if you made it through the (relatively) boring first tape, then you won't regret continuing to purchase and watch this series. The fourth tape brings in the drama and suspense that we all love from a good anime series. If you liked the first three tapes, you'll love the fourth tape!!"
4,Excellent Summary of the Problem,"This book is a worthwhile read for professionals seriously involved in integrating PLM/PDM and SCM systems. It's sometimes difficult to explain clearly the fundamental differences in these models and to identify how they can be bridged. It's a long and detailed explanation of both, not for the faint of heart, but the best I've seen so far."
3,Broken CD case,"I gave this review three stars because of the following...1) the cd case was broken2) the cd's would not stay in the caseThe item did arrive before the promised date, that was good. But I just wish I would of got it new, like they described it."
3,Diferencia-Difference,"La diferencia entre Maná y Police quizás sea que Maná copia a Police, lo cual no creo conveniente, 'I correct, The only difference between Maná and a Police concert is that Maná copy to Police and that is not good' Eso no es bueno porque lo que distingue a los buenos de los demás es la originalidad, mezcla de instrumentos, letras que no ofendan no sonidos que chillen (refiérase al track 13 de Sueños Líquidos). Lo que diferencia a los buenos de los malos es que los primeros poseen un sonido refrescante que los caracteriza, letras propias, ritmo que complazca a todos, melodía o llámese todo esto ENANITOS VERDES."
1,suena a pan con lo mismo que onda,mana no suena ni truena que paso con ellos se les acabo la creatividad ahora cantan hasta las de Vicente Fernandez y juan gabriel ¿sera acaso que ya no pueden hacer mas musica se les acaba la inspiracion? en fin....... puras rancheras
2,plain purple adjustable hat,Love the color purple and the hat is adjustable for a better fit but the cap is very deep and I found that it's just too large for my head.
5,A wonderful children's book,"A Place In The Sky is by far one of the most beautifully written and illustrated children's picture book I ever read. I feel the loss of the balloon and the fantasyland little Sarah visits is symbolic for more significant losses, and a tender, sensitive way for parents to help their child cope, whether it is death or divorce or a lost pet.I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone; it is a breath of fresh air and a ""must have"" for parents who want their children to experience an engaging story that cultivates kindliness, humanity and consideration for others."
4,did the job,The fan blades were flimsy and the motor fairly loud...but the good thing was there was adapter pieces included so I was able to put my old blades on w/a little tinkering...all in all wasn't an exact fit but with some work did the job.
3,Average,"I bought this book hoping it would clarify some of the issues I have with TDD, but not so. Granted the book does a decent job explaining what TDD is, but the level of coverage and detailed explanations aren't good."
2,Too shallow,"The book provides only shallow explanation of how TDD is supposed to work. Oversimplification may lead to bad code. For example, Red/Green/Refactor principle is only good if your first test is comrehensice enough. Imagine you are writing a parser for a complex language (HTML, C++, whatever). You simply can't write it piece by piece, i.e. write test for parsing a simple construct and then add more code to parse more complex constructs. What you end up with is a bunch of spagetti ifs. Your first test should be large enough to force you to use lex/yacc approach. The grammar does not have to be complete, but the framework has to be there from the beginning. Stack example is way too simple. C'mon, decent developer should be able to implement it correctly on whiteboard in 30 minutes. NUnit software is mentioned too many times, the book begins to look like a commercial."
5,Practical How-To,"Great hands on tutorial for unit (NUnit) and user testing (fit.c2). The authors provide practical advice on how to refactor software, as well as, code ala Test-Driven Development.FYI, the demonstrations are written in C# with some very ""real"" senarios."
2,Expected more in-depth,"The book was a decent into to TDD, however given the description I expected it to go more in depth into handling the issues of database access testing, ASP.NET, and other mocking issues. The book only touches on these issues, and does not get into the deeper problems that arise, especially when a larger system has lots of interactions among it's parts."
1,Call me Colette.,"Searching the bookshelves alone in a foreign country, this book was the only possibility. Colette comes across as a very astute business woman, albiet a pretty scary looking one. I never read any of her books which are explained as being soft-porn. She wrote in the early part of the 20th century and gained fame and fortune using a single name only, the Cher of her time. She was the rave of France. I am not sure why. Probably France was not a very intersting place at that time either. Her final book was ""Gigi"". I don't want to read any of her voluminous works. Her mother had a very interesting face. That's about the best of this biography. Perhaps there are other authors who make her out to be a more interesting person."
4,Shaka Zulu,Very well made series about a African ruler who created a true African Kingdom about the size of the UK in the 19th century.
5,Wena weZulu,"This movie has become the inspiration in my life. Shaka guides me day and night in all my endeavours. I won an age-group gold medal in my first Ironman, ran my first marathon in under 3 hours, and have recently been nominated for a Rhodes Scholarship. For anyone who wants not only to see an absolutely brilliant portrayal of this legend, but also has the commitment to follow in the ways of Shaka, this is THE movie to get."
5,Simplistic,"A typical Hollywood revisionist version of a great and complex man (with many sociopathic idiosyncracies), written by fat-cats in the US, less interested in a nation's rich culture rather that turning a fast buck showing African women's breasts"
5,"A very LONG, accurate portrayal of Shaka Zulu","I didn't know about this movie until I saw it at my friends house. It had my favorite actor, Robert Powell in it, so I decided to give it a try. This movie is very long, I can say that, but the acting and the cinemetography is wonderful. The soundtrack could use a little work, though. The story basically focuses on the life of the Zulu chief Shaka Zulu from his illegitemate birth to a commoner to his rise in power as a chief to his death. After shaka zulu was born, he was forced to leave his village because he was born between a prince and a commoner. Out in the wildnerness, he learns to live under the harsh conditions. Later he becomes a warrior, and reclaims his rightful place as zulu king. The movie is very dramatic piece of work, and is worthwhile to watch."
3,SHAKA ZULU,"Seeing this film when it was on t.v as a mini seris I was drawn by the legend,and how his great nation was not the unorginized bunch of savages britian thought it was. Sadly After purchasing this tape I was surprised to see VIDMARK cram 300 mintue into one tape recorded at ep speed. The quility of the picture was almost fair, but the sound would contiuly go in and out. Then to add more insult to this great film very essential parts were edited out that would explain Shakas determination of revenge. Its a shame that this is what this great documentry film has been reduced to throughout time."
5,powerful film,i enjoyed this film.very powerful and ruthless.lots of action and intrigue.a must have collection.
5,A Wonderful Step-by-Step Guide for Painters,This book is wonderful. The pictures are in color and show such good detail. The step by step guide makes it seems like the instructor is actually in the room with you. This book is great for intermediate to advanced painters and would recommend to anyone who enjoys this hobbie.
3,Camera's great but software is trouble.,"We love the camera and the printer is very nice. When we tried to install the supplied software, there is some sort of conflict and it turns off my wireless router. I've tried to fix the problem, but haven't been able to get it to work."
2,Danskin Core Board,It's ok but it is not something I would pay for. I got this free with the the purchase of my incline bench from Danskin. The board does not turn with ease and feels very awkward. It makes a great conversation piece :-)
1,Avoid,Another non-anamorphic pal>ntsc transfer from Well Go USA. Shaw Brothers fans looking for a good quality release should look elsewhere.
4,Loved the style,Loved the Style of this spice rack. Looks good in kitchen......Attractive. It has all spices u need. Good Deal!!!!Helps to look your kitchen beautiful.
5,My daughter loves it!!!,"I bought this spice rack for my adult daughter. She likes to cook and I thought this set of spices would be ""young"" enough to fit in her kitchen. She loves it! She's happy, so I'm happy!! :o)"
2,Poor Quality Rack,My wife and I received this as a wedding gift.The rack look nice and the spices seem to be of decent quality but the quality of the spice rack leaves much to be desired. The containers seem to be made of glass or a thick acrylic but the lids are made of cheap looking and feeling plastic. They also do not close well.The rack itself is also made of cheap feeling plastic and the spice containers fall off the racks occasionally.If I would have bought this I would return it. Look elsewhere
1,Don't waste your money,"The caps on the jars are very flimsy. Once opened, they seldom snap shut to keep the spices fresh. Don't waste your money on this plastic junk."
4,Very attractive,"This keeps all spinces in an orderly, neat and attractive way in my kitchen. Very impressive looking and would make a nice gift."
3,It's okay,"I do love the way it looks...that's about it.I am not familiar with half the spices that are given with this product and the lettering on the bottles is way too small!It's pretty, but not worth the money."
3,Tops don't close securely,"As others have stated, the tops break and don't snap closed securely or simply fall off leaving your spices to dry out and loose flavor. If not for that, I would give it 5 stars."
5,It's so unique - I love it!,"I recently purchased this item because we had to take my spice cabinet out of the kitchen due to the purchase of a rather large brushed metal refrigerator that required extra space. I've NEVER liked spice racks and was not happy that I had to get one - especially one I have keep on the counter.But I have had compliment after compliment on this spice rack from everyone who comes into my kitchen - it's very unique and attractive. Everyone plays with the jars and checks out the spices, opens and smells them...who would do that with a ""regular"" spice rack??!The spices are fresh, and there is a nice variety of them, some are things I've not used before, but since I have them now, I've been experimenting and my family really likes the variety.The only drawback is that the names engraved in the jar cover are slightly hard to read at a glance as they kind of blend in - I always have to go get my glasses."
4,"Looks great, works pretty well","This is a great product except for one little thing: a few of the lids do not snap all the way shut. I do not mind, but someone who has bug or humidity issues might want to consider another product."
3,"looks nice, not practical.","most of the product is made of flimsy plastic, barely holds up the glass jars.doesn't hold the jars firmly in place, they fall out when you spin it.flimsy plastic breaks easily. had to send one back becuase it was broken in transit.it's cool looking, but beyond that, way not worth the 50 bucks."
2,"It looks great, but...","I received this spice rack as a wedding present, and it looks great on my kitchen counter! But when it comes to functionality, it leaves much to be desired. You cannot fit a teaspoon into the jars, so measuring out spices always turns into a mess. There are also many spices that I would never use, and several that I wish it had, such as garlic, onion, or cayenne... I would not buy this spice rack again."
5,Stylish and Useful,"Doesn't exactly look high-end, but it fits with any decor. The jars have shake and pour sides and seal really well. It has been perfect to organize things in our new kitchen."
2,Returning this item,"I thought this was a nice looking item, but before I was even able to unpackage it, a jar flew out of the box and shattered on the floor. I think the glass is not sturdy enough, and it seems likely that jars will occasionally be dropped. I am returning this item and will look for one with sturdier jars or the magnetic tins."
5,Practical,It is as good looking as it is practical. A really nice (and durable rack) that will look great in your kitchen
5,functional product,I like the product because the ease of using it and it also fits into my cabinet well. The spices also seem to be good quality. It is not a heavy item but with regular normal use I think it will last for years.
5,Great gift!,This is a fabulous item! It has many of the most frequently used spices and is easy to use & looks great on your countertop! Shipping was quick & the rack was very well packaged.
3,Nice spice rack except for a couple things,"I got this spice rack this summer and it was great except for a few of the jars whose tops wouldn't stay closed or screw on all the way, but now all the spices have gone bad and are starting to get a little fuzzy so I have to throw them all out. I just have to wonder if they're poorly sealed containers and that is why the spices are going bad. Hopefully the new spices I buy wont go bad so quickly."
2,Cute lil suckers.. But they just don't seal.,"I just wanted to write a quick review to inform others because the lids on these are just terrible. After having it for a little less than 2 years, we found little tiny bugs in a few of the jars since they don't seal well. Pretty nasty.. and we keep a very clean house too! They really look great and I love that they are labeled, but the lids are lacking big time. I would give it one star but they sure do look great so I gave them an extra star. Maybe they've improved the lids since I've had them but I doubt it. Go try them in a store if possible.. Open the half lids and close them and see how loose they fit. (We received ours as a Wedding gift so I didn't get to try them first). Some of mine were tight, but about half were loose. Oh well, on to the next spice rack."
4,We love it!,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVES it! It looks really nice on the counter top.
3,No cayenne?,"OK overall, but I when i grabbed for cumin and cayenne I was disappointed. I feel like those are staples and they are lacking here."
4,Pretty Nice,We received these as a wedding gift and they look great in person and give a sleek look to the otherwise average spice rack. Great purchase!
4,"Fast shipping, beautiful product, box dented","This came to my house faster than another product I had paid for weeks earlier. Very happy! The box was a little dented but otherwise, everything else was good. Very pretty set! Can't wait for my boyfriend to open it for Christmas!"
3,used in normal,"I have purchased spice racks in the past, and found that they contained spices I had no idea what to do with. This spice rack is attractive, does not take up a lot of space, and it contained spices that could definitely be used in normal, everyday cooking."
3,Cute Little Spice Rack.......BUT.....,"The rack is made of black plastic...The jar lids and ""handle"" are chromed plastic and not ""stainless' as stated in the manufacturer's description and some of the jars do not fit securely into the rack so they can and will fall off.The assortment of spices that came with the rack I got leave a lot to be desired. Unlabeled or labeled, filled or unfilled, jars made for this particular spice rack can not be purchased from Olde Thompson and I have not been able to find them elsewhere.It does, however; look cute and doesn't take up much counter space...But,if you want functionality, I would not recommend this product."
2,Beauty AND Function!...not quite,"Olde Thompson 16-Jar Orbit Spice RackThis spice rack has the double prize of not only having a wonderful array of spices, but it very attractive! Several friends who have wandered through my kitchen have commented on the rack and how pretty it is.NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS. It is almost impossible to read the labels! So, when you are looking for a spice, you tend to pick up the entire spice holder and take it to a window with lots of light and STILL squint! Too bad, it is really attractive in the kitchen."
5,Love them spices,An excellent product that was delivered promptly. My cooking is now 16 times more fun.
3,good,Its a good way to store all ur spices in one place.. but the caps are a bit loose which makes it loose its freshness pretty soon.. apart from that i found this item good..
3,Full of heart - full of typos,"A chronology of Jerod Haase's senior season at Kansas, taken from e-mail correspondence to co-author Mark Horvath. I admire Haase's courage and frankness in baring his soul, although at times the accounts get pretty cliche. If Horvath's primary role in this project was copy editing, he should be ashamed! The text is full of grammatical errors that eventually become distracting.Warning: Missouri fans will not be pleased; they might be downright ashamed after reading about some of the Tiger antics described in this book!"
5,This book was the only interesting biography I've seen.,"This was an inspirational book about hard work and toughness. I don't know another player who would continue playing after something like what happened to Jerod Haase. Before I read this book I had no idea of what student athlete's go through at Kansas, or any other College. This is a good book for anyone who likes sports."
2,Didn't do it for me,I first did the 14 day treatment with the Yeast Arrest by vitanica. After that was over I saw remarkable improvement in my condition so I decided to follow up with the Candaclear Lozenges and after about 3 days of usage I became extremely irritated and there was a return of the monster yeast. I subsequently tried to go back on the Yeast Arrest for a few more days to undue the damage. But a few days wasn't enough and I couldn't put my husband off for another 14 days. So back to the dreadful diflucan which works for about 3 months. I know it was the Candaclear causing the irritation because I stopped then started it again just to be sure. The irritation and yeast did also.
1,Never Received,"I am very displeased w/the service I was provided. My package was supposedly was delivered, but when I tried to get it resolved this seller was of NO HELP. Very disappointed."
1,BEWARE,"TOOK THIS PRODUCT FAITHFULLY FOR ONE MONTH AND THIS DID NOTHING TO HELP ARTHRITIC PAIN, JOINT PAIN, OR ANYTHING.......I THINK THIS IS A RIP OFF.........WOULD NOT BUY IT OR RECOMMEND IT....."
3,Price is right,Have not noticed it helping me at all so I would not need purchase again it may work for others just not me.
3,"PRICKLY PEAR-HAS POSSIBILITIES, I THINK","Ok, I will admit to expecting miracles right off the bat when I take a supplement. Maybe not ""miracles"" but at least some sign that a supplement has potential; otherwise, I'm pretty much on to the next thing or nothing.With the Prickly Pear capsule, purchased with Hemp oil capsule, I think it did help with the aches/pains of just...getting older. There! I said it!! Just turned 60 yrs old and still cannot believe it. Anyway, I don't have anything negative to say about the product. When I was taking it consistently I think it did help. Problem is I tend to only take prescription medications consistently over the long term. Writing this review makes me realize I should go back to giving the product a real shot-with the Hemp oil capsule. Actually read about this combo on another customer's review."
5,The Inside Dope on The Ghastly One,"When a friend gave me copy of this book, and said to read it, I thought he was nuts! Having long considered Andy Milligan one of the worst directors who ever lived, I couldn't think I would care about his life, but my friend insisted, and told me even if you think Andy's films stink, that his life was worth reading about, and damned if he wasn't correct! This is a completely fascinating look at a fascinating life. Milligan comes out of an avant-garde theatrical groupd centered around Cino's Cafe in Greenwich Village, and it makes for deeply compelling reading. I can say this book almost - I say ALMOST - makes me want to revisit his films.Can't recommend this enough."
2,We need to find some better heroes.,"Andy Milligan was a terrible filmmaker, and his snail-paced movies, which blended trash and pompous period costumes, can only be called unwatchable. His final film, Monstrosity, was truly the work of an incoherent brain, blending rape, hypodermic needles, and a grinning slapstick monster wearing a Fred Flintstone suit. McDonough's book is fascinating at first, but then one realizes that these aren't artists being described with such misguided affection. Like Warhol's crowd, Milligan's world was populated by uneducated drug addicts, and people obsessed with their own fractured sexuality. One of these days, there'll be a book about a true underground filmmaker, but in the meantime, we're stuck with the sniveling praise of sycophants like John Waters, and books like this which glorify the excretions of talentless slobs."
2,Too Partisan to be Enlightening,"Boyd's view and understanding of oneness pentecostalism areneither impartial or new. His observations are akin to asking anotherspiritual ""expert"" like Shirley MacLaine to write a dissertation on the Baptist church. She claims to have been a Baptist at one time, but would you really trust her to give a fair and accurate report? Hardly. Read it for what it is -- the words of a disgruntled former church member disguised as theology commentary. If you enjoy demagogues like Hank Hanegraaff, perhaps this is the book for you. If you're looking for an honest and impartial explanation of the oneness belief, it is not. One of these days, someone will not be afraid to openly and honestly discuss the Trinity/Oneness situation. This is not the book...."
3,Phd could mean Paper Hanging Degree (Not All Truth),"The reason I say some truths is because there are some truths to the things he writes, that are wrong in the UPC. However there are some glaring untruths also which only serve to foment animosity rather than examine the truth itself. This could have been a good work were it not for this. One does not have to use vociferous jargon to disagree with something and because you are the biggest on the block does not make you right, For that matter slavery was right, many ""Trinitarian Christians"" practiced it. If anything heresy could be applied to those who have foster a term that is NO where in the New Testament, ""TRINITY"", why is that not also true? Who knows all that there is to know of GOD?"
1,A rather weak presentation.,"I am not a ""Oneness Pentecostal."" Nonetheless I found Prof. Boyd's book as a work of ""scholarship"" to be a disappointment. It is rather poorly written and in many of his arguments for the Trinity Prof. Boyd makes use of common fallacies of logic, and his knowledge of biblical Greek is inadequate for the task at hand. His occasional use of 'ad hominem' regarding his opponents (e.g., p. 84 - ""cultic reasoning"") has no place in a supposed work of objective scholarship. The lack of subject, author and scripture indexes make it inconvenient to use as a reference tool."
1,99% garbage,"Gregory Boyd may claim to have been a Oneness Pentecostal, but he must have slept through a lot of Bible studies. Most of what he claims to be Oneness belief is not. Mr. Boyd does not understand Oneness doctrine, and does a good job of proving that in this book. This book will not help anyone understand the Oneness doctrine. I do recomend this book to all closed-minded, anti-Oneness, heresy hunters, who are not interested in knowing the truth about anything"
3,Mixed review,"From the viewpoint of a oneness pentecostal, I must say that although Gregory Boyd is wrong on several counts, he has presented-so far-the most accurate representation of the oneness movement by a major publisher, Zonderan. I can only say this because every single other author touching the subject have consistently and grossly misrepresented the Oneness faith."
1,content,the reading was not good it is not scriptural and it is just one mans view and goes against the Bible
1,"would have been nice, but...","upon opening the package there were several stains on the nightshirt :( I'm hoping it's a fluke, but v. disapointed. Otherwise, the silk knit is nice, lightweight (yes, it IS as sheer as the picture looks), and seems true to size."
3,"Very silky, but not pink!",I ordered the pink nightshirt and was disappointed when I saw it was definitely not pink; it's peach. It it had been pink I'd give it five stars; it is very soft though.
2,Not what it was suppose to be !!,When I received this item I was was dissapointed !First of all I ordered a pink one and it was not pink it was peach.Then the second dissapointment was that I thought it was suppose to be silk and it looked and felt more like polyester.It was an ok price and I do like the nightshirt but I do not feel that I got what I thought I was ordering.
5,Great item!,"I gave this to a little kiddo who just turned 1 and is starting the walking process. I love this toy because even my 2 year old loves pull toys still to this day. I have also had great success with Plan Toys and think they are quality built. This one looks great and shows cause and effect. Based on the feedback I have received from the parents, he loves it and it is in great shape and works well."
3,Almost perfect...,This train is pretty cool. My son prefers when I pull it around so that he can follow and watch all of the moving parts. It is well made and has great colors. The only thing is the middle car. It has a big wheel that turns as the train moves. The problem is the wheel is not attached so it is constantly getting misplaced which makes the train a lot less fun to watch. This would have been a deal breaker had I known before purchasing.
3,Like their older DVDs,I bought their new DVDs last year and didn't like them as much as their older ones. I feel like I work harder in the older ones. It is in the same case with these two new ones also.
4,something old and new,Ana and Bret continual to surprise me. They were able to create something with a new twist. Solar power is very similiar to the last group created by Ana and Bret. Tradition hatha yoga poses along side kundalini sequences. this flows very nicely. This is a very doable workout for all level yet enough that more advance will not being bored
1,Didn't like this at all,"I bought this based on the great reviews.....only to find out that it was a complete waste of money for me. The workout didn't get my heart rate up at all, the 'new age' stuff was almost too much for me to bear (I turned it off before it ended), and the music was horrible. I have Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest, Ellen Barrett, Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga, and they are ALL so much better than this! If you want a new age yoga dvd that ""all the stars are doing"" (it figures), then by all means, buy this one. I threw it away!"
5,Get Your Kundalini On!,"I have every one of Ana & Ravi's DVD releases, and there's only a small handful of non-favorites, though I love and do them as well. Their style of workout is truly for inner and outer body, and you feel it every time. ""Solar Power"" moves at a nice clip as opposed to some of the others. You still relax a little in between some of the exercises, but it seems like you get much more work out in the first 45 minutes than usual. I can't say enough about their workouts or this new series. Much better than the last three... I have to say!The 10-minute breath of fire segment was awesome! If this workout is done in the morning, your whole day feels more energized. Ana looks adorable as usual, and is a true inspiration. I am anxiously awaiting the Transformer workout which should arrive tomorrow. Wooo hooo!! I guess tomorrow morning I'll have to re-do ""Solar Power."" ;-)"
5,"It really is an ""All in One"" workout","I have half-a-dozen Ana & Ravi DVDs. I love them all, but this one became a fast favorite. It works on every part of the body but is still appropriate for beginners and advanced practicianers. This video leaves me feeling great all day!"
4,Solar Energy,"This DVD is awesome - I love the sets and they do create a transformative energy right in the solar plexus. The only reason it is not 5 stars is that the DVD will only play on my living room player, and even then sticks sometimes. But I do love this DVD!"
4,Sony LCSVAT Case,Good case for compact camcorder. It is very compact and the construction is very good. It has just enough room for my Sony camcorder(Sony DCR-SR100). The external pocket is large enough for two or three extra batteries. Don't expect to fit any other accessory.
3,Not bad case.,"Case holds camera and a tape, but that's about all. I like the fact that it holds the camera with ease. I throw it over my head/shoulder and let it hang on my side until ready to use the camera. It will hold an extra bettery if it's not too big, but you have to kind of PACK it in. if you want to grab the camera out for a quick shot, you'll have to tug a little because when you put anything in the front pouch, it protrudes ""inside"" instead of out taking up internal space. If the outside pouch was a little more expanded out, this would be a great 'little' case for a short trip to a ball game or that play your child's in and not have to worry about stuffing extra tape or a battery in your pocket."
1,Too big for small camcorders,"I made mistake getting such a big & bulky case for small MiniDV Sony camcorder HC26. This case can take any big size old camcorders (like old Sony Hi8), so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice."
4,Excellent coverage for today's health conscious consumer,"I found this book full of great information. It lives up to its name as the ""Most Complete Food Counter."" The wide range of foods contained within is quite useful, escpecially the list of fast foods and ready made meals. My one critique is that it could have tab headings on the pages to help you locate items more easily."
1,Waste of Time,"If you do not have infinite patience DO NOT buy this book. While it contains over 800 pages of nutritional information and is very comprehensive it has NO organization to it. There is a very brief table of contents and no index at all. The contents are arranged alphebetically but there is no color coding or shading on the edges of the pages to indicate where A stops and B begins and so on. I HATED using it and only did so for about a week. Then I went out and bought a new calorie counting book which also included fat and carb information, which is all I need and wanted. My replacement book contains a Table of Contents, an index and is color coded and cost about 1/2 the price of this one."
2,Disappointed,"This is primarily a reflection of our society as about 80% of it is the calories and other info on prepackaged foods that are already labeled.The organizantion is just alphabetical so it's difficult to find for example, 1/2 chicken breast, or cup of spaghetti."
5,Excellent Resource!,"The Most Complete Food Counter is an excellent resource. Since I mostly cook from scratch, which is healthier, I cannot simply ""look at labels"" to find the nutritional information I need. Recently starting a low-carb diet, I find this book extremely helpful in weighing (no pun intended) my options before I shop, before I cook. This book gives me the knowledge I need to make informed, healthful decisions.While I rarely eat at fast food and chain restaurants, the section in the back of the book will be a great resource for determining, prior to going out, what food options meet my specific dietary needs and how that meal will fit into my overall food planning that day.I highly recommend this publication!"
2,"Never use it, outdated, hard to read","Save the money and look it up online. Books like these seem to have lost their place now. This is hard to read, outdated and not always accurate."
2,The most complete food counter,I had to return this book back to amazon as I was not able to read the charts in the book on my kindle
1,Not pleased,"The Most Complete Food Counter: 2nd EditionI bought the Kindle edition of this book and it is the first time I have bee very dissatisfied with any of my books, all of it would let me enlarge the print EXCEPT the break down to how many calories - carbohydrates - sodium and so forth, in each food. so if you want to see that portion buy the paper back book."
2,diet book,I was very disappointed after waiting 3 extra months for the book to be setup as a kindle book the back part where the general descriptions was only scanned (Bad) and not searchable. Looks like they just wimped out.
1,NOT AT ALL FOR KINDLE,"I'm writing this review as a warning to all Kindle owners. I bought this book thinking it would be great and it might be but I wouldn't know because of the way it's formatted for Kindle. The first part of the book is okay - you can adjust font size and all - through the introduction. But once you reach the actual lists of foods and their calorie/carb count, the print becomes microscopic and nonadjustable. So, basically 70% of the book is useless - and the best parts of the book too.I really wish that whoever translates these books into Kindle Format would preview them first.Anyhow, thankfully, Amazon Customer Service is amazing and I was able to return it.Please do not make the same mistake as I did and purchase this book for Kindle."
3,Not for the heavy man,This product did not hold up for my 325 lb husband. It would probably be ok for a smaller man but the wheels buckled after just a few uses. He also prefers the stool style seat over this one.
1,Nice But!,"Looked at all the Reviews, Purchased this Seat.Went together nice, no problem.Was almost a month before used the seat on a project.Used the seat about three times and the gas shock will not keep me up.I am an average size person.Looking to return it now, wish me luck now that it is past 30 days.Please look further than this seat before purchasing!"
2,coverseat was received wrinkled,"I received the seat cover wrinkled and was installed then left the cart for a few days to see what happen with the wrinkles, but after few days the wrinkles are still there."
3,shallow seat,The seat is a little shallow it feels like I'm sitting on the edge of the seat all the time. It is also a little tipsy. The tray on the bottom is very handy.
1,"Two seats, broken casters on each in less than 2 months","I had previously purchased a couple craftsman chairs (for a fraction of the cost) for some assembly techs in our warehouse, they lasted about 13 months and both were shot.I decided.... You know what, I'm going to purchase a couple quality seats and be done with this, so I spent 3 times as much and bought two of these seats. I bought them on April 13th 2012, and within one month all 5 casters on each seat are broken.And back they go. Big disappointment."
5,Older Farmer loves it,I bought this chair for my dad to use when he is working on his machinery. His knees are hurting him so I thought maybe I could get him a gift he would actually use. IT WORKED. He uses it all the time and my mom said he loves it.
3,Decent quality but be careful,"Got this item from Amazon a few weeks ago. Selected it over others that looked identical but only had four wheels vs the five this one did.The seat is basically a thick rubberized sleeve but surprised me but it isn't firmly connected to the chair. Not a problem so much once assembled, but you have to keep it on there while you're putting it together. Instructions are sparce, but there are few things to figure out. The only confusing thing was that some of the named parts initially appear to be missing at assembly time, but are actually just attached to some of the larger items shipped in the box and need to be removed to install.The up/down doesn't have a lot of travel but specs as quoted are correct. Just don't expect this to turn into a bar stool.The 'be careful' item is that this thing isn't a free-wheeling creeper you can slide about. It tends to tip when moving so you have to watch it."
2,"American Surfaces, pretentious time capsule?","It's hard to tell how vital this visual diary is in the grand scheme of photography. It's a very personal travelogue. Shore is obsessed with himself and where he goes and what he sees. As a summary of early seventies pop culture it is fantastic. You can find out what people looked like and more importantly, what everything else looked like. I appreciate this aspect of the book, it's a reference guide to 1972. I think some of the photography is top notch but think that the book would be stronger edited down a bit. It's more interesting than the original but packs less of a punch. Could you live without it? Of course. Do you want to? No."
4,A LOVELY SUMMER SCENT,"There are few today who do not know the name Marc Jacobs. His clothing designs have won a loyal following who appreciate his flair and awareness of what becomes women. His designs are understated yet elegant, classic yet innovative.He reflects the same qualities in his fragrances. Of his latest, Blush, Mr. Jacobs said, ""My garden in Paris is permeated with the delicate scent of Jasmine. For me, it is a smell of simple and intense glory - nature in grand performance. I feel a connection exists between this rich flower and the innate power of femininity.""What words could better describe this fragrance? Star Jasmine, which is grown in China and is the richest form of Jasmine, highlights the scent augmented by Japanese Honeysuckle, soft musks and wood notes. It's dreamy, almost tender. Ultra feminine.The bottle is sleek, curved, a blush glass tone topped by a silver cap. Also included in the collection is Body Cream, Body Lotion, and Shower Gel."
2,Shoeless Joe,"Though my grandson loves his batman costume, I am afraid it won't last until Halloween. The material is very thin and the threads are already pulling away from the seams and he's worn it for only one day! That I can take care of. The head mask and cape are a little small for his head, but that's ok, too. It's the BOOT TOPS that have all of us disappointed. The photo online clearly shows a boot covering that completes the total look of the costume.When we took another look at the online photo we can see that the original photo clearly shows boot tops. There is another photo that looks like it was submitted by a customer showing a child in another type of Batman costume without the book tops.However, the packaging that my grandson's costume came in clearly states that the costume includes: jumpsuit with attached boot tops, headpiece with attached cape, belt.I think that you should send us the missing boot tops. That would be the fair thing to do.Thank you."
2,Childs Batman Small,"Sizing was not clear! I ordered the small. Packaging says ""Small 4-6 for ages 3-4 years"". I measured the costume I received and the inseam is 18"". There is no shoe covering. Torso measures about 17"". Belt is foam and ties. Head mask and cape may end up being too small for a 5 year old's head. I ordered from CLICKET and the box arrived in record time for standard shipping. However, the package looked like it was opened before and the costume SMELLS even after a week of airing it out."
3,BONITO DISFRÁZ,"El disfráz es muy bonito, mi hijo ya se lo estrenó en la fiesta del Jardín, le quedó muy bien, en general la compra resultó muy buena."
3,Typical Batman Costume,"These days, kids' costumes seem to be thin pajamas, and this one was no exception. Having said that, it arrived promptly, and it fit my child reasonably well (I ordered a Small, which says 4-6, and also 3-4, whatever that means -- my son is a small 3 1/2 year old). The cape was not, as in the picture, floor-length, but that was a good thing, as he'd have tripped over it. The legs were a bit too long, but they fold up well. And the ""shoe toppers"" were no such thing, but he'll be wearing his own shoes anyway. Typical cheap costume, but nothing other than expected, and good delivery time."
2,Product quality,If I had time to return this item I would. It is a B'Day present for a party this week. I am going to have to mend a sewing error and one of the Batman ears was sewn down and didn't stick up. REALLY!? I am going to have to rip out several seams and correct the sewing. This costume is a real disappointment. This product would be over priced at 1/2 the cost.
4,Fun for Birthday,Grandson loved it and he was so cute playing batman. He is four and he ran around spreading his cape and jumping of furniture. So cute and lots of fun.
2,batman costume: nice design but quality could be better,"Although my son enjoyed it a lot, the costume is a bit too small for him (years old child).The design is nice, but the quality is not really the best"
3,Interesting but flawed portrait of both stars...,"Only until matters are cleared up by Olivia de Havilland--and assuming she will ever finish her autobiography--will we hear her side of the de Havilland story. Joan's ""No Bed of Roses"" was dismissed by one of her ex-husbands with the comment, ""It should have been called 'No Shred of Truth'."" And certainly Higham's book contains all kinds of errors, including a jumbled paragraph that attempts to describe the plot of ""Hold Back the Dawn"" and gets cast and plot mixed up with another film. Nor is he always tactful when characterizing either sister, playing one in an unfavorable light and then reversing his viewpoint with an equally damaging portrait of the other. Finally, it's hard to know just what to believe. Interestingly, Brendan Fraser has bought the screen rights to this novel--lots of luck, Brendan."
4,Spark Innovation in high sesibility performance,"Innovation of high sensibility in a duo of saxo and piano, with Keith Jarrett's reminiscences in his european quartet with Jan Garbarek."
4,Style,This book is a great guide if you want to have more information of what is stylish or not. It gives you an idea of what to wear on different occasions. Even color combination are discussed as well as personal care tips. This book is not limited to fashion. It also covers good grooming and personal appearances on special occasions. You need this if you are going to have a busy social life.
4,A Gem for understanding Crystal Children,This was a helpful book in learning about Crystal children. It contains stories from parents and grandparents of Crystal children. Doreen introduces the reader to the newest generation of sensitives. This book is beautifully written and easy to follow. I read it in one sitting. I found it very helpful with understanding Crystals. She goes into detail of characteristics of Crystal children and how to support them. A great guide.
5,beautifully crystal clear!!!,"In this easy read, Doreen Virtue introduces the next wave of spiritual children (after my generation, the Indigos), the Crystals. The book is mostly comprised of little anecdotes from parents of Crystals, but who better to share stories of the crystals but the parents themselves? This book (as well as the children themselves) is a breath of fresh air, reassuring us that humanity is headed towards a better, more spiritually evolved place. If you are planning for children to come into your lives, please read this book as most of the children coming in now WILL be born Crystal. It's best that we become educated about the new generations now so that we don't see them as being the enemy once they arrive. Of course, how could a wide-eyed baby with a big heart be the enemy, in any context?! Please buy, read, and enjoy this wonderful little book!"
5,Crystal Children,AS always Doreen Virtue explains it in ways that even I can understand. She is a special advocate for children worldwide.
5,Extremely Interesting,This is a very basic informative book. It explains the background and characteristics of Crystal Children nicely. Enjoyed this book.
2,Not enough substance,"I was really disappointed with this book. A very large amount of the text is dedicated to quotes from parents, no other real substance. Every parent thinks their child is special and gifted, this book simply indulged the bragging rights of these parents.I also found that many of the descriptions of the children simply matched well known behaviors for the relevant age group. Having third party evaluations, instead of the parents, would have been more useful."
3,watercolors,I bought these since it was on my sons school supply list and they don't sell prang watercolors in stores. What I got does not look like the colors on the picture. It mainly had different tones of green and blue and odd color of red. Hope they can still use it at school.
3,Not about cooking with cast iron cookware,This is not a bad cookbook but is deceptively titled. It is not about cooking with cast iron cookware.It is touting cast iron recipe success I guess. The recipes are by a British cook and are quite good. Some terms are classically British so you made need to cross reference. Definitely not gourmet cooking but interesting. Again not a mention of cast iron cookware in the whole book.
3,Outdated,"Was in Japan from 1991-2005, initially teaching but later branched out into other areas. This book is extremely outdated and am guessing the 1994 publishing date is actually a later edition as I remember this book from 1990. At any rate, there are plenty of websites that will give you the current lay of the land but be aware that the posters you will encounter are often bitter, negative people. If you want to go to Japan just go and figure it all out later - you'll be fine."
2,I'm not feeling this unit.,"Well I connected this system to my television and cable box 2 days ago. I was really pleased with the look of it. It was also very easy to connect. I put in several CDs and DVDs to try it out. My first complaint is that it takes way tooooo long to load a disk. Everything I put in played...the first day...now there is one DVD that has dts sound and...although this is said to be a dts decoder you need an additional receiver/amplifier to hear dts. I found this to be really strange. A day later I tried to play the same DVDs and CDs and several times I've gotten a ""no disk"" message when there is definitely a disk in that position. I'm going to try it out again tonight but I'm leaning strongly toward returning...and would not hesitate if I didn't have to pay for the shipping. But I want to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I agree with Jaya Schillinger, for the same reasons. I purchased the unit to use as a 5-disc CD changer. Actually, I had to return the first one, which was defective. As Jaya says, it's like having a single-disc CD player. In addition, I have difficulty playing CDs which I burned myself. Fortunately, I can return it to Best Buy, which I'm doing tomorrow."
3,Speakers amazing... CD playinbg not so much,"as others have said, the cd playing part of this product is garbage, however i must say the speaker quality is outstanding and this unit is diehard, i have been using and abusing these speakers for over 6 years and everything works fine. I use them everyday to blast music for the whole house and the big speakers give a natural high quality sound especially since it has a separate tweeter and a base...."
2,UNhappy,"I've always been told to say something nice about someone or something if you have criticisms. So, the sound from this system is good. BUT - - - it doesn't go from CD to CD, has no mute button, and is very slow responding to the remote.The next CD player we buy will only do CD's and not DVD's as well. I want something that works well with the functions I need, without extras that I don't need - - - but that seem to interfere with its basic functions!We've had the system for a year now and, you've guessed it, are UNhappy. (I'll be sure to check out the reviews before my next purchase.)"
5,tug boat of come alongs,The easy to put together was good and minor; the working of the Tuf Tug is great we used it from a bumpper of a truck ball wrapped around a fence pole with a strap to bend back a pole that was dented by vistior truck. I can say with normal wenching pulled the bent pole back into place all is good and the Tuf-Tug easy to release.Also great for the price and operations.
5,Five Stars,"For those of us who do not know the difference between Ayurveda, Chelation, and Iridology, Dr. Isadore Rosenfeld comes to the rescue. In his practical book, Dr. Rosenfeld's Guide to Alternative Medicine, he spells out the difference between these and many other alternative therapies which more people are going to everyday. I wholeheartedly reccomend this work to be on anyone's bookshelf who is even romotely interested in knowing different therapies used today."
2,Medical Dogma,"Clearly, this is a spokesman for the medical profession who is continuing the age-old attack on anything but traditional medicine, either out of ignorance or malice. That maybe harsh for those who give the book a quick read and let the humor brush over the misleading information. For anyone interested in a overall views of alternative medicines you need to read books by individuals not on the complete other side of alternative medicine. The book does do a good job of introducing common alternative methods but is very limited on todays specifics procedures."
1,Chiropractic Patients Know Better,"I was very disappointed in the content of Dr. Rosenfelds book on alternative health. It is clear to me that the millions of Chiropractic patients are more educated about Chiropractic than Dr. Rosenfeld himself. With 66,000 licensed Chiropractors in the United States alone, the terms ""alternative"" have an ever-changing meaning. I would not recommend this book to anyone searching for non-biased information on Chiropractic, or other ""alternatives""."
2,Does Not Know of What He Speaks,"The title should give it away.How could a mature medical doctor, especially one who is such a well-known medical spokesman be anything but medically biased, when disseminating his opinions. Especially regarding those areas which are outside his lifelong discipline.Dr. Rosenfeld also does a great disservice to people when he tries to scare them away from recieving neck adjustments for instance, from a Chiropractor (whom he says ""He loves"", in his chapter entitlted: Chiropractic A Disjointed Theory?). Chiropractic is THE only profession that should ever touch you or your family's spine. No one is more highly trained.If you truly want the standard AMA view on Health, routine or alternative, just look around. It's in every medical office and coming at you in every and all media. Have you seen a pharmaceutical ad today. Be oh so wary."
1,"""Dr. Rosenfeld's Guide to Alternative Medicine,""","Dr Rosentahl needs to brush up on current, unbiased research and provide accurate information. Unfortunaltely he has misrepresented some types of care--both their safety and efficacy and his information is misleading. Too bad for his limited view points."
1,The sins of ignorance,"I was, to say the least, appalled by the views and opinions shared in this trashy piece of slanderous garbage. Clearly, this Dr. Rosenfeld is unaware, under educated, or just plain ignorant to the benefits of proper and prudent Chiropractic care. Even the subtitle of the chapter on chiropractic, ""A Disjointed Theory,"" shows the Doctor's anit-chiropractic bias toward a most beneficial practice.To even suggest that the medical profession considers subluxation to be a ""chiropractic state of mind,"" shows his backward and outdated knowledge of the medical profession as a whole. Fact is, Chiropractic helps millions of patients each and every year feel better physically and live better lives without invasive and expensive surgery and/or drugs.Get off the ancient and outdated band of chiropractic attackers, Doctor, and come into the 21st century. Either do THAT, or say nothing at all, for clearly THIS information is not worth purchasing, reading, or listening to."
1,A typical M.D. view of alternative care,"I cannot comment on most of this book, but I have first hand experience and knowledge of chiropractic and acupuncture, and have found NUMEROUS errors and misinformation about both fields in this book. This destroys any credibility this book might have had.While he pretends to review and even recommend some alternative approaches to health, Rosenfeld merely repeats (ad nauseum) the medical party line that drugs and surgery are best. His statements about the possible side effects of chiropractic, for instance, are ludicrous. Every medical and scientific study done has shown chiropractic to be far safer than medical treatment, which kills more than 100,000 people each year.If you want to learn about alternative care, read a book by an alternative care provider -- not a mouthpiece for the medical and pharmaceutical industries."
3,Turtles Fighting Pizzas? Whudda Thunk It?,"Not actually pizzas, but monsters which hatched from Dimension X eggs posing as meatballs on the Green Team's pizzas, placed by the sinister Baxter Stockman. Speaking of Bax, in ""Enter the Fly"" Krang sends him to the disintegrator chamber, to be (duh!) disintegrated, but a fly buzzes into the chamber and.... Meanwhile the Green Machine are searching for the rare Doku plant, which is their only hope of reviving April after being poisoned by that mean ol' Shredder guy."
3,"Some good info, but hard to find it","After an 18 page introduction to biomusicology the reader is left to sift through the papers of around 25 experts in this field. Quality ranges widely as do the topics. There is some worthwhile information in this book but finding it may not be worth your time. Nonetheless, it is a positive step forward."
5,A Crucial Time in History,"This is a very well written book that interweaves events in England and the United States during the crucial summer of 1940. Norman Moss moves from the top echelons of the leaders to those who lived on the streets of America and Britain. The issues of the period are vividly depicted - the military (the RAF, the sixty U.S. destroyers that involved so much to-and-fro bargaining), social (the struggle to overcome U.S. isolationism versus intervention of some form in Europe) and political (the icons of the era - Churchill and Roosevelt). While reading, one becomes immersed into the mood and spirit of that epoch."
4,An Excellent Read,"I cannot yet speak to the accuracy of this book, as I am only just starting to get into the history of World War II.I can say that I find this book very easy to read overall. While at the beginning the writing style is a little rough (paragraphs are not really tied together, thoughts are at times presented rather abruptly with quick changes in topics) as the book progresses it improves dramatically.I will say that while the Author makes an admirable try at remaining neutral, at times his opinions do become blatantly obvious.Overall, however, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about this period of time."
5,Better than everyone's giving it credit for!,"Though this movie would definitally not be a blockbuster if it was released in a movie theatre rather than on tv; that doesn't make it any less of a movie!I think this movie was great! I loved the music; and the cast, as well. Anyone who is going to doubt this movie before watching it is CRAZY! It's really a great movie; and teaches people (particularly teenagers) things that they would normally be bored by (i.e. the Watergate scandal)! And I think that anything that gets kids interested in the history of the U.S. is wonderful.I think this is a great movie for people of ALL AGES, and I would definitally recommend it to anyone!"
4,awesome!,"I saw this movie on TV, and it was very good. I wish I grew up during the 70's. I learned a lot about the time era, and I highly recommend it. I want to soundtrack, but Amazon is not helping me find it? well just see it! :-)"
3,sort of boring,"I found many of the segments in the '70s either confusing or boring. It focuses heavily on the political spectrum with the numerous protests and the younger generation rising and making a stand against the government, which is all fine and good but there's a couple problems along the way. It's well, boring. Now I normally enjoy this time period tremendously, especially the music (which doesn't disappoint either- several classic tracks such as those from John Lennon and Carole King to name a couple can be heard). The storytelling is either really suspenseful though rushed and unorganized (the police shoot-out in the beginning is the biggest example of this) or we're watching the younger generation rather dreadfully and predictably getting involved in politics. We've seen this all before in better films. And yes, it *does* feel more like the year it was released (2000) opposed to the decade it's trying to portray. Just not interesting enough for me."
5,What about the 80's,"I have both this movie and its counterpart, the 60's and I love them both. They are entertaining and informative and although some may say they are a little long to sit through in one sitting, they keep you intersted and the time flies. My only complaint is that they have not yet come out with ""The 80's"" I am axiously waiting!"
1,Jumbled and inaccurate drivel,"Quite dreadful - it is really worth no stars. I'm watching it now though why I don't know. The music is good but completely wrong chronologically. The actors don't look at all like they are in the 70's. Only the large lapels suggest the 70's rather than the obvious late 90's/early 2000's. Just look at the real 70's footage and compare against the contrived scripted nonsense. I was born in the 60's and so the 70's were very formative - only the news footage bears any resemblence to reality. If you were not alive in the 70's then please don't take this movie to be remotely accurate. Then again, it's probably quite in line with modern news coverage."
5,Great product - perfect for game room or anywhere else,"I recently bought this after looking at a number of different dart boards. Very happy with product. Quality it very high and it looks great on the wall. For the price, your really cant do any better. I definitely recommend and dont understand other negative review..."
1,Arrived in terrible shape,"I've already requested my return slip. The cabinet arrived with green mold all over it, as if it had been wet, but the packaging wasn't water-damaged. This means it was wet when they packaged it originally. Not a good sign. The rest of the finish was blotchy too. After opening the cabinet, we found damaged wood that looked like it had been banged around, again prior to shipping or packaging. With the protective packaging, there's no way it happened during shipment. Basically, the company sent a torn up product. I wouldn't have paid $5 for it at a garage sale."
2,Arrived Damaged,"The product is nice, except that it arrived damaged and I sent it back to get a refund. I'm giving this manufacturer a second chance and ordering it again...will let you know if it comes damaged again. Given the number of reviews mentioning damage, I have a feeling I have a good chance the board will arrived damaged again...The damage was on the finish of the cherry cabinet - the cabinet door was clearly visibly damaged."
3,You get what you pay for....,"We ordered this as a gift and returned it because it was damaged on the inside where the darts rest the tips. Not sure how that could have gone unnoticed before shipping from the vendor, but it did. The varnish/stain was poorly applied and uneven. It was heavy and seemed sturdy enough. The smell of the varnish was very noticeable and I wasn't sure that would go away. It came packed in a gi-normous box that was not well padded and the dartboard box was moving all around in it. I was surprised we didn't see more damage. If you don't mind the imperfections, than you might like this dartboard."
2,very disappointing,"The cabinet finish is much darker than the picture, almost black. The ""chalkboards"" are unwriteable with chalk. The mounting bracket for the board does not allow the board to mount tight against the back of the cabinet. Would not recommend."
2,"Would have been a nice gift, but....","My family ordered this for my Dad on Father's day. My mom read the reviews AFTER I had read it unfortunately. It was a real shame to see my Dad look so excited when he opened it, only to see that the front left panel was damaged, visibly painted badly, and there was damage on the inside of the panels as well. It was still in the huge box that everyone keeps commenting on, I'm surprised they haven't changed that yet due to the many complaints. In fact, due to the other poor reviews about similar damage, we suspect that the same few damaged cabinets may be floating around! Very disappointing. However, UPS did pick it up the next day for return, and if everything else goes smoothly, I will applaud Amazon for their returns."
1,dissapointed,"We should have paid attention to the other reviews. This came to us damaged in 4 different places. I don't understand why they don't package the item better to prevent damage? And the stain on the board was smudged, as if they didn't wait long enough before packing it up."
4,BAD ATTITUDE,Hello....good story. I can relate to this story because I saw first hand what happens/ happened during the Vietnam War
1,Bad News for Bad Attitude,I have read several hundred books by Vietnam vets. I have also read several novels. This one is by far the worst. It really needs to be edited as it has many more problems than I have spece for here
3,A good basic guide,I like the updated version better. The practicality of the information that is provided is on point and on target with what policy analysis ist all abou
5,A policy geek's Bible!,The book is helpful in understanding policy analysis and lays out a meaningful process for looking at smart practice
2,Bad Purchase,"I do not want to say much about this book other than it is overly obvious in what it states. Also, I did not use this book much in my class, which adds to my negative impression of it."
1,It ripped only after one week of use,I was so looking forward to helping my employees avoid burns on their arms as they pulled out the cookie backing racks from our oven. I have a gourmet cookie factory in Argentina and I had tried many different mitts for my employees. This one looked to be my salvation since at first it worked great by covering the arms as they wheeled out the cookie racks from the oven. The mitt ripped open at the base of the thumb rendering it useless. The rack does not have any sharp edges so now I am back to looking for other mitts.
4,Fair portrait of a divisive yet important figure,"As a European visitor on my first trip to the US I was fascinated by the signature of then Mayor Richard M. Daley on so many signs, permits etc. I was also impresssed by the respect and affection many people has for the mayor . This book describes the laying of the foundation of that Daley dynasty by Richard J. Daley. It tends to focus on the machinations of the Democratic Party rather than the benefits Daley brought to Chicago. Not as well writted as Caro's biographies, but still readable. I'm looking forward to reading ""The Boss""."
1,Not worth it,"This biography is shoddily reasearched, loosely referenced and glaringly biased. Mr. Cohen and Ms. Taylor have rummaged through the Tribune, the Times and other people's versions of the story in effort to present a ""definitive"" biography, yet fall well short of the mark. This is not a biography as much as it is an attempt at a vindication of short-term battles that were lost by liberals in post-WWII America.Of course Mayor Daley was a big time politcal Boss who didn't much care for folks different than him, unless he could snag their vote. But you know, Mike Royko already wrote that book 30 years ago. There's nothing new or revealing in this rehash whose only impressive feature is it's length, and that becomes a chore as two shortsighted, copy-inch driven journalists incoherently weave anectdotes together from newspaper clippings and other people's rehashes in secondary sources."
2,"Imaginative names, not very good drinks","Bought this book based upon a recommendation in a magazine. Although it can serve as a very funny counter decoration, the drinks are not very good. We got the most fun out of this book when I invited a bunch of friends over and we just read through the drinks (and some of the recipes)."
1,rip off,"I wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased these programs. I bought programs from grades two through six and not one of the programs work. I cannot believe a company would rip off their customers like this. My money is just gone down the drain, and there is nothing that I can do about it."
3,This has been surpassed forever by his new and astonishing Lucerne Performance,"This was a solid recording but never the equal of his great Berlin performance of 1999 which is one of the best 9th's ever, up there with the Bernstein and Karajan. However, with the new DVD from last year's Lucerne Festival he has surpassed them all with a clear eyed but extraordinary and essential Mahler 9. The Mahler 9 Mahler would not have had the gall to even imagine himself in his own dreams. An astonishing performance due to an orchestra of superstar players who would do anything for Claudio Abbado, a conductor who now knows this score as well as anyone ever did. This Vienna CD is out of print other than in the full Abbado Mahler Box and, I hate to say it; it doesn't matter. Go buy the Lucerne DVD. It is as good as it gets."
3,Nothing Passionate or Promising To Be Found Here,"Kezia isn't a very interesting character, a rich girl who falls in love with a convict. I'm a huge Danielle Steel fan, but I was page skimming about halfway through, trying to find some reason to keep on reading.The entire premise is unrealistic, although given what we now know about the skeletons in Danielle Steel's closet, a rich woman born into comfort and privilege really **did** fall head over heels in love with a convict. So the story may have seemed logical to her when she wrote it, but Passion's Promise doesn't stand the test of time, and is one of her weaker books."
2,Passion's Promise by Danielle Steel,My mother always loved Danielle Steel and she collected as many of her books as she could find throughout her life. She died several years ago and I still have a lot of her stuff. I really like to read and I came across the box of her Danielle Steel books. I've read a few books out of the box over the past few months and Passion's Promise was the latest. I was very disappointed. I really enjoyed the other books I've read so far but I didn't like this one very much. I don't think Danielle Steel spent much time brainstorming and planning the book. She spends a good length introducing Kezia. Then she spends another good length of time talking about Kezia and her love affair with Luke. Then you're almost done with the book and the end is shoved into like 20 pages. I was not satisfied with the ending. It seemed like she spent all this time setting up the rhythm of the book and then suddenly stopping it at the end.
1,"Yeah, right","What I can't stand is people with weird names. What kinda name is Kezia? of course, all of her novels have wird names. Some are really nice, but others stink! PU"
3,Best so far - but could be better,"I enjoyed the book, learned some things I didn't know about the group previously. One EXTREMELY annoying item for me was the author's neverending references to the group as ""da bruddas"". Man, once was enough but it's used over and over for no good reason. Anyway, the best one so far in spite of this."
5,Great Book About a Great group,"This book gives you about all that you want to know about the Ramones. It follows their lives from birth to death and has good coverage of the changing drummers. I also recommend Dee Dee's ""Rock Star"" book but this book is a great overview of the whole band."
1,"Hey Ho, Don't Go","This is the worst rock book ever. Badly written by a Ramone wanna be, Everett True quotes such valuable resourses as fans. True is a professional writer, so you'd expect better things from him, but nope. It's just one more fan wanting to be part of the Ramones history. Unfortunately, this fan found a publisher.Buy the End of the Century DVD. You'll learn a lot more."
3,Don't be put off by the first few pages!,"This book about The Ramones is poorly written and wretchedly edited. It is fraught with inconsistencies that are only sporadically dealt with by disingenuity. The research is questionable, relying on hear-say, jaded and biased memories, and the author's highly personal point of view of the characters.On the other hand, what I have said might well describe the DIY attitude that is punk. Think of this book not as a academic tome on music, but as an oral history of The Ramones. Imagine you're sitting in CBGBs, a beer in hand, listening to the likes of Hilly Krystal, Handsome Dick Manitoba, Johnny Thunders, et. al., talk about the halcyon days. All of what you'd hear wouldn't be right - whether because of what was said or how you heard it - but you'd still wake up the next morning knowing what it was really like to have a front row seat at the start of punk.Hey Ho! Let's Go!"
4,Like Thielemans,"High level of sophistication. Smooth. Not easy to find a musician who plays an strange instrument with convincing skill. But look out, easy listening could be result by moments."
4,Works great,"It's a hard drive, it works. And honestly, I could've bought one from Seagate, Hitachi, Maxtor and the review would probably be the same. When it dies, then I'll have something bad to say."
4,Works great,Works great for computer upgrades...or just to have extra storage space. It's quiet and fast.
1,Avoid This Product,"I purchased this drive 2 months ago. It worked fine for about 3 weeks, then died. It would not spin up. The computer is attached to a high-end UPS, so it was not fried by a power surge. It simply did not spin up one day. I figured that I had bad luck and bought another one. Same story. It worked fine for 3 weeks. I used it today. Shut down the computer. Tried to boot it up again this evening, and the drive will not spin up. That is 2 for 2. Won't ever buy another WD."
5,WD 500GB HD,"Product came in box brand new as expected. It only comes with the hard drive no cables or screws, or any help to prep for use. Therefore, one should have previous experience to intall a HD to use this product. This said, if you know how to install a HD it works perfect, and I'm satisfied with the product. One note on the price. Best Buy sells it at the store for the same price as Amazon, but through Amazon you don't have to pay tax."
3,storage not as advertized,"the drive seems to work fine,it was supposed to be a 500 gb drive but it only has 460gb on the drive raw out of the box icould see a few gb differant but not 40gb,but it is installed now so i have to live with it being 40 gb short....LOL"
4,Hard drive review,"There were no problems with hard drive or JR Electronics. However, there was a huge problem with UPS as they completely screwed up the delivery. UPS compounded the problem by telling me that the driver would come to my house to let me know where he had left the package. After a week of this nonsense I had to wait another three weeks for their ""investigation"" to be completed before another hard drive was sent. A word of caution, require a signature. This way they cannot say the package was delivered when in fact it was not."
1,Disappointing mid-to-long-term results,"I ordered 3 of these 500GB drives between Nov and Dec 2008 to use in an external AMS 4-drive enclosure. I had a good experience with WD drives with some 40 and 80GB lasting many years without problems. However, ALL 3 of these drives started to develop faulty sectors a couple of months ago, just a few months past the one-year date of usage.I could blame the enclosure, but a Seagate 500GB drive also contained shows no such bad sectors and was bought in mid-2007! I understand one can ocassionally get a problematic drive, but three drives purchased within two months?"
5,Western Digital 500GB,"I got my Western Digital 500GB 7200RPM 8MB Buffer Ultra ATA/100, 3.5INCH, 8.9MS Seek, Caviar Series Se Re; I installed it and was very easy; so far so good the hard drive is working fine. I am happy with my decision and the service was as I expected - thanks"
4,Partition Magic 8 Resolved Disk Utilization Under Windows XP,"The drive was easy to physically install. No modification of the pin junctions was needed; it was used as a primary drive in a Data Express key removable drive bay. Reportedly formatted for use with Vista and Windows 7, formatting using the Windows XP Pro Manage function failed to provide access to the full 500 gigabytes of storage. Fortunately, I retained an older copy of Partition Magic 8, which easily adjusted the size of logical partitions to utilize the full capacity of the drive."
5,Superb combination,"Ben Folds and the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. I bought this because I caught his concert in Pittsburgh with our own symphony orchestra, and thought it might be somewhat as good... I was wrong... it was older and every bit as good. Different orchestral style. Ben Folds is the consummate entertainer!"
5,BEN FOLD ROCKS,This is a great live DVD. Ben Folds with a 90 piece orchestra...What more could you ask for. I would highly recommend to any Ben Folds fan or really anyone who loves awesome tunes.
4,Enjoyable and informative (from the XP perspective),"This is a quality book that took a bit of getting used to. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I read a lot of boring and straightforward trade publications and this was a bit different. Ron does a good job explaining the XP methodology while picking up the basics of the C# language. Initially, I was a bit frustrated as I have been using C# for years; however, the book picks up after the first quarter and becomes genuinely interesting -- a phrase I do not often use in regards to technical publications.Areas I found particularly useful included: Unit Testing, nUnit, refactoring and XP in general. I would recommend this book to anyone who has some experience with C# but is new to extreme programming."
1,Extreme Programming Misadventures in C#,"In spirit, the book covers Extreme Programming, but please don't expect the code to hold up. I would say if you want to learn C#, don't write a book to do it. Why should I pay Mr. Jeffries to learn the language (and it is evident that he did not learn it well), and get the same old comments about Extreme Programming that other books have given me?I did find it comical that he states that he likes to keep things simple but when it comes to Xml, he would rather write an Xml parser / validator himself than to use what the platform provides. I guess the next thing we will see now that we have the editor, is a new operating system built from the ground up to prove that we need the editor :).Save your money and buy another book in the series, and Ron... you owe each of us $50 for teaching you C#, but I will take $25 since you didn't seem to get a lot out of it."
4,Cute Snail!,"This snail is really cute - my 18mo old son likes to pull it along behind him. If it starts to get stuck or turned around, he gets frustrated - but then if he pulls hard enough it continues on its way and he is happy again! We've gotten several comments from people about how they like this toy - one grown-up said she would like to have it if our son got tired of it! Great pull toy!"
5,Grammy says this is an EXCELLENT toy!,"This toy is a HUGE hit with my granddaughters! I didn't realize that the snail's body moved up and down so much, which provides sensory feedback when pulling it. The movement is so smooth and funny to watch that it mesmerized the 10 month-old and the 2 1/2 year-old loves pulling it along behind her. Even the 8 year-old took a turn at pulling it around the house, desisting only when 2 1/2 year-old became very insistent. I'm going to order the alligator next and may invest in a second snail, just to keep the peace!"
2,"Cute toy, falls apart",This is a very cute toy. The only problem is that it fell apart after my son only playing with it for 6 months. All that is left is the tail with the string/ball attached. It costs WAY too much to be falling apart so quickly!
5,fantastic pull toy and more,"This is my favorite pull toy my son has. It is so cool how it inches along--I could play with it for hours. My 8 month old got it for christmas and immediately started rolling around on the floor with it, he even pulled it towards him a little bit. He isn't quite ready for pull toys but loves watching us work it. The best part is that you can lift up the head and make it a sort of marionette---so it can nod it's head up and down and look like it is moving it's head around. I think this will make it interesting to him for a long time. It feels kind of like you are walking a dog except it is a snail so I can see him loving it even when he is 3 or 4 and into pretend play!"
5,Just Right!,"I surely appreciate all the reviews of this item! I just couldn't tell whether I wanted to get it or not, and had it on my wish list off and on for a few years! I love yellow, and love it with red and orange. But a snail? Well, as some of the other reviewers explained, it is adorable, both in how it looks and in how it moves.It's a good size, too--not too small, not too big. It's packed well and not too difficult to open.I have a Plan Toys activity bus and a Plan Toy wooden teddy bear that I really love. Looks like this snail is another winner!"
5,Great pull toy,"I broke down and bought this after watching my daughter pull every possible non toy object around the house. Prior pull toys that we have were never entertaining, but this one is excellent."
5,Sweet quiet toy,"I love this! My older son has the alligator by Plan Toys, and it is great but LOUD. This one makes a nice, sinusoidal motion as it crawls along, and isn't completely quiet (it is wooden) but it doesn't clang with each step. I think it is very calming and I love watching the kids play with both of these toys."
5,Old Austria,Hi The Christmas in Old Austria CD came in fine and it was good to do business with you. Thanks
5,beautiful light,This item was delivered quickly. It took a short time to screw on the shade and it was ready to be put to use. Fantastic purchase at the friday sale price. Don't think I'd ever pay full price for it.
3,Close but only half a cigar....,"While this book contains some magnificent photography of this almost unreal place, the photography is not original. The photographs are amazing in terms of traditional 'widely accepted' landscape photography. However in a place as unique as this you really need to go 'outside the box' and go for broke. Too many places have been photographed in this plain, saturated, style. I think the photographers should have tried something different. For what it is, it's a *****. As a book of art it is a ***. And thats what I give it because I am an artist myself. If your more interested in the place and images then the artistic aspect, then I'm sure you'll love it. If you want some real art from this place...checkout Bill Neill, Willard Clay, or John Weller. Those gents were not afraid to actually be creative in Great Sand Dunes."
5,Valley of the Dunes,"This book should be required reading for anyone visiting or wanting to visit the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. The photography is spectacular and the writing superb, providing powerful insight to a landscape that is more complex and varied than any casual inspection could reveal. The only thing better than the first edition is the second edition that not only has new content but improved image quality."
1,Absolutely terrible!,"This isn't worth the amount of paper it took to make the box. The box advertises ""Search by: Animals, Sports, Science, etc."" and makes statements like ""Locate the right image fast!"" and ""Every piece ... is key worded and cross-referenced..."" Yet the Windows software and the Mac software provided for looking at and finding images are just file browsers with absolutely no way of finding anything. The file names are also non-descriptive. Many images are identical with slight variations on colors or rotation. My teenager laughed at the images and said that he could draw better and I don't doubt him. This is a true ""pig in a poke""."
1,Know what you are getting.,"Totally agree with the other reviews.The physical product you receive in the mail is really useless. Disc one contains a software program that should allow you to search the other two discs in the set. Those, by the way, contain wire-framed art (looks rendered back in 1980)and some bad sound effects. So, totally NOT what I was expecting (and thus the poor rating).This is basically paying $39.95 for a one year membership to a great web site that will cost $169.95 per year thereafter.Regardless of whether the value is worth what you get (and it probably is), the offer and product are still not clear."
1,Serious Misrepresentation,I bought this product looking for an inexpensive home clip art collection. What I received was three discs that I basically can't access and a one year subscription to a clip art service I probably won't get my money's worth out of. What an extreme disappointment. The least IMSI could have done was actually stated this is a subscription service you are buying. I will not buy from IMSI again. They don't advertise the truth with their product. I'll stick to Nova. I've bought their product before and they deliver what they advertise. I'll pay the extra money for that. Boy did I get burned!!
1,The Box Lies,"As other posters have said, this product is a subscription for clipart.com, which would be wonderful. I got mine in the mail this morning, I went to clipart.com to register, and was told that the activation code had already been used. So I call Jupider Images (clipart.com) and speak to their customer service representative who informs me that they have ended their partnership with the company that makes this product and that they no longer honor their free subscriptions. So this product no longer includes the free subscription to clipart.com which is where the 3 million and more images come from.Returning this item today. What is advertised on the box is not what you get."
2,breaks alot...have to tune...you have to clean the paintball gun alot,this is a terrible gun...i had low expectations for it but it was just to much than it is worth. i had to get it tunned up and fixed...you have to clean alot since to much air goes to the paintballs and breaks before hitting..it was the worst paintball gun i had...i suggest goin on ebay to buy a used painball gun since it is cheaper and you can get your money back if it goes bad
2,"Starter marker, at best!","I bought this set-up because I wanted a basic marker set that would be intro, noob, starter. The gun is not a bad marker, but by no stretch of the imagination is it a good one. When I took it out on the field for the first time it chopped every ball that I shot. I asked the guys who work at the field about it and they told me that Brass Eagle guns usually require that you use their brand of paint in order to prevent ball chopping. This is problematic since no one of the sporting goods stores near me carry Brass Eagle brand paintballs. I would suggest this marker as either a back-up or for a beginner, nothing more. The mask works great. I'm keeping that dude."
1,Do not buy this gun!!,"I bought this gun for my son who was jealous because I have 2 other good paintball guns. What a disapointment it was when we went out to use this one. Out of every 3 shots we took, 1 of the paintballs would blow up inside the gun and you have to stop everything to clean it out. Once the mess builds up in the gun every shot you take explodes inside the gun. He literaly told me he hates this gun. After the 2nd time we used it the whole cocking mechanism that makes up the inside of the gun got jammed and disconected. I have no idea how to take it apart or put it back together. Total waist of money. Only used it twice and they both sucked. Save your money."
1,stupid gun,ok my first impression was that it was ok but then i went and played with it and paint balls fall out then when you shoot they break if you want to get a good gun get the carver one its maid out of medal and not plastic trust me.
3,How To Make It Big As A Consultant - Offline or Online,How To Make It Big As A Consultant provides you with the basics of how to get started in consulting. When you decide read this book you should be prepared to adapt the advice to specific circumstances in your country as it is focused on operating in a specific region of the worl in regards to tax advice etcA good read but there are some similar and comparative books availableBayo Akinola-OdusolaBusiness Development and Marketing
2,poor overview,"This book is just poor. The information is just light weight, the suggestions on how to sell yourself will make you come across as either an amateur or scam artist. What should be the most important section on contracts is severely lacking. This book is not for people who are actually serious about going into contracting."
3,"Quirky, Amusing yet Unsatisfying","I am a great fan of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction and I'm a great fan of satire.From the reviews, this looked to be right up my alley. But, instead of a fun romp through the end of the world, I found myself plodding through a collapsed US that made little sense (and not in a good way). I was expecting something more along the lines of Matthew Thomas' 'Before and After' Where the entire landscape of the novel is completely over the top.This novel was a bit fractured as it moved from one community to another. It never really felt like there was a coherent flow. Instead, there were different interestingly odd, funny scenes connected together with awkward segues.Finally (and perhaps I'm being picky) the author is British and wrote in a British voice. That's not bad in and of itself, but it was distracting reading about Aryan Nation members going to the loo. On the other hand, I learned quite a few new words - so that's a good thing."
5,Love In The Time of the Apocalypse,"Fascinating way to look at a futuristic arena. Quick paced and keeps reader interested all the way though. Characters are unique! Surprise ending! Humorous content! A relucant hero that encounters many perilous situations. Good,quick read. Being authors Mom I tried to be objective!!!!!"
1,only a few new fights,if your interested in this movie.i wouldnt buy it if u own ufc ultimate knockouts 1 and 2 its basicly all it is besides a couple fights.i hope the first one is better cuz i just got it and have not watched it.
1,Quite Horrible,Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.
2,This video sucks compared to volume 1!,"I bought this video full well knowing that it wasn't gonna be as good as the first one, but it was worst than I thought! The video's only redeeming features are the Shamrock Ortiz fight and maybe the first few fights, but after that, it becomes a snoozefest. If you like non stop action, this probably isn't for you. If you like watching fights where people are on their backs or held against a fence for 80% of the fight, then by all means, pick this one up."
4,Great follow-up to UFC Hits 1!,"This is a good follow-up collection to UFC Hits 1, but as probably expected the first video contained the better fights. Still UFC Hits 2 managed to collect a number of classic bouts of fighters such as Tank Abbot, Pedro Rizzo, Tito Ortiz, Jerry Bohlander, Hugo Duarte, and Mark Coleman. Also features an interview with Bas Rutten.Given the large storage capacity of the DVD format, I hope that they eventually come out with perhaps a cheap, boxed set of the series. Watching a collection of ""highlight"" fights is okay, but for real UFC fans and martial arts afficionados like myself watchingthe entire/unedited fights at times is more thrilling. Not to mention educational. Also, many of the fights in the earlier UFCs, featuring stand-up fighters vs. grapplers, which have high ""eye-opening"" value for martial art practitioners, were notably absent in both videos.Again, this is a great disc especially for those who already purchased the first."
3,Not as good as I hoped,This is good for a beginer. Not for Intermediate or advanced for sure. Good basis to start.
1,Disappointing,"I thought this would be a great concept and opportunity for Bob Greene to motivate through each week of progress. There is very little motivational commentary and advice. A few simple diet rules at the beginning (nothing comprehensive) and then the weekly exercise program. I expected him to include motivational comments and add on additional nutritionally / diet goals each week. But nothing except for the weekly exercise programs. On the plus side, the exercise programs are short and easy to fit into your schedule. They change each week adding more challenge and variety."
1,Terrible DVD,I love Bob Greene's books and watching him on Oprah so just purchased this DVD as it was advertised as a full workout to get in shape but with bonus information. He barely talks at all about getting in shape and some of it is repetitive. On the workout itself I was expecting a get in shape program with lots more info from him instead its lunges...lunges and more lunges and I agree with the previous review about the camera being on him and not on the woman working out. I found this DVD workout boring and the 8 workouts are all the same more lunges!!!! wont be using this again.
3,"Great exercises, but...","PROS: The exercises are excellent, and the DVD is designed to move progressively, with each week's exercises becoming more challenging.CONS: It takes a few times to get the exercises exactly right. The camera is often focused on Bob Greene more than the person who is actually doing the exercise (she's often out of frame). Instead of watching her do the exercise, we frequently see him smugly telling her how many more to do. Also, there are times when she is doing the exercise wrong, but we don't know until he corrects her (more than halfway through). Maybe he was too busy hamming it up for the camera to really be watching.I really enjoyed all of Bob Greene's books, but he really annoys me in this DVD. I'm going to continue to do some of the exercises from the routines, but I am skipping the DVD."
2,BORING! SLOW! And boring.,"I am a week in to the Thirty Day Shred. I started reading online that adding an additional work out will help lean the muscles instead of bulking up (not sure if you really bulk up from it). My husband got Bob Greene's Total Body Workout free with another order he placed from Amazon. ANYHOW...I decided to take a day off of the Thirty Day Shred, and try Total Body Makeover. I was not impressed. I started on week one (it's an 8 week program). I kid you not I thought the whole workout was the WARM UP!! I was so disappointed that it was the actual work out. I right away tried week 2. Still disappointed. Granted, the gal wasn't holding onto a chair the whole time like she did in week 1. Blah. I didn't even break a sweat. I may try using it as my actual warm up before I do my Thirty Day Shred.Thank gosh this was a free DVD."
3,pleasantly surprized!,"I first heard them at a live concert in North Carolina and was impressed, there music is a combination of Flamenco,Latin Bachata,and smooth tunes. It was very refreshing"
5,Sweet and simple push/pull toy,"I was initially attracted to this toy because it's a seal (I love seals). The colors are bright and engaging and very whimsical, which I like. It makes a pleasant clacking noise when my daughter runs around with it and is just the right size for my young toddler (16 months old). This is one of the smaller and lighter toys of its type that I've seen, so it works really well for younger toddlers. Like most Plan Toys, it is simple, sturdy, and fun. Recently, we had a three-year-old visiting and he loved racing around the house with it as well, so I hope my daughter will continue to enjoy it for a couple of years."
3,"It's nice, but...","This is a very pretty little push toy, and my son and I have had good luck with Plan Toys in the past. Unfortunately, when we received this in the mail, I realized that the tail doesn't flap like it's supposed to. There is no bell sound either. So the only thing that it does when you push it is spin the flippers around. I was rather disappointed- I saw it in a store once and the tail did flap on the store model- we must have gotten a defective one- and looking closer at it, the tail needs to be attached just-so in order for it to move with the turning of the wheel. It seems like a slight engineering flaw.I would assume that such an expensive toy from such a nice company would go through some kind of product testing before getting shipped off. Too bad."
2,cute but...,"this is a really cute toy and my daughter loved it when we first got it a few months ago. unfortunately, after a very limited amount of use, it stopped working very well. we can now push it only a few feet before the wheel gets hung up and it won't go any further. when we turn it upside down to try to identify the problem and fix it, there's no obvious problem so it may be a design flaw. Really unfortunate because it's such a cute toy."
4,A sturdy toy,"This toy was a hit for my friend's son who was two when he received this toy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the fact that he could swing it around and hit things with it, including their grandfather clock. Otherwise, she (and I with my son) love this toy!"
4,Paint striper does the job,"The paint striper performed as I expected. The only complaint I have is the handle attachment. The wing nuts on the bottom of the attachment are not sturdy enough to hold the handle in place if you manipulate the handle to move the machine over changes in elevation. Other than that the machine works fine. A few suggestions for prospective users: the striping paint is not effective if there is any wind to speak of ( I built a baffle out of cardboard and tape and it helped a little), the striper doesn't work well over rough terrain, the striping paint doesn't deposit enough material to stripe asphalt in one pass (plan on two passes which will cut your footage per can in half). All in all it does a pretty good job of striping and you will save a lot of money by not paying a professional company to do the work."
4,Howard needs a ponytail and a tatoo!,"The story is irreverent and the characters politically incorrect. No one is immune from lampooning. The book is humorous, right up to the last page. Our protagonist is innocent, something of a fool, sexually confused, and when he changes--he has managed to retain some lovable innocence that endears him to the reader. Hutchison's gallery of characters, including a Chinese Indian who spews ""words of wisdom"" (all of which he attributes to tribal folklore), and a girlfriend with that ""something extra,"" combined with the naughty language and explicit sexual scenes--makes this a must for those of us with a funny bone and a broad mind."
5,Montana Memories,"If you've ever spent any time in Montana and taken in its incredible beauty then you will truly enjoy this wonderful video by Randy Parthe. His photography and choice of music is truly breathtaking and I find myself pulling this DVD out and watching it once or twice a month to get my Montana fix. He has several other films that are available here on Amazon, but he has additional titles as well as fine art prints and greeting cards available on his Persona Recordings website. My own all-time favorite is ""Spring Fever"" filmed in Stillwater County, Montana. We always watch ""Christmas in the Country"" at Christmas time and our entire family loves the brilliant photography and soundtrack."
2,Only a pictorial,Purely a pictorial view of Montana. We assumed this would include information as well. Just beautiful photos and easy listening music. Not really what we were looking for.
2,Clear Crystal Case,Not a bad product. Although I do have problems keeping the front cover on. It doesn't fit tight.
5,LIJ is Excellent,"This CD should be in every Cuban, Jazz, and world music listeners collection. The Live DVD is a full concert. To get both the CD and DVD for this price is a must buy. The concert is filmed in HD and the quality is excelletn"
3,a bit too hard,"this game is very hard, especially the chemistry parts of it. other than that it is another good edition to your cluefinder collection."
3,Okay this book wasn't what I expected it to be.,"I expected total coverage of things about the show, but the book was mainly about strange true things that the show is based upon (ie. the episode about the eng twins is true). I recommend this to readers who enjoy reading background info. The book became boring at times and the writing wasn't that great. The portrayal was not as anywhere as good as the show itself. For real philes this isn't a must buy."
3,"Not a must-have, but an interesting book","If you are looking for a book that explains the X-files, it certainly will dissappoint you. It is not a book about the serie itself, but about the things that makes the creators of the show write every ep. But if you are the curious type (like me), you will be glad to know about alien histories, strange beliefs, and so forth. Even thought I bought it expecting a deeper involvement with the serie, it came to be an interesting book."
5,"Truth is stranger than fiction, and more fun too","This book dates from the end of season 2, so if you're a fan, it won't tell you much about The X-Files that you don't already know. But the real point of the book is that the synopsis of each episode jumps off into a medium-long article discussing the science and history surrounding an issue or two in that episode. There's a load of cool stuff in this book, on subjects like chromosomes, forensic science, hypnosis, various folklores, the CIA, the circus,and what might happen when you get shot in the head. It's all interesting and fun to read, and will take you right back to how exciting it was when the show was just getting started. I only wish Ms. Genge had written similar books covering the other seasons!"
5,Great Theory to learn court reporting,This book is great for learning to be a court reporter. It teaches a computer compatible theory that is one of the easiest and quickest theories to learn if not the easiest.
3,Signed Sealed Delivered--Gold City,"I did not find the quality or words of most songs to be of high quality. Bill & Gloria Gaither set the standars that I use. The record did not meet my ""high"" expectations. The Cathedrals far surpass this group."
2,doesn't work,"This works for a few days holding down the carpets, but then it stops sticking and the carpet doesn't stay... we use this for the small rugs in our entrance, and at the bottom of the stairs..."
2,2 sided rug tape,"I bought this to secure an entry way rug in our office. The back of the mat is rubber and it was to secure it on berber. The tape stuck to the berber, but not the back of the mat. But then neither did the industrial strength velcro I tried. I would only use this for carpet to hard surface. Not really heavy duty use."
1,doesn't work,"This tape does not stick at all, it for sure doesn't stick to a rug, but I am too lazy to return it."
5,Best Carpet Tape On The Market,"We moved into a new house which had white carpet (a nightmare for a family with 3 kids under 5). Needless to say the carpet it no longer white so we bought a large area rug to cover up stains. I tried every kind of carpet tape that my local hardware stores had, and all of them failed within 2 weeks (many of these were name brand).This is the only carpet tape on the market I have found that will easily hold carpet to carpet for 3+ months."
5,Works well,"We were having issues with our 5x7 carpet staying in place on our Pergo-type floor. This had good reviews so I bought some. It works. I've had this down for about 6 months now and the carpet hasn't moved at all, even with 2 big dogs walking and playing all over it everyday. Recommended."
2,doesn't stick,I used this tape for a rug that was curling back at the edges. The tape works for a couple of days but then the edges curl back again - the stick doesn't last. I wouldn't purchase it again.
1,Bad tape,"I used it on a runner which i put on a carpet.too keep dirt from tracking in more. Now maybevif input it on a hardwood floor, it might have worked. Oh well, il try something else."
1,Beware of useing on Hardwood floors,I have area rugs all over my house because I have 2 large dogs that can't stand on hardwood without falling. I bought this after reading the review where the lady used it on hardwood floors and it hadn't moved. She might want to check for any damage. I called the company and spoke to a technician and he told me that it could possibly cause damage to my hardwood. That was all I needed to hear.
3,Not good enough for me but not bad,"I bought this carpet tape to keep my rugs in place. I bought the rugs to protect the carpet in strategic locations in my rented apartment. Strategic means areas where I am more likely to stain the rug like under and around the dining table.The good news is that there is a lot of this tape so you can use it liberally. The bad news is that my rugs still manage to shift on the carpet by a little. It is visible because I did put two rugs side by side and they drift apart with the time, even with the tape.I still give it 3 stars because I am not sure if there is better out there. I do not want to use one that may be so strong that I would end up damaging the carpet I was trying to protect in the first place. I believe (hope) that this tape would perform much better if I had tried to secure my rugs on hard floor."
2,Rug Tape - Didn't Work for Me,"I have outdoor carpet in my garage area and used this tape on the back of some scatter rugs and the rugs still shifted, did not stay in place. After reading some of the reviews I really thought this tape would work - disappointed."
3,Carpet Tape from Amazon,"This tape is good for small tasks, such as hemming curtains, however it was not suitable for my large carpet pieces, which I had hoped to set down over existing carpet. This was not because the tape was no good; it was because the existing carper is too smooth so there is no grip, and they are too heavy to stay in place. They will actually need to be tacked/nailed down. I am reluctant to do this, nevertheless, as I do not want to do any damage to the existing carpet or floor beneath; I am renting the premises."
4,Good basic carpet tape,I needed some carpet tape to keep carpet pads in place on our wood stairs. This did the task fine with two strips per pad. Only problem was figuring how to peel off the backing! Googled it and discovered that you have to make a shallow cut (with Xacto knife) on the end of backing. This will allow you to peel off a small portion of the backing and then stripping the rest off is easy!
2,Carpet tape 9970,This tape is not sticky enough to hold a carpet square so I can imagine that it will also not work with an area rug. Not at all worth the money.
1,two sided tape,"Very hard to remove plastic to expose stickum, when I moved the rug all the tape stuck to the floor, had to be thrown out. also the rug moved and balled up rendering the tape useless"
1,Does not work!,This tape was advertised to stop slippage on any surface. I used it on runners over hard flooring and carpeting. We are tripping over these runners all the time - very annoying and dangerous. Do not waste your money.
4,Did the job,I used this to apply carpet pads to my indoor wooden steps. The only difficulty was peeling the backing paper off. Doing the trick though.
4,Intertape 9970 Indoor Carpet Tape,Served the purpose that I needed it for. The only problem is peeling the backing off. Tried cutting it on an angle but it does take a lot of patience to get it going.
3,What it will and will not do,"It will not stick to area rugs with a sealed back (looks like a real piece of carpet on the back)If you use a lot, it will stick a rug to your regular carpeting. Cover a large area of the rug with tape--not just the edges--and make sure your tape is as close to the edge as possible. I have not had any problems with damage to my regular (wall-to-wall) carpeting in that instance, because it's not sticky enough to do anything.In sum, the ideal use of this tape is for securing an area rug to hardwood or tile."
5,does what it says,"We used this not for holding down rugs but for our rocker recliner that would scoot around on our carpeted floor. We would have to drag the chair back into its place at the end of every day but we bought this applied it to the underside of the platform bottom of the chair and voila, no more scooting chair!!"
3,good,"Over the past year I have really come to love Henry Mancini, and each soundtrack I have explored, slowly delving into this master's work, I have loved. This includes Breakfast At Tiffany's,, Wait Until Dark, the Mr. Lucky TV score, and even the later, expectation shattering Life Force.What Did You Do In The War Daddy is my least favorite yet. That does not make it weak. The title, of course, implies a throwback, and even for 1966, this is. There is a lot of Polka, some smaltzy 1920s jazz, even a march.None of the blues Mancini signs many soundtracks with is here. In and of itself that is fine, it would not fit. But Mancini does not do much fresh with the throwback styles he uses here. Any decent arranger can replicate these styles, but I love Mancini so much, I expect a unique twist.That never emerges here. For what this is it is fine, but for Mancini, it is sub par."
4,Pretty ring - fun to wear!,"Received this for mother's day...nothing easier for hubby than circling the items I like in the Ross Simons catalog. This ring is very pretty on, just like the picture. Fits well, and tons of sparkle. There is a great deal of wow factor for this ring, I've had lots of comments on it. I like it overall very well, at least until the lotto comes in and I can afford the real deal!"
5,What a variety!!,"My three year old son loves bulldozers and any other construction equipment. He had a bulldozer video that was his favorite until I bought this one. He absolutely loves it. The sound quality isn't the greatest, but that doesn't matter to him. All that matters is seeing the different construction equipment in action. There's a huge variety to see too. Some are ones that I've never seen before like the underground ""Mole"" which digs huge tunnels for like subways. The box reads for ages 2 to 80 and its true. My husband and myself found it quite interesting and entertaining. Hard Hat Harry does get a little silly at times, but you have to remember it is based for children.I highly recommend this video if you have a little construction guy or girl at home. Who knows...maybe you'll end up like us and enjoy watching it yourself."
1,Extremely bad print!,Received it yesterday. It is recorded in LP mode. The copy has both picture and sound problems. There is noise on the picture that cannot be tracked away (top of the line Sony VCR). It is like a home video recopied 5 times using bad equipment. The contents are fine but do not deserve a rating of even one star because of these problems.
1,hard hat harry is such a total bore !,"although the construction facts he endlessly spews are undoubtedly accurate, the handsome genie otherwise known as hard hat harry is terribly boring and indescribably dry, not funny at all-- the world might be a better place if he would go back inside the old construction thermos from which he came, at least for a few thousand more years.. ..stick with the Road Construction Ahead/Farm Country Ahead series, even Construction Foreman Dave of There Goes a Bulldozer fame has more style and panache (and that's saying a lot) ..don't believe me ?? then trust my two-year old, he's hit the eject button on hard hat harry each time !"
4,"Should be a required reading book, part of world heritage.","Although a translation, and we know that all translations pale in comparaison to it's original, it should be a required reading book for anyone under the age of 18. Just like The Art of War, by Sun Tzu. Although they are unique to their individual gender, these two books should rest in everyone's library."
2,Biography of Joyce Kilmer,"I enjoyed this biography of my grandfather, Joyce Kilmer, when I was about thirteen years old."
5,Stacy's Mom,"Very real view of students in that age group. Theactors well well suited to their roles and the entireproduction was first rate. Many memorible scenes which will last forever! In short, we enjoyed it."
3,Mediocre,"This Album of Pino de Vittorio is not bad, but it's not good either. The musicians' are technically skilled, but seem to lack emotional understanding and passion. Also, some of the tempi are far too slow. I recommend Christina Pluhar's album ""La Tarantella"" if you want a dazzling and energetic interpretation of Tarantelle.La Tarantella: Antidotum Tarantulae"
5,Great in the background,I looked for this item for some time and was happy to find it. The music is beautiful and is definately full of good energy.
4,another slept on cd,"i bought it when it first came out and didn't really listen to it, but once i did i enjoyed every track on it. it's a very sexy album."
2,"2 1/2 stars - He's got the ""pain"" part right","Tank - Sex, Love & Pain (Blackground, 2007)The problem that I have with Tank is that although he is a force when he writes for other artists like Aaliyah, Jon B. and Jamie Foxx, he stumbles when it comes to his own albums. The lead-off single is usually the only good song on the album (""Maybe I Deserve"" from Force of Nature and ""One Man"" from the album of the same name) and this case is no different.""Please Don't Go"" is the winner from this album but another good song is ""My Heart"" and that's about it. This album suffers from mediocre lyricism and a certain skit that goes on and on with no point. Though he's from my hometown (Milwaukee), I can't even show any bias towards him. I advise all to borrow before buying unless you're a fan. -EJR"
2,Ummm...,"I was disappointed with this album. I ecxpected much more from Tank being that he's a great producer and songwriter for other artists. And lack of promotion didn't help!! He's had ""Please Don't Go"" single out since Novemeber/December. Unless anyone has heard a second single on the radio? Maybe this album will grow on me..."
1,better stick to taking shirtless photos. He can not sing.,"Why is he still putting out CD's? I am not hatin on him because lady's like they way he looks. I just do not like his voice, and he can not sing! Do you call this singing? Someone let me listen to the CD (yes it was a female) and I can not get pass the first 3 songs. I saw one of his videos and he can not dance. He is not a performer or singer! They play his song on the radio, and he sounds like Keith Sweat on a bad day ""Live""( we know he can not sing, just beggin all through the cd) Do not buy this Cd, unless you just like looking at CD cover. I do not have any thing positive to say, but perhaps he might hit the gym to keep in shape?"
5,FIRE!!,It was a long time coming...but this joint is well worth the wait. I agree with the other poster who stated that they were glad Tank stayed away from the Hip-Hop'esque tracks. Tanks vocals are what I like the most about him...really a rarity among R&B artists these days. You hear a lot more versatility in this CD than what he has shown in the past. This one is definitely a MUST HAVE!!
4,"This is a good year for R&B, Tank is one of the reasons!!!","Tank came real on this new album. I must say he put his heart into this album because it's really good. Production is good, lyrics are good and voice is on point. Tank along with Joe and R.Kelly contribute the necessaries to the R&B world and although underated, I think this album will help people to really know who Tank is. Well done."
3,Left alot to be desired,"Anticipated this album so much, but it turned out to be a let down. Most of the songs sounded the same, you would think he would write himself a lot of #1 hits as he has done for others but it just wasn't the case here. I really gave it a 3 because I still think he is so sexy."
5,DaBomb son,"This Cd is off the meat rack this is the best Cd out there, and this is my first Tank Cd I have ever owned. Go copp that !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,TANK IS BACK (4.5 STARS),"I THOUGHT THE TRUTH WAS SOMETHING I COULD TAKE, BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO FEEL LIKE A HEARTBREAK...THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY POWERFUL LYRICS THE GRACE THE TRACKS OF THIS HOT CD. I ENJOYED THIS ONE A LOT MORE THAN I DID FORCE OF NATURE, THE CD BEFORE THIS ONE. HE HAS SOME GOOD SONGS ON HERE, AND YOU CAN LET THE ENTIRE CD PLAY. I SKIPPED LIKE TWO SONGS, BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS ON POINT."
2,"Hmm, not much here",I'm so sorry but this album did nothing for me. I keep buying his albums and he keeps having like a good 3 songs on each album that I totally love. I dubbed a copy and sold the orginal.There may be someone out there that likes this album but it just wasn't working for me.Sorry.
3,Good workout....but,I like this workout but I find it to be hard on my wrists. I don't mind plank work but I think there is too much in this video so I don't use it often.
2,Yeesh,"Wow. This workout takes a toll on your wrists and shoulders. Twenty straight minutes or so are spent in a plank position, which puts way too much strain on your wrists. I would assume over time you could build up the strength to complete the entire DVD without an overuse injury, but I'm not sure if I want to risk it. I do like the emphasis on shoulder stability, however, as I could see I needed some more work I this area. Buyer beware, however, if you aren't use to barre or Pilates type workouts, ease into this series with other DVDs (Ive done Physique 57 for over a year, Pure Barre, Tracey Mallett, Core Fusion (great for beginners), etc.) Overall, I'll have to give it another try but first impressions weren't terrific."
4,very satisfied,I like how it works not only the upper body I also feel it through my whole body with out having to use weights.
3,good arm workout,While this is a good arm workout it is not my fav Leah dvd. It is a long workout to concentrate on upper body only.
1,Not good for wrists & WAY too much shoulder workout,"I have been practicing barre discipline for over 4 years now at least 4 times a week and have over 20 videos as well as taking studio classes. I REALLY like the lower body workout video but this one has WAY too much shoulder workout and no bicep workout in the entire video. If you have any wrist issues at all, skip this one. Lower body video is well worth it though!"
5,one of the greatest song and melody writers,"I had first heard his hauntingly georgeous, stand-out songs,on lyle lovett's ""step into my house"" cd, and then experienced the genius's work in this album. here is a songwriter of incomparable talent giving us the blue print for eternal gems to be heard throughout time, irregardless of what voice sings the song. his melodies are immortal. a poet of the soul expressing through music."
4,good compilation,"As you can see from the above review Townes van Zandt isn't for everybody, but if you can get on his wave length you will be richly rewarded. His songs about deeply felt abstract pain are perfectly constructed and while his voice is not the best in the world, it is very expressive and sad. While there are better compilations of Townes' songs available and the original albums are better still, this one is a good place to discover an American original."
4,Great Basic Start!,This book is a great start to a person interested in Music Therapy. The outlines of the treatment were a great help. The only thing I wish were included were certian techniques they used.
1,Thoughtless Production,"For seat covers costing more than your local Auto store ""one size fits all"" kind, these Saddleman Windsor seat covers aren't much better. They cover up rear seat pockets and encase both storage consoles of the front seat ""middle"" seat of Doge Ram Quad Cabs. Their on-line questionaire ignores your answers that the console has storage in both the top and the bottom of the seat-console. Therefore, they are not ""Custom"" at all."
5,Virtuostic,"If there were ever any doubt that the Saxophone as a musical instrument came into its own during the 1920's and 30's, this record of transcritptions and original source materiel should dispell it. The players on this record are absolutely first rate and some reach virtuostic levels of performance. The meticulous level of detail that obviously went into every aspect of this project is makes my brain hurt. I think anyone might feel the same after hearing this but particularly a serious musician and even more particularly a serious Saxophone player. The woodwind doubles and use of the Oboe in particular as a ""popular"" solo voice is also a very new sound to me and is here rendered beautifully. Also, from the perspective of arranging, these have to be some of the best I've ever heard in this genre. 5 stars and hats off again to the Beau Hunks!"
4,well executed but dry recording,"This recording was a labor of love and it shows. All the players are in top form. If you love saxophone music of the 1930s, then do not hesitate. The recording is somewhat lifeless however. The mics used are directly over the heads of the ensemble. As a result there is no hall ambience and, for me, that was a little off-putting. Think of a group of saxes playing in a closet. Many of the Beau Hunk small ensemble recordings come off this way and it may be an artistic choice. Other than this observation (which is my sole reason for not giving a five star rating) you have a well played group of original transcriptions."
5,Great Book For New York State High School Students!,"New York State Education Department, Board Of Regents make up every year very hard English regents Exam and it's most important exam to graduate from high school. That exam being graded by 6 rubrics rules. This book is great to learn what English regents requires and to take sample tests and to learn your mistakes before actually taking actual Regent Test. Help yourself to pass English regent buy this book. Good Luck!"
3,Disappointing,"Whilst this book is informative, it is not an inspring read. Also the nature of the book doesn't allow for much depth on the subject."
5,A memorable and entertaining story,"Mullen is a quaint little village set deep in the forests of the Old World and nestled up against high, snow-capped mountains. With its cobblestone streets and brightly painted houses, the villagers should have been happy. But singing, laughter, or any other kind of merriment was rarely heard. It seems the people of Mullen were sad and worried. Even the wise Clockmaker couldn't seem to help them -- until one night, when the clock didn't chime. A memorable and entertaining story penned by Jamison Escott and charmingly illustrated by Esther Escott, The Clockmaker Of Mullen is imaginative, charming, and an enthusiastically recommended picture book story for children of all ages -- and many a parent as well!"
5,great product,"This is a must to take on your dive trips. You might be the spartan type and only take the PADI book, which is fine. But this zippered 3 ring binder will hold the water-proof pages PADI log book and all your personal items. Has a large mesh pocket in the back, good place for laminated dive tables or what ever. Has a snap-hook for keys or? The front has 3 places for pens, a velcro closure for loose or important stuff and 10 slots for credit card size cards, ( id cards, certification cards, medical cards, contacts you meet, etc). Zips shut and water resistant, not water-proof (water will leak in around the zipper) so don't drop it in the water, but it will float for a short time.Measures 8"" x 11"" x 1 1/2"" so it will fit in any gear bag. Comes with replacement dive log pages, but they are of lower quality. That is, the pages are small and are not water-proof. I use them only for note taking. As I said before, get the PADI Diver's Log Book to put in this organizer.PADI Diver's Log Book"
3,Very plain - disappointed it was not as pictured,"We ordered 5 dive log books for our family and this was the only one that did not come with the tabs. This organizer only came with the dive log sheets only. The tabs and other pages give it a little more stability when writing. Was very dissapointed that the item was not as shown. We ordered it because of the dolphin pictured but when we received it, there is nothing but a small logo on the bottom corner...no picture at all. The construction is the same as the others but is just too plain for my taste."
3,Collection,This is a good collection of famous papers about time-series and econometrics. Good as a reference guide not as a theory book.
3,Nice alphabet tracing and review,"This was nice, but I thought we would get more for the $10 price tag. It works well for our 5 and 3 year old. The 5 year old does the writing and the 3 year old uses it for letter recognition and drawing."
4,"tiny, chirps like a bird","Great design, fits in a shirt pocket. Can loop and join various beat patterns - fun to play with. Internal speaker tiny with slightly unpleasant chirping sound, but audio out can power earbuds or preamp for better sound."
4,My Review,"This is a nice metronome but it is weak on volume, it is not loud enough for me. If you run it through a stereo system or an amplfier then you get the volume you want. But besides that it does what it is suppose to. I would buy another one if needed.UPDATE: I took off one star because of the volume, it should be louder."
2,Stopped working after 2 months,"Unfortunately, this metronome stopped making sound on the main beat and on the tuning note after 2 months of gentle use. Too late to send back to Amazon, still within warranty. But of course now I must pay for the shipping and take the time to send to LA for Boss to repair, and be without a metronome for 2 weeks.Other than that, I've really liked this metronome. Has some very nice features. Not impressed by the 90-day warranty, though. I think a product that costs this much should have a 1-year warranty at least."
4,Great practice tool for any musician,"Is this a discontinued item by Boss? I'm a little out of the 'loop' on these things since I've only just now had to replace my last Dr. Beat after it provided me with nearly 20 years of unfailing service--it was finally stolen when I accidentally left it, and a pair of drumsticks, in my building lobby...they left the sticks and kept the Dr.Beat =-(I'm getting to know this fascinating device and enjoy, thus far, all of the features. Nothing seems extra, silly or useless (no voices, talking, etc., like the newest DB's). My only question (if you have an answer please email me at greg underscore b ""at"" macdotcom) is: the main click seems to have a slight ""flam"" effect ... am I nuts or is that really the case? It's really subtle, and so far doesn't seem to affect the usefulness of this metronome, but ... just wondering ... )."
5,We NEED This on CD!!,"I just happened to pull out my old 1980 low-fi Thorn EMI VHS of this little gem and gave it a spin. This was one of my favorite soundtracks from the era. I don't have the vinyl edition anymore. Please, please, please: We need this film on CD and remastered DVD. As a film, it's not a great work of art by any stretch of the imagination, but the soundtrack kicks butt and takes names and Robin Johnson is astounding in one of her few lead roles."
4,Great book!,This book arrived timely and in great shape. It was a wonderful book to read! I rarely ever read short stories but these were lovely.
4,A Good Sequel to Spellfire,"I thought this book was better than most other people judging by their reviews.It builds the characters back grounds & shows their maturing.I'm partial to the Harpers & Knights of Myth Drannor who keep popping up to save the day.Read SPELLFIRE first then this book,it will make more sense & together they present a good story.Others mention how weak Narm is as a magic user,in the first book he was in AD&D terms a first or 2nd level magic user,in this book he casts a lightning bolt spell,(that's a spell you can only cast at 5th level or higher)He's gained 2-3 levels since the first book,not to shabby... Not everyone can be Elminster or Khelben Blackstaff...."
2,Greenwood goes megalomaniac again,"Oh no. Another book about the godlike Shandril. The innocent maiden slaying her enemies by the dozens, hundreds, thousands ? It is just boring to read about an invincible girl and her special power. Why did I read it in the first place ? Maybe I hope that Greenwood will create some characters one day, in which can actually ""believe"". Up to now I can only laugh about the good ones of his novels and always side with the bad guys, because they never have a chance."
1,WAAA help me!,"Are you shure he is athe great writer? Why all his grate caracters wait till all'll be killed, and then strake back with all there great power, and all evil fell."
1,WHO said Greenwood is a good writer?,"Here we have another suckage by Ed Greenwood, the only writer who sucks more than Zahn (and who is equally praised by paranoid monkeys err american readers) the heroes are totally cardboard, the storyline is wicked and nonsensical, the dialogs are idiotic. I don't know why Greenowood has such esteme and fame, yeah I know he started the entire Forgotten stuff, but he is grease under feet of Salvatore or Cunnigham. After reading any of his novels you are close hating entire FR setting. I've read several of his novels and shortstories, they all sucked but this one is WORST of the worst, and that really means something. Ed please we beg of you, STOP WRITING."
1,one of the worst novels ever written,"Dungeons and dragons novels are usually bad, but this one is exceptionally bad. This novel features bad prose, irritating characters, and unbelievably stupid villains. Take for an example the beholders. These monsters are supposed to be inhumanly smart, yet they keep shooting magic at Shandril, who absorbs it and shoots it back them. They keep doing it until they entire pack is destroyed. The novel is mainly fighting, interspersed with poor dialogue. How does one feel when reading it? '""Tired. When I said I was sick of endless battle,"" Shandril told him grimly, ""I meant it.""'"
5,Good album,"This is a cool album. Especially the tight song featuring Juve thats called ""Hold Tight"". Overall its a tight album"
3,Loved the concept but a mundane execution,I enjoyed the theme and plot of the movie. The actresses were hot and so was the plot. But the execution of said plot and a not so great script along with tepid directing and acting makes this one okay.
1,I paid 88 cents for this?,"I paid 88 cents for this and was totally ripped off. What a joke! This has to be the worst acting, script, camera-work and editing on the planet. I don't want to see naked women with plastic inserts. I wanted to see a horror flick. It was a horror...just replace the ""or"" with ""ible"" and you hit it right on the head. HORRIBLE!"
1,bad company do not order!!!!!!!!!!,they cancled my order for no reason and couldnt even e-mail me to let me know so needless to say this fatherday gift didnt turn out so well
3,Decent Apron,Somewhat thin quality however i do use this everytime i grill or risk getting dirty i the kitchen. For a cheap apron its a good deal.
2,Pretty cute but see through!,"The item arrived on time, and overall is pretty cute, but even when I opened the box I could see that it was VERY see through. The blue tie was folded under the white front and I can very clearly see the tie through the front of the apron.Cute as a little novelty gift but if you're looking for quality I'd look elsewhere."
1,Looked great until........,"Really liked this Cowboys Apron, looked great when I first got it. But when I washed it for the first time, the decals of the Star and some of the letters began to shred apart. I followed the washing instructions on the apron, but it was just a bad printing job. For that reason, I would not recommend buying this item."
1,Very bad sound and quality,The sound and picture quality of this DVD is very poor. I love these singers but this concert is just noise and does not make justice of them at all.
2,NO LO RECOMIENDO!!,"la calidad del audio y el video no es muy buena, no lo recomiendo..HERMES FLORES C."
3,Not too exciting,"Well I can't say I really knew what I was buying, but I needed a gift for a friend of mine who adores Latin music. He wasn't too excited with the disk, unfortunately."
4,Chest Guard,This is inexpensive chest guard that is good for most Martial Art applications. Product is as described. Make sure you get the right size when placing order.
4,Short and Sweet,"This book, as the title indicates, is a commentary on Lewis's views on Scripture. It locates itself within the innerancy debate that raged most strongly several decades ago in Evangelical Christianity. But the book remains relevant today for those interested in the views of Lewis, not only on Scripture, but on literary inspiration in general. Some Lewis scholars have rated this book rather low, but I found it to be quite helpful and, from my present research and knowledge on Lewis, accurate."
5,Great speakers - Great Seller,"Purchased these to round out my system. I previously had Sony Xplod 4 way speakers which, though they sounded clear, were a bit harsh and heavy on the high end. Personally I think a supertweeter is overkill. The Alpines, for 5.25s put out an amazing amount of sound and are much warmer than the Sonys. They were also easy to fit into the doors of my truck though I had to snip out some slots for the support brackets with tin snips. For reference, my rear speakers are Alpine SPS6C 6.5s. Both sets will handle the max volume from the head unit (Alpine CDA9883) with little or no distortion. I don't need richter scale bass response but I do like some solid bottom end and I think most users will be happiest with some sort of subwoofer. I have a powered Boss sub from Amazon which rounds the system out perfectly."
5,Alpine SPR-13C,"Great seller!!!! I order the Alpine SPC-13c a week before Christmas. When I finally had a chance to install it (someday in Feb.), it was completely the wrong size. My car insert was 6x8, and the speader was 5-1/4. Stupid crutchfield.com told me they will fit. Oh well, I contacted the seller. He said it was no problem, just send it back and he'll send me the right size. The speakers arrived less than 4 days. He kept in contact with me until the transaction was complete. Will definitely do business with seller again. Once again thanks for everything."
4,MS Windows XP Full Edition,"Product is great - works just like it should. Arrived quickly - like it should. I wish I didn't have to buy it twice, however. I first tried to purchase it from Tech For Less on Amazon - I received an OEM version with no product key. Received no replacement or refund from that seller. So I had to purchase it AGAIN - I chose to purchase it from Amazon, expecting that they would at least honor their own refund policy. Too bad they don't back up the sellers' return policies they let 'sell' on their site."
3,XP on a MAC,"I bought Widows XP to run on a MAC under Parallels. This full version works perfect. It seems to run faster on the MAC than my old PC. Parallels requires a full XP version, that is why this one costs more. It is worth it if you want to run Windows software on a MAC. I am happy with the way this works. You can actually 'cut and paste' between the two operating systems in Coherence mode."
3,Overpriced Microsoft strikes again,"I think the title says it all. It worked perfectly, easy instructions etc. But I can't for the life of me rationalize spending upwards of $250 for a standard piece of plastic with some foily stuff on it and a glossy cardboard sleeve.While I recognize the prowess and legacy of microsoft os's in general, I wish by now they would stop ripping off their consumers for many-year-old software or even just software in general. I'm not criticizing the product so much as I'm criticizing Microsoft's bad (or good, depending on which cushy leather office chair glossed with the blood of the poor you're sitting in) extortion of the american public. Smart business, or squeezing us dry?"
2,Activation Code For Windows XP,"Since people are selling used copies of Windows XP, what I haven't seen addressed is how do you use the Activation Key if this product has already been used. If you don't have a Valid Activation Key for this product, you will have a locked up computer after 30 days, unless you purchase a NEW, VALID Activation Key!"
1,product key did not work,product key did not work and this software of XP is toooo expensive. returned it once the product key did not work.i went to a local computer shop and bought an XP with SP3 for 60 bucks.
1,Invalid Product Key,"I bought this item and when I tried to Install it, the Product Key was not valid, so I ended up buying nee Product Key from a different site."
1,Win XP Full Version vs Win XP OEM new pc version,The software illustrated shows a full version of Windows XP in a box. The software sent was an oem disk with authenication. An attempt to load resulted in failed files. Reloaded the pc with Vista which loaded without any problems. Returned the software with the help of Amazon.
1,Microsoft does not provide updates anymore! Do not buy!,"Ok people,You know those Window's Update patches Microsoft sends out? Those protect you from ""hackers"" and ""viruses"". Since XP is more then 10 years old, Microsoft will be soon stopping these updates. You will literally be left alone and by yourself with no protection from some of the worlds best hackers. Heres some information for you. ""Hackers"" have programs that will tell them what OS your using. When they see XP, they will get into your computer, and from there, the possibilities for them are endless!Please, if you need more information or need help upgrading, send me a message at ""leclercben1 @ gmail . com"" or comment on this post. I would love to help.Thanks,Ben Leclerc"
3,Does what it is supposed to do,I spent the extra money to buy the retail version. Needed it for some apps that do not run on MAC OSX Currently running it on Paralles Desktop 3.0 for MacThe install was real easy.
4,Windows XP full version,"I purchased this to use on my MACBook. Being a MAC person, I was afraid of getting VISTA, glad I was able to get the XP version."
3,Just a warning,"Someone mentioned that with XP the ""blue screen of death"" is no more. This is actually false. While the ""blue screen of death"" does not happen often, it does happen. Except it isn't just a matter of restarting the computer, as it just pops up again and again and again until you reformat your computer (and lose everything). Just a warning for anyone, but overall XP is a very well thought out product and has a great interface that's similar enough to old editions, but with a modern flair."
2,Necessary evil.,"I had to work with a pc and windows because of my profession......architect.. My firms have always used architectural desktop. Unfortunately, it only is compatible with a pc. NOW !! finally I purchased an exquisite iMac.. and when need be, I can run architectural desktop on it in windows to get a few things done.. Apple vs PC ?No comparison.... and my iMac is so sexy it makes me smile.. so kill me."
3,It was what my computer needed,I've heard bad things about Vista so wanted a copy of the XP on hand.
2,Not bad for Microsoft,"Other than the substandard security; the endless hours you will spend trying to clean out spyware, protecting against viruses, etc.; and the fact that Microsoft has built in it's own spyware to notify them when you are connected to the internet, it's pretty good. It is a good evolution of their graphical interface and quite intuitive.If you are concerned about your ability or willingness to protect yourself against malicious attack from internet scumbags, buy a Mac. As you face the upgrade to MS Vista, you're going to need to upgrade your CPU, so you are essentially at a crossroads.Good luck!"
2,Microsoft Windows XP Home Ed. SP2,"I brought Microsoft Windows XP Home Ed.SP2, to use on my Mac BookPro as a guest O/S. The software works fine on my Mac BookPro, the only downside was as soon as it was installed I had to update the software with 98 Security updates. For the software to be new right out of the box, it took up a lot of space on my harddrive with the Security updates, and the updates on my Mac BookPro have only been 6, since the day I brought my computer, compare the difference in updates to see which software has a lot of problems."
1,Windows XP Keeps Me in Business,"One of my most popular services as a freelance technician is upgrading Windows XP to Windows 2000! Windows XP customers always have problems of some sort, so the stubborn users of XP always need my help. My network at home is exclusively Win 2000 and Linux. If you like calling in for expensive technical help all the time then get Win XP. Why doesn't Amazon allow you to award 0 stars?"
3,Its a Microsoft product,Windows is good for several things. But being flexible is NOT one of them. The issue with this product is you can't use it on all of your PC's if you have more than one. You have to buy this for each and every one of them. Its a rip-off to have to do that.
1,xp,"I bought this full version of xp because i had a lot of file damage done to my old xp so i just wanted to install this version over the top of my old version. Well i ran into problems as i read the fine print on the new xp box this operating system would only work on older systems like windows 95 or 98. Well my computer is a windows xp professional and it would not allow me to instal the new full version over my old operating system, it told me so when i tried to install the new system, so i will have to get a new harddrive and and a new op system. But the system i bought was mailed promptly, i would recommend reading the fine print carefully. Sincerely Robert Hadlock"
1,Counterfeit software!!,I was astounded to discover that the Windows OS I ordered turned out to be a counterfeit copy! Beware of ordering from Payless-Storz!
4,Microsoft Windows XP Home Version,It was everything I expected it to be. Not as flashy as the premium version but still a solid product!
2,Not up to par,"Of all the MS Windows(R) versions, this is the one I have liked best. Yet, it still gets only 2 stars? The ""bang-for-buck"" ratio is too low. MS Windows versions are too expensive for what they provide. It is time to consider the better alternative,Ubuntu 8.04 DVD."
1,Poor,"In order for me to install XP home edition I had to have internet access first. Second, I thought I ordered the professional version @ $125.00 but received the Home version. Third I had to pay $129.00 to the geek squad to load the software onto my new computer.Software obviously are not made for easy loading; in the pass you purchase addition software and it was very easy to load onto your home computer. Had I know this I would have went ahead and purchased the full verion from Best Buy, Circuit City, ie., because I didn't save a penny."
4,didn't kill my MBP : ),"I purchased this for my MacBook Pro. using bootcamp it worked fine; although the install failed the first time, but i figured since it was windows, working on the first try was too much to expect. I was going to give it only three stars because I am disappointed in just how bare bones it is right out of the box, but since it hasn't crashed my mac yet and its not Vista, i give it four stars"
3,Windows XP is frustrating,"I had Windows 98 and it worked, it was stable, it was user friendly, and I was happy with it. Unfortunately, MS decided not to support it any longer and that caused problems. Bill Gates' greed forced me to upgrade to Win XP Full Edition with SP-2.Replacing my OS was easy and it went smoothly. XP is clunkier than 98, but so far it's been fairly stable. I've gotten used to working with it's quirks, twitches and the ways it demands I work with it, but it definitely is NOT as user friendly as 98. I'm sure the lack of the 'stampede' to Vista will only hurry MS's ending it's support for this OS, thus, forcing us to buy Vista and to support their stock value."
3,"It's compatible with most software out there, but...","...people gotta get bored with Windows. Sure, a so-called ""world of software"" work on it, that's a good thing, but most spyware, adware, trojan horses, etc. are made for Windows, which makes it pretty vunerable to bugs & viruses. For example, with 3 pop-up blockers on my Internet Explorer, I still get rapid pop-ups. I check my computer rapidly for viruses, but it's still there. If you are like a businessperson, I recommend Mac or Linux, because they make Microsoft Office for Mac, and make very similar software for Linux. But for gamers, downloaders, etc., I recommend XP or Media Center.- The OS Man"
2,Incomplete order,"Vender negelected to send serial number tag with item. I contacted him and he sent a photograph of it. I was able to register and use the product, but I paid for the tag, which goes with the disc and again contacted the seller to ask him to send it. He replied that it was coming via ""snail mail"", but I never received it. Am still waiting. Could Amazon look into this? I have been a good customer. Thanks."
5,Windows XP full version,If you are like us we got fed up with the growing pains of Microsoft Vista. We decided it was high time to invest in a full version of Windows XP before they stopped selling them. It has proven to be a wise decision for us. Our son is back to playing all of his computer games on his new system without any glitches.
2,Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition,I really do not like how Microsoft has designed this operating system. I liked Windows 95 through the Windows 2000 Professional Edition but this one there is nothing I like. I have a few Microsoft computers left but I have mostly converted to Apple. The Windows XP Home Edition (not Professional Edition) especially was horrible. The only difference I dramatically see is that blue taskbar at the bottom. Also the icons look a bit more 3-D than other versions. The security on Windows totally isn't too safe as the Mac OS. My computer catches viruses all the time and when I take it to a repair shop I have never seen a Apple computer there. If you are a Microsoft fan just get the Professional Edition of XP or 2000 Professional (best OS ever!)
4,Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition FULL VERSION with SP2,Good System Software but not as user friendly as Mac OS.
1,No Response,After purchasing this item I discovered my lost version of XP Professional. I've tried 3 time to find out about the sellers return policy and 3 times NO RESPONSE!
1,OEM,"Do not order thruogh Pyrotech,it is what I feared.Misled to believe it was a Full Version XP with SP2,it is not.Overpriced OEM XP 2002 version......what a rip,I should have known better!And a rude,childish reponse to my complaint,telling me I was wrong and had no idea what I was talking about.""Sure,this is the first software I've ever bought""You even have the List price ""dramatically slashed""from 199.99 to $114.00.Since when did an OEM XP cost 199.99??Yeah that's right never!"
1,damaged goods,I received this product damaged. It had a huge scratch on the disc and would not download into my computer. I am returning it for a refund.
2,Question,"Are these reviews on the product or on the seller. I know what I want, I only want to know if the seller is reputable."
1,How does the world run on this junk?,I've been using a Mac for the last 10+ years and I had assumed that Windows had gotten better since Win 94. Boy was I wrong. It amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an OS.
3,Only watch if you are a major Larry the Cable Guy Fan!,"The overall movie is average. The storyline, picture quality, sound quality, and acting is nothing special. I do however give this movie three stars because I do think that Larry the Cable Guy is a very funny comedian. If you want to watch a movie in your man cave with the guys then this movie would be alright to get. It is for the most part a raunchy comedy and do not think most women would find this movie entertaining."
4,Worth a Razzie,"I call this worth a Razzie award, but to Larry that won't be an insult and in my eyes it is straight on target for what Larry is all about. If you're looking for ""Scent of a Woman"", well this is ""A Fish Called Wanda.""Based on that, I think that the movie delivers on its expectations. It for a rainy night at the beach with your drinking buddies when you don't have anything better to do kind of movie."
3,Witless Protection,It was just OK. I expected more from Larry - loved Health Inspector - but just liked this one.
2,All kinds of poor white trash jokes,"Satire would be lost on this guy and his writers.They probably think insulting their audienceis funny?So why are all the reviews bad or worse?Because country people may be ignorant,but most are not dumb...and everybody knows if he has nitrous oxide in his truckhe probably can read the technical manual too.Dumb people get killed, not away from the FBI."
1,"15 minutes is up, turn in your key Cable Guy.","Larry's last film was tolerable, this film is not.Not one smile did I crack. I've been known to smile at funerals, I'll have ya' know.The ""trick"" casting is inept and his jokes and gags fall as flat as a pancake.This film isn't even worthy of renting.Beware of boredom. I truly want my time and money back on this loaded production of nothingness."
1,Useless Protection,I must have been brain dead when I ordered this dvd!!Could not give it away fast enough. lol
3,Lighted Up Folks!,"After reading the other 4 reviews here, I probably wouldn't have rented this movie. However, I really liked Larry's two previous movies, especially Delta Farce, so I gave this one a quick spin around the block. Besides, any movie that the critics hate, I usually like anyway. I must say that this movie is a little more funny that Delta Farce. It is well-casted and had some great, funny moments. The humor surrounding the FBI agents was pretty good (i.e., an agents whose last name is Orange, so ""Agent Orange"") and it was great to see Yaphett Kotto after not seeing him in a movie for more than 5 years. Also, seeing Eric Roberts roam around in a jacket with the large letters ""PMS"" was pretty fair, too. I think you really need to be in a certain mood when taking in a new movie. I started watching this movie thinking it would be terrible, yet came out laughing and wanting to go immediately to the nearest video store to buy it. You just gotta have fun with this one!"
3,"[Three-and-a-half stars] The best from the (earnstwhile) 'Larry the Cable Guy' stable, yet","An excellent cast (Larry the cable guy, Yaphett Cotto,Jen McCarthy, more) seem to be having a great time inthis very non-p.c. movie with some great one-liners.'This makes as much sense as Michael Jackson at a day-care centre'. 'This sits heavy. Heavier than MichaelMoore after a 'Vegas buffet.' '...Went down faster thana bottle of vodka @ Courtney Love's house..' You get theidea. Snappy, crude and fast-paced. The best is yet tocome from Larry. Trust me, I've done over 900+ reviews!"
2,"Rent, do not buy","My husband and I have seen several of Larry the Cable Guy's comedy routines and find him funny so when we saw this for sale for $4 (yes, brand new!) at the store we thought we should give it a try. It was a shocker to see Jenny McCarthey with a very small roll but kind of glad since she did a really bad job with her hick accent and all she did was walk around in a mini skirt and cut off shirts. Anyway, the script was really bad. There were some funny moments, but for the most part there were just corny jokes constantly that didn't get a laugh out of my husband or I. Surely this movie will be left in our album to collect dust and never see the light of day again. If you are a huge fan or Larry, you may enjoy it but it has total B movie (and maybe even C) written all over it."
2,Simply Awful Acting and Pitiful Story Line. Save your money!,"Now I love a lot of his standup comedy jokes, but this guy is just an awful actor. I could not even manage a smile throughout this entire movie, much less a laugh. Worse yet, nobody in the entire movie was any good. Rent, don't buy -- it is just not worth it. I'm not even sure about a rental either. The writers should be shot. The story line is nothing short of amateurish. High school kids could have done better -- a lot better. I should have paid more attention to the other bad reviews -- my mistake."
3,Larry the Cable Guy at his best,"This movie was just all out good slap stick humor. Good old classic country Larry the Cable Guy humor. The funniest I've seen Larry since he tried fake wrestling in the hit series ""Blue Color Comedy TV"" as the wrestler Fred Flintstone. However, I can't bring myself to give this movie more then 3.5 stars because I have seen funnier movies such as Super Troopers."
1,God.,"I see a lot of movies. This is one of the worst. Let me put it at this-if you like this, much like if you're a fan of Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Bucky Larson, Jack and Jill, Meet the Spartans, etc-you are an idiot. Your brain capacity is too low to handle funny comedy, and I think that this is a seriously important issue, that there are people out there not smart enough to enjoy Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Everybody who likes this movie is an idiot, and you need to stop watching movies until you are forced to see The Godfather so many times that the definition of a great film is implanted inside your brain."
4,Witless Protection DVD crime-comedy,Good clean movie with alot of laughts. I would rate this movie a 8 as ten bring tops. G@@D Family movie. I want to see more of the cable guy in the future.
2,Git R' Done!,"If you are not familiar with Larry the Cable Guy and are expecting more than what his comedy entails, then you will be completely disappointed with this movie. Redneck / white trash jokes will only go so far, but Larry's always a good time. This like all of his movies have a loose story mostly used to showcase Larry's comedy skills, but there's not much else. A pleasent addition to this is Jenny McCartney as his waitress girlfriend in a small role. She is actually pretty funny, since she and Larry are actually a pretty funny romantic couple."
5,"Quality and tradition, Highly recomended.","I purchased this toy for my young daughter a few years ago when she was just learning to walk. She has received alot of enjoyment out of it. It is still in service with two daughters. I like to get her simple, more traditional type toys and this certainly fit the bill. It is well made, colorful, and pleasantly animated. The wheels are skewed so the snake undulates as it is pulled. No batteries, no electricity, just fun and imagination."
2,Poorer Condition Than Expected,"Arrived in poorer condition than I expected for the price. Old Library pockets, markings inside gave the book an overall poor look."
3,Not one of my favorite Tyler Perry plays,"These story lines are getting a bit old. This play didn't live up to the standards of ""Madea's family Reunion"", ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman' and "" I can do Bad all by Myself"". I didn't particularly like the comment about the ""marriage bed is undefiled"". Do we need a message in a religious play that advocates that any and everything is okay in the marriage bed? I think not."
5,Entertainment At It's Best Even Without Madea,"This play is slightly different from Mr. Perry's other plays, mainly because Madea is not in it. The great thing is that the play was still enjoyable! The relationship of Tony Grant, Cheryl Pepsii Riley and Demetria Dyan McKinney made for a very interesting, very surprising plot! I enjoyed every minute of it!P.S. If you're trying to decide whether to watch this movie based on the preview clip shown above, that clip is from the opening of the play. It does no justice to how wonderful the play actually is! Trust me, you'll enjoy it!"
3,Between Fair and Good,"It was a little boring and predictive, but it still provided a good moral to it. It could be the reason that Madea wasn't in it for the low scoring."
3,Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married,I have not really completely watched the movie but what I did see did not grab my interest. On day I will watch the whole movie and then I'll be able to fully give my own opinion.
5,Excellent movie,I love this movie. My family loves this movie as well. Tyler Perry did a great job on this movie.
4,Why did get Married,I like it alot but it wasn't quite as funny. But I love Cherl Pepsi R. any how and love her singing.
3,why did i get maried?,"It was okay, but I didn't like these actors as much as I did the movie actors."
2,CAP LEAKED ALL THROUGH SHIPPING,I have just received this product and when I open the box to to see the bottle...The cap looked like it was okay but there was the red chain lube everywhere!! I didnt even trust the rest of the lube that was at the bottom of the bottle....
5,Exotic Movie Soundtrack,"I love movie soundtracks, and I love the music of Henry Mancini. I already had the CHARADE soundtrack in my collection and wanted to add this one as well. I'm glad I did. It's great to be able to hear the music without the dialog."
4,Reiner Knizia does it again,"Reiner Knizia is considered to be a master game designer.This AMUN-RE will sustain this reputation.It comes in a gorgeous package (like a lot of Euro games), it has clean, intuitive and easy to follow rules, durable components, beautiful mapboard. Unfortunately it is not playable by six players, but by five (which is already better than so many games that only takes four players). Anyway, with passing of tiem and commitments made by my group of friends, it's getting harder and garder to put six people on the table at the same hour, so a five-player game is usually enough...The theme is also irresistible: the pyramids of Egypt! Each player is a pharaoh battling to build more pyramids than his competitors and preserve his name for eternity.In less thatn thirty minute you'll be ready to play and enjoy.A sure bet."
4,Here's the beginning of better.,A strong debut. Their follow-ups get heavier and stronger in performance and writing. They're overlooked among the better unsigned bands.
1,ZERO STARZ!,"This movie blew it. We thought the could make up in the next film, but nnnnnnooooooo! I don't want to tell you the plot because it hurts me. This film is not for kids. Killing whales, bar fights, and pranks is why 9/11 happened!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the WORST movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very drawn out, absolutely NOTHING hapens!!!!!!!! I sat thru the whole movie thinking ""Somebody blow up a car!""I can't beleve someone all that time and money making a movie that supid! Don't wast your money on this stupid movie!!!!!!!"
4,"Not as Good has the first 2,but still a great movie","I found this Free Willy the worst out of the series, not because the movie was bad,it was good but there was some parts in this movie that peaple didnt like.The little kid kinda messed up the bond between Willy and Jesse.But this was still a great movie,what an ending this movie had,Willy becomes a daddy, shocking ending to a great series."
2,They Replaced Jessie,I liked this movie but they replaced Jessie. They had This 10 year old kind of come in and try to be the hero. I mean what was so special about the first too movies is that Jessie was the only one Willy trusted and then they had this ten year old come in and all of the sudden he and Willy were special friends. They should have left it alone with that special friendship between Willy and Jessie.
1,Gruesome,"This book is merciless. We are treated to a parade of cardboard characters, stilted dialogue and dubious plotting.This book has all the charm of an IRS audit."
3,Another book for Colin Forbes fans only,"No Mercy is another one of Forbes late novels. All of his books from 2000 onwards have notoriously negative reviews on Amazon, and not without reason. The stories are silly, the dialog unbelievable and the heroes rely more on luck than on talent. Despite all their flaws, there's something that makes me come back to them. Perhaps it's the familiarity, or just that they're so undemanding, brainless, easy to read. ""No Mercy"" starts out as a murder mystery. Detective Buchanan is too busy so he asks Tweed and his team at SIS to take over the investigation. Turns out it was a good idea since the muders turn out to be connected to a terrorist threat. But the book doesn't offer any espionage. I'd give the book a weak 3 star rating. It doesn't have the big continuity errors thatThe Vorpal Bladehad but it's also not as good asThe Main Chance. I wouldn't recommend it to most people, but fans of Colin Forbes who know what to expect may want to give it a chance."
5,I'VE HAD THIS FOR THREE YEARS AND STILL JAM IT ALL THE TIME,"BEIN FROM THE SOUFWEST SIDE OF HOUSTON HAS ALOT TO DO WITH THE SUPPORT I HAVE FOR ALL OF THE S.U.C. MEMBERS, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO Z-RO AND TRAE, IT GOES ALOT FURTHER THAN LOVE FOR THE LOCALS. I OWN ALL THE GUERILLA MAAB ALBUMS, ALL OF Z-RO'S ALBUMS, AND ALL OF TRAES ALBUMS. THEY HAVE DEFINATELY PROGRESSED THROUGH THE YEARS BUT THIS IS A GLIMPSE OF TRUE HUNGER AND PAIN. WHEN THEM BOYZ WAS ACTUALLY STRUGGLIN TO GET THE FOOD ON DA TABLE. IF YALL AINT HAD A HARD LIFE..... THAN THIS IS YOUR TOUR. IF YOU HAVE, THAN ITS A WAY TO LOOK AT THE PAST OR PRESENT WHILE BOBBIN YO HEAD. HOOKS, LYRICS, CONTENT, STREET CREDIBILITY, ALL TENS. THEZE BOYS AINT THE FAKERS THE WORLD LISTENS TO. REAL RECOGNIZE REAL. DUBZ UP TO DA DEATH"
2,A headache inducing mess...,"This was easily one of the most frustrating DVDs I have come across. And of course it was not cheap either. The conducting was excellent, and the singers ranged from good (Charbonnet) to the so-so (Forbis). From an audio perspective it was a fairly representative of what we hear broadcast from major opera houses. Unfortunately we are not talking about CDs, and all I can say is that the artists' painstaking efforts were sabotaged by the bizarre video direction (and that's putting it kindly). Others have described the director's shenanigans better than I (Oh all the colors and camera jumping was enough to make one seasick). How bad was it? So bad that I could only watch it once...after shelling out big bucks! I don't mind something innovative and a fresh approach to a classic, but this was rediculous. I couldn't even tell much how the production fared. I gave it away to the book store without even asking for an exchange..."
1,Buyer Beware,"...The begining of each track starts off sounding interesting leading one to think as the track progresses the music is only going to get better, wrong. Each track is long and the music is flat which after awhile losses the attention of the listener. At best this disk is only good for backgrond music at low volume or used as a glass coaster."
3,Pom Pom is okay,"but if you get the feather attachments as well, your cat will really go crazy. I have the feline flyer attachment, as well as the pom pom. My cat won't even look at the pom pom anymore! Only wants the feather attachment."
1,Not worth your time,"Although my first review was deleted, I repeat that this book sadly misrepresents CS. The author has used a sensationalistic, attention-grabbing method to try and make people think that CS is evil. It is true it has many problems, but the only thing this author has done has applied psycho babble to ""prove"" her point. If you buy this book, I urge you to read other sources on Christian Science, both positive and negative, to gain a better understanding of this controversial religion. Regardless of your opinion or lack of opinion on Christian Science, don't just take this author's word for it. She's just way too biased to be believed."
1,Disappointing at best,"This book is book is a sad attempt at the authors misguided pension for drama spreading. It holds nothing of what is at the heart of Christian Science, but sure has a catchy title."
1,Who engages in Mind Control?,"While appropriate medical care has its place, there is very little of it being dispensed these days. Once a noble profession, the practice of medicine has become a highly marketed industry consisting of the combined forces of the pharmaceutical companies and the media. Mind control is the aim, and today's doctors are subject to these influences. ""Diseases"" are being created where none exist to promote the industry, and a deadly industry it can be.Christian Science and spiritual healing, in my opinion, are far less likely to do harm, and doing no harm was the original committment of the physician. My personal choice is to consider spiritual healing the first resort, and the medical industry as the last resort - and in that case, proceeding very cautiously."
1,Hysteria title to sell a book.,"The mind control model is not applicable to anyone except people being held in prisons that are indoctorinated by abusive guards. Courts today do not accept claims of mind control because unless one is held against their will then there is no chance of controlling a persons mind or thoughts. I have never been to a Christian Science Church or Reading Room where members are locked up in jails. My great Grandmother was a member and lived to be 95 years old, my grandmother is a member and is 93 years old, so I guess CS is not a great killer religion. While I don't agree with all the beliefs of CS, I was raised Catholic, I don't find it's belief system harmful to it's followers. More people die of accidental death in hospitals then people die of praying. So I guess if the author wants to do a new book she can do one on how HOSPITALS KILL. I used my book to start my BBQ."
1,Lazy is the word!,"I can tell you that you don't get anything out of Christian Science without individual study. Deep deep study and work. The people who are writing the ""bad religion"" books have given no indication of any personal work to understand and put into practice the theology. To sit and wait for a miracle or ""magic"" is to be disappointed. Mind control? I don't think so. Not in a teaching that makes it necessary to do your own work to progress. TV is mind control. Spiritual work is quite the opposite. Linda is off the mark in that her experiences are very superficial considering she offers no indication of individual work or deep study by the people involved."
1,"Exaggeratory, and Offensive","Let's cut to the chase. We all know that the title of this book was used simply to entice readers. The fact of the matter is, if you've ever known a Christian Scientist, they are very practical, loving people. They only wish the best for their families, and themselves. The religion is not a cult, people come and go as they wish. People are never punished for their beliefs unless they are directly putting down the church (membership can be revoked). Many Christian Scientists live by the philosophy ""God does not keep score."" They try their best to rely on healing, but Christian Scientists are NOT against going to the doctor if a condition persists. This book really tries to put C.S. in a box. Christian Scientists are like any other group of religious people. There are good ones, and there are bad ones. So why write a book full of anti-C.S. propoganda? Just to sell books."
1,Unbelievaly bias,This book plays on total sensationalism and has false information. Just because extremists take their understanding of religion and do drastic things by no means represents the whole.
3,"Three Episodes, One Tape","This tape consists of three unrelated episodes, two of which are very good. The first is, ""Going Batty,"" which reveals the amazing facts and myths about those wondrous creatures of the night. The second, ""Spins a Web,"" shows us how different spiders hunt and catch their prey and is also very good. The third, ""Inside a Haunted House,"" attempts to explain dynamics of sound on a preschool level. It's a complicated subject that was over simplified. The writers of this episode didn't seem to have a complete grasp of the subject themselves. It's an entertaining story but not as informative as the other videos."
4,"Fun, but little bit too creepy.","I got this togather with the other 4-5 Magic school bus DVD series, my 3 and 5 years old love all other DVD series to bits, but this one least. They both always hide behind me when watching this DVD. Perhaps they are still a little bit too young for it (for the creepy crawlies). Overall a good source of science and adventure stories. 3 stories in this DVD."
1,Fell apart after barely any use,I never liked this because the handle sticks up so high you can't put a lid on the pot unless you use a massive pot. I only use it once in a while but after only a few uses the legs started falling off. The thing is useless and broken after just a few months. This was a huge waste of money.
2,Piece of Junk,"This is a very poorly made steamer. It's nice that the legs are high but they bend from the base very easily, I was always needing to straighten them before putting it in the pot. Then they eventually fell off. Mine is now in the trash. (I owned it for about 4 months with moderate usage.)The tall handle is good if you only plan to use it in large pots otherwise you can't put the lid on because the handle is too high, even when retracted.I would have to unscrew the handle in order to use it in smaller pots and then try to screw it back in while trying to avoid being burned by the steam so I could take it out of the pot. I've found this to be a very frustrating steamer and I don't recommend it."
1,Flimsy,"This thing has three very lightweight legs that bent under the weight of unevenly distributed broccoli heads (seriously). When I tried to bend them back two of them just snapped off, making the whole thing useless."
3,9 inch stainless steamer basket,We have not used it that many times and already it is corroding on the bottom nut of the steamer around the main easy reach stem. That nut is NOT stainless steel. If you buy this I would recommend replacing nut with a stainless steel nut before you use it so it don't get corroded on.
4,Removeable handle is handy.,"I like the steamer, and the long handle definitely makes it more user friendly. Only negative is, the blue knob at the top bleeds off the blue color--make sure to address the problem BEFORE using it. Since it's made in China, I don't want that dye in my food!"
3,"Seems sturdy, but it's too tall!","I love the idea of this steamer--the telescoping handle that makes it easy to remove from the pan. The little knob on top stays cool, which is a nice touch. And it's well-made, not flimsy at all. But the center stem doesn't collapse fully. Even when it's pushed down as far as it will go, most of my pots' lids won't fit over it. If you steam in a small saucepan or a sauté pan you can pretty much forget using this one. I'll keep it and use my bigger pots, I guess, but at some point I'll probably grab a cheaper, more basic model and toss this one."
2,Works great until it starts falling apart after a few uses,"We purchased this steamer to steam vegetables. It worked really really well but after about 5 uses it started falling apart. The problem is with the three little legs they comeoff easily and fixing them back is difficult. So while it worked great before it broke, I will not be purchasing this item ever again."
5,Essential Broccoli Tool,"I use this to steam broccoli, and have been for 6 months or so, and will continue to do so until it gets stolen, then I will buy another one. Plus, it's kinda fun to play with. I tell people it's a satellite receiver."
3,It's okay,"Does what it's supposed to do, but I have a couple complaints...The telescopic top piece I'm not a big fan of. First of all the top part (it's blue), rubbed off all on my fingers and I had to rub paper towels on it for a while to get the blue dye off. Frankly I'm glad I realized that without it touching a nice shirt or something like that.Secondly I thought when you raised and lowered the telescopic handle that the outside ""fins"" would come up or down... which didn't. I guess it's not a big deal but there isn't much of a point to the whole top part except for maybe pulling it out of the pot the strainer is sitting in... I had to take the top off after placing it in the pot because the lid wouldn't close, even with the handle pushed all the way in.Also if you push the fins all the way up, it's rather hard to open it back up... you have to jam a finger in the crevice and pull the fins back up.It does what it needs to do but I thought it would be way better considering the reviews."
2,"A simple tool but,",Great idea for a simple tool but the center handle center broke off so it's really not useable.
1,CRAP,"The first one I got had no damage to the box, but one leg was broken off. That should have been a sign. The 2nd one came in a damaged box with the legs attached, but one was bent. When I went to gently push it straight (it's useless unless all 3 legs are straight) it snapped off. Why on earth they can't build it with a wide washer on either side of the mesh to prevent this is beyond me. Both are going back for a refund, and obviously I won't bother with a 3rd."
4,"Nice size, don't like the plastic bit on top, or the legs.","This steamer is the perfect size for my uses. The legs would be better if they were like the fold-up legs on the OXO GoodGrips steamer (which I found to be too big for my uses, but otherwise nice). As is, it feels as if they may break off. The leg length is perfect(long, the basket size is perfect, and the unit folds up compactly when not in use. The plastic bit covering the end of the post comes off when used to extend the post, and I don't see how it could be fastened anyway. I have decided to keep this, as the size is perfect and the defects are not fatal."
1,Legs All Fell Off,"I've never reviewed an item before, but feel compelled to tell you that all of the legs fell off of this steamer within 4 months of purchase. Granted, we use the steamer a few times a week, but it should last a year at the very least. Buyer beware."
1,This thing is a piece of dogsh-t.,I bought this in April and it's already destroyed. The metal flaps just started falling off piece by piece and one of the legs fell off. Horribly made.
2,leg came off,"I used this once and was pleased, but next time I went to ue it one of the legs came off! made it uselss, couldn't fix it and I had to toss it and buy another brand."
2,Good idea bad design,Legs are pressed in steel rods. Basket metal is light gauge steel so legs come out easily. Had to rebuild after legs came out.
4,Really useful,"I have to watch what I eat and steamed is always better than any other way to prepare food,I am diabetic. .I especially like the easy clean up."
2,Dumpling Steamer,"I was really thrilled to see this product but was disappointed on the construction and its quality, the pin bends really easily and the handle breaks easy. This is not worth the cost better get a wooden steamer for durability and reliability."
2,Not very happy with this product...,"The steamer legs are way too spindly and after about two months one bent and then broke off. It's also really easy to topple it because of the 3 legs, you have to balance the food right when your filling it or it will just tip over in the pot. Actually its very cheaply built, even the blue knob discolored in the dishwasher. I'll have to find another brand."
5,Awesome!,"I was initially leery of purchasing this jacket at such a low price, however it fits my husband like a glove, and looks great on him! It's a heavy jacket, perfect for winter, autumn or early fall and has a classic, simple look. He loves it, and I was thrilled to find a high quality jacket that he can wear to go out for a night on the town, to the theatre, to eat, or for something more casual. Looks good with jeans or slacks. The black suede is uniform in color and definitely solid black. High quality for low cost... I very much appreciate this seller's product."
2,"A good story, but...","I originally read all the manga volumes of Kashimashi first and enjoyed it very much. When I saw the complete DVD collection I decided to buy it. As I expected, the general plot was the same as the maga, but the story line of the anime was just as great. That is until the last episode. The ending in the manga was very dramatic yet heart warming. The anime ending was rather hackneyed and disappointing. If your interested in this title, I recommend the manga more than this anime."
4,good for what it is,"i wanted the show, i got the show. but its not the funimation release (didnt realize when purchased) and it was translated to chinese first, the names were changed, then i t was translated to english.. kind of. its pretty far off from the original text with spelling and grammatical errors, so look for the funimation release if you dont understand japanese fluently enough to watch the show. the show itself is really good though, very sweet and endearing. starts off funny and draws you into the characters, then goes into a drama with some really sweet moments. not usually a fan of the dramas, but this one tricked me at first, haha. but it is a good story and charming characters!"
4,"Fabulous, but....","Khatchaturian's music, the dancers and the choreography are sublime. I assign 4 stars because there is nothing to fault the performance. However, this video is disappointing because it is so dark. The stage backgrounds are dark as to be unimaginable. The lighting often seems to simulate deep twilight and only very partial outlines of the dancers are visible. Sometimes you can barely distinguish forms and movement. I found I got tired straining to see."
4,cute medibag for kids,"It really is a great first aid kit. I read the review about the difficulty in opening the bag. It was a little difficult to open the first time, but after I got the bag open and found the instructions on how to open it (found inside the bag) it was really easy. Comical that they put the instruction on the inside :)"
1,Not worth the money and Dangerous,"We purchased this bag based on reviews and were very disappointed. The bag that touts itself as childproof never closed once open. I emailed them and they said we must have one of the few defective latches. There is no latch it is a snap on that never snapped due to the hard plastic casing it is in. I had initially asked my husband to put together a kit from what we had, bandaids, sterile wipes, neosporin etc. he should have done that and saved our good money. Useless useless product."
3,Kind of a jumble.,"This kit is mostly bandages, there sure are a lot of them. The ointments and topical lotions are the exact same size and shape so they're very difficult to find, especially in a first-aid situation, and after the kit has been banging around the back of the car for a while. You actually have to look at each one and read if it's the burn ointment, bee sting stuff, or whatever. They should be color coordinated or at least written in big letters BURN OINTMENT or INSECT BITE on them. You can probably make your own kit with better ingredients for cheaper but for a simple kit to keep in your car for skinned knees and cut fingers it's ok."
1,Very Let Down,"We are expecting our first baby any day now, so I ordered this after seeing it offered (and receiving good reviews) on all the online baby store sites. I wish I would have known that a good portion of the ""pieces"" in the 117 piece set included some cheap stickers, and the case itself! The rest are mostly filler like cleansing wipes and band aids. You only get ONE (yes, one) of each of the useful things such as burn cream, hydrocortisone cream, and sting relief. You are better off just compiling your own first aid kid by purchasing items from the drug store. The reviews and descriptions I read made this seem like it was a must have for parents with small children. In reality, I've seen these same items in any standard first aid kit (and those had more of the useful items). One other minor thing... the product picture makes this look as if you get two separate cases. It is actually just one case."
3,Does Not Stay Closed,I like the idea of the bag its cute but after you open it about 5 or more time it does not stay closed the top keeps popping open. The stuff inside is pretty good but i wish it would stay closed.
2,Probably not worth the price,"I was aware before purchasing what items the medibag contained (it says in the product description), so I was not disappointed in that aspect; I purchased it mainly for the case anyway. Yes the case is cute and practical and can fit quite a few first aid items in it. But you would think being made out of a hard plastic that it would last a good while; that wasn't the case with the one I received. Not even a month after purchase one of the sides has already broken off and the other is coming loose. I still use it, I just can't carry it by the handles any more. I don't regret the purchase because the contents have been useful and the case is still good for storing and keeping things organized but it probably wasn't worth the $13. I wouldn't purchase again."
3,It's okay,"It does the trick I suppose, but be warned there are a lot of stickers included in the piece count. too many really. I loved (sarcasm) how the instructions on opening the box were INSIDE the box. Took me forever to figure it out (and its really quite simple). there are not enough sanitizing/antibacterial things included, I would have prefered more of those and no stickers. Along with q-tips. I won't be purchasing it again, but at least I have a nice case to refill with bandages, etc."
4,Nethino Millennium,"This CD is a nice collection of twenty Netinho songs for over an hour of enjoyable listening.Songs include: 1) Milla (live/ao vivo) 2) A Vida e Festa (w/ Banda Beijo) 3) Fim de Semana 4) Total 5) Quimica Perfeita (w/ Ivete Sangalo) 6) Capricho dos Deuses (live/ao vivo) 7) Pre Te Ter Aqui 8) Jeito Diferente 9) Beijo na Boca (live/ao vivo) 10) Gostoso Demais 11) A Vida Nao e Brincadeira 12) Voce e Linda 13) Estrela Primeira (Amor, Eu Fico) (live/ao vivo) 14.

Preciso de Voce (live/ao vivo) 17) Por Causa de Voce 18) Menina Linda 19) Ai, Que Saudade d'Oce 20) Quase de ManhaMy favorites are Gostoso Demais and Voce e Linda. I also like Menina, it sounds like a nice lullaby."
3,The Lean Manufacturing Employee Training Manual,"Good overall outline for Lean Manufacturing training but weak on detailed content. If you are not already a ""Lean"" practitioner, this book is not going to be helpful in establishing employee training course detailed content."
1,You can't tell a bookby it'd cover.,This book is a little pricy and is not really intended for the small job shop.
5,v ery practical,you can give to newborn baby as a gift or use as decoration and gift at baby shower they will truly enjoy
1,SUPER cheap,"I bought this item for less than $2 and got what I paid for. The vent clip warped on the first day and doesn't hold on to vent anymore. The adhesive was a joke. The actual holder works fine, but what good is it if it doesn't attach to anything?"
1,You get what you pay for,"Well, you get what you pay for. I carefully read any instructions they had - and then attached it to the dashboard with the sticky square on the bottom. As I was trying to put the cell phone into it - it fell off. I re-attached it pressing hard - holding it - and put the phone in. Didn't drive far before the mount and the phone fell on the floor. After the 3rd time - I threw the little holder out. It might work for someone else with a different covering on their dash -- but - not for me and I'd fiddled with it long enough."
2,Doesn't fit what it says.,"I didn't get to try to item out. It was listed under the search for Samsung Mesmerize accessories but it wouldn't open wide enough to fit the phone. Had to send 2 e-mails to get my money back. The first response was that the device was adjustable. I sent back ""Well Duh"". After that I got my money back. It may work great for any phone smaller than mine. Good luck!"
1,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this because it was the cheapest dash mount that SAID it fit my phone. Well, it does, barely. And with the case on? Not a chance. Not only that, but the sides of the holder were so large I couldn't plug my car charger in at the same time. Less than a month into having it on my dash (in the middle of Winter mind you), the mount slid off my dash (the sticky pad it came with didn't work very well). I would say I got what I paid for, but I don't think I did."
5,Still have the original vinyl lp of this!,"I bought this album from a mail order house, I was a kid and it was the late 70's, I believe. I watched all of these shows, and I loved the themes, so I bought the album I still have the album!!! Are you kidding, it's Henry Mancini! Of course I still have the album! The jacket is a little rough, but the vinyl is still in good shape, and I still listen to it. IT IS AWESOME!!! I WOULD NEVER SELL IT!!!"
2,Creating a Character Figure with Wendy Froud,"Though a very informative DVD, the production could have been much better for the cost of the product. The biggest complaint I have would have is the filming of Wendy Froud's work was done over her left shoulder, she is left handed. Basically, many details she preformed were blocked by her hand."
2,reproduo grafica da capa do lp perfeita...mas a qualidade do som,"Uma tristeza só!conseguiram lanar um cd com uma remasterizao pior do que a já existente.Me pergunto: Como conseguiram?A edio custa carissimo e comprei esperando uma melhor qualidade de som.É pior,acreditem, do que a edio brasileira.Uma pena!"
2,A little too boss nova,"This CD arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.I give it two stars because I bought it on a friend's recommendation. Elli has a beautiful voice, but the music is a little too bossa nova for me. I was expecting early jazz fusion."
1,Junk,"Received this unit DOA. Unable to charge. This item is poorly constructed, obviously. I will not be replacing it. Went with the Sony transmitter, and although it is not battery powered, a much nicer transmitter."
1,A Headache,Sandelan's music is nothing but a headache to listen too. This person is what gives new age music a bad name. It is the same melody over and over and over again for each track and it becomes aggravating and annoying to listen to. A trained monkey could play this so called music. One gets tired of listening to his cheap carnival like organ. Do not buy this trash
3,just ok,"the product i got was not exactly the one you see here. the opening was shaped a bit differently, and had a slant to it which makes getting in a bit tricky. its color was purple, but other than that i imagine its about the same. it has ribbing on the inside, which is just alright. i also have the velvet touch by the same manufacturer, and really have no reason to use this one over that. the other one is tighter, and the ribbin feels better, so i would recommend everybody get that instead."
1,Sadly disappointing,"The only Chinese words in this book are the 10 numbers. The ""Pronunciation Guide"" does not use the standard romanization (pinyin) nor does it even hint that Chinese is a multi-toned language. The text is simplistic but uninteresting--had there been a bit of Dr Seuss or Boynton rhyming it might have been more fun.The pictures are nice.I'm learning Mandarin and hoping to teach my daughter as she grows up. This book won't help."
2,not a travel charger!,"As the other reviewer said, what you get is a home charger, not the travel version (input for just 120V). I decided to keep it just because my phone is old and I don't feel like making a return.. just don't have time for things like that right now.The company ships VERY fast.But please, label your charger as a home charger, NOT as a travel charger!"
4,Very good,"This is orginal equipment and work fine like the charger that came with it that I LOST SOME WHERE. Price was right, too."
2,Not a travel charger (110V-220V),"The charger I received was the original Motorola home model that came with the phone. The charger appears to be the same one also advertised by A1 Accessories as ""Motorola AC Wall Charger"". It is not a travel charger--(110V-220V), so it is useless to me for travel. If I had needed another home charger, this would have been a good deal. Also, the shipping speed of it by this company was excellent."
3,Serves its Function,"For its price (purchased before its recent 37% price increase), this wine rack was a satisfactory purchase. What I was most disappointed with was that the rack was designed for a bottle body length of eight inches or less. Since most wine bottles are larger than eight inches, they will not snugly sit in their slot and will therefore be slightly angled from horizontal. Also, since the rack is only 11.5 inches deep, I'm hoping that stability on a carpet will not be a problem.The rack is easy to assemble. I had to use a hammer to pound in the six dowels (there is not sufficient spacing to use a rubber mallet). Finally, I noticed that there were several small scratches that showed the underlying wood."
4,Wood Wine Rack,"It arrived in excellent condition and was just as ""advertised"" if not better- easy to assemble (virtually no assembly required other than a few dowels) works just fine and is ""attractive"" in the process."
3,Good critique of economic issues,"Interesting critique of the unholy alliance of Christian churches and capitalism. Written from a mostly Catholic perspective, it does not flinch from honest criticism of the pope and Catholic teaching. Also examines mainline protestant denomination's teachings on economic issues. Would like to have seen more Scriptural support, but I did find the (somewhat cursory) exposition of the economic teachings of the Sermon on the Mount very challenging and well reasoned. Modern American Christianity (especially Fundamentalist Christianity of which I am a part) is a curious agglomeration of Biblical Christianity, jingoistic patriotism and bourgeois capitalism. This book is a reasonably good critique of the last. See Myth of a Christian Nation for an excellent examination of ""Christian patriotism."""
2,Loved the drawings but the story is a little weak.,"Put it this way, I had to reread this story to even remember what it was about and even then it was a little confusing to the child I read it to. The pictures are great, as are all her illustrations. The story is just so-so and doesn't really make much of a statement or an impression."
1,THINK AGAIN,"This toy is terrible. When in use it gives off an ear piercing ringing sound that in unbearable! I wish I could give this zero stars, but I can't. This has been ""lost"" in the garbage since the 2nd day my son had it..."
4,the missing link,"This book is easy to use and adapt to the AP Environmental Studies class and yet there is a vital element missing. Being a lab. book, one would think there would be a comprehensive materials list included. Instead, I had to flip through each experiment and create my own list of equipment & supplies needed for the experiments."
2,"Nice Experiments, but no support","This book has many good activities for the APES (AP Environmental Science) classroom as well as some for the normal ES class. BUT the caveat is there is no support for the Instructor. There are no Keys, and as every instructor knows, there is not enough hours in the day to do the work AND prep for all the labs we have to do. I only give 2 stars because of that one fact. It would be a 4 star effort to be sure (some of the questions in some of the labs are NOT obvious what the author was asking for), but A Key is needed."
4,Tales of Times SQ. by an old New Yorker,"The book was nice. It lightly covered the era, places & times. I think the expanded area about Al Goldstein was really to negative. Just my 2 Cents.But if your courious You should reed the book & More. It's only a limited partial view. Of a history & culture heard about & being lost.But very important to generations that only heard about it or might hear about it in years to come.Lenny Waller former operator Hell Fire Club NYC"
2,way too judgemental,"I found this book to a slightly entertaining view of the 42nd street that I was very much a part of in the early 80's. What I found distrubing was his overt racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and all around demeaning view of the people he writes about. He choses adjectives to describe the people that haunt the streets that really show his distaste of his subjects. I find this very unsettling coming from someone who supposedly wrote for Screw magazine, one of the first widely ""accepted"" sex newspapers. In his book every African American is reduced to panhandler or scammer, every homosexual is a predatory faggot and all the Jews are scheming to make a buck or get laid. Kinda sad."
2,"Okay, not great","This book was kind of boring, and patronizing to the people who live in Times Square. The author acts like he's disgusted with humanity. Way too cynical, and the descriptions of black people were very minstrel show."
2,My 5 year old is not that intertested,"My 5 year old is not that interested in this book. We read it a few times and he did not seem too enthused by it and has not asked for it again even though i provide it as a choice. He likes the book ""from tadpoles to frogs"" much better. I think he may be more interested in this book in another year or two."
4,Why do Leaves Change color?,It is a very educational book. I am not sure though that the age range is correct. I think It may be hard for a 4 year old to all take in. There is quite the detail about information we only learn in our later years.
5,Kristi's Book Nook,"If you and your kids are looking for a fall project, then this is the book for you. This is a very informational book about the life of a tree. It teaches children why leaves fall in the winter and why they change colors. There are various types of trees that are referenced. There are also activities listed in the back so that your kids can have actual hands on with leaves. It is important for a child to learn by touching and seeing.The illustrations are great. Each page walks your child through a visual learning process. They get to see the different types of leaves and what trees they belong to. Your kids will also learn about chlorophyll, pigment and what feeds a tree.I recommend this book. I learned alot by just reading it in preparation of this review."
3,appears sensationalized,"I have only read parts of this book, but the sections that I did read seemed somewhat sensational and dramatized. The most striking defect; there are no footnotes or references in this book, so everything must be accepted at face value. I would recommend instead, Bernard C. Ruffin's biography of Padre Pio, which seems more impartial and scholarly. Padre Pio's life is sensational enough; it does not need to be stylized like a drama to be gripping."
3,The same old stuff,"I can see young girls liking this album because of the faux-Backstreet Boys sound. I liked a few of the tracks, mostly the ones with the Indian-infused sound, but the rest of the tracks sound like poor Craig David rip-offs"
4,Nice Intro to the 'Desi Beats',"Thanks to my open mind, I've found out about Raghav via The Panaji Hit Squad on the BBC's 1xtra. Bhangra and the South Asian fusion are something only heard at Bhangra parties, the internet, and your own home in Atlanta, GA. It was a treat to hear `desi beats' mixed with R&B. And Raghav even worked with Bluey of Incognito. Overall, it's a nice CD."
2,Boy band reject?,"I really wanted to like this cd. I loved the single Can't Get Enough, but unfortunately, that's the strongest track on here. All I could think of when I listened to this cd was how much it sounded like middle of the road NSync/Backstreet Boys pop. Lyrically and musically (for the most part) this is a really weak album. The couple of songs that have an Indian feel to them are pretty cool, but overall this just wasn't worth the money. I'd hold off on buying the full length cd...just buy the single for Can't Get Enough."
4,A great mixture of east and west- plus he has a good voice,"I recieved this album as a christmas present- I think it is really really great. I particularly like how some songs start out with indian music and even words, and then Raghav starts singing with his american sounding voice. The melodies are the bomb, and I have not many complaints. There are a few tracks which wern't great, but the number of good tracks easily outweights the few bad ones."
4,"Love my coffeemaker, but there's a defect in the design here","Just to let you know, the handle on this coffee carafe doesn't unbolt (as they do on other carafes.) And at the top of the handle, where it meets the vertical part of the plastic molded unit, there is a stress point. You can get cracking and the handle will pull away from the carafe.Make sure, if this happens to you, that you carefully support it and don't pull on the handle (especially full of hot coffee.) You can superglue or epoxy the handle right back on (I dabbed Superglue onto the cracked surface by pulling the handle slightly away, then pushed it back and pressed it to bond.)The pot is as good as new. But if you bash yours over the faucet as you stupidly dash out drops of water after washing, then this will come in handy. I am very fond of this coffeemaker; it makes great coffee and I'm glad Amazon carries these carafes."
3,"Okay, but...","I purchased this product because I accidentally broke my other coffee carafe in the sink while cleaning it. It arrived on time and intact from the manufacturer so that was great. My issue is mostly with Delonghi. If I could have found another coffee pot to fit my machine, I would have. This pot has a tendency to spill if you pour it too fast. You actually have to pour your coffee super slow to avoid a mess. This happens to me a lot because I'm generally half-asleep when I make coffee in the mornings. Anyway, it isn't a deal breaker, especially since my coffee machine is amazing. I can deal with this tiny issue, no problem."
5,Delonghi coffeemaker carafe replacement,Delonghi web site did not have a replacement carafe for sale lucky for me that Amazon came through. Glass carafe was identical to the one I broke. Just had to use the old plastic top.
3,Only a portion of the original,"Rasmussen's retelling of the folk tales gets five stars - bizarre and fascinating tales - of interest in and of themselves, and of special interest to anyone who has practical interests in shamanism or indigenous spirituality.But this facsimile edition - at least the volume I received - is only about one quarter of the original book. The table of contents goes way past the page numbers where the text just ends (in the middle of a story). So the publisher gets only one star - what happened to the rest of the book? I'm grateful that at least some of them were republished at all, but disappointed that there weren't more!"
4,Important heritage to keep,"Nice booklet with Greenlandish legends as collected by Knud Rasmussen. Print, especially of the pictures, could have been better, but its OK for the price."
5,Fantastic Album!,"I heard this album for the first time today and felt like I was listening to one of those live performances that you remember for the rest of your life.This recording does not feature any of Tom's more popular songs but it doesn't matter. What it showcases is his incredible talent and ability to electrify an audience, in this case with Jools Holland and an outstanding band."
4,History made easy!,"This book is a great resource! Guests look up at least their street name, if not more. The author provides short explanations, so you can spend as much or as little time flipping through it as you want to. It provides a quick peek into the amazing history of Philadelphia, linking that information with specific streets. This would be a great tool for teachers to use, especially since seeing a street sign immediately brings back information from the book. The book has no map, and primarily sticks to the larger, most well known streets, but it is an informative and entertaining read!"
5,Excellent History on Street names,I enjoyed this book very much being a life long resident of Philadelphia - very interesting facts that I was not aware of.
4,Pop up Food Covers,"I purchased these for my wife and she really liked them. Great item for picnics. Good price and quick shipping.Thanks Amazon, Howard, WV"
4,Good but not for everyone,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I bought the book looking for backround on zen. I did get some backround on zen from the book, but more than that the book is about the relationship between zen and Christianity. This is not made clear on the cover, and it wasnt really what I had in mind. However the author covered this topic so well, and showed such insight into the relationships between all religions that I found the book very rewarding. I would recommend the book to Christians wanting to know more about zen and to anyone interested in the similarities between eastern and western thought, but not to those readers looking exclusively for insight on zen."
1,A complete disappointment!,"Do not waste your time on this book. This is Merton changing course and maturing...an important phase of an author's life does not necessarily produce anything of merit or substance....and not good in the zen sense of non-substance either...No excuses for poor writing and hackneyed philosophy! Not even Zen can save Merton here.Instead of this book, check out Merton's Chang Tzu or one of his many Christian books. I enjoyed the ""Unnameable"" as well as ""Peace in the Post-Christian Era"". With his book ""No man is an Island"" Merton is really in his element."
2,"complicated,dry not for the beginner to eastern thought","I found the book hard to follow and far too technical.For those not grounded in philosophy or theology ,it would be difficult to follow the discussions that compare the mystic insights of Eckhart to Eastern thought.The book is suited to those who already have a firm grounding in the religion to which thEy aspire and who seek to view other traditions from this viewpoint"
4,A Suitable Regency,"Delightful characters. I enjoy stronger female characters but the story is great!No one could dectate that Marquis of Dene marry against his will. But his father had decreed this would be so. Following the interview the Marquis had nearly run over Miss Clifford. Learning that Miss Clifford is without resources, family or friends, he takes her under his wing."
5,This re-release was worth the wait!,"Ever since I heard cuts from Strunz and Farrah's Americas, I was combing ever web site and record store I could find to get the CD. They finally re-released this in September, and it was well worth the wait. Both of these guitarists combine so well the music of their different cultures; flamenco, Middle Eastern and everything in between. Added into the mix is outstanding, snap-your-fingers percussion. Typically when I buy a CD, one or two cuts on it are outstanding and the remainder only fair. I can definitely say this isn't the case with Americas. All the musical cuts are different, and all are excellent. I'm hooked!"
5,No Less Than Five Stars!,"Strunz and Farah are amazing artists. This album showcases their talent, and proves that they are the best in the business. Do not hesitate to purchase Americas, or Heat of the Sun which I also have and can recommend."
2,Yes and No!!,"I love the story of Daniel and his willingness to obey God! This was purchased because it was going to be used in a musical production of Jesus Christ. The portion I want to used was defected. Some parts of the movie went totally blank or a blue screen. Some parts of the movie flickered. I requested my money back and I was satisfied that my money was returned. Maybe one day someone will remaster this VHS, and I will be purchasing it."
2,Item Fabulous but limited qualities available,"My chihuahuas LOVE this food. However, they only eat a little bit at a time so a pound roll last @ 3 days. Plus, we travel between 3 locations and I like to have food at all the places. Can't order the bigger ones because they spoil before we get to the end. The fact that I can only order 3 of the turkey rolls per month is forcing me to buy elsewhere which does not make me a happy camper. Now, a month later, I still cannot order using Amazon. Taking another star off. If you are going to offer Prime shipping on a item, you should be able to order what you need!!Product itself gets 5 stars. Amazon limiting the qualities and causing me inconvenience rates a minus 2 stars."
2,After 1.5 Years - Not Being Used,"The Maxtor unit was easy to plug into the back of my Linksys router. However, the instruction booklet was deceivingly too brief and the poor documentation was insufficient for me to correctly name the drive, set my accesses and partition. Poor support from Maxtor led me to hire an outside CompUSA tech after 2 months.Due to my house's configuration, the ideal location of router, cable modem and Maxtor unit is in the master bedroom. At night the unit has a constant ""presence"". In the summer, the cooling fan is often on.End result, this Maxtor unit is not being used and is turned off. I do use it when I update one of our 4 workstations but the transfer rate is not a fast as hoped for.Our preferred backup method is now 2 megabyte SD cards."
2,Maxtor NAS refuses to connect through Quick start,"Well, Up to this moment I have failed to connect to the unit. I can manage and access through the web interface via my D-link: DI-624 (log in) and administer the thing, quickstart finds the unit (192.168.0.50), but fail to make and access the NAS folders, (Error code A0FF-1203 ??) although I know the ip-adress and the correct name.Right now I'm afraid the unit is worthless and the support seeems totally ignorant. The supposed quick setup leaves me in confusion without any hint of what is going on- firewalls and virusprogs of course disabled. Am I the only one encountering these problems?This review will unfortunately be quite negative."
1,Junk,My client bought this drive and copied 10GB of data on to it over the course of several days. The drive then began to fail after a few more days. It drops off the network at random times and often locks up completely. The hard drive itself is probably good but the network interface is failing. The diagnostic software built into the drive won't even run properly. I've updated the firmware to no avail. The data is now stuck on the drive and we'll probably have to pay hundreds of dollars to have it recovered. Avoid this product like the plague.
5,You must get the Maxtor 200 Gb Shared Drive!,"Excellent product. We purchased the shared storage drive for our home network, and it was recognized on the network without a problem. Up time has been 100% since installation. We highly recommend the Maxtor external drive."
1,Don't buy this drive,"This drive is WAY too slow to use. I spent the time to get it up and running, no thanks to the useless manual, and had to remove it from by network after 15 minutes of use because my employees sat there forever waiting for small Word documents to open. Now for some reason I can't access the drive using the login and password I used to set it up. Avoid this product!"
1,Don't Bother,Slow to copy.... Hard to acess... Poor manual.Obviously the software developers of this product don't use it.This is not a well though out product. Don't bother.The speed of this device writing from a pc directly to it is very slow. I would not recommend it.
4,not plug and play,"After I successfully installed the drive it works as if it was connected inside my laptop. The first back up of the computer's hard drive takes a while but subsequent backups go quickly. The problem is that the install software does not get the install job done and windows control wizardry must be finish the task. Make sure your computers firewalls like XP, ZOnealarm, Norton are turned off in the install. And then make sure the IP address of the NAS is labeled as""TRUSTED"" in Zonealarm or other firewall you may have."
1,Do not purchase,"I have had this product for over a year and have had the same problems for that exact amount of time!The hard drive itself seems good but it falls off the network CONSTANTLY and just gets ""stuck"". Pushing the (then orange) button in the front does nothing to fix it. The only solution is to unplug it, plug it back in, and wait for it to be wake up and be re-discovered.I don't think in 1 year any of the 4 computers I have networked to it have backed up without human intervention. All computers have a red M circle in the task bar ""Backup Failed"" every week. A real pain... may as well hook them all up 1x/week and back-up manually since that is essentially the protocol to get it back up on the network each week.While it isn't a deal killer (like falling off the network every day) it is constantly ""crunching"" aka making noise... Don't waste your money on this unless you have time to also blow."
3,Unit is good -- software is marginal,"I now have three of these units working as network storage devices. All of these tied to Linksys wireless routers. The unit works well as a network drive. I would not use their software for anything other than disk management. The back up software, etc. is not very friendly -- I use LapLink Gold to manage backups. I have recently experienced a problem with the drive at one location where the IP address (controlled in software) has twice changed itself by one digit.... Can't tell you why or how. IT's easy to correct after the problem is understood -- just can't say why this is happening."
1,Magellan does not support their products!,Mapsend Woldwide basemap and the European basemap software products do not work with Windows XP service pack 3 (SP3). I was lucky enough to have an old computer lying around that had XP without SP3.I will never buy another Magellan product for the rest of my life. This is shameful that they don't support their own software and GPS products. There should be a down-loadable patch to fix this problem.Shame on you Magellan!!!!
2,not what I expected,"I expected a more professional appearance and for me, the emphasis on restaurant foods is not helpful."
1,Won't help you with NET carbs.,"I ordered this book to evaluate the NET carbs (total carbohydrates minus grams of fiber) in various foods. Because its title claims the book is a carbohydrate counter, and because it further claims to be ""Comprehensive and Up-to-Date,"" the ""2006 Color Edition,"" I naturally assumed it would provide either net carb or dietary fiber grams in addition to carbs. Not so much. The ONLY values provided are calories, fat and carbohydrates. That's it.[...]"
1,Useless if you're counting carbs,"I was pretty excited when I first rec'd this book, but then I noticed it provided total carb's and not net carb's. If it at least showed fiber so I could subtract it myself it would be helpful. Pretty much useless as it is."
1,CALORIE KING,VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS BOOK.....I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SET UP DIFFERENTLY...I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A STANDARD CALORIE COUNTING BOOK.
4,Helpful tool,I have used several calorie counting aids and this one works well. It is well organized and easy to use
5,2008 Calorie Fat & Carbohydrate Counter (Calorie King),"This product is very informative. It is a great tool for the person trying to keep track of calories for weight loss, as well as tracking carbs and fat. Easy reading and a great reference."
4,simple and compact.,"Exactly what I wanted, I would buy again. Would easily fit in a purse or glove box. Has lots of restaurants."
5,FANTASTIC!,"My husband was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and our nurse encouraged us to get this book to help with understanding what were acceptable ""choices"". WOW! This book is terrific, it includes information on carbs (our eating method as of a 1 month ago) and has all sorts of restaurant information as well as common and not so common foods... Anyway, I recommend this book for anyone... It's reasonably priced, so I'd get one to put in your cars and in your office and home so you can always have one handy."
4,Info at your fingertips,This book gives all the info you need in a convenient carry size. Very easy to use.
5,Best pocket guide out there!,"This book seriously has everything. It is unreal. I really like the fast food/restaurant guide in this edition, as well as the sodium/fiber/protein guides, as well as getting heatlhy tips at the beginning of the book. This is a great tool for anyone who is watching their diet!"
5,Great info!,Very colorful and easy to read. Lots of helpful information and a nice pocket guide to counting calories.
2,"CAlorie, Fat & Carbohydrate","I have found this book incredibly difficult to use. It contains a lot of information, but the way the book is set up, it is not user friendly. The information is not easy to access."
2,GET ME A MAGNIFYING GLASS,"GOOD INFORMATIONAL BOOK FOR DIETER. HOWEVER, MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF FIND THE BOOK TOO TINY. SO HARD TO READ WITH SUCH SMALL PRINT.ARRIVED GOOD CONDITION AS PROMISED.SELLER SENT IT PROMPTLY."
2,Disappointed in this book,"This is not a book you can just pick up and use. I was hoping for a calorie counter that I could open the day I got it and immediately find the items I was looking for. It doesn't work that way. Having said that, it does have a lot of information in it though it can be difficult to find. I don't hate it but I would not buy this book again."
2,Too much,I've found I'm not using it like I wanted because there's way too much information. Thought it was going to simple to look up an item - it's not.
5,Great!,"This book is a great tool!! I was surprised with how many restaurants were in it. I also like the fact that it has calories, fat AND carbs, instead of just one or the other. Definitely worth the $8!"
3,"The Calorie King's 2006 Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter","This is a good book, but I needed one that had protein count."
5,Best diet book out there,I love this little book! It is chock full of calorie counts for everyday items and fast food items. Also has carb counts which I use just as much. And it's small size is great. I got one for both me and my sister who also loved it. It's all you will ever need to keep track of calories on the go! I keep it in my car always so no excuses!
2,Disappointed,"This book had been recommended to me because it lists about any food you can imagine. I didn't like it because the protein and fiber were not listed with the calories/carbs/fat grams though...they were in different locations of the book. I would not recommend this book. If you are interested in the nutritional value of restaurant food though, it did cover about any I could think of."
5,Best Calorie/Fat Book I have found,"I have the 2000 version and I still use it all the time. It's small enought to fit into a purse or breifcase! I highly recommend this book if you're looking for a comprehensive calorie and fat gram book. The graphics are clear and easy to read. It also has a few diet and exercise tips, ways to cut sugar, etc."
3,Complicated,The book covers just about everything - almost too much. I find it time consuming to find what I'm looking for.
5,Excellent resource.,"This book is an excellent resource. It lists calories and carb counts for everything from raw foods to fast foods. My son w/ diabetes counts on it. We bought several copies (some older issues just for backup): 1 for each car, 1 for the kitchen, 1 for him to carry with him."
5,Best Calorie Reference Ever!!!,"If you are on a low calorie, low carb, or low fat diet, this is the essential reference book for you. Contains just about everything you can think of and makes it easy to keep up with your daily counts. It has unexpected things in it such as beer and alcohol, along with many restaurant and fast foods. If you can't find something in the book, try the calorieking.com web site for a searchable option."
1,Calorie Fat and Carbohydrates,"This book is very difficult to use. There are so many sections that it's hard to find any particular food item unless you're looking for a brand name - something like a fast food. Otherwise, the sections don't seem to be in any particular order, alphabetical or otherwise. I want a food reference book where I can look up items and get a calorie/carb value based on measurement (i.e. cup, tsp. oz.) Brand names are convenient if you eat out all the time, but regular no-name at-home food items need to be easily referenced as well!"
2,Disappointing to conscious consumers,"For anyone who really wants to count calories, this book is a disappointment. It is full of advice, some of which is not up-to-date with current research. Additionally, it has so many entries for eating out, fast food, etc. that the serious dieter or stay-at-home cook can hardly find the simple foods and ingredients that they may want calorie counts for. I'd send it back except the postage costs as much as the book."
4,Carbs - a love/hate relationship,"This book contains so much information (carbs, fats and calories). As a diabetic, this has been very helpful to me and I use it often. I don't use the fastfood portion (1/3 of the book), as I don't eat at fastfood establishments. However, if I did, this book would be rated a 5."
5,Calorie King,Very good reference book...Is concise and has every thing you can think of to provide the fat and carbs content. I particularly like the information on the restaurants. The Cartoons are a nice feature also.
2,great--for fast food eaters,"I was sold this book by a dietician, and that's a pretty sad thing--it suggested that if everyone in the US can count their calories using this book, then everyone in the US eats mainly fast food (and Olive Garden etc.). I buy my own ingredients and cook my own food; this book does nothing for me. My main beef is actually not so much with the book's content but with the misleading cover, the implication that fast food is what food is, and that apparently dieticians agree with that. Hey! some of us still make our own food! I need a book that lets me count that."
5,Small enough to keep handy!,"I love this book! I keep this in the car tucked between the seat and the console, so it's always handy when I'm starving and need to make a good choice at a fast food restaurant! For such a small book, it has a great list of most of the fast food places and items in my area. It's also easy to find each fast food place in the book."
3,Calories Calories everywhere,"The book is very enlightening, almost frightening if you have never looked at the nutritional value of some of the fast foods you eat. Small enough to carry everywhere, almost complete list of eateries. The only short comings are that a few national chains are not listed. Moe's, Chipotle's, and Qdoba's are not listed. I eat at all 3 often, probably not a good thing for me. Overall one of the best of this type of books on the market."
3,This book is comprehensive and basically OK,"This book is ok - the reason I say this is that I really do believe they could have come up with better rhyme and reason when putting the list together. There is no understanding to why food is listed the way it is and that makes for continually flipping, and flipping and flipping - oops I missed it - flip back, flip forward until you find what you are looking for. Why could they not just do it alphabetically arranged with restaurants at the back? I would suggest going to BN or Borders to look at different books first before deciding which one is easy to use. There is definitely a better way than this!"
4,This was helpful w/ gestational diabetes,It was a great guide for when I had gestational diabetes & had to count my carbs very closely.
3,Good reference in general..,"I bought this book since it had many fast food places listed in it which is very handy. My only ""beef"" is that there is no listing of fiber with the carbs, so you cannot separate the ""good"" and ""bad"" carbs when planning a meal."
4,Diabetic Guide,"This book is a wonderful guide to ""Carbs"", which my husband as a diabetic has to count. It also has other good facts."
4,This really helps,"If you keep track, it works great. Has tons of stuff. Everything and more than I expected"
4,I Finally get it!!!,"I'm 29 years old and was recently advised by a doctor to go on a 1200 calorie a day diet. I was given this book by their office. While the doctor also wanted to prescribe prescription appetite suppressants I didn't want to take, I used this book and their website. This book has been a God-send!! I feel like, for the first time in my life, I get it. In the first week, I lost 1.8 pounds and I didn't follow the doc's recommendation of 1200 calories, or take their stimulant meds. I tried to shoot for 1500-1800 and couldn't have done it without this book, as I eat out a few times a week. They were disappointed that I didn't lose more than the 1.8 lbs, but I was thrilled. It didn't come on 15 lbs at a time, I don't expect it to go off that fast.The book, along with their very affordable companion website are FANTASTIC!!"
3,Tkanks this product is great.....,"Great product, but like always I have not had enough time to see if all is okay . So far all isgreat....."
2,A long winded story that should have been a short essay.,"Martin Krieg's story recants his recovery from a car accident that left him temporily paralyzed. This book would have had much better appeal if it were terse. Consequently, he fills in too many voids with uneeded detail that transforms a great short story into a book that is both long winded and boring."
1,Awful,This item is old and stale. It is so hard that my dog can't even make a dent in it. On top of that this is not a 10 inch flossie. They charge $7 claiming it is a 10 inch bully stick when in fact it is a 6-8 inch bully stick which sell at the store down the street from me for $3.50 and they are not stale.What a rip off.
3,Operations but not Design,"This book has great detail about the operational use of the Mosquito. However it has very little design info. For example, there is a list of every claimed kill by a Mosquito, but no figure showing empty weight. There is much discussion about the use of Mosquitos for bomber pathfinder missions, but no comments on problems the prototype might have had."
3,Chapter Seven review,"Aviation researchers are forwarned to check official USAAF documents and records before quoting any information from Chapter Seven on the USAAF Mosquito operations. I highly recommend all bona fide aviation researchers glue together pages from this chapter to prevent dissemination of material contained within its pages, otherwise, history will be changed forever.Norman Malayney"
2,Critique on USAAF Mosquito chapter,"Aviation researchers are urgently advised to first check official USAAF documents to verify if information contained in the chapter on USAAF Mosqutio operations is correct before quoting information from this section. I recommend all bona fide aviation researchers glue together pages from this chapter to prevent dissemination of material contained within its pages, otherwise, history will be changed forever.Norman Malayney"
2,Just OK,"This album is one really fine song wrapped in the brown paper covering of the rest of the album. ""Waiting for my real life to begin"" is the greatness of Men at Work that we all knew and loved. Beyond that song, Colin Haye really needs to find a song writer..."
2,Just a list,"Perhaps I'm doing something wrong in the download, but this appears to be just a LIST of Whittier's works not the works themselves."
2,"item ok, but not as pictured","Description lists stainless steel caliper, and I received a stainless steel unit, but it is lightweight, with inked numbers, not a heavy brass one with engraved numbers as was pictured."
1,"For sure, not what I was expecting, or wanting!","Not a video I would recommend anybody to buy. The entire video is extremely difficult to follow. NO ONE on the tape speaks FLUENT English, making it impossible to even know what you're supposed to be paying attention to.I really only enjoyed about 2 minutes of the video. A breif segment in the intro shows a student demonstrating some of the more accrobatic techniques of the Art. Capoeira is known for its flips and spins. Don't count on getting much out of this video.I would assume that the Addvanced video of the series might get into some of the ""Fun to Watch"" moves. However, after viewing this video, I'd be very reluctant to buy anything else from the same creators!I highly recommend buying any other video than this one on Capoeira. With it short 30 min. play time, you feel short changed. But with its 10 min. intro, leaving 20 minutes for acctual footage (very poor footage I might add), you feel robbed."
4,Somewhere in the darkness,Jimmy Little is living in Harlem New York. With a close friend to his mom Jimmy is doing fine. One day his dad Crab shows up after 14 years.Jimmy dads wonts to take jimmy with hime to Chicago.After that things start to go wrong they both learn about each other.It is a intense story it keeps you wondering what will happen. I really liked this book be cause it takes you on a wild adventure.
4,Story: 'SITD'-Somewhere in the Darkness,"I thought this book was very good. I liked all the characters, especially Jimmy. I liked him the most because he is over-imaginative and he is the same age as me. I liked the fact that Jimmy?s father came home even though he was in jail and that Mama Jean turned out to not be his real grandmother. I also liked the way the author wrote the story.What I liked most about this story is that it went deeper and deeper into the plot. I wasn?t happy when Crab died, it made me upset. I think the relationship between Crab and Jimmy was good. I think it was amazing that Crab came into Jimmy?s life, after so many years of not being around to be his father.I might recommend this book, because it was interesting. Some parts of the story kept me interested to keep reading. I thought this story was funny but also serious. I found this story to be pretty good overall."
1,Fails on every level!,"The blind leading the blind would be a good way to summarize this by Walter Dean Myers. The blind leading the reader would be even better, for Somewhere in the Darkness seems boring and pointless. The whole book is about a endless trip.When the book finally ends it raps up too rapidly. The book begins with a young man named Jimmy Little who is an intelligent boy trying to survive a rough neighborhood. Mama Jean , his father's mother, is his sole provider. Suddenly, and rather quickly, Jimmy's father (Crab) who escaped from prison appears in the story. They embark on a trip, which is very uninteresting. There were enjoyable points in the book. The character of Mama Jean was well done. Jimmy was an OK character if not a bit ignorant. This book fails on every level. I have read many books good and bad, if you read good literature you will understand my views."
2,Somewhere in the darkness,"somewhere in the darkness tells readers a story about a boy, jimmy, who lives with mamma jean and his convicted father, Crab. Crab escapes from prison to explain to his son that he is innocent. Crab takes jimmy on a roadtrip to arkansas to proove him self innocent. crab's serious kidney problems seem to get worse as the trip goes on and in the end jimmy learns that you must have something to live for and that is a ll crab wanted."
4,portraied as action,"Walter Dean Myers is a very good Writer, I like how in all his books he writes, and shows emotion through the actions of the characters. I have also read and enjoyed Monster, also written by Walter Dean Myers. In both books, you get to know the characters by what they do, instead of reading a long boring biography about each character in the beginning of the book. I really like they style that Walter writes in. Especially how he includes all the characters throughout the book, instead of having them die out of the story in the beginning or middle. I would recommend this book or any book by Walter Dean Myers to anyone that likes to read. Somewhere in the Darkness, is about a 14 Year old boy whos dad is distant from him, and when he begins a relationship with him, his dad dies of kidney failure. this is a good example of ""You don't know what you have until it is gone."""
4,"I thought that this book was a good book, but confusing.",This book was about a 14 year old boy who hasn't ever seen his dad. His dad (Crab) has been in jail for 9 years and is very ill. He escaped from jail so he could go and see his boy Jimmy and so Jimmy would love and respect him. Jimmy has been living with his aunt.
2,It wasn't very interesting to me.,"This story is about a fifteen year old boy who lives with Mama Jean. His mother is dead and his father had been in jail for the past nine years. One day his father, Crab, escaped from jail and came to get Jimmy. He didn't tell Mama Jean that he escaped. But he took Jimmy to Chicago in hopes to prove his innocence to his son. The cops were chasing Crab and caught him in the hospital. Crab had serious kidney problems and had to stay hospitalized, but at least his son knew he didn't murder anyone."
2,Because it was boring I guess,It was about some Jimmy's dad and he escaped from jail and he went into Jimmy's house and then they went to where ever they were going.
5,The Best Book I Ever Read,This book is the best book i've read. mr. myers made the book like if it was realistic and i could actually picture the story in my head.Some parts in this book real people can actually relate to and i could. If you like books that make you feel like you're in the story you should get this book. Young adults really like this book because this book is reealy realistic for them i should know i'm one.One of the reasons this book is realistic for example when the are in the car moving to chicago like the little conversations the have when they stop for gas makes you actually picture where they are at and what all they are doing.The ending of this book i never sawe coming it was so emotional and powerful that it inspired me to keep reading walter dean myers's books why not add this to your collection.
4,Wonderful,This book was a heartbreaker I couldn't put down. So mysterious. I laughed and I cried! This was a wonderful book!
4,Somewhere in the Darkness,"Somewhere in the darkness is a great book. I had picked it up to read as a class assignment thinking it was going to be a boring story, because I hadn't seen the title or the back cover of the book telling me what it was about. But when I started reading it, I found that it wasn't such a bad book, and that it was a wonderfully written with a great theme and a great plot. I could relate to this book in many ways and I know people that could also relate to this book. It was a book that was easy to understand, and easy to picture mentally, and I'm glad I chose this book to read. I would recomend it book to anyone that wants a book with a main character they can relate to emotionally."
2,A Not-That-Good Book,"I found that Somewhere in the Darkness wasn't that interesting. Mostly the whole book happens in a car (exsept for the end). Because of Crab's kidney problems,you could never tell if he was or wasn't going to die. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone because it's not that exciting."
4,This ed. based on RC2!,"Great overview of 2000 with many technical details and ""how to's"". Another hit from Minasi (et. al.). Only complaint: Amazon didn't mention this tome is based on RC2! The ad makes it look like this is the ""real deal"" based on final MS code. Interested to know if publisher is planning a ""final"" version based on Win2k's final public release. Anyway, this version will get me started."
5,The Very Best Book/Author,"I have had the opportuniy to see Mark Minasi at many tradeshows and technical reviews. In my career as a network/system admin, I have poured though copious amounts of technical, how to manuals to still be left asking how do I do this or that. I must say Mark's writing style is a refreshing change from the standard ""We shall not insult or offend the Great and Powerful Microsoft"" technodrone we hear form other resources. You will find out what works and what doesn't! In all, I think you will find this book resourceful and practical not only in content but also Mark's staright forward, no fuss attitude. Keep up the great work Mr. Minasi."
5,Great,"This book was very comprehensive, as well as easy to read. It does a great job of illustrating Active Directory in all of it's NDS like glory! If you are pretty familiar with NT4.0 then this book is all you need."
3,"Mark, I love u but","I have been reading all of Mark's work for quite some time now, but I'm a bit disappointed with this one. This book should not have been released as early as it was. There is a LOT of information MISSING about windows 2000 here. At first after reading it, I thought it was great, and that I knew everything that there was about 2000. Then I did more research, and found that there were so many topics not covered its not funny. I think the main problem was that this book was release just as 2000 came out and not everything was known about it at the time.The change between authors was very very evident, and hard to take. During certain chapters I thought I was going to fall asleep because it was so dry which is just not Mark's style.Still with all of this hard citicism I'm giving it did have a lot of great information, and I can't wait for the third edition to come out in March!!!"
5,Best book out there!,"As a Windows 2000 trainer since the early beta days, I can honestly say that this is by far the best book on the market for general Windows 2000 Server information. Minasi has always been considered one of the best Windows NT technical writers, and this book is no exception. Well written, highly informative, and even entertaining, this book will teach you things that Microsoft never will."
2,book is Not that good,Mark Minasi jumps around different subjects to much for me. This book does not have a good flow to it and he is trying to address too many levels of NT professionals. I am a veteran mcse and you will have to chart you own course in this book. I have relegated this book for reference and not training. Microsoft just released there training manuals with labs and is much better.
3,NOT on the released version,"Heads up, folks. This book is on RC 2 and if you want a book based on the actual product, you better wait for the final code edition -- out next month sometime."
3,Average,"I agree with Saleh: this book tries to be everything to all people. Some parts are good, but some huge mistakes (sysdiff doesn't exist anymore in Windows 2000 !!). I can't believe why so many people rate this book with 5 stars. The book is written by four authors and this shows in writing style (inconsistent) and the level of difficulty. Some chapters are aimed at beginners and some at experts. It's not a bad book, but it's not nearly as good as the NT4 edition by Minasi."
2,"beginning,intermediate and Advanced ???impossible!!","I'm MCSE+I and MCDBA I's impossible to write a book for all levels. Mark has done a good job in Mastering NT 4.0 but he disappointed us by this book. if you buy this book you'll see some section for advanced readers ,some for intermediate and beginners.!! It's really diffecul to deal with this book,because you 'll skip many sections of the book regardless of your level."
3,"Not written like the linux ""Decoder Ring"" Book","I bought this book based on the straight forward approach of Mark's linux book. I advise anyone who enjoyed the linux ""Decoder Ring"" book pay close attention to its forward. Mark sites other contributors to have written large portions.I find this book very verbos. I wish there was a cliff notes version of Mastering W2k Server. If you like to read novels, stories abound in Matering W2K server book. I'll bet the information is accurate, I just don't have time for the fluff.For experience reference, I've only been in an IT position for 2 months.RegardsScott"
3,Too wordy but a good book,"Mark Minasi (the author), I have ONE advice for your book: BE MORE SUCCINCT.This book is almost 2000 pages long and it could EASILY be 1400 pages with just as much information. The author has a laid back and conversational writing style. Unfortunately, such style does not make a book thin.This book is, however, a fairly comprehensive book on Windows 2000. The author has done his research and performaned many hands-on tests on Windows 2000. He has become one of the foremost authorities on Administrating NT/Win2000 and with a good reason. It is just his books are thicker than a regular sized Webster's dictionary."
2,Nothing about Radius,"Although ths book comes back in a keword search for RADIUS, it has nearly NOTHING to say on the topic. In fact, I may well have said more about RADIUS in this paragraph than the book says. Maybe it's good for other topics, but sorry for RADIUS"
4,pass my 215 exam with this,i'd like to give this book a 5 star but some topic about RRAS make me decide to give it a 4 rating. The RRAS topic is incomplete. by the way i passed my 215 exam using this book(not alone though)
5,Unbiased opinions worth their weight in gold.,Mark doesn't tell you what Microsoft wants you to hear. He doesn't prepare you for an exam. He makes sure you know what 2000 does...and DOESN'T do. I've got 4 books on 2000 for various topics. But I always reach for this one first. It's the best I've found.
5,great book,"What a fantastic book. It's very easy to read, full of info, well organized, and full of examples. As an experienced programmer with little LAN experience, I wanted to get better understanding of how LAN is actually set up and what exactly windows 2000 offers that NT 4 doesn't. This book provided everything that I ever wanted to know about setting up a LAN. I highly recommand it to even network newbies like myself."
3,good book,"This book is very good although I think the order in which the chapters are structured are wrong,ex chapt 2 does a good job of explaining AD, then the next chapter goes into automatated 2000 proffesional installs? To use this book effectively you have to read it in your own order!"
2,Disappointed...,I bought this loader and am very disappointed with it. When I bought it I didn't realize that it didn't have an eye to stop the balls from contantly turning. It's relatively cheap but I am having to buy another cuz i hate the fact the i can't have it on and not have it making constant noise. Save your money and buy something else.
3,I don't get it...,"I bought this product a few weeks ago, and when I receive it I was totally disappointed of this loader, I have a Viewloader High Voltage marker, and even when the marker and loader are from the same brand, the loader didn't fit my marker, so know, I have to modify the loader in order to make it work. I though this was the best option for me since they were made by the same people but it seem that is not the case..."
2,Not Very Good,"I have had this hopper for almost a year now, and I've realized that this isn't the greatest hopper. This is mostly meant for beginners with electric guns. One bad things is that when it breaks a ball, it spreads it all around the hopper so I have to take it apart and clean it out. Second thing is that it's very loud. The balls are always moving and this could very easily give away your position in woods ball like it has done to me. Therefore, I turn it off while at long range which is somewhat annoying. Lastly, it is only 18 bps which is terrible for an electronic hopper, but you can expect that for the price. But the price is pretty good which is the only pro. Overall, I would rate this a 5/10. Not recommended."
5,One of the best graphic novels ever!!!,"I'd been reading comics for nearly twenty years when I first read Why I Hate Saturn back in the early 1990s. Shortly after that, I stopped reading comics because I felt I would never read anything better within the medium. It took me nearly ten years to return to comics, and to this day, I still feel Why I Hate Saturn ranks among the best the medium has to offer."
1,Skellig: for kids?,"I'm glad I read this book before giving it to my 12 year old son. I found it to be unnecessarily grim and depressing. Until the very end, Michael's life circumstances seem hopeless. In addition, I thought it a little far fetched that a young girl would think of a half dead, insect eating, somewhat grotesque man-bird as an ""extrordinary creature."" This is not a story I enjoyed, rather I endured it. Why read something like this when there are so many other wonderful books out there for kids? I did not recommend it to my son, and I wouldn't for yours."
1,Deceptive Reviews,"I bought this book for my 12 year old son, based on its glowing reviews. I'm glad I read it first, because I'm sure he would have disliked it as much as I did. The characters are flat, unengaging, and undeveloped, the plot unfocused and without tension. The author seemed intent on giving us his ""message"" while ignoring the elements of good fiction. A boring, preachy read, with little to appeal to the adult or child reader."
1,dont read this book,I thought the book was not all that great. It was kind of boring. I fell asleep a couple of times. If you want a good action book dont read this book. I'm not trying to put anyone down. I am just trying to save you time...
1,This book stinks,"From my point of view Skellig was horrible. First of all, it was so boring; I wanted to put it down after the first few pages. Also, the characters weren't normal. They were weird. Lastly, there weren't any good problems or any antagonists. That is why Skellig was a horrible book"
1,Very boring book,"This book was extremely boring. Skelling was a very strange character and I thought it was pretty nasty how he lived. What was he anyway? And what the freak was 57 and 43 or what ever that Chinese restaraunt was. This book was very confusing, slow, and boring I strongly do not reccomend this book. (Sorry if anybody is insulted but this is my opinion)"
1,WORST BOOK EVER,"This was the worst darn book I ever read. I read it last year and never want to read it again. It was about a person who turned into an owl and called chinese food ""food of the gods."" Don't make the mistake of buying or reading this book. It was terrible. I hated it. If you like dumb books, definetly buy this!!!!!!!!"
4,Book Review On Skellig,"Skellig is some kind of mysterious creature that enters the lives of Michael and Mina. As Michael and his family including his premature baby sister in intensive care, have moved home and found Skellig in their garage. Who or what he is you'll have to read the book.It is a great and tense book full of ups and downs, it appeals to everybody you are able to put it down or give any negative comments.Open to any age, sutable to anybody and comes alive as you read.Skellig."
4,Skellig by David Almond,"I thought Skellig was a very emotional book by David Almond. It tells the story of Michaels struggle to cope with the pressures in his life. Michael trys to cope when he moves house, his sister is born prematurely and he finds a strange creature in his garage called Skellig. This book is brillantly written and once you start reading it you will be hooked. The characters are very involving and you to will be sucked into Michaels struggle to cope. I would recommend this book for people aged 12-16."
3,How many changes 1 boy can go through in life,"I recommend Skellig for 10-14 years old boys and girls. If you like mysteries and like to be left hanging, this is definitely a book to read! I liked this book because of the weird things that happened. There are some things that leave you wondering. At one point in the book the old man says, ""27 and 53"" and you might think it doesn't have to do with anything, but it appears throughout the whole book. Mike's friend says to him, ""What's wrong with you?"" That leaves you hanging because by this point you're so into the book, you want to know what happened. Even though it's not one of those really important parts but it's a mystery that the author throws in to keep you wondering. But in the end you finally find the answer to all the mystery's and the problems. That was why I liked this book because at first I was confused but in the end it all came together."
4,Skellig,"Ten-Year-old Michael was looking forward to moving in to his new house. But now his baby sister is ill, his parents are frantic and Doctor Death has come to call. Michael feels helpless until he steps into the crumbling garage. Michael finds something, which he can share only with, his new and closest friend Mina. While still worried about the baby, Michael carries on and as Mina and him carry the monster from the garage, Michael's life changes forever... David Almond is a powerful writer. He has the ability to keep any reader amused in a sorrowful way that is almost reality or in a cheerful and contented way in which an adolescent teenager exploring his way through life. I suggest that any reader no matter what the background will be sucked in through the pages of this stimulating book."
4,A very cute story.,"This book was recommended to me by my sister, who is an assistant librarian. Even though I consider myself an adult advanced reader. I found this book very touching. The story was written beautifully and I was actually in tears several times throughout it, especially toward the end. A beautiful story with a happy ending, that's all I will say. Read it for yourself :)"
5,A great great book,"Skellig was a really great great book. It was about friendship and love. This was my favorite book because Michal was kind and made a friend named Mina. Skellig was a man who lived in Michal's garage,ate dead blue bottles. Dead blue bottles are dead bugs.He also ate 27 and 53. But it never tells what these numbers are,but mabey if you read this yourself you could find out.Skellig also was very weak so he couldn't move. I love this book and if you read it I hope you love it to. In the end somthing great really happens but I can't tell youy so read it.From a dedacated reader."
3,bittersweet,"Some people may find some kind of message in these books, but I've read Clay and now Skellig by this author and the quantity of religion in those books is very annoying, plus I'm an atheist. Maybe religious people will appreciate more the book, anyway there are passages in which religion is not mentioned that are entertaining."
2,"skellig, skellig, skellig sprite","i think that the book skelig is a prize winning book because it was very well writen. it makes you feel happy, sad, curios and excited. i think that the book is god no matter the age of the reader. i personaly wouldn't recomend this book to my freinds because i only really liked it towards the end. it is a very readable book whith easy to understand speech. it is a brilliantly writen book with every kind of movement and colour and greatness."
4,The Best Book,I LOVED this book it was great. When you read this book you have to keep reading I could never but it down I read half the book in about 3 hours. The begining of the book it was boring but it kept getting more interesting. The ending is kind of weird because it's just cut off and it ends. You really don't know what happens to them. I would recommend it to all my friends that like mysteries and like to figure how a story goes.
4,Don't Be Scared Away by Some of the Positive Reviews,"Not to be a wiseguy, but sometimes overly effusive, dramatic, ""life changing"" reviews can steer you away from a book, especially if it's about angels.Well, that's not a concern here. Skellig could be an angel, or a hobo; it doesn't really matter. The book is a wonderful meditation on youth, family and friendship. Written with restraint, it could be a very good introduction for a young reader to ""fine writing"". It's certainly better than most of the schlocky inspirational fiction currently on the adult best seller lists."
4,A Skellig book review,"The book of Skellig is a very heart-warming story. It has powerful and strong messages many of which have a moral behind them. It is a story of love and faith between Skellig, Michael, Mina and the baby. In a way, the baby and Skellig are linked together with strength-when Skellig regains his strength,so does the baby as though they have a special bond.In parts of the story,it is suggested that Skellig is the baby,s guardian angel.This story is extraordinarily profound which any age reader will enjoy."
5,Best fiction I have read for a long time,This story is gripping from start to finish. There are different strands of story which weave themselves together into a dilemma for a young boy and his family. I am still thinking about why Skellig was sent. Although this book is written for young adults it also stuck in the memory of this considerably older adult. Brilliant! Rush out and read it today!
4,A Children's Book For Adults,"Don't get confused by Skellig's ""Children's Book"" label. This story is deep and thought-provoking. Children can certainly read and enjoy it, but many of the subtleties might go unnoticed.The book's protagonist, Michael, is one of the most instantly sympathetic characters I've ever met in a story. David Almond tells the story gracefully, with few words, ignoring what is not relevant. The result is that the story was somewhat shorter than I'd expected it to be, but no matter. It's still excellent. Skellig, the mysterious birdlike man he befriends, and Mina, the artistic girl next door, are powerful supporting characters. The parents in the story, though minor characters, are nevertheless sympathetic and well-drawn.Definitely worth a read, especially for readers who enjoyed Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet or Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series."
5,Skellig,I thought the book was excellent i had never heard of it before and i thought it would be very boaring. I found the story both extraordinary and moving. Michael and his friend Mina are just two normal children until thay find a creature hidden beneath the cobwebs and rubble in Michael's garage. They had no idea that he would change there lives forever. The book gives atmosphere suspence and suprise and i would deffinetely recomend it to anyone who enjoys a good novel.
4,Skellig,"I think Skellig was great. It was interesting and at the same scary. It brought out all of what it was trying to say. The author really described the garage and many other things. At the same time the book was a little dull, maybe one or two chaptes. The best part was when the author explain what the Skellig looked like and what he ate. Another greatr detail was when you explained how Mina thought school was like a disgrace. The only thing that could have made it better was to have some pictures."
4,"Venture into the dark, crumbling garage. Its worth it.","Young Michael has moved into a new fixer-upper house with his family and ""stupid"" ailing baby sister. Get wrapped up in the discovery he's found in the crumbling garage and let your pallet salivate for 27 and 53, ""Food of the Gods.""I can't believe this is juvenile literature! Skellig is a wonderous novel with adventurous, smart, compassionate, and funny characters. The only qualification I can think of for being juvenile literature is that one whole chapter is two or maybe five pages long, that makes for more than a forty chapter book! Brag to your teachers :)I recommend this good read for anyone older than 6 years old because it can be quite scary."
5,Skellig by Sarah Peake,"This book was so good I bought one for a friend. I thought this book was good because it is exciting and I never new what was going to happen next and couldn't put it down. I thought Skellig as a character was quite scary at first but when I got to know him, he was nice. I found it a bit difficult to understand to start with but then it got really exciting.It was a sad ending and I was disappointed that such an excellent book had come to an end."
5,It Will Change You,"Michael has just moved into a run down new house that needs a great deal of repair. His mother just gave birth to a new baby sister - but the baby needs to stay in the hospital because it is very ill. When the baby finally does come home, the doctor who tends to the baby does not seem very positive. Aching from the turmoil in his new life, Michael quests into the garage, where he finds a creature. Is it real? Or is it his imagination? When the garage begins to crumble, Michael calls on the aide of his unique neighbor and friend Mina to save the creature. Written in a beautifully graceful and poetic style, touching on deep spirituality without ever becoming convoluted and lost, Skellig should be read by everyone. It will change you."
3,skellig,"skellig is a mysterious tale of a boys troubles who finds a strange person in his garage. His family has moved to a real D.I.Y hoause with a crumbling garage. His sister falls ill and he finds a strange man in his garage. ALL of his freinds make fun of him and his only real freind seems to be a girl who lives accross the street. This book is an extreamly good one and is worth reading, you can realy relate to the characters if you have a freind or member of your family in hospital. I would recomend this book to children above the age of 8."
3,skellig,"Skellig was a good and intresting book to read i liked some parts and didnt like other parts. my favourite part was when skellig went to see the baby in hospital. i would reccommend it to people because i think they would enjoy it. it was funny,mysterious and showed the realationship between Mina and Michael. I enjoyed the book and would read it again."
3,Skellig by David Almond,"Michael, a boy with too many worries for his age, discovers Skellig, a human, a beast, a bird and angel, sick and in need for his help. Therefore, he provides Skellig (using his clever brains) food and aspirins but makes sure that Skellig remains as a secret to his family and friends except to Mina, his strange girl-friend, a fan of William Blake. When at last, Skellig decides to leave them thanking them for their kindness, Michael finds no more worries, but Joy.Even though this book is not exactly of my taste,it is one of those books which I find unbelievable because the author¡s gender or age does not seem to influence his/her writing. I mean, is it not uncommon for someone who¡d last been a child about 4 decades ago to produce such a book which attracts all children¡s attention? And as I¡ve heard, beat Harry Potter for 1 of its prizes! Amazing, is what I¡d call this book, or rather it's author."
4,Skellig,I thought the book was ok. It was full of suspense which kept me reading. I'ts worth reading but I wouldn't waste any money buying it.
4,Don't miss it .... Skellig,"Come and join me on Michael and Mina's adventure with Skellig. I liked the book Skellig written by David Almond,it is a wonderful book. I think David Almond is a author that puts alot of mystery,and adventure into the chacters."
4,SKELLIG IS BRILLIANT!,"Skellig is a really great book to read, it's exciting and iteresting. Buying this book would be a very good idea as it's the type of book you can read again and again. The story is based on a boy named Michael who finds a man in the garage, he also makes friends with a girl named Mina who is rather extraordinary.BUY THIS BOOK !"
3,The Skellig Review,"Skellig is an unrealistic yet unique book which is also profound. It gradually describes Skellig, leaving you beguiled as to what Skellig really is. David Almond has produced a really powerful intensifying book which pulls at your heartstrings till the very end. This unforgettable,'unputdownable'book is a book worth remembering. I would recommend this book to anybody who desire to read something special."
4,Oldie but goodie!,Watching still my favorite movie! the best. Father an daughter not so together now. I was so happy to find this an a great present.
5,Car Smarts,"This updated version of her original book written to help women in general to get a better understanding of their car so they could convey needed information to their service technicians is a genuine jewel. The sense of humor and the illustrations make things easier to comprehend for everyone. As a trainer for an automotive group, I recommend this book to all new sales people. It's simply the best for people who never had to learn how a car works."
1,recycled version of previous book,"This book is virtually identical, word-for-word and illustration-for-illustration, with ""The Greaseless Guide to Car Care"" by the same author. This is not stated anywhere, which leads me to conclude I should look elsewhere for consumer advice on cars.Mary Jackson is within her rights as an author to update her book, change the title and the covers, etc., but she has a responsibility to inform her customers. She in fact withholds vital information about her product, a complaint often leveled at the auto repair industry.The irony is that I bought these books to avoid being ripped off."
3,Auto repair for dummies is better,"Car smarts is good to understand the basic principles how a car works, but it touched too less in topics such as ""How to check / repair by yourself"" and ""What tools you should buy"". I read ""auto repair for dummies"" few years ago, it did better in this sense."
3,1997 Okinawan Karae & Kobudo,I was somewhat disappointed with the film quality. It looked as if someone took a handheld 8mm in to the tounament site and the proceeding from the stands. There is no real flow to the film.The video does have some bright moments but for the most part it left me wanting more of the flavor of the tournament.I liked the concept but the filming should have been more inclusive of the events and done in a more professional format.
3,Can't get there from here,It seems Panasonic has made it impossible to upgrade to NMH batteries unless you buy a whole new outfit. It took a real study in 'logic' to work this out. All combinations lead to a new system. I refuse to be be 'faked out' so I cut the black case off of my 12 volt nickle cads with a band saw (just deep enough to slip the case off)and hooked up a set of leads with alligator clips which can connect to a 12 volt auto battery or similiar.
3,"2.5 Amp hour, NOT 3.0","I think Panasonic tools are the best. I use my drill daily and need replacement batteries every 2 - 3 years. The only problem with this product is that the one shipped was not the one shown. The one I received was a 2.5 Amp Hour, NOT a 3.0 Amp Hour as shown."
4,Get the right battery,"It would seem that the NiMh batteries don't like being stored. A friend has four of these 'N' batteries. He uses them every day at work and the older pair are now nearly four years old. He's had no problems, and they still hold their charge well.But if you want a battery for a handyman drill (for weekend use) stick with NiCads."
4,probiotics,"Good price, good quantity, good product.The only thing that wasn't good was that it arrived without any insulated packaging. This is a product that needs to be refrigerated."
5,Tight CD,This CD is tight from start to finish just get it. The beats are gangsta and the raps are tight. This ain't no hip-hop or pop BS it is west coast gangsta rap at its finest!
2,Inadequate Computer Science,"In this book, Lewis and Denenberg attempt to explain data structures and associated algorithms. They rely too heavily on obscure proofs, have few, if any worked-out examples and many ambiguously worded questions. Their assesrrtion that a ""high school"" math background is needed is clearly false. The book also suffers from poor typesetting."
5,Blue plates are truly special,"I always had these plates when I was a kid, but they kind of disappeared, breaking and such. It's nice to be able to continue the tradition. They are lovely. Very pleasant transaction. I would do business again. Thanks!"
5,Makita rules !,"I don't use this as often as a regular drill but when I need it , I'm glad I bought one. I tried a couple of those awful angle head adapters before I bought this. What a waste of time and money ! There is simply no comparison. This takes all the work out of it. You just slap a bit in its jaws and go to work. It fits just about anywhere. The gearing is about right for speed and torque. 9.6v doesn't supply a lot of power for heavy drilling but that's not what this is for. I have an 18v Milwaukee for that. For light duty fastening and drilling in tight spaces you can't buy a better tool."
1,Kim's Review,"This particular drill has been discontinued by the company selling it. They sent a different drill that they had replaced this item for, and did not inform us about it until they had already shipped it. All in all, not a very good buying experience!!"
3,98Lb weakling!!!!!,Overload trips quite easily(hence the 98lb weakling moniker). Drill better suited to drilling than driving because 800rpm speed. No clutch either!!!!!I strictly use this drill for drilling!!!!I purchased a Bosch Lith Ion PS 10 cordless screwdriver w/ racheting head for driving. I use my excellent corded Bosch 1132vsr rt angle drill for heavier drilling in tight spots the little Makita cannot handle. Makita does seem well made!!!!Had it for a few years. Purchased on clearance at Sears.
1,Customer Service lacking,I ordered this tool from Northern Tool. They sent me the wrong one and then blamed it on Amazon and wanted me to pay for their mistake. This tool is an excellent tool but Northern Tool is not compliant with its customers. This tool is no longer available but Northern Tool won't tell you this until and after they send you the wrong one and want you to pay for their mistake. Great tool lousey vendor!
1,Whale Watch Is Not As Serene As Expected,"Possibly I expected more whale serenity in this compilation, but I was disappointed with this selection. While the flutes add a somewhat peaceful tone, the drums pulled me from the calm state I was beginning to feel."
4,HARDCORE,This is realy a good intro for all people who want to get to know the dutch hardcore scene!!visit http://www.hardcoreradio.nl/ for currently hot hardcore!!
4,Brit lite,"The ""twist"" was common enough at the time, but we tend to forget that our generation didn't discover all of the ""vices."" A nice period piece. I would have liked to have had some of the relationships better explained."
3,Kind of mediocre.,"I was disappointed in this piece. I was hoping for a romantic period piece that I could watch on rainy days, but that's not what I got. It's a early rough-edged mystery, with some cringe-worth detective sluthing. It's does have a wonderful cast, with some recognizable faces who do a fairly good job."
3,The Moonstone,Enjoyable. As this was made about ten years ago it is interesting to see Greg Wise and Keely Hawes together early in their careers. Excellent British cast.
1,Bad story /Bad directing,This proves that not all period dramas are not good stories the story is poor not sure why this was made into a film. I thought this would be a great addition to my period drama library its not I was very disappointed. Basically found it very boring.
2,A lot of trouble for nothing.,"The characters in this book and production are its downfall. The young lady owner sees someone take her diamond. She has access to this person; it is someone she knows. Why not just ask this person to give the diamond back? Why not ask ""Why did you take it?"" Why condemn this person without giving him or her a chance to speak? This stupid girl (Rachel is her name) soured me on the whole book! This is not the way that people would really act in this situation. Collins asks readers to suspend disbelief too much. If Rachel had spoken up, she could have saved others, like Sargent Cuff a lot of trouble."
5,A great book!,"This is a reprint of several books from the turn of the century. It has more patterns than any of other book I have seen, especially since it is not a large book. It is not a book to learn how to tat with because patterns can be confusing because of changes in language. I reccomend it because it is a really good deal and a great source of patterns."
3,"Didn't like it, sorry.","Disappointing book, given the other reviews. Very little variety in the designs, they all seem to be subtle variations on the same theme. The projects are uninspiring and are mostly ideas for baby hats and easy trims. I had hoped for more intricate, complicated, LONG designs, but this book seems like a continuation of the whole ""mile-a-minute"" trend. Also, the illustrations look like bad photocopies. If you get this book, be prepared to be making a million 4-leaf clovers and tying them together, that's about as interesting as it gets."
4,"Scarves, purses and more",My granddaughter enjoyed working on the loom. She had a little difficulty not pulling the yarn too tight but soon got the hang of it. She was pleased with the little purse she made as her first project. It did not take long to use all of the yarn and purchase more for projects.
3,Instructions are ridiculous.,"This product is a basic wooden loom with a few rolls of yarn. My 9 year old daughter and I were excited to make something, but it was our first foray into weaving with yard (so far just potholder loops).Very disappointing instructions. One page black and white, very few words in 4 languages and pretty much useless. Even on you tube we couldn't find anything to help us.This company could have spent literally ten minutes and shot a basic you tube video that would have been an immense help. Considering the rest of this product probably cost about $3 to make and sells for $20+, it the least they could do."
2,I was initially enthralled then drastically let down.,I was excited to read the book because of his other works. I was let down and dissapointed.
1,DVD player stopped worked,DVD player stopped working a month after the warranty expired. It costs $250 to repair the DVD. I would not recommend this product.
4,Good little TV...even with analog cable,"I bought this TV to use in my bedroom. I don't have a cable box and certainly no HD in my bedroom, so I was a little wary of buying an HDTV for the bedroom. But I wanted a flat panel and a DVD combo, so there actually aren't a lot of non-HD choices. Plus, maybe I'll upgrade my bedroom technology someday. I was very pleased to see the picture is very good for analog on an HDTV. The menus are very intuitive, and the DVDs look great. Can't complain one bit. I would definitely recommend this TV...great picture, great price."
1,Frustration Maxima,"This text has simple examples that are only moderately easy to follow. The problems, on the other hand, are extremely difficult. There is no bridge between the two. The index is not particularly good. The explanations are obscure. The text spends too much time on theory that I suppose is interesting to mathematicians, but just gets in the way of learning about derivatives and integrals and their uses. I truly detest this book and find it a misery to deal with. My child's teacher was sick for the first half of the year, so I was thrust into the breach. I graduated from college magna cum laude with a Phi Beta Kappa key, I took Calculus and made an A (many years ago), I am a CPA with an MBA. My difficulties were not because I am dumb and not because I wasn't trying."
4,"Solid book, but lack of explanations","a very nice book if you are using it in a course, but not a good choice for self learning. The contents are solid but lack of explanations."
5,Solid text for high school and introductory college calculus,This book is extremely clear and concise in explaining the basic level calculus. The addded instruction on how to use calculus on a calculator is a nice touch and ensures that the book is up to date. the organization of the material is logical and the difficulty level is perfect for a teacher to teach. It is a good text.
1,"The Reason People Think Calculus Is ""Hard""","Calculus is far from difficult. It's different, but not difficult. In an attempt to be terse, this book loses all of the things essential to getting a student to understand calculus: good examples, explanations, and a logical progression of difficulty. There are many ways to explain a mathematical concept, but you're lucky if you get a single coherent one out of this book. It needs to be supplemented so much -- to the point of it being just plain useless. I'm all for lighter, briefer textbooks, but not when brevity impedes on quality. It's sufficient for getting a student to pass the AP exam, in some cases, but that's not the goal. The goal is for students to understand calculus and, more importantly, better understand mathematics as a whole."
1,The bane of my existence,"I am currently a senior in high school working my way through this book for my AB Calculus class. All I can say is that this is the crappiest textbook I've ever come across in my life, and I mean it. The concepts are presented poorly with very few examples. The examples that they do give are hard to follow and often times will not help you with the problems you will soon encounter. As life would have it, my math teacher is of no help either, which only makes things worse. If you know you will have this textbook for Calc beforehand, heed my warnings and learn from a different book if you can. Save yourself from this nightmare that will haunt you for the rest of your life."
1,Disappointed,"I trudged through this book until the end because I kept waiting for it to become the kind of story I expected from reading the back of the book... it didn't happen. I was really disappointed because I felt as though the author kept making assumptions as to how I was supposed to feel about each character. I had no feeling for the main character other than contempt because she came off as a selfish woman who had made a bad choice in deciding to marry. I felt only pity for the husband and all in all was unable to see any real motivation behind any of the characters. This is one of few books I regret taking the time to read, especially when there are so many other amazing novels out there waiting to be read."
1,Mastering Dreamweaver 3,"In a few words, the title should be ""introduction to dreamweaver 3"". It was not at all what I wanted or expected. Very, very, very basic. The companion book that came with DW3 was more informative. I have the Dreamweaver 2 Bible and now have to go back to that book to guess about how the new feature in Dw3 would work."
4,Objective Appraisal,"Having never used a Macromedia product, and working approx. one hour a day, I completed this book in three weeks. Overall, my experience was good. Following the same format as the manual, Mastering Dreamweaver 3 elucidates on every point, further allowing you to interact with each of Dreamweaver's tools and options as you work to create the site of Glendale city. But, unlike the manual, there is a linear textbook structure that motivates and provides practical applications for the use of each tool and option, thus making the learning process more substantial and meaningful in the long run. The only down side is that as the book progresses, especially in the Fireworks section, the book becomes quite terse, e.g., with slicing and tweening techniques, and I often found myself using the manual to supplement my reading. Nevertheless, I'm happy to have read and used the book, the authors performed excellently. Thank you."
4,Mastering Macromedia Dreamweaver 3,A must have for web development. An indispensable source for digging the features out of Dreamweaver 3.0. As an ex-Frontpage user this book was a godsend for the transition to a sometimes complicated program. Keep up the good work!
2,A poor buy,"I'm sorry I wasted money on this book; The Dreamweaver 2 Bible, and the Dreamweaver 3 manual are much more useful to me. The title implies most of the book is about dreamweaver; around half of it is for Fireworks. I don't like the style of the book; It gets overly long-winded on the simple stuff, and not enough detail on more complicated things."
2,Beware of 2 books for one deals...,"As one who purchases many third party books and with CDS, I have a critical eye for a book that runs between 40-50 bucks and whether or not it will be a good reference source. This book is not a good reference. I thought I would gain by having both programs in the book but actually I lost out on content on this book. The accompanying CD was not an asset for my library. About the only thing good was the Dreamweaver extensions on it. I would hold out for a better Dreamweaver book for sure."
2,Review on Mastering Dreamweaver3,"I am currently taking Dreamweaver in school and this book is not clear and concise enough and lacks necessary visual reinforcment. As a beginner, I want to understand and apply this info quickly. With so much extraneous reading, I can't get through it quick enough to get to the basic principles. D3 for Dummies or Short Order is better for the novice who wants to learn quick."
2,Where are the tutorials for Authorware 5.1 and Coursebuilder,"Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of all the books I have looked at here for Dreamweaver, is that none cover Coursebuilder. I am an Instructional Designer teaching myself these new innovative and powerful tools from Macromedia, yet I am having difficulty in finding good material for Authorware 5.1 and Coursebuilder. I suppose for my claim to fame, I should write and design my own tutorial for these two applications. Macromedia....lets work out a deal!"
1,Save your money,"Although this book claims to be for both Mac and PC platforms, it clearly was written for the PC environment. Most of the Mac approaches look as if they were added as an after thought. Did I master DreamWeaver 3.0 after reading this book?, uhh no, I didn't. Save your money."
1,Highly insulting,"I quit reading the book right after the authors state that ""Geronimo was never captured, unless he let himself be because he wanted a good meal..."" This is highly insulting to Native Americans everywhere, and completely in error. For an Apache, being held captive was absolutely the worst form of torture imaginable (see ""Once We Moved Like the Wind). Geronimo died in an 8X10 cell at Fort Sill, Oklahoma after being held prisoner for about 20 years. I was so incenced that I threw the book away."
3,Where have all the good songs gone?,"Im so frustrated that VH left out these songs:HUMANS BEING (SIMPLY THE BEST !)WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD TIMES GONE?ME WISE MAGICCANT GET THIS STUFF NO MOREICE CREAM MANDONT TELL ME WHAT LOVE CAN DOFIRE IN THE HOLE(POSSIBLY)and instead put the gay live crap on there,along with the song black and blue which i cant stand!The new songs also arent that great either"
2,Was'nt this just released a few years ago as Vol I?,"I can't believe no one has written a review criticizing the fact that these idiots released another greatest hits album with almost the same songs as Best of Vol I! Starting to look like Aerosmith. The Roth tunes on the 1st Greatest hits album are much better then these new tunes with Hagar. Eddie is gone, done. This band is over. As much as Roth's new music sucks I'd still rather hold out waiting for him to find a hot guitar player and start playing rock music. Eddie has turned into a self absorbed whack case. Michael is not even playing bass with the band he's slowly working his way into the Wabo Ritas. I gaurantee you Sammy is not back in the band. Eddie will go on another hiatus. This album and the tour was a major bomb from what I read which will be a great motivator to make new music. Yeah right!"
4,Understand this about greatest hits!!!!,"Ok, every or almost every hits package leaves off one or 2 songs we like, But in this case. NOT Enough Over Dont tell me, must have been sammy doing the tracklisting.. No humans being. Or summer nights. And what up with 3 live tracks?? they didnt thinkthis one through too good. Instead of the 3 live tracks, they could have put, so this is love, Humans being, and summer nights. and replaced not enough (song sound like a united way commerical) and put Dont tell me (which was more of a hit than not enough) IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT.. but wait until 5150 and 0u812 come out later this year remastred.."
2,Van Halen 1977-1984. R.I.P.,"The track listings on this CD are crap. Why couldn't they of released a seperate disc for the 2 worlds? Or is that they know if they had released a CD with just Van Hagar songs on it, it wouldn't of sold well? Warner Brothers should release the best of Dave Lee Roth with the best guitar tracks from the early Van Halen years through to Steve Vai and Jason Becker. Also back to the compilation, why are there too many tracks missing? whatabout more from Fair Warning like Dirty Movies? Or Sinner's Swing? etc etc. Where's Spanish Fly? I couldn't recommend buying this because its aggravating to listen to, as DLR once said 'I want my cake and I want it all, or I don't want at all'!!!"
5,THE BEST,"I don't know how I heard I about Van Halen but I knew they give me something to believe in. and they did, this album totally surprised me since it was the first rock album I ever heard. I used to be a hip hopper but Van halen's songs and solos saved me from that dumb way. THese guys really rocked my worldm and they'll do it to yours too w/ songs like It's about TIME Panama Runaround, and unchained. Every song on here is awsome."
4,"Good, but not great","Most of the hits are here. But as a completist, I was left wanting more. What happened to ""Humans Being"" (a solid Sammy effort) from the ""Twister"" Soundtrack? Or ""Me Wise Magic""? And, like other reviewers, I'm disappointed that nothing from Gary Cherone made it into the collection (though I guess it couldn't be called ""The Best of Both Worlds"" then). ""Without You"" from VH3 was a great song, and ""Fire in the Hole"" from the same (and the ""Lethal Weapon 4"" soundtrack) would have added to it. A good collection, but missing some key tracks. FOUR STARS"
1,"Bad Packaging, RIP OFF, Same old stuff nothing new, WRONG","This release is typical of Van Halen releases, they give there fans nothing new. I guess they are saving up for the box set, For $20 you figured you'd get some unreleased tracks or rare photos, maybe some good vintage live cuts. What do you get? This is the best of Van Halen but without the guitar pick and with three new LACK LUSTER songs that sound like they were written in three minutes. And Artwork thats similar to bad grade school finger painting. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE VH CATALOG STAY AWAY FROM THIS. A WASTE OF MONEY..."
5,Really The Best Of Both Worlds,"This is a great collection of songs to those unfamiliar with Van halen and even to those who have all of their albums. the remaster sound is wonderful (with the exception of (oh) pretty woman. the version on Diver Down (remastered) is a lot clearer). I would recommend this collection to all van halen fans new and old. I am, however, disappointed that Van Halen III with Gary Charone is not represented here as that was a good and very underrated album. The glitch on track 6 of disc 1 is simply they forgot to fade it out at the end. Otherwise a very good album altogether."
4,Excellent with a few flaws,"I echo what other reviewers have said here. I am no Van Halen zealot, but I do enjoy the band's music. I had a couple of discs, but I bought this one for storing lossless on my AppleTV. Like others, the live tracks seem a bit out of place, but I take no points off for inclusion of unnecessary items. But there is--for me--one glaring fault: the exclusion of ""Intruder"" from its role as predecessor to ""Oh Pretty Woman."" I mean, it is that incredible lead up to OPW that makes the song combo such a rocker. The OPW rendition is pretty good on its own, but with Intruder, it is killer. Its absence costs one star for me."
3,Missing DLR.......,"This band was so good when they came out, I cant understand what went wrong. I know DLR has an incredible ego and he an ***hole sometimes but jesus, he is the voice of this band. Hagar sucks, he should have never joined. Though some of the reviewers have said the last 3 live songs are on this CD in studio form, Panama is not on this CD in studio form. I think it was a bad idea to put those on here without Roth singing them. Hagar does them no justice. I wish they would bury the hachet with Roth and go out on tour, they would sell out EVERYWHERE. Well I like this CD but it should be more Roth material and less Hagar. oh well what are ya gonna do."
4,Classic!,"Van Halen is Rock n Roll. All of David Lee Roth's screams to Eddie Van Halen's guitar shredding this album brings back all the live shows. With exception of the newer songs that haven't grown on me yet, it is a great remastered album!"
3,Who cares it's $5.00 bucks,Who cares if Van Halen Vanhager it's $5.oo bucks full of great music so suck a nut haters. It will do until they make some new music.
3,Diehards,"Because it features 3 new Van Hagar tracks, only a diehard Van Halen fan would want this, as the songs for this ""best of"" with both David Lee Roth and Sanmy Hagar incarnations are pretty predictable for those who have (heard) all of, or most of, the studio albums. The only ones I don't own oersonally are Fair Warning and Live Right Here Right Now, both of which however I have downloaded on my hard drive. The Roth material is sexier, as for most of his stint he sticks to pretty much a party atmosphere. IMO, with Hagar they tried (successfully) to become legitimate musicians. Cynics would argue as a band they went for quantity over quality. There is a wealth of classic material that still holds the test of time today, except maybe Van Halen III. Remember, they haven't released any new material since that 1998 Gary Cherrone album. One of the greatest bands of the modern era."
3,Second Best Of Could Have Been Better...,"First of all I cant believe how much they want for this on TV and other places. I went to my local Best Buy and paid what this album is really worth. I have read many reviews on this site and agree with most of them. Die hard fans should stick with the albums they like and new fans buy BOBW's. How can they get away with the flawed ending on ""Finish what you started""?! Also the repeating three live DLR songs sung by SH should have been swapped for leftouts. VH should have saved the three new songs for their next album (more money for VH)."
2,Did We Need This?,"First of all let me start off by saying I am one of the biggest Van Halen fans on this planet. Having said that do we really need another ""Best Of"" from VH? Didn't we just see one a few years ago?The problem with this album is we have seen most of these songs before. It is a better compilation than the ""Best Of Volume I"", but not much better. As far as the new tunes go there aren't enough, and the ones here are not very good. I've read several interviews where Eddie has said he has so much good material it is scary. If that is the case he must be holding it back for future albums.The bottom line on this is if you are a new fan or don't have VH's earlier albums then get this. It is a wonderful introduction. If you have most of the earlier albums and are already a fan skip this, and wait for their next full length release. I just hope the new original material is better than this!"
3,How To Make This a TRUE VH Greatest Hits,"1. Get rid of the 3 live tracks, ""Not Enough"" and ""Dancing inthe Street.""2. Add ""Ice Cream Man,"" ""Mean Street,"" ""Little Guitars,"" ""Don'tTell Me,"" ""Cabo Wabo,"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again (live).""3. Put the songs in chronological order."
2,Why can't this be GOOD?,"Ok, I'll admit it...I bought this for the three new songs. I wish I hadn't. The new songs are lame. So, if they come out with a new album......say in 4 more years, will all the new songs suck like these do?I want to hear songs like ""Me Wise Magic"" or ""Can't Get This Stuff Anymore"". I had high hopes when Roth was (kind of) back in the band.You can feel the Eddy/Dave vibe again on these songs.Sammy and Ed are capable of good stuff. Listen to ""Amsterdam"", ""Seventh Seal"", etc.So tell me, why isn't this any good???"
3,VHy can't they get this right?,"Since VH just released a ""Greatest Hits Volume 1"" a few years ago, I assumed a Volume 2 would show up eventually. Instead we got this. Granted, this compilation brought in numerous songs that should have been in Volume 1, but it still comes up way short. Where are the great guitar shorts like Spanish Fly and 316? How about the greatest VH song of all time (IMHO) Cabo Wabo!?!? In the 3 VH concerts I have been to, no song gets the crowd going like Cabo, yet it is missing from this set. The new songs are pretty weak, and could easily be replaced by older stuff that would better complete this set. I would have preferred a Volume 2 with stuff they left off the first greatest hits, but since I love VH I picked this up anyway. Maybe they will put together a live album after this tour."
3,Sam and Dave,"Not a bad best of CD but the order of songs is strange. While the Cd does have the ""best of"" on it, I thought there would be a clear seperation between Sam and Dave. Having Sam singing some of Dave's songs already sung on the album is very odd. I think I would have been happier if they just played a 60 minute version of ""Hot for the Teacher""."
2,Best of?,"Where is Cabo Wabo or In and Out? And come on, Me Wise Magick? (I think I spelled the last title right) Anyway, this is a pathetic attempt at trying to give VH or just rock fans the ""best of both worlds"", and they miss the boat.If you are going to give a best then look at the band's essence, not the hit factor and there lies the album.Nice try Eddie, by the way Eddie... just face it Adam Jones has buried you."
2,HALEN 5 STARS CD 2,ok great songs but this albums very uneven first off whys there live tracks good tracks but why put them there instead of actual song missing hits includecabo wabomean streetslittle guitarshuman beingssummer nightsice cream manso this is loveabnd many moresome songs that were in the billboard top 100 or 40 didnt even make the list or fn faves all in all weak compilation the new songs are pretty good but not6 classic
2,Why?,"I am so sick of bands releasing greatest hits packages and remastered,how many greatest hits do you really need?How many times can they remaster and keep releasing the same material?!Five words for all bands:Get off your fat a**!Quit ripping off the fans.Putting a couple of new and might I add, mediocre songs on the package just ain't gettin' it!If you can't get into a studio and do a complete cd of fresh material then maybe it is time to hang it up."
2,Love Walks OUT,"A. Never mix NEW songs with classics. No matter the temptation to lasso a few bucks, in the end the listener will only be TOO conscious of how subpar the new songs are. I call it Karma.B. Sammy is just so much better without Van Halen and they are so much better with David it's almost painful now to watch an event such as this. But like any good freeway pile up you look through the cracks of your hands just to see if a body is hanging out of the side of one of the cars.C. Fans already have all these songs.D. Fans do not want these new songs. Have you heard Marching to Mars or 10/13? It buries this nonsense!!E. The pacing and spacing of the songs is of course ridiculous.F. How the 'F' did this get made in this fashion?G. Gee, the package looks nice.I gave it 2 stars because like any bum sitting in front of a grocery store I cannot resist the urge to throw two bits in so at least they can grab a bite to eat and maybe just maybe, sober up for once in their lives."
2,Van Halen = DLR not Mom rock...Van Hagar,Great for the Dave era stuff but Sammy in Van Halen never worked....completely changed tbe sound of the band from raunchy blues based RAWK to watered down soccer mom music....The new songs are nothing to get exited about...just buy the original 6 albums and call it a day...cause you don't need anything else but them.
1,Boycott,"Do not buy this album. Sammy Hagar has no right fronting (& ruining)what was the best rock band in the world.David Lee Roth IS Van Halen, and until he is back in his rightful place...avoid, shun & boycott anything to do with Sham Halen. Everything they have done without Dave just sucks!"
1,This time they got it WRONG!,"Don't get me wrong, I love the old Van Halen stuff, but this is just a duplication of their flaming 'best of' album. What else can it be but a rip off to the fans? As for the new 3 tracks, they are crap. I won't be buying anymore records from this band, thats for sure!"
1,Could have some more tracks on this.,"Best of both worlds misses some classic tracks in my mind:Atomic Punk, DOA, Spanish Fly, Somebody get me a doctor, Mean Street, Sinners Swing, Hang em High, 316 etc etc.I can see why people are frustrated with this record cause when you release 14 out of 17 tracks on a previous compilation, it does seem a little dia. The new tracks aren't my cup of tea, but neither were the new DLR tracks on the previous comp. Perhaps this is what VH are doing from now, releasing comps each time with a few new tracks?"
1,"Same Album, different cover.","Why? Why? Why? Are we all to forget about the Best of album now, because this is almost exactly the same. Why they don't get DLR back into the band and drop Sammy (can't sing, can't right) Hagar it beggers belief. The new tracks on the CD are trash. VH were good at the beginning, but no way are they even half as good now. I can't recommend buying this because it's literally the same album as released last time. Well apart from that joke of a record VH3."
1,"BOBW is Bad, Just Plain Bad!",No wonder Warner Brothers dumped Van Halen years ago if BOBW is all they can do. I am very sorry I bought this hunk of junk. Nothing but a Van ReHash album with 3 new singles that are a total joke. It is obvious no real thought went into making the 3 new tracks or BOBW. And why would anyone mix Van Roth and Van Hagar years tracks together. Just totally stupid!
5,Excellent compilation!,"As a classic rock fan I always really liked Van Halen, but never got around to buying the albums (Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, and my ska obsession always got in the way). When I heard that this two-disc set was coming out with a whopping 36 tracks I was very excited. I paid less than $20 at WalMart (college kids lack the luxury of finer music stores sometimes!) for 36 songs by one of the best rock bands ever. I am absolutely BLOWN AWAY by this music - but if you already own a few Van Halen albums naturally it makes sense to not get this, you'll already own half of the material. But if you're like me and don't have the cash to throw around for seven or so albums, this is a great choice. I am VERY pleased with it, the crappy editing job on the end of ""Finish What You Started"" notwithstanding (its really too bad that's cut off like it is, since I love that song). Definitely worth the $19 I paid for it!"
4,Just another collection of songs,"The new greatest hits double CD is pretty good except they left out some pretty good songs like Humans Being, Dont tell me what love can do and Amsterdam. I personally think they should have done a follow up to Best of Vol.1. But I guess if you want all the good hits, you have to buy all their cd's. Overall still a damn good greatest hits album!"
2,Ill-produced,"For most Van Halen fans, you will already have these songs in your collection in some form or other. If you are paying retail to listen to only THREE new songs, wait a couple weeks. I predict bucketloads of these showing up in the used cd stores. The production of this release was poor (see other reviews on the mixing or cutting off of songs). Also, if this is truly the"
3,Confusing...,"I used to own this a couple of years ago,but I became immediately dissatisfied with the fact that the band never kept its promise of releasing ""Best of Van Halen vol.2"". There are 36 songs here and the worst songs are the embarassing three new songs that the band recorded with Sammy.Another complaint is the essay included which has very poor photographs and uninspired writing.I believe that a band with such a loyal following owes its many fans over the years a lot more than this... What adds insult to injury is the fact that the three awful songs that introduce this compilation force the listener to press ""skip"" all the time. So,I guess, let's wait for the next Van Halen reunion of some sorts and the complimentary compilation with three new songs:""Best of the Best volume 3"". Next time, just make them the last three tracks..."
3,too much commercial Hagar not enough jazzy rockin' Roth,"Instead of so many Hagar love songs,newer live versions of early songs or any from Cherone,this compilation should have included at least 12-14 more early Roth songs.These songs have more guts and variety than any since Roth left.""I'M THE ONE""-from VH,""OUTTA LOVE AGAIN"",""SPANISH FLY"", and ""WOMEN IN LOVE""-from VH 2,""TAKE YOUR WHISKY HOME""-from WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST,""MEAN STREET"",""PUSH COMES TO SHOVE"" and ""DIRTY MOVIES""-from FAIR WARNING,""LITTLE GUITARS"",""THE FULL BUG"" and ""SECRETS""-from DIVER DOWN,""TOP JIMMY"",""DROP DEAD LEGS"", and ""HOUSE OF PAIN"" from 1984.The second half of disc two and one or two of the weaker roth songs,like the cover of (oh)Pretty Woman should have been dropped in favor of these 14 aformentioned songs."
3,"Ok, not that great","Definately a Best of Sammy Hagar with a few of the DLR hits. I don't mind that so much because I enjoy the Sammy Hagar period of VH. It's definately a different sound, but with plenty of its own merits. But if it's labeled best of both worlds, you'd think there would be a pretty equal output from both SH and DLR. The worst thing about this album is Disc 1 Track 6 ""Finish What You Started"" extremely abrutly ends; no fade out, no resolve, just boom it's over."
3,WERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD SONGS GONE.......,"THIS COLLECTION IS OKAY,I JUST THINK IT'S MISSING ALOT OF THE CLASSICS,SUCH AS ICE CREAM MAN,TOP JIMMY,GIRL GONE BAD, YOU KNOW THE CLASSICS......."
1,Roth Fans Get Ripped Off,"Even though there are some of the great songs from the Roth-Era, I cannot reccomend this collection. I can understand a balance between Roth and Hagar era songs, however the three new songs sound as though they were put together without regard for quality, and the real kicker is Sammy Hagar singing Roth-era songs live. Who wants that? I can see acknowledging the ""Right Here Right Now Live"" cd, but put Sammy singing Sammy-era songs or they could have put that cover of The Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" on it. It is a blatant attempt to erase roth's connection with the music of that era. They want us to believe that Sammy is an adequate replacement for Roth, and it isn't true. No fan of Roth Era Van Halen should buy this cd. The track list is very similar to ""Best of Vol 1"", and it includes the great Roth songs from 1986. Accept no substitutes. Van Halen is: David Lee Roth, Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and Michael Anthony!"
1,Same Crap Again,"The same thing as 'Vol.1'. Important songs are missing ('mean street', 'mine all mine'). Just one more desperate attempt to sell more van halen albums (The same case with Rush).My advice is that you should buy every VH album, except their stupid compilations, which are worthless.The one star goes to the cover of this album."
5,Get over it!,"OK, so they dumped David Lee Roth, I didn't like it either but this disc set rocks! Sammy Hagar CAN sing so the band does NOT suck just because he's in it. Van Halen brings back a lot of good memories and since I bought this set I haven't listened to anything else. Have you heard the crap on the radio these days?! I'd much rather listen to VH than that junk!"
3,Van Halen sucks,"Where are...(Dont Tell Me) What LoveCan Do, Where Have All the Good Times Gone, Humans Being, Ice Cream Man, Amsterdam (surprised more reviewers did'nt mention this track), Feelin', Without You(even though it's with Gary Cherone, still a great song),Mean Street, So This Is Love, and Me Wise Magic or Can't Get This Stuff No More (which were supposedly hits on the first ""Best of"" compilation). My opinion...leave out the 3 new so called ""hits"" and leave out the 3 live tracks, make it a 3 cd set, add all the songs I mentioned and make it a TRUE best of compilation.I also do not understand why so many bands include new tracks on best of compilations. Release them separately."
2,Another cheap marketing ploy bites the dust...,"Ok, let me make one thing clear: I do not own this CD. However, one thing that is obvious from the description is that about 80% of the tunes from this ""latest"" GH collection are the same as on the original GH collection. Now, if I'm expected to buy this CD for the sole purpose of getting three new (and mediocre) Haggar tunes, well, I'm sorry but the marketing wiz at Rhino Records is gonna have to come up with something a lot better than that. I would have rather waited a couple of more years to get a complete new studio album from Eddie and the boys. Hope you're proud - another cheap marketing ploy bites the dust!"
2,glam metal,try not to hurt your necks head banging to this!R.I.P. all glam metalgave it an extra star for eddies talent
3,The new tracks are nothing special.,I can't review the old stuff on this because it is classic! But the 3 new tracks are nothing special to me.
2,Another CRAP Van Halen Compilation.,"Whay don't they release the best of Era 1 and the best of Era 2 for f**ks sake? It's obvious that many fans are only buying this to listen to the old Era. The new tracks suck, they aren't even worth a star. Your probably better off downloading the best MP3s and then burning them onto CD."
3,van halen trapped and frozen,Van Halen reminds me of guns n roses... a great band that walked away and wasted it's talent for decades. The songs here seem so dated and old. The best work they ever released was FAIR WARINING and it is only represented by one track here. FAIR WARNING was the closest the boys ever got to being a band... the rest is just party music... like and 80's pop metal Beach Boys. David Lee Roth is the only thing that stood out... and nothing much has changed over they years. A good collection but it shows the limits of the band.
4,really good overview,"when I think about Van Halen I just feel that more should be going on&Happening. they should be seen as a Great Band,but through some suspect choices they have kinda slipped through the cracks but this double Disc reminds you of there Musical Importance.Eddi'e Fret Board Work,Alex on Drums,Michael anthony on Bass.Diamond Dave&Sammy on Vocals."
2,Dave Lee Roth IS Van Halen,"Sammy as a single artist is crap. Apart from DLR performing with some of the best guitarists in the world like me, I must admit he IS Van Halen! Sammy Hagar is boring. His voice is boring, his lyrics are boring and non inventive, how many time does he have to sing 'stormy weather' for f***s sake? The music changed into poppy dull crap when Roth left because we had to tune up one step We shouldn't of taken on a singer who's career was just about past it's sell by date. Dave Lee Roth should be put back in this band as soon as possible, I'm gonna talk to Alex about it. Only nerds can be into Hagar. Hagar should retire, something that he should of done 20 years ago. Yer, lets get ROTH Back!!!"
1,David Lee Roth IS Van Halen,"David Lee Roth IS Van Halen. All you need to do to prove that is listen to classic Van Halen and compare it to Dave's solo stuff and then to Van Hagar. It will be obvious then that Dave is the heart and soul of this band.The title of this should be ""Some Good Songs From A Great World And Some Garbage From Another World"". Sammy Hagar destroyed this band (or perhaps Eddie Van Halen destroyed it by letting Sammy Hagar into it). Van Hagar is nothing more than a second rate version of Journey.The fact that live versions of classic Van Halen songs are on here sung by Sammy Hagar is all you need to know to prove the sorry state of this band (and Eddie Van Halen's mind).To sum it up. Don't buy this garbage. Go buy a David Lee Roth solo CD like DLR Band, Skyscraper, or Diamond Dave."
2,VAN-HALEN ( grow -up ),"CRAPPY HITS CD. I got so fed up with this band, and it's lazy band members.......OH YES, and there never released VOL. 2 hits collection and the 2 disk greatest hits "" CRAP "" ( LISTED HERE )............ that I just gave up on these loonies and throwed out every album they had in my collection. This Album of hits BITES. No -one but higher up powers can fix this Washed -up band and there mental games with there fans ( as well as there rude behavior to there buyers ). How about some - more JUNK HITS ALBUM VAN-HALEN. ""You guys are funny aren't you ? "" HAHAHAHA"
4,A good return,"If you are a Van Halen purist, you don't like it. If you're not, it's a great album. Sammy adds a new dimension to the band: group effort (not a collection of solo efforts). Sammy fans will be pleased as well."
3,Haphazard track order spoils album,"The order of the tracks completely ruins this album for me. It should be arranged in roughly chronological order or at least separated by lead singer. The three new tracks are not very good and this is made worse by placing them as tracks 2-4. The selection of songs is not so bad otherwise, although the live versions with Hagar performing a few of Roth's hits are a largely a throw-away as far as I'm concerned.I only bought this version because of the fact that it includes everything on Best of Van Halen, Vol. 1. I intend to separate the tracks myself and burn one CD for Sammy Hagar and one for David Lee Roth. The original CDs will sit unused on the shelf."
3,Bad Mastering / Errors With Single Versions,"Check the inside of your inserts closely because many of the songs are supposed to be presented in their single versions but none are, such as ""Right Now."" I hate it when that happens because a lot of times, single versions can only be found on greatest hits cds. That is a bad selling point for me, but for the casual fan, the collection has a good mix on it."
1,"Can complain, this album is crap.","So these 3 tracks are the results of an 11 year split then? Timeless hours writing and recording in the 5150 studio? Well all I can say is that VH have lost it now TOTALLY! You would have thought that after the agony Eddie has been through over the past few years the music would reflect more emotion, but no it's dead, pure Van Hagar fashion. These tracks are crap, I have played them once and that's the last time I ever bother listening to em. So if this is an introduction to their next album, then `Fair Warning' cause I certainly won't be buying it. R.I.P Van Halen, a long time ago you use to be a cool band, but now you suck suck suck!"
3,ROTH AND ROLL,"Okay I am going to lay the cards fairly square on the table I don't see the Roth era band and the recently re patched Hagar era as one and the same band in any form or fashion. I wish they had different names. How can they be described as the same? From the punky vocals and sheer teenage rebellion of the Roth era with the jaw dropping goose bump producing guitar work compared to the tired non emotive Hagar synth overwashed drudgery since 5150. All this collection makes me think to do is to go out and buy everyting from 1984 back. Avoid and wait for the real gang buster tour that everyone deserves and a new album featuring the better line up. Alternatively you could buy this collection like I did and keep pressing the next button whilst driving the car hoping you hit the ""better"" songs."
4,This really is the best of both worlds,"Even for you pure DLR Van Halen fans, this CD is great, Sammy doesn't stretch too far into Roth territory. I hated Van Haggar at first but these are the songs which helped me with the transition. This is a good collection."
3,Van Halen / Van Hagar,"ok Ok I bought this album because I am a huge fan of the early Van Halen Stuff. I loved Sammy as a solo act but just don't buy him as a part of ""Van Halen"". The Song selection overall is pretty good. I didn't care for any of the new songs. It just amazes me that David Lee Roth gets so little credit on the album. You would have thought since it represents both era's that a picture of Dave with the band would appear somewhere??? Also my problem with the live tracks are that sammy is singing them. Couldn't they at least put dave on one of them since all three songs are from his part of his reign as frontman supreme! well I have said my piece."
5,This time they got it right! Excellent album!,"I thought that this Van Halen album was smartly compiled and done. Though not in chronological order, they blended the songs to how they sound back to back. I have played this on and off the past 5 weeks since I bought it (the day it was released on July 20, 2004 at a Wal-Mart) while on vacation in Amarillo, Texas during a road trip out west. The 1978-1983 songs with Roth balance well with the '80s/'90s hits by Sammy Hagar. The live songs fit well with this album. I still love Panama and its crunchy, fast, big over the top sound! I liked the three new songs that followed Eruption. And I like that Mike Shipley got to record with VH on the mixing part--he's one of my favorites! so Most purists would not agree with this decision, but they're Van Halen and they do what they want! Fine, rocking collection--get 10, 20, maybe 30 copies of it to send to your friends and comrades!!!!!!"
3,A bit disappointing,I like the feel of the lipstick but the color leaves a bit to be desired. It's so dang expensive that I feel like I gotta use the whole thing before buying another color.
5,"Wonderful color, Great smell!","This is a great lipstick. I love the smell and it has a very natural color to it. I normally wear ""pink's"", but this color works for me. I would highly recommend it!"
1,warning to music lovers,"Twiggy's vocal performance on this soundtrack has to be one of the worst and most embarrassing in the history of musical theatre.Non singing actors who sing musicals are fine, especially if like Rex harrison they take it to a completly different level by cleverly acknowlesdging what they are doing. However, non actresses who can't sing, performing songs that require someone with a voice like Gertrude Lawrence is something else. Did this show really run on Broadway? Did Americans, used to the highest standards of musical theatre really pay to see it? She has no range, she is way too nasal, she is at times out of tune. On some tracks her cockney vibrato make her sound like Spike Milligan in 'The Goons'. Do yourself a big favour, seek out the original Coward recordings with Gertrude Lawrence and buy those. I wonder if The Master has stopoped spinning in his grave yet."
4,Extended Mix Heaven,"Those that are looking only for the songs they heard on the radio are better off looking at one of the greatest hit compilations, but for those of us who enjoy the sheer heart-pumpin' attitude of Billy's best and want more of it will certainly want this one. Some songs - such as Flesh for Fantasy - are drastically remixed and contain even more attitude (if that's possible), while others - like White Wedding, Part 2 - simply give you more of a good thing.If you enjoy extended mixes, the unbridaled punk attitude of Billy Idol in the 80s, and a leg-thumping good time that'll make you wanna get up off yer rump and dance then this is the one to buy!"
3,incomplete,this cd isn't complete without cradle of love and rebel yell other than that it's a great cd.
5,Don't Mess With Success... Unless You're This CD,"The best collection of remixes I've ever had. Of course I'm a Billy Idol fan, and I know remixes can sometimes be pathetic but this CD is full of great ones. Billy Idol has energy but these remixes seem to find a way to shoot these songs with 100ccs of adrenaline. Great for Idol veterans and new-comers."
2,A punk-pop dance oddity...,"I can't say that this release, despite it's popularity is one to be taken too seriously. While it's sometimes slick remixes and extended versions of old tracks make for an interesting listen, they bring little new out in these classic songs to make anyone hooked for more than a moment. By dance standards, these songs aren't as hot as one might think and by rock and roll standards they come across as watered down in this setting.If you're a huge Billy Idol fan I'd get this...but it's not the casual listener."
2,Get a Clue!,"Vital Idol really misses the target by not having Rebel Yell. What an embarrassing oversight! Doesn't any record company have the good sense to pull together a REAL collection of his greatest hits? You know, one that includes: Rebel Yell, Cradle of Love, Dancing with Myself, To be a Lover,...."
5,"VITAL IDOL, BILLY IDOL CD",I am a huge Billy Idol fan and this is one of his very best colections of songs. Must have for all of his fans.
3,"Billy ""Mony Mony"" Idol","I love Billy's music from the 80s! Rebel Yell, my all time favorite Billy song is not on this cd:( Also Billy had a huge hit with ""Mony Mony(live)"". The version on the CD is not the live version that was such a huge hit back in 1987. So each one of those cost him a star. Other than that keep on rockin Billy!"
3,TO CORREST THE FALSE,"THIS CD IS COMMONLY REFERED TO AS THE CD WITH BILLY'S #1 SMASH HIT VERSION OF MONY MONY. THIS IS FALSE, THE IT VERSION WAS A LIVE VERSION NOT FOUND ON THIS CD BUT ON 11 BEST OR THE ESSENTIAL"
3,cool for the 80's,i used to really dig Billy Idol around the rebel yell era but he fell off for me.this set is alright but where is eyes without a face&rebel yell? and the clubs have played mony mony to death.this disc is alright.but those two cuts would have been a four.Steve Stevens was cool.
4,Nice & Big,"I just traded in my old reliable canvas bag for this one. It was hard to do (I love the canvas) but the extra interior space saves me a lot of trips to the truck. My only complaint is that some of the exterior pockets are pretty small. Many of them are too ""tight"" to use for much. All in all, a really good bag with lots of room."
4,Bucket Boss GateMouth bag,Handy item for service calls when you know what your going to need and do not wish to take it all. This bag is sturdy and seems to have a place for everything.
4,great buy,I gave this item 4 stars because after about three weeks I broke a clip that holds the big strap. I did a lot of browsing for the right bag and this is it. Its big and tough Ive carried a lot of weight in it about 40 lbs or more and am still very happy with it.
5,Bucket Boss Brand 06067 Pro Super GateMouth,"Excellent, I purchased to hold emergency items in my suv and it is wonderful. Great size and holds everything I need for emergencies."
4,Good Exercises for Relaxation,"I am a practicing counselor, and I purchased this set for use in the therapy that I do. I thought it was reasonably priced, and the CD's and cards give several different examples of breathing and meditation exercises. Basically, for your money you're getting a few dozen flash cards with suggested exercises, an instructional booklet, and two CD's. It's nothing earth-shattering and comes across as a little New Agey, but the exercises are good. I know from the research literature I've read and from my own clinical experience that these exercises are helpful. I particularly like the different ways to breathe. If you're looking to reach enlightenment or higher states of existence, keep looking. But if you're looking to reduce your stress, stop smoking, sleep better, become less tense, supplement an exercise or diet program, or just relax a bit, then I'd recommend this box set."
4,Dr. Andrew Weil's Mind-Body Toolkit,"The guided imagery CD was extremely helpful (even more so than the breathing disc). I learned how to relax fully, which relieved the stress of a cancer diagnosis. It helped me to get back to sleep during restless nights. The music following the guided imagery is also excellent."
4,Easy to follow,I ordered this on the recommendation of my doctor to help ease stress. After reading the book and listening to the CD's the exercises and other methods Dr Weil suggests are easy to follow. Only advice is the music and certain parts are very relaxing so definitely don't plan to do some of the areas of toolkit during working hours save them for home.
4,Not what I expected,"I've been a fan of Dr. Weil's written material and website. I was looking for something to listen to while resting or trying to rest. I found this was too intense. I'm keeping it, as I move forward I believe this will be a good fit. In the meantime, I really enjoy the sound wave tracks."
4,LIKE IT SO FAR,I HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY SINCE I RECEAVED THIS PRODUCT. SO I HAVE NOT MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROGRAM YET. BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS OK THE INFORMATION IS SET UP PERFECTLY TO BE LEARNED ATYOUR OWN PASS. I TRUELY LOOK FORWARD TO FINISHIING ALL THE INFORMATION. I HAVE GREAT FAITH THAT IT WILL CHANGE MY LIFE.CAROLYN
5,Great deal,Lights were to match existing lights on a porch. They came in a factory sealed box and were a perfect match. Quick delivery. Great price.
4,Threatening enough to trigger a book burning,"An historical sidelight on this book (which is a must read on the short list of the women's ordination topic):the book was originally published by a ""Catholic"" publishing house owned by an order of Catholic monks. When the topic became a no-no for discussion according to the Vatican, the monks destroyed their 1300 remaining copies. The method of destruction however may (deniably, of course) have been a subtle answer to the Vatican clamp down on discussion. The monks burned the books in their furnace system, generating thereby for themselves ""light and warmth"". Painful as the experience was for author Sister Lavinia Byrne, she also could appreciate the humor."
3,"Interesting, but not the best","This book does not cover theological issues behind the ordination/non-ordination of women in the Catholic Church in depth. However, since the Vatican has demanded its withdrawal by the publisher, it must either have content that is seen as threatening by the Vatican or else the Vatican is just using a minor incident to show others how it can flex its muscles.The CTSA report on women's ordination and infallible statements is much more useful if you're looking for canon law and theology instead of personal narrative."
3,A Man's View of the Dating Game,"Rodney Hampton watched his partner Tim, repeat his vows and wondered why his life wasn't there and did a special lady ever make him want to be there? Rodney compiled a list of the 133 women he had known, narrowed the list to the 3 women who had left the deepest impression and looked each of them up to see if love really was better the second time around. After running into several walls, Rodney realized he was doing this the wrong way and wondered if he were passing something, while looking back? He slows down, stops trying to recapture his past and when he does he learns that someone has him on their list.George shows us a sensitive male view of the dating game, love, commitment and maturity. You recognize Rodney's fears, you see him grow and you know he's finally becoming a man.aNN BrownThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
2,I must have missed something,This is the first novel that I've read by this author. In my opionion the novel contained one too many characters. The novel could have been better. I will not recommend this one. Maybe next time. Be Blessed.
2,Did not keep me interested!,"This is the second novel I have read by this author and would have to say that I was not impressed with this one as well. I only kept reading the book because I like to start what I finish but overall I was not impressed with the characters or the story line. He focused to much on his sister and her 3 children out of wedlock, clothing, and the character development/story line was weak."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I could only read the beginning 8 chapters. The book was just dragging along. No excitement, what so ever."
2,Having a Hard Time Finishing,After reading E Lynn Harris's synopis on the cover I was looking forward to a very interesting novel. However I find this book quite boring and long.
3,One Woman Short,"I like the story line, it was interesting to see another book written by a brother that has a sensitive side, but that was just it. Another book about men chasing women and then finally realizing that his friends are moving on and therefore they need to get with the program. Rodney Hampton was a typical man trying to get his life together after a monumental event reshapes his best friend's life. I thought it was sad that his friend, Tim, had to get married before Rodney realized that he needed to get his life together and move on. I think it is even worse that he had to revisit old relationships to try and find a mate. He was shallow as were the characters in the book. No one was developed enough so that we could follow and feel for them. The three women on the list had worse problems than Rodney and that was sad! I thought there were some extraneous characters in there that didn't need to be and they didn't enhance the story at all...."
1,Too slow and not that interesting,"This book was short on a lot of things. Excitement, good story line, and did I mention it was short on excitement. On one hand I was excited to read a book by a brother, the plot at first had possibilities. The book is about a man who wants to figure out where he went wrong in his relationship and try to salvage it if he can with one of three women. The only reason I finished the book was due to the chapters being short!!! If you can please borrow this book from the library!!!!!! It was a yawner."
2,This book severly lacked depth,"This book started off with a little promise, but quickly followed similiar themes of past novelist...Eric Jerome Dickey for starters. What lack of imagination and complete bore. Excellent remedy for insomina. Total Yawn."
3,Pretty Good!,"I love a good and just ending and that is what I got! Under pressure from many sources our hero decides to search for that 'one woman'. On his quest he picks 3 women out of 133 other lovers that he's had. This leads the hero to examine himself and what he wants. I must say...the 3 women he had to choose from were some of the sorriest sisters! They were all from one extreme to the other creating a disfigured triangle of disfunction. The women all had a story, that gave the reader little understanding of why the main character would want to bother with any of them. Anyway, I think Nelson George is a good writer and appreciate his ability to move from commentary to fiction. 'One Woman' is not a waste of money."
3,Good Story But Could Have Been Written Differently,"The premise of One Woman Short is simple: 33-year old Rodney has a best friend who gets married. Rodney begins to reflect on his life and wonder if any of his past lovers could be his future mate. In my opinion, the writer didn't really stick to the main focus of the book; it seemed there was a lot of emphasis on Rodney's career, and inclusion of tons of characters who didn'dt seem to belong in this story.On one hand I enjoyed reading about Rodney's observations regarding LA, the entertainment industry, and his female love interests. On the other hand, I truly wished there could have been less narrative and more dialogue in this otherwise well written story. The good thing is there are quite a few laugh out loud sentences in this book and you do learn a lot about commercial shoots, etc. Even though this isn't my favorite Nelson George book, I do enjoy his other works and look forward to reading more fiction by him."
3,Just OK...,"One Woman Short is the story of Rodney a 30 something AA male, who decides on the day of his best friends wedding, that he needs to find the right woman. He makes a list of all the different women he has been with over the years, and eventually narrows it down to 3 women.The story deals alot with Rodney's PR business and the people that he represents. We never really get to know the 3 women who are the chosen ones on his list. They are mentioned, but there is not alot of book space for them. The book just kind of leaves you hanging. There were some funny parts to the book, but again nothing to get excited over.I wish much success and blessing to Nelson George. Peace!"
2,Lackluster...,"The book held my attention, mostly out of curiosity, for the first several chapters...But, let me tell you...I struggled to read the remaining chapters, simply hoping it would get interesting, even a little....that didn't happen."
1,Incredible rip-off,"This is one of the poorest videos I have ever had the sorry luck to come to posess. It is less than 22 minutes long, and only contains 2 minutes and 7 seconds of film containing Jigoro Kano, the subject of the video. This is including some quarter screen shots during the opening credits, and a three second clip of him smiling. The filler is smarmy documentary including tons of camera shots lingering on still photos, and even silly cartoon drawings. One might think, with the video being only (not quite) 22 minutes long, they wouldn't need to recycle footage, but presto, there is a two minute segment, not including Kano, that you get to watch twice. After you suffer through the 22 minute fiasco that the producer calls a collector's item, they have the gall to tack on a 6 minute 'video catalog' of their other products. The catalog spends more time on the screen than the subject of the film. Absolutely infuriating."
5,Wonderful...,"Beautiful mix of angst, artistry and wit. Jonathan's music takes you deep beyond the surface of his words. Gorgeous acoustic arrangements with perfectly placed backup.When is the next one coming Jonathan?"
1,This product made my skin much worse.,"After reading many positive reviews for this product - I decided to buy a sample size to use when I have an occasional breakout. I followed the directions and the next day, my face was extremely dry, flaky and irritated. I found this unusual, as I don't have particularly sensitive skin. I continued to use it - but only at night, right before bed. After the third day, my cheeks and forehead were covered with acne. I am 39 and had never had so many pimples in my life. I suppose this product works for others but not for me. I strongly suggest buying a sample size first."
5,Country music has a new name: Redmon & Vale,"Redmon & Vale's CD is what country music has been waiting for. The songs have that down to earth sound filled with heart, soul, and harmony that makes you feel good all over. These ladies are very talented and it shows through their music. Look out Shania and Dixie Chicks - there's a new vocal sound in town."
1,Horrible!!!,"It is not just the inane monster unintelligibly squealing like ""Cousin It"" nor the equally banal teaching style that make this tape offensive. When a child repeatedly lunged at a soda can with a hunting knife to help illustrate a phonics lesson we removed the tape from the VCR and disposed of it promptly."
5,the mother of all conpiracies - bar none!,"i read this niffty little book way back in the mid-70s on a plane ride back from the pacific and good thing the plane made no other stops because i would've not gotten off. as it was, this was a non-stop and so was my reading. i began page one, thought i'd while away the hours reading, put the book down, sleep, read again, eat, etc., but from page one - i was hooked! while simply a plot for the ages and fancied at that, then came 9/11 and the book was forefront in my mind. i won't give the plot or anything else away - but let me say this: i have NEVER read anything that had left an impression on me like this book/plot has done. way out there was my first impression but as the ages past, it's not so 'out there' as once thought. you have got to read this overlooked gem! can't make a movie out of this one - history has already done that! unbelieveable! p.s.: bought this one for my library and it's definitely a keeper!"
4,Handy Suturing Help for EM clerkship,"This is great small handy reference for neophyte practioners and MD/PA/NP students learning the art of wound repair. Many helpful graphs and charts pertaining to such things as timing of suture removal, nerve distribution and suture choice make this great refernce. It did not leave my white while doing my emergency medicine clerkship. Though the fundementals are sound -it could use a revision to incorperate use of tissue glues, as well as relaxation of a couple of unrealistic recommendations (i.e. gowning and masking for uncomplicated lacertions)."
2,Not worth a second viewing!,"The action is ""so so"" while the production quality is that of a high school project. If you were competing and your girlfriend filmed it you would watch it more than once, otherwise it's just a competition like any other.The very best competiton videos are made by Champ Co.in Tokyo who have made it their speciality-videos from other souces are best borrowed from a library.John Edwards, EditorDragon Times Magazine"
4,Great little cookbook for those not wanting to shell out $ for WW,"As someone who had a great success with Weight Watchers in the past, I didn't want to pay the weekly/monthly fee to get back on track with my eating. This was a great alternative- it's great even if you don't want to go on WW but want to carry on a healthy diet. I've only tried a few recipes, but so far they're great. Good alternative ingredients. The only downside is what other people said - they don't tell you what a portion is (but you can figure it out with most of them)."
1,"Who has mussels, veal, and escarole on hand!","I was excited to receive this cookbook convinced that it would help me cook for my family now that I'm a ""weight watcher"". Sadly I was very disappointed. I'm no gourmet chef. I have basic ingredients on hand and I can't afford to buy expensive fresh herbs and exotic foods. So needless to say, the extraordinary number of recipes containing such ingredients in this cookbook left me with very few recipes that I could actually use. The few recipes I have managed to find all the ingredients for have turned out less than perfectly appetizing. Frankly I think this cookbook is more for rich people who live in big cities within walking distance of fresh food markets, not for suburban moms."
4,Great cookbook!,"First off I want to say that I absolutely love that they tell you the points for each serving of the meal as well as calories, fat, sodium, etc. I'm following the weight watchers diet, while my husband has his own system going, so having all the info is awesome. :)I've had this recipe book for a couple of months now, and lately I've been using it almost daily for suppers. Some of the foods are absolutely awesome! The Mulligatawny (no idea if i spelled that right) is amazing, Southern ""Fried"" Chicken great for any day, and the Cabbage Apple soup is great. There's also been some real nasty stuff that's come out of the book too (do NOT try the artichoke chicken packets, they are just plain nasty).So basically the book is very convenient for people following weight watchers or just trying to eat better in general, and I would highly recommend it to others. :)"
3,It's OK.... not sure it's worth the money,"I requested this cookbook as a Christmas present. I received it and wanted to immediately use it, so I sat down with it for a review of the recipes. I was VERY disappointed that there were no recipes for anything I would ""normally"" make. I expected there to be healthy versions of ""comfort foods"" and I expected points values for those things I eat most (that are still relatively healthy for you). Too bad there aren't ""normal"" recipes in there. Anyone want my copy? I won't be using it. I gave it 3 stars because I figure it could be useful to SOMEONE, just not me."
4,Weight Watchers & South Beach Diet,"I've had several friends swear by using the Weight Watchers program. My family prefers South Beach Diet, but both stress healthy eating and limiting (or better yet, eliminating) simple carbs. I purchased the cookbook to supplement the recipes for the South Beach Diet. Both use spices and herbs to give you a flavorful punch to all your meals. In working my way through the recipes, almost all I'd make again. Several are excellent and I've only found a few duds. But, even the ones I wouldn't make again have given me inspiration to make something similar with some simple tweaks. I recommend this cookbook."
2,not exactly for the small town girl,"It does have some really good recipes, but if your from a small town like me, some of the things are not located at the local grocery store."
5,GREAT FOR ANYONE,I use this cookbook all the time. Weither or not you are on Weight Watchers this book has wonderful stuff. My hubby loves the Southern Oven Fried Chicken.
2,not what I was looking for...,"I was dissappointed with this cookbook. It has a few good recipes, but it seemed like everything has about 20 ingredients and half of them I have never heard of before and don't have the time to locate them either. It seemed a little too complicated for someone with a busy schedule. I have yet to find a Weight Watchers cookbook that I like."
3,"Great ideas, too many exotic ingredients","I give this book 3 stars because I have to buy something special for almost every recipe! While I love the recipes and love even more that everything is easy to read, cook and calculate, I don't love that most use fresh herbs (which can be expensive and difficult to store for long periods of time) and exotic ingredients. I'm sure this enhances the flavor of the food and makes it more satisfying but give me something more practical to cook, Weight Watchers! I do, however, really like all the pictures!"
3,It's alright,Disappointed - advertised as new but was used. Content of cookbook is fine; just feel deceived and probably won't make another purchase.
3,review,The recipes in this book could use a little more revison to become healthier and lower in points. The cover is hard bound and beautiful but the inside needs work.
2,"Shame, shame Weight Watchers!","The prepping directions for Weight Watchers recipes are more complicated than they need to be. Also, too many exotic indredients are used. I can't find these items in my grocery store and there is no way my kids are going to eat things like Mango Chutney. I would have liked to know how big each portion is. If I was good at knowing how much to eat, I wouldn't be overweight. Another thing that bothered me was that this book was actually a cheaply made plastic comb edition and was printed in China! Weight Watchers doesn't make enough money, they have to cut corners by printing and assembling this book in China?"
3,Nothing Spectacular,"This book didnt thrill me. Nothing spectacular here, weird foods that are suppossed to be good for you, but the average american family would be hard pressed to feed the whole family with these concoctions."
5,Love It!,"I ordered this book in hopes I could find a few good recipes. Well, I love everyone I have tried so far, and so does the whole family. The recipes taste great and they are very good for you as well. I would recommend it to anyone, wheather your watching your weight or not!"
5,Best WW cookbook by far,"This is the best weight watchers cookbook I have ever seen. The recipes are not only delicious, but they use ingredients that most of us have on hand or can easily get. My husband (not on weight watchers) has loved every recipe that I have made so far. These are not ""diet"" food recipes, just good, healthy eating recipes :o)"
3,"Good, but bland","I love the points system. I think it is tremendous. This is a great cookbook with lots of good ideas for cooking light. The problem is that nothing is spicy! We are a spicy family & it has been hard to find recipes in this albeit large cookbook that are flavorful enough to suit us. So, my recommendation is to keep the sliced, fresh jalapenos, salsa, garlic and chipotle tabasco handy to add to these recipes as needed. :)"
3,Not Points Plus,It was my fault that I did not notice that this book is from 2007 when I ordered it. It is ok but it is not a Points Plus book and has alot of obscure recipes from other contries that I would never make. There are only a few pictures throughout the book. I like to have a picture of every finished dish. Overall not bad but out of date if you are following the current Points Plus program.
4,Weight Watchers Cookbook Is Yummy,"I like to cook, but was having trouble finding recipes that fit into the Weight Watchers program in my cookbooks. This cookbook contains tons of recipe that I've been trying out to assess which ones my husband and I like. I've kept notes of the good dishes so I can cook them again. So far, the only dish that's really failed the husband taste-test is the meat loaf. My regular meat loaf recipe is better and seems to contain no more calories than the WW meat loaf.Trying these recipes is fun and adventurous. The major problem with them is that each of them requires ingredients that I wouldn't normally have on hand. I've bought some of the ingredients, but given that only two of us are eating, I can't buy and store anything that will spoil. If I were to suggest a change, I would ask that recipes be developed with ingredients that people already around the house. Otherwise, the book is great."
2,Good cook book but not your everyday recipes,"I was looking for everyday recipes for the foods everyday people eat. The insert says it all with a display (looks good)of dolmades, roasted red pepper dip, and Hummus. While the book did have French Onion Soup and Clam Chowder; it also had Yogurt soup with lamb meatballs and Lentil and Swiss Chard. Many of the dish ingredients are not found in a typical grocery store but are found in a specialty store or Farmers/World market. Bottomline: While there are a LOT of recipes I would be willing to cook about 20 percent."
5,Good Menu Book,"Very good and diverse recipes for ""dieting"". I'm using quotation marks because these menus don't make you feel like you're dieting. Shipper got it to me very fast, earlier than the estimated arrival"
4,great recipes,"it's a great book for recipes that are quite innovative. I had wished for more menus, week menu, grocery list and the like. i have enjoyed cooking and developing meals with this book. It a good staple book to have"
4,Good receipes and easy to follow,I found this book very helpful and with many delicious receipes that I am able to cook to assist my wife with her weight watchers program.Portions are sizable and very tasty.
2,Very disappointing!,"I was excited to get this book, as Weight Watchers' Take-Out Tonight is one of my favorites, and many recipes I have gotten from the WW website are really good. However, the recipes here were not good--I have tried several and all of them have been passable at best.None have been awful, but the flavors are off--for instance, with the Bow Ties with Asparagus and Salmon, the combination of sour cream, mustard, and white wine (all things I love by the way) came off as too sour/acidic. The Scallops with Parsley-Brandy Pesto, which sounded wonderful, didn't taste that great and the pesto overpowered, rather than complemented, the scallops.On the plus side, the range of recipes is huge and the ring binding is nice. I'll keep trying and hopefully will find something I'd make again."
5,Great WW Cookbook,"This is like the ""new"" Betty Crocker cookbook for the new millineum. Healthy, tasty ideas and recipes. Love the spiral pages. Easy to read and would definetly recommend this book."
2,Weight Watchers New Complete Cookbook,"I am disappointed in the content of this book. There is a large number of recipes that are foreign based that are not in the least bit enticing to me. My family and I don't care for numerous seasonings that are used, especially those of mideastern origin. I don't think the cookbook was advertised honestly. I was under the impression it was presenting recipes that most of us Americans would enjoy in a healthy, diet-friendly format. However, a very large part of it is an ethnic selection. I would not recommend this cookbook to anyone I know. Incidentally, I cook often, cook a variety, and am good at it, so my disastisfaction is not due to lack of knowledge or experience."
4,Exceptional sound quality on Banana Boat Song,"To add to the other reviews, Eric apparently found a pristine first-generation master of the Banana Boat Song. Prior to acquiring this CD I had assumed that the original tape must have been damaged. Why? Because on Rhino's Troubadours of the Folk Era Volume III the song exhibits numerous crackles and pops. Not here, however. Flawless quality."
1,An absolute piece of [junk]!,"Forgive my harshness, but this book is one of the few worst cooking books I've ever seen. It offers nothing useful to the professional, and very little by way accurate tips, advice or help to the home cook. Save your [money]..."
5,FINALLY with an English dub!,"The new 2011 re-release of Magical Witch Punie comes with an all new dub that was created for this release. Dubbed by the wonderful and talented group at Headline Studios, this release should satisfy those who were waiting for an English dub to be released when the original discs were pressed back in 2008.The show is hilarious and definitely worth a look.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
5,Magical Witch Punie-Chan,If you like anime and magical girls but don't care for rainbows and sunshine this is your show. This cute little magical girl is pure evil to everyone but her little sisters but her little sisters are not nice to her. This show made me laugh until I was crying tears of joy and laughing hard enough to make my stomach bleed. It is as twisted and evil as I think you'll ever see a magical girl!
2,Flatten out - PLEASE! COLD CAUTION,"The mats look great on the pictures but mine are yet to sit flat - 2 weeks and counting, i have purchased garage mats before with much better success, these look great - but the material is very light and will not lay flat especially the corners, I think the summer heat will flatten the mats, so if you are in a warm climate go for it. if you are in cold climates, proceed with caution, mine curl ""ends"" on cold days. The instructions claim 48 hours for the material to flatten, it has been 2 weeks and no such luck.I fear the curled end are a trip hazard, especially with children or on that rush out of the house day!"
3,good but not great,"This is a nice addition to the garage but it's not a very precise floor covering. The material is quite soft which makes it fairly simple to lay and cut, but it also means it can be lumpy in areas and easily scuffed. Often just driving onto the floor will cause some bunching up under the tires. When doing work on it, you'll feel inclined to cover the floor covering which seems to defeat the purpose. Although, I find it useful to use an extra strip of the flooring and lay it upside-down to work on which makes it more comfortable to stand/kneel on and easy to clean."
