1,How long is the hose?,How long is the hose? It doesn't say anywhere that I can find. What kind of outfit sells hoses without telling you how long the hose is?
5,I love it and my Dog loves it!,"I have a hairy dog and he needed a bath and I didn't want to make another mess in my tub. I bought this and at first it didn't fit my Meon kitchen faucet.I went to the hardware store and bought another adapter (it comes with one adapter) and crossed my fingers.It worked and it worked great! My dog loved his bath on the deck and actually stood still for it.One word of caution which might be the problem with some of you. Turn the water on very low it does make a very hard stream which is probably why some are experiencing leaking. It is not high tech just a nice little hose,it does not take alot of water to make a strong stream.I washed the dog then watered my plants I can't complain.I will never have a dirty dog again."
3,watering hose lacks connector,"I was excited to try out the indoor plant watering hose. I could not hook it up to the faucet in the sink. I was warned that I would need to find some connectors when I read other reviews of this product. However, I did not realize I would have such a hard time finding the right connector. I would really like to know why the manufacturer does not include something to make this work right off the bat. I have looked and looked and have had this hose for at least a month now with no luck getting it set up."
2,Look for a better product,"I have a standard sink faucet in the kitchen. You can unscrew the aerator from the end of the faucet and there is a treaded ""hole"" there. This is a pretty standard size and as far as I can remember every faucet I've ever had had the same size female threads.This hose comes with a female faucet connector that will not fit the standard faucet. I had to buy two adapters to get this to work. First a ""Hose Thread Adapter"" that screwed into the standard faucet and which provides a standard garden hose screw connection. Then I bought a hose thread to the smaller thread adapter to accomodate this hose.All of this screws together. Another hose I had a long while ago came with a snap on connector and screwed right into the standard faucet female adapter."
1,GRRRR!,"This is hateful thing! I ordered the 2 ""suggested"" connectors with this. The hose as it came wouldn't fit the faucet, and neither of the 2 connector sets fit either! DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Same Book as Old-fashioned Fruit Crate Labels,"I bought this book and Old-Time Fruit Crate Labels in Full Color because I was interested in using some of the labels for decoupage. Imagine my surprise when I received them and found out the books have exactly the same labels inside--Full-Color Fruit Crate Labels just has the CD-ROM and a different cover.The labels are beautiful and I will be using them, but I am disappointed that it is not possible to determine from the book descriptions that they have the same labels. Oh well, I'm giving my extra copy to our local library."
3,"ok, but not what I was hoping for","I think this book is ok, but not exactly what I was expecting. I was hoping for more fruit labels with actual pictures of fruit on them; the kind of thing you see at old orchards and farm stands. This had lots of fruit labels but they just didn't focus on the fruit like I was hoping."
3,Don't expose to heat or sun.,"I loved this bag until the weather started to warm up. Right now, I have black dye from the ""leather"" on the bag all over my arm, clothing, and legs."
4,woah....I,"I remember seeing this band play this record, in a small dark theater in the country.It was a peculiar blast of sonic bliss. They were tight. Really tight.This record is beautiful record of that time. The instruments really shine through.Buy it."
5,Beautiful record,"She's not a well-known lady, but deserves to be: minimalist late-night folk songs that will appeal to people who like Mirah, Veda Hille, or Julie Dorion. Some of the stuff is almost mournful, but at other times defiant or deliciously awkward. The lyrics are very smart. My favorites are Bounty and Complete, but the album works as a whole. Also check out her album New Problems."
4,short but sweet,"Although this almanac is a bit on the short side, it is packed with information on the cougar, including a lot of information not found elsewhere. The photos are good, and the maps are fine, but it is the colorful writing that caught my eye on this one. Many almanacs are dry dry dry. This is one is not and should be purchased by anyone who loves the big cats."
1,author is biased towards houndsmen and hunters of pumas,"buy a copy of harley shaw's ""soul among lions"" and you will have a better understanding of the puma's role in the west"
5,A Great CD!,Another great CD from Mars Lasar. Just like Mars's previous album Olympus Mars makes great keyboard sounds. I picked this CD up at BORDERS only knowing Hidden Crater from the radio. When I started listening to it I thought it was great the CD is good from the beginning to the end. On the eleventh hour the 16 songs are about hope for a world in crisis. Every song on the album I thought was good but my favorite song still was Hidden Crater for the darkness in the song. If you like new age music then this is the album for you. Believe me you will not be DISAPPOINTED!
2,Communism...,"I never paid for a word of communism and a burp before. The rest of the CD is not bad, but it does not deserve the top rating."
5,EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS,"I don't know how the camera will hold up in the long run but we just got back from Las Vegas and the photos that were taken with this camera were just beautiful. Extremely sharp, great (hand held) night photos, colours were great. We are extremely pleased with the results and hope the camera will be with us for a long time."
1,Not a true USB UPS.,"The UPS unit has a DB9 connector. An adapter cable to USB is included, but requires a different driver than other APC models that have a direct USB interface. I worked with tech support for 2 months and haven't gotten it to work reliably: it works for about a week, then loses communication. They ran out of ideas and I've given up wasting time on it.I need a UPS that will shut down my server reliably in the event of a power outage, so I've relegated this one to supplying my network gear: it seems fine for that purpose."
1,If only I could give this piece of crap 0 stars,"I just bought this can opener 3 weeks ago, and since I first used it, it's been skipping portions of cans. It can't even seem to cut these sections on a second (or third or fourth) try. In fact, I just cut myself attempting to pry open a can. Don't buy it."
2,Broke after one year,"The Kitchen Aid can opener seemed very sturdy when I bought it, and in fact it still *looks* sturdy. But it stopped working after about a year, even though I never used it more than once or twice a week."
1,What a piece of junk!,"Bought this about a year ago. It opened cans for only a couple of months. Now it only opens half the can no matter how many times you go over it. You also have to squeeze super hard to get it to work even that good!I thought Kitchenaid was supposed to be good stuff. Based on my experience with this, I'll be very hesitant to purchase anything with this brand name on it again."
3,Great for a while then...not so great,"When I first began using this can opener, I loved it. But, after several months it seemed to be getting dull & I could turn the knob but it wouldn't cut or even move. I was very surprised that it wasn't more durable. I replaced it with an opener by OXO which has been awesome."
5,steady as a rock,"Typical Kitchen Aid appliance - does the job, does it well and simply and dependably, without a lot of fuss."
2,Longevity isn't it's strong point,"I was thrilled with this product when I first received it:""Nice and big...doesn't get lost in the kitchen drawer...big, sturdy handles to hold onto, nice big knob for easy turning. No more fumbling and sore hands from puny knobs, and skinny handles.""Unfortunately in less than a years time span it went the way of similar can openers, trembling in fear at the sight of a can and refusing to cut through or half cut through any can it came across. For as well made as it seemed to be, I've had cheaper can openers that lasted far longer.After it's demise it was replaced with a Zyliss safe-edge can opener, which after over 3 years of daily use is still going strong."
3,"In the beginning, beautiful...soon, a pain","When we first recieved this can opener, we were thrilled. It worked so beautifully that we stopped using our electric one. It wasn't but a couple months into it before it started skipping spots on a can lid. Frequent deep cleaning, ( at least once a week), improves it, but it still skips at least twice on an average soup can lid. I love Kitchen Aid, but this product is not worth it's weight or drawer space."
2,would not use this at work again,"This is a nice item,but for me as a souf chef I bought this item to use at work,but as far as using this for large cans it does not work for me,never seems to open the can with out going over it three or four times.around my house its great but i would not and will not ever use this at work again"
1,Not what I expected from KitchenAid,"I LOVE KitchenAid, so when the can opener we got for our wedding got lost in our last move, I grabbed the Kitchen Aid one off the shelf assuming that the quality would be what I had come to expect from the company. I could not have been more wrong. It looks solid enough to get the job done (and in fact, the handle was pretty solid), but there is something quirky with the blade. Either it's misaligned or just not sharp enough...All I know is we hate it and threw it out after realizing we were letting something as stupid as a can opener drive us crazy! We grabbed a cheap one from the grocery store to tide us over until we got a ""real"" one, and I have to say it it a hundered times better than the Kitchen Aid. This can opener won't ruin your life, but it's not worth the hassle."
2,This booked saved my neck!,"I am a new Children's Director and on my first Sunday I found myself in the elememntry school Sunday School classroom (it's k- 5th grade together) that did not have a teacher. I was able to pull this book out and give the children up bet and fun activities that stress Biblical principles, as well as reached each child on their own cognative level. I am a college student majoring in Children's Ministry and am highly impressed at how well this books teaching methods cover everything that I am learning. (ex. uses the different learning styles, has a ""Hook"", ""Book"", ""Look"", and ""Took"".) I highly recommend this book for a group that is small and has a variety of ages."
3,Sunday School Specials,"I purchased this for our summer sunday school program with hopes that it would fit the age range we work with (preK through seniors in high school). I was disappointed. The curriculum is much more geared to preK through 3rd, maybe 4th grade. I had to alter, add to it for the middle schoolers and definitely the high schoolers were bored. The idea is to get the older kids helping the younger kids with the crafts/lessons/etc. but - let's be honest - high schoolers generally like to hang with high schoolers, not kindergarteners! It has fine lessons but it is definitely not geared to a broad age-group."
2,Keylock Man,I reveived the book but when I got it the back cover was torn and the outside was not in very good condition. I cant say that I will order any more books from this seller.
3,So-So,This book was hailed as the next Maeve Binchy. Afraid not! Nice story but lacks the depth of a book by Binchy.
2,CD did not work,"The CD did not work on my computer. It is an old product so it works on Windows XP, but that was the last version it worked on. I have windows 7.I used an older computer, and it did work, but i ended up buying a different program from the local office store. The only thing i used from the Invent It kit, was the paper."
2,It Broke!,"It was great while it lasted, but the garlic press handle broke off easily, and we had to replace it with a sturdier brand."
5,This is great buy,I have replaced Olympus Stylus zoom camera I had used for the last five years with this one. I simply love this camera. It's smaller than Olympus with more features and cost less. Awesome buy!
4,A wonderful book!,"This book is just the beginning of a series full of good-character and fun-filled adventures. It will keep you interested the whole way through. With tales of every good or bad event that Jim encounters on his many early morning rounds to aid the animals of his English countryside, this book is a celebration to life. James Herriot makes the books come alive with his expertise in writing. A great book!"
1,smelly book,"This book was very mildewy with brown edges to the book. I was going to send it back, but sprayed it with Melaleuca's Solumel and it took the smell and brown coloring away. I would not have been able to read it otherwise due to the smell!"
5,Excellent stories about the life of a British vet,"Since first reading James Herriot I was drawn to the richly told, heart-warming stories. The characters he details almost seem to become real in the reading. I have enjoyed each of the books from this series."
2,Hate it,"Ok well unlike the other reviewers, I hate this ice cream scoop. Yes, it's heavy and seems to be well-engineered. However, I don't like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it. And as another reviewer already mentioned, it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed. When I'm scooping the ice cream, the water drips out and down the handle, thus making it even harder to grip the handle. It makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and I get ice cream all over my hand. I have a cheap $2 plastic scoop that I bought when I was in college, and I prefer it to this one."
5,A sound and practical reference for healthy living!,"As the author, I feel that this book contains practical,psychologically sound Cues to enable each person to measure what is healthy and unhealthy and to remedy this behavior in Self Cue Therapy. The book deals with here and now common issues that prevail with most people."
3,Better for older kids,I bought this for my 6 year old and it is a little too advanced for her. Not many pictures but well written for a child 8-10 I would say.
1,Not Biblicaly accurate,Read the first book about Adam and Eve they did not build a rock tower for their forgiveness of sins. Did not read any more. Where is creation? Should be before Adam and Eve. Creation in itself shows the magnitude of GOD. I realized it is geared to young readers but don't distort GOD's word.
1,Disapointed,I was looking ilustrated version so I could use it as a teaching tool this is of no use to me and was a waste of my money
2,Didn't care for this,"I don't care for this item. It's a nice tool, but it's too difficult for me to use!"
4,Great soap,"I had rash and a friend told me about carbolic soap so I went on line and look it up, I then purchase a few bars and it work very well the rash is now gone.I will continue to use this soap because it is a very good product and it smell great.Island Pride Carbolic Soap"
1,It's Just Volume 1 With A Different Cover!,"Volume 2? I think not! The songs on this album are the exact songs from volume 1. Breat Banjo tunes, (don't get me wrong) but don't expect different songs in volume 2....."
5,"Season One is Fantastic, Where are the OTHER Seasons?","I know I am not the only one who is wondering when or if more of the Murphy Brown seasons are going to be released. It has been 9 months since Season One was released. Other shows have had 2-3 seasons released in that time frame. Murphy Brown was a cultural phemomenon, why the dragging of the feet when it comes to releasing other seasons. Am I going to be in an old age home before I can buy all of the seasons? WB needs to hurry up, us MB fans are getting anxious!"
5,Best show ever!,This show is still so funny after all these years! The only problem i have with it is that they have not released the rest of the seasons! Hurry up and release all of hte Murphy Brown seasons please!!!!
4,When will you release more seasons?,I purchased this for a friend who likes this show. She has told me she has watched the DVD over and over. I keep checking for the release of more seasons but no luck yet!
5,"still funny, hoping for a 2nd season, too","This was a great series, and is still relevant to today, and funny. The set is nicely packaged, and in addition to the series video's, has some interesting commentaries by Candace Bergen about the shows, as addditional material. Highly recommended."
4,"AMAZING Show, waiting for Season Two now.",I bought this the first day that it came out and I must have watched the whole thing over a weekend. Everything about this set was wonderful. The retrospect was very nice and really gave you more insight into the show.In responce to the last comment for all of you. There are a couple of MINOR problems in quality but they are because this show was filmed & taped. In the commentary on Episode one Candice discusses this. But to shorthand it all the shots NOT on FYI were filmed. Everything you saw on the FYI part was Taped. Weird but anyway. Its much harder to fix old film like that so thats why clarity is off a tad in a few spots. I urgee everyone to buy this new classic.
5,Murphy Brown is amazing,"This show is a wonderfully written series that remains completely relevent today. Nick at Night is re-broadcasting the series now and it is just as funny and sharp as ever. Murphy Brown is an amazing character and I'm just thrilled that season 1 has finally been released on DVD. It's nearly impossible to find a strong female lead character on television. In fact, there are only a handful of shows centered around a female character in television history. Murphy was empowered, smart, single and happy. She was always inspirational and always hillarious. Plus the supporting cast was fantastic. You should definitely treat yourself to this DVD set."
2,scracthed,first disk is severly scracthed. it will cost more to send it back than pay to have it repaired.
1,Neurotic with a twist of lime,"If any TV series doesn't deserve the fabulous treatment it gets from its distribution studio, it's Murphy Brown. Murphy is a shrill, man-hating dame who's hell-bent on making her bitterness known to her equally self-absorbed co-workers.Yet worst of all, None of the characters on this show have a solid and unique personality. They're all neurotic with a twist of lime. You've got the neurotic Betty Ford reject, the neurotic investigative reporter, the neurotic-yet-steadfast newscast veteran, the neurotic young go-getter, and the neurotic former beauty pageant queen.Guess which one Miles is."
3,What's the point of DVD,"I love the show, l like to keep it and watch it from time to time. So I bought the DVD. Think it's the case of most people who buy DVD, not just to this show, but to other classics TV programs. You never knew how surprise I was when I saw that vertical blue line coming back from time to time. More surprise was some of the scene were not even properly handled, I guess they just forgot to fix the color and enhance the clarity. It's really pain to see how people disrespect the show. I really want to see all ten seasons to be released in DVD. But if such bad quality were going on to happen in the second seasons (if there was a chance to be released), I am afraid the series won't have enough sales support to the third season."
5,Murphy is Back!,"I am so glad Murphy is back! I have ejoyed each and every episode. I have perfect picture quality without any problems! After watching each episode, I find myself smiling. I am really looking forward to the 2nd season and many more!"
5,Motown Murphy!,"I don't know if it's the best thing about Murphy Brown, but I love how she loves Motown. Unfortunately, it also the DVD's undoing. With the exorbidant (and IMHO ridiculously high) music licenesing fees, we probably aren't going to see the remaining seasons come out.I was overjoyed to see that the original music was kept intact for this release."
4,"Good, but get the 'spade' instead","My mother-in-law has this Kitchen Aid ""scoop"" version. It's good, but not as good as the ""spade"" version. I give this 4 stars by comparison. If you must have round ice cream balls for an ice cream cone, then you could get this, however the spade works much better for scooping ice cream, cutting through easily and scooping plenty. You could still make a ""ball"" if you really wanted to with the spade.I've had my Kitchen Aid Spade for 7 years. It is THE best ice cream scoop(spade) ever. No matter how cold or hard the icecream/yogurt is, the spade cuts right through.These Kitchen Aid ""scoops"" or ""spades"" are better than the types with anti-freeze type liquid which supposedly helps. Don't bother - these Kitchen Aid scoops cut through anything. The handle is perfect and solid, and the whole thing is well-balanced, for both the scoop and space.4 stars for this Scoop, 5 stars for the Spade."
2,"If I wanted a 2 year scoop, I would have paid less...","This was a great scoop. Worked well, looks nice, flashy, but it started to degrade after a year or so. At first it was juat a little mark inside the scoop but it grew. I put up with it but now it's rusting. Nothing worse then scooping out orange vanilla ice cream.For the price I paid, I would have expected this scoop to last longer. Yeah, it's flashy, but I wanted longevity. Next time I'll buy a cheaper scoop."
1,Be Warned!!!!,I too purchased this scoop and as others have said piror it will and has rusted in the inner part of the scoop. I wish I could get my money back but no luck in that so I am in search of a better one. Its kinda sad though that you pay money for name brand products and still be MAJORLY disappointed with cheapness.
1,Pitting Chrome,Like Many others the chrome is pitted in just a few months of normal use.I have contacted KitchenAid to see if they will replace.
2,pitted chrome scoop by Kitchenaid,"This is the second Kitchenaid scoop I have purchased over the years, and it has done the same thing. After only a few months of use, the chrome scoop starts to pit. The whole surface is pitted and gross looking. However, it does still scoop ice cream well enough. For the price, I would expect the scoop to last a lifetime, and keep it's shiny chrome surface."
1,Some Songs are Best Left on the Cutting Room Floor,Just because you become mildly succesful doesn't mean you have to release every studio noodle your band has performed. Please don't release subpar music to make money.
4,"Well worth a listen, or two, or three","Most of the tracks on this offering are lo-fi and just full of washed-out, Pacific Northwest, dreary-day angst. This sound is distinctive from the brighter, fuller sound on their more recent releases. The last 10 tracks are bonus (compiled from various releases), including a Smiths cover, a glitzy-pop dance song, a sample-heavy track with a hint of hip hop rhythms, and a lovely closer.I've come to regard this album as one of my favorites. It is an intensely honest, brazenly youthful, at times lonesome, and ultimately accomplished and varied gathering of tracks. A strong sense of time and place (geographical references abound), a personal remoteness balanced with sense of warmth, and a love of city and home run throughout. It takes such a long time to absorb and to get to know the album that by the time you do, you can't help but have a strong affection for it."
2,works for about a week,"I install cabinets and countertops and have to caulk in the c-tops. Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the greatest caulker, so I bought this at home depot. Well I thought it was great for about a week until the rubber started falling apart and got holes in it. It's way to much money for what it is, your better off buying a cheaper product. Don't waist your money if you plan on needing something like this on a daily basis."
1,Have to agree with the other reviewers,Have to agree with the other reviews. The rubber piece came out of the tool in a short time. It worked fairly well before it broke but not worth the money. Use your finger instead.
1,Extremely Soft Plastic Scraper,Scraper edge looked fantastic in the box but lost its pretty edge literally after the first second of using it. You WILL be highly disappointed if you purchase this product and actually attempt to use it.
5,A SUPER ICE CREAM SPADE!,"No one will ever know how many years I've spent trying to dig rock hard ice cream out of its container. Our size of choice is a 1/2 gal. container (Rocky Road, preferably, and the traditional scoop is almost useless - it just makes little nicks.For a while, in desperation, I popped the container into the mircrowave for about 45 seconds to ""loosen"" the edges - it was still a chore. I found that a soup spoon worked better than the scoop.Then, a friend who knows our penchant for a bowl of the creamy treat before bedtime gifted us with this ice cream spade. It's a perfect tool for serving ice cream. I'm able to dig it into the straight-from-the-freezer container and fill our bowls.Sometimes, it's the little things that make life a joy!"
5,This is art history the way it should be done!,"A good mix of experts with lots of superb graphics. Computer 3D wire simulations. Analysis of original lines and removal of touch-ups that were added over the centuries to ""improve"" the paintings. A gem of a DVD. Lets have more of these for other artists."
5,Appears to antedate the discoveries of Steadman and Hockney,... hence will not include information regarding the camera obscura.This film is a recent DVD release which I haven't yet seen. I'll view it with interest and may update this review.
2,Spongebob Squarepants Books,"I love Spongebob, but I have purchased all of the Spongebob books and I have found that much of what is in each book has been duplicated in more then one book. I think that this is a let down and really unfair, especially to the kids that save up their pennies to buy these books."
2,Less than happy,"I would say it is an OK camera - for its low price.The picture quality is so-so, and the buttons are somewhat hard to reach. I will have to wait and see how the product does in terms of reliability/durability."
3,How many times does it take to load the film?,"I recieved the Samsung 70GL Power Zoom Ultra Compact Camera as a birthday present. It was given to me early so I could take pictures of my daily events during my vacation. I did have trouble loading the film. On several tries, I had to open the loading 'bay' and replace the film. I belive I might have exposed several frames on the roll just to get it to take. Is there some type of problems out there with this particular camera? and if so, is there a fix for them? Please let me know I would like to take full advantage of this product!"
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH MY SAMSUNG CAMERA PURCHASE. ALSO, THE SERVICE FROM AMAZON WAS GREAT. I JUST HAD MY FIRST SET OF PICTURES DEVELOPED AND THEY CAME OUT EXCELLENT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO EVERYONE.JOAN"
5,"If you love poker, you'll love this book!","This book is the ""Catcher in the Rye"" of poker if you will, with most of the book narrated by the hero, Mike the poker player. It is funny, gritty, and if you've played poker seriously, you'll surely be able to relate to both the fortunes and misfortunes that Mike encounters on the felt.The only negative and this is a slight one, is the book could have used a bit more editing."
3,Rehash,"I suppose in everyone's lifetime a work comes along that basically tells the same story once again. That is what I encountered in this particular work. While the author wrote in an engrossing manner, he revealed nothing new to me that I had not already read from different sources. Also, the ""Feud"", if you will, was disappointing in its relevation from this author. I have many other books on the abdication and issues surrouding it that were much better in scope and subject while really bringing the ""Feud"" to life. ""The Windsor Story"" and ""The Woman He Loved"" are just such books."
4,Fairly fair and balanced,"I would like to add to the other review, something I gained: the knowledge that Queen Mary, the Queen Mum's mother-in-law, not a born royal and sometimes the object of derision by the famously haughty Princess Margaret, did not always share all her daughter-in-law's opinions, notably of the infamous Wallis. The speculation that, as a young girl, the Queen Mother had been in love with the Duke of Windsor, also colors heavily the events that followed."
5,a first rate novel about colonial Quebec,Shadows on the Rock is one of Cather's masterpieces. This novel is set inQuebec City in the years 1697 and 1698. The main character Cecile Auclair is the 12 year old daughter of Euclide Auclair the town pharmacist.Cecile is one of the best written and most compelling of all of Cathers creations and her father is as well.There are several intersting characters in the novel. Cathers poers of description are first rate not only in describing Quebec City but also the natural landscape of Quebec.There are a lot of extra nice touches like some recountings of saints stories and the political situation in France at the time. This is a 5 star book in my opinion and I recommend it highly
4,Epic story of life in cold Canada,"If you like to read about the past... before microwaves, blow dryers, cable TV, etc. and want to feel ""REAL"" life... this book is for you. If you like to read about how our ancestors trudged thru hardships and challenges to give us our comfy lives today... this is for you. If you want action packed adventure with a twisting plot and a climactic ending... don't buy this book."
2,What a Boring Book,"Shadows on the Rock was a really really boring book! It didnt focus on any one subject and kinda just drifted from story to story. Why, a lot of the words were written in french. I would feel sorry for a person reading this book that has no french knowledge. I kept finding myself reading the same page several times before i realized that i had read it already. It doesnt capture your attention. I have one word for this book. BORING!"
4,Must have DVD set!,"Although the first season was a slow start to this great show, it is still a great season. Since it appears that this will be the only season to make it to DVD, a true fan of the Wayans Brothers must have this set. I bought this with no hesitation because it brings great laughs to friends and family."
4,buy this have some fun :),"real comedy in this tv series for wayans bros ( what a family ) hhhhabout fun and the tv series i will give it 5 stars , but because its short just two cd`s i gave it 4 .maybe i though it too short because its too fun ."
3,What Up with Martin?????!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love the wayans bros dont get me wrong, but c'mon how you gonna have jamie foxx and the Wayans Bros out before the Martin show? I can understand the fresh Prince of bel air becuse it was about time for that. But lets be real its time for the martin series,even my family and friends wonder when this masterpiece will come out. Come on now!!! Damn ""Gimme a Break"" and ""Webster"" even got DVD's out,c'mon 20th Century Fox lets get it together if somebody anybody Knows when that DVD comes out Let me know."
2,average,"Shawn&Marlon Wayans have had some moments,but on a whole they are better backing there Older Brothers when it comes to performing Comedy. this show was Hit&Miss at best.nothing that really stood out but it some moments."
3,No more seasons on DVD?,"What's going on, what, no season two, three, huh? Where's the rest of the shows at?! Season one was the weakest link to the chain if you know what I'm sayin'. Man, I been waiting for Pop's chili for the Pope episode, the I'm your daughter (this chili tastes like sh- MARLON!!) joint, and let me not forget Pop's For Governor. If you read this review, demand that we got the rest of the show because they left us hangin' with first collection. We want bonus features, commentaries, more outtakes if any (besides the ones during the credits,) and that would be more than enough for me. HOLLA IF YA HEAR ME!!! ONE."
5,LOVE!!!,Awesome... I would love more episodes!!! The Wayans Brothers always crack me up :-) very satisfied with my purchase! 5 STARS!
5,comedy,Great price for a classic comedy show. I purchased for me brother in law for christmas and it was an instant hit. Cant beat that.
5,hesterical,i would do anything to have warnerbros release more seasons...the wayan bros is simply hesterical
2,not really worthed,"This modem came in with my Dell Piii550 and, I must admit, I amnot really satisfied by it. Although I didn't encounter any problems with windows drivers, this IS a winmodem and therefore won't work under linux. In addition, I can never get a better connection than 45.2k (may be due to noisy phone) line and, last but not least, pings for online gaming are high. You can get faster hardware modem that you can use under linux for a cheaper price."
3,GOOD SELECTION OF OLD COUNTRY,"I like coutry music and I am satisfied with this cd. It has a lot of variety and the sound is good. That being said, it is a little too ""twangy"" for my taste. If you like the old county sound and you like that ""twangy"" sound that goes with some of the old country, you will love this cd."
1,worst press I've ever owned,"Even the ones from Pick and save were better. First it takes the strength of Hulk Hogan to press whole cloves, then the handle broke and went flying across the room! Never again and their hand held cheese grater is not too great either, grates fine, but that handle broke off as well! No more Kitchenaid only my beloved stand mixer wich I give 10 stars."
2,it broke,"Worked great for over a year. Cleaning it isn't so easy even with the little thing they give you. Then one day during normal use, the plastic handle snapped off. I moved to an all metal version to aviod this happening in the future."
2,Not what it seems,"At first look you might think the metal extends the full length of the handles. Well, it doesn't. Under the red plastic is black plastic. It was great while it lasted. But the hidden black plastic broke. Oh, it lasted over a year. Not too convenient for us since it only has a one year warranty. Our next press will be all metal. Not just an illusion of ""all metal."""
2,Happy Until it Broke,"I thought this was a well built garlic press because it is heavy. Heavy however, doesn't mean heavy duty. The handle's plastic part broke away from the metal portion of the handle while using it to press one piece of garlic. I have used this product weekly for the past year and never had a problem with it's quality until today."
3,Great until it broke,I have owned two of these Kitchenaid garlic presses. They work great for awhile. Eventually (less than 2 years) the plastic handle will snap off due to the inherent design flaw. The plastic is merely glued to the metal which creates a weak area. I would recommend another press.
2,Looks great but...,"I got one of these based on the hefty look and feel. It worked great for about 6 months but finally the plastic handle gave out. Granted we do use some big cloves of garlic but I think it was really due to the plastic handle just not being strong enough for repeated stress.Zyliss Susi was our last press (for over 10 years) and it will be the next one, too."
2,Design flaws disappoint,"I bought this garlic press because of the Kitchenaid name and because I got tired of processing so many cloves of garlic with just a chef's knife. When we got it, my husband (who shares cooking duty) was delighted at how it felt in his hands and at how much time it saved him. I was disappointed with the size - a little too large for my average-size female hands. Design flaw #1. I rallied and continued to use it (with both hands) for about a year and a half. Yesterday, the handle cracked and broke off. The metal portion of the press does not extend down the handle. Design flaw #2. I was pressing one small clove so I'm sure the break was not due to misuse. I'm going to follow the America's Test Kitchen recommendation and get a Zyliss next time."
1,Plastic handle does not hold up,"I've had this for about 2 months and the handle snapped right off. When it was working it was great, but for the price I expected to get more than 6 uses! I'm very disappointed."
5,Red Hot!,I love garlic and this has been the best garlic press. I've use this almost every day for the last 6 months and it still works and looks great! It's definately worth the money!
1,"design flawed, indeed",Handle just cracked and broke off for mine as well (see previous review). I had bought mine in Nov 2004 and used it about every other day.
1,Are you kidding me?????,I am just stumped this was even released. What era does this come from? Self produced? No duh. Listen to the samples before you by this CD....and hear for your self.
1,Disappointing compared to other CDs/Albums,"This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators. Some of the Craig Chaquico-style stuff was interesting, but better left to Craig. Try 7th Heaven, Mosaico or Guitar Odyssey instead."
5,Slide Thru Shelf and Rod Bracket,These are heavy duty rod and closet shelf brackets that allow clothes hangers to slide all the way along the rod with no impediment.They are easy to install and are of a much higher quality than the flimsy wire and stamped steel brackets found at Home Depot.The Knape & Vogt/John Sterling brackets will last a lifetime without fail. Proof that sometimes you don't have to spend more to get American made quality.
4,"Beware - Wonderful book, terrible format","This is a lovely book, which I imagine I will read again and that is why I ordered a copy for myself after reading a library copy. PLEASE BE AWARE that if you order the hardcover format from Amazon you will get a cheaply made edition with acidic, pulpy paper and a rigid cover - technically hardback but not nicely produced. It may be that the original hardcover of this is out of print, but in that case they need to be open about that."
2,Deep ploughing,"To me this book seemed very hard to get into, although the usual depth was there if I made the effort. But so hard that I have to admit I merely scanned quite a bit of it. Not one to start on if you're not used to Alan's writings."
5,West meets the Rest,Simply one of the best American Philosophers.I don't know why this isn't a book presented in most curricula.This should be an introduction book for any and all who are interested beyond jesus.
5,This is It!,"This collection of essays is Alan Watts at his best. I became interested in Zen while serving in Vietnam (1970), but was never sure of what it meant until 1977, when I read The Way of Zen, on the advice of a fellow traveller of Erhard Seminar Trainings (est).I beleive I became enlightened in the Zen sense through the est training. ""This is It"" was one of the catch phrases of est, and reading Alan's book evokes memories that used to be experiences."
1,Broke in the oven and made a mess!,"In the middle of a casserole, my wife smelled something burning in the oven. Looked inside and the casserole was leaking onto the oven floor. This dish had split into 3 pieces in the oven!! Stay away!"
1,Beautiful cracked dish,Cracked after 2 uses. I was very sad to see such a pretty dish end up in the garbage.
2,Pretty just not sturdy,This broke after only a couple of uses :( It was a pretty dish and I liked it. It just didn't last long.
5,Wonderful educational DVD,"I received this DVD as a gift from one of my day care mothers. I have many educational type DVD/videos to choose from, but when given a choice, the children in my day care choose this DVD over the others. They love the music and anticipate the changing scenes. clapping when their favorite ones appear. Highly recommended."
2,Not for a 2 or 3 year old,"Very surprised to see so many high ratings for this video. The video says for 3-36 month olds. I would say 3-12 month olds is more appropriate. Additionally, I don't see much difference between this video and the Baby Einstein collection. A little more focus on vocabulary, but still a lot of distracting images. If your child is having speech delays, based on other peoples reviews I guess its worth forking over the $19.99 to see if it is of some help. Otherwise don't bother."
2,Disappointed,"After reading all the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this product, I went ahead and purchased this DVD. Another factor that convinced me to try the product was the fact that a speech/language pathologist was involved in its production. I agree with Daddy T, that Baby Society is practically identical to the Baby Einstein DVDs. My 13-month-old babies were totally bored with it. What HAS piqued their interest and spurred language growth are the Baby Signing Time DVDs. I highly recommend those instead by a hundred fold!Speech Pathologist Twin Mom"
1,waste of time,"This jar opener does not do what it says it does - which is opening jars. The steel teeth do not grip - instead they slip.I went back to using my ...plastic daisy, the ugly duckling of jar openers, but one, nevertheless, that works."
1,Not what it says,I sent it back once and then they sent me the very same thing again. Under the description it says that a wood pole and bracket are included but they are not.
2,Very Limited,"Some of the commands and navigation feaatures I assumed would be available weren't. You could not program a phrase to execute a macro, you need the full L&H version for that. I found it easier just to click and type than spell out my password and tell the computer how to navigate etc."
4,HardcoreLover,"This is a great, little known(at least in America) band. Ive heard them compared to the Refused, and some similarity is there. And, no, it is not a popular pop-punk band like Sum41, Blink-182, or Paramore. I admit, those bands have their strengths, but the maturity and slightly more hardcore sound of the Disco Ensemble is what sets them apart. I would highly recommend this album, if not for all the songs on it, but the few select ones that blew me away. Its also proof that we, in our sometimes closed-minded musical brains, can sometimes forget the great euro bands out there. They deserve to be remembered! By this CD, youll enjoy it."
4,Awesome.,"Ok, I'm not a kid. I can't be bothered to sign up.But indeed, this is a great album. NOTHING like Blink, Sum41, all those other pop punk bands. Infact, The Disco Ensemble isn't quite like any other band... Great guitars, vocals, and their own unique style make this an awesome CD. Favourites are We Might Fall Apart and Drop Dead Cassanova.It's not ABSOLUTELY amazing, but solid, well written, slightly heavy, and even catchy at times. I reccommend it."
4,Great arch support,"These sandals have the best arch support I've ever had in sandals. I have flat feet and overpronate, and these were great. The downside is that it took me a while to figure out how to alter those straps (they seem to all be interconnected), but once that was altered to fit me, it was fine after that."
3,"Cute, but toe strap STRANGLES your big toe!!","I have the same complaint with these many other people do: the toe strap just continuously clamps down on my big toe, so tight I feel like my toe is losing circulation! I previously owned the original, single strap, non-toe strapped, Z-1. I loved those, so decided to buy the ZX2 for their ""cute"" factor. Big mistake, should have stuck with my original or bought the single strap zx1. I have to stop and adjust these sandals every 20 minutes, all day, any time I wear them."
1,tighten as you walk,"These sandals, which have good arch support which is why I bought them, tighten as you walk to the point that after about 1/2 hour you will have deep strap lines etched into your feet. Too bad."
5,Comfy Sandels,"I have a high arch and wear inserts in shoes. With Chaco sandals I don't have to worry, the arch is there. Love'em!"
3,"Complicated, but cute.","I love the way these look once I get them on, but that can take forever! The whole thing is just one strap, so each time you adjust in one place you have to adjust in another, and there's no telling whether or not it will stay put; it just may adjust itself mid-stride to strangle some part of your foot, especially your big toe."
5,Awesome,"I love these shoes so much I'm not sure what I'm going to do when it is too cold out to wear them. They fit like a glove. Great arch support, great stability, great fit and I get compliments are their appearance every time I wear them. Cute and functional...what more could a girl ask for?"
5,Chaco's!!!,"These shoes are soooooo comfortable! I received these in less than 48 hours. The color is very nice, very casual, and they go with most of my summer clothes! Great for hiking and fishing! Great shoes!"
4,love love love,"I went backpacking in SE Asia for 2 months with these on most of the time. These are so comfortable because of the durable sole. I can walk in rural area (farming) to metropolis like Bangkok, that how versatile these is. There is one flaw to this tho, it does have the sweat smell after you wear them for a while. I have to wash them every now and then."
1,Book rejected by time,Writer is a complete believer of for profit companies save the healthcare industry. But the examples she gave as the future of healthcare mostly bankrupt or having great legal problems now... such as PhyCor and HealthSouth... So the revolution of Nashville went bust... Book believes consolidation will save healthcare but we had this experience with big conglomerates in 70s... I am saying book does not provide any insight about healthcare... Writer had a pink dream with the abundance of capital in 90s... Now the heroes are dead with debt and fraud...
4,The Susan Jaffe segment,"Susan Jaffe speaks to Charlie Rose about her career in ballet just as she is about to give her final performance. She will dance in Giselle at the American Ballet Theatre. She tells of her being selected by Misha Baryshnikov as an eighteen - year old to dance her first major role. She speaks of her career in ballet, and how it has been different from the wholly bright world she once imagined. She speaks about Ballet entering in a new phase in which fierce competitiveness between artists is less the rule than it was before. There is something pleasant and winning in her manner.I occasionally watch segments of shows on subjects I know nothing whatsoever about. This was one of them. I imagine those who know the world of ballet and care for it will find this segment illuminating."
2,"For once, Harnoncourt loses his Czech touch","Those who are familiar with Harnoncourt's stunningly simple yet powerful Dvorak recordings will be deeply disappointed here. In the Dvorak triptych, Harnoncourt masterfully outlines the big tunes with plain tone colour, adopting fairly conventional tempi and resulting in extremely coherent performances. Not so here. His languid tempi (you will not be able to find any other recording which needs to spill onto a second disc) so often make each tone poem lose its structural shape, and his harping on individual melodies make things sound rather fragmentary. It is worth hearing for its entertainment and intellectual value, and it challenges your perception and conception of the piece, but not very convincingly to my ears."
4,Nephilim est de retour,"McCoy ne peut pas cacher n'influence qu'a eu NeFilim sur son style personnel : il crie fort, aboie, erructe... Loin de l'excellent album éponyme, NePHilim revient avec quelque chose de résolument moins industriel et de beaucoup plus mélodieux. Mon coup de coeur va a Hollow Doll - sans doute la plus gothique de toutes. Je conseille de l'écouter au moins trois fois avant d'en faire une critique objective ! Pascal."
1,Fields are dead...,"I am so dissapointed about this new so called ""Fields of the Nephilim"" album. It's just another Nefilim, strange with bombastic metal guitars and double bass in every parts and songs. Not very melodic.... no no, Fields of the Nephilim are dead :-("
4,FALLEN - FIELDS OF THE NEPHILIM,"I'll try to keep this short.This classic gothic band is my favorite of all time and their new release ""FALLEN"" further reinforces why they are #1 in my book.""FALLEN"" continues in a dark and somewhat heavy fashion where only two original members remain and some of their previous members also contributed to this output. Hence, you will notice more programmed sampling instead of actual musicianship but personally, I am happy that I was able to add this disc to my collection.It sounds like CARL McCOY is continuing in the direction from his ""ZOON"" album which I agree is very underrated.I just love this guy and I hope to hear more material from him within the next five years."
1,WAIT FOR THAT WHICH IS COMING,LEAVE THIS ALBUM ON THE SHELF. IT IS STATED BY CARL MCCOY THAT HE DOES NOT ENDORSE THIS RELEASE AND ONE CAN HEAR WHY. IT IS INCOMPLETE AND DOES NOT FIT IN WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE NEPHILIM FROM WHICH ZOON DIFFERS FROM ELIZIUM AND SO ON DOWN THE LINE. THIS RELEASE IS ONLY OF USE IF YOU MANAGE TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE LTD EDITION VERSION WHICH FEATURES A BONUS DISC OF LIVE SONGS FROM THE FOREVER REMAIN VHS RELEASE. IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS BAND YOUR FIRST PURCHASE SHOULD BE ELIZIUM. BUY IT AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING SINCE IT WAS RELEASED IN 1991 AND THEN ENJOY THE NEPHILIM JOURNEY FOR YOURSELF.
2,I could not tollerate the smell either,I have no idea how is works because the smell like others have commented was just too much . It makes me gag just to think about it. I wish there was some other alternative I could find to this but I just dont know what to say. I had to put the bottle outside the house it was so bad.
1,Very Strong Smell,"This product may be effective, but I will never know since the smell was too overpowering. My whole cabinet and kitchen had a foul odor like spoiled milk. Even after putting the container in 2 sealed ziplocks, it still stunk up the cabinet. I couldn't stomach the smell enough to try it and ended up throwing it away. Very disappointed."
5,A Great Guide to Sydney,"A wonderful deluxe edition just in time for the Olympics. This guide provides up-to-the-minute details that are essential for Olympic and other travellers. Much reconstruction has been going on in Sydney, and older guides (even from last year) can be terribly inaccurate. This guide comes in a handy travel case which makes for easy reading on the go. I highly recommend it!"
1,older than my granddaughter,"nowhere in the advertising did it say how old this travel guide was, i believe it was over 10 years old, how disappointing."
5,Used it for Years,This is the best plumper I have ever used. I try each one that comes on the market and always return to Freeze 24/7 PlumpLips. The only one that works as well is not easy to find (because Glow Minerals is not sold in stores). This is a consistently good product and all colors work just as well.
3,Lip gloss,"This is a good lip gloss, plump lips?? I did not notice a change. I received it very fast,still a nice color--good for a gloss."
2,Only good for central London,"Only good for central london. It is a small and basic map with a London guide (let's goes guide) binded in between. I guess it's good for tourists for the week, but not for me b/c i will be living outside central (just downtown) london."
3,Low Salt Cookbook,This cookbook has a good variety of recipes for all meals. I liked the recipes for homemade spice blends. The recipes included brand name products which are not available in the Northwest. The recipes are easy to follow and it is an overall good low salt cookbook.
1,Everything Low-Salt Cookbook,Uses too many brand names that are very hard to find or very expensive. Some of the recipies I have used are not at all good.
3,Well -- there is a little pain...,"I am a parent of a reluctant rising 7th grader. I decided that my son and I would read this book together to help him with his reluctance and to help him increase his reading comprehension. However, the 1st sample reading selection was an English/Social Studies selection about a Holocaust survivor. I felt a bit of pain in the 2nd chapter when I had to answer my son's question -- ""What is rape ?"" after he read the sentence -- ""Each and every one returned at midnight screaming with terror and pain because each one had been raped.""I have not given up on the book - because already I think there are some great points for helping with reading comprehension -- but I really wasn't ready for the comprehension to be about really difficult issues. So this is just a warning for other parents to be aware of."
3,Software Does Not Work,"It seems to be working fine protecting my gear, but how would I know? It does not come with, and they don't have and free, software that works with Windows 2000."
1,Waste of Money,"Steer clear of this one. Several (but not all) of the songs are not the original recordings (or the ones you are familiar with)and are Karaoke style re-sings by the artists. Joe Cocker's ""You are so Beautiful"" - which he ATTEMPTS to re-sing but fails MISERABLY is probabaly the lowest point of this already bad compilation. After one play, this CD has been placed in my ""to be thrown or given away"" bin."
1,Bad!,"I feel wrong even giving it one star -but had no other choice.This is an awful CD. Where did they find some of these songs?Plus, most are bad recordings and sound off. Fast forwarded through a lot of it.I think I will just throw it away!"
3,The Australian Rocky and Bullwinkle,"I'm too young to remember this show when it originally aired in the mid 1960's. I came to it mainly out of interest in Air Programs International (API) the Australian production company that created the cartoon, but then later went on to make a number of animated TV specials throughout the 70's.This show bears little relationship to their later work, but it is certainly entertaining enough, and is close indeed to Rocky and Bullwinkle. The animation and the quirky humor will remind you of that show--except that it is set in Camelot. It's more like the ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" segment of Bullwinkle. Very absurd--almost Dada.It's not bad--a bit derivative, but not bad."
2,Pretty Vacant,"Ever wonder how the top-ranked reviewers force their way to the top?They vote for their own reviews over and over.So brilliant. So clever. But not ""well-done""!Talk about the triumph of noise over signal, chaos over order, and quantity over quality!"
5,Best workout video.,"I like this workout video because the most important thing to me in any workout is that I sweat, work my heart and lungs, and knowing I have made changes to my body condition. I have noticed all 3 things with this workout. I sweat so much I need a shower and change my clothes. Unfortinately that doesn't happen often for me but it does with this video. I have gone down 2 pant sizes so far. I seem to be able to workout longer now that I am working with ""Killer Abs and Back"". I would deffinately recommend this video if you want to sweat."
5,The best abs DVD ever,"I workout everyday going from yoga to pilates and everything in between, needless to say that I have a lot of DVD but so far this is the best abs DVD I have yes!! finally somebody smart, nice who came up with a great workout. This is perfect not too short or too long just perfect. I has different exercises that I have ever seen before and trust me you will be sore in a good way that is. I hate doing floor work but this one has just enough of mat work that you don't get bored on the contraty you are so busy that time flyes by. Don't miss this one it is great!!"
1,really bad if you like organized instructors,"This workout dvd is quite bad. Almost immediately, I realized how this man CANNOT keep count, and just rambles on and on while his 'assistants' are doing the exercises (as in, he's 'training' them, hence the title). The problem with not counting but rambling on is that the workout becomes uneven--more reps on the one side over the other. I mean, counting is pretty pedestrian when it comes to workouts, isn't it? How else do you measure your improvements? Furthermore, the workout lacks the minutest level of creativity--it's just boring, repetitive, basic movements (as is the workout with Dolores) and you're not even sure what bart of your abs some of these movements are working exactly. I'm not sure Michael knows the exact details either. No doubt he's ripped and whatever he's doing for his own body is working (I read somewhere he's a boxer), but as an instructor, I think my pizza delivery guy could pull off something more interesting and worth my time."
2,lacking alot of video direction,"seems like this video could be useful, but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it, yet alone trying to work out to it....some of the moves were cool, but all in all i will trade this in for something else."
2,Soulmate,This book was terrible did not help in this day and time maybe if would have bought 10 years ago but the things told to do to find a soulmate was not how it is done.
1,Does not work!,"I am in the process of returning the Pine D'Music MP3 player to amazon. When I received the MP3 player in the mail I was so excited. But looks can be deceiving. It did not work with Windows 95 or 98, although it said it would. I tried it on 4 other computers to ensure it wasn't just my computer. After a week of trying and even getting my friend who is a Computer Science Major to try, I gave up. I do not recommend this product unless you are up for a major headache. It's compact size and light weight is the only thing it has going for it."
4,Lots o' Bang for the Buck!,"Notice how half of the bad reviews are from people who have never even used this unit? The others are from people that didn't read the manual and set their printer port to ECP mode. As long as you don't use MP3s with bitrates other than 128kbps, this is a fantastic player. Yes, it will play MP3s with bitrates lower than 128k, but you may have to put up with some odd display behavior at best and you may have to reinstall the download software at worst. It is small, light, runs forever on 2 AA batteries, has a great voice record feature, SmartMedia expansion slot, A-B looping (great for figuring out that guitar riff), a nice EQ, and it's cheap (relatively). It would be nice if it used USB (but at least it doesn't use serial), but the parallel port isn't *that* slow. D-Link sells this player under the name DMP-100."
3,problems with the batteries,this is an average player with some good features. the problem is that at first it worked only with toshiba alcalyne batteries. after i put some paper in the battery slot it began working with all types of normal batteries but it still couldn't work with rechargeables. a friend of mine had to mount a small piece of copper to the battery lid. now it works about 3 hours with 250mAh Varta Rechargeables.
1,THIS IS THE WORST PLAYER ON THE MARKET!,"OK SO I GET AND OPEN THIS DMUSIC MP3 PLAYER AND I PLUG IT IN AND INSTALL THE SOFTWARE I NEED TO DOWNLOAD SONGS ONTO THIS SMALL PLAYER... I TRY TO TRANSFER AND IT KEEPS SAYING"" CANNOT COMMUNICATE TO PLAYER"" CONSTANTLY, AND I HAD TO SHUT OFF MY COMPUTER CAUSE THE PROGRAM FREEZED IT! PLEASE TAKE PROCAUTION WHEN YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT! HORRIBLE!"
2,useful but...,"The case is plastic and has many openings that are unprotected, so it is not usable around moisture. Beware of the manufacturer's claim that it can record up to 4 hours of voice (only if you buy the extra 32M memory upgrade) the basic unit is limited to 2 hours maximum."
5,Classical Music Experience!,"I have to say, that this Pine MP3 player is the beast of all players! Dont give me any of this Diamond Rio rubbish, the Pine SM320v is the king. I found the music to be clear and crisp, and with such ease to download. I highly recomend this player to anyone who interested in purchasing one. Take my word for it this player is the ultimate beast!"
1,BEWARE!,"Please BEWARE when considering the Pine Technology SM-320V D'music MP3 player. The first one that I received would not turn on at all, even with fresh batteries. I received a replacement from AMAZON in a timely fashion (thanks, Amazon!). However, while the replacement unit would turn on, it would not turn off! Please consider carefully before purchasing this unit."
1,Dont buy an mp3 player!,"If you are rich as hell, go ahead and buy it. But for the price your paying for this, you could get a great Mini Disk player, and even plenty of discs for over 2,000 minutes of recording time. Dont believe me? Goto the Mini Disc section and do the math! Even better, you can record mp3's onto the MiniDisk players, you can also record your voice, your playstation/N64/Dreamcast, VCR, TV, Radio, Tape, everything! I almost bought an mp3 player, and im glad i didn't. MP3's are too expensive compared to Mini-Disks, and if you look at the Mini Disk trend right now, its exactly like the CD trend 10 years ago. They are already making Mini Disk drives fro computers to store info. Just check out the Mini Disks before you buy this, trust me, you'll thank me. If you have any questions, email me, Ill answer them asap!"
3,The best player............and the worst.,"I've read all 20 reveiws on this Mp3 player. Half claim it stinks and to get the Diamond Rio. The other half say that it's the best player around and that the Diamond stinks. I'm tempted to get a mini-disc because I've heard so much about how great they are. Then I read another reveiw and it says to buy a Mp3 player, not a mini-disc. Can someone that has bought or know someone who has bought this product or one like it give me a straight answer. I'd appreciate someone telling what the real deal about these things are, it's ups, it's downs. Thanks"
4,?,"How can half of the people that have this love it, and the other half hate it? It just dont make sense...is it that people are putting it in the usb? not the parallel? I dont know i'd like some1 to tell this to me"
5,he's still got it,"Dywer has perfected his style over the years culminating in this masterpiece of irish fiction. He's been getting on a bit in recent years and even though he quiped jovially in his last interview 'I couldn't score in a brothel with my pants down' it's good to know he can still put pen to paper and the other hand on his little lad, mickey."
4,Good but wears to fast,This Product has amazing grip but it wears slightly more than my other gloves have but i dont regret buying them for 60 dollars
1,Filled with Errors,"Samuel Barber has been neglected in print (only one major biography and a whole lot else) so whenever a new book comes along, it's a welcome thing. Unfortunately any of the merits of this book are completely outweighed by the fact that the book is completely filled with errors. If you are a dilettante and are just looking for a breezy, easy read, it's fine for that. But for the more serious reader, interested in accuracy and real scholarship, this book should be avoided."
4,a fine band,"Three years ago I saw The Clientele play in Boston. There was nothing going on and I was tired of seeing another garage rock band. I was only slightly familiar with them. I was asked to review their first album. I didn't really know if they were from England or Ohio. They seemed like something like The Beatles and The Byrds. The guitarist had a distinct style of playing that was unique. Songs like ""My Own Face Inside The Trees"" are wonderful. There is a bookish and a sonic ability that is quite charming. I was into Louis Philippe a few years ago too. He arranged some of this album. That guy was really into lush productions of the 1960s. Stuff like Joe Meek and the Mamas and the Papas. Cornelius also explored this music. The Clientele seems to have created another brilliant record, that is its own world, and doesn't really care was is in fashion. They are a cool band."
5,"Dreamy, floating, beautiful.","I feel lucky to have discovered The Clientele, purely by chance, earlier this year. They manage to create the most fantastic, dreamy atmospheres, the lyrics are so hauntingly beautiful..This album is wonderful, and I've played it on repeat since I bought it.. My favorites are ""K"" and ""Since K got over me"".Looking forward to Sunday, I'm going to see them live!"
2,Monotonous,"This band came to my attention with the song ""(I Can't Seem To) Make You Mine"" as featured at the beginning of ""The Lake House."" I found the song to be lovely and haunting and I couldn't get it out of my head the night after my wife and I rented the movie. So I hunted down a sample of the album (on another website) to see what the rest of their material sounded like. At first, I found the music enchanting and ethereal. But, by the time I finished listening to the rest of the relatively short samples, I felt a strong desire to hear something else. All of the songs bear the same tempo and textures. Furthermore, the guitarist appears to never turn the tremolo effect on his amp off. This is the type of audio effect where a little goes a long way, so I'm going to skip this one, thanks! I still like ""Make You Mine,"" so I bought the soundtrack instead."
5,The Best Windham Hill Collaboration EVER,"I had this on vinyl, and it was my favorite compilation from the early Windham Hill musicians. For George Winston fans, he does some of his best work here, accompanied by some equally great musicians (I can't remember who all is on this disk since I have been missing it for so long, nor the name of the tracks).I have been lookng for the CD forever in shops and online stores for years and years (for some reason hadn't checked here). Therefore, I was't surprised by the price, because I know how impossible it is to find, and I know how great it is. It is worth the money, if you have any appreciation for these artists, because it ranks among the best any of them have done solo, and is one of the best instrumental soundtracks ever. The movie was pretty good too... it came with a crop of other farm movies around the same time."
2,"Great design, looks sturdy, but handle is loose in first month!","Oh, pooh, and I only used about 20 times. It felt so nice and made the job easy, but now it wobbles. Drat!"
5,Absolutely beautiful!!,"This album is absolutely beautiful!!! The picture doesn't do it justice. We bought this album for our son and daughter-in-law to put their pictures in from their anniversary trip to Hawaii. Our daughter-in-law was impressed by the handmade areas to place the pictures. It is done so very, very nicely. I would highly recommend this album and would purchase this item again without hesitation."
5,Absolutely Beautiful and Unique,These 3 photo albums are absolutely gorgeous and unique. They arrived just in time for Christmas too. I love them so much I just ordered 3 more (which I hope also arrive just in time for Christmas)! I'll be ordering more in the future too. I'm sure everyone I've bought one for or am buying one for will love them just as much as myself.
5,Perfect decorative box,All Natural Handmade Wood Decorative Box - ElephantPerfect for elephant lovers! Sender was very timely!
4,Very Original !,"This is the second time I've purchased this photo album. It's perfect for my Hawaiian pictures. The green color of the palm and the outer edge will fade in time to a brownish color. But, still looks okay."
3,Not his best.,"It was good when it came out, but at the moment I can only listen to a couple of songs on this one. I had resold this CD in the past and bought it again recently, and now I can remember why I got rid of it.His music has progressed for the *better* since this came out and here's why. Jim is a very gifted and melodic writer, and his melodies have a difficult time surfacing in a ""one man band"" setting such as solo piano.Not only that, when he has other musicians supporting him it frees him up to really express himself on the piano through the chords and structure of the songs, as well as the melody whenever that allows for it. To play like a real musician. It's all Jim's music anyways regardless of who is helping him execute it.So I say let the caged bird(s) sing."
5,THIS IS ONE OF JOE MAC'S BEST,"ok i met the man and lemme tell ya this is his best album by far! no joke!!! the language is typical of joe but man oh man i love the album. I play it over and over again. Great job Joseph!! A masterpiece in my opinion. His vocal abilities are amazing and i enjoy this album. If you get past the obscene language, then you're enjoy this album 100%!!! i guarantee!!! get this for any joe mac fan and i recommend getting it for christmas!!! very nice christmas gift!!!! his instrumental abilities and his song writing are incredible!!!!!i am a true joe mac fan and he will always be number one in my heart!!!!Love ya joey!!!"
1,Mega disappointed,I love Joe but this CD was terrible. I would definately not reccommend it to anyone. The main thing I objected to is the use of the Lord's name in vain in at least 3 songs. This was not neccessary.
3,Short-changed!,Love the product but my container was not even half full! Very disappointed. It was not a terribly expensive item but did expect to get full amount!
4,Nice recurrent bike,This a very nice and sturdy bike. Took 2 house to put together. All parts fit perfectly. Only wished that that arm pedaling would also work in reverse.
2,Frustrated,"Having Multiple Scelrois,bike was purchased for the hand pedals to help legs go around. After assembly by friend,discovered the hand pedals are not attached to the leg pedals and also have no way to set any tension for them. After talking with Stamina customer service I had friend disassemble and package bike back up and returned. Hence very frustrated."
3,box arrived crushed after drop by UPS,"Don't know anything about this item-as it arrived with the end CRUSHED due to drop or poor treatment by UPS.It was returned, paid for by Amazon. I hope Amazon charged UPS and got credit.We've given up on UPS, as this was the 6th item ruined by them in about 2 years.They are rude, impatient and inconsiderate drivers who don't even ring yourdoor bell to alert you it has arrived. About a month ago, we had a credit cardreplacement that they slipped under the door mat and it laid there for 3 daysbecause they didn't have the courtesy to ring the door bell and we WERE home.If you should complaint to them, you will learn very quickly that no one at UPScares one way or the other."
3,Love this bike but it broke after almost 3 years,"I paid $530.00 for it ... a deal when considering it's listed at $800-$1000+ elsewhere. Still after almost three years of almost daily use, the metal part under the seat that holds it to the base cracked and now the seat tilts back to far, makes a loud grating noise, and is unusable. If this bike were only a couple hundred dollars, I would say I got my money's worth. I just think that anything this expensive should last at least the 5 years it's waranteed for. I'm checking to see if I can get the part replaced, at least."
4,RECUMBENT BIKE,"GREAT BIKE, EXCEPT I WISH IT HAD ARM RESTS, IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO USE THE ARMS AND LEGS SEPARTELY. ALSO, MY DAUGHTER IS HANDICAPPED AND NEEDS THE SIDE SUPPORT.THE COMPANY COULD EASILY MAKE AN EXTRA ATTACHMENT TO SUBSTITUTE WHERE THE LOWER HANDLES ATTACH."
3,Stamina Elite Bike,"I like the bike, it is good equipment,especially as an arms bike,which is what I was looking for. Unfortunately the supplier failed on basic packaging. The somewhat flimsy plastic meter box, preinstalled just above the 2 rotating handles, came in cracked. I patched it somehow, something I shouldn't have to do after paying $800."
4,Nice for the price,"Arrived promptly. Meter didn't work, but with one call was promptly replaced. Seat shifts a little while riding, otherwise nice bike."
4,BIKE,DIDN'T TAKE TOO LONG TO PUT TOGETHER. MY 15 YEAR OLD WAS ABLE TO DO IT ALONE. HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE SEAT EXACTLY THE RIGHT DISTANCE. I DO ENJOY RIDING IT
3,Could be better.,"Overall this camera does it's job. The picture quality is impressive, but the red eye reduction is fairly weak. In order for you to take a good picture, you have capture your picture in the frame, then hold the button half way down so the camera has a chance to focus, and then push the button all the way down to snap the picture. This doesn't seem very painful, but if you're anything like me you don't really have the time to pay that much attention when your snapping picts. If you're looking to spend $100 on a camera I would recommend going for a Cannon ELPH or a Nikon of some sort. Samsung makes great cell phones though!"
4,Great little camera!!,"It's compact, durable, simple to operate, and takes great pictures! Have had absolutely no problems with the camera for the 3 years I've owned it!!"
4,Great little camera!,"This is a very small camera in size, but LARGE in capability. I consistently get sharp mages with this camera. It is quiet and very unobtrusive. The zoom is smooth and the flash has plenty of power when used with 200 or 400 film. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a camera to carry with them all the time."
2,Snow Job,"This book consists of page after page of descriptive phrases with no full sentences or actions. After I read this book to my 3 and 5 year old sons, I really wondered how it got published. It's pretty boring and employs words that are much too lofty for the preschool set. The pictures, however, are lovely."
5,Things forgotten,I love watching night court its a classic i am so glad that they put it on dvd i cant wait untill they put the rest on video to...
4,court's in session,"I just bought the first season(unforunatly not from Amazon)and the reviewer who said that first is alittle rougharound the edges is correct. Most shows in first season are. TheNight Court we all came to love came alot later;however itis interesting to note that after a rough start, it did indeed improve coming unfortunately with the loss of Ms. Diamond and Ms. Halop. It took awhile for them to get into stride and they did. For those new to Night Court, give it time to grow on you. It's gets better and better."
4,Night Court (Great TV),"This is classic TV. Probably one of the top 5 TV shows of all time. This first season isn't the best of the series but it is still funny TV. I can't wait to get the second season and beyond. Non-stop humor, my kind of TV.Hippie"
3,Wonderful - but short,"Night Court is hilarious, but I was surprised to find only 13 episodes in the first season."
4,The original Must See TV,"Back in the early-to-mid 80's, NBC OWNED Thursday nights with a killer sitcom lineup: The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Cheers and Night Court. And while history will probably ultimately judge Night Court as the least acclaimed of the four, I think it's still the funniest. And you can see the other 3 on TV Land or Nick At Nite...I don't remember the last time I saw Night Court in syndication.And it's true, the first season was a little rough (hence 4 stars instead of 5). But the brilliant John Larroquette is reason enough for me to own all seasons of this show. I hope someday his own John Larroquette Show will get a DVD release.I hope fans will scoop this first season up, so we can get on with the later (and better) seasons."
5,One of the Funniest Shows On TV Ever,"This was one of the funniest shows to grace our screen. Admittedly, the cast changed as the show progressed in later years but the quality of the comedy was always evident in the writing and direction."
5,Memory lane,"Can only be biased. I used to watch this when I was at Universty and I loved it ( like Cheers and the early Simpson's ) . Used to love John Laroquette, still do. I am sure you will love it too if you watched this show in the mid 80's."
5,night court,"I have cable but never see this show on tv, Nice to watch shows that were funny with no foul language being used."
4,Good device but the other reviews are right,"If you buy one of these keep two things in mind. 1. You can't put too much pressure on the grips when opening a jar or the rivet will break (it is obviously flimsy). Grasp just hard enough to seat the jaws on the lid then begin turning. For me it has worked fine through months of use. 2. When seating the jaws on the lid, I've found it helps to press down on the top of the jaws while you start squeezing on the handles until the teeth of the jaws grip the edge of the lid."
3,Not a lot of blasting going on,"Length:: 0:52 MinsAlthough this is a cute little bomb, it's kind of on the small side, and far too quiet for a boisterous kiddie party. As a matter of fact, if you can hear it go off, it means that your party really isn't going very well and everybody's sound asleep.It has a couple of things going for it, in that it's durable and has a sweet vibration effect (I noticed adults playing with it for suspiciously long periods of time), but if you're using it for a party game, you'll need to have your on/off music for back-up.Good for a prop, but as a bomb it's a fizzle.Amanda Richards, March 2, 2008"
3,not a party game,"I ignored the reviews and bought this for my son's pirate birthday party. We played it as a family before the party and had fun but it was a dud at the party. With the noise from about a dozen kids you cannot hear the ""explosion"". Cute idea but should be louder."
3,Arr! Hot Potato fun!,"Exactly what you think it is, it is. Fun little kids toy for tossing back and forth or passing round the table after dinner or passing the time with a giggle in the back of the car with one's brother and a cousin. Works well as an addition to the booty of the young pirate enthusiast who already has ample scabbards, eyepatches and treasure maps. Actually lobbing this as a bomb across the yard might break it, though. Be sure to insist the loser properly ""dies"" with appropriate dramatic flair. Imagination is really the more important aspect of this toy."
3,At least toss in a few more phrases for the comedy value,"It was a cheap toy, I bought several to get the free shipping planning to sell the other two...very cute idea, very poor implementation, unlike hot potato you can't vary the timer it's all internal. I have to agree the volume is a bit low, I bought this to play with the adult pirate crew but it doesn't even have a variety of funny comments to keep it amusing...now if I could figure out how to reprogram the chip and make it say more and much more adult commentary......... They need to rerelease the toy make it say more, make the time much more variable and come out with an adult version. Good idea but it flopped, may be sending the other two back haven't decided yet."
3,ok,"My 5 year old son really likes the idea of this game, but I can hardly tell when it is exploding. It kind of vibrates. If your kids like pirate stuff, they will still probably like it. Seems to be well made. It does makes noise as the fuse is going down and has a few phrases. Overall, not bad, just a little lacking in explosions."
1,"Do not buy- OLD goods- leather cracks, glow doesn't work.","I purchased this 9 months ago. It has had 6 months of daily wear. I purchased this watch to replace my other Swiss Army watch of the same make and model. The glow worked for only about 3 minutes after being under direct light. Don't expect the glow to last longer than those three minutes. I kept the watch as I figured I could live without the lit decals. My previous watch lasted for about 5-7 years. The leather band on this one is already cracking and and breaking (after only 6 months of wear)- an indication that it is really old leather. It looks great out of the box, but it won't last. I'm sorry that I wasted 93.00 on it. I will not buy from this vendor again."
5,An albumn to pass the day away to...........,The easiest listening albumn I have ever owned. Close your eyes and it conjures up the happiest of thoughts. It is full and lush. An albumn everyone should have.
2,pitiful,"After getting this product, it had many problems such as turning off at the wrong times and then not coming back on for a long time. The cord was so short and flimsy it snapped."
5,GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN: THIS IS GREAT!,"Golllllleeeeeeee! Jim Nabors -- yes that Nabors, whose solid baritone has always been overshadowed by his Gomer Pyle hi-jinx -- recorded these tunes on two separate albums (in 1967 and 1972), both of which have long been underground classics. Legacy had (finally!) released this compilation ... just try and find a better rendition of ""Go Tell It On the Mountain."" (Sorry, Mahalia.) Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. And he sometimes really does fulfill our wishes."
4,Great,"All in all this is a great product, I had it put together in under two hours. It works well and offers a little bit of variety to your workout. Also, it folds enabling the unit to be pushed into a corner or against a wall for a more compact storage when not in use. Simple to use in every manner and great fun for those who enjoy biking or rowing."
3,"Great bike, but...","Great workout machine. The seated bike, pedals, magnetic wheel, etc and the rowing apparatus are fantastic. The control panel is crappy, though. The one that shipped with the bike didn't last 6 months and the second was supplied by the manufacturer for free, but lasted only another 8 months. The bike still works great, so it's good that it's mechanical and not electronic, b/c the electronic components didn't last. Still would like to measure my workouts..."
3,Better than average; I expected better computer and foot guard,"I tried a few other rowing machine before this purchase. I rate this rowing machine as barely average, rowing machine alone 6 out of 10 because I like the seating and overall study structure. Rowing handle could be longer.- The computer is cheap with no programing option or upgrade from manufacturer, I give this 4 out of 10- The rowing machine foot rest was made for someone with foot size-9 and not larger. The strap does not secure properly and some what uncomfortable. In summary the foot guard for rowing machine is 2 out of 10.I like the bike and rate it 8 out of 10. The seat is comfortable, again the foot guard is poor.- The foot strap/guard could be better, I rate this as 4 out of 10.Summary: I like it, for $499 this product is average. I hope the manufacturer looks to improve and offer interchangeable parts and computer."
2,Average Bike/Average Rower (not good at any one),"Opened and assembled the recumbent bike and rower yesterday. First of all the box came pretty beat-up. Aside from a few scuffs to the machine, there was a broken (albeit non essential) piece of plastic not important enough to send the whole thing back. Assembly was a jiff. But when we (my wife and I) got on to use it... well that is where we departed on our opinions. The wife like the bike and did OK on the rower. I found the pedals too small on the bike and the rower was just useless... maybe I am spoiled with top-end rower ergs. But it was a bit ""jerky"" on the catch with a thud and the reach is just too short for a person 5+ feet. I like to have a greater range for reach and pull than what this machine can provide. I have to gove the bike a 6 out of 10 and the rower a 2 our to 10. So if you are a big time rower... don't buy this machine.JP Saleeby, MDSharon Saleeby, RRT"
2,grammar,"Some of the word usage puzzled me, so I submitted it to an expert in the Spanish language. He said the grammar violates some rules."
5,Good Product,I saw these on Dr. Oz and wanted to get some lol! They arrived timely and I like them alot.
3,coffee table book,"A bit disappointed in the photos that were chosen for this book. I thought with National Geographic, how could you go wrong? Wellll..they were not the best of, let's just say. Fast shipping, was a Christmas gift."
1,Poor Quality,This book fell apart the first time I opened it. Exceptionally poor quality construction.
3,Book is very SMALL!,"While it is true the book's dimensions are listed, the book should have been listed in the description by Amazon as VERY SMALL - only 5"" x 5"". and these photos are more history, interesting but old. I thought I was getting a more recent/modern book of pictures."
2,Printed in China,"Photos are hazy and not sharp. I'm surprised that National Geographic has had these small book printed in China.The quality is so poor I wanted to cry because there is good photography in the book.There are other small books in this series I wouldn't bother with.Lens,Wide Angle,WorkDon't we have good printers in US? With shipping and all the problems involved in checking quality, it seems it would be less expensive to have them printed here in our country.I know have in Italy and UK, France.These books will end up being sold quite cheaply because they are cheaply made."
2,Not the One I Thought I Was Ordering!,"The version of this book I had seen and thought I was ordering was in a larger format. The cover on the one I received was the same as one I had seen at a friends, so I thought it would be the same book. It's not! It's my fault for not reading the description carefully enough to see that what I ordered was a 6"" by 6"" format. Just letting others know that there are obviously two versions of the same book."
4,They tell a story,"As expected with National Geographic and demanded, the quality and layout is excellant . The ageless photographs show a continuance of high standards and a typical depth of poignancy only reached by experience and a passion for what you believe in . Shown over and over again the photographers have captured moments in time that have not lost their feel regardless of the passing of time , your visual journey is one of a wide variety of scenes that do not fail to inspire and in that take you there transforming the picture into life for they surely do each tell a story. I enjoyed it now and I know I will again ."
2,Binding split,"Excellent photographs, however I am extremely disappointed that the binding could not support the weight of the book when open and has badly split and will fall apart."
4,BEAUTIFUL!!!,"This book is gorgeous! The images are amazing and the stories/articles are a wonderful accessory to the photography. AND, what a bargain!!!! It is hard back and HUGE...well worth the money."
5,Perfect,I don't know much about boating but I was relieved to see that these fit perfectly and do the job well.
2,Food Obsessed,The Greedy Python and The Very Hungry Caterpillar are my least favorite of the books Carle has illustrated. They are both food obsessed and give mixed messages about over-eating. A great Carle book is Have You Seen My Cat.
4,Good story with a lesson,"This was an interesting story. The greedy python keeps eating beyond what it can handle, and doesn't stop even when he is tempted by his own tail. He eats himself into nothing. A good simple lesson on being too greedy.My daughter likes the illustrations. It's not my favorite Carle book, but I think it's interesting enough that it would be a good addition to your child's library."
1,Not what I thought,This product was in worst condition than the one I wanted to replace. It came with book tape on the spine and pages where on the brink of falling out.
4,covers a wide variety of topics,"This series includes review of basic concepts required for success in language arts at each grade level. Concepts such as reading skills, writing skills, and critical thinking skills are introduced, practiced, and reviewed in each lesson. The program can lend itself to individualized study or mini-lessons (each lesson is about 1-3 pages) for the entire class. However, the program is not necessarily for remediation, so choose a grade level accordingly."
1,Waste of time - useless,"The seller was reliable and honest, but this is not a silencer, it does absolutely nothing for silencing and it was a waste. If you want a quieter exhaust buy a different muffler."
4,"No problems with PnP, but..","if you intend on using this as a manually configured modem: good luck. Maybe it's just me and the people I've asked for help from, but I've still not been able to get this modem to work in the jumpered mode. In the Plug-n-Play mode it works fine and configures itself. The manual is rather skimpy on non PnP configs which doesn't help much. With that said - it does work great and I fully expect I will get it working with manual config since I want to use it under LINUX - and to do that you have to have a modem like this, NOT a windows modem, the extra cost is worth the flexibility!"
2,Just how old is this modem???,I found this modem rather interesting. My jaw literally dropped when I looked at the large picture for this device. ISA Bus??? What on earth??? No new computer comes with an ISA bus anymore does it? Mine only has PCI slots and one AGP slot. For a product that uses old school technology and has a $95.00 price tag just doesn't make sense to me.
5,Superior portable dictionary. The finest I've read and used.,"A complete descriptive; supplied in description with anyonyms, synonyms and metaphor. Exacting and 'precise' interpretation in the most simplistic, modern, efficient capabilities of usage available. No short shrift definitions here. Mr. Williams (editor) goes the full 9-yards! Get one!"
2,The prose got in the way...,"I generally enjoy reading all sorts of fantasy the more different the characters and settings the happier I am. Unfortunately while trying to make a realistic setting for her characters, the only thing this author did was give me a headache from trying to discern just what was being said.I hope to find some other titles and see if it gets better, but for this, I pass..."
2,Not what I expected,I was a little disappointed in the book. Some parts are ok but not at all what I thought it would be.
5,"Witty, Clever, Helpful & True!","This book is a perfect how-to-guide to the dizzy world of gay dating. I thought I knew everything about the subject. I didn't. In fact, I didn't really even have a clue. This will be the perfect Christmas gift for my single friends and even some couples who have a thing or two to learn. Bravo!"
5,Can't help lovin' dat man...,"The first thing that attracted me to the book was the back cover. I was browsing in the book store and saw HHME face down. It was interesting to see two men arm and arm, so it was picked up and skimmed through. ""Husband Hunting"" is very specific as to what a guy should be looking for when he's out searching for that significant other. Price writes the book using humor(the first words of the book explain how with three sons, his mother would never have expected a son-in-law) and incorporating past experiences, both good and bad. HHME takes the single gay man by the hand and guides him step by step through the journey for ""Mr. Right"". Although I'm not ready to start looking for a life partner(18), I know that I will reread this book when the time arrives. This is the ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" for the modern gay man."
5,Good stuff.,"I'd purchased this and ""The Priciples"" at the same time. ""The Priciples"" is much smaller, so I read it first, and almost ran screaming back to heterosexuality in fear! (Seriously.) The other book is about trickery, deceipt, and stupidity. Husband Hunting Made Easy, on the other hand is intelligent, well written, sometimes amusing, and seems to be just good advice in general. I haven't found a husband yet, and not really looking too hard just yet, so I can't say HHME works, but it's a fun read with some good advice for the inexperienced gay dater."
1,"Sad, Bad, and not Glad (that I read this book)","This book is a pitifully shallow and degrading analysis of something that is so important to so many. A true disappointment. On the other hand, if you find yourself liking everything that everyone else likes - in other words, if you're a trite cliche - then this book might be for you. I mean, what kind of a serious author lists a reason for having a partner of, ""He'll tell you when you're clothes don't match"" or ""he'll instantly double your CD collection."" If anything, this book helped me understand why I have a hard time engaging in idle chatter about uninteresting nothingness. Maybe it really is them and not me."
5,My wife and I are in love...,"...with this ice cream spade. I gotta warn you though, it's not for the weak or the timid. But if you're serious ice cream lovers like we are, despise those ball scoopers and other cheap, almost useless excuses for an ice cream scoop, this is the ticket. Heavy, strong, sturdy, but stylish and comfortable, too, this may be the best 10 bucks we've spent this year. I'm thinking of how many lucky people will get an inexpensive but great Christmas gift this year."
4,"Good price, nicely made","Somehow buying such a patriotic item made in China would have seemed a bad idea. These items, US made, were just a little more expensive, but seemed very well made."
3,Works OK now.,"When I got it out of the box, It didn't work right off. I moved something and then it started working. I changed the battery on it and the same thing happened. While using it, I found that the on/off switch was the thing that would sometimes work and sometimes not. I worked the switch back and forth about 20 times and now it works great. I can play while everyone else is watching TV. The only thing I wish was that the guitar cord was shorter."
1,a piece of junk,"the 9 v battery wouldnt go in it's place, the little sockets were out of line. after hours of trying, i finally trashed it."
5,Provocative,"The great Argentine artist and his former band deliver great music for the heart and soul. Songs like ""Viernes 3 AM"", and ""Noche De Perros"" add that wonderful nostalgic feeling. Beautifully performed and arranged, a CD that should be in every Garcia`s music collection."
5,What a voice!!!,Absolutely fabulous! I love the songs.. esp lost in carolina! Any one lookin wont be dissappointed! I love your coice and your pretty sexy.. are you single?? lol
3,"Great on financials, Lacking on creativity.","I was amazed how informative this book is when it comes to getting the business started financially and how to devise a marketing plan, find employees and contractors, and build a readership. However, the book really gives no information on the creative aspect of the business, such as how to pick a layout scheme or weed out useless content. I feel more confident on the business side now, but am still lost as far as building the magazine itself."
5,A Rare Classic! Highly Informative!,"If you're looking for a book that covers every inch of the magazine publishing industry, look no more... This book has it all! It's filled with realistic information that will help get you started with your own magazine. From how to develop a successful publication in today's marketplace to dealing with subscriptions and obtaining advertising commitments to building circulation to internet publishing--this book covers everything... Alltogether, it's the book you need to help get you started!"
4,Very good book,This book has alot of useful information when it comes to setting a newletter or magazine business. Most of the information is geared towards setting up a magazine but it is helpful none the less. I would recommend this book to others.
5,Solid book,"Don't let the raw art of the cover deceive you: this is a very good book. It complements Samir Husni's Launch your Magazine, with solid information on the commercial side of a magazine: how to study your market before you launch that dream magazine, what circulation is (and how to target for your audience), how to estimate your fixed and variable publishing costs (and how to balance them with your estimated revenues so as to break-even and then make a profit), and lots of other details. There are a few obvious pieces of info, but I read it twice, and marvelled at the insights and expertise which Cheryl Woodard offers us for a bargain price. Now I guess I'll read it a third time."
5,Best Book I've Seen on the Topic,"Clear, concise and invaluable advice. It's the best book I've seen on this topic."
2,This books doesn't live up to its title,"I thought this book was very boring. After reading this book I had as many questions unanswered as I did when I started this book. I would not recommend this book it you need a lot of information, but it may be alittle helpful."
1,An album that looks like an afterthought ............,"This cd was an attempt by Windham Hill to introduce ""promising new talent"". Unfortunately most of that talent is not well recorded, but the tune from Philip Aaberg stands like a beacon.Lou Ann is not my favorite track by him, but it is illustrative of his highly original style. It is from the album ""High Plains"" which introduced me to him on FM radio courtesy of the lovely ""Montana Half-light"". Forget this patchy offering and buy that instead."
5,Outstanding,This is possibly the best collection of Piano tunes ever. The variety and selections are awesome. I've owned this for 10 years and have never tired of it. Listening will transform you to a place of peace. I love this one and you will too.
5,Windham Hill Records Piano Sampler,"I purchased this CD with some money my mom gave me when I was a kid ,in the late 1980s. This CD is one of my all time favorites.I highly recommend this CD, it is really has very beautiful compositions.I had a math teacher who brought a record from Windham Hill Records to our class, after I had purchased the CD. I was wrather surprised, since Windham Hill Records is not a widely known and popular record label.The Record Label produces some very interesting music, after listening to my teacher's Windham Hill record, I still think that this piano sampler has some of my favorite songs on this CD."
5,A great piano sampler album,"This is one of the top Windham Hill Sampler albums. There are not as many songs on it as one of my other favourite piano albums (""Romance"" by Narada) but the songs here make up for that in their quality. These songs are not as ethereal as ""Romance"" and lend themselves to deep thinking as well as strong listening. The techinque in the first song ""In Flight"" with the echoing piano keys show the eclectic nature of this CD and it is, along with its Guitar Sampler sister CD, a great example of instrumental music."
3,The Usual Quickie Bio of a Good Singer and Vibrant Performer,Essentially that title sums it up. The problem with most of these kinds of books is they cover every facet of the performer's life (and Jewel has had a more interesting one than most) but they are too close in time and too enthusiastic to be definitive on the career of someone who is clearly talented and articulate but has a long way to go to develop to the level of those whom we will remember a hundred years on. This is a source on a life in progress not anywhere near a final word and analysis.
1,This book rambles and dosen't even give all the correct info,"This book rambles and dosen't even give all the correct information. If you really want to know what Jewel's life was like wait until her autobiography comes out this summer called, ""Life Stories""."
5,It was great!,"I read this book a few days ago, and I really liked it. I wanted to know more about Jewel because I love how she sings and when I read this book I discovered a lot of things that I didn't know about her. I'm really sure you'll like it!"
3,Jewel's better than the book,This was a good book but was backed up in too much detail.The second chapter was hardly about her.It told about the countries from where her father and grandfather came from.
2,Not precisely a simple makeup system,"Some good features of this product are the high-quality brushes and a structured system, but honestly when I first saw Lauren Hutton's commercial I expected (as they say) that this product would really make a difference with normal makeup and that it would really look natural at any age... in reality I don't find it adequate for a young adult skin. I also found that some of the colors in the disc are not so necessary.On the other hand, and although I bought this product thinking on the simplicity of the ""few-steps"" system, its protocol is yet time consuming; you must learn to match each color with a part of your face, otherwise you will have to look daily at the instructions that come aside if you want to know how to use it."
2,mom,"my son got this last year for christmas. We have tried countless times to make a car, but we have never gotten one made yet. The cars are never complete no matter how many crayons we put in. The one time that we came close to getting a complete car it cracked and broke in two before we could get it out of the mold. I must say we have had a good time trying to get it to work correctly, but it would be alot more fun it we could actually get a car!!!"
1,Not Very Fun,This has to be one of the worst-ever presents we have purchased. We tried several times and we were never able to make a single car. It would be best to steer away from this item unless you want maximum disappointment.
2,"Sound bites and highlights, but not much depth.","For somebody who was not alive in JFK's time, this seemed like a great way to get a feel for the politics and history of the 1960s. This approach, though, gives only a few minutes, five at most, of each speech and so the listener gets a famous highlight, but no depth of experience. I am excited about the primary exposure, but much more content and length is necessary for this to be of much use to a serious fan of history or politics."
1,Rubbermaid sink mats not what they used to be,I've used the Rubbermaid sink mats for years & they were always durable & stain resistant. Over the last year or two every mat I buy stains almost instantly & I've had mats that started growing mold on the underside. I've contacted Rubbermaid several times complaining that whatever they've done to change these mats has made the quality very poor. All they do is send me coupons to buy more mats. They've also eliminated the color choices. All you have are white & bisque which show the stains even more or red. You don't even have the option of picking something with a color that might hide the stains.
1,Rubbermaid? I don't think so!!,"We had a rubbermaid mat in our sink for 10 years..food stains washed right out. We had to order a new one because it finally got torn. I'm doubful this is an authentic ""rubbermaid"" mat. Everything you put in the sink stains this piece of junk! I just chucked it in the garbage where it belongs!"
3,Rubbermaid Sink Mats,"These mats seem to stain much easier than the Rubbermaid mats I have bought in previous years, otherwise they are good."
1,rubbermaid sink mats = stains,"As other reviews of the sink mats mention, these things are horrible when it comes to staining!!! I've used Rubbermaid mats for 30 years +, and when they got stained, I would fill the sink with water, add a little bleach, and an hour or so later, all the stains were gone. My new mat stained in the first week I had it from tomato sauce. I tried bleach, soaking it overnight. The bleach didn't touch the stains. I've tried baking soda, automatic dishwashing detergent, and other household cleaners, NOTHING WORKS!!If your looking for a sink mat, keep looking and don't get the Rubbermaid brand."
1,Rubbermaid sink mats,"Recently Rubbermaid came out with the ENHANCED sink mat. This new product is terrible. First off, I don't need anti-bacterial mats in my sink. I clean them everyday. Secondly, whatever component makes them ""Anti-bacterial"" also makes them stain. Nothing, not even straight bleach, removes the stains. Please bring back the Basic Sink Mat. I have used them for years and never had a problem. You may be able to find them at a local hardware store as older stock. I couldn't, so I searched online and found them on E-bay for under $[...] plus shipping."
2,Rubbermaid???,"Did they go to China too, and then produce mediocre products!The flexibility of these mats is not anything like the ""original"" and weare trying to find alternates- - - so far no luck.Not happy."
4,works fine,received merchandise in time stated. these reflectors were purchased for placement on leather straps worn across the chest. work great for this purpose. have no complaints.
4,Fun,It's a fun pan. I've made muffins and cupcakes. I'm still trying to figure out exactly the right amount of batter to put in. I often have it pop up over the top. For muffins this is no problem. For cupcakes I just slice off the top so I have an even frosting surface. My kids think it's pretty cool. Cooking time seemed about the same to me as a regular pan. I will buy more.
4,Do Not Read the Editorial Review,"Do not read the above editiorial review if you want to fully appreciate this film, as it gives away the plot. Ed Harris plays an American spy, Gus Lang. He works for both the British and Germans during the period immediately before DDAY. He is sent to Paris where a young but brilliant American officer, one of a handful of allied soldiers who knows the actual DDay plans, has been captured and is being interrogated by the Germans. The Allies direct Lang to prevent the young American from talking. The Germans use Lang to try coercing the American to reveal the Allies DDay plans. The fun of this movie revolves around not knowing Gus Lang's real intentions. Add the fact that one of the German officers involved in the interogation is working for the Allies, but which one? This is a smart, well written script, with strong characters by a fine cast."
5,Pleased,"I bought this as a gift and have had no complaints on it. They said it came in good shape and worked just fine, overall I'm pleased."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to read War Trash - it had excellent reviews from an award-winning author. Many of the details about the Korean war are interesting, as is the continual struggle between Nationalists and Communists, and the protagonist's disinterest in politics - and tunnel vision on returning home. However, I found the novel lacking in a compelling personal story, and that really did it in for me. The protagonist is quick on his feet, but not likeable, insightful, or particularly interesting. Ha's prose is stilted and cliche-filled, and left me with the impression that it had been translated (poorly). It slowed me down significantly, and detracted from the story enough that I considered putting down the book early on several occasions. Even worse, I now regret that I didn't."
3,"a very tough 3, almost 4","Ha Jin deserves more than 3 stars. His ""Waiting"" is absolutely beautiful. But three stars is what I decide to give ""War Trash"", and that is because of the documentary type approach Jin adopts. Its not that the novel is not moving, it definitely is. But I feel novels like Sebastian Barry`s ""A Long Long Way"" are more emotionally powerful, and I think thats gots lots to do with the poetry of Barry`s story. Ha Jin`s novel reads like impeccably written history - which is wonderful for its own sake. But only at the very end do we get the type of ""this can't be happening"" feeling that hurts us in the gut (lots), and make fiction in war settings so powerful. I look forward very much to the next time Ha Jin gives us a treat of pure heart-felt fiction and less fictionalized history"
3,interesting but not engaging,"I liked that this novel took me to a different time and place, one which I knew little about. I loved the idea of seeing the struggle in Korea from a different point of view. Unfortunately, the characters, including the protagonist, did not come alive to me. There was also a sameness to many of the stories. Politics took precedence over people in this novel."
4,Realistic as a war memoir,"This 2004 novel by a professor born in China but now living in Boston is fiction, but reads like a memoir. It tells of a Chinese soldier sent to Korea in 1951 where he is captured after being wounded. He is restored to health by an American surgeon and spends the time till 1953 in POW camps run by Americans. There is some brutality suffered by POWs but they in turn are rebellious and always seeking to do harm to their captors. In most memoirs by POWs one sympathizes with the POW but often one is repelled by the Chinese Communists' behavior as they seek to bedevil their captors. There is real suspense as to what will happen to the central character, who wants to go home to his moher and girlfriend but fears what will happen to him in Communist China, where any one captured is looked on as disgraced. A carefully crafted book, reeking with apparent authenticity, and a gripping book to read."
3,"Beautiful, but not quality","This set is gorgeous, but honestly, you can't use it. All the pieces had paint that chipped off after a couple of meals. Even if you wash them by hand, they simply don't stand up to being utilized every day. It's such a shame, because the style and presentation of these dishes makes a beautiful table setting. I wish she would retain the basic concept, and go back to the drawing board for dinnerware that can last."
1,I didn't receive my order,I placed my order 2-2-10 and still have not received it. I am very upset about the whole experience.
4,Key Rig,"The SP-1 Piano module sounds very good and easy to use.The MS-2 Poly Synth is fun, sounds great and very easy to dial up a useful sound.The MB-3 is the icing on the cake here. This is an outstanding module that has the right sounds right out the box.The GM-4 module I haven't had much luck with.The MB-3 is worth the small investment if your looking for a module to replicate the old B-3 sound. This module alone makes this a nice value."
3,Misleading Photos,"I must agree with a previous reviewer that I was highly disappointed to open the box and not see the keyboard in the online ad. The keyboard in the ad is, I believe, the 49i keyboard which had a few more bells and whistles than the one in the box. I am normally 100% satisfied with Amazon, but on this occasion I'm about 65%. Big difference in what I was lead to believe I was getting. As far as the product goes, it works fine for what it is. The instructions are not easy to follow and the installation was problematic, however, it seems to be working fine now. Just wish I had what I thought I ordered."
1,Sick Twisted Trash,"and the author stood us up at our book club after she had been invited and pretended like she was coming up to the 11th hour, finally stopped answering her phone and later apolgized with the excuse that she had gotten lost. Nonetheless, this is probably one of the worse books I have read in some time. The characters are never fully developed, the end does not tie the loose ends together and the the stories are anything but sexy and pretty twisted. I was dying to talk to Ms. Hobbs to find out her thoughts as she wrote the book and hopefully have it redeemed in my mind, but no such luck. Save your money."
3,Wicked.....,"Ms. Hobbs is an excellent author that has a very unique style of writing. She captures her readers in tales that go above and beyond the average mind and enters into the devious and yet oh so wicked minds of her characters.""Dangerously In Love"" was a great novel and for some reason her character Reed made me think of some type of sci-fi storyline. She gives African Americans a touch of Stephen King in the urban world!!Great job Ms. Hobbs!!!"
3,A lot of unanswered questions,I'm giving this a 3 because I hate to be mislead. There was nothing hot and steamy about this book. The sex scenes were dowright disgusting. There was no Love here. Ammon and Dayna's love scene was so short that I wasn't even sure if it happened. I have a lot of questions but the one that seems to boggle my mind most is: How could Buttercup lie at the end and say that she was held hostage for days if she had just gotten out of jail. Wouldn't someone at least check to see if her story holds up? I mean come on...Who edits this stuff anyway?
1,Where is the Love?,Dangerously in Love is a very raw story about one character's sick and twisted donward spiral to degrading and raping women. This story is fragmented and you are left wondering about how characters appeared in a scene. I also believe that there was no character development. This was essential to the development of the main character because he was a man with mental and social problems.
2,Dangerous,"I found this book to be a bit confusing, I think the author combined about four short stories into one book. The character Reed was so sick and twisted that at times I had to skip through his parts. This was truly a disturbing book and I should warn you the title is much better than what the book truly is about. I haven't given up on the author though I will try one more of her books and then if it's like this one.... Well let's just say it's a wrap!!"
4,I love Allison Hobb's Books!!,"Allison Hobbs is a wonderful writer! If you haven't read at least one of her books, you don't know what you are missing. I have read every single one of her books, can't wait for her to write more! This book was a great book that totally engaged my attention and kept me on the edge of my seat.I was so happy for Dayna in the ending. Reed was CRAZY!! This story could be anyone's story. A definite must-read. Loved it! Can't wait to read Hobbs' next book, ""Bonafide Golddigger."" I am RUNNING to the bookstore to get it her writing is so good! No disappointments here!"
3,Took a while to get through it!,This book was an ok read although it took me ahwile to read it! The characters were great ( Reed was a trip).But I would reccomend that you pick it up from the library.
4,Planet Waves 1/4 inch offset adapter,"Well made, makes for a solid connection, and useful when you want to save space on your pedal board. Primarily designed for jacks that are not directly across from each other on two pedals you're connecting together."
4,One of my Favorite Faith Books,"Another great book by Katherine Hall Page. It was fun to read a ""prequel"" to the mysteries Faith Fairchild falls into in Aleford and see her as a young single woman. The mystery was compelling and full of twists and turns and vivid characters, just like the Aleford entries in the series. If Page writes more of these, I hope we get to witness the entrance of Tom on the scene. I'd love to read about their courtship!Fun and a quick read. One of the best in the series."
3,Apple's a little mushy,"I was disappointed with this book. I like Faith Fairchild, although her gourmet attitude gets kind of annoying sometimes. I mean, reading about her life is like reading about a foreign country. But it can be very entertaining. But this time out, all we got were leftovers. It seems like the writer is getting tired of the Boston area and decided to cast around for more interesting backgrounds. We've done Paris, done Norway, done the coast, now it's time for NYC. Problem is, she left all the other characters we care about behind. By setting this book before Faith got married, all we hear about is her parents and sis (OK, kind of interesting), a boyfriend we know she didn't marry, and a friend we never heard of before. She didn't even include a epilogue that wrapped everything together and brought it back to the present. I was really disappointed."
1,A Flat Souffle,"All the ingredients are here: a gutsy heroine, money, a love interest, a mystery, a couple of murders, money, and beautiful people. Katherine Page stirs 'em all together, and even adds a cateress and a couple of recipes, just like some of the other leading mystery writers do.And what have we got? Well, not a sumptous feast and not even a pouffy souffle. What is served to us is ""The Body in the Big Apple"" (ok, the food analogy doesn't work here). It's a pitiful offering: not much of a novel, not much of an entertainment, not even a particuarly good presentation. I found myself dozing off during the last ten pages--I had figured out whodunit and why, and I really didn't much care one way or the other. Even the apple recipes at the end of the book were gimmicky and not very exciting.This book is not a good investment of your money or your time."
3,Great Beginning...Then Dribbles Off...,"The start of this book was a delight and I liked most of the characters. Neither the murder case nor the suspect were interesting enough for me; I found no reason to care. The parts of the book having to do with a homosexual relationahip were distasteful to me and unnecessary to the story. I found the plot hard to believe; I want to ""go along"" with the author and his premise but it was too much of a stretch in this novel. In more capable hands this could have been a really good book. As it was I read to the end and closed the book with relief that it was over."
3,to tell the truth,"exasperating, slapdash style abounds in incomplete and dangling sentences. pace lurches like a funicular. the main characters all have broken hearts but combative spirits. some courtroom drama. average."
1,"Before you buy, read Creative's customer reviews","Creative Labs is months behind in providing any kind of real support for the Webcam product. There are no FAQs, for instance, on the Webcam product.I went to the company's newsgroups and was *astonished* to see the large number of complaints about the Webcam from their own customers. Worse than that, I was stunned when I realized that not a single Creative employee had responded to these complaints!These are signs that a company is not listening to its customers, has no execution skills, and ultimately, probably will not survive. The stock price seems to indicate that the market is making its clout felt.To all Creative customers out there -- thank you for speaking up so that I could make an informed consumer choice this Christmas. I'm off to buy Intel's or Logitech's products."
2,Very Bad choice,I was so excited to buy this camera....what a let down...I think I got the thing to work maybe 3 times? It continuosly locks up..and the pictures are not the greatest...Look elsewhere!
2,A decent camera -- if it worked with AMD,"This camera has serious issues with people using AMD processors. I tried this camera on three (3) different systems all running AMD processors and it would not do anything but return two or three frames and freeze. When I tried this camera on two systems running Intel processors, it worked perfect in both cases. If you have an Intel processor and would like a descent and inexpensive camera, this is for you; however, if you have an AMD processor I would not suggest this product."
2,lots of trouble,I had nothing but trouble trying to get the Webcam 3 to work. It is unstayble; one second it works the next it dosn't. The webcam controller would not load somtimes and toword the end (before I gave up on it) it wouldn't load at all. I updated drivers for it and tried all kinds of things but nothing worked. When it did work it gave good images for a cmose Chip and had a good software bundel but what good is it win the thing won't work. I read an artical on the web that tests products and thay had the same problems. My advise; invest in another cam.
1,Problems From Installation,I have been having numerous problems with the installation of my webcam 3. I also went to the Creative site to download the new drivers and I am stil lhaving problems. Sometimes the cam would not respond when I try to start up. At times it would and then the Monitor software would not work. Any help available will be greatly appreciated.
4,"Great cam, but doesn't come w/live streaming video software","The quality of the pictures and videos are great! Easy to install. However, if you want to publish live streaming video on the web, you'll need to purchase additional software. This only comes with a software that captures still images and/or pre-recorded video for the web. I would have gave it 5 stars if it was clear on the box that streaming live video requires additional software & setup."
5,The greatest can opener EVER!,I love this can opener. I have had it for about 8 months now and I never have any problems with it. It cuts so smoothly and I have never had it skip like other reviewers have mentioned. It feels great when you use it. Nice and sturdy product.
1,Quick Failure,Worked great for a while then it won't even open a can after only 10 uses. Its poorly built.
1,Poorly designed mechanics,This can opener has the teeth on the drive gears to far apart allowing it to slip off and not open cans. The design and function of this can opener is very poor and does not meet kitchen aid standards which have dwindled dramatically.
1,Went Bad after one year of light use,"Initially worked great, very smooth action. Felt like it would last 100 years. About one year later, however, the action is very rough and it seems to ""skip"" while opening. Very disappointed."
1,Good looking - poor performance,"Looks nice, pretty colors, solid, heavyweight. But, after a few months my opener began to function poorly, the mechanism seemed to have loosened and it wouldn't open some cans. Now it doesn't work at all and I've thrown it out. I'm disappointed in this expensive, good-looking, but, unexpectedly poor performing product."
1,LOP SIDED,I have ordered and returned twice and my third one they sent has the same result.After a few uses it seems to twist off stroke and stays that way.
1,Initially satisfied; downhill from there,"I purchased this handsome can opener in June 2004. Feels & looks substantial and promising. It worked ok for a couple of months, and now it's useless. I'll return to using my zyliss opener, and throw this in the trash."
4,"good, but not great, can opener","The pros: Great styling, nice feel in the hand, sturdy mechanism.The cons: Sometimes it loses its grip on a can. I'm not sure why sometimes it will open a can fine and other times it keeps slipping off as the can is cut. This doesn't happen with my other can opener, something I paid similar money for at a grocery store a number of years ago.This KitchenAid can opener definitely works better than truly cheap can openers, but I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote that there are better can openers at this price point in terms of functionality."
3,Nice but beading detail too delicate,"Nice pair of shoes, however, the beading detail on the side comes of easily, so you have to be very careful when you have it on"
1,"poor quailty, unflattering",These were cute in the photo but very unflattering on my feet. My feel slide way forward throught the front. I returned them.
3,Charles David,"Shoes was ok...it was a bit big, if it was to my taste I would certainly have forced it to fit....but i wasnt so in love with. Sturdy shoes however."
3,Expiration Date,I purchased this product in bulk because I couldn't find it my local supermarket and it was a good price. I did have a problem with the fact that the expiration date on this product is feb. 2010. That's a short expiration time for any product considering I purchased it in oct. 2009. Most of the time the expiration date would be at least 12-18 months. So I question whether or not certain products sold by amazon are just old items in your inventory.
4,A comprehensive series of lectures on plasma physics,"This book is organized as a collection of lectures covering all main topics on the subject. A background in classical electromagnetism and fluid mechanics is of course needed, but no previous knowledge of plasma physics is required. A quite interesting and enjoyable undergraduate level book."
2,Unpromising first attempt,"In reading the text, when you see the defined word for ""sense of taste"" spelled ""pallet"" and the embryo of a chicken spelled ""yoke"" you know that this is a work that's going to need a lot of polishing. This DVD and several good cookbooks may help you in learning to cook. It is, however, encouraging to see 'chefs' with average knife skills and clips that haven't been cleaned up for the Food Network. Amateurish and sorely lacking in content. Two stars for brave attempt."
4,So Pure such an expression!,"This CD single, above the other So Pure singles out there is worth it because it is 4 songs. If you are going to get a So Pure, get this. The other single only has Would Not Come live and that's the same version as on That I Would Be Good. For the content of this CD...it's great. It has the album cut of So Pure and the Butch Vig remix of So Pure. This remix is about 6 minutes long I think and quite a departure. But it is good dance music. The live tracks speak volumes about Alanis' skill. The all acoustic I Was Hoping and So Pure Live are brilliantly done. Alanis is at her best, when it's her, a box, and a man strumming a guitar."
3,Don't buy without reading!,"I'm a fan of the Transplants with Tim Armstrong and this CD is NOT BY THEM!!! Their new album will be released May 2005. This CD is apparantly a greatest hits of a 70's punk band from Boston. From what I've read, they only released 1000 copies of this album and poor misinformed fans of the new Transplants like me are being hoodwinked into giving our money to a band we've never heard of. Trust me, you'll be pretty surprised when you get this! I e-mailed Amazon.com's customer service to ask them to please post some kind of notice stating that these are two different bands. At the moment there's even a ""Buy with the Transplants ~Transplants and save!"" button to make this even more tricky. Don't waste your money if you want the new Transplants. I think it's pretty sh**ty of the old Boston Transplants to sit around and laugh and collect another band's fans' money, too- FYI."
3,"campy, hilarious, but a sucky indeterminate ending","If you are a fan of ""arrogant human gets comeuppance"" this is for you!Perhaps because I had the lowest of expectations, I found myself cracking up at all the unintentional humor.The ending blows the build up though - you don't really see what happened to the tiger. There was no justice, nor was there a cynical ending. It's like the screenplay writers ran out of ideas or time."
3,Rip! Tear! Shred! Burp!...,"MANEATER concerns a small town w/ a big cat problem. A truck crashes, releasing a Bengal tiger to hunt for local prey. Several human snacks later, the sheriff (Gary Busey from SILVER BULLET, PREDATOR 2, and UNDER SIEGE) is on the case. Alas, Tigger isn't so easy to find, let alone stop! Many lives are lost, including a national guard unit! MANEATER has some bloody body parts in it, but actual violence is mostly offscreen. There's no real profanity or nudity either, which could be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. Worth a look..."
5,the best of jim chappell,"Jim Chappell's CDs come in a variety of flavors, from jazz to new age; this one is something in between and, I think, his best: melodic, but not too tinkly, either. Relaxing, yes, but more upbeat than Lullabies. I'm a bit surprised to be the first reviewer of Saturday's Rhapsody, since, for me, it stands out as a high point of the artist's recordings."
3,Good basic budget book,"This book is great if you don't know anything about budgets at all. It's a short quick read that doesn't really go in depth, very basic"
2,"Do Your Budget A Favor, Get A Different Book","This book isn't expensive and it isn't without merit, but I recommend you look elsewhere. With all due respect to the authors, this book is rather gimmicky. The flow of the book is choppy and at several points the authors drop the ball by treating various subject with a degree of shallowness that is disappointing even for such a small pocket book. One example is the treatment of credit cards. They repeat the common mantras about credit cards, but the coverage of situations not to use credits cards is repetitive and there is no discussion whatsoever of point-systems that many credit cards offer--an amazing way for a person on a budget to expand their purchasing power.I close the cover of this book feeling that I've just hung up the phone with a chatty telemarketer, somewhat impressed with their jovial presentation but feeling hardly educated by the interchange."
5,Realistic Budgeting!,"I am horrid at managing my money, and I found this book very helpful. First of all, it is very short and to the point, which is great for those of us with a limited attention span when it comes to financial issues! Second, I like that they recommended budgeting a lump sum for personal ""pocket"" money and other similar categories, rather that suggesting I track every soda or pack of gum I buy during the month."
2,carnivore,"We could list the significant forms, stances and pretenses that went into the making of this elaborate collage, but that would be as interesting as hearing this record a second time. How about the real stuff? The acts they filched? Left behind, in a world where enough noise can appear as soul.... Oh yeah, sound and fury, signifying nothing. If Korn is corn, this is peas and I miss the meat."
5,Incredibly helpful!!!,"I bought this book because I'm always looking for solutions to the problem, not just diagnosis of the problem. This is a very practical, pragmatic, reality based book. With every issues mentioned for ADD, the author gives ways to address it to help the one dealing with ADD. I learned things I did not know, such as the issues dealing with time/space and why this occurs. This is a must read for anyone with ADD or who lives in the same house with an ADD member. Tons of information - once you begin to read, you can't put it down."
5,great book for people with ADHD,"I've read and bought a few different books on ADHD - as a person with ADHD and therapist working with adults and kids with ADHD - this one is great for adults, as it covers just about everything - I found it helpful to understand more about how ADHD impacts my life - I plan to share it with my husband so he can understand more about ADHD, as well"
5,A great handbook,"This book taught me a lot about myself and what makes others tick, I would def recommend it. Great for professionals or parents"
3,"Good book, not all of it for me","I've only read about half of this book and so far, little of it has been helpful. Perhaps it's written to broadly for the advice to be applicable to me? There are some good ideas and it's nice to read something like this that's written by people in my situation as opposed to someone who has merely studied ADD/ADHD. Hopefully I can stick with it and finish reading it!"
4,Excellent,The book is excellent for any adult with ADD! I am only a few chapters into it and it has been helping me out so much with my ADD.
3,A little too negative,I was put off by this book's negative outlook on ADD. I am sure it has a lot of good information but liked Delivered from Distraction: Getting the Most out of Life with Attention Deficit Disorder a lot more.
5,This book changed my life...,"On a recommendation, I read You Mean I'm not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy! . What I saw was my life in front of me. This book gave me the knowledge and tools to help make changes in my life with issues that I had struggled with and had no answers to. This book gave me answers. I highly recommend this book"
3,Good but can be hard to get through,"My daughter has ADD, and I probably do as well, so I've read quite a bit on this subject. While the book is very informative and does give personal accounts of what it's like to live w/ AD/HD, I found it hard to get through. It seems to ramble a bit at times and the organization and even the choice of print size and font made it hard for me to stay interested after a while. Basically, it reads as if was written by someone with AD/HD-- (which of course, it was), but that's what makes it hard to get through at times! I found Driven to Distraction by Hallowell and even Women With Attention Deficit Disorder by Solden much easier to read and just as (if not more) informative, especially for an ADDer with a tendency to lose interest if the book doesn't captivate me early on. Also, if you are very well informed on the biology/neurology etc. of ADD the first three chapters don't offer anything new. Bottom line, worth reading, but there are better choices out there."
3,pretty good,"I suppose that some folks might like the folksy way of writing, but it didn't work for me so well. There is good information inside, but IMO there are better books on the subject out there."
4,"You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?","This book was/is very helpful in identifying and validating ADD and ADHD in adults and how it effects relationships, jobs, school, self concept, and day to day functioning. There are helpful strategies for coping with and improving many issues that plague the ADD/ADHD adult. It was confirming to recognize that the issues are real and can be dealt with to find success and happiness."
1,It sends the wrong message about ADD.,"While this book does have moments, for the most part, it seems that it is sending the wrong message about ADD. It makes ADD seem to be something bad, something which needs to be cured by the use of drugs like Ritalin. ADD research has come a long way since this book was written, and ADD is now seen more as a blessing in disguise. It is different way of thinking and interpreting the world. It isn't something that needs to be cured. There are far better books on the subject, such as ADD: A Different Perspective by Thom Hartmann. This book, on the other hand, could actually have dangerous results for people who read it. It may have an answer, but it may not be the right one."
3,Good but patronizing,Typical of many such US help books the reader is patronized but there are some effective insights and tools nevertheless
2,Condescending,"Don't buy this one. Really. I'm baffled by the good reviews. I am newly diagnosed as ADD, and of the handful of books I've read so far, this was easily the most condescending and least useful. It is written on an 8th grade level, with loads of examples of fake character studies accompanied by ""lessons"" that are beyond obvious. For example, we meet ""Bob,"" who has trouble with interpersonal relationships because he is always interrupting people. The advice the authors give is, if you resemble ""Bob,"" you should remind yourself to let the other person finish speaking before you speak.The authors concede several times that they are not therapists or psychologists, just people with ADD. What they fail to add is that they aren't very good writers.A better choice is to read ""Driven to Distraction"" -- it's way better written, has much more information, and won't condescend to you in such an exasperating and tedious way. I also liked ""Healing ADD."""
3,"You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!","I'm trying to read this book because I think it might be able to help me, but the truth is that the book bugs me. First of all, the stupid badly drawn pictures. They are unappealing and have no value that I can see. They're sure not entertaining or informative. Probably one of the authors' kids drew them or something. I sure hope they didn't pay someone for them.The second thing that bugs me is all the exclamation marks through the book, though I guess I should have seen that coming since there is one in the title. Maybe the authors thought 'ADDers' (wish they hadn't thought of that term) would be able to read a paragraph full of '!' better! NOT!Anyway, a little common sense could have made this an easier book to read."
3,Poorly organized information,"I read this two years ago seeking more information about my newly-diagnosed ""disorder"" and had it not been for the right meds, I'd have never been able to follow this book. It's for someone who's already diagnosed. The suggestions for organizing the ADD family are great, but are they realistic? I don't think so."
5,janhavnfun,This book was such an eye opener. You owe it to your self if this is about you or someone you love
2,Hard to read,"I have jumped around to different chapters. The reason is because I have dyslexia. I fine it dry and hard to follow, so I have read very little of it.I have gotten some gems, mostly mostly lists etc.Authors think they have write a long wordy book, with fancy words. It said at the beginning that people like me might find it hard to read.MAKE EASIER-MAKE SHORT AND TO THE POINT. Pretend I know nothing about ADD (which mostly true)If get though and SHORT,EASY book that I like, I might want read another more in depth, probably the same author."
5,"You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid Or Crazy",I found the book to be very informative and helpful. The information will assist me in addressing issues that I have dealt with for years and did not understand.
4,ADD,I bought it because I wanted to find out if I had ADD and it helped me to understand myself and change my opinions about myself.
4,"""You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!""","Our youngest son has ""ADD"" or ""ADDHD"" so we bought this book for him. I think he has enjoyed it very much and got additional help after reading the book. I would highly recommend it!"
4,Great on target Title for a Helpful Book,"I've found this book to be quite helpful as it opened up more areas of better understanding about ADD. The title is great as I beieve most people with ADD have probably said or thought that they were lazy, stupid or crazy at least once when they learned they have ADD. The book has helped to explain a lot of things from my childhood as well as adult years that sometimes seemed to point to being lazy, stupid or crazy, or just not quite on the same page as everyone else. It is liberating to know that there are others with similar experiences, and it is helps us understand some of the reasons that we do certain things or have difficulty with others. I recommend this book, as well as Women with ADD."
1,useless,"this book is nothing but useless fillers. There might be a few acceptable solutions offered somewhere at the end, but you have to look for them hard, because every more or less valuable thought is wrapped into pages and pages of meaningless and boring banalities. In addition to countless personal stories, the book will offer you such ""priceless"" suggestions like to check the costs of your treatment in case if you're uninsured (wow. thanks!) Imagine 440 pages of that."
3,Almost all the titles,"I enjoyed the last chapter. The last chapter is the one that helped me the mostto understand children ADD. I feel that there were many short stories that the authors tried to use in order to explain ADD, which I think there was no need. Some were repetitions and there was a time that I stopped reading because I almost knew what was coming. The last chapter was very descriptive and interesting."
5,I have lost 6 lbs by substituting this for sugar,"I am reordering this from Amazon. We have gotten it at Whole Foods as well but we go through it so quickly it is easier to get in large quantities from Amazon. My husband and I are coffee/tea junkies and I am embarrassed to say went through 4 pounds of sugar a month! We made this simple switch and I lost 6 lbs-no other changes. Granted, I eat very healthy foods and sugar was my big indulgence. This is the only substitute I have found that tastes just like sugar. We learned about it from the Jorge Cruise Belly Fat Cure book and also highly recommend that book. My husband followed it to the letter and lost 21 lbs in 6 weeks."
4,bad packaging,"The product its self if great, it tastes good in my coffee. However the resealable pouch is hardly that. The crystals get in it and prevent closure. You can get this stuff in a canister with a plastic lid and as or right now the cost per ounce is the same. Go for that one."
5,Great product,This fan is much quieter than my last fan. Can't tell you if it's exactly 3000 cfl butit does pull a lot of Air through the radiator. I would definitely recommend this product to others.
1,Disappointing waste of money,"It doesnt come close to 3000 cfm. They carefully word it ""up to 3000 cfm"". Up to must mean about 1000 cfm. I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere. I dont usually review but when I feel this ripped off I have to say something."
2,not convinced,"I bought this fan to replace a defective electric fan. I picked this one for it's compact size and cfm rating. While it does work and keeps the truck cool, it does not seem to provide the advertised cfm nor is it as quiet as claimed."
5,crazy dog,our sons dog is very smart for a except the fact he cannot get a drink of water without making a bigger mess than our 2 mutts and it saving damage to wood floor like it should
2,Inside the dome gets really dirty and almost impossible to clean,"This gets dirty pretty easily. I have a Doberman & Puli, so not too slimy of drinkers. It is hard to clean down inside the dome where it gets yucky. It is pretty noisy too. The pump has to be cleaned out often to keep a good flow. It is a rather small ""decorative"" fountain pump and clogs a lot. It takes forever to get it clean enough with a long bottle brush to let them continue drinking out of it. The filter gets the dog hair and slime ""chunks"" but it is just a carbon filled filter. You can see the grime build inside dome each day."
2,"UNFORTUNATELY, A WASTE OF TIME","Expected much more from this book. Unfortunately, doesn't say anything new. Just some old recyled ideas with a flashy title. Save your money."
1,Worthless,"A worthless and superficial book, politically biased. The Author's open sympaties for the Republican Right shouldn't have him forget some of the basics of his issues: to write about bottom-up use of technology without even quoting once the case of Wikipedia is an herculean albeit dubious achievement. But embracing a future invasion of Mars (and supporting the not so wise war in Iraq) borders on pure craziness"
4,New Rules for Organizations,"There are some chapters in An Army of Davids that you will probably skim over. Too bad considering the book is so short. But in the several sections where the prose is good, it's really good. Governments and organizations find themselves being re-shaped, whether they like it or not. It's about time. Organizational structures designed to serve the industrial era are still largely in place. Whether hierarchies get flattened as the author suggests, or get re-engineered altogether, the organization we have come to know over the last 50-100 years is history. Fasten your seatbelts, Dorothy."
4,A very enjoyable and insightful read,"I could find a few areas of disagreement with the author, but that would be nit-picking and I would probably be wrong anyway. Mr. Reynolds demonstrates a broad range of knowledge on a variety of interesting subjects and presents them in a manner that is extremely readable. Being in the technology business myself I wasn't sure if I'd really learn much that I didn't already know. I was wrong. I did learn. No doubt I am stating the obvious when I say that the future looks to be very interesting indeed. And as the author states several times, probably for good and for ill. Highly recommended."
4,Interesting book,This book got me thinking. It brings up some really interesting ideas that I am not sure I have truely digested all of them. But it got me thinking about creating my own website for my ideas and realizing it may be a success.
5,Great reading with a message you can't escape.,"Many of Tozer's books are broken up into many, many short chapters on a variety of subjects important to the faith. This approach makes it an easier read....but this book is still power-packed. I especially like the opening chapter, ""That Incredible Christian"". It is a delightful essay on the pardoxical nature of living one's life in Christ."
4,Great Binders--And The Price is Right,"I conduct training classes all over the country, and I travel extensively. I use the binders in my classes and find that these are the best of the lot.I've tried Cardinal and some of the other brands, but these are the best of what I can find lately.The binders are just not made like they used to be made. I still have some older binders from both Cardinal and Avery Dennison and they're much better quality."
5,Best binder,Most binders rings loosen and my papers fall out. This binder is worth it! Has that locking mechanism preventing the rings from coming apart. Finally!
2,Expensive but doesn't last,I had this opener and tried it with about a dozen cans and it lost its sharpness and now it was in the trash can. It's expensive for such a gadget and didn't work.
1,A bomb from the get-go!,"My faith in KitchenAid led me to purchase this opener, but it wasted no time in diappointing me. The problem is that it will not grip the cans consistantly, especially small ones like tuna fish. The result is a fight to perform what should be a simple routine task. Don't waste your money."
1,JUNK WITH A CAPITAL J-UNK,LASTED THRU 5 CANS WONT CUT ANYTHING PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. SHAME ON KITCHEN AID FOR THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE.
2,ripping cans open with a fork?!,"I got this can opener as part of a set that came with spoons and a bunch of other kitchen aid red kitchen gadgets.This can opener ..., that's really the best way to put it. I agree with a previous reviewer, I think the blade may be too short. Every time I open a can it leaves sections ""un-cut"" so that I have to use some kind of utensil (like a fork) to try and rip the partially open lid off. It doesn't feel sturdy, it doesn't grip on to the can the way other can openers so, and when you turn the handle (which is nice actually, it's easy to turn) the grip falls off sometimes. I know how to use a can opener so I am fairly certain this isn't user error here!Looks-wise this is nice looking can opener, but it has caused me more frustration that any other can opener I've owned, even cheap ones from the grocery store."
1,Worst can opener I've ever had,"I bought this can opener to match my kitchen- every appliance is KitchenAid and all of the accessories are empire red. But this can opener is worthless! I actually wrote to the company to let them know what a piece of junk this thing is. Quite simply, it looks good but doesn't work. Buy an ugly one that costs half as much."
1,Very poor product,"I cannot believe what an ergonomically ill-fitting and horribly working product this is. The best thing I can say about it is that it looks pretty. Some others are satisfied, so I can only surmise that there are vast differences in the quality of the products leaving the assembly line. Unfortunately, this brand-new can-opener is going in the trash."
5,Excellent can Opener!,"This can opener is extremely easy to use, I've never had any problems opening a can or it jamming on me like my old one did. It's a bit heavy for a can opener but I consider that a good thing for something I use almost daily!"
1,A Dud From KitchenAid,"Initially, this can opener worked o.k. However, after about a month of use the cutting blade seemed to be sort of dull. It became impossible to get a clean cut and became more difficult to manipulate. This can opener has plastic handles and is sort of flimsy despite its large size. My advice is to pass on this and buy a different opener that performs well and has a better track record."
1,Expensive junk,"I bought this nice looking can opener for my wife thinking that KitchenAid makes good stuff. Boy, was I wrong. It only lasted a few months and is junk."
1,opened only three cans,"This opener opened three cans and broke. My husband is Mr. fix everything and he said the way this opener was designed that if that part broke, then the can opener couldn't be fixed nor work it work again. I don't know what the part is called, it's the wheel under the cutter part that holds the can. Anyway, I am very disappointed with this and hate that I have to buy another opener without getting any use from this one."
2,broke after few uses,"it's broken after few uses. I go to the company web site, and its web site crashed. I bought one from Faberware, it does not look good as from KitchenAid, but it's working for 2 years. We keep it in from the drawer all the times, why waste money on it"
1,I've hated this can opener - twice!,"My entire kitchen is Kitchenaid. I bought this can opener three years ago. It was awful...difficult to use, shredded the paper at the top of the can's label, and was very difficult to get started. Because I love Kitchenaid products so much, I assumed that this was just a defective can opener, threw it away, and bought another. The second one was even worse! It worked okay the first couple of times, but now it barely cuts at all. It grinds the top of the can, making dents, but won't actually make a cut. Once I can get it started, I cannot finish it because it ""messes up"" the can pretty badly. This one is going in the garbage as well. :("
1,Junk. Don't buy it!,"This is a real disappointment from a name brand that has built it's reputation on quality. (How hard can it be to build a good can opener??) The blade & gear that are supposed to hold the edge of the can, don't meet well. If you DO get it to cut, it requires tremendous hand strength and multiple stops and starts, leaving uncut gaps in the rim. The handle is loose, but can't be tightened. You can buy 4 cheap can openers for the same price, that will last you for years."
1,Does NOT work - DO NOT BUY IT,It is hard to believe - but IT DOES NOT OPEN CANS. Seriously. Christmas morning with food preps well underway we discovered our brand new opener would not open cans. Unbeliveable!!
1,Nominally KitchenAid,"Purchased this 1.5 years ago. Checked out other reviews to see if anyone else was having problems. Our case seems consistent with what others have said - won't open anything, slipping constantly (seems like it needs a new clutch), would be better off being direct-drive, and shreds up the paper (cosmetic, I know, but when it cuts through this so handily I wonder why it is so poor at cutting what it should). It is shameful that the brand reputation of KitchenAid would be compromised by placing it on this poorly made product."
3,This is a so-so product!!,"I needed to buy a quality can opener so opening cans of formula would be made easier. Unfortunately this particular can opener is not the greatest. The mechanism is not predictable and you often need to perform a ""restart"". There are better choices at this price point."
2,It broke!,"It worked fine for the two or three years we had it and then...it broke. We used the can opener at least once a week, sometimes more since we don't use an electric can opener. Defective or just worn out? It's not like we opened 10 cans a day, but I don't think it was defective from the start. Eventually one of the parts became loose and the opener no longer gripped the lid enough to open it. Frustrated, I threw it out. I now see that KitchenAid offers a lifetime warranty on defective products but even if it were defective, I don't know that it's worth my time to investigate how to send it back and ship it. Besides, it's too late. It's gone and I bought a different brand can opener.I also thought the KitchenAid opener was a bit too hefty. It was also large and thus didn't fit very well in the utensil drawer."
1,Not up to Kitchen Aid standards,"I love Kitchen Aid products. I have spent extra in the past just to get the item with their name on it, because I knew it would be dependable. Sadly, this is not the case with their manual can openers. I went through 3 in about a six month period. I was so convinced that I was just getting bad ones (because they were Kitchen Aid), that I kept giving them another chance. They are great for the first few uses, but they begin to have problems soon after. They become unusable in no time."
1,HIDEOUS TOOL AND DANGEROUS!,"I HATE THIS CAN OPENER!!! I can get the can started, but hard as I may try to press, and I am very strong, the blade ceases to cut 2-3 times while going around the can. Then I cannot get it started again to try to open wide enough to spill the food out of the can. I have to bend the lid of the can with a dinner knife to get food out, and it is risky as it is so easy to slice a finger on the lid.I have no problem at all with a $4 opener from the grocery store!!!"
2,Unreliable,"I've been through two of these in about four years. I'm now looking for one that will hold up for a while, because I don't really enjoy being in the market for a can opener that often."
1,Save Your Money and Go To the Dollar Store,"Dollar Store can opener performs for 10 years,no problems.Kitchen Aid can opener does not open cans properly,leaves gaps.Save your money and get 2 cheapo Dollar Store openers and your kids will still be using this heirloom quality can opener.No really!"
4,I agree about translations...,"Having read a number of Garcia Marquez's works in Spanish and English, I was unprepared for the curt, almost truncated writing style of this work in the English translation. There are moments when Garcia Marquez's voice rings true, and the terrifying events kept me reading, but I plan on taking other reviewers' advice, and I will read it in Spanish to get the true ""sabor""."
2,was something lost in the translation???,This book shows how a gifted fiction writer can struggle with non-fiction. Makes what could have been a fascinating story into a rather dull one. Shows none of the poetry and mysticism that a reader of Garcia or other South American writers would expect. I keep thinking that somehow a good book was lost in the translation from Spanish to English.The stories main focus is on the day to day life in captivity of the various hostages. Very dull stuff. What would have been far more interesting is the story of Escabar - and how/why he was able to rise to be such a force in Colombian society.
2,A very confused narrative.,"When reading this book I kept imagining the editor who received an incoherent manuscript from a famous author about a fascinating subject matter. Possibly, a little like the Emperor's New Clothes dilemma. The narrative is confused, the segues often incomprenshible, and despite the inherently dramatic subject matter, a difficult read. Finally, I was left with no understanding of why Columbia? What social, polictical history led to and made possible this siege of kidnapping? A definite dissapointment."
4,Lots pf Hype,"I had heard that the book was a best seller in Iran. I found it interesting but in too much detail about each kidnapped person. As I had lived in Colombia for 4 years, I was interested in the neighborhoods, which came close to where I had lived. It was incredible to learn about the tremendous clout of the drug cartels with the government.SEGMD"
4,Pablo Escobar kidnaps and kills people.,"A great book about the narco terrorism in Columbia. Pablo Escobar kidnaps 9 prominent people and holds them until he gets the government to change the extratadition policy. The author details the kidnapping, but leaves out the story of the two drivers that were killed in the kidnapping. What about their families? The story is about the kidnap victims families and the effect on government policy."
4,"Garcia Marquez, the journalist","The author started out to write a book just on the kidnapping. He then expanded it to take in correlated events - apparently rather late in his writing. It shows: Although outside events, and the forces that created them, are mentioned, they remain frustratingly sketchy. A large role in convincing Escobar to surrender was the pressure the Cali syndicate put on him. They had ""extraditables"", too, but are not part of this book. . All in all, the author has written a book that is neither fish nor flesh."
1,Dissapointing Product,It is not sweet enough for me. It does not dissolve easily. The packets are prone to leaking. Possible insect infestation.
4,Great Quality!,These great quality sanding belts. I use them to sharpen knives. They have lasted 2-3 times longer than than the brand I was previously using and cost less. Big savings for me.
5,Good Product,"Product features good construction, snug fit and a decent life span. I have been using several types of these for over a year without problem. Would buy again."
3,Raved by French New Wave,"Raved by French new wave film directors, Johnny Guitar has a simple structure. The merit of the movie is the critical allusions to the Communist hunt in the USA. Also refreshing is the rekindling of middle age love after an infernal fire, incited by a mad woman with transparent neurosis. Allusion to the Ox Bow Incident (another woman killer driven by jealousy or repressed sexuality) is interesting, and it's gauche motive is worth another viewing. But Johnny Guitar is not a great film because the characters are unconvincing, unlike typical characters that we find in America. Remember that Robert Kennedy was a Communist hunter -- he was a reputable law school graduate, not a madman! In Johnny Guitar, good and evil are embodied in two female personages, who are not represented by the Catholic duality of mother or whore. This film has also obvious allusions to the strong female character, ex whore, played by the great Kate Jurado in High Noon."
2,"Johnny Guitar--,An all time low in ""Westerns""","This would be the worst film I have ever senn in my life---bar none. Onr huge factor is the ugly, flat performance by Mercedes McCambridge. Actually, Joan Crawford has always looked frightning to me, (her red slash of a grimacing mouth and heavy dark eyebrows and ""butch"" haiedo (in the 40s-50s) make her look like some kind of dominatrix. I know, when it comes to the 2 female stars of this movie, it is a double-dose of disaster. To have to ""put-up with"" over an hour with them invading the screen is intorable. Watching the movie is painful and I could have kicked myself for not walking out of the theater after the first 15 min. Then to top it of, the title song ""Johnny Guitar"" is worse than a dirge. Tuneless, boring and depressing and fits in perfectly with the misery of the film. Hearing it all the way thru the film was a huge downer. Pass on this real tripe---.No kidding."
2,Overrated cult western,I wanted to like this film.I really did.So many people I admire(Martin Scorcese for example)rave about this film.My problem is mainly with the performances.Joan Crawford overacts with a bug eyed intensity not seen since the days of silent movies.Which makes it impossible to overlook the fact that she is one of the least attractive(to put it kindly)leading ladies ever.She resembles a drag queen.And not a very passable one at that.
4,"""MODERN"" WESTERN",Strange 50's western but entertaining. Humor and violence. Crawford's casino is unique for its time. Actors are excellent. Some slow spots but entertaining. Love that theme song performed by Peggy Lee. You won't forget it. Filmed in the area of Sedona AZ .
4,A CULT FASCINATION.,"In old Arizona, the proprietress of a gambling saloon stakes a claim to valuable land and incurs the enmity of a lady banker. To movie fans, this film is probably most remembered as the western starring two women. In Crawford's post MILDRED PIERCE ""evil older woman"" period, she plays Vienna, depravity incarnate, who is always dressed in black & will do most anything to hold on to her saloon. Mercedes McCambridge, as Emma Small, plays the woman who wants to take away Vienna's saloon: this seemed a primer for the latter's foray in ""desperate women"" roles. Many label this movie as offbeat and baroque, although it isn't excessively violent: rather it's chock-full of Freudian overtones. It's impossible to capture the odd beauty of this complex genre film in a quick essay because it is truly a one-of-a-kind original.JOHNNY GUITAR certainly represents one of the most important Hollywood westerns, recognised at the time of its initial release by critics throughout Europe."
3,dorie,"I brought this movie because I am a fan of Joan Crawford , but I found this movie to be a bit corny. The acting was not as good as other Joan Crawford movies."
4,Johnny Guitar - The spoof musical,Very well put together spoof of westerns put together as a musical.I watched this production this year at the Cedar City Fall theatre festival. Well done and funny/
5,this album wakes up the soul...,"this takes you to a place of infinite rythm. i bought this particular album the very first day it came out. and, i still have the same cd. i listen to it everyday and still jam to it."
4,GOOD,I bought this book for my son and he really enjoys it. The only drawback is that the printing is a bit small and the illustrations are a bit too colourful.
3,disappointing purchase,"this book has beautiful illustrations but it is a very small book. that would be fine if the print were large but it's not. also, the changes the author makes in the stories do not improve them. my son does love this book though because it contains ""jack and the beanstalk"" -- one of his favorite stories."
2,Light on Proven Solutions,"I agree with Frank Smith. Teachers, schools, students are inundated with programming materials, etc.I also liked his suggestion of making assignments meaningful and developing an apprenticeship atmosphere.However, as an educational consultant and former teacher, I was seeking practical solutions. This book was heavy on the problems and light on the solutions."
3,Mediocre Performance,"My camera is less than a year old and already malfunctioning. The ""hideaway"" flash is jammed and there is debris on the inside on the viewfinder. The clarity is not as crisp as I had hoped and it often focuses on the wrong objects in the frame. Also, the ""panoramic"" photos come back developed as a regular sized picture with black bars on the top and bottom. (Getting true panoramic shots requires that the be blown up, further decreasing the clarity.) I would opt for a different camera."
4,repuesto camara fotografica maxima zoom evoca 115,"repuesto para camara fotográfica maxima zoom evoca fino 115 qd, en venezueala, el opturador no funciona aunque el zoom si lo hace, me gustaria saber de un centro autorizado de samsung en venezuela y si es posible en el táchira para llevar la camara. gracias."
4,good book,interesting book about the people on trial and the witnesses at the great Nuremberg trial after the end of WWII
4,Entertaining quick read,"I picked up this book a couple of years ago and it is a pretty entertaining read. Also, many mafia buffs have probably read ""Murder Machine"", by Jerry Capaci (IF you haven't, read it now!). In it one of the murders is done ny Dominick's uncle in the late 70's and it is the murder, which eventually lands him in jail. I am pretty sure, this is the same murder that involved Lou Eppolito's Uncle and Cousin. It has some good insight into a hit covered only breifly in Murder Machine, becasue it was a only of minor importance to that story. If you can find a copy, by Mafia Cop."
1,"waste of money, wast of time...","With the increasing interest about Opus Dei after the famous The Da Vinci Code, many voracious readers are searching for the truth behind the real -not the fictional- Opus Dei.This book has been written after Dan Brown's novel and quotes the novel several times. The author pretends to show the reality. But he doesn't.Those wanting objectivity must try another title perhaps."
2,Elevator music goes western..,"Only the ""Westbound"" track sounds good, the rest is just forgetable ""landscape"" music that could be found on the Weather Channel. Only for those with niche tastes like ""New Age"" music."
5,The Trifecta,"To truly appreciate Phillip Aaberg's music, you need to own his first three albums: this one, ""Out of the Frame"" and ""Upright."" This album was his debut, and is wistful yet melodic. My favourite song is ""Remembering This Place"" and all of the songs on this album have that kind of 'something is being lost here, and we need to recover it' feeling. It is a worthy purchase, and while it is not my number one Aaberg album, it is definately one of my faves."
3,"Nice art, so-so story","Honor's mom has recently passed away, and she meets a cute guy who is new in town. Unbeknownst to her, he is secretly working for her long lost grandfather and has some news about her family that Honor never even knew existed- she was a kidnap victim. Honor must deal with the news of her new family, and her emerging life as a rich heiress, while reconciling her mom's past crime.This was an ok HQ Comic. Honor and her boyfriend were attractively drawn, but I just found the story pretty bland. Nothing too exciting or challenging occurred, Honor and her boyfriend loved each other, the grandfather was charming and it was just overall sort of generic. Without more 'oomph' I can't say this was anything more than average."
5,6 Female Rats? They love it!,My female rats have not destroyed this product although I am sure they are capable of it. It is a great house for them. Not sure what else to say about it. It is awesome
3,Bob doesn't use it,"My guinea pig always hid in the back corner of his cage when he got scared, so I thought that him having a hiding place would be a great idea... he doesn't use it. In fact he pushes it out of the way and hides behind it."
5,love them,"these are perfect for the rabbits to hide in, and sit on. they are better with these in the cages."
2,my 2 hedgehogs hate these waste of money,my hedgehog hates these he rather sleep under the fleece that lines the bottom of his cage than this my new baby is the same way its a waste of money to me i could see why others like it maybe they would if it was a soild color not see thru so it didnt let light in
3,Mixed feelings,"Pedro's Ego Inflator Sport Bicycle PumpThe pump worked fine with the CO2 cartridge that came with it. I used the pump to pump balls and it worked fine till the CO2 ran out. I went out and bought the 12g CO2 cartridges at the local sporting goods store and they don't fit (Crosman CO2, 12g powerlet). If I can figure out where I can find replacements I would rate this product with 5 stars. Not being able to use the 12g cartridge is a real drag even though it says in the product features that it does."
3,A rare glimpse of the acoustic Dead,"This video is worthwhile for the single acoustic set that it contains. The electric sets that make of the rest of the video are pretty lackluster, with only minimal jamming. Hats off to the director for focusing on the band, though - I've seen a couple other Dead videos that focus way too much on the audience and don't even show many songs in their entirety. If you like the acoustic playing in this video, check out ""Reckoning"", the live album that was made from the same series of concerts from which Dead Ahead was created."
2,Drags like a busted elephant's foot.,"Not one of the best travel-related pieces I've read. Driving alone, de Vries has no-one to play off against so in order to provide some dialogue, she makes constant references to conversations with her cat throughout the book. This is funny the first time but should be left as a one-off joke. De Vries flogs it until it become irritating to read.In addition to this, I would assume large tracts are fictitious: the very odd-coincidencies, the almost-slapstick moment where she knocks an important boss into a pool, the 'stay with people after knowing them 10 minutes' etc. It can't have happened this way.One for the cat lovers; for readers who like travel, try something else."
4,Stranger on the road,"After loosing her mother Clare De Vries questions her life, and the answer is to travel across the U.S. with her aging philosopher cat Claudius.As she travels she meets various people, experiences some adventures, sees very interesting places, but she is not satisfied at all. It becomes clear that living her dream does not change her , she can not escape herself nor the realities of life. It is a sincere, funny, sad, sometimes depressive book, and I think an informative one for the ones who intend to travel across the U.S. by car."
5,I'm definitely collecting everything to do w. Alex!,"If you're reading this reveiw, read the one from Brin-Marie McLaughlin of San Fransisco too. I couldn't agree more; Alex definitely transforms sound into a whole 3-dimensional sensory experience!!! This music is so soulfully sophisticated!!!"
3,"Interesting, but could have been better","This one rates a 3.5 star reveiw. The story of a Canadian family living with their haunted house experiences as told through the eyes of the mother had promise, but suffers a bit through the lack of a good editing. What seems like endless repitition of the same information, along with a rather amatuerish style is somewhat distracting to the reader. The story itself is interesting and well presented, but if your looking for a good scare this one will likely leave you disappointed. There was one major flaw that as a reader left me truly frustrated; the author supplied some photos of what were thought to be siginificant objects related to the haunting, yet many more of these items were found and described but not photographed. There was also additional ""phenomenon"" such as handprints that appeared several times but were not photographed. It seems very odd that the author would photograph some of these items and events and not bother with others."
4,Great book,Facinating story- very interesting and one of those books you look forward to picking up and reading it in one go- highly recommended for people interested in real ghost stories.
3,"Drawn out, too much of the same details","Although I felt for the family, I found it odd that so many years went by without more outside investigation.Too many accounts of the same occurrences over and over again without action.I very much enjoy stories of actual hauntings so from that standpoint it was enjoyable.I would recommend to anyone who is interested in reading about these experiences"
1,Typos galore,I got the kindle free sample and never made it through because of all the typos. Hire an editor please.
4,What HAPPENED?????,This was a very good ghost story. There were tons of details about the family's experience in this wonderful old house. I wish there had been more success with having a psychic involved. I'd really like to hear more about what happened to the poor spirits who were there.
2,It's just okay.,"I don't like writing reviews where I thrash a book or a movie because I don't want to ruin it for other people. For my taste, the book was a bit slow; but to others it may be what you like."
5,A book well worth reading,"I don't usually read ghost related stories, but I have to admit I had a good time reading this book and enjoyed it more than I actually expected to. The cover caught my eye and intrigued me, and once I started reading the story I couldn't stop. I'd be lying if I said it didn't scare me in some parts, but overall it's more thought provoking than a horror movie type of plot. Maybe that is why I liked it so much. This is a great book to read on a dark and stormy Autumn night, or any time for that matter."
4,"My ""Incredible True"" Review","A family is mystically compelled to move into an old house where they all subsequently experienced ghostly phenomena, yet weren't particularly frightened and still felt an inexplicable connection to the place. Not very scary (the cover image is misleadingly ominous) but quite interesting, especially re: unusual phenomena such as apports that couldn't have existed (e.g. a pristine newspaper from 1933, which suddenly appeared under the porch where it hadn't been before, and quickly aged in the days after being found) and a lamp that flashed morse code (""SOS,"" natch). A well-articulated and calmly documented account that provides new insights into ghostly phenomena."
5,Excellent perspective into the paranormal,"Interested in all things paranormal, I had goosebumps when I went through the chapters of the book. My family had also had a history of living in haunted houses before, and some of the accounts described in the book were very similar. It is very hard to believe when you have never experienced it. It is somewhat sad to know that ghosts make their presence known as a cry for help. I finished the book in less than two days, it was so compellng!"
3,"Good read, not great","I enjoyed reading it, but if you're looking for something to run chills up your spine, this ain't it. Not very scary and almost monotonus."
4,Nice Book Puzzling Family,"I am an avid reader of true ghost stories (well, truth depends on your beliefs) and looked forward to reading this one. The book is nicely written, although i couldn't help but be puzzled why, if the family was experiencing such hauntings, they would stay where they were.(almost as if, 'hey, this would be a good book, let's get more info') I thought it was a little short on haunting detail which i would have liked to see, but i tend to compare everything to Hans Holzer's accounts, particularly those using mediums he worked with and then the way he tried to prove or disprove the information he gleaned. An enjoyable book, but not one of the best... i'd give it a 3.5 stars"
3,A so-so Book,"This was an almost ""light hearted"" read about the haunting of this family's home. I found their experiences interesting and certainly somewhat chilling, but I think the book would have benefited from another perspective. The author repeatedly states that due to financial constraints, a psychical or paranormal researcher was never brought in. That's a pity. What you look for as a fan of this type of phenomenon, is substantiation or at least verification from another source of the activity. But, all in all, I enjoyed the book. It's not lengthy, read it in one day easily."
2,A little stretched,"OK, maybe it's all true, but everything seemed a little exagerated or maybe a little bit out of perspective. If some of the things the author said happened,I believe she'd have been out of there, family in tow. Being drawn to a house??? Aren't we all? Haunted or not. Good weekend read if you like this kind of stuff, but I'm skeptical that time hasn't changed some ""memories"" here to a little warped out of shape."
5,Essential part of the Candyland Saga,"Big fan of all of MF Grimm's output, my fav album by far was Hunt for the Gingerbread Man. When I discovered there was this mixtape, I knew I had to get it. It doesn't disappoint; it adds more depth to the Candyland Saga."
4,Flexible Solution that's easy to use,"The conflict alerts were invaluable in ensuring we didn't double-book people, and the on line views allow you to maximize people's schedules. The product was very flexible for accomodating multiple projects and people. I highly recommend it, especially for the price."
3,Does the job in a pinch.,"This product is okay, and works well enough. I had to get one fast due to the California law taking place on July 1, 2008. However, I will continue to look for a better product. I don't like the fact that the same button is use to turn the device off and on as well as to redial the last number. I have redialed people when I was trying to turn the thing off."
1,Motorola Blue Tooth,Too bulky and too far away from the eardrum to be heard clearly. Too much background noise made communication impossible.
5,Motorola H502 (Teal),I love it. I have had several including the new one that goes around the back of your head. It cost 85 dollars at the sprint store so I thought it was top of the line. It sucked when you tried to drive and talk it would pick up all the outside noise. This one is great people hear me clearly and it doesn't sound like you are in a tunnel. I hear well with it and I put everything on super loud including my TV so I was surprised when I could hear so well with this one. Also the fit is perfect and it is so light you forget you have it on. It doesn't make your ear hot or irritated like other ones do. I recommend it to everyone don't let the cheap price fool you. The less controls the better for me.
1,Don't waste the $$$$,"This dvd will not play in your DVD player, it only plays through your PC. I was really annoyed because who wants to look at a computer screen while performing this martial art? The introduction was odd. You see the instructor going through his version of tai chi and you have his talking head in the bottom right corner of your monitor's screen explaining his movements. It's long-winded, and inconvenient. An awful example to follow for beginners. I'm checking out Scott Coles' DVD tai chi series next."
1,Anti Birth Control Slant Makes this Book a Piece of Trash,"I not only want my money back, I want the author to pay me for the time I spent reading this piece of trash. If you are one of the ten people in the world who believes that birth control pills should be outlawed, this book is for you. But if you were born with a brain, then don't waste your money on this book."
5,LITTLE SISTER LOST-----5 STARS!!!,"LITTLE SISTER LOST is an amazing work---based on true events but as exciting as any novel you will ever pick up! The back-drop of facts (that many of us remember) interlaced with fictional, but very believable characters make this a book hard to put down, and when it is over you will wish it wasn't. There rarely is a slow moment throughout, and whether one is old enough to have experienced this era of our country's past, or he/she is just newly introduced to these historical facts, I can't imagine a reader not being fascinated by this intriguing story. Those readers so inclined will enjoy the comparison's between our capitalistic society and communism. Others may be more drawn to the main character's personal struggles and how his religious beliefs bolster him through painful times. Personally, I think it all blends quite harmoniously into one very good book!!!!"
4,a great book...,"Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw was a great read. The action is realistic and the character's dialoug dynamic. The story is about a poor flower girl and how two men place a bet on her. One says that she could pass as duchess if she is taught proper manners, speech, and dress while the other think she can not. This book is filled with many funny moments and tense times. :)"
3,"Cleanser was nice, but toner was unpleasant to use","I normally use a simple regimen of Clean and Clear sensitive cleanser and Neutrogena Healthy Skin salcylic acid treatment. This worked as well as, but no better, than those drugstore products.However, I would not recommend the system based on the toner: I found that it felt tacky on my skin, and within a few hours, my trouble spots seemed shiner than ever."
3,acne treatment,I have not been a teenager for a while now but still suffer from occasional oubreaks of acne. This is a 2 product system. i've been using everyday. My skin feels clean but there is little change in my acne or black heads. It does not ruin the towels which is a benifit. If I had to choose between products that contain peroxide or this product I would choose this product.
4,"Smells good, seems to work","This acne product has a pleasant scent and seems to work well on skin that has a problem with pimples. I like that it is not harsh like some acne medications are, and that it is ""organic."" It doesn't leave a residue on my skin. I haven't used it long enough to know if it works well long-term, but so far so good. I'll keep using it."
4,"It works, but with some drying . . .","I'm prone to dry skin, so one of the major qualities I look for in acne medication is a preparation which doesn't dry my skin out any more than it does by itself.A week after using this product, I noticed a big difference in the clarity of my skin. Nature's Gate actually works a lot better than many better-known and more expensive acne treatment systems. Unfortunately, it does tend to dry out my skin to an uncomfortable extent, so it's caused me to use it with some very careful application of moisturizer. This can make the balance between dry skin and blemishes tough to manage perfectly, but I've managed to do so.I can recommend this product with the caveats that it doesn't take very much to take care of minor skin problems - don't overuse it, or you'll just dry out your skin and cause secondary problems. I'm also not clear on the ""organic"" aspect of this product . . . that seems to be pushing things a bit far with little explanation."
3,Doesn't work as well as others,"I've been using Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment for 3 weeks now and sadly I have to say that my $5.00 drug store stuff works better. I followed directions completely and it just doesn't do the trick for me. It also has a very strange odor that does go away after a while, but it is hard to get used to. Maybe this works better on some skin types than others, but it just isn't for me."
4,Works well enough,"I have always wanted to try one of these systems. I thought: Hey, it's only a few minutes a day, and my skin will be clear.Well, that was right and wrong.I wash my face daily. I have a routine I follow. The 'simple' three steps aren't that bad, but they mess up the other things I do for my skin. This is a great product for folks with no other issues with their skin.It was not over-drying. It worked to clarify my skin.My blemishes on my neck even cleared up. But to do this daily, I'm not sure I would ever manange it.Overall, a good product."
4,Effective,This product works. I can see a visible difference in 2 weeks. It does decrease oiliness and yet doesn't dry the skin too much. It has salicylate in it which is the most effective agent for acne. Recommended.
2,Still waiting....,"Granted, not every product will work for every person, but 10 days into this and I notice no difference at all in my teen's skin. She was really looking forward to seeing the difference. I can see by the other reviews that they have had success with the product, but we have not. I will give it a bit longer and update this review if needed."
3,"Not As Good As Other Products, Excessively Drying","I've tried a variety of products for acne, and was anxious to give this product a try to see if it offered any better results.I'm regret to say that this product didn't produce the results as quickly as other products and, in turn, left me with excessively dry skin in the T-zone.The advantage to this particular acne treatment system is that it has a much better smell than other treatments."
2,Not drying but didn't clear up acne,"I bought this after reading the review by the woman in her 30's saying it didn't dry out her skin ect. For me, this product was useless in clearing up acne. I broke out the entire time I used it. The cleanser & astringent aren't enough. I used them up over a month ago & have maybe a 1/4 of the cream left. The only good thing it seemed to do was help to exfoliate my skin keeping away the dry winter flakes that are included with my acne. Crazy, but that's me. Salicylic Acid isn't rated as being too safe if you are pregnate or want to have kids... hardly Organic!! I didn't know this until after I was using it. I will finish it up so it doesn't go to waste but will not purchase in the future."
1,Face turned red like a chemical burn after using Acne lotion,"I used this product for a few weeks until one night when my skin had a very strong reaction. My face turned red as if I had been out in the sun all day and got burned like a lobster. The experience scared me out of ever using this product again. I guess Salacylic Acid can be harsh on some skin types, but this was worse than anything I've ever experienced. Even my Mom was scared when she saw my face and how red it was. She just kept saying over and over again ""that's scary,"" as if on replay. I hope this review my save other people my same fate. Be careful when using this product, especially the Acne Lotion."
2,No change,"I'm prone to breakouts in the summer months so I gave this a try. My skin had the same reaction initially to it as when I used Retin-A in the past. It got a bit dry and itchy. But unlike with Retin-A, I didn't notice any clearing of the area from breakouts in the following days so I stopped using it. Can't say it was effective enough to want to try again at this point."
2,Undecided,"I would not feel good about recommending this product to any of my friends at this time. I know the product says it may take up to 6 weeks to work but...I have been using it for 5 and a half weeks and my skin is broken out worse than ever. It started breaking out the first day I used the product, and in places I don't usually break out (jawline, cheeks). I resolved to give it the full 6 weeks, but have not seen any improvement! Also, the toner runs out after about 5 weeks but there is still plenty of cleanser and lotion. Unless there is significant improvement in the next few days, I will not buy this product again."
2,a disaster for my middle-age super oily skin,"Well, I used the product with high hopes, following the steps as directed, and the first couple of times, my face felt pretty good. Steps one and two made my face feel ultra-clean--dry really--and the moisturizer made it feel good. Soon, however, my skin started to burn, itch and hurt and it had the texture of sandpaper. Ouch! Too bad it didn't work for me. I'll hand it down to my son, maybe he can get some use out of it. But I am skeptical, because I don't think he would have the patience and diligence to follow the steps and do the whole program, as it is meant to be used. If you are reading these reviews and considering buying this product, I am sure that you are motivated to give it a fair try. That's the only way you can know."
2,I had something done that was worth every cent!,"Anyone fighting acne like I have for the past 2 years, theres a procedure called Levulan. It's worth it. It's like a peel, but not as harsh or drastic. My skin has cleared 98% after 1 treatment. I only purchase organic/animal cruelty free products and while natures gate is a great product, I didn't really care for all the steps to cleaning my skin."
2,"After four days, a rash developed...","My thirteen-year-old daughter tried this product for her run-of-the-mill acne. After four days, she developed a rash and had to stop using it. I don't know what triggered her sensitivity."
1,This didn't work for me.,"I always expect great (or at least somewhat noticeable) results with skin care regimens...so that's what I was expecting with Nature's Gate. Unfortunately, I didn't get the results I was hoping for.Honestly, I didn't see much change at all (except for a dried out face). Granted, I didn't use the product for the entire month--but I figure if I didn't see any noticeable results after two weeks, I probably wasn't going to see any after a month."
3,I should have known ...,"This wouldn't work for me. I barely have any acne, but I thought I'd try this and see if it improved things.I should have known better, but salicylic acid products don't work on my face. I gave it 3 stars because I do appreciate that the product is a natuaral product. But, this product didn't really work for me. It actually made my skin worse, which is regular for me when I use salicylic acid. If salicylic acid works for you though, by all means give this product a try."
3,Pretty Okay Face Wash (B- Grade),I really did enjoy the face wash portion of the kit but found the toner to be lacking and the moisturizer too oily. The whole kit lasted about 2 weeks.Overall it is an okay product but I rather stick with other face care products.Katiebabs
1,"Might not be a fair comparison, but didn't work for cystic acne","Our nephew has cystic acne and we got this product for him. It didn't help much (a little but barely noticeable*), but then really, the only thing that seems to help his acne is antibiotics. So, it might not be a fair evaluation of the product. If you have just regular acne, this might be great. It just didn't help his much. *On the ""barely noticeable"", it might have cleared up the parts of his skin that have regular acne but it didn't touch the boil-like cysts."
3,I wish you could test it before spending money on it.,"I'm a little like some of the others who have reviewed. Though I rarely have problems with lotions, this isn't the first time this happened to me. With an ingredient list a mile long, I'm not surprised that it burned! ;-) Just because something is ""natural"" or ""organic"" doesn't mean it still can't be toxic.I'm still giving this item three-stars simply because it might very well work for some people. I just wish there were a way to send-off for a sample of the lotion first, to see if it's going to irritate your skin before you purchase the kit."
2,Not for sensitive skin,"Organic does not equal safe for sensitive or allergic skin. I knew that before trying this product, but thought it looked safe to try despite the ""drying"" effects noted in the literature.After the first application, the skin on one cheek became inflamed and a breakout actually worsened. The rest of the face became extremely dry and uncomfortable.This may be a good product for oily skin, but it is definitely too strong for sensitive skin."
2,Harsh on the skin,"For people with sensitive skin, this might not be the best product. It is similar to Proactive in price and in application but after using this product for two weeks what looked and felt like a chemical burn appeared all over teenager's face. In addition, it didn't appear to clear up any blemishes.I don't recommend this product there are more gentle products for controlling acne on the market."
2,Not the greatest...,"I got this product for my daughter who is one of those Proactive gotta have types. I figured this product being organic would be good for her. WRONG. according to her, her skin felt greasy when she got to the last step. She claimed the smell was good, but she didn't get a clean tingly feeling once she finished, so according to her, the system was a zilch. that is it. not recommended by me at all."
3,Nothing too exciting,"I did feel some burn after applying the lotion, but no flaming rashes here thankfully. Nothing unusual, especially if you have used skin scrubs in the past. The smell was pretty neutral for all 3 components, which is a big plus for me. As to the success I had in using it to clear my acne? I have only mild, occasional acne, and it seemed to do the job within 3 days. Then again, would my blemishes have disappeared within 4? Probably.From what I saw from the other reviewers, I wouldn't expect any magical results if you have severe acne. But from my experience, the system's worth a try if other brands have failed you."
3,Just ok,"This is an ok product. We used it in the family, so more than one person tried it and we neither felt it has outstanding effects, nor negative effects. We will probably not re-order."
4,Skin feels great....,I have oily skin and this product makes my skin feel balanced and clean. I have seen a great improvement on my skin within a week. My skin just feels really great now after using this. I try to be consistent of using it daily for better results. I really like the fact that this product is natural and organic without harsh chemicals and ingredients found on other products.
2,"This works, but is very harsh on sensitive skin.","I have two grandnieces with problem skin. The oldest used it for one day and stopped because it irritated her skin so badly, almost like she was sunburned. The other grandniece used it for four days, saw an improvement of a breakout on her forehead, but her skin became so irritated she had to stop. She too looked like she had a sunburn. This product works, but it is also very harsh. From what I have read of other reviews it seems fair, easily sunburned skin can't tolerate this treatment. And both my girls are very fair and have to slather on the sunscreen when they spend any time in the sun. Too bad, the girls and I had high hopes for this as a less expensive alternative to Proactive."
3,dry skin,"Ok I suffer from adult acne. Tried this for three days it cleared up my acne after two days, but bare in mind it was just a few bumps, afterwards I realized how dry my skin is to where as it is ashy. this worked just as well as the over the counter stuff. it does not smell bad that was a plus. overall if you have serious acne I do not know how well it will work, but a few bumps it worked,"
1,didnt work for me,"This didn't work for me. I barely have any acne, but I thought I'd try this and see if it improved things. I used it for a few weeks and I think it made it worse. I think it was starting to make me get a rash so I quit using it.But- Nature's Gate makes great products, I use a lot of their other stuff. It didn't work for me, but maybe I have some kind of an allergy or something."
2,Ouch! My skin hurts!,"I'm very into natural products so I did not want to try straight-out Benzoyl peroxide or say 3% straight Salicylic Acid for my adult acne. I was pleased to see Nature's Gate offered a natural alternative. I used the wash, toner & lotion just ONCE/day for a week. I do have sensitive skin, but think most people w/ acne do. Anyway, all 6-7 evenings I tried it, my skin immediately flared up into a slight burning feel & a red appearance just minutes after application. I think a combo of the salicylic acid, the oligopeptide-10 and the tea tree oil (combined w/ many other listed products, some totally natural, some totally not), was far too much for my skin to handle. My fave brand for natural skin care is Aubrey Organics. I just learned they now make a Sensitive Skin wash, toner & lotion, so I'm off to try that next. I quit the Nature's Gate and won't try it again. Good luck!"
4,EDITH STEIN: ST. TERESA BENEDICTA OF THE CROSS,"This is a very interesting book written by her niece which gives a lot of the family story and insight. I feel after reading the book, I would like to know more about her niece, Maria Ruiz S., the author."
5,"Gay Song, Definitely","I know a bunch of people are trying to find the song in the beginning of the film at the End of the World Party, where Paul is talking to the two guys and one guy says ""I love this song,"" and Paul thinks ""Gay song, definitely,"" and asks him if he has any E. It was my favorite score from the movie, and it took me a while to find it.It's not on the soundtrack, but it's called ""Gay Song, Definitely"", and it's part of the film score done by Tomandandy. You can hear it online, and even legally download it, at http://www.last.fm/music/Tomandandy/_/Gay+Song%2C+Definitely ."
4,Fabulous,"This soundtrack was very well-chosen. The feel of the songs was perfect for the movie, particularly ""Without You"" by Harry Nilsson--I won't spoil it for you, but the melodrama of this song is very effective for the particular scene in which we hear it in the movie."
4,//,"the book is wonderful, the movie was amazing, and the soundtrack fits both perfectly. it's missing a couple of songs of course as a lot of people have noticed, but if you're looking for certain ones (a couple done by tomandandy) check out tomandandy's site for some downloads. they have a couple of the unreleased songs from the soundtrack there."
3,Rules of Attraction,"Buyer beware. After watching the movie and hearing so many great songs I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack. But I am disapointed. So many great songs that are in the movie are not on the soundtrack: The PIL song; the german rap song, the George Michael song and others."
3,song name needed,does anyone know who sings the song that plays while lauren is looking at the STD book and starts crying??
3,"""She Hates Me?""","To the music fan in Mex. City. I believe the missing song is ""She Hates Me"" by Puddle of Mudd? I know that I was disappointed it wasn't on the soundtrack myself but it's a good CD nonetheless."
5,Old School Rockin',"Ok, so I went and saw this movie last night.Let me tell you this is no teenie bopper American Pie ... movie.Children beware, you will walk out totally disgusted, or having a new appreciation for love & relationships & sex & drugs & homosexuality & homicidal/suicidal thoughts & psychotic behavior and all of the good or damage they can do. You will identify with at least one of the characters and it will put the fear in you.As far as the soundtrack goes, ROCK ON!!!!If you like some of the older new wave/alternative music, this album is for you. Mid 20/late 20 listeners, you will remember each and every song heard throughout the film.If you have no appreciation for oldies but goodies than keep listening to your Top 40 radio stations and steer clear.Note to everyone...BUY THIS ALBUM and for the love of God...SEE THIS MOVIE. It is ... believable!"
2,THE NAME OF THAT SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THE NAME OF THE SONG AT THE END OF THE WORLD PARTY IS""The Rapture - Out Of The Races And Onto The Tracks""THANK YOU I AM A HERO"
1,No good.,"I thought that this cd would be cool, because I liked the music in the movie. Unfortunately, the one song I liked -- the one that was played at the party with the huge burning statue thing -- was not on it. That [stinks] and the rest of the cd does too, except the ""Carol of the Bells"" and ""Out of the Races and On To the Tracks"". Also, the part in the movie where Victor talks about his vacation real fast with a song in the background is on this, which would be okay if the dialogue wasn't there. All in all, thoroughly horrible."
3,"Phun, Phat and Phunky Soundtrack","As much as this movie, I dig the soundtrack. Someone earlier mentioned Die Fantastischen Vier, and I'm not sure if they're on this soundtrack/score, but Ich liebe Tag am Meer und Sieh Dich im Spiegel An! Even if you don't speak German, check-out their album - Die 4. Dimension. Das ist fantastisch!"
3,NAME OF GERMAN RAP SONG FROM SATURDAY NIGHT PARTY SCENE!,The actual name and artist for the German Rap song in the Saturday night party scene isDer Wolf-Sei Dein Eigener HeldHope this helps some of you out.
4,"OK, what is this song?","Good soundtrack. I'm asking, like others have, for the artist and title of the 2ND song during the Edge of the World Party (with the burning man outside). It starts exactly 30 minutes into the film when Paul is ending his talk to Mitch and his girl. It really kicks in when Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek) first shows up at the party and walks by Eric Stoltz. Pretty serious jam and no one seems to know who it is. Please email me at mr_cynic@webtv.net or post here because apparently a LOT of people want to know who did this song..."
3,The Rules of Attraction,I loved this movie so I looked for the soundtrack and there is still a song that is not on the soundtrack. It's the song that was playing at the end of the world party not the song: Out of the Races and On to the Tracks by The Rapture it was another song that sounded dark kinda trip-hop. Does anyone know this song?
3,Missing Tomandandy tracks!,"There's a lot of fun stuff on this cd but it's absolutely killing what's *not* here. The most important part of the film's soundtrack (along with ""Carol of the Bells"", which is included) is the (presumably) Tomandandy track that is kind of a combination of ""Ode to Joy"" and a campus fight song. That track - and different versions of it occur repatedly in the film I seem to remember - is not on the cd. That's bad since you can, as it were, get your Blondie and your Love and Rockets anywhere, while the Tomandandy track is unavailable elsewhere."
3,Rules of Attraction,"To a music fan in mexico city writing in april -- I also liked the song from the dressed to get ----ed party, but you're right, it's not on the soundtrack. You can find it on the 2003 album ""A Beautiful World"" by Thicke, track 5 ""When I Get You Alone."" Enjoy!"
3,Excellent movie but the best songsr are missing!!,Like some of you I'm searching this song which comes twice during the suicide scene of that girl and when Sean punches that blond girl!This song stayes in my mind but I can't find it! it's stupid!Please answer me if you know it at pirosmax@yahoo.comthx
4,Review,"A lot of familiar songs such as Harry Nilsson's ""Without You"" and Love and Rocket's ""So Alive"", that we've all heard many times since the 1980's, but have a new feel to them after viewing their placements in this dark and satirical film. I've been listening to this in my portable player for the last 3 days, and still feel odd and fuzzy during some songs. Either that or it's the medication."
3,The part where Bateman punches out Laura's roomate,"A lot of people are asking about the music that plays when Bateman punches out laura's roomate. Well if you listen to the commentary by the director, he says that it's part of the score. I am guessing that it's unreleased and if you wish to, you can rip it from the dvd audio. It's quite clear, with little background noise. ciao."
3,Name of the song?,"What's the song playing while Sean is driving Mitch's yellow Mercedes to Rupert's house to buy drugs? Lyric sounds like ""one thousand times...""Artist? Thanks."
3,END CREDITS SONG???,"Does anyone know the name of the final lounge type song sung over the end credits and how one can get the complete song? Not the ERASURE song but the one after that -- Been trying to figure it out -- seems impossible since it's not on the soundtrack. I think the lyrics go something like, ""You are the one, you make it happen, the things you do are totally planned -- You are the one, you're so in charge now..."" Hope someone can help me out with this."
3,Name of the song at the party,"Hey i have no idea what the name of the song at the ""dressed to get ____ Party"" Please let me know if you have any idea what that song is. I know others have been asking. Thanx"
4,Song not on soundtrack,"i think the song is playing at the party is Die Fantasische Vier, a german rap group that are kind of like a german beastie boys. i have a couple of cd's of theirs that i really like. it sounds like them and it is certainly in german, but i am not positive"
3,missing song,"""There is a song they play when sean is in his room and i cant figure out who the artist is it go's ""i could be black I could be white, i could be wrong i could be right"" please let me know if you know who this is thanks ""It is ""Rise,"" bye Public Image Ltd. John Lydon's 80s band after the Pistols split."
5,History for Some... Legacy for others,"As a descendant of two families that were a part Carter's manumission, I found this work to be as enlightening and moving as the first time I saw a microfilm copy of the ""Deed of Gift "". I pray that this work will become a standard in the library of every person that enjoys the study of American History. It is a testimate to the legacy of my family and the other descendants of the 500 manumitted by Robert Carter the III."
5,A Carter who actually did something IMPORTANT!!!,"This is a must read for any fan of American biography,The author, Andrew Levy, got his M.A. from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. That is enough for me.One editoial review called this work ""luminous"". Wow. What an under statement.Get this book from your local public library or better yet buy it from Amazon.com. It is a keeper.Robert Carter comes across under the able pen of Andrew Levy as a real, live Virginia planter of the 18th century. His wife was a virtual ""foreigner"" since she was a native of Baltimore County and of an arising industrial class.One negative comment: Andrew, more pictures and maps would have been very helpful. The color picture of Robert Carter on the dust jacket is great but just not enough. He was not half-bad looking. I want to see what Mrs. Carter and some of the little Carters looked like.This is just a super book. I am loving it. Looks like major epic movie material to me but they would probably screw it up."
5,Great CD,"This group performs at UC Berkeley every couple years. I was fortunate enough to go twice, once in 2001 and last year. An example of how the universal language of music transcends culture and time. bestirantravel.com/culture/musicperformance.html"
1,Boettke is Non-Inspiring,"This treatise lacks a great deal in the way of practicality. Mr. Boettke offers a great deal of theory, but makes no connection to real world economics. This book is a disappointment at such a high price."
2,"Not Functional, Cheaply Made","I bought this item for general decorating and picture hanging use.I'm really displeased. You have to put a whole in the wall just to use it, which I supposed I could get over.HOWEVER... If you already have a nail-hold and you need to install another one at the same level, the level will barely hang another one.I ended up just using my 5 dollar Walmart laserless level.I'm pretty annoyed with this product."
1,Poor excuse for a laser level!,"A poor excuse for a laser level! And, mentioned NOWHERE on the Black & Decker packaging, the way ""you"" will ""get"" it to adhere to a wall in order for you to use it, will be to take the compass disk (included), attach it to the bottom of the laser housing, then PUSH the entire contraption INTO YOUR DRYWALL via an extraordinarily sharp pin/nail, which protrudes from the bottom of the compass disk. OUCH!"
2,Level lines but hard to stick to wall,"The laser level part works perfectly. However, attaching it to the wall doesn't work too well. The pin that's provided with the laser level sucks and leaves big holes in the wall. I ended up using some double-sided tape to hold it to the wall. That worked pretty well."
4,"Well, nice and cheap",Very good tool. The only remark is that to place it on the wall to measure some level you have to open a hole in the wall because they hold with nail-shaped.
2,Barely Adequate for Even Simple Jobs,"There are two problems with the bubble levels in the BDL220S. First, the black indicator lines in the bubbles are too far apart, compared to the bubble size, making the device terribly inaccurate. Second, the bubbles are overly sensitive. I find this device nearly useless and regret purchasing it."
2,Where is the case?,"Photo shows it along with a case, no case delievered with product. Very sneaky advertising product this way. Don't like being lied to"
1,A corruption of christian beliefs.,"This book contain's the christian belief system, if you could call it a system. Need I say more?"
3,Good rechargeable light,"Used for a couple years, mainly only the flashlight. Purchased in 2005 and flashlight just quit working a couple months ago. Do not see where bulb or battery can be replaced. All other functions still work I would assume."
4,Rechargable Power Source,"Power source is good, power outage locator light works well, radio works well, the flashlight is slightly too light compared to the rest of the unit."
3,Weather Band doesn't work,"I haven't tried using any of the feature in an emergency but the light and flashlight seem like a good idea. Ran a test on the radio and found that I couldn't get anything on the weather band , just static. I returned the unit and received a replacement in 2 days. But the weather band didn't work on the new unit either . Seems like there is a design flaw here. Maybe a different antenna is needed for the weather band."
2,a dated emergency appliance,I purchased this unit about 6 months ago for about 85.00 for emergency purposes. It arrived and I plugged it in and forgot about it. I lost power and tried to use the 12 volt source to power a cell phone and it didn't work. Oh well! Amazon replaced the product but.... There are better ways to prepare for emergencies and I would suggest you look for another product.I also saw it advertised on Amazon later for about 49.00. Oh well! I felt like I got duped.
5,B&D Storm Station,It looks like a winner! Living in Florida having a dependable emergency light source and/or radio are a necessity. I trust the B&D name. I tried to buy the Storm Station locally but no one had them in stock. I found them at Amazon AND they were over $30 less than any one else.
1,Not for actual emergencies,"This is a toy for picnics and occasional short-term (30 minute) power outages. DO NOT bet your safety on the ""StormStation."" Shop around. There are far more reliable and practical products for the money. In the meantime, Black & Decker should either discontinue this product or sell it for a vastly-reduced price with a disclaimer that it is not for actual emergencies.Again, DO NOT bet your or your family's safety on this product."
3,Not Bad but limited!!,Not bad for $39.77 It is a neat little gadget. Will it get you through a power outage? NO it will not but it will make it more bearable. The light is not sufficient-You cannot read by it. You will be able to move around the room though without bumping into things. The chargers are fine. The radio is bad-bad reception and no weather channels. The flashlight is decent but not very powerful. More or less a toy. If you have a power outage you should have a large power inverter or generator so you can run your refrigerator and a few other appliances. Is it worth 39 dollars? Probably-I am satisifed for that price but would definitely not pay more.
1,B&D Stormstation,Never found out how well the battery backup worked since I returned the unit a few days after receiving it. The WB and TV Band 2 picked up virtually no signal at all. A Stormstation which cannot pick up the weather band seemed rather useless.
2,A good doorstop or paperweight,"This is not dependable in a storm. The light indicating that it is fully charged does not come on EVER. The outlets which would be great for charging a cell phone do not work. It is also an eyesore. The flashlight works. At first, the radio worked. I do not keep it plugged in all the time as I had in the past, so unless I know a storm is coming well in advance, this does not help at all."
1,Bad customer service!,DO NOT BUY A BLACK & DECKER STORM STATION! Critical parts such as the flashlight are no longer available. Black & Decker expresses zero concern about their total lack of customer parts service. Black & Decker is off my shopping list forever. Don't buy from a company who cares not one iota about customer service and satisfaction.
1,Black & Decker Stormstation,"After having survived 5 days with no water, heat nor electricity, I was very disappointed to find the Black & Decker Stormstation outlet was only strong enough to charge a cellphone--and that took overnight. It would not operate a toaster oven or even a coffee maker. I felt I was ripped off with total misrepresentation!"
2,Not as handy as I thought it would be.,My husband got this from me for Christmas. He said he would rather have a generator because this doesn't do what he would need it to do. He took it back & paid more for a generator.
1,worked for 12 months,Given that this is meant to provide back up service in case of an emergency you'd expect it to be reliable.It failed after 1 year of service. In other words after a year of sitting around do nothing. It now does even less
3,Very poor reception,"Looked at several of this style radio and chose to buy this one at about 3X the price about a year ago. I am satisfied with allmost everything except the reception of all bands.The stations keep fading requiring constant retuning every few minutes, Evan the strong stations.The tuner knob turns rather hard also.Other features are as described"
2,Not as useful as purported,"We bought several of these for gifts for the holidays, but when using the one we got for ourselves a couple of issues became obvious. Primarily, it's not as ""set it and forget it"" as it should be. Once the battery is fully charged, you are then supposed to uplug it and turn it off -- which makes its automatic ""find me"" light pointless. If you know in advance that the power is going to go out, it might be OK, but then how is that different from having to get some flashlights and candles ready?Secondly, it's construction reminds me of a child's fireman toy.It has its uses, but these design oversights prevent me from actually recomending the product."
3,B & D Storm Station,You can replace most of the functions of this unit with a flashligt and battery charger at a much lower cost.
4,Bob's B&D Storm Station,"The order was filled prompty, the item arriving shortly thereafter. The storm station was as described, meeting all my expectations."
5,Black and Decker Storm Station,This is the most incredible Storm weather station I have found. Every home should have one of these in their homes. A terrific buy.
5,Black & Decker Storm Station,"This is an amazing product. It is the greatest item to have in the house ready-to-use whenever you lose power. It is very comforting to know that you have it available whenever necessary. Being ""in the dark"" during a storm or ""blackout"" can be extemely stressful. This item really helps make a difficult situation a lot easier."
1,Packaging Fail,"Well, I was looking forward to seeing this show but it was not to be. This dvd comes in biodegradable, recycled, kind to dolphins, designed by bong smoker packaging that holds on to the dvd so tightly that it proved impossible to get out without breaking the dvd. I have never broken a dvd before. I tried to be careful but when the package finally gave up it's contents it could only do so by cracking the dvd from one side all the way to the hole in the middle. Bloody hippies!"
1,"""Understanding""??","I doubt anyone will understand futures markets after reading this book... I got it only because it was required for the class and I don't like the way the material is presented, the book is very confusing, there are not enough of problems and even those few that are there are too simplistic. Before my exam I beleive I learnt the book by heart and it didn't help me at the actual exam... I wouldn't recommend this text book!"
3,Light on Taste,"This book will be of interest to those who seek short histories of the various Scotch distilleries and photographs (nicely done) of the bottles and their labels. I was dissapointed by the shallow tasting notes, my real interest in buying this book.History and photographs can also be found in Michael Jackson's book of a similar title, but he also provides fantastic insight into the complex flavors of a stunning *800* different single malt Scotch Whiskies. If you only plan to read 2 or 3 books on the subject of Scotch Whisky, pass on this book and search out Michael Jackson or Charles MacLean, two highly respected Scotch Whisky experts and exceptional writers on the subject."
5,Pays for itself!,"The patterns on the disk are very usable. You can import these into Photoshop, resize them, create tiled images from the originals, then use them as backgrounds, patterns, masks on displacement psd files.If you like a pattern but don't like its colors, play around with overlaying the same pattern over itself in a separate layer using different overlay effects, and use Photoshop's various adjustment layers (hue/saturation and/or color balance). You'll get what you want.I have found this book and CD to be very valuable. Patterns range from Victorian to Indian, Islamic and Native American. I'd like to see a second edition to get even more patterns, but for the price of this item, you get a lot of value."
1,Dead on arrival,"I liked the shape, size and colors when I ordered the item. It wasn't available immediately, so after a few weeks of waiting the box finally arrived. The tub has 4 separate inflatable compartments. 2 of these were leaking air. This was obvious immediately after I inflated them. I also confirmed the exact locations by submerging the tub under water. The holes where close to the seams. These were not lacerations, but rather results of bad manufacturing process. As much as I hate solid plastic tub because of fear that it will scratch the tub surface, I think I have no choice."
3,Leaky tub,"I bought this for my son and it lasted about 40 days (just after the 30 day return policy), the darn thing leaked when I received the first one and the replacement lasted about 40 days before it started leaking in two places. All in all my son enjoyed it while it worked."
1,DID NOT LIKE!,RATING-100......IN ABOUT THE FIRST 5 MINUTES; the language and context were awful! Should have a different rating. Switch it out for a better movie. Thanks
5,A walk with Spirit through landscapes impossible to imagine.,"To clinically analyze the gift of music given us by Mr. Stagg is to insult the man and the music. Dream Spiral is a journey of Spirit, transcending time and space and allowing the inner being to experience a freedom and light never felt before. This is not music, it's magick... a match to light the fire of Spirit within us all, while quieting the noisome mind."
5,Best Album Ever Made!,"This album blew my mind away when it was first released in the summer of 1993! I was in Maine and listened to Island Sweets for the first time from the radio station called The Breeze (a sister station of The Wave of LA). I immediately went to several record stores and finally found one in a small town of Brunswick! I played that CD all summer long and it took me away into another level. Believe me I was in fantasy land with his music! You must buy this and listen to Spirit Dancers, Island Sweets (hit single), Drifting Toward a Dream, Dream Spiral (A REAL CLASSIC!) and Sunlight Returns (my personal favorite). You will NOT be disappointed with this CD! I promise you! Dream on!"
3,Think twice before getting this,This software is pretty good. Usually this works okay. It does have cool effects. The reason I gave it a three is sometimes it get messed up. Like if you have two buttons close together they overlap. Then if you hit one button it actually hits the other one.
3,The Ghost of Camp Ka Nowato,this story ain't dat good cuz i haven't read it all yet....and i think its gonna be good cuz it started out w/ a good intro.
4,Help for People with Diabetes,"I was diagnosed with diabetes just two weeks ago. The dietician at our local hospital introduced me to this book. It is a wonderful resource for tracking consumption of carbohydrates. I look forward to using this book on a daily basis. It is easy to understand and contains volumes of information, for a very small price."
5,Kitty uses it - no problem,"Believe it or not, I bought one of these, and it actually does solve the litter problem. Most of the mats I looked at seem to have tough bristles, and I figured my cat would just jump over the mat. The surface of this mat is actually kind of smooth, and clearly my cat walks over it because litter accumulates in the pan below, which is very easy to empty (just pour it out). Me and my cat recommend this product."
4,Better than a couple of bricks,"THese bookends are doing the job for me right now. There's not much to them. In fact I felt a little like a sucker when I unpacked them because they're just a couple pieces of bent steel (or something). Then I thought about it, and I decided that I'd rather have someone else find and bend the steel, because I have no idea how to do that kind of stuff. I'd probably make a big mess, ruin my steel (or whatever), leave it in the middle of the room, and then just use extra-large cans of beans (or bricks or something)as bookends. THese bookends are worth the price, and actually much more effective than beans."
2,Don't Really Work,I bought these to put on my daughters dresser to hold up her board books. I found that they really don't work all that well and are flimsy. They are constantly falling over and cannot hold the books without using double sided tape on the bottom prongs. I would not recommend buying these.
2,Cheap,"I guess they are worth the price, but don't really even hold my infant daughter's little books up. I will take one out and they all fall. Kind of defeats the purpose. Didn't pay that much for them though..."
3,a fairly good product,Bookends work well and are stylish. Minor imperfections in black finish. Just a bent piece of painted black metal with no padding/rubber underneath. I would buy this item again.
1,Just a piece of junk,"Totally a waste of time and money, the product can Never hold my books even if there are only 7 textbooks between them! Always fell apart when I pull out one book even if I have tried my best to do it very slightly! So don;t waste your money on this junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Too light weight for most books,"These were smaller than I expected, and they're super light. This makes them not very useful for holding up heavy books. I have some small books I can use them for so they'll do the job for me, but just don't expect them to support much weight. Even with lighter weight books, if you pull out the book on the very end, the book next to it falls agains the book end, and it will simply push the book end down the end of the shelf allowing all your books to fall.That said, these would be much better if they were made out of a heavier weight metal."
1,Zero Stars Not Available,This is a useless product. It is very pretty and sleek but tips at the slightest touch along with the books it's supposed to be holding. Do not buy.
2,A little too small,Good idea I suppose.. but these don't really support books that well. Especially if you use them to contain books on each side (rather than using a side wall of a book case for support). They work.. but delicately. I can't remove one book from the middle without all the others starting to lean. These would work better if they were a little bigger and heavier.
2,"Too Much Electronic, less feeling","I have to say that I've got very disappointed with this debut of the new Cherone's tribe. Even though, Cherone is a good singer, songwritter and performer, and the band have two great guitar players on the crew, it's sounds too much electronic, industrial, sometimes it doesn't sound rock, but seems like one of that new metal bands from eMpTyV, like Linkin Park, for example. It doesn't have the feeling and the beat of a real rock band, like Van Halen (witch I love!), Led Zeppelin, etc. It also have good moments, like the outstanding open track ""Left for Dead"", the almost progressive tunes ""No One"" and ""Thanks for Nothing"" and the Queen-based final track title ""Exit Elvis"". For those who looks for great hard rock songs, forget it, but for those who likes the new metal and only good guitar solos, I recommend."
3,OK,"Gary Cherone's voice, as always, is excellent on this CD. However, it's not enough for me to recommend someone should buy it. While the songs aren't bad, they're not breaking any new ground either. You've heard it all before by other bands, including Extreme.One track in particular completely takes away from the CD. It's the one where a young girl recites some poetry. She must be a relative.I recently saw them at the Paradise in Boston and they sounded great live. Only 2 problems: the best song performed was the Who's ""Can You See the Real Me"" as an encore (Cherone sounded better than Daltry), and the most interesting song (the title song!!) on the CD wasn't played.Regarding the title song, as interesting as it is, it's marred by this horrible female vocalist who sounds like every tinny voiced singer singing Memories at every wedding. She must be another relative.Hopefully the next CD will have some more originality, and less family."
4,Great book for 4-6 year olds!,"Amazon lists this book as being for 9-12 year olds, but it is intended for much younger readers. The editorial review states ages 3-6, which is more accurate. My daughter just started reading it and she's 6. She loves it! I'd say age 3 might be pushing it, since these are longer stories with fewer pictures, but a child with a good attention span and the ability to listen will enjoy them."
2,item needs more thorough description,"I bought this flag pole because it was small, looked nice and has a cap on it. What I didn't know is the anti-furl plastic sleeving is made to fit a 2x3 flag with a sleeve pole. I have already purchased the wrong flags for this pole and can't return them. I'm disappointed a better explanation wasn't given for what flags can be used on this pole. A 3x5 with grommets (or sleeving) looks horrible on this pole because you have to rig a fastener for the bottom, and the anti-wrap sleeving is not useable.It's a great pole and a great deal as long as you are able to accommodate it's limited capacity."
1,Fell apart,"My child enjoyed the doctor's kit, but the doctor ""tools"" started falling apart not long after he received it. The sewing came undone and smaller pieces fell off the tools and I was concerned about them being choking hazards. I contacted Alma's Designs and they told me they would replace our toy, but I never heard from them again. Their products and their customer service are both less than satisfactory."
1,Not what I expected,"This compilation does not contain titles of real hit movies. It contains mostly sentimental or comic songs from old movies and even from the ones I managed to recognise only a handful were original. It struck me hard to find ""Enae Volare"" from ""Les Visiteurs"", the only title I ordered this compilation for, terribly altered but that might concern me alone. Finding ""What a Feeling"" from ""Flashdance"" similarly altered made me wonder... later, on the back of the box, I found a small note saying, as I could decrypt from French, that the songs in the album were not necessary original. I should've been warned about this in advance!"
5,Oustanding Historical Overview of Cinema Musicology,Outstanding Historical Overview of Cinema Musicology in a mega collection of greats! A wonderful gift for babyboomers who want to savor movie sountracks of their all time favorites.
5,"Lush, Feather Light Harp Music","Feather Light (1989) is just about the most beautiful recording of instrumental harp music you can find. Accompanied by an ensemble including guitar, violin, keyboards, dobro, and percussion, the sound is lush and lives up to its title as ""Feather Light."" You will find yourself listening to this album whenever you need a quiet moment, need to slow down for a bit, or just want to crash and float away to an imaginary destination filled with lush, soothing harp tones. Hint to a potential buyer: any of Hilary Stagg's albums are awesome productions and you really can't go wrong with buying any of them. Though Hilary Stagg died unexpectedly several years ago, his vision of life can vividly be remembered through his music."
3,I have a mixed review,"I used this book for the first time today. I made the recipe for the Chili Powder and I used the Chili Powder to make the recipe for Enchilada Sauce #1.Both recipes turned out well.For the Chili Powder it called for 6oz of dried chili pods. I used 2oz ea of New Mexico and Guajillo and 1oz each of Ancho and California. I thought it turned out good.I agree with one reviewer (the person who gave it only 1 star) that her measurements are off. The Author says that the recipe for the chili powder makes 2/3 cup of finished product. It was more like 2 cups. Just the other seasonings without the chilies comes out to 7 tablespoons and THAT's almost a 1/2 cup.And the recipe for the enchilada sauce says that it makes 1 1/4 cups of finished sauce. I don't know how you take a recipe that calls for 2 cups of water and seasonings and only simmer it for 5 minutes (covered) and get 1 1/4 cups of sauce. It was more like 2 cups.That all being said, I was happy with the turn out of both recipes."
2,Not authentic!,"If you are looking for an AUTHENTIC Mexican Cook Book, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!!!! This is a mediocre, simple and flavorless cookbook. I'm Mexican, and I know it's cuisine. Look at the other 2 and 3 star ratings, and I agree with them. This is like a Taco Bell, Del Taco type of food. I hope no one gets offended by this, but this is what I call, ""White Mexican Food""."
2,disappointed,"This book has very limited Mexican food. The recipes are poor, as are the directions. I suggest trying a different book."
2,Disappointed,"Shipping was quick and it was packaged in cute little round ring box with green bow.However, the color of the stone is a light yellow, not the honey champagne color depicted on the webpage. The size 5 I ordered is more like a 6.5, way too big! It's too expensive to return because of shipping costs.Very disappointed."
5,Beautiful Ring,"I purchased this to wear as a cocktail ring and it is beautiful! It's not too large or too small, just right. I'm very picky about ring and stone size, but this was nearly perfect. The stone setting lies on your finger, so you can't very easily wear it with another ring (or a band)."
1,"Disappointed, but will try their product again","The setting was bent, the stone was cocked /crooked at a funny angle,it just appeared cheap (yes I know it is cheap) but I expected more for $20 sumthin... but I am going to try them again and order synthetic citrine earrings, I love gemstones and don't mind fakes, as long as they look like quality."
5,Beautiful ring,"I love this ring so much. I mainly bought it cause im sick of fake jewlery and this is far from fake. I love how it shines and my my and look pretty and it's my boyfriends birthstone so it reminds me of him. It's my favorite piece of jewlery and i can wear it with anything, and i get so many compliments on it. Glad i bought it"
5,I wouldn't trade it for the world!,"I have to say this ring is now my favorite out of all my jewelry. I searched the internet for two months looking for a anything citrine, found this ring and fell in love with it. Fast shipping. No complaints at all."
5,"very, very habit forming music",I first bought this album some 20 years ago and have had to buy it several more times. everytime I would play it the album would come up missing. Since I moved Tijers New Mexico everyone who has heard it has bought the CD. It is by far a classic.
5,This One DEFINES Classic!,"It is impossible to break a review of Arlo's 'Last Of The Brooklyn Cowboys' down song by song. This one is a continuous flowing joy from beginning to end. IF there was such a thing as a best Arlo recording, then this one would be it. Hands down. Especially when he takes on a Dylan tune, in this case 'The Gates Of Eden'. The sound is excellent, the backup musicians are perfect. With that said, let the praise continue. Arlo is here to stay, folks! Now...where the heck is Alice, anyways?..."
3,Good for a showing...,"Mildly entertaining, yet good enough to watch it to the end.And the ending leave enough room for a sequel or will it be a new tv series ?.Looks like the movie was made for good looking people as theguys and girls in this movie all look good and rich... Movie started witha rock soundtrack...yuck.. and is pretty well directed with some greatlocation shots. Save your money...rent it."
1,Digi-Balls,"Buncha young, half-naked male hotties throw digi-balls around at each other cuz, dude, they're abusin' the power of the Ipswitch ... I mean, there's a power from the past that they tapped into, and ... Um, who the f--k cares. This movie sucks. If I want to see naked guys, I'll look at gay porn. I like my horror to come with a brain."
1,This movie was meant for TV and is another reason why Hollywood sucks,"Good effects, very attractive cast, bad acting, bad writing, and extremely tiring to watch.I never get tired of a cool action scene but the ones in this movie go for too long.It's silly and as predictable as a white sheet of paper."
1,omg,i bought this movie when it first came out and got around to watching it i could have waited forever.This has to be the worst movie i have ever watched in my life.They forgot to write a story and do anything special with the special affects.They took a good idea for a movie and dropped the ball big time.do not buy this movie its a waste of time i want the 97 minutes of my life back i spent watching this turd.No there is nothing it its thats good
3,eh,Like many of the movies i rented on here it was for a class. The movie wasn't good but it wasn't terribly bad either. Still if it hadn't been for a class I never would have spent money on it.
5,Great Movie,"If you are a fan of history, horror, and suspense this movie ties it all in, it gives you a little history, makes your skin crawl a little, and keeps you on the edge of your chair."
3,Medicore at best,"To be completely honest, after going off of a Friday Night Lights binge I was trying to find everything that might include a little bit of Taylor Kitsch. I found his portrayal of Riggins to be amazing, and his range of acting made me want to see more.While this movie didn't fail in casting some seriously good looking guys (and putting in a gratuitous swimming scene that involved speedos), the rest of it kind of failed for me. I'm a huge fan of supernatural/paranormal movies/literature so I was excited to see that Kitsch was included in something like this. But the script was just...ridiculous. It seemed like the movie could have been great, there were decent effects and an interesting story line, but the way it was executed was just plain ole' corny. If you're looking to have an hour and a half of pretty faces, it's good. But if you're looking to be entertained, or see any sort of arc, it's kind of disappointing."
4,The Covenant was...,"This was just a solid and entertaining flick. I'm not saying it's a film on par with Citizen Kane, but you can get your popcorn ready and at least have fun. It was based on a comic book, which was specifically developed for a film adaptation. Good stuff all around."
1,"Awful, Just Awful","I would give this piece of crap movie no stars if I could. I purchased this movie thinking it was going to be nice and scary. Boy was I wrong! This movie takes forever for the main storyline to take off and never properly introduces you to anything in the film. This is a teen flick with hot guys taking their shirts off and going after the girls but nothing more. If you like teen sex movies, well this is for you. This movie is 110% not recommended."
5,The Covenant,"I had never heard of this movie until my son told me about it. He knows how much I loved Twilight so he thought I would like it. No, it's not about vampires. It's in a class of it's own. I loved this movie. I've watched in five times so far. It is great."
2,Hot straight male witches with no real acting or story line.,"My title says it all, really! IMDB the guys if you like what you see, buy it only for eye-candy appeal - alone!"
2,Ever see a movie that is so bad that it is good?,"... me neither. That sure doesn't apply to this one. This movie is simply a bad movie. I gave it two stars instead of one because this one is just barely watchable, mainly because of the cute girls in it. Other than this, this movie is basically a bunch of good-looking girls being chased by good-looking guys. Oh, somewhere in there there is some stupid plot about families who are really witches or something like that. But mostly this is just a bunch of teenagers mouthing corny lines that you have heard before in other horror flicks.I would call this one a guilty pleasure except it is not that much of a pleasure."
4,The Covenant,I have to say this movie wasn't as bad as others were saying it to be. I think it was an awesome movie if you love witchcraft and action and fighting movies. I love the story and believe this is a great movie for younger teens.
4,Good story..,Enjoyable movie..reasonably good plot and well acted movie. Great Halloween change of pace. Attractive cast that was well directed and moves at a good pace
3,NOT a movie to be taken seriously!,"This is a movie for watching with your girlfriends while eating ice cream and wishing you were having sex with someone instead of watching a stupid movie. The acting is mediocre at best, the story line is written like they didn't even try, and it really is quite laughable. BUT, if you want to have fun watching a movie, not to mention getting some seriously superficial man-candy in, this is a great pick. It's just fun, even more so if you're watching with friends (I recommend putting it on mute and dubbing it over with your own dialogue, it'd probably be better than the actual movie anyway.). DON'T expect a good movie, just an enjoyable one with a lot of hot guys and pretty ok special effects."
1,For the love of God...NO!,"This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever seen at the theaters. The Mummy was bad, but this one was much worse! Witch boys flying around in a black SUV? Oooohhh, scary! What the hell is a darkling anyway? The acting was horrible, the special effects were cheesy. You might as well sit at home and watch 2 hours worth of Charmed. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Tomandandy were the same masterminds behind the awesome music in the remake of The Hills Have Eyes. The songs by Rob Zombie and other metal bands were good too. This movie kind of makes me think of Darkness Falls. Not sure why, it just does. Maybe because they were supposed to be so good and just flopped around like a fish out of water until they died. I just wanna end on this note, the best part of the movie was when the closing credits began to run."
3,Entertaining,"Though this movie isn't exactly an award-wining epic or a piece of cinematic excellence, it is extremely entertaining and a perfect piece of escapist fantasy. The story line is very good as well as the special effects and the cinematography. The main actors are delightful to look at as long as you don't judge them on their acting ability. This movie won't make you question the meaning of life, but it will provide you with a few hours of entertainment."
4,Review of product.,Have seen the movie several times. I like the movie but I bought it for my son. Movie came within the timeframe that was stated had no problems with the movie. I would buy from this seller again.
3,Recommended for Smallville serial fans,"Other people have mentioned about the movie's story etc. therefore I will skip that part. People generally look to this section to get a sort of ""peer recommendation"" so lets move quickly to that. This movie is worth:4 star if your are a MALE TEENAGER interested in SUPERNATURAL/SUPERPOWER movies. You will love this movie if you already love SMALLVILLE serial.2-3 star if you are a FEMALE TEENAGER interested in watching some COOL BOYS but let me warn you you might get quickly bored...3 star if you are a movie-goer interested in SUPERNATURAL/SUPERPOWER stuff, it will give you some apetite about what you are looking for but it is not going to satisfy you, for sure...2-3 star if you are into ADVENTURE MOVIES, probably you might find better movies that you still have not seen...0-1 star if you are none of the above."
3,Entertaining,"This movie wasn't what I would call a ""blockbuster hit"", but it was enjoyable to watch. The special effects are amazing, but the storyline could use some work. The plot jumps around a bit and was hard to follow the first time. This movie is about a group of four families who during the Salem witch hunts, formed a covenant of silence to protects themselves. There was a fifth family orginally, but the family was exhiled from the covenant. The movie mostly takes place in modern times and describes basically how the last remaining member of the fifth family tries to get revenge. Not the best movie I've seen recently, but fun to watch."
3,Having powers makes you sweaty.,"Not an awful movie. The effects were a little repeated from the Underworld movie but didn't detract from the overall picture. Did a small amount of stealing from the movie Lost Boys too, but only someone who obsessed over that movie as a pre-teen would know that.It definitely doesn't have adults in mind. But has a high repeat watchablity factor. Unlike others who didn't like this movie, I got exactly what I expected and was pleased.BTW, what is with all the perspiration?? Having powers must make you leaky. OR...it wasn't apart of the movie but a result of the steroid abuse (I saw those shoulder stretch marks They can't deny it)"
1,Ridiculous.,"I went to see this movie without having heard anything about it beforehand. In the first scene I was expecting it to be a horror movie. It isn't that. I'm not exactly sure what it is. The words that come to mind are ""ridiculous"" ""far-fetched"" ""poorly acted"" and ""stupid plotline."" This movie is all a mimic of a whimsical, enchanting idea that was horrible scripted and portrayed. The actors are unbelieveable and are terrible actors. Especially the antagonist.Only see this if you are with a group of friends who have a good sense of humor. This is not to be watched seriously. Make fun of it brutally for me please."
2,please!!!!!!!!,"i could have watched the wb, or cw...whatever it's like charm meats 7th heaven meets one tree hill.........terrible"
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,if you are looking for a movie to sleep through it is then a good movie for you. it is so boring. it tags you on and on. and the final fight scene is still boring.
3,:0),Not a bad movie i think was too busy watching the guys yummy when they are together.. But for real was watchable a little predictable but still watchable.
3,Not that bad...,"I read some previous reviews that blabbed away the plot, so I almost didn't watch. ""The Covenant had some good action right from the start, and there were a few creepy moments. Populated by a very attractive cast, and directed by Renny Harlin, I was entertained (apparently) more than most."
5,Loved it!,"I loved this movie from the start to finish, I loved the movie The Craft and this one topped it hands down. It's got action, suspense and a little romance and humor it's perfect."
2,bore city!,"WHOA!THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY CORNY! ONLY ONE PERSON GETS KILLED IN THIS MOVIE, DO I HEAR BOO ANYONE! THE WHOLE FIGHT SEQUENCE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WAS REALLY LAME! ALL THEY HAD WAS THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS THOWRING INVISIBLE ENERGY BALLS AT EACH OTHER LIKE THEY WERE PLAYING THE OLD 1992 HIT VIDEO GAME (STREET FIGHTER 2). THE SO CALLED MAGIC IN THIS MOVIE KINDA REMINDED YOU OF THE MOVIE (THE CRAFT). JUST LIKE ONE OF MY FELLOW REVIEWERS SAID, IT WAS A LOT OF MALE BONDING IN THIS FLICK! BUT TO THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS FILM,DON'T FEEL BAD,THE SO CALLED VILLAN DID NOT DIE,SO THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A SEQUEL!"
1,Laughable,"When taking a first glance at the Covenant, it's not hard to see how bad a film this truly is. Directed by Renny Harlin, who once showed a promising career with Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea, and the Long Kiss Goodnight; but has faltered as of late with recent fiascos like Exorcist: The Beginning and Mindhunters; the Covenant revolves around a group of descended male witches who look as if they just walked out of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. Their posh lifestyle is threatened to come to an end when an adversary rears his head, or something like that. The Covenant is one of those films that you just wonder how it got made. Harlin's action set pieces are just plain sloppy and uninspired, making one wonder if this really is the same guy who brought us the aforementioned films. As for the rest of the film, including the atrocious acting, lame CGI effects, and overuse of thunder and lightning effects; well, you get the idea. Don't waste your time."
2,Dragonball Z + yuppies + $20mil = steaming pile of dung. (stupid censorship on amazon),"basically its a b movie that was made with a list price.4 rich guys with super powers contend with some other yuppie who wants their powers. that's about it. nothing else, or even that, is remotely interesting.the rich warlocks go around using their powers for anything, which btw, every time they use them they grow prematurely older. which perfectly explains why they use them for trivial things, such as lock picking, and car maintenance (which includes front windshield repair.) sure its addictive, but still is nonsense.reminds me of merlin's shop of horrors.o the dragon ball energy ball fights were freaking amazing. not good amazing, but i almost fell out my chair laughing amazing.luckily i bought it from a bargain bin ($5). but its not really worth that price. not memorable, and coasters come in better styles."
1,Non-magical,"Touted as the new millenium's The Lost Boys, this movie is undeserving of such comparison. The soundtrack is smashing and the actors are all good-looking, but there is no witty dialogue or humorous subplots. The special effects are decent, but are more reminiscent of a high budget show (Heroes, The Dresden Files) than of a movie. About the best thing this movie has going for it is a one-line joke about Harry Potter."
1,Absolute rubbish,Oh my god I cannot believe I spent a few of my hard earned pennies watching this film!!! Bunch of pretty boys with special powers...well err could start your car with scary red eyes lol! Oh and did I mention what an utter rip off of Lost Boys it was? Dont waste your cash
2,Alot of hot people... but the movie it self blew.,Yesss.... lots and lots of really hot people.. but the move sucked.
1,No......no it wan't good.,"First off, Laura Ramsey is not a Highschool girl and could not be confused for 18/19. She is a young twenty something in this movie and she has the smoking hot body to prove it. The plot was lacking, there was little to no witchcraft, and the acting from the others left one wanting. They had a good plot base and failed to expound on it, all I can think is that the movie was cheesy to the point where I felt I had waisted my time."
1,The Covenant is Twilight before Twilight.,The Covenant is simply a horrid movie that will truly only appeal to the Twilight crowd if you want a vastly better series go watch the Harry Potter saga its dark and mature storytelling is what fantasy should truly be.
2,"The Convenant is no ""Lost Boys""","This movie aspires to be a current ""Lost Boys"" but the acting is not on the par of Sutherland and Haim. Although it is watchable I found myself wanting to fast forward through a couple points wanting it to get more interesting. The storyline of Warlocks and Witches with magical powers living around one of the old colonizing areas is not new. There take on it wasn't bad, just not original. The acting was fair but not good or outstanding. So overall if you enjoy this type movie I highly recommend you rent it before dropping any money on it. Good quality DVD with very low replayability."
2,CG & WIRE TRICKS,"A typical movie about wizards in the modern day, not to shabby, if you have already seen the following movies: WARLOCK, PROPHECY & the MTV edited Korean flick VOLCANO HIGH.The director and his guys makes it sound like this is the first time a movie like this was ever made, c'mon, I admit the tricks were executed neatly in the final production, but, the tricks are no longer new. Okay, the wires used for this movie are computerized, I guess the crew are too lazy to hoist the actors or the stuntmen?Here is my comparison of this movie with the 3 movies I've mentioned:WARLOCK: The idea of wizards and druids that still exist, supposedly, in our time today. Super-Human Powers, the lifting, flying and the fight scenes.PROPHECY: The All-Dark-Eyes trick, Super-Human Powers, the lifting, the flying and the fight scenes.VOLCANO HIGH: Camera Angles, CG and Wire Tricks, Super-Human Powers, the lifting, the flying and the fight scenes."
5,great plugs,"I really don't feel that specific spark plug designs can make much difference in normal driving - it's really a matter of keeping everything in good tune. However, I had heard people talking very positivly about these plugs. It turns out that NGK DOES NOT show a V-power plug for my '93 Saturn, so I had to improvise by looking at the standard plug they DO sell and figuring out the code for the corresponding V-power version. The regular plug is ""BKR5ESA-11"" and knowing that the ""Y"" indicates V-power, I just decided I would order ""BKR5EYA-11"". They are identical except for the v-power groove. I just went on a long trip where I got over 40mpg on one leg of the trip."
1,Watch out!,"Gave Amazon the one star! This is suggested for the Birds choice purple martin house. IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE!!! Save yourself the trouble of ordering and returning -- and make sure it fits with the bird house that you order. Second time a ""suggestion"" from amazon turned out to be incompatible with the other item i purchased. Otherwise I'm sure it's a fine pole but luckily we tested the connection before we installed it."
1,No Birds,"Last Heath product I will ever purchase !!Not stable when fully extended ! Large sway at top where bird house is mounted .PLUS , LOCKING PINS broke when utilized .Will NOT be able to lower Bird House without cutting down poleI would return but , I can't get it down .Spend a little bit more ands get better quality !!"
2,15 foot Martin House pole,"About what I expected, the telescoping pole locks won't hold good. Ripoff for the price they charge, only reason I ordered it is because you can't buy a suitable pole locally. I just drill holes and put in bolts for the telescoping system. Also the suggestion for setting the pole about 18 inches deep is a laugher, needs to be at least 30 inches deep where I live."
2,was sent gourd pole not martin house pole,"When we received the pole it had to be ""adjusted"" with a hammer to make it fit inside center hold for the Martin house."
1,"poor design, poor instructions","We bought this pole to go with a martin house we purchased. The pole is fine but the locking system is terrible. We could not get the hook to work either upright or on the ground like some reviews indicated. We ended up using a metal drill and nuts and bolts. We drilled holes thru the pipe and then bolted the pipes together. this worked great. Now when it is time to clean, all we have to do is take out the bolts and lower the pole by sections. Design of the locking system needs to change."
3,Telescoping Martin House Pole Review,"The pole is great, but, the locking system is a joke. Be prepared to drill and pin the sections."
3,"Too soon to review, but...","I only just put the telescoping pole in the ground last night. Installation was simple enough and the pole seems sturdy. However, I cannot figure out the purpose of the black ground socket piece. Is that portion supposed to be in the ground? What the heck is itfor exactly? Instructions were not clear...If anyone can help me out on this, it would be greatly appreciated."
2,Terrible Locking System!!!!,The 'Easy Locking' system is probably the greatest misnomer on any product.Additionally like so many other consumers my pole had no markings indicating which end was which. You are expected to force and twist a curved bolt like piece of metal between the two poles in a small gap with little clearance.This requires two people at least and usually can only be done with the pole assembled and on the ground.This in turn makes it IMPOSSIBLE to actually telescope the pole without taking the whole system down to the ground.The pole seems sturdy enough but the locking system makes this less than useless for regular cleaning and maintaining a purple martin house.
3,"sturdy, but poor desigh.",When I clicked on the purple martin house to purchase it from Amazon a picture of the telescoping pole came up. It was suggested that this pole would be a great combination with the martin house I was buying. When it was time to put everything together we realized that the opening for the pole was triangle shape and the pole was round. My husband figured out a way to make it work. He wasn't pleased with the way the poles were to be connected. He thought that it had a poor design. The martin house and the pole have only been up for a few weeks but they have both withstood some heavy winds. Only time will tell if this will hold up due to the fact that this isn't the proper pole for our martin house.
1,This Book Is Full of Errors,"I gave this book one star because there was no option for giving it no stars. As a Roman Catholic I can say that if the Church taught half of what McCarthy says it does, I would have left years ago. McCarthy, despite his claim that he was a Catholic, does not present an accurate view of the teachings of the Catholic Church. It would be difficult to list the errors because he is wrong on almost every point. If you want to find out what the Catholic Church teaches, read ""The Catechism of the Catholic Church"" and avoid this book like the plague."
2,Neo-nestorianism,"This book rejects the Third Ecumenical Council, Ephesus. McCarthy unashamedly and explicitly announces his support for Nestorius, the heretic condemned by the Council.This sets McCarthy apart from many protestants who claim that they adhere to the first four Ecumenical Councils.McCarthy's (and Nestorius') error is a basic Christological one. Nestorius believed that Jesus was actually two distinct persons, Jesus the Man, and Jesus the Divine. This way they (Nestorius and his latter-day disciple) could avoid admitting that Mary is the ""mother of God"".Protestants who embrace McCarthy's book, yet claim to adhere to some form of ""catholic"" Christianity, are showing that they cherish their grudge against Rome more than they cherish the truth about Christ's Divine Personhood."
1,Not sure why this writer dislikes Catholics.,"Yeah, call this one the ""Gospel According to Jim"" or something like that. This author sees Catholicism through the eyes of the Plymouth Brethern movement, though he tries to hide that. His sect majors on the teaching of females wearing head coverings and not speaking at meetings of the sect where men are present. They also have a bias against scholarship, be it Catholic or Protestant. His bias against Catholicism comes out in a big way in this book, one of several publications this writer has that try to refute Catholicism. As noted by another reviewer, McCarthy is ably answered by Church apologist on the internet."
1,Another testament to ignorance,"What better way of finding out what Catholics REALLY believe than from an anti-catholic! If you want a neatly printed sophomoric collation of tired old anti-Catholic untruths, there are better books than this. Of course, if it's your wont, ignore authentic presentations of the Catholic faith (such as the Catechism), scripture, and many widely recognised explications of the Faith. The McCarthy's need a good dose of Scott Hahn videos and tapes to blow away the fust. Prayer will also help, since their ignorance is invincible, and their error so manifest. Yawn."
1,The Bible is a Catholic publication.,"Claiming that the Catholic Church doesn't believe in and misinterprets the Bible is like saying that the founding fathers of the United States didn't believe in the Bill of Rights and, in their later writings, misinterpreted it. That's just nuts. The Bible is a collection of books (""biblia"" is Greek for ""the books"") written over a 1500 year span (Genesis to Revelations) and was compiled by the Church: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.McCarthy is a well known and virulent anti-Catholic. Reading this book to gain a better understanding of Catholicism is like attending a Klan rally to gain a better understanding of race relations. If you're looking for an academic and unbiased understanding of the Catholic faith, look elsewhere."
2,Confusing and Uninspiring,"I am not writing this review out of animosity of the books supporters but it was like reading a foriegn language to me. And yes I have issues about some Catholic teachings before anyone accuses me of jumping on the defense. Regardless of religious denomination we must remember that our one access to the kingdom of heaven is Jesus Christ. We also need to understand that there are many Catholics who don't necessarily believe every single Catholic doctrine to the letter. For example, many Catholics at least question the existence of purgatory, the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the issue of works in relation to faith, and certainly the authority of the pope. My point is we can't judge someone's relationship to Jesus based on the name of their denomination. And we certainly can't judge all Catholics based on what the Vatican teahces. Anyone and everyone that has a relationship with Jesus Christ is already justified."
5,Critical examination of the Roman Catholic church,This book has an excellent presentation. It's critical of Roman Catholism and is written by a former catholic from a very catholic family. He uses real life situations to showcase Roman Catholic practices and references many Roman Catholic writings including the new Catechism of the Catholic church. Does a powerful comparision between Roman Catholic teachings and scripture. His judgment is obvious but not harshly given.
1,The Gospel According to Jim?,"Unfortunately, Catholic bashers will love this book and will probably flock to the book's and the writer's defense as they read this review. But beware; this writer is heavily influenced by the Plymouth Brethern sect/cult and his theological bias is hidden from the casual reader. McCarthy sets up straw men that are ably demolished by Catholic apologists on the web; check out these writers before you spend your hard earned cash on this unfair tract."
1,more anti-catholic claptrap,"I can't believe that I spent two nights reading this book. He fails to mention the apostolic tradition, fails to cite historical precidence, fails to mention the various councils, fails to mention the tenants of faith and did not accurately identify the eastern rites of the Catholic Church. All the author did was elaborate on the popular sound bites that are directed against the Catholic Church. In short this is just another hate book aimed at the Catholic Church.I only wish that I could have rated it below one star"
1,"James McCarthy establishes his own ""infallible interpretation""","A friend gave our family this book to read to convince us of the ""errors of the Catholic Church"".Well, it didn't work.Why should we trust this author's views on such issues as Baptism or the Eucharist over another? Is it because he states ""Well, the Bible says....""? There are plenty of Protestant authors (such as RC Sproul Jr.) who would disagree with his views on the two issues that I mentioned above. They follow ""only the Bible"" also.So who would be correct?McCarthy does a lot of prooftexting in this work which has only strengthend our belief that ""sola scriptura"" is unbiblical."
1,Common Anti-Catholic Propoganda,McCarthy trots out the same old protestant straw man arguments against the Catholic Church. It is funny when he quotes and denounces passages from the Catechism which are in themselves quotes of St. Paul. His writing is totem pole assaults against Catholicism which are based on sources that have been shown to be so out of line that no modern scholar gives them any weight.
1,"""Keatring"", ""Kreatings"", ""Kearing""???","Hope the reviewer, ""Giovanni"", can read better than he can spell... not once, not twice but three times he misspelled Karl Keating's name.I've been reading the Protestant's arguments to see if they've come up with anything new, because they just keep getting knocked down to the mat by the Catholic apologists. And it never fails to amaze me how much ignorance they can spew. After reading the review I commented on though, I'm starting to wonder if they're even literate. There just has to be some excuse for ignorance this widespread."
1,Garbage,"The author is either being dishonest with what he knows about Catholicism, is intellectually disabled, or has been around anti-Catholics for too long. As a cradle Catholic versed in Catholic apologetics, I don't recognize the Catholicism he writes about. I guess he achieved his goal. He feeds the fire of the ignorant and makes money while doing so."
1,thou shalt not commit false witness.,"I have never written a review, but this book was horrible. It quotes Catholic Sources out of context, and interprets what they say in horribly distorted ways. I cannot believe the author actually believes what he wrote. If you want to know about Catholicism, please do not read things written by people who hate the church and want to distort it. Read Catholic Sources to learn about the catholic church."
1,Clever but Inaccurate,"I have to give the author the fact that he presents clever arguments, but for anyone who has read the fathers he quotes, he is not very convincing. The men he quotes, the fathers of the Church and others, were faithful Catholics. Just as he takes the very Scriptures, the New Testament of which was made by the Catholic Church, and tries to use it against that Church.I found this book, like those of most other protestant apologists, utterly unconvincing. To try to prove that the Church actually did succumb early on to heresy is tantamount to saying that Jesus was sadly deceived when He said that ""The gates of hell shall not prevail against it."" (The Church)If you believe that Jesus abandoned His Church by the third century only to revive it with Martin Luther and thousands of conflicting denominations, this book is for you. Otherwise, come on home to Rome!"
5,Best examination of RC tradition vs. scripture,"Please read this book especially if you're roman catholic.It helps you understand the Bible as the final Word of God. The book also exposes ""human tradition"" (traditions of the RC church) as an obstuction to Christian theology.Great documentation from a former RC!"
5,I took my mom's book!,"This is a GREAT on-the-go cookbook. My mom let me borrow her copy and she never got it back! It's filled with lots of easy, quick recipes that I can always find the ingredients for already in my kitchen. I also care for two small boys, ages 3 and 6, who will actually eat from the recipes in this book. They're favorite--Nacho chicken on pg. 80. And the recipes are so simple that you can easily commit your favorites to memory. So, that's why I've come to this site. Mom's getting a new copy for Christmas!"
5,One of my favorite cookbooks,This cookbook is one of the best cookbooks I own. I love to buy cookbooks. I read them like I would a novel. These recipes are easy and practical. I would recommend this to everyone who needs to cook easy meals.
5,The only cookbook I use!!,"This was a gift from my mother, and I have tried MANY of the recipes-- all of which have been easy & delicious. My sister is addicted to hers as well, and I plan to buy another copy as a wedding gift."
5,MUST HAVE for every kitchen,"This was a gift to me from a friend that said YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS BOOK. She was right EVERY recipe I have tried has been a huge success and very easy and fast to make (I dislike cooking so easy was a must and I work long hours so fast was a plus as well). There are a lot of pictures, which is nice as I tend to only cook items with pictures. My entire family now has this book and it is a favorite in every household!!!"
5,Wonderful cookbook!,"I had lost this cook book in a recent move and just had to find another copy! The receipes in it are easy to fix, and don't take a lot of time to prepare. Great for a busy family!"
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"These recipes seem a little dated (think Grandma's casserole) and way too simple.Honestly, if you have basic cooking skills and know what flavors go well together, I'd skip this one. There are better cookbooks on the market. Plus, this book uses a LOT of canned soup, etc in its recipes, which isn't great for someone who prefers fresh ingredients. I've gotten maybe three good recipes out of here, which isn't worth the price tag for me."
5,The title says it all....,"This cookbook is full of quick easy recipes for those who dont have alot of time during the week to cook elaborate meals. Although some of the recipes will make it seem to others as if you spent more time than you did. About 90% of the recipes have pictures associated with it so you can see what your end result should look like. A couple of my favorites in this book include, easy enchiladas, oriental burgers, and nacho chicken. And for those who like dessert, might I suggest, easy brickle cake."
2,poor taste,"I love to make pudding for my family and to have my self. And this was the first try with this one and I was disappointed at the aftertaste. Not nearly as bad as the sugar-free chocolate, but I would not buy this again."
5,Great Tasting Sugar-Free Pudding - Highly Recommended,"Jell-O ""Sugar-Free Instant Pudding"" is a great snack! Since becoming a Type 2 diabetic last year, I am always looking for good tasting, low carb snacks.The Jell-O instant puddings are easy to make and taste so good that it is hard to tell it is a ""diet"" snack.Highly recommended!"
3,Not really cheesecake,"Well I'm gonna say it is pretty good, but doesn't taste like cheesecake. It taste more like yellow cake batter, but I am guilty of eating that whenever I make one. It also has a bit of a strange texture, after the first few bites you don't notice it as much."
2,Not a very good cheesecake taste...,"This Jello cheesecake mix is not nearly as tasty as their Sugar-Free Banana Cream mix (that one tastes like *real* banana cream!). This mix does not have the flavour of cheesecake, and also has a vague chemically taste."
3,"Good, but....","It doesn't taste like cheesecake. It tastes like yellow cake batter. Not a bad flavor, but not like cheesecake in the least. My sister said the same thing when she tasted it."
1,nothing like cheescake,"this tastes nothing like a real cheesecake not even close to what you would buy already made. my kids like it but as for me and my husband, we won't eat it again."
4,Modern Jazz/Rock,"Sweet Sweet Candy's ""Spinning"" picks up where Jazz Rock fusion of the 70's died. These musicians mix strong jazz themes over a solid rock & roll foundation. It is an absolute pleasure to hear saxophones in such a setting. Both sax players exude a strong ""Coltrane"" influence as soloists. At the same time they demonstrate the tight, intricate ensemble playing of Blood, Sweat & Tears or Chicago. The drums are presented with a very fat, funky techno rhythm. The bass and guitar complement the technical dexterity demonstrated by the rest of the ensemble. Overall, this is an exciting mix of material that will challenge serious listeners."
5,Great series!!!,"Very well written, lots of adventure and action, good clean Christian fiction. We highly recommend this for any age, but it is probably best for 4th through 8th grade readers."
1,Ooops?,"Have you confused the Chubby Jackson Quintet with the Jackson Five? Chubby Jackson recorded a title ""The Happy Monster"" C.1945."
4,Addicting stuff...,"I decided to check out Mr. Buckner on a whim since I saw he was coming to play at a local venue, and wow, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I've listened to this album about 4 times already and each time it gets better and better - though I still have absolutely no clue what he is singing about, but it isn't happy (and this is ok). This is overcome by the highly addictive riffs and the fast pace of the album. I forsee this becoming a fantastic night driving album. -All in all a very good find and I will recommend this to others!"
3,so so,I have other Winter Solstice CDs that I can't live withoutthis one didn't move me quite the same. good background musicduring Christmas in my dog grooming shop
2,Pendant is larger than expected,"The pendent was much larger than I expected it to be, and therefore makes for an awkward combination with the hemp. The ""clasp,"" as the other reviewers noted, is a real pain. It's not just a tie; it includes two separate, three-strand pieces one one side, and a small loop on the other. It's nearly impossible to push the six strands through the loop when you're holding the necklace in your hand, let alone when it's around your neck."
5,LOOKS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!,"I am getting this doll in three days... and i am totally exited!!! I am eleven years old... and i am so exited! if you have a 8 to 12 year old, and you are thinking about getting this doll, but you think she might be to old? well... i am eleven, and i cannot stop looking at pictures of her online!! my mother says it is smart to not think i am to old to play with dolls. she thinks it is stupid to think i am to old, when i am eleven! i even can't stop thinking about her!!! and i am not kidding!"
1,soooo loud !,"bought this for my daughter - she likes it but it's soooo loud, with no way of turning down the volume. When the arms and legs move (dancing) the sound of the motors driving them also comes thru the speakers which makes the music sound droney. Tried changing batteries to the highest quality we can find, but still has droning sound. Overall pretty disappointing"
3,it is cute but...,"The doll is really cute! Very realistic and not scary, which surprised me. But my 5 year-old didnt think much of it. Maybe because its favorite words are ""i'm sleepy"", asking to go to bed, which is really annoying. It says that more than everything else, maybe that's why it spends most the time in the closet... ""sleeping"". For that kind of money, it's very disapointing."
3,Not quite all there,"Our daughter fell in love with this doll, the moment she got it for her birthday, so there was no possibility of returning it when things went wrong (basically upon delivery). She now carries it around lovingly, if a little brutally (thank goodness the doll has strong hair!), unaware that it is actually SUPPOSED to be an interactive doll!For the first 5 minutes of our ownership, the doll *sort of* responded to the verbal cues, per the directions, but this minimal responsiveness swiftly deteriorated to stony silence and, no matter what we did, there was no waking her up. We changed the batteries, we read and reread the directions...we did everything short of exorcism and resurrection ceremonies. Nothing worked.By the time we actually got through to an Amazon customer support agent, and got them to agree to accept the return, our daughter would have none of it, and so we accepted that we had purchased an interactive doll, but owned a rather heavy and - to us - uncuddly basic doll."
3,A cute doll,We purchased this for our daughter's 5th birthday. She saw it and wanted it so badly. She loved it at first but now a week later she doesn't play with it at all. Which I guess is true for many childrens toys. The doll moves well and holds its bottle and teddy well. It does not recognize it's name however. It is expensive for a toy that my daughter did not particulary enjoy. I think mostly she is not at doll girl -so if your daughter is a doll lover this would be great. Decent quality.
4,Just Wonderful!,"I LOVE this doll! Thankfully, so does my daughter, but I do to! Its a parents dream interactive doll. It doesnt screech at you, it doesnt pee, it doesnt have to have special diapers or food. Great, right? The best part of it is this-if you dont play with her for a few minutes she goes to sleep and stays that way until you pick her up. Not only that, but she is a quiet doll, not loud and obnoxious like many talking dolls can be!This doll is A+++ for both kids AND parents!"
1,Dead Battery,"I ordered 4 of these batteries, 1 of the 4 had juice. The other 3 were dead. They were for a scale, the scale works fine with the 1, the other 3 were thrown in the garbage after much frustration."
1,Bait and switch,"this was the first bad experience with Amazon. I placed this order becauseI wanted Varta batteries, but did not receive them. Don't remember the wordequivalent when I placed the order. If you are going to ship a brand otherthan Varta use the brand name you will ship, don't mislead as you did inthis case..."
3,It was okay.,"This is a mediocre book on worship.The good is, it opened my eyes to the discontinuity between Calvin and the Puritans.The bad is, it is filled with a lot of useless information. A lot of historically irrelevant information. And a very vague section outlining what we should do in worship.I give the author credit however, with interesting me in worship more and also for interaction with Cornelius Van Til."
1,Eating bread when you have tortillas,"I can honestly say that I did not like this books. See, is one of those books which makes you think and I don't like to think. After all, why waste your time with Gore's dry,shallow, boring, treatment of the regulative principle, when you can read Max Lucado? I say, let us use our money in something worthy!!!"
1,Fraud-Deceptive- Lousy Copy of Originals,"Another example of cheap, deceptive advertising. These are not originals but poorly arranged and sung copies. Arrangements are changed, voices muffled. AVOID THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!1"
3,From the Publisher,"The first comprehensive study of commentaries to the Chuang-tzu in the T'ang dynasty, this book explores the fascinating interaction between Taoism and Buddhism through a reading of the Chuang-tzu. Focusing on the commentary by the Taoist master Ch'eng Hsüan-ying (fl. 631-652), Shiyi Yu argues that, in competition with Buddhism, traditional Chinese thinking took a sharp turn in the early T'ang away from the influence of Taoist-minded philosophers in the Wei-Chin period. Characterized by being concrete and unambiguous in approaching the issue of transcendence, Ch'eng Hsüan-ying's innovative reading of the Chuang-tzu led to a new emphasis on experience and knowledge. In both these respects, his reading has not only transformed the Chuang-tzu as constructed by previous readers, but also convincingly defended medieval Taoism as a set of practical beliefs that also were grounded in the metaphysics of the time.(Peter Lang Publishing Group)"
5,Worked for me,"Fit my Dodge Ram 2500 HD well, easily installed and in combination with the other new link-ends, really helped my stering wander."
3,OK but not as good as expected,"This filter seems to not wick the water throughout its surface as well as the other models I have used. The top part gets dry after a while, even when there is water still in the bottom compartment of the humidifier."
2,They burn up quickly,I have not had any luck with any portable humidifiers or the filters. They all get used up very quickly. These last maybe a week and a half of constant use and that's it.
5,Melissa and Doug Mini Puzzle,I have always liked the quality of Melissa & Doug toys. The puzzles are very well made and colorful. All of my Grandchildren have used them for years and passed them on. This year I noticed they were made in China which upset me because I thought they were made in the USA. I hope Melissa and Doug are making sure they are safe.
5,Great educational toy!,"Like everybody else I bought this toy to take it in a 3 hour air trip. I try to keep my 17 month old daughter busy in the plane so I don't get ""the looks"" from the passengers that would like to enjoy a nap. It worked fine for my daughter. She played with it, she still does after the trip is over. It is educational for her and kept her busy for about 45 min to an hour in the plane, although her favorite cartoon DVD did the trick for the rest. For a short time this toy is good to keep your child busy."
4,"great small puzzle, good design, not waterproof","love this little puzzle's design. it is 1/4 regular puzzle size, 4 in a little well designed wooden box with a rubberband to keep them in. Great for bringing in the suitcase, NOT for using in the airplane or car. I washed a piece and all the paper came off so I question the durability."
4,Mini Puzzle Pack,"I ordered the mini puzzle pack for my 2 year old nephew and expected them to be a little bit bigger, but to my surprise they are perfect!! love the little case they come in and the color coated tabs on the sides of each puzzle. A good ""on the go"" toy."
5,wonderful travel toy,my 19 month old loves puzzles and these were wonderful for the diaper bag. The only thing that would have made them better is if they had a small peg in the pieces so that it would be easier to pick them up and put them back.
2,Not so happy,"I was really excited to get this toy for my son. I should have paid more attention to the size of this item. It's a lot smaller than what was expected, it may be the size of a quarter sheet of computer paper. Wish this was larger and easier to hold."
5,good quality!,I was suprised when I got these puzzles they come in a nice little wooden case. Very cute and perfect for the car.
4,Nice travel puzzle,The puzzle is very compact for travel and the pieces all stay together while in the case. It was great for the airplane.
3,A must-have only for die-hard Nylons fans,"Being a fan of a capella music, and the Nylons in particular, I have to admit I was disappointed with ""Rockapella"". Although there are no flaws in their performance, I found for once that the Nylons did little to enhance the songs from their original versions. The songs covered are mostly from the sixties, and there is a good balance between upbeat and mellow music. The real fan will consider this a good album, as ""Rockapella"" makes for a pleasant listening experience."
5,Wonderful a capella from this Canadian band!,"Love the album, especially the song ""Wildfire"". If you like a capella and don't mind a bit of a pop sound to it, definitely give this album a try, it is a good listen."
3,HER FIST DVD IS BETTER.....,"ANA POPOVIC IS A VERY GOOD BLUES GUITARIST AND SINGS PRETTY WELL TOO. THAT SAID, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS DVD. HER FIRST DVD WAS FILMED IN A CLUB SETTING AND WAS VERY WELL DONE. THIS SHOW WAS FILMED OUTDOORS IN A SETTING FILLED WITH FLYING MOTHS THAT MADE THE SHOW HARD TO WATCH AT TIMES. MOST OF THE MATERIAL SOUNDED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME, EVEN WHEN SHE ADDED HORNS AT TIMES. I DON'T THINK ADDING A HORN SECTION ADDS TO HER MUSIC. SHE PLAYS ALOT OF FESTIVALS IN EUROPE AND MAYBE SHE THINKS BY ADDING A HORN SECTION THAT IT WILL MAKE HER SOUND FILL THE BIG VENUES.HOPEFULLY SHE WILL GET BACK TO HER GOOD BASIC SOUND IN THE FUTURE.IN MY OPINION, HER FIRST DVD WAS MUCH BETTER....."
1,Not as advertised! Didn't work with my DVD Player!!!,"The advertising on the packaging says it works with all brands! NOT! It didn't work with my DVD player. When I contacted the company for the correct code to make it work, they said it didn't have a code for my unit! So this piece of junk was worthless. Not as advertised - don't buy One For All products!"
1,remote,"this is a nice looking unit ,but there is not enough sale's information on what it will work on leading to a purchase that will not work on the tv you have .i got suckered in after calling the company they say there is another one i can try ,but i am reluctant after the first experience .it cost's more to send it back and ship a different one than the first one cost ."
1,No responses,I expected this to work on a DVD/VCR combo unit and it did not. I sent e-mails to the seller and got no response. I even called the manufacturer to no use.
3,hot then not,the moves are new and hot for my wife and I. but we were hoping for more visuals and better camera angles for the different positions. and it would have been helpful to see the couples getting into the position instead of just viewing them already enjoying them. We tried the majority of them and they are fun and exciting. hope you will find them as well.
1,Disappointed,I was expecting to learn the art of the whole process but the video only show the intercourse position. There's no lesson on foreplay eg: how to rub or touch your partner or where to touch first and etc.
4,Great Christmas Present,I received this DVD as a gift for Christmas and I must say that it is a perfect gift for any couple who is looking to add something new to their sex life. There are some great positions to try though some of them are a little harder to do than others. I am eagerly waiting to see what you have in store for us in Erotic Sex Positions. Kudos!!!
1,Severely Disappointed,What a let down. I learned more from watching regular adult videos than I did with this.
1,Creative positions but no real sex,Nice looking couples but not exactly what i was looking for. Not the most erotic dvd. No oral sex or close ups. Just a bunch of grinding couples which you can almost see on any pg13 movie. Disappointed.
3,Good but Not a Supernatural or Vampire Flick!,"This movie is o.k. as a college age slash-em up mystery thriller but I was looking for a vampire movie. It's pretty good for what it is but not for me. The plot is simple and well done: a bunch of friends get killed off, one by one and the survivors contemplate various suspects and must find the killer. Nice relationship touches and some humor and strangeness, ie, a guy dressed up as a maid while having sex. Not explained but interesting: quirky character. If you like indie movies in slasher quirky mode, you'll like this. Not SUPERNATURAL, but spooky. Some gore for you gorehounds but not over the top for nongorehounds..."
5,A CD as grand as the Grand Canyon........,"When I first heard this I was on vacation. I had just seen the Grand Canyon. ( The Grand Canyon is very beautiful) When I was in the gift shop, I heard the most beautiful music. I found out it was a CD titled "" The Music of the Grand Canyon"" My Dad bought me the CD as A gift. Now whenever I hear this CD I remember on of the most beautiful sites on Earth. This is a true Story. Get this CD whenever you can!"
2,Music of the Grand Canyon:,I ordered this cd because I heard a preview on Pandora. While the preview was very good the rest of the album left a lot to be desired. There was a lot of voice representation more than the music that I did not count on.
4,more than kind of like it,"i bought this album after it was recommended to me by a record store owner. i had never heard of them before. the cd is excellent, kind of a Cursive meets Harvey Danger type sound. the only fault is that it gets a little slow towards the last few tracks. i recommend it to anyone and everyone."
4,an eclectic mix,"This is probably MH's most musically diverse album, with an emphasis on ensemble music. Although this genre doesn't shine on every single track, the bulk of the music contained here is excellent and worth buying. If anything, this album could justifiably be bought simply to hear ""Rootwitch,"" perhaps the most astounding guitar piece Hedges ever composed. ""Ritual Dance"" is also very exciting, with its very intense and fast rhythms. The ""Point A/Point B"" series is an interesting presence, performed on an experimental guitar called a Trans-Trem. As far as the ensemble music goes, ""The First Cutting"" is the most appealing. Finally, Hedges sole vocal performance on ""i carry your heart"" demonstrates that the artist is also a gifted tenor. Definitely worth your time."
5,His music is truly a blessing,"Michael Hedges (God rest his soul) had been blessed to play like Angels were guiding his fingers.I got to see him perform his music from Taproot live at my college back in the 90's and I am SO GLAD I went! It's tough to believe that all the sounds are JUST HIM ALONE playing a 12-string guitar. No accompaniment when I saw him perform live. Just him alone on stage. Magnificent!His music is featured in the movie ""August Rush"", and that is what prompted me to pull Taproot out of my music drawer and listen once again. Wonderful to listen to with all of his nuances. My favorite is 'Ritual Dance', and my second favorite is 'Rootwitch'. I can feel his passion and energy in every cell of my body.I was so sad to find out he passed away in a car accident. It makes the CD's I have of his so precious.Turn up your volume, and enjoy!"
4,Fully Satisfying,"From the first note to the last, I couldn't stop listening to this recording. I was stunned at the beauty and character of Hedge's voice (since we hadn't heard him sing before this). The final track (I Carry Your Heart) is still the most perfect song of love and devotion I have ever experienced, and I mean just that, experienced; this song left me more satisfied as a listener than I have ever been. Michael Hedges will be missed."
4,Beautiful Celtic music,"If you are looking for simple lyrics and a gentle Celtic sound, you've come to the right CD. The Tryst has a slow and uplifting but slightly melancholy sound, while the piano on Through The Castle Garden builds into the song beautifully. Snow Is Lightly Falling features the singer's lovely voice and longing lyrics that suit the title.Somehow, even the light-hearted A Jig Of Sorts manages to blend nicely with the rest of the CD. My favorite I think must be The Abbot, it is very Celtic sounding and lifts one all at once away. Occasionally I feel the music is jilting, but I believe that repeated listenings will smooth that away. Otherwise, I have no complaints, for some soft music with Ireland in the heart, this is a good album."
1,Major Disappointment,"It's great that someone finally came out with the 45 rpm recordings of this talented group, BUT: The CD incorporates an interview with lead vocalist Trudy Williams , and, amazingly, they continue the interview talk over the start and the finish of the recordings, which in my estimation totally ruins them! Wait for the forthcoming ACE records release - they've got too much class to foul up the recordings this way!"
5,No Bugs Here,"My 2 year old is obsessed with this book. She loved it the first time we read it togther. It provides edless enjoyment to her to move the ladybug back and forth through the pages of the book. We use it as a bed time book, sending ladybug to bed under her leaf at the end of the book. Surprisingly the ladybug has held up well with all the use - the book even provides a template for a new bug should the original bug disappear. I highly recommend this book."
4,scorching!,"Tony Romero is a certified class I bad guy. You wouldn't want to make him mad and you wouldn't want your daughter to be within ten feet of him. In fact, he's an almost completely rotten kid but Richard Prather made the character so fascinating that I couldn't stop reading. Bit by bit you get to see that there is a glimmer of hope for Tony. He has one chance to get out of the life of pimping and organized crime but will he take it?The ending of the book is particularly outstanding. It was not what I was expecting and it left me saying ""Wow!""This is a superb Hard Case selection."
5,A Great Look at Frisco in the early '50's,"This novel never stops moving, and there can't be many readers out there who managed to put it down for long. Additionally, it is quite a picture of life in Baghdad by the Bay circa 1950. This is not the North Beach, beatniks, black beret 1950's. This is the rough and tough independent town when the SFPD met LA mobsters at the airport and told 'em to go home. Apparently the little place was wild and wide open back then. Old timers - or those who just wish they were there - will remember many of the restaurants, hotels, and other local sites found in this book.But don't buy this one just because it provides such a window on that long-lost time. This story stands on its own - it's a heck of a tale."
1,Will snap in half in the wind,"I bought a Valley Forge 1"" Cast Aluminum Multi-position Adjustable flag bracket. Two weeks later a rainstorm came along in the middle of the night, and the wind tore it right in half. I'm not talking about a tornado here, just a typical (though strong) wind/ rain storm.So on the 4th of July I bought a new one. On the 9th of July another storm (not even that bad, and only 10 minutes long) tore that one right in half.The weakness of this awful bracket is the thin layer of aluminum in between the adjustable bracket and the arm. When a flag gets wet it gets heavy, and when the wind blows it's going to put some pressure on the bracket. Cast aluminum is weak and snaps easily.I now have to shop for a whole new bracket, and I have screw holes through the new vinyl siding of my house due to removing the old one. DO NOT get cast aluminum flag brackets for use outdoors, and avoid adjustable. Look for STAINLESS STEEL brackets with at least four screw holes."
1,Weak Bracket,"I have owned two of the brackets as well. Both of them broke in the same spot at the base. One was just in the wind the other in a moderate rain storm, but neither of the storms should have been enough to break the bracket. The only reason I gave it a second chance was I didn't want to have to redrill holes in the brick wall it was mounted to, but looks like I will have to unless I can find the same bolt pattern on a stronger bracket. If you live in a mild climate with no wind or rain this bracket will work, for the rest of the world keep looking."
1,Do Not Buy,"This cast aluminum bracket broke in half at the base, at the point where it adjusts to different angles. It is not well engineered. This failure is apparently the same as several others have had before me.I called Valley Forge Flag to see if they would replace the bracket and they would not. But the funniest part was that two different reps (including one supervisor) told me tha the flag & pole had to be removed from the base if ANY wind & rain was expected.I go out of my way to buy American made products but ...Do yourself a favor and buy elsewhere ... Made in America (PA in this case)does not automatically guarantee good quality.I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before buying this bracket."
2,"Yeah well, I was kind of dissapionted.","The music on the soundtrack is SOOO good. It is one of the best musicals I have ever heard really! But this music book is not so hot. It looks like someone just threw it together one day. The bass clef usaully just has one note on it for a whole measure! Some of the sections don't even sound like the real music. I was really sad because I like the music a lot. The songs are in the right key, but the accompanyment is not worth the money, unless you plan on adding in your own chords."
4,Love Paz!,"We love Paz, but the others characters don't interest my 2-year old little girl as much. I'd rather have a Paz-only version with more content. Good video, though. She does watch it often."
2,Overkill & Underfit,"All the ports seem to work OK, but when the 2006 Dell E310 Dimension case is reassembled, the way the usb ports are aligned perpendicular instead of parallel to the bracket prevents their use. For my needs maybe 2 USB and 1 FW port might have been enough, if they were in the proper bracket oreintation, and I use a powered USB hub. I didn't return it however."
2,Don't Buy,"There are no instructions as mentioned before but my biggest complaint is that the card would not fit into the slot in the back of the computer. The usb ports and firewire ports were made wider than any standard pci card should be. In order to get it to work I had to squeeze the metal on the top and bottom of each port down until it would fit into the slot. Very frustrating and just wrong, looking at the other reviews though, maybe I just got a fluke card. The usb 2.0 ports work fine once installed and I haven't had a chance to try out the firewire ones."
1,Sent me the wrong cable!! Don't buy from this company!!,"I was not sent a firewire cable as was advertised. They sent me a useless USB cable. When I contacted the seller, they did not send me the proper cable. Don't buy from this terrible company!!"
4,Works very well,"I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about the almost no-name whitebox hardware. I was pleasantly surprised with how well these worked on several computers, both as USB2 and FireWire."
2,Problems with cord,"I installed the card and my computer recognized it just fine. However, the computer wouldn't recognize anything that I plugged in using the firewire cable. So I bought a new cable at Walmart, and sure enough, it worked like a charm.The whole reason I bought this was because the cable was included. That was a mistake."
1,Poor quality control,"Bought two. First one in computer would not start. Tried in two computers. Has whitish stuff on IC legs. Looks to be poorly soldered. Second one made computer studdddder and USB writes were slow to an SD card. Loading down the bus some way. Took it out, computer went back to normal. Saw that two of the legs on IC were touching. Had out white stuff on legs. I bought these two a month apart. Also had bought 2 other Sabrent products, one of those two was broke out of box, that 3 out of 4 = 75% bad out of box. Stay away from Sabrent. It is cheap but it is junk made in China. Both items had QC Passed stickers. What a joke. I have not so good eyes anymore and could see the bent legs and white stuff without a magnifier."
1,DO NOT BUY (REPEAT TO YOURSELF 10X),"Needed IEEE 1394a port for analytical instrument. The fact that it also came with three USB ports was nice bonus. When opened and examined, visible evidence of corrosion on chip leads with a white-ish haze on most of the solder joints (residual flux?). With pit in stomach, I installed in XP Pro system. On boot-up it looked promising until one USB port identified as malfunction. System then crashed, no mouse, no keyboard. Tried other free slot, system crashed at BIOS, blue screen. Also, the USB ports are blocked by the metal frame of the PC. You might be able to get a mem stick in but keep a pair of pliers handy to extract it. ""QC passed"" sticky on the card!That all said, If you need to purchase a FW IEEE 1394a make sure it doesn't say Sabrent on the box.No hassle return, still love Amazon."
1,Junk,"Was not factory sealed box said 8 port and card was 6 port (as ordered) device manager would not add card no matter what I did, used my cable and still would not work. i put my old cards back in as I had ordered this card to free up a PCI slot my 2 cards were in. I tried to find a driver but could not, I'm running Windows 7 OS. Card was inexpensive so not worth sending back will look for a NAME brand next time."
1,Dead on arrival,I installed the card into the computer and it the computer would no longer complete post. Reseated the card and tried another PCI card and computer continued to no longer post. I took the card out and examined it under magnfying glass and found multiple pins appeared to have a rust like material crossing them. Overall the assembly looks poor even though it has the QC sticker on it saying pass. I tried emailing and calling the manufacturer and was unable to ever talk to anyone. I let it sit in the box to long to get an amazon return. A complete waste of money.
2,Died in a few months,When I first received this product I installed it and it ran fine for about 2 months then it just died. I gave two stars because it did work for a time but two months really doesn't cut it. Spend a bit more and get something better (that is what I have to do now).
2,adapter card,I had trouble with installing the firewire port. I did not get any help with the company.
1,Does not work with Vista.,"Although it says ""Works with Vista"" it did not for me. Documentation was not helpful."
2,Sabrent usb& firewire pci card,Card seems to work fine on 2-3 of the USB ports but problem on a couple of the others. Maybe I need to set something under device manager but no indication in the installation instructions. They should mention that a couple of the ports 1 usb and 1 firewire are internal which seems useless to me.
1,Don't buy it !!!,"I installed the product, and the computer found the new hardware and has installed the drivers. Than I tried to use it. I used several programs to import some video (Adobe premiere CS3, Premiere Elements 4, 3, Ulead, DVgate, Pinnacle 11 Ultimate...). No luck ! The computer froze. I have a Sony with XP, 2 gb ram, Nvidia with 526 mb and 500 gb hardrive. It just dosen't work. It was cheap...but trash. So I bought another firewire PCI from CompUsa for 15$ which worked perfectly (it came with cable, to).Next time I will realy consider what other reviews are saying about a product, before buying it! So, again, my advise is don't buy it! But ultimately is your money..."
3,My Son Likes It,"It's a cute book about poo. My 2 year old enjoys it as he can pronounce the title. The illustrations are okay, not really my style. The story isn't as funny as a previous reviewer mentioned. I found the rhymes, or maybe the flow of the book to be a little weak."
1,Worst monitor ever!,"This monitor is the worst thing ever! I would give it zero stars if that were possible! Mine says that it is on, but I can hear nothing-all the while my little girl is upstairs above me screaming and scared! Do not buy this if you care about your kids at all!!!!"
3,Happy with it..especially for the price.,"We bought this monitor on sale and were thoroughly pleased. It has great range(so good in fact that I was able to run across the street to my neighbours to grab some milk while my daughter was sleeping). The blue light can be annoying but I just turn the monitor away from me when I sleep so that I can hear but not see it. As for the settings, the lowest one is perfect, you never hear any humming but when my daughter cries it picks it right away and quite loudly that any higher is not necessary unless you were in a loud room with a lot going on. All in all I say this monitor is great for what we need, and other friends of ours have bought more expensive ones which do not have nearly as good range as this one."
3,Great looks but makes a humming noise,"The product arrived quick as expected. I does look sharp, is easy to set up and offers great convenience with the rechargeable batteries and clip on dual receivers.I does make a humming noise, even when the room is totally quite. Some folks say that is normal and that all baby monitors do that. For the price I pay for it I am willing to put up with the humming noise."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is the most obnoxious monitor. RIght away it: does not hold a charge, makes the most obnoxious beeping sounds whether on it's base or off, cuts out for long periods of time, goes in and out of transmission. It's horrible. It gives me anxiety. It's a giant piece of crap. Save your money. I read the bad reviews on several websites and decided to go for it to save money which was a bad idea. You're not saving money if you have to later replace the piece of junk. I don't normally give bad reviews. I'm a glass is half full type of gal. Don't buy it. I will never buy anything by this company. I wouldn't even take something of theirs as a gift."
1,Hopefully it will stay unavailable,"Somehow, we found mostly good reviews for this monitor and purchased based on that. The battery life is poor on the handhelds, the noises it makes sound like an alien attack, and we're even in a rural area where the houses aren't on top of each other! Who doesn't have a cordless phone and wireless router operating on 2.4ghz these days? Product claims to select a secure and interference free channel, but ours sure didn't. Because of this product, I don't have the faith to try a different Summer Infant monitor, even though I see them being reviewed much more positively."
3,OK...,"These are ok. you get what you pay for! does the job, but flashes a blue light and that can be annoying. Works pretty good though...Battery life kinda stinks. Overall I would say it is fine."
2,same problems as everyone else,"beeping, buzzing, popping, losing signal, interference, you name the problem, we've had it. I would never recommend this monitor to anyone. The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of one is because at least it looks nice and it did work okay for the first several months. Now it is worthless."
1,"Don't do that, bad , even not secure","Noise noise noise and then sometimes disconnections, loud beeps, you think you are still connected (since you don't have the specific sound/signal meaning you are not connected) but you are not.Finally we realised that baby was cyring, but not over the monitor ....Really disapointed, you can't have a peaceful evening even if your child sleep well!Even worse, the receiver is really hot, I noticed one of the 2 batteries made the receiver to melt down inside .... not very secure I think.Please avoid..."
1,Noisy intercom,I purchased these units believing they would allow the monitoring of a very ill family member during the night. The constant popping and buzzing has rendered them close to useless as that alone keep everyone awake. The flashing constantly of the bright led's makes your room feel like a dance hall with flashing strobes
1,Do not buy!!! I would not recomend to anyone,"When I was looking for a monitor , this one looked and sounded good from reviews. But after receiving it, hooking it up and testing it, it went back in the box and back to Amazon.The only pros this monitor has is that it has rechargeable batteries in transmitter and a nice charging cradle.Now in saying that the con definite out weight the pros. The range on these are horrible. If you cannot hear the sound/voice comming out of the receiver there is no use having a monitor. The sound is clear if the transmitter is no more than 2 feet away for the person/baby and the receiver is no more than 20 feet away. If the transmitter is more than 2 feet away from the person/baby the sound output is gurgled/muffled.I repurchased another brand (Fisher Price) and will see how it goes but would not recommend this baby monitor to anyone."
1,I would not recommend this product,"I bought this product because I thought my other monitor didn't work very well. My old monitor was not digital, so I thought this would be a good upgrade. When this product was working as it should, i.e. not making this horrible beeping noise, it did work ok. However, the lowest volume setting you can't hear anything, then the second lowest volume you can hear the baby breathe and if the baby makes any kind of other noise, its so loud it would wake the dead. I'm not sure if it was our house, or if it was the monitor, but we could only get one of the receivers to work without beeping all the time. This beeping I'm referring to is the indicator that it is not getting signal, and we would hear this beeping at least 30 times during the night. Our bedroom is only approx 30 feet from our sons room, so range should not have been an issue. All I have to say is, be prepared to return this item if you do decide to try it out. Needless to say, I went back to my old monitor."
1,Terrible,Terrible. Do not buy this. I repeat do not buy this monitor. Its constant beeping for no reason make the monitor barely usable. The blinking light display prevent me from falling asleep I have began covering it with a thick sock to block out the blinding light - That is when it's not beeping constantly and usable. Battery life is short as well. I would not recommend this for anyone.
2,"Beep, Beep, Beep!!!","A digital baby monitor seemed like a good idea at the time, but I am ready to go back to my old analog monitor! This monitor makes a loud beeping noise every time we use the microwave, tv remote control, or anything cordless in the house. I'm sending it back this week!"
1,Range is about 20 feet,"Yep, it's advertised to have a range of 600 feet. Our youngest child's room and our bedroom are on opposite sides of the house, he's upstairs and we're downstairs, so _maybe_ we're 70 feet apart, at most. This thing was ENTIRELY useless at that range. To get a good clear signal, the receiver has to be about 20 feet from the transmitter, which is utterly worthless.We had our trusty Sony NTM-900 which worked great, but it was years old and finally died. Sony stopped making it, though one can still find it around here and there, I cannot find anywhere (including eBay) which has a two-receiver unit. This was rated in third by CR (tied with the Graco), and I have no idea how CR gave this such a high rating--it's COMPLETELY useless. The other review her was much too kind."
1,awful monitor,"The blue light is WAY too bright and ours flashes for unknown reasons. We have terrible static problems. There seems to be a constant hissing noise as well. I bought without any research. BIG MISTAKE. Had I read everyone's reviews I would have skipped it. We bought this for my 2 year old's room to replace the AngelCare Monitor that is soon to be moved into our new baby's room. (Love that AngelCare, BTW) Looks like we will have to keep looking."
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could.,This monitor sucks. The quietest setting is inaudible and the next one up is too loud to sleep through. I don't know why so many people buy this thing. Our bedroom isn't 25 feet away from my son's and the sound quality is so shoddy is ridiculous. The only positive thing about this monitor is that it looks cool and comes in different colors. I bought this at Marshalls for $20 thinking I was getting a steal. What I got was a piece of $20 crap.
1,Terribel product-does not work as advertised,"This product had a range of about 10 feet before starting to get interference and terrible buzzing, making it impossible to hear the baby over the noise. I returned it after 2 days!"
2,they must be seconds,tires will not run true to rims when mounted. Center point of tread does not run true but wobbles when mounted. Sidewall is uneven with bead of tire.
1,Yet another inaccurate size.,"The first tire went on great, the second tire wouldn't get anywhere near fitting the rim. Quality control sucks, look elsewhere."
1,Buyer Beware,"I was not happy with this software. From the start, it didn't work right. I got a terminal error everytime I tried to open a file and had to shut the program down. I followed the instructions for installing the patch the company had to fix the problem (not an uncommon problem apparently) but it didn't work. The second time I called the tech support their suggestion was to buy a new driver for my computer (Compaq) which is less than one year old! Buying new hardware for my new computer just to run this program was ridiculous, especially when there are so many other photo software programs out there which are probably just as good or better! My recommendation? Save yourself the hassle of trying to return it and choose something else."
1,These movies are a bit outdated,If youre looking for comedy or any T&A on this collection you wont find it. Stay away from it. However if you enjoy teen dramedys and silly goffy 70's retro flicks then this is probbaly for you.
1,Don't even consider looking at the cover ?!!,"No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!stay away from it,they should call it all dressed up in the 70's .it's even lesser than soft core ."
5,Hilary Stagg CD Beyon the Horizon,Wonderful harp music that can be enjoyed by all. Very relaxing. While the artist no longer lives his music lives on.
4,bravo for the three amigos,This dvd is a blast.Although raunchy and tasteless sometimes it still makes me chuckle.I cherish this dvd for the mere fact that Freddy Soto was taken too soon at 35 but rest assured he's entertaining GOD.He will always be remembered as the translator on SPANGLISH with Adam Sandler.If you want a laugh buy this disc and keep in mind Freddy Soto's passing.We truly are going to miss this talent at a very young age.GOD REST YOUR SOUL.
4,Very Funny,I like all three of these comedians so I really enjoyed this dvd. if you want a good laugh this would be a good one for you. Enjoy!only thing I wish was that it was longer.
1,Disappointing comedy,Wanted a few funny DVD's for a long car trip. It's not funny at all. Possibly a few little giggles but nothing much. Was VERY disappointed. What a waste of money.
1,Illmatech Slide Dimmer - ill dsigned,"Bought a new home with a dozen of these installed by the builder. High end switch however the cover on the push button portion has broke on 1/2 the switches in the house in 3 years. I have even had one that I replaced break for a second time.I cannot find a replacement cover for the push button switch, which would be a $.50 fix. Frustrating with a product that should last many, many years."
3,"Some units get got, have hum",I bought a house that has these in about 10 locations throughout the house. They are supposed rated to 600W.3 of the switches have problems:2 of them get hot (1 switch has 560W worth of halogen lights on the circuit; 1 is on a circuit with 310W of mixed halogen and flourescents)1 of them has a hum (wired to a single outside energy saving flourescent light)
4,Columbus - Post 1492,"A little slow at some points about 45 minutes into the episode, but overall an interesting and in depth presentation about Christopher Columbus that gives the general public (and students if you're a teacher) a better idea of the fate of Christopher Columbus. It humanizes the legend that is Columbus into a fallible, arrogant, and devoutly religious man that ended up ship wrecked on the island of Jamaica hoping for a passing ship to rescue him and bring the ""Hero of 1492"" back to Spain."
3,why add Triona?,"When I first played the first Nightnoise album, I remember feeling that I had finally found the music I had been seeking; that which evoked images of the Irish countryside. The first 2 albums were perfect and would be rated 5 stars. Beautiful instrumentals which allowed me to visualize my own personal scenes. Then, the singer with the ultra-fast, annoying vibrato was added. The group was never the same and the CDs no longer perfect. It's so seldom I find recording artists that I want to play frequently and eagerly anticipate their next release. I feel angry that this joy has been denied me. Nightnoise, return to the original group and record at least one more CD."
4,"""Gourmet Cooking for Dummies""","I know a gentleman going through a nasty divorce and he has NEVER had to cook before. Since he is use to VERY gourmet meals and considers fast-food as unacceptable, THIS was the perfect cookbook. The recipes are simple, easy to find ingredients, and the finished product looks like the colorful photos and tastes like a 4-Star resturant. A real confidence builder."
5,Puzzles,"I love Springbok puzzles. They are quality, just like Ravensburger. It will take a little while to complete the puzzle since it is 1500 pieces, but I am enjoying doing it."
1,Another fake anime t. don't be fooled by a faker,Licensed screenprinted Cowboy Bebop ts are available for LESS than this guy wants you to pay for a bootleg iron on. Don't be fooled. The bootlegging of anime items is a real disservice to fans and is illegal and dispicable.
4,Still enjoyable,"As the Roma Subrosa novels advance foward, the mix between actual historical events and bogus Ancient characters becomes incrasingly unmanageable. In this novel, that beegins to show off often too much, as the plot is contrived (specially the ""mystery"") and the characters increasingly stilted. Nonethless, Saylor, as always, did his homework, and has much to say about Roman siegeworks and siege warfare, government in a subject Greek city and its relations towards Rome, that he manages to keep the novel actually intersting and compelling."
1,A mess in Massilia,"This is neither a good historical novel nor a good mystery. The set pieces are mildly interesting, but the author has to stretch the contrived plot far beyond believability to get his protagonists moving around between the set pieces and the historical characters. All the characters are unconvincing to the extreme; they talk in cliches and behave implausibly. Avoid! For a good historical mystery, try Iain Pears' An Instance of the Fingerpost."
5,Great mic - super sensitive,"We used this mic to pick up very low dB sounds in therapy rooms. This thing can pick up the slightest whisper from all the way across the room, it's that sensitive -- really amazing. And we have the mics hanging from the ceiling so they aren't anywhere near the source.Highly recommend"
3,Choir mic,Used the mics (3) for a small church play. They worked okay but had a lot of feedback and had to adjust almost all the bottomout to keep them from howling.
4,"Good product, just like the Holmes brand","I was very surprised to see the price on this filter, and was excited to try it out. I am glad I did because the filter works very well, just like the Holmes brand and much cheaper."
4,Playboy after Dark,"A time capsule look into Playboys' early years entertainment offerings. Some memorable guest entertainers including Count Basie, Joe Williams, Sarah Vaughn, Mort Sahl, and Cal Tjader, to name a few, performing in relaxed settings (both black and white and color). A must for jazz collectors."
4,Good jump into the Past - Playboy era,"Watched this Playboy after Dark at a friends house a few weeks ago, it is a hoot. Really interesting how Hef got his start with the magazine and then progressed into entertainment. When I was a little kid I remember watching this on the old black & white TV. Vary tame show, but excellent entertainment, rent it or buy it, you will enjoy. Nat King Cole is excellent, he is Natalie Cole's Dad. The King lives, and not Elvis!"
4,Question before I buy....,Can anyone who has seen this DVD let me know if they have included the episode with Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate?
1,Wasted Opportunity,"Amazon.ca has a tracklisting for this set, and the only rock bandon it are Canned Heat. What happened to Deep Purple, Steppenwolf,Grand Funk and The Grateful Dead?"
5,Inspiring,"Jam is a must see for any roller derby fan or roller derby skater. The story is inspiring, it shows what one is willing to do to keep their dream alive and to keep them feeling alive."
1,Horrible Roller Derby Movie,"I'm not sure why people are giving this movie good reviews, it was terrible. I would gladly pay someone to take this DVD off my hands. It nearly turned me off of roller derby. It's basically about a lot of washed up druggies and focuses more on men's roller derby than anything else. Even that makes it sound more interesting than it is. Trust me, it's bad. I want that hour and a half of my life back."
4,Amazingly accurate!,This is a very good book to buy. It primarily focuses on how our thoughts are vibrations and our vibrations attract certain situations and events in our lives based off of the numerological form of thinking.
5,Onion Dreams,"We think it is only a matter of time before Meghan will be known nationwide. She has a great following in the East. Come to Chicago, Meghan."
4,Excellent neglected verismo opera,"A fine live performance, excellently recorded, of an unjustly neglected opera. Lynne Strow Piccolo, in the title role, and Adriaan Van Limpt, as the tenor lead, sing their hearts out. The rest of the mostly Dutch cast, Netherlands Radio Symphonie and Radio Chorus led by Kees Bakels are all first class. Anyone in the least bit interested in fine romantic verismo opera should not hesitate to buy this recording. Perhaps I should have awarded five stars to this performance but MIGHT give that award to a newer recording with really well known singers in the main roles."
5,William Ackerman - Imaginary Roads,"Of my 1000+ CD's this would be in the top ten that I play on a regular basis. William Ackerman plays guitar but this is not just a guitar CD. He is joined by a variety of other musicians to make one of the most pleasing collections of music that I have. My favorite cuts in order are: If You Look, Floyd's Ghost, Down Treader, and Brother A Teacher. Imaginary Roads was the first Ackerman CD that I purchased in 1988 or 1989 and after adding five more of his CD's I have yet to find one equal to Imaginary Roads."
1,read before buying,"When used in conjuction with the telehook extension arm it can't hold my 50"" plasma plum. TV is too heavy for tilt angle bracket. I'd like to get my money back but its not worth the hassle of returning."
5,Boogieing to Aaberg,"Most of the time if you like the artist, the pianist, you're going to like their work. But I was expecting more laid-back material; and Mr. Aaberg and Vinnie Calaiuta(drummer) and other great accompaniment give us a show to remember. Having recorded all the tunes in a room with a basketball goal is nice but the jam laid down by these guys made me feel great, You can tell the group is loving it.There is some nice reference to using the bass keys. This one you must buy---if you can find it. All original material including 3 boogie tunes."
1,This is not for the beginner,"After reading some very positive reviews, I bought this CD.I am a truly beginner, and totally new to this language. But after I listened to the first part of this CD, I was lost.This CD is not for the beginner, it doesn't teach the basic conversation to start with, rather it jumps to a quite difficult conversation which has so many different grammars at once.I speak at least three languages and one dialect, so I know a little bit of how to learn a new language. This CD is not helping if you are a true beginner."
3,CD only has Dictatums,"CD is only a series of dictatums with translations provided. There is no grammar or exercises. Also, the CD plays with a video, the downside being that you can't load them into your car or iPod. There are no phrases or conversation, only dictatums! I find this approach of extremely limited utility."
3,Overly clever lyrics and derivative alt.country sound,"The dirgelike accoustics of this album unfortunately make listening to it more than a couple of times a very trying experience. It's not that the songs are bad, but that the lack of electric guitars and drums put the burden on the song's sophmoricly clever lyrics and, combined with the droning dirge quality it doesn't add up to anything memorable.Unfortunately the songs aren't good enough to carry without the missing musical assistance. The effect is that you listen to the album once or twice say ""that's nice"" and never put it on your CD player again.Reminiscent of a thousand alt.country bands."
4,solid mounting bracket,The bracket seems to be well made but I can't say anything about its longevity since it has been in use for only a couple of weeks. It looks like it should hold up very well.
3,Great bracket --- CHEAP screws,The bracket works great. But the screws provided are cheap aluminum. TWO of mine SNAPPED while being screwed-in.Be ready to use other hardware to get this thing attached.
4,"Good bracket, Cheap Screws","Good, strong, clean looking bracket. I ordered a second one after installing my first.The included screws are pretty cheap and strip out easily, so you may save yourself a little hassle by using your own, better screws.Would be 5 stars but for the screws."
2,"Sturdy, but poor finish and quality control","No surprise here, these are made in China. The finish is poor with areas of powder coat missing and rough casts marks still on the item. See my photos for more info."
2,Wrong size,Did not allow my flag pole to fit.The pole is larger diameter than this bracket.How do I return?
2,Not pleased,I was not as displeased w/ the product as I was w/ the company. I tried numerous times via email and phone with Amazon and Amercan Clock to cancel the order shortly after ordering. They charged me more for the shipping ($30) than the item. It was a very light weight item. It was not constucted of a tough plastic and broke the 1st day. The sound is very poor and more horns than drums
1,a surgeon thinking with his knife,"I read this book loooking for tips on how to use a bed alarm. I found very little information about that. The book, written by a urologist, is very focused on the diseases and abnormalities that can cause bedwetting. It includes many distressing stories of patients who were plagued by by urinary problems, infections, and erectile dysfunction as adults because the cause of their childhood bedwetting had not been treated. It goes so far as to say that if your child's bedwetting stops by itself or with the use of a bed alarm, you should still have a doctor investigate the cause of the bedwetting. It is my understanding that the vast majority of bedwetters have no underlying pathology, so the emphasis of this book seems unbalanced."
4,Great for Allergies & Itchy Eyes,"Nettle extract is great for allergies. I take it mixed with a little juice and it really helps with sneezing & burning eyes. I usually take it with eyebright at the same time. When I go a day without taking it, I notice my eyes itching and burning. Use a dropperful of each at a time in a shot glass with a little juice."
4,Well Worth the Time,"I was given this CD as a Christmas gift, and I've been delighted by it. Greene is a talented writer and performer - with impressive versatility. Check him out.What I don't like is how all the reviews on this page sound nearly identical - as if the same perons keeps writing reviews to prop this guy up, then signs a different name and town. Ridiculous. The kid will find his niche - he's that good. No need to contrive anything to get him started - please."
5,"Uplifting, Soul-Satisfying","I've owned this CD for over 15 years....and I listen to it all the time. It's pure magical, spiritually in tune with my heart, soul-dancing is the best way to describe it. This is part of a life-long collection for me, I will never be without it!"
3,As always great lyrical style,Those who listen to Terror Fabulous certainly would appreciate his mixture of rhythm and entertaining lyrical style. Big it up rudebwoy!
5,Fantastic!,I show these videos for science class all the time. I love the show and my students beg to watch them. Fantastic!!
5,Wonderful! My Son Loves It!,"Relating to the 1 star review. Yes the video quality is not incredibly amazing...then again, they were filming on location in jungles. Give the camera men a break! Still pretty good in my opinion, all things considered.Content-wise it is interesting and engaging. Lots of color, movement, and animals to keep children engaged and learning.Great stuff."
4,Great show,"I'm not sure about his fashion sense or the wisdom of wading through mangrove swamps in short pants, but my kids and I love the show."
5,This yoga is for everyone,"MT and Roberto teach a yoga sequence that is for EVERYONE....and they teach with gentleness, imparting peacefulness and relaxation. There is no over-striving or forcing for the ""perfect pose"", as each person has their own perfection. A great DVD for serious yoga practitioners that would like to have a ""standard"" routine to follow that affects every part of the body."
3,"Great voice, pretty good songs","I bought this record because I loved his version of ""Thirsty Boots"" on the tribute album, ""Bleecker Street"". His soulful voice is almost as compelling as Dick Gaughan's and that's saying something. I must say, however, that the songs here weren't quite up to the voice. Not that they're bad--far from it--but they just didn't grab me. Everybody else seems to love them, though, so what do I know?"
4,Not his best disc - but it includes his best song,"I'm a huge John Gorka fan. All of his discs are worth owning - ""Out of the Valley"" is my personal favorite. But this disc includes a song which blows me away every time I listen to it - ""I Saw A Stranger With Your Hair."" If you've ever loved someone and lost her (or him) - listen to this song. It captures the heartache like no other song I've heard."
2,Wonderful voice - strange lyrics,"I am always looking for new vocal and acoustical music. I listened to a few clips of Gorka via Amazon and was hooked. The guy's voice is angelic and haunting. However, after listening to the full tracks, the lyrics are kinda odd.For example:""I saw a stranger with your hairTried to make her give it backSo I could send it off to youMaybe Federal Express'Cause I know you'd miss it""Now, I understand what he's trying to say, metaphorically, but those lyrics don't really bring up a nice image in my mind.The rhythm of lyrics for other songs is a bit awkard, such as Armed with a Broken Heart.I still enjoy being mesmerized by his voice, but much of the lyrics take away from my full enjoyment of the songs. For a true Gorka fan, this probably won't matter. I will buy more Gorka, but probably will be very careful about which songs."
5,The best of Gorka,"This are songs of late adolescence, full of power and anger. Like an old Rimbaud, Gorka here delivers the main course. He never did it again in his later cd's. This is his best one. Better than anything he's done since, and probably better than anything he'll do.One of the best folk cd's ever!"
2,im dissapointed..,"ive read hundreds of commentaries in this vien and i can say i could only read an hour of this poor, dry, outline."
4,"great features, just takes getting used to","Meizu's M6 miniplayer really is an ipod killer for people who don't mind learning the user interface. It takes some getting used to, but the features can't be beat:FM, mp3, mp4 (xvid), and outstanding battery life. It really does get 20 hrs of audio playback. I haven't tried draining it on video yet, but it just keeps going.The M6 doesn't play any video just because it's XVID though; you have to make sure it meets the specs of what the player can handle, which is why it comes with video conversion software.The bundled video conversion software isn't straightforward so you might want to check out this website to get easier and free software (iRiverter) and the associated Meizu profile:[...]"
4,FM radio is useless,"My major complain is that the FM radio function is pathetic. As for customer support, when I downloaded a video converter from their offical website(WisMencoder), my computer reported trojan found."
3,The Impressionists,It is very fascinating to learn all about the Impressionists. I myself am an artist and that is the way I paint also. This DVD is a treasure.
3,Other uses for the feeder,The bigger birds had some problems landing and staying on this feeder to feed off the standard sized suet cake I put in it. Smaller birds were not interested. Maybe it would work if you had enough patience. The suet cake was in it for about a week and a half after which I decided to chuck it before it rotted. But the feeder works for putting halved unshelled peanuts for some small birds that steadily work on it. I had to modify the feeder. The holes are too big so I made them smaller by weaving thick transparent nylon threads through them. They are flexible so the birds are able to tease out the peanuts. Not great but at least it's not a total waste. It works for some specific birds that I want to feed undisturbed by the bigger more aggressive birds. The feeder is cheap stuff but easy to manipulate.
4,a nice little book...,"with short essays of varying degrees of perceptiveness. I thought Brinkley's best essays are the ones about relatively obscure politicians like Theodore Bilbo and Martin Dies. (He notes that Dies accused Franklin Roosevelt of PLANNING Pearl Harbor- far worse than anything even Michael Moore said about Bush - and Dies was a congressman of FDR's own party!) By contrast, he doesn't tell me anything I don't already know about Clinton."
3,This ain't your grandpa's spoof!,"Plain and simple, Taintlight is a spoof of the Twilight movies. It's horribly low budget, horribly acted, and just plain horrible. That being said, it is a low budget spoof, so if you're expecting awesome camera work, special effects, and great acting, you're going to be very sad. If you can get over the incest jokes and the low quality, then it's not too bad. Yes, it's a group of friends that got together and filmed a movie, but if you're sick of all the Twilight hype, you might just find some enjoyment in this flick. If not, why are you even buying a movie without having seen it first?!"
3,Mediocre,"The movie seems low budget and not a lot of time put into it, but it does have its redeeming factors. It's the type of movie that you watch and laugh about the scenes later rather then when it happens in the movie."
4,Absolutely funny,"Ok, so I'm in the middle of watching this, but it's hilarious! I know the incest Dad is a bit over the top, but despite the micro budget they really hit the nail on the head with all the Twilight crap. I think the production values and stupid dialogue more honestly reveal the crap that is Twilight than the big budget movie did."
1,"lly a review, just a note to the people who make this kind of film.","If you want your film to be a financial success, there are only two ways:1) Really good story, photography, effects and acting and lots of luck.2) Blood/gore, lots of fun or scary violence and lots of mostly attractive female full nudity.Trust me or not, those are your options."
1,Taintlight,"A pretty horrible movie I must say. I watched the whole thing and I don't know why. I had hopes that it would get better but nope, it was god awful, not funny at all. If you are going to see a parody of Twilight, just go see Vampires Suck. Vampires Suck is pure genius compared to this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, I BEG YOU!"
2,Ugh.,"While I realize this movie is a spoof, it's still not worth $18. If you really want to see it, get it on Netflix Instant.It has the quality of something high schoolers would make with daddy's camcorder. The writers are obsessed with poop jokes, feces was a running theme throughout the movie.The best part of the whole thing was their take on Jasper Cullen. It had me laughing hysterically."
1,not even stupid funny,"Some movies are so dumb that they are funny, But this is a movie that I would have made at age 12 maybe and thought was funny, it's not good at all."
2,Tainted My Time,"Poor quality, poor acting, and poor storyline. I realize this is a low budget film, but I've seen less sloppy work on sting budgets before. Raunchy humor, obscenities, disgusting sexual innuendos, camera shaking, poor wardrobe....pretty much everything that screams cheap. I'm sure the kiddos had fun making this, but not the best film to watch on a Friday night. You're better off watching Plan 9 from Outer Space. I think the only thing I liked about the film was some of the music, but it distracted me from the film altogether, which defeated the purpose of watching it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"We watched the first ten minutes of this before we shut it off. It's essentially the quality of something a bunch of high schoolers would make: badly written, horribly shot (on an old camcorder, it looks like), with cheesy costumes, props, and fake mustaches. How this ended up on Amazon, let alone priced at $18, is beyond me. This is something that should be up on Youtube, not for sale on Amazon.Avoid this like the plague."
1,omg it is so bad,"it's essentially a bunch of kids, either high school or college age trying their hardest to parody twilight. Parts of it that actually mock the ridiculousness of the series kind of succeed but everything they changed (different characters based on their lack of crew) is really awful and sophomoric at best (which, realistically you could say about twilight too)the epic fight scene at the end makes it kind of worth the hour you'll spend watching it. maybe. if you're really drunk"
1,Like a soft core porno without the sex or nudity.,"I swear this thing is just as bad as those porno movies that have no story to it and it's all about the sex and nudity. This movie doesn't even have the sex or nudity, but kept the bad acting, graphics, and story. However, there are a lot of sex jokes, bad jokes, and stupid jokes. There also plenty of sexual and masturbation jokes with the dad and daughter. Then again, there just a lot of sexual jokes with the daughter, period."
1,This Movie is about as Fun as Swallowing Thumbtacks,"I've seen some awful movies inexplicably wind up on DVD, and Taintlight is easily one of the worst. There are dozens of things wrong with this movie, but I can sum it up with:1. It's not remotely funny.2. It was shot entirely with a camcorder.3. There's no use of lighting or color correction.That was 65 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."
3,SHUT UP STELLA,"For those who desire to see a decent spoof of ""Twilight"" I would recommend ""Vampires Suck."" Taintlight, which I found funny at times, was mostly crude. The film starts out with a man dropping his pants in the woods and then dropping the f-bomb. The humor includes far too many period, fart, incest, and masturbation jokes. Meredith Host is the twenty something that played a high school student.I liked the dad, who wore a t-shirt which proclaims, ""I hate actors"" which was clearly making a statement about the original film. Edgar would tell Stella to ""shut the f@#$ up"" and then say, ""I'll see you tomorrow."" Yes, there is clearly a spoof of the original, but the abundance of crudeness detracted from the film.F-bomb, no nudity."
2,The potential of such a fun idea completely blown.,"Let's face it, parodies are not often funny! Regardless of the reviews, I just had to see this spoof. It wouldve been a much better one without the father figure in it. His character was too gross throughout to add any laughs to its plot at all, and completely ruins the opening scene. (Since when is incest funny?!) If the movie had opened with Edward and Stella meeting in school it wouldve been better. I did have a slightly better appreciation for the movie after hearing the Making Of extra, which explains their loathing for Twilight, as opposed to an attempt to make a top comedy, which clearly is it not. Think of this as a student film low-budget experiment, which may give you a few sarcastic laughs and Edward is amusing. But overall it wouldnt have been difficult to write a slightly better, less immature script."
1,WORSE MOVIE EVER!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE NOT HAVING READ THE REVIEWS....I WISH I HAD. this was the crappiest movie i have ever seen. and for $17!!!!! ridiculous amount of money. when they say low budget i thought...""ok it will probably be a blair witch project type deal...or a B film""... boy was i wrong. this movie is soooo bad, it looks like a bunch of kids decided to make a home video with their dad's camcorder. the jokes are not even funny...and i LOVE raunchy funny spoof films (scary movie, not another teen movie...ect) PLEASE don't waste a penny on this filmP.S. this movie is not a porno. lol. the name TAINTLGIHT has nothing to do with sex. lol"
3,A Partial Life of Roscoe Pound,This book covers about 2/3 of the life of this amazing man whose influence on the law was enormous. His background as a botonist and his academic career have not been duplicated. The author who published this book in 1995 leaves out many of the personal details of his life and unfortunately was written too soon to cover his years at the UCLA Law School and in China. Perhaps someone else will write a complete biography.
5,A must-read for anyone involved in the college search,"I'm in the process of choosing a college, and this book has been so helpful. Although it can't cover all the colleges in the country, and it doesn't have space for every detail, it's still an essential tool. Use Peterson's guide for the bare facts about admissions, requirements, etc., but get this book to learn about life at each college. It gives you the truth about the dorms, the food, the party scene - everything the colleges don't tell you in their brochures. Don't choose a college without consulting this book!"
5,Great for parents!,"I have bought this for all three of my babies, allowing them a glimpse into my life. I'm sure this is not going to be read for many years, but it allows for later memories to be recorded. A great guide for mom's to record their thoughts and memories."
5,The Loss Of the SS Titanic,A must for Titanic buffs who want a true insight into that tragic night.Beesley was one of the very few who did not get caught up in the media hype .
5,Really nice!!,I love this series of music. It's really great listening to it. It can really uplift your day and change your mood....
2,You better be a computer genius,"This software was included with my scanner Mustek1200. The scanner is excellent.The software PHOTO EXPRESS 2.0 is very complicated , and hard to use. I've been trying to understand how it works with no luck at all. The help section is useless. Some great effects, but if you don't use regularly, you won't remember all the steps or how you did it. Makes programing a VCR childs play so to speak...Trying to figure this software formula out will drive the average person nuts. Lots of Luck if you buy it."
2,this is mainly for a computer,"Can't use this item as an all purpose voltage regulator only came with the cable to hook up to a computer outlet. I'm overseas and isn't not worth returning. I will have to buy a special adapter to hook it up to my tv or electrical appliances, as this why I purchased the item."
1,Don't order if fulfilled from PC Universe,"I ordered three units of the APC LE1200I 230V International line conditioner & PC Universe filled the order with three units of the much less expensive LE1200 120V domestic version. Then they made it impossible for me to return the units & get the correct version that I ordered. Watch out for PC Universe! The item itself works well, we have been using them for years, but only order if fulfilled by Amazon or some other vendor. PC Universe is bad news."
1,Home on the what????,Once again we see how Pixar is grinding the life out of Disney. Take home on the range. Please take it away. The animation is hollow and flat. It almost looks like 50 years of technological advancement is not in effect here. Instead of the film looking retro it just looks sloppy. Also the plot is another lame and tired excuse. With out spoiling what little plot their is let us just say this is like Chicken run but done with cows instead of chickens.With so omany options to buy rent this for your kids if you have to but buy Nemo or Lilo and Stich instead.Safe travels:David
3,Weak but Entertaining,Definitely not the newest and greatest animated feature but it is endurable and at times entertaining. I'm not sure if it is great for kids but the kids do seem to enjoy this mildly entertaining DVD. I personally really enjoyed the sound track and the colorful characters that are developed fairly deeply. The subtle adult humor makes it more bearable for adults to endure.
2,Fun but not much more...,"As I went into the theater to see this film which Disney has released with almost no publicity, I had a feeling it would be less than an hour, but be somewhat inventive. It's a trim 75 minutes, but totally predictable and somewhat pointless. Roseanne irritates somewhat in the lead, but Judi Dench gives it her best as the prim elder cow. There's a good final chase, but as a whole it feels a bit old. Still, you may like this more if you're less than 10."
1,DISNEY'S WORST,"As a TRUE and LOYAL Disney fanatic I could not have been MORE disappointed with this movie. There were few laughs and no characters that touched my heart. Even my 10 year old son was not amused. there were no stand-out characters and the story was lame and poorly presented. This was a thrown together movie that will go down as Disney's WORST animated movie ever. Do NOT bother buying this movie. If you MUST see it, rent it and decide for yourself."
4,a good movie,"although the grandson liked this movie, i felt that the content could have been better arranged for the childrens point of view."
2,Disappointing,"My 9 year old son liked (not loved) this movie. I was very disappointed. I was hoping for something more along the lines of Toy Story, or Brother Bear. This was more like a Saturday morning cartoon program. It wasn't terrible... It just wasn't worth paying $6.00 a ticket for."
1,Disappointed,"I'm a Disney movie fan, and this movie really disappointed me, not good songs and simply a bad history. I don't know how the Disney Studios dare to invest time and money in such movies ... they can not say that they are surprised, a sure failure before making it; any one could have seen it.It is a pity that they consider this bad movie as the last animated one, I hope that they reconsider the issue, and make movies again with the quality of the Walt's classics as: ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""The Sleeping Beauty"" ... and even the new ones as: ""The Beauty and the Beast"", or ""The Lion King"" ... Those movies left good songs and story memories in the mind of at least 4 generations. Who does not know the ""HI HO"" of the 7 dwarfs or ""WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR"" ... Who did not cried when the mother of Bambi dies? or Who did not dreamed to fly with Peter Pan to Neverland? These things gave Disney the so-called ""DISNEY MAGIC"" and you don't find it in this kind of movies."
1,not what i thought,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WOULD BE GOOD AND FUNNY BUT I DID NOT LIKEIT.HAD ALOT OF SILLY HUMOR THEY TRIED TO MAKE YOU LAUGH I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS BAD, SHOWING BAD THINGS LIKE BURBING CRUNCHINGJUST WASINT RIGHT FOR 3-8YEARS OLD IM NOT SAYING DONT BUY ITTHATS WHAT I THINK"
1,Bad Disney,"You'd think a Disney movie should be safe to share with kids, but this movie has pretty much non-stop senseless violence. It was supposed to be funny, but it definitely was not. Just mean spirited. Shame on Disney for this movie."
4,Home on the Range,"Home on the RangeIt is a well done animated movie geared for children to enjoy, that is children of all ages. Of course it is rather predictable for adults to figure out how it is going to end. The only problem I had with the film is some of the actors whose voices were used, just do not have the right quality or thought put into their being used in a children's movie. Plus some of the references were little too far out for any character in the movie's theme to be used.Over all it is a very enjoyable movie, and should be enjoyed by the entire family"
3,Not enough to engage either kids or adults,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I wondered what in the world were the producers thinking! A movie about cows embarking on a mission to rescue a farm from foreclosure??? Then, I thought, maybe the same originality that yielded the really funny ""Emperor's New Groove"" would be found in this movie.I was wrong!There is little to recommend for parents and children alike. The characters are not that interesting and the plot seems better suited for a television special than a full-blown screen story.The songs are far from memorable and the animation, as others have said, is too simplistic for a major motion picture.I had high hopes for a film that features the vocal talents of Roseanne, Judi Dench, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and, at an inspired bit of casting, former Texas governor Ann Richards.But, this is one ""herd"" that needed to remain in the open prairie.So, why THREE STARS? 'Can't give Disney any less, no matter how bad it might be!"
5,Incredible support,"This people delivers the best service, they changed the movie without asking questios, if you want support they are 100% reliable..........."
4,Home on the Range,My children loved it. They love music and dance and this was perfect. They also love animals. My local library always has this DVD checked out.Sandy
1,Too much adult humor,"I originally went to see this because my daughter (3) wanted to see the ""cow"" movie. From the comercials, I thought it would be childish and silly. I never thought it would just be bad. It incorporates A LOT of adult sexual humor. It all went over my three year old's head, but I wouldn't want her to see it again and think stuff like that is ok. There is also a lot of political and social issues brought up. The cows are always fighting, and the horse is just annoying. The horse is trying to attain a dream to help a bounty hunter, but finds out in the last 5 minutes that he is working for the bad guy and hurts him instead. The main ""bad guy"" is a yodeler and yodels to hypnotise cattle and steal them. All in all, it was really offensive to me. However my daughter still wants to see the ""cow movie"" again."
4,Good Family Movie,"This is a good family movie. Not great, but good and watchable. We saw it at our school as a school movie and I think the kids really liked it (first and second graders the most). Kinda like a kiddie rebellion stage without being obnoxious."
1,Walt Disney is ROLLING over in his grave.,"WHAT was Disney thinking on this release?Great vocal and music talents lined up.....TERRIBLE screen play.....equals: BAD MOVIE.Nobody in my family liked it (from my 6 year old daughter to myself).Okay, here goes....This movie had no plot (Save the farm?!? THAT'S original!)..... The musical score was completely forgettable, bordering on insipid (this from the guy who gave us the music in ""Beauty and the Beast""?!?)...Cuba Gooding (who I greatly admire as an actor) was trying TOO hard to recreate Eddie Murphy's zany Mushu character from ""Mulan""....and Mr. Gooding fails something fierce....plus, as a matter of fact, I think there is a Bugs Bunny cartoon from the 50's that did this whole schtick MUCH better (and much shorter, too!)Just awful. Don't waste your time. I'd rather watch ""Beauty and the Beast"" again for the zillionth time than to watch this disaster."
3,Home on the Range,"This is NOT for kids. This NOT a kid movie. Funny, but why make a utter (pun) joke into this movie."
4,I enjoyed it.,"I enjoyed the movie. I love how Judi Dench's character was so much like her. I don't know how much work it was to make a cow purse her lips and squinch up her face in disapproval, but it was a hoot."
1,save your money,I hate be negative.....what a disappointment. A cute story with tons of potential. Roseanne is the main cow character. She farts continually throughout the movie....a complete disappointment.
4,IT'S A CARTOON PEOPLE!!!,"Sheesh! My 4 yr old LOVED this movie. I thought it was cute, sure it wasn't perfect Disney style, but you know what? It entertained my daughter and frankly that's all that matters to me."
2,Forgettable,"As a father of a three-year-old, I endure multiple viewings of the same film on a regular basis. Other than the homage to spaghetti westerns early in the movie, this is a forgettable film. Ultimately, I base my rating on my child's reaction to it. The movie barely held his attention, and after he watched it, he never wanted to see it again. What has happened to Disney? Their recent efforts pale in comparison to the films put out by their partner Pixar. This partnership is apparently dissolved after Cars. Disney might want to try harder to maintain its partnership with Pixar. Their ""imagineers"" are simply missing the boat."
5,arizona,"Recipes include gazpacho #1, #2, #3, #4, frijoles, refried beans, frijoles refritos con queso, tostadas, olive beef tacos, beef tacos, hot taco sauce, chicken topopo, empanadas, flan, mexican candy, sourdough pancakes, sourdough biscuits, sourdough bread sticks, red flannel stew, baked pinto beans, mexican casserole, pinto bean loaf, best pinto bean soup, pinto bean fudge and much more."
2,Doesn't flow. Story wasn't catchy. Not for us.,"Every time we attemt to read this to our daughter, it is a clumbsy-read that does not capture our child's attention. I was attracted to the cover and we haven't apprecated much more than that. So the 2 stars are for the illustrations."
5,Great book,"I ordered this for my son. He loves it, even though the story is about a little girl. :) It is nice to have a book with a white father and black mother that he can relate to. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
4,When your past catches up with you.,"Not my usual fare, although I enjoyed the build-up of tensions. Vanessa Davis Griggs has written a lively, gossipy, Gospel-coated read. Her energetic dialogues authentically reflect how people can't seem to finish a thought, while others can't hear what's being said.PROMISES BEYOND JORDAN is a good lesson on what happens when you don't walk your Walk, & talk your Talk. Or, in the culture of this story - you don't practice what is preached!I am not going anywhere near how it is resolved. Some juicy secrets surface in unlikely places, good men emerge with their besmirched escutcheons squeaky-clean again, & some acid-tongued women learn about forgiveness & courage."
5,We now have plants that are thriving!,"Before this book, the few plants we had were just barely surviving. Plants received as gifts invaribly died. It was horrible.Then we got this book. We have filled our house with a variety of planets and our plants are doing extremely well. We now give cuttings and detailed care instructions to other people who love plants. Evans' book is very easy to use, it is an extremely attractive book with a color photo of each plant, and we consult it all of the time both as a reference and as guide to which plants we would like to add to the house. It is a pleasure just leafing through this book!"
3,"Ok, here's the deal with this ""laser jet"" printer","I have had this printer HP 2550L for about 10 years now, when this model came out it cost $1200 wish was pricey for me, but I wanted use it for a home business, and I was able to get a floor model for $700 during the holiday season. I am still surprise to see them selling used versions and supplies online. As far a cost it is very affordable as far as performance it is very slow and a bit noisy but it gets the work done. You can even get the toner and imaging drum replacment at descent prices online still, note there are different quality of toners. You can't really go wrong with some HP products. I am in the process of buying a refurbrished printer because my old model has aged due to wear and tear, and I can still use my toner and imaging drums, the printers usually does not include tone cartridges so I save money that way. Feel free to drop me a line if you would like to more of my experiences."
4,Very Good Solo Guitar,"A good C.D. over all, but ""The Emperor's Choice"" By Chis Proctor, and ""The prelude from the Bridal suite"" by Eric Tingstad, are 1 st. Rate."
3,Received CD but it skips in some CD player,"We really enjoyed this CD (tape actually) many years ago and we were happy to see it out on CD. However, when purchased this time around and then played on our higher end CD Player (Denon), the last few tracks skip. When played on lower end units (Computer, boom box) it doesn't.Oh well- the music brought back many memories."
2,the hazards of credit card debt,The value of the book for me was how Mr Hubbell handled his debt load...he stole. He told himself he would pay it back but you know how that goes when you get caughtup in DC politics. His discription of prison life was the most interesting and enlightening part of the book. This autobibliographic public confession was a plea for forgiveness to all those back in Arkansas.
1,Which movie are we talking about here?,What could be more confusing than this listing. Is this DVD The Immigrant or is it Eric McDonald's documentary about Eric Campbell?
2,Didn't remove ink,"I had high hopes for this leather ink remover. My son written pen marks on my parents nice leather couches (not suede, just a high quality leather). This product simply didn't live up to what it claims. It did work in my car for some light pen marks though, so I gave it two stars for that."
2,Too stiff,"I have been in physical therapy a while and used therapy putty a lot. This light blue was much more stiff than the light blue Thera- putty brand. I bought it because of the good price but it was a waste since it is almost too stiff to even get it out of the tub, much less do my exercises with it."
3,Thera-Flex Putty,FYI: The green Theraflex putty is as hard as a rock. I would not recommend it for people with arthritic hands.
4,good product,This is an amazing product. It always amazes me how it goes back to a pancake shape on it's own in minutes and yet it provides great exercise and provides amazing resistance.
3,Choose carefully.,"I've been using yellow putty at Physical Therapy and it has become very easy. Wanting to move up a step I decided to order the ""Medium-Soft"", but that was a mistake. Not sure if there's a difference between manufacturers, but this one is very difficult to work with. It actually causes pain and discomfort, should have stayed with yellow. Also, this arrived in a plain, unmarked container, so I'm left to trust that it's exactly what I ordered, and is what is pictured. There's no brand name, no description, nothing on the tub. Besides not being sure it's what I ordered, it also makes me wonder how many hands touched it before it came to me. I'll end up giving this to someone, and maybe going to a physical store for my next purchase."
5,Just What the Doctor Ordered,"After having had carpal tunnel surgery on both hands this summer, I was only able to go to a limited number of physical therapy sessions due to lack of insurance coverage for this type of service. I asked my PT if it would be beneficial for me to continue on at home on my own and she said yes that the longer I was able to do the exercises, the better off I would be in the long run, so when I got home from one of my last sessions, I got on Amazon and looked around and found exactly what I was looking for!! Identical product to what was being used in my PT sessions."
3,Syrupy Enough,"This was okay for younger children, but my little nieces did not want to finish it. There's singing and the characters treat each other well, but there is no depth of the story line, not enough there to keep them interested.I guess at 5 and 6 they have outgrown this genre."
3,Disappointment...,"Really great vocal POTENTIAL came through on most of the songs for Thierry Amiel, but the choice in songs was not very good. They all sounded pretty much the same (unlike Gregory Lemarchal whose albums are fantastic and quite of a varied sort). Too bad."
3,Nice Historical Piece,The images of the original manuscript are wonderful.A nice historical piece from the Early Church when England was still Orthodox.
2,part of a 5-disc 10 movie box set,"this is one of the worst boxed sets that I have ever purchased, but I would rate this the 2nd best disc in the set.Black eagles blade--HORRIBLE transfer of a movie with imbedded subs that are not worth even trying to read. This is one of those independent productions that manages to put some really good sword fights on sceen, I just wish that I was able to see them.Snake strike back-this is why I bought this collection and although the picture quality was fine, I didn't know it was a Godfrey Ho movie. Well, I've mentioned that guys name so I guess I don't really need to say anything else, except the fact that this is one of his few watchable movies, and it's only cause eagle han has such a good screen presence.By the way the only good disc in this collection is the one that has fistful of talons and kung-fu zombie on it, thank god I got 1 watchable movie from this ""collection""."
4,"a lot of the usual, but has a couple of 12"" versions!!!","track listing mostly says it all, but you do indeed get a couple of remixes and 12"" versions here. Aside from the Shannon and Jackie Moore 12"" versions, the Liza Minnelli Losing My Mind remix is indeed the full 7 minute 12"" version, Wishing On a Star by the Cover Girls is the hip-hop style 12"" mix of their ballad, and the HQ2 club mix of Jade Anderson's ""Sugar High"" is also the 7 minute long version. For the price, that's not for amount of trax you get along with these 12"" versions.http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/communities/reviews/preview-your-review.gif"
1,taste nothing like authentic,"This is crap with very little or no amount of propolis in it. Considering the quality of the product, this is not worth buying"
1,Pooper Scooper,"Read the description: ""Red, enamel-like handle"". ""enamel-LIKE"". It's not enamel, as I found out to my cost when I left this scoop in the pan, and it melted all over my SMEG hob and ruined 1100 worth of fitted oven. Not good. I normally love KitchenAid products (apart from their baster) but give this one a big thumbs down."
1,horrible,battery was dead when received I would not recomend this seller to anyone I bought a battery at the drugstore and now my car remote works fine
1,Be Very Careful of the Model #,"I needed an Energizer 317 which is a very small watch battery. Entering a search on Amazon.com for the Energizer 317, this Model came up as an equivalent.The battery I received was an Energizer B-317 which is about the size of a quarter and even larger than my small watch! Also - check the shipping - you wouldn't believe what I paid because I didn't pay proper attention."
2,Just OK,"If you know a little about the Navy in general and Naval Aviation in particular, then it's ok but a little dull. There were some good parts but they were few and far between."
5,A Great Tear Jerker,"This book was very touching to me. At first it started out boring and a little confusing, but overall the book is great. If you are really sensitive, you will cry at the end."
4,The First Bollywood Movie I Ever Saw,"I first saw this film during India Week at my university. I could only understand about 40% of the dialogue because they couldn't find a remote control to turn on the subtitles. It didn't matter. My friends and I were moved by the film even through the language barrier. Is Kal Ho Naa Ho the best Bollywood film I've seen? Of course not. But it will always hold a place in my heart as my introduction to Bollywood.Kal Ho Naa Ho is a story of love, friendship, and family set in the backdrop of modern New York. The plot is not particularly original (it can be compared to the earlier Shah Rukh Khan film Kuch Kuch Kota Hai), but the story is moving with a healthy dose of comedy. The song and dance numbers are fun to watch. Overall, a movie worth re-watching."
3,SO SO,I am not a huge fan of NRI based movies. This movie is not too bad. I like Preity Zinta a lot and so I am giving this movie three stars and not the one that I feel it should get. The comedy with the neighboring girl who is blindfolded because she is going on blind date is very contrived and foolish. But hey Saif looks like a really nice chap and I could watch this movie again just for Preity Zinta. I would of course like to delete all scenes of Shah Rukh Khan.
3,"Great Movie, Scratched Disc","Kal Ho Naa Ho is a beautiful, heartwarming film with amazing music, but the disk I got was severely scratched."
2,YOU MUST BE KIDDING,"i cannot believe so many people liked this movie. i try to only see indian movies that have been recommended by others (lagaan, devdas, kabhi kushi kabhi ghum, kuch kuch hota hai) ... and i probably compare all indian movies to these greats. this movie was awful. okay, maybe it was a tad sentimental in some places, but overall ... not worth the hours spent watching. curl up with any of the above instead."
2,WHATEVER! To anyone that gave this movie more than 2 stars!,"I'll admit there was some good songs in this movie and some funny parts but by the end of this movie I was so upset. Let me put it this way, if you like movies like ""Fanaa"" where you feel depressed, sad, and can't stop crying, then ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" is the movie for you. But if you like to feel happy, bubbly and feel like everything in the world is right than this movie is not for you."
2,Trash Movie,"Wow! I was all excited to see this movie after the good reviews. and boy..was I disappointed.After seeing some good bollywood movies like Jodhha Akbar, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.... this was terrible.trash movie.Preity was nice to look at..so I give that 2 stars.Greatest love stories ever told on film:http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R2KA5HYKSJ862R/ref=cm_pdp_lm_title_1"
2,Typical Indian Movie,"It was a sort of an OK movie but I kept forwarding whenever the great SRK came on the screen. I kept forwarding. SRK has started to become a pain and couple it with Karan Johar's inept , unrealistic Indian storyline made for NRI population, things get real painful. Saif Ali khan's acting was as usual good and Priety Zinta was ok. Story line has been told a milion times. Music was good and that keeps the movie going."
1,This movie don't have gujarati Audio as seems in the description,"I am learning Gujarati, and the description of this movie says that have Gujarati Audio. But that is wrong. The only audio of this movie is Hindi. Until today, I didn't founded any movie with Gujarati Audio and Gujarati Subtitles. I don't know why?"
4,Too sad for me!!,"I do not like sad endings. I kept hoping something better was going to happen. Would have been a great movie if the ending was rewritten. If I knew it was so sad, I would not have ordered it."
5,FAB MOVIE!!!!,"this was an excellent movie for those of us who speak hindi and those who don't. excellent acting done by Shahrukh, Preeti, and Saif!!!! Funny and heartwarming. i reccomend this movie to all those who are interested in watching a new and interesting kind of hindi movie,along with those just looking for something different. FAB MOVIE!!!"
3,"SMOOTH Jazz, maybe ""Quiet Storm"" - not meant 2 B ""Classic Jazz""","First off, yes this is NOT Classic Jazz, it is a modern tangent off Jazz. I find most of the selections here nice for background tunes for a variety of situations. A few actually are really solid, quite good, and stand up against current (2011) easy listening music. My only complaint is that while the picture is Vol. 7, ALL the tracks listed here are from Vol. 6. Indeed, the above music is from the JJZ 1999 release NOT the 2000 #7 release. I suppose the other reviewer was too busy trashing an entire musical genre to notice that little fact."
1,Lame lame lame,"I do not know what I was thinking of when I bought this CD. Think Yanni crossed with a generic string quartet, but without enthusiasm. The energy normally found in Shania's music is simply absent. Come to think of it, another one-word summary of this disk is ""limp"". (Note: the recorded musicians play their instruments far better than I ever could.)"
1,Ick...,"I have to say, this is not a nice sounding cd. It seems the violins are harshly sharp when playing...yes, most people will able to tell. I only bought it b/c it was cheap and I was curious. The curiosity has been quenched but not fulfilled, so I've had to search for better music. The first cd I ever had was a shania twain cd, and I think this insults those."
3,Not THAT bad...,"O.K. This isn't the Royal Philharmonic. But, for a string quartet tribute, it isn't disappointing.I own numerous ""tribute"" compositions and this one certainly isn't in the lower 50% range."
3,Expected more from 7.1 sound.,I bought this disc to see how classical music would sound on my 7.1 system. Turns out it doesn't really sound any better than a good 5.1 recording.
1,Acoustic Reality BAD Experience,"WAGNER: The Best of Overtures & Preludes - Acoustic Reality Experience [7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Disc] [Blu-ray] I bought three of these discs (Wagner, Vivaldi, Mozart). They sound like they were recorded at half speed. A 74 minute disc runs over two and a half hours.Music is so drawn out it is unrecognizable. The first discs I received,the labels flaked off in my player.(Amazon exchsnge was excellent,could not be better). New discs are no better.I would tag these as garbage. Caveat emptor!"
5,A must-read for anyone interested in profiling.,"A must-read for anyone interested in the world of profiling. It covers a broad range of material including profiling in general, crime scene analysis and profiling of serial murder, arson, rape, pedophilia and victims. It has a good chapter on geographic analyses and predatory criminals.While not a research publication itself, almost all material presented is linked by citation to a publication in its References section. It has a fair-to-good index. In my reading, this book is referenced by more publications on profiling and on serial killers than any other book."
4,"Good, well-written, but lacks depth","The author's writing style keeps the book lively for a text book. The examples are interesting and well chosen. However, only the most common types of violent offenders are discussed and those discussions lack depth. Most topics are addressed only superficially. Therefore, I recommend this book as a nice overview but not for research or other purposes."
1,did we read the same book,"I am in serious disagreement with all other reviewers of this book. This is not serious research but a rehash of some well known facts and many fallacious stereotypes. It panders to naive voyeur types, and I find it appalling that this book serves as a text to teach students and a reference for law enforcement professionals. What legitimate, scholarly purpose is served, for example, by reprinting the entire autopsy report of poor, littleJonBenet Ramsey?"
1,Ugh,"I agree completely with Dr. Chorbajian. I purchased this book in preparation for a graduate level criminal profiling class and have been thoroughly disappointed with both the quality of the writing and the depth (or lack thereof) of discussion. The authors may be experts in their field, but you wouldn't know it from this book. Unless you're forced to buy this book for school, opt for something else."
1,dvd that doesnt work,"I received the dvd and it was a ""bad disc"" in all the dvd players I tried it in. Very disappointing to my 3 year old daughter and I will not order from this seller again."
1,A kids opinion,im seven and watch this movie with my sister. and i thought it was boaring. i was SO looking forward to it to and it was not what i thouight. not alot happens. id rather sleep than watch this movie. but the pony toys are very nice. i recomend those not the movie though. mlp was not destined to star in movies.
5,A very MLP Christmas!!!,My daughter loves this DVD so much that I had to buy her a second one after the first one became too scratched to view anymore. The pony's work together well in this DVD to make Christmas special.
5,Essential Reading,"An excellent text. Discusses such advanced analytical techniques as Monte Carlo analysis and discounted cash flow in highly readable terms while providing a gamut of valuable information about this growing field. Congratulations, Dr. Mun!"
5,Real Options Analysis Review,"""Dr. Mun has converted his tacit financial knowledge into a digestible user-friendly book. He effectively leads the reader on a solid path starting from Discounted Cash Flow, progressing through Monte Carlo analysis and evolving to Real Options to get even closer to the target of achieving confident corporate decisions. His ability to clearly explain the relationships of popular competing analysis methods will make this a must have reference book for today's decision makers.""Kenneth EnglishDirector of Research and Development Emerging Technology."
2,Too many typos and mistakes,"Though this book covers all relevant patterns, it also includes lots of typos and mistakes which makes it hard and annyoing to read: The full code examples at the end of the book are incomplete; source code of some examples is missing there, but instead others is printed twice. The UML diagrams are incomplete or even wrong. The code presented to each pattern does party not fit to the UML diagrams. So if this would be the first book about patterns I would suggest NOT to buy it!"
2,A LayoutManager is not a good example of Flyweight,"To say that a LayoutManager is a Flyweight is to say that anyComposite is a Flyweight to. (since it is a basic part whichmay contain other parts, according to this book).Actually a LayoutManager is a good example of the Strategy design pattern.The book lookes good. Sun Microsystems and all ...If you want a clear book on design patterns in Java I would not recommend this. Mark Grand's books are not perfect but stillmuch better.-)|(-"
2,Read Head First Design Pattern Instead,"After reading this book, I did not see the author tried any new way to explain how, when and why to use design patterns. I don't think the book is worth the moeny I spent buying it."
3,Bad as a reference,"I just came back from lunch at a rival bookstore and gave this book a browse. I was disappointed. It's a real cover-to-cover book, not one you can just grab to look up a pattern. For example, the introduction to the Flyweight pattern, the first one I looked at, begins, ""Many objects in the Personal Information Manager can be edited..."" I am left to think, what the heck is the ""Personal Information Manager""? The next one I read, Decorator, refers to information in the section on the Composite pattern. I imagine the rest are like this too. So unless you keep the specs of this Personal Information Manager in your head all the time, you're going to have problems picking up the context when you attempt to ""browse"" a pattern.The Mark Grand ""Patterns in Java"" books present each pattern in a self-contained context and is constantly useful for me."
2,Missed the mark,"The authors had the right idea, the book had good breeding (Sun MicroSystems) but somwhere in between failed to make it to press. The book has far too many typographic errors to allow the reader to maintain a fluid state of concentration.I doubt seriously this book was proofed prior to being sent to copy."
3,"Not his best, nor worst","This isn't Isham's best, nor worst CD. It has some nice passages, and the production is top rate. But I think he fails to capture the worldly feel of Tibet and that part of the planet that someone like David Parsons has so perfectly on several albums. Isham also borrows a direct melody from an old Group 87 song. None the less, the playing on this CD is outstanding, and any Isham fan shouldn't be too disappointed. Those just getting into his work I would steer elsewhere first."
3,If only...,I have enjoyed Mark Isham's music since he made the background music for PBS' Lilias Yoga and You. The music from Tibet is simply wonderful. I just wish a DVD of this beautiful and thought-provoking documentary was available.
1,How NOT to edit a book,"I agree with everyone else that the book has some value, but not worth more than $10. The Wiley site is unresponsive to the feed back and judging from the amount of time that has elapsed since it hit the shelf, the publisher dosen't care. There's no errata sheet to download. I'll certainly keep this publisher's name on a post it on the monitor to AVOID future purchases."
3,"Good promise, a few errors","Learning a language in a weekend is a mammoth task, especially for someone who is not very familiar with programming. I am currently working through the book and have found most of the code to be correct. A treatment of the Common Dialog control in the first project (ShowOpen) does not work according to plans. I do not recommend this book for beginning programers. I hope that there will be a check of the code in the future to make sure it works!"
4,Celtic Daily Prayer is a good and eclectic resource,"As an Episcopalian, I'm most familiar with our Book of Common Prayer. Celtic Daily Prayer has a different and more open tone to it--the authors/compilers draw from a wide array of sources, from popular songs to early church fathers. As someone whose daily prayer life sometimes follows a liturgical pattern, I appreciated doing the seven different evening Complines for about nine months. The BCP only has one. I liked exploring the sayings of the desert Fathers & Mothers and the Celtic saints. This book does grow out of the experience and practice of a particular locale--Northumbria in England--and their local pride in their heritage is very evident. The book sometimes seems oddly uneven in quality or focus, but this isn't necessarily bad: the ""smoothed out"" tone of more heavily edited prayer books can close off spiritual insights. I like this book very much."
3,Good resource--Horrible Binding,"I appreciate this resource and use many (but certainly not all) of the prayers and reflections. The binding, however, is horrible. The pages are not stitched together, but merely glued. Since normal use of this book requires a lot of page flipping, my copy is completely falling apart after only a few months of normal use. Unless I get it rebound, I'll stop using this soon just because it's such a pain to try to keep the pages in order."
5,Celtic Daily Prayer,Beautiful prayers that set a rhythm for each day .. And for a lifetime. This is the prayer book I have been seeking for twenty years. Thanks!
3,Seriously mis-listed!,"Errr...since when are the Mozart Clarinet Quintet or the Schubert Trout Quintet ""Booty Club Classics?"" I'm just curious as to how this ended up like this.Haven't heard this particular recording, so I can't actually comment on it. Just wanted to note the egregious listing error! And since they make you give a star rating...I'll go middle of the road with 3."
4,"Great story, very down to earth",This is a great story for adolescents. The characters are very believeable and interesting. It is a wonderful read for helping young adults grappling with understanding how to treat someone who is deaf. It is also a wonderful story in and of itself.
4,Good but not great -- May be better for older kids,"I was very excited to get this for my daughter, who loves art at school. To the adult eye, the think handles on the brushes seem just right, and the bristles seem so interesting. My one-year-old daughter, however, preferred to paint with sponges cut into various shapes. I figure she may grow into the brushes, but a visiting 3 year old also preferred the sponges. I think they just like to be close to the paint? In that vein, my daughter prefers the Tadoodles by Crayola and the finger painting in the tub set by Alex.On the plus side, these paints wash off pretty easily and mix together well. They are tempera paints, not water colors. While not labeled finger paints, I don't see why they couldn't be used as such.Not a purchase I regret but not the best either."
2,"Great songlist, poor quality","This collection is very poorly transferred to CD. On many tracks it sounds like the band/orchestra is in this room , but we can only hear Bobby singing from the room next door. His voice is so far back it spoils the experience. There are some not so commonly heard songs which add interest and variety to this album. My wish is that someone will remaster this CD and release it to the quality it deserves."
1,"Not von Kleist, the translation!","Heinrich von Kleist was a personal discovery for me last year - I think his stories, novellas, and plays (at least ""The Prince of Homburg"" and ""The Broken Jug"" - I haven't read the others) are amazing. ""The Earthquake in Chile"" has got to be one of the most awful stories written.These translations are very difficult to read, however. I bought this and ended up having to go to the library for alternate editions - I don't have those books with me right now, and I haven't bought another edition, so I can't recommend which translators to get. This is just a warning. ""The Broken Jug"" in particular is almost incomprehensible. I suspect the problem is that the translator has translated German idioms too literally, at the expense of naturalness, and even readability.So, von Kleist, great, great, great! But beware, buyers of this particular translation."
5,The Best of The Best...,"This release is the best I have found to relax and rejuvinate! As a video editor, I often use clips from this disc as background tracks for my underwater videos. The spirit of the islands and scuba diving is alive in Guitar Odyssey."
3,Decent technique,"I enjoyed the CD; he certainly brings some excellent technique forward on the PRS, as well as the classical. I must challenge some of the other reviews, however, in that this is no ""standard"" by which to gauge the work of other artists. The compositions are quite enjoyable at times, at other times they're not as rich nor memorable. Overall it's a good recording which shows moments of outstanding technique."
5,This Is A Must Have,You can really tell Govi puts his heart into his work. He produces very beautiful music. This is a great album with some very uplifting tracks. I am happy to have some Govi in my collection. I also own Andalusian Nights and can recommend that as well.
3,Decent,"These bars are edible enough, but they really don't hold a candle to the Liquid Sunshine or Fruity-Nut flavors. The ginger in this one is very strong."
5,John Schneider talks about Dukes' Reunion show,"Thanks to John Schneider, fans can have a look behind the scenes of the making of the Reunion shows made in 1996 - 97. John took his own home movies and interviews the cast from the iconic Dukes of Hazzard series from the late 70s and early 80s. Excellent for anyone who wants to keep up with their famous comedic actors from Hazzard County. A must for real Dukes' fans."
1,A terrible book,"After reading this book, I realize on thing. Willard Harley is a complete and utter misogynist. Anyone who would suggest that a wife have plastic surgery to keep her husband demonstrates an incredibly shallow and narcissistic view of what marriage is. The sad thing is that there are many women who struggle with self esteem. Willards books does everything possible to undermine a womens value except within the context of how she can ""server her man"" I would not even recomend this book to my worst enemy."
2,Steer clear of this one.,"I couldn't agree more with (Stacy) below in saying that this book portrays a distorted message of what a husband and wife should be. Read her review and rethink reading this book. Husbands: love your wives as Christ loved the church, and gave himself up for her. Much more could/should be said, but I think Stacy said it all.For any Christian husbands out there interested in reading a truly informative and edifying book on what a Christian Husband should look like, read Bob Lepine's The Christian Husband."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"Well, this book was a let down. It is a stereo typical book where all women are needy and all men sexed up and too blind to see anything..... The basis of this book seems to be affairs so if you don't need help getting past an affair, don't waste your time....."
2,His Needs Her Needs: Building an Affair-Proof Marriage,"My husband and I both are reading this book together. We also started reading it with some friends (two other couples) in a small group form. This book is great for any married couple, no matter how long you've been married, or if you are having marital problems are not. At our group we read a chapter once a week, then each couple does the questions at the end of the chapter and at the end of the book on their own. By reading this book together and discussing the questions together it has greatly enriched my marriage. I've never felt closer to my husband then I do now. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great read.,This book came in the described condition and was a great book. I recommend it for anyone who is married or who knows someone of the opposite sex. It is full of wisdom.
3,"Pretty good, too much focus upon fears fo affairs","The book starts out describing the anatomy of an affair. EssentiallyHarley feels if the basic needs of a man or a women are notmet by their spouse, an affair is fair game! Personally,it's good information, but the info must be used with wisdom.We must become utterly dependant on our creator. ThisI believe is our simple, yet profound solution. I believewhen we do this, the firing order of our marriages gets in-line and we naturally reap the benefits!"
1,This book misses the mark completely on a healthy marriage!,This book is full of sterotypes such as women should always remain beautiful for their husbands. Dr. Harley states that's why men marry women - not because they care or love you. It states that a woman should not gain 1 pound more or it is grounds for an affair. Dr. Harley agrees that this is normal for a man to want to leave his wife if she changes her looks from the day they married. This book is not about healthy relationships let alone marriages. The only real take about affairs is how easy it is for men to cheat so women should be forgiving and take them back. There is never any mention about unconditional love. Marriage is for better or worse - something Dr. Harley has seemed to have forgotten.
5,LOOKING FOR A WEDDING GIFT? THIS IS IT!,"A book that unravels the mystery of human sexuality from a Christian perspective. You'd think that the Church would be a place that human sexuality was taught (Remember God thought the whole thing up on His own!); but instead the Church has taken a ""Hands Off"" policy. I read this book after 12 years of marriage and wish that I would have had it before I was married at all. This is a sure winner as a gift to a couple whom you love. Oh sure...you may get snickers when you give it to them but I can bet you this: They are going to read it because as the advertisers have already learned, people are interested in sex"
3,could be better,"Our marriage counselor gave us this book after I found out about an affair. While the book has many good points, I found it to be heavy on putting blame on the spouse who doesn't meet needs. The reason people have affairs is that they are selfish and covenant breakers. There are other ways to address needs not being met. We are now working out our differences, but at first my husband used the book to justify his actions. It could be a great book, used with care."
1,SUCKS,"Sorry, this book reads like we are back in the 20's or something,, this did not help me in anyway at all."
5,Step by step guide to a better relationship,This book said so many things that I had thought I had communicated to my spouse. In reading this book it made so many things more clear. My spouse and I now have clearer understanding on where the other one is coming from. The way that things are phrased are clear and spelled out. If you want better understanding and a true appreciation of how to keep your marage alive than this book is for you.
4,An excellent book - should be required premarital reading,"I wish I had found this book before my spouse had an affair. But now that we have found it, it has really helped us with the recovery process. If this book was required reading for all newlyweds we might have a far lower divorce rate. Marriage is tough and this book helps the parties focus on the constant need for attention toward your spouse, not overbearing attention, just awareness and thoughtfulness throughout the chaos of daily life. This book can and should save many marriages."
1,Women Beware!,"Warning! The doctor gives you good basic information as far as women are more emotional and men are more physical. It was Mars and Venus all over again. Then in the second half he goes into this bit about women watching their weight. Like women don't already have enough problems with this issue! He even goes as far to recommend that a husband seperates from his wife because she won't agree to diet! He thinks if women don't make themselves attractive for their husbands, it opens the door for an affair. I think love should be more than skin deep! If you want to take advice from a selfish cave man, go ahead and read this book."
1,"Good advice, won't affair proof your marriage","While this book contains great information for making your relationship more fulfilling, it totally paints a picture of performance-based marriage. If your needs aren't met, then apparently you are in a perfect position to go look somewhere else. That's not love. Marriage is about commitment and unfathomable loyalty. When your needs are met, you can attain great joy in marriage, but there is NEVER a valid excuse for an affair. We are in our 7th month of recovery after an affair that rocked our world and this book seeks to give some kind of answer to ""how could this happen?"" that totally disregards the true meaning of commitment."
1,"Arrogant, Self-Serving, Unprofessional.....DANGEROUS!!!!!","Doc Harley cites no ACTUAL RESEARCH, but freely shares his opinions, often pretending they are facts.Doc Harley's opinions are openly hostile toward women. Women are treated as less than human accessories/sex slaves/housekeepers for their husbands.BEWARE!!!!!!Parts of this book could be considered a handbook for domestic abusers. I am a Christian woman, shocked and disgusted that this book gets any religious endorsement at all."
3,Husbands Beware,"Husbands: to not buy this book, read it, then present it to your wife to read. Mine read a short bit, got mad, yelled at me and refused to finish it. A friend had the same thing happen to him. I threw mine away. If SHE buys it, reads it and then approaches YOU, it is a decent read and makes some sense. Is there a book out there that can help a marriage? Maybe, but it'd better be presented to you by your wife, not vice versa. If not, men, you are destined to be wrong."
4,Great Book!,"This is a must read for every couple, even if you have a ""perfect"" marriage! It's really very simple . . . treat others (especially your spouse) the way YOU want to be treated."
5,This Book Saved My Marriage,"This book provides excellent, down-to-earth, easy to follow advice for couples. The questionaires and surveys at the back helped me and my husband determine within minutes where our problems lie and we began to move in the direction of fixing those problems. This came at a time when we were about to separate. After years of no intimacy in our marriage, we were able to restore intimacy within the first day. After 12 years of marriage, I know that the next 12 years will be even better. I will give this book to every engaged couple that I know."
4,Not Quite the Usual,"I think Harley's ideas make a lot of sense, and they aren't just the usual ones about better communication. He has tried to codify what makes people love each other, and to help married people learn to fill the needs each has, but that aren't always clear to the other.Could be helpful for any couple -- married or not, opposite or same sex."
2,disappointed,"The author did a very good job of pointing out some of the needs of males and females and how they differ. He also pointed out the need to fulfill these things in eachother's lives in a marriage situation. However, the way he presented the situations was very poor. He took a senario where a need of one of the parties was not being met and proceeded to explain that an affair developed. This is redicoulous. The message this sends is that: you have to be meeting eachother's needs perfectly and already know exactly what the others' needs are -- or whatchout an affair is brewing! That is simply not true. A marriage is sacred. It is a commitment and it is a lot of work. This should be the focus. Otherwise, the reader is left feeling like they cannnot trust their partener if they unknowingly are not meeting the others' needs. It has potential to bring some insight to couples, but there are plenty of other books out there with the right focus that will build eachother up in the right ways."
4,The Needs,"This book isnt a landmark and it is not the best relationship book out there but it does hit upon a very important element in Christian relationships, understanding each other's needs. Most men can understand that women NEED to be romanced. Men don't have that need so they can't imagine anyone else having that need. They believe it is a nice perk, like a trip to London.An outstanding book I recentely read on understanding women's needs is ""The RoMANtic's Guide"". Surprisingly it is written by a guy but he seems to know a lot more about women than most women (perhaps he really is a woman and uses a male pen name)."
1,Is there a rating lower than 1-Star?,"This book caused my wife and I to analyze our needs and have deep meaningful discussions about what we need, but we disagreed with most of what Harley had to say. This book seems to be written for men whose knuckles still drag on the ground and women who desire to be subservient to their husbands. We found it laughable that almost ANY time a husband and wife are apart they are planting seeds for an affair. A wife gets a job and BAM, she has an affair, presumably because she really doesn't want to work and resents her husband for not being able to properly provide for her. A husband goes bowling and BAM, he has an affair because his wife isn't meeting his needs as his activity partner. This book hasn't been helpful, but on the other hand, it does give us something to talk about and laugh. If you're looking to improve your marriage, spend your money on something else."
1,"A sword of truth, right through the heart...","We were given the book by friends. My wife didn't seem interested, so I started reading it. I never made it past Chapter 1. Of the five basic needs identified as essential to the man's side of a loving relationship, I came face-to-face with the realization that my wife is not meeting FOUR of them, and she doesn't really care. This book, though helpful for some, glaringly identified the problems we are having, and my wife has no wish to pursue them. So here I sit, with Dr. Harley's ""needs"" which closely match my own, and Dr. Harley saying these needs must be met, yet mine aren't. Now, I'm certainly smarter, but I'm also a whole lot sadder.. Oh, by the way. The couple who gave us the book? Divorced."
2,Too Harsh for Wounded Spouse,"While this might have been easier information to process before the indiscretion as a way to understand each other's different ""wiring"", still reeling from the affects of my husband's adultry I am in no mood to be told I need to be a ""Stepford Wife"".We only read the first two chapters, skimmed the unreasonable topics to come and opted for a different book because we are trying to stay together.Even my husband felt that this author's ""100% this way or you won't make it"" attitude was more than he could understand.Understanding each other is important and what happened stems from the condition of our marriage at the time BUT my husband OWNS his immoral choices and is working on his flaws that allowed him to ever make an unhealthy choice for our marriage. I am sorry that he ever felt he couldn't come to me in the first place but we were never the cookie-cutter people in this book."
3,Appeals to the ideal?,"I find it interesting that some of the most admired, beautiful, wealthy and fun loving people around (""Hollywood types"") are some of the unhappiest with the least successful marriages. Just goes to show that certain seemingly important ""needs"", once they're meet, doesn't guarantee a happy relationship--or life. Better to work from the inside out; and focus on things like mutual trust and respect. I think this book does have some good general advice though. All relationships require open communication/honesty, mutual attraction, some common interests and physical/emotional affection. Just don't let your expectations become too high or unrealistic, expecting your mate to meet all your needs all the time (as all relationships go through cycles and seasons). Otherwise, it'll go the way of most Hollywood relationships - a sad ending."
4,My needs and his..,"It teaches about the needs of both sexes and how to communicate these needs to your spouse. It also talks about the dynamics of an affair and how to recognize and avoid the warning signals. I also recommendI Love You. Now What?: Falling in Love is a Mystery, Keeping It Isn't"
4,Great book,My husband and I had to read this book before we were to get married by our Pastor. I highly reccomend it to anyone who is about to get married or even just having slight marital problems. My husband and I could relate to a lot of the what the book said. We talked through it and pull it out if we need refreshers. We read it together and I think that helped the effectiveness of it. :)
5,His Needs Her Needs,"My daughter told me about this book and how helpful it was to her marriage. I have since read it and shared it with my two other children when they became engaged as well as some young married couples I know. It is a wonderful, helpful book and makes so much since. I think it is a valuable tool to help married couples better understand each other and work through their problems. Marriage is for keeps and this book helps you know how to work at it. It's a great resource."
5,Enlightening,"Has some really good insight into men and women differences. Still working through it, but so far it's offered some real value."
3,"Very Good, but...","This book gave lots of insight on how to avoid the dangers of an affair. It mainly focused on people who are already in the unon of marriage. I am a single woman who wanted to gain knowledge & insight on what to avoid once I get married. It was a little discouraging for a hopeful single woman reading about so many negative stories about people who cheat.I wasn't able to get through the entire book. It was too depressing. But may work wonders for those who are experiencing a cheating partner.I have also written a book - it's not about cheating, but a book for single men looking to find the right woman. Check out my site for more info: www.myspace.com/mynameizwho or visit www.nonierobinson.com for more details. This book is also available on amazon - simply type in my name to find it: Nonie Robinson.Good luck reading this book for anyone onthe brink of divorce because of cheating - this book will help you!!"
1,Not Biblical,"I read the original edition of this book when I was having some dissatisfaction with my marriage years ago. If you are looking for Biblical counseling for your marital problems, look elsewhere. After over four decades of marriage, I have determined that the number one ingredient for marital success is commitment. Commitment supersedes the importance of getting my needs met or meeting his needs. It supersedes the romantic feelings of love. A successful marriage means I will stay married NO MATTER WHAT. If you want your marriage to be based on God's design, you should start with the Bible. There are books out there based on God's design. This is not one of them."
1,Danger - Oppressive thinking ahead!!,"I thought this was a terrible book with sophmoric/simplistic advise. Harley seems to think that the complicated dynamics that obtain between adults can be reduced to sterotypic bromides that are oppressive to both men and women. On the other hand, it is a great example of how faith principles can be applied in distorted and twisted ways by shallow thinking fundamentalists.Stay away from this thing!"
5,Review for His Needs Her Needs,This was a great book! It is amazing how different Men and Women are. I know that we see it in every day life but to really see how they feel love and how we feel love is an eye opening experience.
5,Highly Recommend,Bought for someone else and she said that it was an excellent read and a marriage saver. I bought a copy for myself just to have on hand if anyone else needs a copy in the future.
5,Wonderful book!! (on tape),"This is a wonderful book!!! I highly recommend it to newly-weds or as a premarital counseling session.Also, the product was just as described and arrived in a timely fashion."
5,Marriage Must,"I believe if you want to get married or are already married you will benefit from this book. This may also help you understand yourself if you are single and plan to stay that way. It provides a road map that changes with the couple. He does not say every couple is a certain way, he gives 10 basic needs, helps you to figure out what yours are and how your spouse can fulfill those needs and vice verse. The book does that and so much more. The book is short and to the point. I don't know why the book has some negative reviews and some are very unfair and not representative of the book.Men and women will get what they want from their spouse if they follow the books guidance.This book can probably save any marriage provided both couples will read the book.If you feel lost or never want to feel lost in your marriage, this is the book for you to start with."
1,danger!!!! NOT A CHRISTIAN BOOK,"Demeaning and dehumanizing to womenABUSER'S HANDBOOK ....""How to make your wife believe God wants her to submit to abuse.""...might be a better title."
1,His Needs Her Needs,"He should be ashamed of himself....this book so upset a Bible college class it was used for that the Director had to repent for making the students read it..if putting ""look good, dress good, lose weight, read sex books"" garbage shackles on your women of God then by all means this book is for you....But if you are a TRULY Godly man you won't want your daughter or wife near this mess...couples book...please....man's book for certain."
1,Harley Hates Women,"Harley only cares about what men want.Men getting satisfied,men dominating the marriage.Women are nothing more thansex objects,submissive knitt witts.The book would make ourLord very sad.zero stars!"
1,Still have NOT received this book purchased through Amazon. Still waiting for the book to arrive!,Still have not received this book purchased through Amazon. Still waiting for this book to arrive!!!
3,Alternating chapters,"Harley is balanced in his approach to marriage advice: One chapter talks about what men need, the next about what women need. I don't see how people can say the book bashes women or men; it's very even-handed in placing ""blame"" for ailing marriages. He admits that not everyone is stereotypical and that is why he includes the questionnaires at the end: so you can find out for yourself what your partner needs from you and what you need from your partner. I'd be willing to be that most of the criticisms of this book are from single people or newly married people. Those of us in long-lasting marriages can see the wisdom in it. Still, no one book is going to be The Answer to a perfect relationship. Learn what you can from it and make your own decisions. I'm glad I read it, but also glad that Amazon gives me the chance to get perspective on what I just read by reading the opinions of others."
4,Useful recommendations,"This book was recommended to me by one of my professors. I would recommend it to anyone who has an open mind and heart about the growth of their relationship.This book goes over so potentially controversial topics. However, they are all practical and can help each spouse realize the other's needs. There are some worksheets in the back of the book, to coincide with the subject matter/lessons. The worksheet could be rather helpful. I worked on very similar ones in couple's counseling.Overall, this is a good, helpful book. It pointed out somethings, that in my relationship, I thought were not important to me--but really are important to me and allowed me to address those issues before they developed into something bigger."
1,More of the same societal stigmatism,"Dr. Harley is on the right track with his effort to help men and women put off themselves and serve their spouses. Unfortunately, it's the same rhetoric: that men need sex first and women need communication first. Sadly, society has been oppressing the women's sex drive since the beginning of time, telling us that sex is bad (not for nice girls). I read a quote from a 16th century woman that said that a woman's sex drive was 10 times that of a man. How strange that sounds in today's world -- yet I submit that it's true, and that all the propaganda is dead wrong. Ladies, you don't need another book to tell you what society thinks you should know. It's just not true. If you are married, then cut loose!The best advice I got for my new marriage didn't need a book, since it was just one sentance: ""Just put the other person first.""DO NOT use a book (this or any other) to stereotype your spouse. You'll only end up putting him/her in a box. Try really listening instead!"
2,Good for whom?,"Not withstanding the substantial benefit of insight gained through paying attention to your partner's perceived needs, Dr. Harley lists basic needs that are entirely too one-sided. Just one question: Why are all the men's responsibilities fun and the woman's duties chores? Ah, yes, the man NEEDS a nymphomaniac housekeeper to keep him from straying. I think I might choose playing games with the family over plastic surgery. Hmmm."
5,Absolutely amazing!,"I loved this book. It is amazing and Harley hit's it on the nose. I highly suggest this book to couples. I'm a psychology student and from what I've learned, Harley is right on. He gives you a unique perspective that is easy to understand."
5,What an insight!,"This book provides me a lot of information about relationship and marriage that i thought i knew about, i was wrong. My husband and i have unintentionally made each other very unhappy during the years of our marriage. We did not make an effort or understand the importance of meeting each other's emotional need. I'm so glad this is written out so clearly and simple. Something everyone can do if they agree and believe in it. This book brought our marriage closer again. I have never been happier in my life. Dr. Harley, thank you."
5,Finally a fabulous biography of this great violinist,"I am a professional violinist, to whom this book has proven to be more than an excellent account of Michael Rabin's troubled life.Because Mr. Rabin's life is extraordinarily well documented by way of his own daily letters to family and friends, the reader gets a truly personal view of his life - his practice routines, his recordings, travels, impressions about everything. The book also gives details on how the recording industry and classical music managers ""contributed"" to Michael's troubles, as well as how his mother ruined his well-being. Most importantly, the book gives the true account of how he died, as opposed to the widely-misinformed rumors about his death. The author was himself a violinist, and writes the book with love and admiration for an amazing life cut short.I enthusiastlically recommend this book to violinists, violin lovers, or anyone interested in an extraordinary life."
4,An important book,"Michael Rabin's life and death have been the subjects of much rumor and speculation. Here, the facts are sensitively revealed in a most readable manner. Finally we have an important book about a very important American violinist.My only qualm, and it's a big one, is how the author, with all of his exhaustive research, could continually mis-spell the name of that other tragic figure in American musical history, William Kapell. Was this a proof-reader's problem? I hope so. Otherwise, for me at least, this carelessness throws some doubt on the integrity of all of the other details in the text."
3,Read the Editor's review before buying this book,"This book does not claim to be a tutorial on administering SMS. It is not a study guide, it is a resource kit, ie. toolbox. A collection of utilities to expand the functionality of the SMS product with accompanying documentation of these tools. Do not buy this book with the expectations of passing any exams. Buy this book if you are already familiar with SMS and want to get the most out of it."
2,a poor example of an admin book,"This book leaves a lot to be desired with regards to the technical aspects of SMS administration. From M$ Press. Way to go, Bill."
2,Just waste of money on SMS 2.0 subject,This book doesn't cover well many SMS Admin aspects. Consider Sybex or IDG books on SMS 2.0 as an alternative to this one.
1,Ripoff Alert,"The Kindle edition of this is a ripoff. Apparently the dead tree edition contains lots of stories, as a ""Best of"" anthology should. That would be worth it. Kindle edition contains two -- counte 'em, two -- stories, badly formatted. Not worth anything."
3,"Good, but only two stories","The other reviews seem to be of some other book that contains many more stories. This one only includes two, so it's not quite the value it seems."
1,Mass Market Trivia,"THIS IS NOT DRUM AND BASS. It has no substance, or content. It must have taken the computer ate least 10 minutes to write all of the tracks. Do yourself a favour, don't buy it!"
5,Just love it,"Wasted so much money on battery operated trimmers that died on me within a year until my hair dresser said to just get a corded one and I did. It works like a charm. Long cord and powerful, I trim my facial hair in under a minute which used to take minutes before and bad results too. Make sure you realize how small this is so it could be too small for trimming your head, but for everything else, it is perfect and above all, the price is right."
3,Okay,Wahl used to be a good clipper. I have always clipped my dogs myself. For some reason the last couple of Wahl clippers didn't cut the hair. They are not sharp enough and my little dog's hair if very fine.
3,Not what I thought.,"Thought I was purchasing just a small set, not edgers. So cannot use for intention but found use for it any way and is working well."
3,"Good, but spend a little more for something better","I just received mine and used it to cut my hair. The size and weight are nice compared to full size clippers, and the price is very good for what you get. However, I would recommend these for light pet grooming maybe, not for cutting people hair. The noise is loud, but manageable. The long comb it comes with is cheap and difficult to use (flimsy and is permanently bent from shipping). The guards are very sharp, but some light sanding on the tips got rid of some edges left over from the molding process. All this is ok, but where my real complaint is with the motor. It struggles and slows down almost to the point of jamming. That really breaks your rhythm since you are always worried about it. If you go a bit too fast it pulls hair instead if cutting. Overall, I can't say I'm too upset since it was so cheap, but I'd rather Have spent twice what I did for something that isn't a headache."
5,very clear,"I put it on the screen and its hard to notice its there. The film is the perfect size, and doesn't hinder the touchscreen sensitivity. Like with any screen protector, you have to be careful when you put it on, but doing so will ensure it isn't noticeable. The film also came with these little finger condoms so you don't get finger prints or bubbles on the sticky side."
2,Where is the illustrations?,"First off this book has hardly any illustratons. It has no business claiming to be a complete illustrated guide to anything. The photographs seem to be taken all off the same shop, as if they are just an advertisement for Streamline Tattoo. While they are very nice tattoos there are a tun of other great artists within driving distance of that shop. The only person who would enjoy this book would be a somebody with no idea about tattoos or piercings. A person with no knowledge of the industry (as if they were living on mars) may find this useful. I'm returning my copy. I feel it is not, what it was represented to be. I was very disapointed."
2,A guide for the novice.,"This is a book for the person who is going to get their first tattoo or piercing. Those who have done much reading elsewhere, or have learned something from the street would be advised to search elsewhere. The artwork is especially second rate. If you want to write an explanitory ""text"" book then you need some good medical illustrators, if you want to show off some nice work then you need good, big, glossy photos. This book fails on both counts."
2,The Body Art Book,"This book is written like it's talking to a child, which i find very unappealing. It's good for a quick read, but hard to keep focused on it becuase it seems rather boring, to me anyway. It also had very juvenile information in it, like safety, which is really common sense. The pictures were lacking. I was especially disappointed with the pictures that went along with the text, because they didn't have captions. I didn't like this book very much and I plan on returning it."
3,Basic information,It is very complete and has a lot of information however I was disapointed because there is not much of interest if you are already knowledgeable in the subject. Addresses the reader in an infantile tone which I disliked and I found it rather repetitive .
5,This book helps a lot,"I think this is the best book to get if you are planning on getting tattoos and or piercing. I was unsure of what to expect when I got my first tattoo so I waited until I had a little bit more information. I picked up this book at the book store and read the book. It had everything you needed to know about what to expect when getting a tattoo or piercing. Also, it talked about symbolism, history, and even the aftercare of tattoos and piercings. I was convinced after reading this book to get my first tattoo, a virgo symbol. This became addicting as I now have 4 tattoos in all with plans to get more work done. Also, until I read this book, I have never even considered body piercing. I now have my second earlobe holes, cartilage, tongue, navel, and a clit hood piercing. I am very satisfied with the results. I highly recommend this book."
4,A definite help,"I read this before I got my first tattoo, and it was very informative. It didn't pretty-up anything, and was right to the point.I would definitely recommended it to anyone. I think the picture gallery could have been better though."
3,"Very Introductory, but not really bad","This book is acceptably written and edited, but it is extremely introductory. It says things like ""There is potential danger of damaging your internal organs or bones, so read up on the subject before actually starting this process."" It was certainly my assumption before buying this book that I was ""reading up"" about the topics covered, but as long as the reader is aware they are buying a shallow, introductory overview of the topics covered, they won't be too disappointed.There are a handful of good color photos in the edition I purchased (2004) and some decent illustrations, but I would not recommend this book as a primary book to someone who has more than a passing interest. It may be a good book for parents or concerned family members of people who have gotten into piercing or body modification? I don't really know, I didn't have the patience to read through the whole book as I felt like skimming and skipping over most of the sections."
3,A well written learning aid.,This book knows its subjects. These topics are stated clearly and in good detail. If you want to learn the terminology and get a clue as to why some folk modify their bodies then this book is for you.
3,Good Book For the Novice Tattoo Artist or Piercer,"This book is definately suited for the novice tattoo artist or piercer. Lots of good basic information on both if you are just getting started in either field. There is also a list of tattoo emporiums/salons/shops all over the world in the back of this book. The book is low on anythong that could be used as flash, and is definately more of a reference book."
1,"Terrible Software, Service - Big Hypocrites","This company is just awful. They claim to block pop up ads yet they generate a pop up ad every time to boot your computer. How to turn this off? They do not and will not tell you.What's more, they DO NOT respond to email service requests even though they send you a canned response that they will get back to you within two days.Finally, try to remove this piece of s**t. This is worse than a root kit.I will never buy software from this company again and neither should anyone else - either a consumer or business. How can you trust anyone like this?You think the executives and management at this company use their own software? They probably donate it to third world countries or Goodwill for hefty tax credits.Call them eHypocrite, not eTrust."
1,i would give it a zero if i have the choice,"Pro: NONECon:-the AntiVirus in this suite is worse than a 5 years old outdated AV. it can detect viruses but can't delete them when it fails to clean or quarantine them.-the firewall is outdated compare to ZoneAlarm (they use the same TrueVector engine, but different version).return it if you still have the chance."
3,Not the best Christie,"This is for competists who have listened to all the other Christie audiobooks and audio plays. You get a Parker Pyne, a couple of Harley Quins, one Poirot, and other assorted non-series stories. Please note that this collection is not read by Hugh(Capt. Hastings) Frazier, like most other collections are. And the actor used is not as good as Frazier, at least to my ear. I came here specifically that my library copy seems to cut out at the end of one story (Next to a Dog). The end of the story is pretty obvious, but I'm quite sure that something is missing. I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned it.If possible, I would stick to the BBC Audiobook series - they may have these same stories within their collections."
4,Only one problem,"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my 15 month old daughter. She loves to chew on the spoons and wear the sugar bowl as a hat. The tea parties will come later. The only problem with it is that you can't store all the items inside the tablecloth bag unless you squish them flat. Otherwise, this is a very cute toy."
2,Not worth the price,"This is a book consisting of 14 widely spaced, short essays in largish print, struggling to fill 115 pages and make a book. Though some are semi entertaining the whole book should have sold for about $5-$6 considering the very small amount of content being offered and the relatively unenlightening nature of the material. This book is a rant against casinos and players that the author finds disagreeable rather than an educational or fun book."
2,Mr Scoblete You disappointed Me,Being an avid reader of gaming books I looked forward to this one. I envisioned a book similar to Barney Vincent's Behind The tables with many gaming stories. While there are some funny moments the tone of the book was depressing. The comment that you do not gamble as well when you drink lead me to wonder if perhaps this was written with a martini next to the word processor.
3,A man of grace.,"Arthur Ashe led a wonderful life but also a heartbreaking one. Not only did he have to deal with racial prejudice but also with a major illness called AIDS. Arthur was a true man of grace and his life story in the worlds of sports and political awareness makes great reading. His chapter to his daughter Camera was heartbreaking but uplifting as well. Arthur was not afraid to challenge the status quo and fight for what he thought was right. From AIDS activism to being arrested for protesting US policies on Haiti, he was a true hero."
4,Worthwhile,Arthur had some interesting observations & insight. This man had more physical problems than one can imagine but was able to stay upbeat through it all.It is worthwhile reading for anyone who has an interest in Arthur & or his career.
4,"Health, race, sex, politics, religion, family...","This is a sad yet uplifting memoir from a great man who was taken from us much too soon. Arthur speaks with dignity and intelligence on all the aforementioned topics and more. This is that rare book that makes you feel a better person for having read it.So why withhold one star? Selfishly, I was a bit disappointed that Arthur didn't tell us more about his own magnificent tennis playing. His win over Connors at Wimbledon in '75, for example, was as shocking and historic an upset as you'll see in sports, but Arthur mentions it only in passing, in connection with other events, with no details or insight into how the match unfolded.I suppose he knew time was short and he had many more important things to say.I'm glad he did, and I'm sorry he's gone."
5,MESMERIC!,"DANCING ALONE, by Debi Baxter, is one of the most mesmeric novels I have had the pleasure of reading. Shea Prince, the heroine, is undoubtedly a woman whose propensity for life will lead you through bouts of emotional and physical abuse by her high school sweetheart, Josh Prince. Married shortly after graduation, Shea finds herself with two beautiful children-children she adores and protects with her life. Finding the courage to extract herself from the abusive atmosphere, Shea, without the blessing of her husband, secretly secures a job. Torment, fights and wicked verbal abuse sends Shea into another realm-a realm of security and true love with Gaven Kinkead. DANCING ALONE thrusts you into a world of terrifying drama unfolding before your eyes, the will to succeed by a woman who will not be subservient to a controlling husband, exciting passionate lovemaking, upheavals of matrimonial bliss to a shattering, gut wrenching heartbreaking finality...to find the reader saying, ""Oh, God, why?"""
5,Dancing Alone by Debi Baxter,"This book was so captivating. I could not put it down.I could hardly wait to get to the end.I felt every laugh,touch ,whisper and heartbreak from the picture that was painted with the words of the author.I found myself caught up in the story line.I admire the writter for the ability to accomplish and succeed her journey to get her first book published.She is truly an insperation to all of us that dream of reaching a goal in our life.For Shae,who tells her story in the book.I believe nearly every female has walked in her shoes at one point.I would love to see this be a Hallmark movie.It would be enjoyed by any age, male or female.Although it was sad,It left me with such a good feeling."
1,Switch Not as Pictured,The item pictured on the webpage is not what you'll receive if you order this item. The switch is not as it appears but rather is not offset as pictured. I was told by ACE that I should not order based upon what's shown in the picture! If the picture isn't representative of what I'd like to buy why do you have them? Seems deceptive to advertise one item then supply another and have to pay for return shipping. I won't buy through this portal again.
1,sad,I was saddened they sent me junk you could not play! Do not trust this vendor! Was disappointed i could not listen to this music!
2,The title is misleading!,"This should really have been called ""Our Favorite State Parks,"" because it only covers a tiny fraction of the nation's state parks. For example, Arizona has 29 state parks, but you'll only find four listed here. Pennsylvania has 116 state parks; again, this book lists only four of them. The other 112 parks are simply omitted.The book is attractively designed, well illustrated and printed on glossy paper, as you'd expect from the National Geographic Society. But if you were looking for a comprehensive guide to all the state parks, you're going to be sorely disappointed. What you get for your money is a small, slickly produced guide to the most popular 5% or so--the same parks everybody else is heading for. The other 95% are left out...you'll have to look elsewhere to discover them."
3,Hard to fill but works fine.,Has a nice look and works fine but hard to fill. The tower fills easy. But filling under the roof is difficult. My wife stopped using it because of that.
3,As expected but a little cheap,not bad but some parts fell apart within the first weekI would not buy another one but I do not regret buying it
3,Not study enough,"I love the look of this bird feeder. Unfortunately, we have a lot of wind in the winter and the top would frequently blow open. One storm knocked it off it's post and the clear plastic broke. If you have a protected place to put it, it really is cute and holds a lot of seed."
2,Poor & expensive investment,"I purchased this item in March because i liked the design/concept and the reviews were good. I found it a hassle pouring the bird food in the little square hole and the plastic was very cheap. In June after filling the feeder & putting it back on the pole, it fell & the plastic broke and all the food wasted on the ground. I would not recommend buying this product..but if you do because you think it is ""cute"" only fill the feeder half way...but it is very poor quality for the price you pay!!! Aarrgggghhhhhhh!!!!!!"
5,Redbard Bird Feeder,"The squirrels ate a hole in the bottom of my previous feeder like this and there was no replacement, so had to purchase the entire feeder, Looks great."
1,squirrel heaven!!!!!!!,I hung two of these feeders about a week ago. The squirrels have chewed the silos and chewed around the perches on the silos. They took off the top on the roof and ate from there. All the bird seed fell on the ground from them jumping up and down on them. These were a very poor investment!!!!!
1,Waste of money,Hanging devise provided is terrible. Difficult to fill with sunflower seed. Flimsy and poorly constructed. Hard to believe its made in the US.
3,Red Barn Feeder,"Looks cute. I have only had the feeder one month and concerned how well it will weather. Also, it is a little cumbersome filling the barn area."
3,bird feeder review,"product was as specified, delivered on time and was worth the amount paid.I was satisfied with the product and it apprears the birds, and oft times squirrels enjoy it also!"
2,Hard to fill,The feeder is very hard to fill with sunflower seeds. It also had a strange way for hanging it on a pole.
2,Mostly just another (decent) book on trading instruments,"This is yet another book -a fairly decent one - that explains the instruments that can be used in exchange rate trading. The title and book blurb though promise more - I bought the book thinking it would provide more on general principles of arbitrage, hedging and speculation. It does have some useful stuff on these issues but we would have been better served by more. This is a book at an intermediate level."
4,Original Lead Female Character,"This book is very enjoyable to read. The lead female character breaks all stereotypes and still finds love! It has intriguing plots of espionage, varied characters, imaginable places and plot twists to keep it from being an average historical romance novel. I only gave it 4 stars because in spite of attempts to appear otherwise, the romance falls too much into place, without the sophisticated development the rest of the plot goes through."
5,"New, but great","This was new for Lori Wick. I had already read quite a few books by Lori Wick, but this book suprised me. Not that it was a bad book, it was a great book. It was just that Lori Wick, as I had thought, was a pretty easy-going writer. Nothing extreme. Her books didn't have much action. Not that, that is a bad thing, but this was the first book that actully had a villian. Well, a mean villian. I thought it was cool that Pup was a spy. And it pretty much had everything I wanted in a book. I thought it was so interesting and fascinating I read it in abou 6 hours.(:"
