4,Good classic,the story line i great and I would would watch it over again. I hope to be purchasing the book real soon.
3,have a good time with this one it is a good movie,the sound track is the best and that is what makes this a great movie. I would want to see the blue ray though.
4,"Great movie, so-so DVD","Haven't seen this movie for at least 15 years, now it is out on DVD. It is a great movie, about an engineer (Powers Boothe) who was building a dam in Amazon rain forest. His son was kidnapped by lost tribe of the amazon. He searched endlessly for his missing son for 10 years. It is based on true story. The acting is very good and the location is beautiful. Too bad the DVD can't displayed it properly as the color is a bit pale and dark. The sound is Dolby 2.0 only and a bit let down, especially after the DVD opens with the high power MGM logo presented in Dolby 5.1 and when it plays the film, you can immediately feel the drop in the sound quality. But overall it is a very entertaining DVD that worth considering."
5,Still Spellbinding,"I saw this movie in 1985. It must have made an impression on me because I never forgot it, and it has been on my all-time favorite list for almost twenty years. Recently, I ordered the movie to make sure that it was as wonderful as I had remembered. My memory served me correctly; I loved it! The most mesmerizing aspect of the movie is its' theme of innocence. (Charley B. is so angelic; I just want to take him home with me!) The jungles are beautiful and unspoiled and the Invisible People are free from corruption. I guess that's what attracted me to the movie in the first place; innocence is so precious but on the verge of becoming extinct, just like the people of the rainforest. It just makes me want to cry... I do wonder if the story of the lost boy is really true; I can't find anything historical to back it up. As a matter of fact, the revised print (on the back of the video sleeve) coins the movie ""a parable."" Oh well, either way, it's still a keeper."
1,"Really, really bad","I am astonished at the good reviews this movie received. Not only was this movie unrealistic, but the acting was terrible and the script was awful. I would put it on my list of worst movies ever. I have enjoyed other movies with Powers Boothe, but this was a real stinker."
1,The Emerald Forest,This movie was horrible. I am sorry I purchased it. It was like watching an old B movie with a low budget and bad acting. I got the feeling it was strictly a venue for the writer/director to view and film [...].
4,Don't throw away your videotape!,"The DVD version of this film is bowdlerized. It is an annoying downer, when the widescreen and the picture quality of DVD make the DVD version preferrable in every other way.The other reviews have adequately covered the film. Yes, it is uneven, and the ending strains credibility. Personally, I didn't care for the drug-use aspect either, but for the combination of adventure and spectacle and human relations, this movie is hard to beat."
5,The Emerald Forest,A great movie that will keep your attention. Fantastic story and scenery. Made in 1985 and still fighting to save the rain forest.
1,The Emerald Forest,"We had The Emerald Forest on VHS. It was our favorite movie. All of our friends that we shared the movie with, loved it also. We were very excited when it finally came out on DVD. The quality of both the audio and visual on the DVD edition of this movie are the worst that I have ever seen. We watched it one time, then took it to Goodwill. It is disgusting to see a movie as beautiful as this one ruined by such sloppiness. Whoever put this rip-off of a DVD on the market should be sued."
3,Interesting Early Work By Chester Brown - Terrible Binding By Drawn + Quarterly,"This is the early work of Chester Brown. Angry and full of humour. It is only when the biographical begins to be explored, do the stories really take off.However, the binding is terrible. Cheap glue which does not survive a single reading (and I read carefully). The book literally falls apart during the reading of it. Be warned."
1,Really?,I just have to counter all these gushing reviews. These would be lame in a college newspaper. You ever watch a bunch of student short films? Then you've read this collection of comics.
4,Excellent for Cultural Literacy but Weird Hyphenation,"""50 Famous Stories Retold"" provides an excellent and age-appropriate introduction to many of the well-known tales from Western Civilization especially Greek and Roman history.The one thing I found odd about this particular version is that there are extraneous hyphens all over the place. It happens several times per page."
1,All about male heroes,"Looking at the table of contents, this book is almost exclusively about male heroes and adventurers. Not good inspriation for young girls?"
5,If there is anythingworth a dvd player...,If there is anything that makes it worth buying a DVD drive for ur computer or for your tv then this is it! This is the funniest Flash Animation DVD EVER! Featuring the greatest artists alive The Camp Chaos Mafia!
3,Slightly disappointing,"I think the content included on the DVD was hilarious, but there are only a few of the ""Napster Bad"" series (noted by the review as the ""best of Napster Bad."" But why? There should have been plenty of room to include a COMPLETE ""NB"" series. Still, I'm happy I made the purchase, just bummed that they left some of the Napster stuff off. :-("
2,Not compatible with PCI-e cards!! Beware,"I used this motherboard to build a barebones, dual-core system. Everything works fine, until I wanted to add a video card. This board does NOT have a PCI-e slot (x16). It only has a short, stubby PCIe1 connector. I found almost zero video cards that use this style slot."
5,Very reliable,"I have a barebones ""drone"" machine that stays on the net 24/7. I've been running this motherboard non-stop for the past 2 years, 24/7 through summers, winters, humidity, dry weather, dust, etc. The board has certainly stood the test of time and is very reliable.However, you should note that I don't have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, or speakers hooked up to the board. It is connected to my home network / LAN, and I control the computer over the network with a remote control software program called UltraVNC. I have attached a keyboard, mouse, speakers, and (onboard video) monitor in the past and they worked fine with this board."
3,good for beggining,"A nice start I must say.She looks better then she sings,though her voice is OK.My favourite is Dieu m donne la foi"
5,Amazing little facts about all types of women.,"I thought that this book was fabulous in that it gives testimonials and techniques that anyone no matter their experience level can do. They talk about everything from masterbation, to G-spots, to positions and give the pros and cons of everything you can think of. I have read books in the past that made me feel inadequate because I am not a circus act or contortionist who can wrap her legs around her shoulders while standing on my head. This book seems to have the average woman in mind when it gives suggestions and I really thought the illustrations (drawings) were accurate and easy to follow. But one must remember that both parties need to be in the mood for this, not just the woman. This is a great tool for men as well because it gives detailed info into women's sexuality in non-medical terms. Both my partner and myself found this book to be the best we have come across and enjoyed it immenseley."
2,This was certainly not one of the best,"I got this book because I thought it would have had new incite into the world of female sexuality. It did not. It covered the ground covered by a dozen other books which are like it, and could not even cover its own statement very well in the end. I was really disappointed in this entry. It was too short, and left too much out where it really counted. It was written in plain english and seemed to try to make a statement for women and learning new types of sexual subjects, but it really fell short of delivering a clear message. I expected more from a book with this title, but it only goes to show that you cannot tell a book by its cover. The text seemed to bounce along at a quick pace even when you wanted to learn and read more on a specific subject. It wandered some, and did not present a clear definitive narrative on anything that it covered. I do not think it was worth the asking price either."
4,This book was full of comfort and ideas!,"This book had much to say about a woman's sexuality. While I read personal statements by women, and in some cases by their partners, I felt that I was not alone in my sexual thoughts concerns and desires. I would recommend this book to any woman or man interested in an emotionally and sexually satisfying intimate life."
2,Didn't work for me...,"I read the book, and tried most of the suggestions, but it didn't seem to do me any good. Then again, I also couldn't get my husband to cooperate. Oh well..Back to the drawing board!"
4,Continuing the History of South of Main,I was very intrigued with all the information about the South side of Spartanburg. I lived there from age 9 until age 17 after I graduated from Carver High. I was not aware of how the area began. Neither was I aware of the role that some of the residents played in establishing the neighborhood. I am looking forward to a sequel to the book that will tell the story of some of the other people that played an important part in establishing the city.
5,The Art of Bonsai Design,"Colin Lewis' book is full of clearly written information on ""how to do it"" or ""how not to do it"". I have found all kinds of tidbits of info that will greatly enhance my own activities with bonsai. His material on mychorrizae is excellent.In all, I guess I have found his writing style and his knowledge base combine to provide a book that I will return to often to direct my care and design of my trees. I find this book a real must for anyone beyond the beginners stage."
5,great workout short,this short has freedom of movement and you want that when in the gym. It's also very comfy.
4,great short,"Bought these for my daughter that plays volleyball. She said they are comfortable, but do ride up your leg. But I dont think there is a shorty short that doesnt. She has adidas too and they do the same."
5,Love these!,"Perfect short for physically demanding exercise. Love the 2"" in-seam, anything more is just too much coverage for me. I use them for biking and running."
3,Somewhat unexpected treasure.,"This flick would be completely unremarkable were it not for Hopkins' performance. He is by himself for much of the film as a philandering lawyer. These scenes shine- where he proposes scenarios for murdering his wife(Blythe Danner) to his imagined father- whom Hopkins also plays in a Parent Trap-esque split screen. Other than that it has that cheesy TV movie flavor- it's hard to believe this was made in 1985, it looks like '75. If you've got an evening to burn check it out."
3,Not Horrible,Set on a very dark asteroid.Set on a very dark asteriod(i know-what else would a asteroid be!)The special effects as with many sci-fi/horror movies are the realstars.The character developement is betterthan most in my opinion.The actorsreally appeared to be enjoying them-selves-especially the german castaway and the female securityofficer.The gore was tolerable and like inmost of the genre if you just quitthinking and enjoyed it was well worth the time.
2,Film Quality is Terrible,"The story line/plot was interesting but it looks like it was recorded with poor television reception and maybe bad tracking. We did manage to watch the whole thing (like I said the plot line was interesting) but it immediately went into the ""give away"" pile after we finished it."
1,RIP-OFF,"BUYER BEWARE! If the DVD I got wasn't a pirated copy, I'll eat it....I liked the movie back-when - so for $4+ how could I go wrong? VERY MUCH SO....It started with a still of Anthony Hopkins in gruesome facial expression (no relation to the movie!)...continued with no credits of any kind...the picture quality was the most atrocious I have ever seen on DVD...grainy, washed out....it was AWFUL! The manufacturer on the DVD case did not match the manufacturer on the DVD. I thought Amazon would be interested....so I let them know...but got the 'pass the buck' to the initial selling company. Well for $4+ I didn't want to be bothered, so just threw it away....so much for the scare-tactic warnings at the beginning of DVD's!!!!"
1,AVOID THIS DVD!,"Avoid this DVD! As another reviewer said, it's remarkable bad. I wish I'd read his comments before I bought mine. I recommend buying instead a used VHS tape from a rental store. Its quality will be far better than this DVD.The DVD is a poor transcription of a second- or third-generation videotape. It has the tape's tracking problems. The colors are very weak. It is blurry to the degree that you want to say it has *no* resolution. The audio is terrible. Besides being blurry, we had to adjust our volume control to full volume to be able to hear much of it."
2,A major technical disappointment.,"I suppose it's a good vehicle for Hopkins, but the DVD version suffers terribly from technical problems. The audio track is weak and the video looks like a twice copied VHS tape. I couldn't get past the poor technical quality to really enjoy the film."
2,terrible video transfer,"I had hoped that the criticisms of the DVD quality did not apply to the later 2001 edition of the 1985 film, but it is blurry and hard to watch. I remember the film from years ago and it came through on VHS tape (rented) very well."
5,Unexpected!,How a writer gets into the head of a 15-year old is a wonder. The story was carefully crafted and kept me guessing. I highly recommend it.
4,Very Knowledgable Vedio,"I found the Field to the Freezer Expert Guide to Butchering and Game Processing very informative. The step-by-step instructions as well as the way the butcher explained the process was unbeatable. For some one who has never butchered a deer before, it was not as daunting as it could have been if I tried to do it on my own, using only a book to guide me! I just wish you could have shown how to field dress the deer first."
2,Beginners Guide,"This is a decent video for the beginner to get an idea of where and how to make cuts. For the more experienced, it provides very little information on specific cuts of meat and how to preserve them during the butchering process. There is very little shown on cleaning the meat of veins, sinew, ect, but as expected from a quick and simple video."
3,Good info but..,"T&M appears to be experienced in video production, but their choice for a TV oriented venison butcher could have been better. Garry Zick is knowledgeable about his trade but he is very difficult to listen to(zzzz). He frequents the use of the uhh word so much that it become mind numbing after about 15 minutes. Besides that you will learn how to process a deer from start to finish, just put on the coffee before you watch."
2,Useful but disappointing,"The instructions actually begin inside a freezer on a deer that is already gutted! No instuctions on how to gut the deer are included in this video. It would be more appropriately named ""A Documentary on the skinning and meat processing of a gutted deer.""The narration by Tim & Mike is better than the average Youtube video. They have a fairly well defined idea of what they want to say and demonstrate with the video but leave much of the action and instructions up to the actual processor/butcher himself. The butcher offers many good tips and narrates his actions well. The actions do not always show up on the video as he narrates what he is doing."
1,If you want a good laugh,Well...This movie was interesting. The Star Wars music at the end action scene was a diffrent idea. Also the 3D shots are kinda funky to watch. A good buy for a good laugh.
5,Hilarious and poignant!,This book is hilarious and poignant. Lorne is surely set to become the next P.J. ORourke!
1,Picture of Christ's Love,"The love of Christ in my husband is what saved my marriage. My husband waited patiently for me to stop cheating, showed his love and devotion daily, and forgave before I asked for forgiveness. There was nothing tough about his unconditional love for me. We are more in love than ever before and cherish each other. He extended love to me I didn't deserve when I didn't deserve it...when I was deep in sin. Isn't that the picture of Christ's love for us? That very act of love on his part won my soul over to God.Understanding the Bible and God's nature is a good way to start on fixing your relationship and knowing boundaries.If you want a good book with good advice, read your Bible. If not, contact No Greater Joy Ministries and they have biblical books listing scripture after scripture. May God bless all you struggling in your marriage and give you unconditional love and strength to endure. The power of His love is amazing."
5,EXCELLENT CHRISTIAN HELP FOR MARRIAGES IN CRISIS!,"Thank you Dr. Dobson for writing the perfect book for marriages in crisis! While my husband wasn't having an affair with another woman, he WAS having an affair with drugs and irresponsibility. Your book helped me kick him out and he was forced to hit bottom. I am proud to say that he quickly learned what he was going to lose and has changed his life for the better. As a Christian, it was very hard to swallow the act of separation (and possibly divorce). Through prayer, God does change things! Read this book if you have a spouse who is being disrespectful! It will change your life for the better."
5,Well worth after all these years!,I read this book when it was first released and I am still recommending it to people today! This book allows you to take a long hard look at your relationships and how YOU respond to them. Dr. Dobson offers some sage advice that can be used is a variety of situations.Well worth reading! Best wishes and good luck in all your relationships!
3,Only helpful regarding cheating,Not the right book for my situation. If you're dealing with an affair this may be helpful. Not what I needed
3,50/50 So...So...,"It was hard to rate this book. Love must be tough was very one sided to me. It only focused on adultery and infidelity. In my estimation the book should have included more excerpts on how to recover in a marriage where there are extreme differences, fights and indifference, rather than only focusing on the ""unfaithful spouse"". Every time I thought Dobson would go that route, he returned to the problem of infidelity. For crying out loud there are other reasons for the break down of a marriage. On the other hand, the opening chapters on panic and appeasement were good and could be widely applied."
5,What a book,"I'll make this short and simple:I really like Dobson, so obviously I'm going to like this book. I am only 20--male--not married. I've always felt that in high school there should be a mandatory class that taught at least some of the basic facts about child raising and marriage.I feel this book should be read by those of any age could learn of this book and try to take aspects of it and funnel it into every day life. Even if you believe you aren't going to marry, this book is a wonderful lesson.Buy it and buy a highlighter!"
4,Good book for troubled marriages,"Good book for those in troubled marriages and seeking to try to save it, if possible. It goes into how we play a role in creating the situations we're in with our belief systems, our behavior and reactions to others' behavior. From a Christian perspective; gives people who are those betrayed in a marriage a better understanding of their 'rights' and how to stand up for yourself and create the greatest possibility of getting what you want (happy, healthy marriage with respect, integrity and honesty)."
5,God inspired the truth in this book!,"As a recent newlywed, my husband and I have had quite a rocky time of it so far. I had reached the brink of myself as I could see my marriage dying, when really it hadn't had all that much time to grow. My husband wanted out and I didn't see to be able to change his mind no matter how I tried. In this book, I was encourage and discouraged to read so many situations like mine, but then I read about a simple principle to free my husband from the behaviors that were trapping him in our marriage. I even felt more in control of who I am and the overall situation. Amazingly, within just a few days, he began to respond to me again and seek truth from the Lord. I have never read a book that changed the course of my life so drastically. While we are not completely through our struggle, I did find ""new hope for families in crisis."" Praise God!"
2,This one nearly killed my marriage,"This one nearly killed my marriageIt may work in some situations but be careful when using this strategy. My spouse separated from me. I wrote the ""goodbye"" letter like it suggested and it turns out all my spouse wanted was the opposite. My spouse wanted love and to know that I wanted to stay married.This may be the way to go in some situations, especially blatant adultery, but be careful.To be fair I have yet to find a good separation book. Maybe there are too many variables in that sort of relationship dynamic but it's not out there so far. I would try the five love languages, if he/she is still home or maybe love and respect for the woman who's man is on the way out."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,Super useful and real.We can understand more clearly the love dinamic .The examples are very good becuase through them we can learn the perfect way to manage our own problems.Thank you very much for this instructional and inspirational book.
2,Love Must Be Tough: New Hope for Marriages in Crisis,This book was disappointing to me. It seemed to lend toward a victim mentality. I did not find it accurate or uplifting.
2,This book confused me,"I think that this book and philosophy would work for some people, but not for me. I especially did not like what he said at the end of the book. He encouraged people to take back their cheating spouses, even if they can't trust them again. And forgive me if I am wrong, but isn't taking back someone who is mistreating you, even if that person changes, showing that you don't have self-respect?"
1,AVOID BUYING,"This movie is total crap. I have been to Tensegrity Workshops and listened to Carlos in person. I was hoping for more incite on what went on behind the scenes. No, I was not part of the ""elite"" group. What you get is someone's poor attempt to ""cash"" in on the Don Juan $$$$ wave. Watch the free clips at [...] and you will basically get the whole movie for free. Very disappointing and if you see a rating higher than 1 star (generous) it is because they somehow are profiting by you buying the video (I'll sell you my copy)."
1,Worthless amateur production,"Although there are a few minutes of interesting interviews, they are accompanied by pathetic nauseating graphics and weak embarrassing music. Most of the background graphics are actually generated by the iTunes default music visualizer. It is surprising that such a low quality product ever saw any distribution. It is an insult to the memory of a fascinating and compelling author and character. I rented it and will demand my money back. An annoying waste of time."
2,Nothing of Significance,"Not too good. The poor production and distracting music and computer effects did not help. This thing went on and on, and more than once I wanted to turn it off. However having attended a good number of Carlos' classes I wanted to see if there was anything of significance (which there wasn't).Basically interviews with people who had some contact with Carlos giving their personal opinions. Only one, Amy Wallace, had something interesting to say and I would have liked to have heard more from her. The rest were people who attended, tensegrity classes, either at seminars or the small classes, as well as others who did not. One of the interviewees, a Victor Sanchez claimed in his book to have met Don Juan and learned from him. But curiously this wasn't mentioned at all.Only 2 photos of Carlos and 2 very short soundbites. Overall the movie was quite weak. Barely a 2."
1,Disappointed,This movie is supposed to be about Carlos Castaneda.But it really is just an assortment of interviews with unknown disenchanted people who are trying to debunk Castaneda and his teachings based on heresay and rumor.Having studied Toltec teachings for many years I was shocked at the poor research done on this documentary.If you are a student of Castaneda this will leave a very bad taste in your mouth.The makers of this film showed total irresponsiblity in not verifying the information being presented.
3,interesting documentary,"I think some of the reviewers have missed the point of the documentary. The documentary doesn't debunk Castaneda, it simply points out that some of his followers became too dependent upon him. I've read his books and his entire point is to find yourself and free your mind, but some Castaneda followers simply turned him into their guru and stopped being anything. Now if you're looking for great insight into his philosophy or how to practice his ideas then this documentary will disappoint, if you're looking for a documentary that shows you the type of people who become followers -- think Jonestown, Koresh, etc. then this film is interesting."
2,Annoying DVD Trailer!,"Well, I have to say this DVD put a bad taste in my mouth right from the start. This stupid DVD makes you watch a 3 minute movie preview before the real movie even starts. You can't forward, rewind or skip it in any way, and I resent the utopian programmer who thought it was a good idea to force customers to watch a preview for another film. It certainly doesn't make me want to go out and buy their other movie. In fact, it makes me wish I never bought this one. Stupid idea guys!"
1,Cheap production.,"I enjoyed hearing Castaneda's own voice and listening to the interviews but the cheap druggy visuals in the background and ""experimental"" video techniques were distracting and bothersome. I became very tired of it early on. The makers of this work could have shown some interesting material of the places Carlos talked about in his books. (Or any of a number of more interesting visuals than what we get here.) Forget this work and check out the Sustained Action website for more interesting material."
5,The Jumpstart I needed,"Experiencing God has been a great ride. I've really drawn closer to God through the experience. The key to the book is to not read it but to work through it. Take it at your own pace, my pace was a chapter a day to augment my time with God. The book is not a wordy scholarly read but more of a workbook where Henry Blackaby asks some tough personal questions that we often think about but rarely answer with honest hearts. The whole idea behind Experiencing God is to find out how to interact with God and how he interacts with you."
4,Experiencing God,"This book is a MUST read. It helps the ""lay"" person understand WHY God put you on this earth. God is interested in YOU alone and wants a personal realtionship with YOU."
5,"Excellent study, I highly recommend it.","Experiencing God will enable the Father to draw you closer to Him. Find out what the will of God is for your life and how to get in on it. Teach it to your Sunday School class, your church staff."
5,This book helps me a lot in my spiritual journey with God,"If you want to have a closer relationship with God, pls consider getting this book because it just teaches me how to experience God in my daily life. My faith in God has been strengthened after reading this book. I start learning how to adjust my life to fit into God's will, rather than into my own personal desire."
3,Some Good Information. Repetitive.,"There are some really good principles here. The theology of the book is apparently good. Why the 3 stars only? First the book is repetitive. This easily could have been half the size. The author repeats himself many times and I found myself just wanting to move on. Secondly, the examples are hard to relate too. Like many books written by pastors, the examples for the most part relate to people in the ministry or people going into the ministry. I don't relate to this because I'm not going into the ministry as a vocation. This being said, there are some realyy good stories and principles in the book."
5,Looking for a book that will change your life?,"This one is it! Next to the Bible, this is the greatest book that I have ever read. This book helps the reader return the the real focus of the Christian Life, experiencing a relationship with Almighty God, learning to hear His voice through the Holy Spirit and learning to recognize the difference between God's voice and our own selfish will. This book is POWERFUL, LIFE-CHANGING, and FULL OF DEEP SPIRITUAL TRUTH! I have seen this book change the direction of several churches and bring REAL revival to the personal lives of many people."
3,Good message but a little light,I have enjoyed the material but needed the workbook to really make this a working model for me. I recommend that you get both to really get the most from Blackaby's writings.
2,This book is mixed at best,"This book has some good things to say, but it promotes a dangerous and misguided view of the will of God as it relates to human decisions. For a healthy contrasting view, read ""Decision Making and the Will of God"" by Robin Maxson. People like the view of God's will as described by Blackaby because it makes them feel an active part of God's plan. If you want to experience God in your life, read ""Practicing His Presence"" by Brother Lawrence, and put his advice into practice. I like the Gene Edwards edition, which includes writings by Frank Laubach."
4,Great shows!,"I really enjoyed watching the underwater footage, and the host isn't bad either. THe shows gave my wife and I the inspiration to visit the mantas of Socorro this year, so we're saving our pennies! It was like getting 4 half hour TV programs, a la Travel Channell, but definitely geard towards divers, and the host is obviously a good diver, herunderwater footage is awesome. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a scuba diver, and for people who just love the ocean. Looking forward to issue 2! The production on this DVD is nice, it's professionally done and nicely packaged, the booklet is a mini magazine by itself, with info and stories by the publisher, the host and the marine naturalist person. My only complaint is that this show isn't on cable!Fred Martin"
4,Excellent travel video for Scuba Divers!,"Scubacore Issue 1 is a great video for scuba divers and those considering taking the plunge. Four different dive destinations are visited, each with their own distinct personalities and diving styles. Travel from British Virgin Islands on the Cuan Law liveaboard to the Socorro Islands on the Solmar V. Next the crew visits Yap and dives with mantas and visits the cultural centers for topside enjoyment. Lastly, the group boards the Wind Dancer for another liveaboard vacation to Tobago. At each destination, Anat Grant, your host, gives detailed tours of the boats and underwater life. Sometimes humorous, sometimes serious, but always entertaining, the dialogs and dives are all spectacular.This is the first of a group of 3 videos done by ScubaCore. Issues 2 and 3 are much better than this one as one would expect, but this one is still a MUST HAVE for any scuba diver."
5,Excellent!,"I bought ScubaCore Issue 1 because I wanted to check out the segment on Yap, and before I knew it two hours had done by and I had watched the entire DVD, special features and all. The next day I bought ScubaCore Issues 2 and 3, and enjoyed them just as much. The locations they show are really diverse, and having been to a few of those places, I can say that they are well-represented on the ScubaCore DVDs. The quality of the underwater cinematography is fantastic -- this is some of the most colorful underwater footage I have seen. Be sure to check out the special feature on sharks in Issue 3 -- it's obvious that these folks really care about the marine environment. I highly recommend these beautiful DVDs for divers and anyone who is interested in learning more about our oceans."
4,I long for the '60s,"Would be complete if it included ""Through European Windows"" My album disappeared 30 years ago and I have yet to replace it."
3,A WORTHWHILE BUY,I really enjoyed this book however I felt it should have included a section on how to put a gift basket together for those of us who don't have a clue. I still found the book to be very helpful and worth purchasing.
5,This is a must for teachers and lovers of fine music...,The songs are uplifting and make one happy. Children will love the songs and the story behind how they were made.
1,Disapointing,"I've seen the live theatrical version of the same title. On stage,it's surely one of the best things I've ever seen. But it was with another actor as the main caracter. I love Lepage's visions, concepts and direction, but he is embarasing as an actor. The film is good for the text and ideas, but is a poor version of the real performance."
4,Fine Stewart Western,"Good story, cast and scenery. Of the five Stewart westerns during his collaboration with director Mann, this is the most straight forward. Stewart's character is a man with a past, but not overwrought. Young Rock Hudson in supporting role was a hoot. Great color, no widescreen and have read varying reports as to whether it was shot in widescreen or not. If it is pan and scan, they did a good job of it. But enjoy it for it's own sake. No extras on DVD, but what you get is an entertaining story and for the price, it seems a reasonable deal to me."
4,Another Strong Jimmy Stewart Western Movie,"Although Jimmy Stewart is probably not as well known for the Westerns he starred in, but he is excellent in them. Bend of the River is a good example. He is not quite John Wayne, but he holds his own as the leading star in this 1950s Western tale. Rock Hudson is pretty good in this one as well. The plot is pretty simple - several other reviewers provide the details. Personally I found this Western very entertaining with great scenary, plenty of action, and a decent plot. There are some good bar fights, gun battles, and plenty of confrontation.If you like classic Westerns, then I recommend the Bend in the River. If you think that Jimmy Stewart makes a good cowboy then definitely get this movie. It is as good as The Man from Laramie and Winchester 73."
1,"not a review, but a question","I put this DVD in my player and was greeted with a screen I'd never seen before - a request for a password! Has anyone else encountered this error, or have a way to bypass this screen and go to the menu or movie?Pay no attention to my star rating for the movie, as I haven't had a chance to watch it yet!"
3,This is a decent western but it's not great.,I would say it's good or about average. There is some good scenery and it isn't slow. It just doesn't have a lot of punch as far as I'm concerned.
5,Hardbitten Stewart/Mann Western,"Bend of The River was the second film in the wonderful collaboration between James Stewart and Anthony Mann. This film has all the hallmarks of the collaboration - great acting, literate script, and taut direction.Stewart again plays an embittered man with a past, who with Arthur Kennedy leads a wagon trail of settlers from Missouri to Oregon. The two get the wagon train settled outside of Portland, but there's a need for supplies, and a gold mining camp wants its hands on the supplies as well. Add this to Kennedy's larcenous behavior and you have the making of a great Western.Stewart, Kennedy, and a young Rock Hudson are all excellent, and Mann's direction keeps things moving, and moving in the right direction. The Stewart/Mann films featured characters that seemed real and consequences that seemd to fit the situation. Bend of The River is a great film for all Western movie lovers."
4,Bend of The River,The Movie was good Just as I expected it would be. It is after all Jimmy Stewart. I haven't seen him in a movie I didn't like. They just don't make them like that anymore
1,"Great movie, but a sorry DVD release","Hey, all you DVD video lovers out there... why do buy DVD's to replace all our old VHS tapes? RIGHT! Extra features, restored prints, widescreen format. When will the studio money grubbers realize that releasing cheap, no thrills versions of our favorite classic movies is NOT the way to sell DVD's? ""Bend of the River"" is a classic western and has always been one of my favorite films, but please don't waste your $ on this one. Wait for a truly proper release, not this cheap pan and scan, no features version. What a waste. Ditto for other recent Jimmy Stewart (equally no feature pan and scan) DVD releases of ""The Far Country"", ""Destry Rides Again"" and ""Shenandoah"".Movie = 5 starsDVD = 1 sorry star"
3,Average James Stewart/Anthony Mann western,This is a decent western but it doesn't pack any surprises.There is lots of nice location scenery spoilt by all-too-obvious studio work - but I guess this was the 50's.The best Mann/Stewart western by far is The Man from Laramie.
3,The scenery is a drawing card,"While James Stewart, Julie Adams, and Rock Hudson form an outstanding cast for this movie, what sells the movie is the beautiful, very colorful scenery of Oregon,mainly along the basin of the Columbia River. The story line is basically simple: settlers buy meat and supplies, only for them to be illegally confiscated, and the wagon train leader (played by James Stewart) is, among others, determined to go and take what is theirs. Naturally,during that mission they meet with too many dangerous hurdles: paid outlaws try to kill them, they are betrayed by a ""settler"" (Arthur Kennedy) who wants to join them but is actually a greedy thief and killer, and they meet trouble through the mountains.But the beautiful, breath-taking scenery is the drawing element that maintains my attention. Just that is worth the seeing of the movie. The mountains, the Columbia River, and the topography are very eye-catching. See the movie, for the action and, more than this, the colorfful scenery."
2,Good movie ... worst DVD EVER,"I would like to echo the other reviews here ... Universal has done an incredibly shoddy job on this DVD. The film is a good one ... not as good as The Far Country, but a respectable and enjoyable Western by the reliable Anthony Mann. The picture quality is often poor, and why the movie had to be panned and scanned when it was not widescreen to begin with is beyond me. Cost can't be an excuse ... the Hammer DVD's of The Curse of Frankenstein and The Horror of Dracula by other studios were similarly priced yet far better in quality. Universal should be ashamed of issuing a classic Western in this condition. I want my money back!"
3,A colorful movie of the determination of a people.,A colorful movie of the determination of a determine people toleave their homes for a new part of the country. THis determination is typical of the move west in this country witha good storyline to boot.
2,One Glaring Omission,"The movie was informative, but failed to mention the comedies of Mel Brooks. In most of his work that I can recall, there are steriotypical gay characters, used primarily fo comedic effect. Is Brooks such a sacred cow in the entertainment industry that the film makers were too fearful to point this out?"
5,Must,"You must get this documentary. It's incredibly entertaining. There's one thing I don't agree with. They talk about Jane Russell singing among half-naked gymnasists on the boat of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. They don't even look at her, that doesn't make them automatically gay. I mean they don't even look at THEMSELVES! Anyway, I've seen it more than 5 or 6 times and everytime it's like I like it even more. I love the montages by theme, especially the deaths of the characters, chills run down my body."
5,Informative and witty!,"Illuminates an often ignored part of film history, educates, and makes the audience laugh. In short, the perfect documentary!"
5,Absolutely Well-Done,"This is a historical fiction set during the American Revolution, centering around a British officer (""Officer, Mohawk, Lover, Spy"" says the subtitle), named Jack Absolute. (The name is from a Sheridan play --the playwright appears in this story --he apparently ""stole"" the name of his friend for the character.)Despite the trappings of farce and humor, the writing is (to me) lovely and straight-forward, with the characters themselves having all the wry wit and humor. Jack is a stand-up guy who has reasoned views of various personalities and both sides of the conflict.He's set up as a larger-than-life character, and does have the background and abilities to back it up, as well as finding himself in incredible situations that just add to the glamour --and yet he remains very human and knows it. I really enjoyed how such usually clichéd situations and characters are dealt with in a fresh and interesting way."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This is neither historically accurate nor true to the character of the Sheridan. Jack Absolute has been hijacked and turned into the author's Marty Stu! This is nothing more than published badfic, made possible by the character's public domain status."
5,A classic and beautifully recorded Dorthy Sayers mystery.,"Ably narrated by veteran British actor Ian Carmichael, Dorothy Sayer's dashing detective Lord Peter Wimsey is once again caught up in the murder and mystery in this superbly recorded, complete and unabridged audiobook edition of Strong Poison. Originally published in 1930, this is the mystery novel wherein Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Van's complex romantic relationship is revealed in detail. Strong Poison is a ""must"" for all Dorothy Sayers fans and will serve to introduce a whole new generation to one of the most enduring and endearing characters in the annals of ""who dunnit"" British mystery canon."
4,NOT POISON,"My initial impression was that Sayers gave far too much information on the trial of Harriet Vane. However, the witty characters of Lord Peter Wimsey and Miss Climpson caused me to become hooked."
5,Greenleaf's Best,San Francisco p.i. John Marshall Taner is back on the case and this time he takes a case that seems simple enough but propels him into a conclusion that will forever change his life.He is hired to find a seragate mother for a couple and 2 months after he does so the young woman vanishes after the embryo had been implanted.John quickly assumes that the woman found out the identity of the parents and for soom reason fled but the anxious couple feels she is hiding for ransom of their child.John begins to investigate the couples family and history only to find the unexpected.A superb ending plot twist...well maybe not as dramtatic as Greenleaf's Past Tense but this book is a winner.
3,Does not come close to the greatness of the book,"I think the book by Frederick Forsyth is a marvelous story... so well thought out and presented. I have read probably a 1000 mystery/adventure books in the last 20 years (I threw out my television about that time) and I would rate this book amongst the top 5 books I have read.However, this review is about the movie and while the movie may be mildly entertaining it does not encompass one quarter of the greatness of the characters or the complexity of the book.My advice would be if you want to watch the movie, do so BEFORE you read the book. But, by all means, read the book."
3,Good (if abbreviated) adaptation,"This is a decent adaptation of Frederick Forsythe's 340 pg novel into a 92 minute made-for-TV film. Given the relative brevity of the movie, several plot elements have been simplified or left out, and locale altered. On the whole it works well, will certainly satisfy viewers less familiar with the novel - and not greatly annoy those more familiar with the original work. Elliot's performance is excellent, although he doesn't match my mental picture of Cal Dexter - again a problem of great familiarity with the original work."
2,a so-so movie adapted from a not-so-good novel,"this is strictly a dvd production not good for the big screen. a very mediocre screenplay originated from a meidocre novel by one of the once-upon-a-time greatest novelists. sam elliot was a very bad casting choice, he's way too old for this action movie, he looked so tired to move around in almost all the locations. and the on and on flash-backs were the worst and the oldest directing and editing technique to be used in this bad movie. the cia and the cia operatives also looked so lame, so stupid and so unconvincing, they're just a bunch of wimps. the connection between cia and that bosnian mass murderer was also too contrite to be convinced easily. a brainless screenplay worse than the original bad novel."
4,Easy to learn,"I bought this for my daughters 10th birthday party. It was easy to learn and there are plenty of different dances. We learned the dances before the party and then that night with the disco ball and bubbles going, we taught the kids at the party (boys and girls), everyone had a great time and danced all night, well till 10:00 p.m."
4,A good book - much more interesting than the usual way,"I have read the first several chapters of this book. It is very good. The way it was written is much more interesting than the traditional way of writing physics books. Although it was somewhat difficult to understand in places, I could usually figure them out after I read them again. Also provides some of the history of physics. A good book for beginners."
3,"just the facts, mam","A recitation of popularly known facts and figures regarding the career and work of H. F. Mosher, northern Vermont's equivalent to Mark Twain. Thumbnail summaries of Mosher's novels, to 2003, and the critical reception of those works. During the paper's summary of Mosher's first novel, the Gothic DISAPPEARANCES, the author's label ""Carcajou,"" the demonically-driven super-zombie of the work, as ""the mysterious old man,"" a phrase not doing the characterization justice and suggesting a quaintness, not found in the novel."
5,An excellent book for those interested in Celtic Designs.,"This is an excellent book for those looking to create celtic designs.This book teaches about the development of illumination. It then goes into the major initials, decorated alphabet, decorated ampersands, the animal alphabet and animal ampersands.The book is best used when accompianied by Aidan's other Celtic Design books. I have 7 of the books in this series and love them all!All in all this is a great book for someone looking to create celtic designs."
3,Better in Person,"After seeing Beth Orton live at Field Day I was impressed by her accoustic solo music, as well as her lively personality. I was so excited to buy this cd based on what I had heard, but was dissapointed when I received it. Very little of the folkish guitar work that I had fell in love with was audible on the CD, and Orton over-layers her work with poppy base and drums. At some points on this CD she reminds me of radiohead (faintly) or Beck (especially on ""tangent""), and at times delivers the folk feel that I found so appealing, but for the most part comes off as poppy and frankly, boring. Though this CD is certainly worth buying for tracks 1-3 and 10 and 11, it lacks replay value.Perhaps I am being overly critical because I had such high expectations for Beth. I would reccomend buying this CD, however, see her live. She is a great musician and a charming personality."
3,Things must get mighty dull in that chill-out room,"This album always gets hyped as folk meets trip hop, which superficially sounds like an interesting meld. The truth of it is, however, that the ""hop"" never comes, and all you're left with is a long, slow trip into tired folk. Beth's vocals, during the very few seconds she manages to perk up, have a similarity to Carol King. Some might view that as a recommendation. The unobtrusive atmospherics make this pleasant-enough as background noise for when you're doing something like reading, but if you're doing something more active (like, say, washing the dishes) you might want a less somnambulant soundtrack."
4,Very good,A U.S. writer called this the best female pop release of 1997. It's a very rewarding listen and just gets better with time.
3,Good Listening Quality,"My brother played Beth Orton for me and I like some of her songs from this album. Mostly I liked ""She Cries Your Name"" with the naked synthesizer beeping throughout--plus the deep and high strings at the beginning and end. ""Someone's Daughter"" is a moving, poppy-type song that's fun to sing along with and ""Live as you Dream"" is light and entertaining. Sometimes however, her songs are just a tad too thin for me, which is why I rated this a 3. Certainly not a BAD album. She has talent and this album is worth buying."
5,Why Have I Never Heard of These Guys?!,"last thursday night, i drove into kansas city from where i live, lawrence, kansas. i went to a concert that had Reel Big Fish and Goldfinger headlining and Zebrahead and Homegrown backing them up. However, the highlight of the show for me was an unknown band named the Rx Bandits. If you like Goldfinger or funky-punk with deep lyrics and great guitar, bass and trombone parts, pick up this CD. My favorite songs would have to be Analog Boy and Who Would've Thought...pick this one up...NOW!"
5,I've probably listened to this cd over 300 times,"This cd changed my life. So many different styles are incorporated into this album, and the delivery is perfect. It goes from punk-ish, to rock, to reggae, all with a touch of the ska. The lyrics to some of these songs are...can't put into words. The sound of Matt Embree's voice is out of this world, so much pain, yet so much happiness. All of this may sound kind of stupid, but that is because I can't find any words to describe how unbelievable this cd is. Buy it, or don't, either way it is still a landmark for its genre, err time."
5,Amazing,"Ok. This album is so incredibly amazing that words can do it justice! Every single song is great both musically and lyrically. Any fan or punk, ska, rock, reggae, pop, etc. should really check this CD out. I cannot comprehend the greatness of the Rx Bandits. Ok."
3,Basic Charger,"This is you basic run of the mill charger. Nothing special but it does do what it was designed to do. There might be cheaper parts out there that weren't manufactured by Ericsson, but hey, sometimes it just pays to buy from the OEM."
1,disappointed,The plastic clings do not cling properly. The stamps fade after a few seconds. The crayons do not show up on the surface. Can not see the writing. Very disappointed.
1,DEAD KICK,"This is perhaps one of the worst ""movies"" I've ever seen. Merely an excuse for some aging porn dropouts to show their sagging (...), and their lack of any kind of acting talents. However, the lead in this one, (whoever plays Adrian Lane) is so bad, he makes the bimbos look good. Not a thing to recommend it, don't waste your precious time!!!!!"
5,For a class,The book was arrived on time. Bought it for to help me pass the class. It was a lot of reading though.
1,Warning - print on demand,"This beautiful book is delivered as a print on demand. Terrible quality interior - like a bad color copy. Dark colors, trimmed incorrectly. The shame is that this book is listed as new. Amazon ought to inform customers what they are getting."
3,Greyfriars Bobby,The story line is weak at times but as a dog lover I could not resist purchasing and viewing this VHS tape. It is an okay movie to watch at least one time.
4,A Gift!,This was a gift for my grandmother who had recently gotten back from traveling to Ireland and while she was there she heard about this and it being a true story. She wanted to see the movie after she heard about it and she loved it.
2,Wonderful film...too bad it's in fullscreen,"After waiting decades to enjoy this film the way I saw it in the movie theater as a child, what does Disney do? They glibly release the DVD in fullscreen format, even going so far as to list one of the ""Special Features"" on the jacket as ""Fullscreen (1.33:1)"". The ""breathtaking Scottish countryside"" mentioned on the box is nearly obscured in the film due to the cropping on all sides.While the image and sound quality are superior to the VHS version, poor Bobby would cry at this fullscreen treatment by Eisner and his cronies. It's possible that this film was done in fullscreen like Darby O'Gill, but a dislaimer in the box like was done in Darby would be nice."
3,A step down from the heights,"A true 3.5 star production. Lots of good things in it, but ultimately a tad tame. Or at least this cat-guy thinks so.I came across this tale while reading about The Three Lives of Thomasina, a film with many of the same actors, a similar setting and theme, but much more heart. This story depends on the sentimental, and pushes the tear-jerker buttons more overtly and enthusiastically. In Thomasina, we watch characters grow and evolve, learning and changing in the process. Here we see crotchety old men melted by a cute and loyal little doggie. Now this is not to say that button-pushing was unsuccessful; no, it indeed worked splendidly. My eyes were quite moist by the end. But while pleasant, this film is just slighter and less powerful. It uses the loyalty of the dog as its hook, and while touching, canine fidelity does compare to the emotional potency of human love."
2,Only OK,"When I first heard the song ""Back To You"" I fell in love. I loved everything about the song, the lyrics, the message, the singer, the melody, I give the song five stars. However when I heard the rest of the album, my interest in the band fell apart.Disclaimer: I'm not a hard rock fan.Since I don't like hard, or grunge rock, I didn't like the album. I thought all of the songs except for ""Back To You"", were only OK, nothing to write home about, nothing original or outstanding. Just OK. Nothing wrong with OK, but hey, it isn't five-star either. So get ""Back To You"", skip the rest of the album, and save yourself 45 minutes, and ten bucks."
3,Average,"The debut cd from Fighting Instinct is nothing special but worth a listen. The first release I Found Forever is one of the best songs of 2006. You Don't Know is good and radio worthy as well. The other tracks aren't bad, and a few are good but this is nothing mind blowing. The booklet sucked though, it did have song lyrics but the pictures were just kids playing around."
2,"Uhhh, where did this DVD come from?","The photos on the cover are of a little girl Hayley Mills and an old man John Hurt. In the movie they are roughly the same age: supposed to be college age.This edition of the movie is recorded from TV or someone's video tape. It's a homemade job. Guess that's why it's only $5.The movie is reminiscent of Never Cry Wolf and other movies of one man alone in the wilderness. Hayley Mills is in about 1/3 of the movie but most of the time she and John Hurt are apart (he's off bonding with the penguins).It's a sort of strange movie, but kind of fun to see. It was interesting to see that John Hurt really was young once upon a time. The time he spent with the penguins was pretty interesting, but don't get the idea that this is a romance. It's mostly a nature film. Maybe worth the $5, maybe not."
1,A film fit only for the true penguin lover.,"This film is a great example of how not to make a movie. The story jumps from England to the South Pole in a very unnerving manner. It is sad that the quaint love story at the beginning is not developed and John Hurt and Hayley Mills never get together until the last 5 seconds of the film. Penguins, penguins, and more penguins. If you are writing a term paper on penguins, don't miss this one!"
1,penguins,"This movie was totally worthless, kick myself for ever buying it. Watched half and through it away so nothing interesting about the movie at all."
5,"Yes, it is that good!","I bought this in '79, put it on the turntable, and that first track ""Sudden Samba"" grabbed me. What a great tune. It's got a solid groove and the organ and guitar just hit the sweet spot. It's slick, but soulful, and it's stood the test of time. My vinyl copy is long lost, but I recently rediscovered the overpriced Japanese CD. I'm a bit torn, as it's somewhat validating to find that a treasured piece of music fetches high prices these days, but this is a really good album that deserves a wide audience and it's a shame that the Japanese only CD release will never find it. Enjoy it, it's a treasure."
5,Must have classic,"I was introduced to this project by my good friend when I was in High School. He was a bit older than me so I relied on his wisdom when it came to Jazz and Rock. This project has always been one of my favorites of ALLTIME. It has a flow that allows the listener to start at side A and just roll through every song, then do it again.I have looked for this project for 30 plus years but I am always turned off by the import price. I still have my vinyl but would love to update to the CD.As for the casual listener, if you can get past the price this will make you and your fellow listeners very happy.P.S.:) I would often see Larsen/Feiten perform this project in and around the South Bay beach cities and Buzzy would routinely turn the show upside down with his incredible solos!"
2,Bugy sofyware !,"I really wanted this to work it, starts of good but then bugs start flying,when the intros for most lessons begin it will race trough what they are saying at an unintelligible pace and then freeze the system causing a crash to my Pentium 4 2.6 ghz XP service pack 2 computer. If you choose to skip the intro to some lessons the will work about 50% on a whole this software runs at about 50% stability meaning you have a 1 in 2 chance of a problem when doing a lesson.Let this be an open invitation to software developers to fill the need that has yet to be fulfilled area for kids 12to 18 and adults who need basic math skills done in an easy to understand way ."
2,"Useless, don't buy","I prepare for the GMAT with this book and studied it through and through. After also reviewing a Princeton Review and taking the actual GMAT, I think this book only covered about 70% of material needed. The CD-Rom tests need constant connection to the internet, which is annoying, and the format does not look anything like the real test. Better go with anything else than this."
3,A fairly good basic description of Mandela's life,"I read this book for a school project relating to black history month. It turned out to be fairly good and made a useful introduction to Mandela's life and accomplishments. The main problem with the book was that it didn't go into a lot of depth, which is understandable because of the young target audience. Despite the book's simplicity, I did find it to be very educational and I reccomend it to anyone under 12 years of age who wants to learn about a great man."
2,Check Errors at microsoft.com Before Studying,"As an exam preparation guide it just about did the job for me; I read the whole book, did all the exercises and practice tests and passed the exam. However, I was disappointed to find so many errors in the book, some of which were not listed on Microsoft's own corrections page for this book on the web, even now, four years after publication. Frustratingly, I also found that some of the answers to practice tests on the CD are blatantly incorrect, leaving me to wonder what to do if the same questions came up in the real exam: give the correct answer or the answer on the CD? On the positive side, Microsoft's Training Kit team responded quickly to my suggestions and incorporated them into the corrections page. I would urge anyone who buys this or any other Microsoft Press book to go to the corrections page at http://www.microsoft.com/learning/support/books/, pencil the corrections into the book before reading and report any unlisted errors that they find."
4,Looks pretty good so far...,"I like the topics they are covering. However as mentioned, some of the coverage seems a little light. Hey a book can only be so big.One annoyance was the example on page 175, the subquery is incorrect as it should be 'Select EmployeeId', not 'Select AddressId'. No wonder someone was confused.SQL Server 2005 is a big subject. This book takes a good stab at it."
2,Extra Content,I passed the 70-431 Exam using this book and a few others. I really like Murach's stuff better though.Philipwww.SQLDataBasics.com
1,Not applicable to the exam as of August '07,"I installed the evaluation edition of SQL Server that came with the book. Then I went through the book, read every page, did every sample test and more than half of the practice items (many were redundant).Then I went to take the test and I was shocked. Many, many questions were not covered by the material in this book! I have a very good memory, and read the book while laid off so it only took me two weeks to get through it, so my memory is not the issue here. Microsoft produced a book and represents it's purpose as prep for the test, but it doesn't cover all the material the test does!Most of the questions were covered so it is possible to pass from this book, but I couldn't.One particularly galling question on the exam involved a port number that was not in the book, I checked.Needless to say, I am disappointed. I hope that if I need another certification the kit is more representative of the exam content."
2,MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-431): Microsoft SQL Server(TM) 2005 Implementation and Maintenance,"Not especially well written and contains many errors, including some questions at the end of each lesson. All the errors were very frustrating and really slowed down my speed in getting through the material."
2,Lots of mistakes,"I don't know what edtion this is, but the first edition has lots of mistakes in them. When I came accross the index chapter I kept banging my head against the wall since the example didn't make sense, sure enough, it was a typo...Go online and find the list of typos in this book. The link is on the CD what comes with the book.I found it easy to read though."
5,Fast shipping,I received the book in new condition with all the training CD's in about 4 days (save more than going buying local)
3,Good book with helpful details,"I bought the book on Oct. 2006, thought I might take the certification test, there are a lot of details steps such as setup database mails, but no coverage on Report service, integration service or analyst services."
3,Just one?,"The conector is fine, but when it said ""Bag"" I thought there would be at least (2) in a package.... Not a good price with the shipping for just one. Sorry."
5,Essential Cinema,"A visual feast in which the delirious style of director Josef von Sternberg equals substance. Marlene Dietrich's erotic power comes to the fore in this heavily symbolic drama about the rise of Catherine the Great. Art directors Hans Dreier, Peter Ballbusch and Richard Kollorsz surpass their wildest ambitions, with cinematographer Bert Glennon's decadent images suitable for framing. ""The Scarlet Empress"" (1934) remains the finest of the von Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations."
4,very good and strange sternberg/dietrich collaboration,"Sternberg's love affair with dietrich is probably at its zenith with this strange and delightfully over the top version of the story of Catherine the great.. It is a fine piece of direction with a very interesting set featuring gargoyles and secret passages all with the very best sternberg lighting scheme... Dietrich's performance is delightful and funny and as suggestive as ever..A note on the print of the film... I will probably sound a bit spoiled when I say it was a little hard to watch.. I guess after seeing the great criterion transfers of early films like M, Pandora's Box, or even Kino's excellent transfer of Sternberg's the Blue Angel I had expected something a little bit better... Maybe the film just didn't sit well over time but criterion normally seems to perform miracles on such films.. oh well.. it is still a very nice dvd for your collection.."
5,I beg to differ,"After viewing the Criterion release of The Scarlet Empress last night for the first time I must insist that the reviewers who so strongly panned the quality of the transfer of The Scarlet Empress to DVD are seriously overstating the problem. It's not a ""restored"" transfer by any means; there are some spangly white flecks in certain sections and the image isn't as sharp as it probably would be in a full-scale restoration, but it's still a worthwhile effort. One awaits a full-scale restoration of this singularly important film but until that happens this transfer is eminently watchable."
2,The Blue Angel is a Red Devil,"This Josepf von Sternberg feature about Catherine the Great's early Russian years was a disappointment to me. He told the story from the point of view of what he thought would attract viewers, and while that is certainly a director's objective, it shouldn't be s distortion to historical fact to the degree this film is. Marlene Dietrich is, of course, Catherine from a girl of 14 until she takes over the throne of Russia after having he husband (the Tsar) murdered. Historically this is fact. But von Sternberg can't seem to decide if Peter (played by Sam Jaffe) is a fool or merely playing a fool who knows exactly what's going on. The photography is good for that era and von Sternberg does well with the technical aspects of his film. I think it just seems too dated for an audience today."
2,Is it or isn't it?,"In a previous review I remarked on what a terrible print of the film was used for this DVD - GREAT FILM, terrible print.Anyone who disagrees, or feels this may now be the best quality print on offer should take a look at the Martin Scorsese/BFI series ""A Personal Journey Through American Movies"". There you'll find a some gorgeous clips of the Scarlet Empress with sharp audio and virtually perfect picture (no horrible ""dupe print"" grain or frame damage like this DVD). The film simply shimers. Presumably this was a BFI print, but it may have been from Paramount - either way, a far better print exists and therefore I'm sad to say that this is proof that Criterion have rather short-changed the buying public this time around.Still, it's better than not having it on DVD at all, isn't it?"
4,A visual delight,"Marlene Dietrich as Catherine II (not Catherine the Great). If the writing's uninspired and the acting only so-so, this is still a very beautiful film. From early in the talkie age, it is in many ways a silent film that just happens to have a soundtrack. (Though there is some beautiful music here also.) But it's a veritable delight for the eyes: Marlene Dietrich at her most beautiful; fantastical sets and costumes; Marlene Dietrich; a cavalry charge filmed on a soundstage, with real horses; Marlene Dietrich; black and white photography used to it's fullest advantage; Marlene Dietrich. Did I mention Marlene Dietrich? Though relatively few people may seen this film, you can bet most directors have, and they have been copying from it for all of it's seventy years. This is a must-have for any serious movie collection!"
2,Curious,"I purchased this one only out of curiosity, seeing how a film was made before the hayes office took over with film vetting,telling us what we should and should not watch. this film was made for dvd, it has copied quite well for it`s age and is watchable, it i amazing how film making has changed over the years, how did they set some of these scenes up. watchable if you are a film buff."
4,Very moving,"About 50 people told me I ""must"" see this movie, so of course I resisted! Finally, I got the video and watched it. Now I'm glad I watched it at home, because the emotional intensity of this film is overwhelming. I was in tears at many times. This movie took me back to a time in my life when I lost someone dear to me.I know that some people may be put off by how unconventional the characters are, but the expressions of love and loss, of hope and despair, are universal.Now the last thing you may expect from Almadovar is a movie about family, but this is it. It is about Manuela's love for her son, and then for the others who wander into her life and whom she takes in and cares for as family."
3,Not Almodovar's Best,"While the acting (especially that of Cecilia Roth and Penelope Cruz) is superb, I don't care much for this story at the point I should care most, the climax! As usual for his movies, the plot is highly improbable, and while that rarely bothers me, I'm growing tired of Almodovar's over-the-top characters -- the ridiculously eccentric gays, lesbians and transexuals, who he then wants to portray as the most admirable characters in the movie. (An effort to ""normalize,"" ""humanize"" them, perhaps? Whatever. Go preach from the pulpit, I say.) What worked in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (clearly a screwball comedy), doesn't work here, where the tone is more somber, and the plot somewhat more believable.Still, I'm looking forward to more from Almodovar. You never know where his stories are going until you've watched the whole movie. That said, I'm also starting to expect all the quirky weirdos, but I don't always look forward to encountering them."
5,I love this film,"When I am feeling down in the dumps or just need a pick-me-up I often turn to Almodovar films. This one is one of my favorites. I would definitely put it in the top three or four of his films...the others being ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"" ""Kika,"" and ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down."" This is a must see..."
4,Mami Dearest,"I never watch film with subtitles for the obivous annoying reasons but something drew me to this film and I am thankful for the wonderful experience. This film was visually rich and stylish, complex and wonderfully acted. It was a character study about motherhood and womanhood and all the delicacies, heart aches and confusion inbetween. I'm not sure what Almodovar's obsession is with drag queens but he's sprinkled a few around to add to the mix yet it suffers in the film, making it feel to slapstick at times. But that's it's only fall. Otherwise its a gripping beautifully toned story about the love of our mothers and the pain of their journeys."
3,Family Ties,"Despite being utterly overrated, ""All About My Mother"" is still a compelling and well-crafted movie nonetheless. Avoiding the ""style over substance"" tendencies that marked some of his work, director Pedro Almodóvar delivers a tight and strong cinematic experience with enough drama and comedy to create a relevant achievement. This is a deep story about mothers, sons, and families (conventional or not), with some dysfunctions and problems along the way. The acting is pretty good, the dialogue is realistic and convincing and the direction is adequately intimate and close to the characters. Yet, the movie isn`t as great or remarkable as some seem to claim. Basically, it`s just a well-told story, not a landmark efort. Not great, or even very good, ""All About My Mother"" is still an interesting melodrama worth checking.Good enough."
5,Painful and emotional,"When her son is killed, Manuela quietly comes unglued and returns to her old stomping grounds in Barcelona, exploring the fragile strings of friendship that bind her to three other women, a pregnant nun, a prostitute, and an actress. There's a quiet sadness that permeates the otherwise melodramatic events in this movie. It's quite spectacular."
3,"Interesting, but incoherent","The problem with this foilm is it's not sure whether to be melodrama or not. The plot is very dramatic and fanciful, (e.g. all the characters seem to form instant strong bonds with one another - a lot of people rave about how the film is a great study of female relationships, but the trouble for me is that too many of them are too out of the ordinary), yet the acting and directing is often very earthy, heartfelt and expressive in a very homely way. So I'm not too sure about what to make oof it really.I think ""Talk to her"" is a far greater achievement, where the film feels far more coherent."
2,A little too pleased with itself,"Barely passable, since most of the people in the film just seemed to be so self-satisfied and in love with themselves for accepting gender-bending and modern liberal sexual mores. It takes more than that to make a good movie. I just had the constant feeling that with all these actors flaunting their sexual liberation in my direction, I was supposed to fall to the ground and repeat ""I'm not worthy"" over and over. It made the typically gay pretension of mistaking ""avant-garde"" posturing for substance. Dumbly shallow. Almodovar's worst, I think."
2,What A Joke!,"I think this is one of those films that people think they are supposed to like so they jump on the band wagon without their brains. I kept waiting for the message, the point, or just a good story. What is this diretor trying to say? This movie is just a sequence of events and characters that enter into the life of the protagonist. You can say that for many good movies but this one doesn't make any sense. It is as if the director had a dream and decided to make it into a movie.This movie proves that clever sets, colorful wardrobes, and good acting dont always equal remarkable movie. There is no alchemy here. In fact, there is no here here.This is like modern art that your supposed to like because critics say so, but it is really a joke. View this movie objectively detached from it's critical contex and accomplished director, and you will be scratching you head wondering ""What was that all about?. Two hours of your life down the tubes."
2,Low Believability factor.,I tried - really I did! I tried to enjoy this film given the subject matter and some good reviews. It started out believable then quickly turned into a series of coincidences that I just couldn't swallow. The main character travels back to a life she led 20 years ago and meets a women who just happens to be in the middle of a situation that mirrors her's at that time and with the same man! In this film people enter each others lives out of nowhere and are immediately connected. A good director could have handled such plot turns more fluently.I certainly don't want to give any of the film away and if you want to escape into a film without giving credence to reality then you'll enjoy this film.I'm an actor/writer so I enjoyed the 'Streetcar' scenes.Interesting plot. Very poor execution.
2,Lost,"As always with Almodovar's movies, I find the acting to be superb, yet the film falls short of making a coherent point or statement. Maybe I just don't get his movies..."
4,"Otra vez, de segunda lengua","As much mainstream appeal as most foreign films about drag queens have, this probably won't reach the U.S. masses, and that's a real shame. This has all the makings of the really wacky blockbusters that do so well here, given that they've got big stars and don't go too far. This may just do that at times, and no one over here has heard of any of the fine actors in it. To stack the odds further, the film is smart, irreverent, and not the viewer-catering inspiration that we so prefer. In fact it's downright sad sometimes (i.e. getting killed by a taxi, aging, and dying of AIDS). Throughout it all, however, this emerges as an absolutely hilarious film. Buy it to scare some compassion into your closed-minded friends."
4,Interesting,"The overall plot was convoluted and controversia. However, overall, I liked the film. If art is supposed to provide different perspectives on issues and topics then this film is art in it's purest form. Well done. Plus I liked the spanish, so the subtitles didn't hurt. I'm still learning."
2,Scattered and COnfusing,This movie was a big disappointment. It opens to hospital shots that have very little to do with anything. Hard to suspend disbelief on the bazaar situations and characters. No depth. It just flys from one bad scenario to another. Poor Script and poor execution. Mediocre editing. ANd finally the subtitles were so fast you dont have time to read them. There wasnt even a little sex to enjoy. ALL in ALL a real flopper.
5,hott!!,I was really happy about my dvd purchase. My dvd arrived just as described. It also arrived earylier then expected. thanks for a great dvd at an awesome low cost and speedy delivery.
2,Great music. Sexy lady. Lousy Movie,Demi Moore as a stripper. Burt Reynolds in a satirical role as a politician with a few screws loose. Smooth and rhythmic sounds from Annie Lennox. What more could you ask for? How about a film that doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewing public. I guess that would be too much to ask.The movie is almost B grade but the performances of Reynolds and Armand Assante in particular manage to keep this film from totally going in the toilet.Watching Demi was a REAL THRILL! Unfortunately though that was about all there is.
3,Average flick,"First of all what I dont understand is the bad reviews I have been reading. Some seem to be pretty irate about this film. Looking at the dates of the reviews, 1999-2003,this movie was released in 1996 and had been on cable and later on free tv,yet it seems like these people lived in a box and then decided to get out and buy it. I'll admit that I have bought this film because I think Demi is hot. For the irate people, do us all a favor and watch a movie before you buy it . Would you buy a car without test driving it?"
3,WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION,Would you pay thirteen dollars (the price of the DVD) to go to a strip bar to see Demi Moore do a strip tease number and then have the chance to see her do it over and over again? I would and I did. Forget the story and all the bum raps this film has received. Seeing her is worth the price of admission.
4,not her best work,"if you like Demi, and I do, you'll see plenty of flesh,but this was NOT her best work as an actress."
5,Demi is so hot,This is one of the worst scripted movies ever. But it is still very funny and Demi is so hot.
1,Read the Book!,"The Carl Hiaasen book of the same name has the same characters and plot, but is MUCH better. I've seen the movie and read the book. The book is much more enjoyable."
5,WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE ?,"Who are these idiots giving this movie 2 stars. Probably some stupid females hating on the fact that Demi gets naked in this movie. I'm a male and I only rented this movie for the T & A. But...I found a pretty interesting movie underneath all of the t-n-a. It's funny and exciting and if your not a feminist and a real male, you'll like the fact that Demi Moore looks good as Sh_t in this movie. Rent it, buy it, or burn it. Get it."
4,Nude and funny,"I went to see this film at the theatre (yes, that was me) expecting to see the latest installment of the ""My career ..., so I will take of my clothes"" series (other installments include ""Embrace of the Vampire"" and ""Full Body Massage""). I was pleasantly surprised by a funny movie.First off, Demi Moore is naked. Surprisingly, I didn't find her ""dance"" scenes too hot. The silicone enhancement moves like a rock statue.Once you get beyond the nude Demi, you find a movie with a funny Ving Rhames and a hilarious Burt Reynolds. This movie introduced me to Carl Hiassen, who is a hilarious author.I actually recommend this movie for the humor more than the nudity."
1,Not Very Good,"I was expecting an intelligent look at the underworld of seedy dance joints and corrupt businessmen. What I got was a story line that a fifth grader could follow and characters with about as much depth as a stump of wood. Disappointing film. This is so dumbed down, even people who like superficial Hollywood stuff will be let down.That's just how I feel, sorry Demi, this one is a joke. Try again."
1,haha you gotta be joking right?,"how the hell does a movie this bad do so good??? oh yeah demi gets naked. the only good thing about this film are 2 things,demi and the end credits"
1,Time for Demi to retire,Demi in all of her silicone greatness cannot bring me to give this trashy film more than one star. What's she gonna do next? Barb Wire the sequel?
4,Demi does Striptease,It is hard to make a movie that would be as funny as the book. And they didn't. Demi tries but the other strippers have better stripper bodies. Burt Reynolds gets the most laughs. Lots of laughs and the movie is worth watching.
1,What was this film for?,"If anyone knows, please send me an email or something.The scenario: Demi Moore takes her clothes off to earn money to support her daughter.The plot: some half baked conspiracy twist not worthy even of Starsky and Hutch.The acting and script: about level with that of Starsky and Hutch.It was not interesting, there was no real suspense. It was most certainly not erotic or even slightly arousing and it wasn't funny either."
2,The Problem,"The real problem with this film is basically the problem that many of today's female stars like Demi Moore, Nicole Kidman etc have. Namely, they deeply want to be porn stars but don't have the courage to take the plunge. So they make films like this and EYES WIDE SHUT that have the sheen of being a ""real"" movie but are basically porn without the money shots. The solution? Stop dipping you toe in the water and just jump in. Hollywood has prepared today's audience so just do it."
3,good story about the hard life,Was done with very good taste.Real good bump and grinds in the movie.Tells the real story of the hard life most strippers live.Enjoyed the music so much I ordered a music CD of the soundtrack
3,lol,"Okay, I'll admit, Demi Moore made a hot stripper in this film, and the story itself wasn't too 'out there', but ultimately, this movie failed to be a great one, some scenes were just too cheesy, but some other scenes were truly funny, especially seeing the stripper's ex's antics. Overall an allright film, so I'll give it 3/5."
1,Striptease (1996),Waited a long time for this movie to come out in dvd keepcase. Amazon say its widescreen lol.. its full screen.. don't waste your money.. Amazon!!! I want a refund for false advertised product both on your product page and on the dvd cover... Why do you not send all dvds back to the vendor when they lie one the covers?
3,not bad not great,it has many interesting things in it but it also is very slow all in all i do slightly reccomend it but the funniest thing is that some people have said this was worse then showgirls.that's the funniest thing ever
3,An adequate detective story.,"I really expected a lot less, after reading the reviews. It isn't a great movie, not even really a good movie, but not a bad movie either. Burt Reynolds was entertaining, but the rest of the principle parts were flat. What salvaged the movie for me was the secondary characters (the daughter, the chauffeur, the aide, and the other dancers). They were a believable group. I actually cared what happened to them by the end of the movie."
2,should have bought in person,"I got this video and the quality of the video is poor.The video freezes because my ""supposed"" new video wasscratched, so needless to say I will not be buyingany movies from these guys anymore. Its a shamereally, because I have never had any bad experienceswith Amazon. This is the first time. Let's hope itis the only time."
2,Avoid it,"I don't see how Demi Moore remains a huge movie star. This movie, like 90% of all her movies, is almost unwatchable. It's boring, very unfunny, and not worth the effort to sit through. Avoid it."
4,A great read,I am attempting to read all of the Sharpe series in order. This is a bit of a problem as Cornwell has gone back several times and added new stories between earlier books in the series. But a lot of fun none the less.
4,Good yarn,"I have slowly worked my way through the Sharpe series and recommend it highly. In particular I enjoy the realistic details of military life and war and Cromwell's concise exposition of the action and tactics he is describing. The writing flows well and he provides vivid descriptions of the action. Though the plots are predictable and interchangeable from one book to another, it is still an enjoyable read and the dramatic tension never waivers. It is worthwhile following up with some historical research after reading his books to compare his descriptions of battles to the actual events. Sharpe's Battle was no exception."
4,Another good Sharpe book,"I think this book is the 12th one in the Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series. In this book, Captain Richard Sharpe and his company take part in the battle of Fuentes de Onoro in May 1811. Sharpe is given responsibility to help train the Real Compania Irlandesa in musketry and skirmishing. He shot two French prisoners and their commander, Brigadier Loup, has sworn that he will have his revenge. Sharpe and his men were attacked at the San Isidro Fort by the Loup's brigade. And the raid is reported as a proof of Captain Sharpe's irresponsibility. Sharpe finds himself used as a scapegoat in a political game. His only hope to save his honour and his career is to lead his men to glory on the blood-gutted battlefield of Fuentes de Onoro.This book, like other ones in the series, is excellent. However, I think that it is not at the author's best."
4,Back from the future!,"Cornwell does a superb job, but for some reason I was not overwhelmed as I have been with the other books. Perhaps, because though Cornwell's dialogue and plot are fast-paced, I've perhaps read too many of them and his books have become too formulistic (off course most fans like the tried and true approach). I still very much enjoyed it and look forward to reading the last remaining book in the series that I haven't read yet - Sharpe's Rifles."
2,The only disappointment in the series so far,"Not a bad story for the genre, but completely out of sync with the rest of the Sharpe series in terms of writing style and characterization. I wish I'd skipped it. Not sure what got into Cornwell on this one."
3,"Sharpe's Battle: Not Cornwell's Best, But A Lot Of Fun","'Sharpe's Battle,' starts out with a bang and then gets bogged down to an ultimatley unsatisfying ending. While this book holds true to the spirit of the series and the attention to historical detail is first rate (a Cornwell trademark,) the wonderful story is sacrificed in Cornwell's attempt to illustrate the battle of Fuentes De Ornero. In other 'Sharpe' novels the battle scenes enhance the story but not so in 'Sharpe's Battle.' Fans of the series should enjoy it but those new to the world of Richard Sharpe would do well read the author's original series which starts with 'Sharpe's Rifles.'"
3,One of the Weaker in the Series,"Another in the long-running Sharpe series, this one starts promisingly enough as Sharpe encounters the nasty French Brigadier General ""Loup"" (Wolf) and his elite counterinsurgency unit, who author atrocities worthy of modern warfare in the name of suppressing the Spanish partisans. After establishing Sharpe and Loup as dire enemies, the book continues through an initial fight, which ties into a subplot involving an Irish regiment of the Spanish emperor's bodyguard. This subplot occasionally bogs things down, and in the final third of the book--which details the battle of Fuentes de Ooro (1811)--we unfortunately lose track of Sharpe for long stretches before the inevitable climactic encounter between him and Loup. Not surprisingly, there's a beautiful and dangerous woman involved in it all. It's one of the weaker entries in the series, but still quite enjoyable."
3,Subpar for the series,"Because this book was written with the movie in mind, it doesn't flow in the same manner as the other books. While this makes the book lighter and sunnier than the rest of the series, it also makes the situation somewhat ridiculous, especially since some of the Chosen Men appear in this book, but then never appear again in any of the books chronologically before or after it. The description of the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro, however, was probably the best in the series, and rescued a subpar story. Read the book for the battle sequences. If a movie could be made with this level of descriptiveness and eloquence, I'd go watch it tomorrow."
1,A very boring TV series,"I don't know about the book, but Sharpe's Battle certainly didn't make good television viewing. I thought the first episode was bad and wouldn't have bothered with the second except that my husband wanted to give it another go. ""Why am I wasting time watching this?"" I asked myself and, since I'm not usually masochistic, I walked out of the room halfway through the episode. Apart from the fact that I found the series boring, I wondered if guns were really as accurate in Napoleon's time as they were portrayed. It seemed to me that every time someone fired a gun the bullet didn't just hit the targeted man but instantly killed him."
3,Titanium Predator wire trace,"There is nothing wrong with the product but I have doubts whether it is suitable for pike predator fishing. I feel that this product is really more suitable for sea-fishing. The wire is very springy and in my opinion virtually impossible to knot, but probably ok to crimp. I have no doubt it is tough and will not kink but I feel a softer wire is required for UK freshwater fishing. Additionally, titanium wire would probably make a good lure trace (as it won't kink) but I would have concerns regarding concerns of damage to a pike's teeth as the wire is extremely hard. I probably won't use the samples that I have. I have given the product 3* not on the basis of the quality of the product but because I think that there are better products for pike fishing."
1,"Great songs, bad mastering.","Well, what can I say, but stay away form this cd. Sadly I've purchased this ""oldie but goodie"" and really enjoyed the selections. But on the end of every song(yes every song) you can hear the turntable it was playing on. There is a loud, humming noise of a turning phonograph player that really should of been faded out. I know others like Ace and Bear have master tapes but with no tape sources, they must rely on vinyl sources, but this is really a bad job of that. Do yourself a favor,stay clear and maybe buy the album,if your lucky, on e-bay."
1,NOT for dremel without needed mandrel,"These discs are awesome. However, they do not fit the regular dremel mandrel. On these discs the center hole is too large for a standard Dremel mandrel and the recommended mandrel will be needed. Myself, I was able to get around this (NOT recommended) by using a very small washer under the set screw for my disc shaft and a very small cutoff wheel that does fit was centered and gorilla super-glued to the bottom of the new disc (again NOT recommended). If your looking for a plug and play disc for your standard Dremel mandrel then this is not the disc to buy, remember without also buying the proper mandrel it's a no-go w/this disc... And for those who find this review 'not useful' Really??..."
2,Dumb show,"This is a pretty pointless episode. The premise seems interesting, but the show itself is lame.Diana Muldaur's character is a big brat and tries to kill Spock, which of course is a crazy thing to try to do. It's almost impossible. It's not a bad show, just dumb."
1,a wasted opportunity,"M.C. Beaton's 'Hamish Macbeth' murder mysteries could have made a good TV series, like 'Inspector Morse' or 'Midsomer Murders' . They have clever plots, interesting characters, stunning locations, and plenty of humorous touches. Unfortunately, for reasons best known to themselves, the BBC chose to dispense with the plots and most of the characters from the books, and instead serve us up a bland soap opera with a Scottish setting. Almost nothing is left of the books at all. If you enjoy programmes like 'Ballykissangel' and 'Monarch of the Glen' you will probably like this. If you were hoping for a good murder mystery series you will be very dissappointed. This series was a total waste of time."
4,and i do like monarch of the glen,"I like Robert Carlyle since seeing him in Full Monty. I like the way he plays Hamish, and i really like Hamish's deputy, He really makes this show fun. the girl could be anyone, but the local oddballs make this show fun. I have read 3 or 4 of the books, but if you just watch the show without a preconcieved idea of how Hamish should look and act, you will enjoy the show for the fun of it. Just like alot of the british comedy. Sit back and get absorbed."
3,Bizarre at first with some improvements later on.,"This is the second of the three series featuring Hamish MacBeth, a constable in a small town in the Scottish Highlands. Series one ended in quite a cliffhanger which this second series just ignores. We are led to believe he must have chosen Alex since they are living together at the beginning of this series, but we are never provided with the resolution of the first series' cliffhanger type ending. This series in particular started off just plain bizarre, but then had some good episodes mixed in. The sad part is that Alex dies, which seems unfair to her character. The writers really could have handled the situation better, which is a serious flaw in the show all throughout the series. But if one has watched Series One, it won't be a waste of time to follow up with this series."
4,"Another awesome Ep,","Very Good one, for their second Ep, they've done very great. indie pop tunes, help you to relax.."
3,Look at the pully before you order to make sure you get the correct part,"The description on the sellers website was misleading causing me to order the wrong part. Make sure to look at the pulley on top of your belt drive garage door opener. Check the number of teeth it has. Then look at the seller's photos, not the description. A good photo is worth a thousand words! This is critical to weather you order the correct assembly."
4,A couple of parts for a few $ vs a new opener for many $$$,"Got the job done fairly inexpensively, fairly quickly. And didn’t have to replace the opener. The instructions were good, and didn’t need/use a couple of the pieces in the kit."
2,Not very impressive,"This music isn't very exciting and it's not nearly as dark as some would have you believe or what the title implies. The song ""Darklands"" sounds too much like Bowie's ""Heroes"" (if you know what I mean) and I get the feeling that's not the only thing ripped-off on this album. Not that it really matters much anyway because there's plenty of music I do like that rips off other tunes.I'm sure many would slag my opinion, but it just comes down to a question of taste and this album tastes pretty bland to me. However, it's certainly NOT true that all of J&MC's albums sound the same and there's 2 very different sounding ones that I would recommend far more than DARKLANDS: the dancable shredfest HONEY'S DEAD and the laid-back, supercool STONED AND DETHRONED."
5,Great sophomore album from the JMC,"I somewhat disagree with the reviewer that mentioned the song ""Heroes"" was being ripped off completely, I have to admit the song ""Darklands"" and ""Heroes"" have similar intros and the first verse of the song sounds similar, but that's as far as it goes. Regarding the JMC they made an art of using past formulas and melding them together and created something special, the bubblegum pop of the 60's with guitar feedback and nihilistic lyrics, nobody had done that before, nobody. I also disagree that this is a bland album, it's slower, a bit laidback, it has lot less distorsion that their debut album, but it is powerful, very melodic, and it stands with similar great albums from the 80's like ""Closer"" from Joy Division and ""Pornography"" from the Cure.Lastly I have to say that most JMC fans agree that their first 3 albums (Psychocandy, Darklands & Automatic) are among the favorites, and in the 90's they fell into the ""alternative"" sound, too common those days."
4,One of their best,"They tone down the feedback of their earlier work and reveal the tunes. Of all their Cd's this one is deemed the classic but if I tend to like Stone and Dethroned and Automatic. If you can only buy one, then go for Automatic, it's their most commerical."
2,Not Much Of A Turn On,"This music isn't very exciting and it's not nearly as dark as some would have you believe or what the title implies. This album has little in common with the surf tunes and buzzsaw distortion of their acclaimed debut PSYCHOCANDY. The song ""Darklands"" sounds too much like Bowie's ""Heroes"" (if you know what I mean - the melody is a little too similar) and I get the feeling that's not the only thing ripped-off on this album. Not that it really matters much anyway because there's plenty of songs I do like that rips off other peoples' music.I'm sure many would slag my opinion, but it just comes down to a question of taste - and this album tastes pretty bland to me. However, it's certainly NOT true that all of J&MC;'s albums sound the same and there's 2 very different sounding ones that I would recommend far more than DARKLANDS: the dancable shredfest HONEY'S DEAD and the laid-back, supercool and mostly acoustic STONED AND DETHRONED."
4,"""Like peanut butter""","While most of this album has escaped my memory over the years, the haunting melodies and lyrical angst on ""darklands"" has stuck in my brain like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. I'm buying the album again, this time on disc, to replace my ruined cassette. I recall it as decent but the ""darklands"" track is worth the price by itself."
2,I have a few things to say about the last few books...,Okay I LOVED it when Melanie got into racing. She was sooo cool. I want her to win the Kentucky Derby a lot! She has been my favorite character since this whole Christina thing started. Okay first of all Melanie should be winning because she got into racing first and Christina hated racing. And you don't HAVE to race claimers for gods sake! She drives me nuts! Her life is on this picture perfect farm and has a wonderful horse( well that she so shallowly sold) and a wonderful colt. And now she's winning all of these races! Her problems are so stupid! Get this series together!
4,Excellent Book!,"This is a very great book! It includes all the trills, spills, ups and downs for Christina, Melanie, Ashleigh, Whitebrook and of course their rivals, Townsend Acres. It has the hard truth about racing and horses and sets a good picture in your mind! Definitly one of the best books in the series!"
4,Was Good ! @ cmavia@yahoo.com,"I thought this was a good book. I kinda like that she and Star dont win all their races. But I think that Chris cries a lot in these last books. LIke every 2 seconds she is crying over something stupid, she is lucky that she has Star and is a jockey. I cant wait to read the new 41-44 books. They sound good. Cindy is coming back!"
1,WHATEVER!,This book series is getting worse and worse! I was only into the second chapter and I couldn't stand the dullness of it. I put it down for about two months and then I tried to read it again but I put it down AGAIN! I never put books down and never twice! But I could NOT stand it! And I know what the whole series has been like because I have every single one! I have slowly watched this series evaporate into dull words on a page. It started somewhere in the teens of this chapter when they got a horses name mixed up! That is sooo not quality writing! You should at least care enough for your series to get everything straight! P.S. The one star is because it is about horses...the only good part of this book!
3,"I liked it, but....","Well, this series is definitely getting better. I like it a lotmore now that Christina's into racing, but it was kind of weird forher to all the sudden decide to become a jockey, when she had trainedher whole life to be in the Olympics. Also, i miss sooo many of the characters in the old books. what happened to the baby Ashleigh was supposed to have in #23? And what happened to Cindy? all it said was that she moved to Belmont. And what about all the horses? Champion, Pride, Shining, Glory, ect. And now that Ashleigh rode in a race again, I was just wondering if Ashleigh and Christina would race against each other. or christina and Melanie. I was definitely getting sick of Sterling, but I thought Christina loved her to much to give her up. And why did Sammy move to Ireland? she loved Whitebrook so much. And for your information, new authors, townsend acres' colors are green and gold, not red and black! but this book Was well written. Keep the racers coming!"
3,UGH! bad book,"I don't get it. In all the books Christina wants to be an event rider and she shuns racing. Now she's a jockey and she's sold STERLING, her beloved horse that she traded Wonder's Legacy for!some of these TB books are so off-track. A great series, but the authors should really stick to the facts."
2,Extreme Peach Review,VERY sweet! Distractingly sweet! Not a lot of flavor. I Love the Jet Tea line....just not this flavor
1,One Star In Homage To Less Enlightened Times,"Yes, this is a delightful tale featuring traditional Southern humor and dialect -- if you don't happen to be one of the impoverished, uneducated black children who add so much flavor to the context. This tale comes from an unfavorable time in our past when racism was systemic in our society, when those of the racial minority were, when convenient, treated kindly -- but always as second-class citizens, and everyone realized that.This book's value, now, is one of education. Read this book, and understand how differently our society once was structured (in law and in practice) from today. Put yourself in the place of those relegated to the back, always vulnerable to the caprice of the favored race. And be glad that (regardless of what many insist) our society indeed has gotten better than during Billy Green Hill's times."
3,Miss Minerva Series is a classic regardless...,"My Mom introduced me to the first two in the series-""M.M. and William Green Hill"" and ""Billy and the Major"". In later years, she searched high and low for the remaining 10 books and was finally able to get ""Miss Minerva's Baby"".Yeah, it is really frought with political incorrectness and a rigid racial belief system that was characteristic of the time and place it was written. However, this series is worth reprinting and keeping as it teaches so much on so many levels that are not just historical.In a rather satirical way, the children in the series manage to unknowingly confront the social intolerance of their adult counterparts with innocent, but brutal, honesty, often leaving them frustrated and dumbfounded in their own hypocrisy. It's worth a read."
5,Wonderful read-a-loud book.,"Wonderful stories of a bad little boy and his friends when he goes to live with a maiden aunt. I have this edition and found an older copy. Probably not politically correct, as the little boy, who although is white talks with a negro accent."
5,"The ""Miss Minerva"" series was one of my favorites as a child","I read all 9 books in this series and enjoyed the humor of Billy's exploits with his Aunt Minerva and the neighborhood children. The children of this era made their own entertainment, played ""pretend"" and spent a lot of time outdoors-life was rather pastoral. However, Billy managed to keep everyone hopping. I'd describe the book as an early ""Little Rascals"" of the South. Well written, humorous and filled with the innocence of the era. Billy and his friends seem to have to learn everything the hard way!! Historically, it occurs in an era of segregation; however, it also demonstrates that children accept each other far more easily than adults do."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The prime selling feature of the Jabra line of headsets is the ""earbud,"" a soft rubber cap that is anatomically designed to fit in the ear. The problem is, the earbuds don't stay on the units securely, so once they fall off, you're stuck with a headset that doesn't stay in your ear and you've just wasted your money. I lost my earbud the first day I used the headset. Why? Because the soft rubber earbud easily snags onto pocket linings, collars ... everything ... and when it does, it pulls loose from the headset and falls *silently* onto the floor. I replaced the earbud and tried securing it with Elmer's glue, and then later, rubber cement. Nothing works. The only way to positively not lose the headset is to leave it in your ear from the moment you wake in the morning till you go to bed at night --- not very practical! Skip this product and save yourself some money and aggravation."
1,in a foreign language it seems more complicated than it is,"I just do not understand how people can be fans of Victoria Holt, or whatever her name was. I mean she wrote the most predictable of books, so, the same formula each time, so that any sane person enjoys one book, but finds the next ones boring. And this book was no different. It was so obvious that all the people suspected didn't commit the murder. That's the way I saw it anyhow."
4,Great reading material!,"Carmel March, left under an azalea bush when very young, has grown up in the house of Dr. and Mrs. Marline and their 2 daughters and son. She has never really felt like part of the family yet always being drawn to the gypsies in the forest. When she's about 11 years old, she's taken away to Australia by Mrs. Marlines brother, Toby, and lives the next 10 years or so there, always wondering what happened to the Marlines. While in Australia, she discovers many things about herself and her real family and when she returns to England, Carmel finally discovers the mystery behind what happend to the Marlines and why she's so drawn to the gypsies."
2,Not the best of VH books,"Yes, I got an impression that from the middle of the book the story was finished by someone else and this was not VH book... The beginning was very promising and very pleasantly told but then the book changed its stile. The book is ok to read but it is definitely not the best and not as gripping as others. I would not consider this a typical VH book."
4,Just relax and read,"You won't take anything of this book but you will have a good time reading it and that is the greatest part of reading a book, the story of Carmel is nice and will keep you reading while she is in England and Australia, when she return to England and discover the assassination the story gets a little boring but still is a good reading, you won't know the time of the book until the last page, I think that that was a good idea.By the way, which girl wouldn't want to have three options of marriage in less than two weeks?"
1,Right cover WRONG book!!,"My husband ordered this book for me for Christmas- I didn't get to begin the story until two months later. When I started to read it, I noticed that the book had the correct cover, but the inside contained a completely different story, ""Berlin Game."" However, it is too late to return the book! Please make sure the story you choose to purchase matches the cover of the book you order."
4,My favorite from Carlinhos Brown,"Some may disagree with me, but I have to say that this album is the best by Carlinhos Brown. I like it much better than both Omelet Man and hiw new one, Bahia do Mundo - mito e verdade. To me, Carlinhos Brown is kind of a Brazilian Lenny Kravitz with a similar groovy, dance-rock style but with a Brazilian spice to it. As with most Brazilian artists, the CD can't get away without having at least a couple slow, cheesy tracks but if you get over how light and pop-y they are, the slow songs on this album are almost good. Other than that one complaint, 90% of this CD is nothing but energetic, artistic, funky, rocking great Brazilian beats. Highly recommended."
4,Tapping into primal energies...Parlas portugues?,"A great eclectic album from this Brazilian talent,'Alfagamabetizado'amounts to a guilty pleasure being capable of satisfying both the intellect and also the heart.Check out'A Namorada',the best song Prince never wrote.All in all this record is one more proof that good music comes from below the waste!"
2,"Lively, slick and empty !","C. Brown is an exceptional musician, but despite all his apparent skill and deft musicianship, his recording left me cold. It is a beautiful Disneyfication of Brazil's popular music spectrum. If there is ""innovation"" on this recording, it is lost in the forest of hyper-self-conscious hipness. Too bad. He'd done so well with M. Monte's recording (Great Noise) that I had high expectations. I was sorely disappointed."
4,Inspires love or hate,"I love this album -- it has an awing visceral impact. My wife can't tolerate it -- it gives her a splitting headache. It's the only album I know that inspires such different reactions from the two of us -- our tastes are usually pretty close. Either way, peoples reactions to it tend to be strong, it seems."
2,Color photographs would be helpful,"This pocket guide is very informative; however, every photograph inside this book of edible wild plants and herbs is black and white. This makes identifying plants and herbs a challenge."
3,It's fine for what it is...,"This product is fine for what it is. It doesnt seem to be as ""air tight"" as they claim (or maybe it was just mine), but it does the job just fine. Its great for normal indoor use. We kept our old dog food in an old iams can, and it started to rust, so it was definitely time to change. They're pretty compact and easy to keep out of the way. Nothing fancy. I'm happy with it, and if you dont have issues with bugs or mold (or anything else that would make you need something truly air-tight), I would definitely reccomend it."
4,Great Storage For Animal food,I got the Vittles Vault II to store my dry cat food. It's airtight but easy to open the round access door because of the large X shape on the top of the door.
4,YOU BETTER HAVE STRONG HANDS,"We just received our 30lb Vittles Vault for our cat food. Looks to be well made and seals tight. The only problem is that my wife and I both have bad hands, and the screw down lid is tough to open. It takes a lot of force. Still, it's a good product.I wish this company also made a wall-mounted food hopper. All the wall mounted pet food dispensers I read about on line have door / flap issues. The Vittles Vault company makes a quality product and would probably get it right."
4,Great unless your dog is a safecracker,"I own three Vittle Vaults and find them to be excellent at keeping pet food fresh and pest-free. There are no insects or mice looking around for free food either, which I believe is due to the vaults as well. The vaults are durable and have survived years of being tossed in and out of the car for trips and being investigated by dogs and cats. Puppies attempted teething, male cats were rude-- the vaults remain uneffected and easily cleaned. Unfortunately my youngest dog has developed a safecracking talent and is able to spin the lid open. A firm tug with teeth on the cross handle in the right direction, followed with kicking the lid counter clockwise with her paw. She's been holding seminars with the other pets, but so far she's the only talented spinner. So, into the crate with her."
3,remarkable until the end...,....where Koestler's solution for global conflict is so patently chemical that one is left stupefied that such a brilliant and creative mind could arrive at it.
4,Totoally Tubular Quilts,The Book arrived before the date given in great condition and the content was all i could have hoped for!
3,Stereotyped Love Triangle in Muslim background,"Even though the movie is based on a work or literature (Dr. Achla Nagar - daughter or famous hindi novelist and story-writer Amrit Lal Nagar) the story is an old fashioned love triangle. The backdrop is different but for the story is rehash of many old classics.The direction is good. BR Chopra weaves the songs too well into the story that they become integral part of the story. The language is very polished (thanks to Dr. Achla Nagar). Everyone stands out in this story!Mehadi Hasan's Gazal ""Chupke Chupke Raat Din Ansu Bahana Yaad hai..."" was lifted without his permission."
3,Best Food Ever,"For any ""foodie"" out there it's a great DVD. Looking at the other regional specialities that change the old favorites we are used to is fun and makes for some great party ideas and possible additions to any resturant menu.I was disapointed that it wasn't the complete series or indicated that it was disk 1. I was really looking forward to the show on ""Cheese"" but that was missing. I hope that the other shows will be forthcomming."
4,Fun to watch but only five episodes,This is a single disc collection with five episodes from the 'Best Food Ever' series on TLC. The narrator for this show is John Goodman(he does not actually appear before the camera).My favorite episode in this collection is 'Fab Food Carts' as it was nice to see hard-working folks who are passionate about food go about making their entrepreneurial dreams into a reality. It was also amusing seeing a heavy-metal pig truck!Overall this collection is a bit short and could have used an additional disc for a few more episodes. But overall what is here is fun to watch and recommended for lovers of food programs.
5,The Best Manics Album Ever Bought!,"'Generation Terrorists' is filled with jingoism, anachism, and nihilism, and Richey Edwards' unique lyrics are full of his hot youth. James Dean Bretfield's voice and guitar liffs are similar to LA Metal, but more energetic and more frank. Manics' 'Generation Terrorists' is a true Neo-Punk Album and a second 'Never Mind The Bollocks' or 'London Calling'. It's the best Manics Album Ever Bought!"
4,Impressinve... to say the least,"Generation Terrorists in the greatest debut album that I have ever heard in my life. This album was way ahead of its time and caused changes in what we know as rock today. Richey and Nicky's lyrics have once again, come together to create an very very impressive album.Slash 'N' Burn, Natwest-Barclay-Midlands-Lloyds, Motercycle Emptiness, You Love Us, Love's Sweet Exile, Stay Beautiful, Repeat, Cricifix Kiss all songs to look forward to. The political filled, youth rock 'n' roll, anarchy chopped lyrics serve the band well. With the glam-rock, Sex Pistols, Clash influences, it all binds to make one heck of an album."
2,Super Single,Sixth form poetry and trashy guitars flower briefly into rock'n'roll genius with Motorcycle Emptiness. They should have left this track off (a) till their fans were ready for it and (b) because it makes the rest of the album sound terrible.
3,Were they nuts??,"An incredibly bold debut release, completely going against the dance/'lad' culture in the UK which prevailed at the time of its release, ""Generation Terrorists"" is a mixture of The Clash, Guns and Roses and the pretension of many of the writers which the sleevenotes namecheck. It never lived up to its promise, and is a little (i.e. 6 tracks!) too long, but has some great moments. Why didn't they put their excellent single 'Motown Junk' on there instead of the rather terrible 'Natwest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds??'."
3,Hmmm...,"Not one of the Manics' greatest works I must say, Generation Terrorists gets off to a great start, with the first four songs being brilliant (esp. Natwest Barclays Midlands Lloyds and Motorcycle Emptiness), but much like something by the Sex Pistols you get kind of bored of the high pitched punk-rockie shouting of James Dean Bradfield, sometimes dipping into the pop-zone (though fortunately realising what the helll its doing and pulling out again). A good album, but doesn't compare to The Holy Bible or Everything Must Go. But at least it's better than (ahem) This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours."
3,adult oriented rock this is not,"You can tell a lot from a band's name. For instance, ""The Manic Street Preachers"" is going to be EITHER something unique, bizzare, contorted, well out-of-left-field (you know, something like Mojo Nixon or Screamin' Jay Hawkins), OR a bunch of slightly whiny, bedsit-dwelling university types who think drippy, fifth form political polemic will do for lyrics.Well, here is a sample of the lyrics from The Manic Street Preachers' ""Motorcycle Emptiness"":""Culture sucks down words/Itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles/Organise your safe tribal war/Hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto/Each day living out a lie/Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever/Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness""You decide. ""Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant With My Two Headed Love Child"" it ain't. More's the pity."
5,DISEASE,We need and we will always needAnother invented diseaseWe need and we are taught to needAnother invented diseaseThere`s nothing I wanna seeThere`s nowhere i wanna go
5,Really good book to help prepare my speech,The outline in this book is better than many others I have seen. I was able to put my speech together much quicker and in a more organized fashion with this book. Great Reference to have in your personal library.
3,Should have been entitled how to WRITE a damn good speech.,"I picked this up as part of my public speaking class required reading. The book is well organized, has some great tips on how to prepare and write your speech but never actually discusses how to GIVE a good speech. It could have used a chapter or two on how to deal with nerves, body language, tips for presentation etc.Overall, not a bad book, but there are much better titles on the market that encompass a broader spectrum of how to prepare and present."
5,Nail biting viewing,"All this series is worth viewing,good suspense and amazing stories,great entertainment.Miracles or just good luck these stories are truly a test for the human bodies determination to stay alive in the worst possible situations, good adult viewing."
5,I'd Buy More Of The Same,Fits well in a crowded electrial box. Nice touch to include wall plate. Night light feature makes it easy to locate in the dark. Dimmer smooth and stays where you set it.
2,Perfect dimmer switch except for the night light / locator light,"This switch matches my new construction home perfectly and would be a perfect dimmer switch except that the dull amber back-lighting (when the switch in in the off position) is unbearable in a bedroom and has an outdated ""grandparent"" look in any other room. An option to disable the locator light at the time of installation or a different model number for the same switch but without the back-lighting would be great but does not exist from Lutron."
2,Dimmer switch,I would not recommend this product. After 6 months the dimmer doesnot work. The light stays on bright all the time.
4,switched on,A very effective straightforward dimmer. The only problem was that the intructions were not straightforward if you have limited understanding of DIY.
5,rock'n'nroll for real men,"This album is a hilarious, live snapshot of what a bawdy bachelor party should be. The Mono Men are as solid a garage/punk/rock band as you'll ever hear, and for a live performance, they nail it. The band photo on the back speaks volumes about how these are your average guys who one might mistake as plumbers instead of the stage destroyers they really are. For chrissakes, if you can't appreciate this album, you ought to consider the old age home. Seriously."
2,"DVD, not! CD-ROM for Windows, OK.","Martin Sternberg is stellar in his field and I was really looking forward to this digital dictionary for those hard-to-remember signs. I don't know why they call these things DVDs, but this is a 4-CD computer set for those interested in learning a little sign language. I just .... don't do Windows."
5,A very touching video,"This video presents the stories of a half dozen people, some famous, some unkown, who came to know God as they journeyed through difficult and painful circumstances in their lives. I have seen this video many times and continue to find it touching and inspiring. It is a great resource for RCIA and adult religious education situations."
5,These guys own the Mooney Suzuki's former record label,"The mono men's sound lies somewhere between Green River and Mudhoney--punkier than Green River, but heavier than Mudhoney. This particular album has become one of my favorites, mainly because it manages to capture the rockin' energy of a live performance. Fans of the current garage rock revival should relize that a similar garage rock revival in the Pacific Northwest occured 15 years ago--planting the seeds for the grunge movement. While the monomen are somewhat indistinct, sounding much like their contemporaries (Blood Circus, Tad, Fluid, Girl Trouble), they pull off a great album, solely because of the band's intensity. Any fan of the grunge scene should check this out, even if they aren't on Sub Pop."
5,Nice,"This is a very nice blues CD. It's just solo guitar and voice, but Josh White's style is melodic and it really swings in a slinky way. I like this CD. Wish I could play guitar like this. Josh White has a very smooth voice and the songs vary and change up along the way - they don't all sound the same - here the blues is touched by jazz, here it's a ballad, there deep plantation blues. But always warm and acoustic, sometimes multiple voice harmonies. Looking for soul? You've come to the right place. Don't hesitate to pick up this baby - it's a gem."
4,"Its not something you do not know, but is amusing how its placed.","We all know that a consumer is someone who consumes and the main if not sole purpose of advertising is how to make you consume more. What the author shows is that the real trick they achieve is to make you thing that your desires to acquire things is a manifestation of your character, freedom and self-determination, while the truth is that you are just a mental eunuch trapped in a web of artificial needs created by ""Inc, world"" to ensure your permanent stupidity and annulment of individuality. However it does not seek to offer an alternative or an immunity pill, just to tell you that ""such is life""."
5,Tremendous,"A great achievement in the rearguard action against global consumerism. There are plenty of echoes of Houellebecq's writing for those fans of his. And while the translation of the scenario from France to England is not pulled off very skilfully, the novel's fast pace and riotous depictions of the advertising world's excesses outweight any such minor flaws."
1,How can you find this funny?,"In Beigbeder's 99F, (published in 2000, since renamed '14.99 Euros', English translation titled '9.99' and soon to be a major French motion picture), the main characters beat to death a retired woman in Miami (after telling her that the only reason that the Americans helped liberate France during WWII was to export more Coca-Cola) while on location for a TV ad shoot. The killers motive is that American pension funds are one of the main drivers behind globalisation. This book is not worth the paper it's printed on."
2,Absolute Yawn-Fest After the First Few Pages,"The start of this book with the triple murder where the victims faces and fingerprints have been removed made for a very interesting and unusual start. I was grabbed instantly and pulled into the crime at Gorky Park in Moscow. But from there, sadly to say, it was all down hill. I lost interest the more I read. Keeping track of all the Russian names and places was tedious, but would have been a non issue had there been a plot and story that was at least somewhat interesting. But it wasn't, it was just plain dull. I failed to see why this book is so highly thought of. If this is the best murder mystery in the genre, then I guess I will be skipping this genre."
5,Detailed and Exciting Thriller,"""Gorky Park"" came out in 1981, so some of the Cold War references to the KGB and the bad old days are dated, but it remains a top-notch thriller. Arkady Renko is a Soviet cop called in to solve a triple murder, with the bodies left under the snow in a Moscow park. As he probes deeper, he bumps into the KGB, a wealthy American fur trader, and a high-level conspiracy dating back to World War II. Cruz Smith spent eight years writing the text, and it shows. The eye for detail, the Moscow street scenes, the historical research and the multi-layered characters all feel first-hand and urgent. That ""Gorky Park"" is a cut above other espionage/thriller novels made it a best-seller when it came out and a decent film with William Hurt."
3,More like 3 & 1/2 stars,"A friend highly recommended this book to me, which is perhaps why I was a little disappointed, as I had very high hopes when picking up this book. While I did end up enjoying the story when I put the book down, it was not a favorite of mine, nor did it compel me to pick up any more of Smith's books.The reading was slow going for me for at least half of the book. While, I normally throughly enjoy investigative, suspenseful type stories, this one didn't grab onto me quickly. However, about halfway through it seemed to pick up, or perhaps I became accustom to the writing style or Arkady character. Simply put, the plot kept me reading, because I did begin to care enough to see what would happen at the end. I was glad that I did, I did start to enjoy the characters and story a bit more, and I was happy with the ending. In addition, the book does not lack mystery and suspense.Overall, not a bad read, but not an author that I'd pick up again. Just not my type, I don't think."
5,Meet Arkady Renko,Well that's where you can met Arkady Renko so many years ago and decided to love or hate his tormented Russian soul.This is a mystery about a detective who just won't stop investigating a murder despite all obstacles thrown his way.It's a somber book about somber times in a depressive setting but still a joy to read.
3,Not as good as the next few in the series,"I liked Gorky Park, but I found it somewhat confusing and rambling at times. I did like it enough that I read the next two in the series, and I have to say that I adore the main character, Arkady Renko. He's just a wonderfully wry and complex protaganist. I also find it amazing how the author is able to portray life in Russia during different time periods. I do highly recommend these books--but if you find yourself slogging through Gorky Park a bit, keep going!"
3,"Like reading 2 stories, neither that good","I had really high hopes for this novel. I actually enjoyed the film, though it was flawed. The reviews were universally popular too. Yet I found the novel slow, disjointed and rarely involving.The initial mystery of the bodies in Gorky Park is quickly solved and forgotten. In fact, the story is really not a thriller at all. The film is much tighter and thrilling even though the rather tedious and unbelievable sable story is similar.After the initial Gorky Park killings the film meanders without direction as it develops into a romance. The romantic plot is okay though never convincing. It also ends abruptly and in a less than convincing manner given the previous chapters.The story really falls apart towards the end as Renko is holed up in a country house outside Moscow before going to the US.Overall there are some excellent passages in the book, but it didn't live up to my expectations."
4,Arkady Renko is a Born Investigator,"Arkady Renko is introduced in this book as a Moscow investigator. There is a bizarre triple murder in Moscow. Three bodies are found, frozen, with their faces and fingers gone. Renko is the chief homicide investigator. He's brilliant, indefatigible, honest and, as cops everywhere are, cynical. He is heading through dangerous territory in his investigation, confronting the KGB, FBI and other authorities to find the truth."
4,Works well on several levels,"This very engrossing book is both an interesting detective story and an interesting insight into Soviet life in Moscow at a certain time in the near past. By setting what would otherwise be a traditional murder mystery (with some traditionally current grotesque elements) in Moscow, Martin Cruz Smith is able to introduce a host of fresh elements into a tired genre. The Russian hero has a whole different set of personal and professional concerns than would his New York counterpart, and the characters and situations encountered are likewise different, strange and interesting because new to this type of fiction. Finally, the basic plot - the nature of the murder and the crime's solving - are totally dependent on the Moscow setting.Great stuff. A real original and highly recommended for anyone wanting something different from the same old stuff."
5,A delightful detective novel with a dash of Cold War chill,"I've always been a great fan of detective, spy and Cold War novels. This book brings out the best of all 3 worlds, but unlike so many American Cold War novels, Smith looks at the three dead bodies in Gorky Park and beyond (and out of Moscow to New York City) through the eyes of the main character--detective Arkardy Renko, a cynical Ukrainian who works hard at his job with honesty and with conviction in Moscow--and not some unkillable CIA hero. The story is filled with intrigue, cunning plot twists and wonderfully-crafted characters."
3,Worth getting through it - I think,"Mine was a hard cover book. After reading about 1/3 of the book, I almost gave up. However, after completing the book, I must admit that it was very interesting and different from anything I have ever read. My husband has read the long, long Russian novels so he encouraged me to persevere.The plot was a wonderful mystery with great character development. I found myself reading very slowly. Often, I read sentences over again. Sometimes, I never understood what was going on but isn't that the way the world really is for most of us?For me, time will tell as to whether or not it was 'worth getting through it,"" as I may read another novel by this author. If I do, I'll be interested to find out what I think then."
5,Quite simply,"This is, quite simply, the greatest novel of the last century. Not only is this a work of literary genius, the recorded reading by Henry Strozier is exceedingly well done.Buy this, read it, read it once a year till you die.Jon"
5,A genre classic!,"Near the end of Chapter 11, Renko experiences a sharp pang of discomfort as the girl he has entangled in his investigation of three murders puts a cigarette out against the bark of a birch tree, ""as if the warm stab were being pressed into his heart. He believed her. The truth had gone from her into the tree and into him."" This is the quality of writing that we get from Martin Cruz Smith. His facility with language balances with his storycraft to produce a compelling, dramatic espionage thriller that stands against the best work of Le Carre or Fredrick Forsyth."
5,My favorite poet,"I'm not sure what the other reader was reading, but I think he missed the point.Ray Bradbury is one of the best poets I have ever read"
1,"Third strike, she's out","Having loved this series, the last two books (Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins) were utter disappointments. So I picked up Incubus to give Anita one last shot. this was the worst of the bunch.I will say that despite the 600+ pages, it is quite a fast read because one can just skip between the repetitive and monotonous ""audeur inspired"" sex scenes for the few pages that actually had something to do with the plot.This series started out as something I couldn't put down. Now it's just something to avoid."
1,Agreed,"Too much sex, not enough action.I'm an avid fan and highly disappointed where the series is going.I hope it gets back on track or I can find another series to peak my interest."
1,This is so annoying!,"This series has just gone to complete shambles, and I am so disappointed. There is absolutely NO POINT to this story. The series has gotten so convoluted and meaningless. The Anita in this book is a weak parody of her former self. All you get is five thousand versions of the same sex scene. You would think Laurell Hamilton would have some qualms about abandoning her fans, but I guess she doesn't. Forget this book and the rest of this stupid series and go read Kim Harrison or Charlaine Harris!"
1,Winces and cringes,"Laurell K. has jumped the shark. I can't say too much about the last half of the book, because I gave up and just started skimmimg it. Thank god I didn't spend money on it. It's too bad, this series used to rock, now I just want to attack it with a red pen like a third-grade english teacher."
1,Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get worse,"...it does. After the last few books, I stopped buying them. I checked Incubus Dreams out from the library. I haven't even finished it and I'm ready to take it back. This book has even more sex and even less plot. Who knew that could be possible? This series used to be my favorite. The last few books I had to force myself to finish. This book I can't even force myself to finish. Please, kill Anita off already. Never thought I'd say that. But, this series has become a joke."
2,Sometimes LESS is MORE,"I am a big fan of Laurell K. Hamilton. Her latest book will not change this fact either.If you've read any of the other posts here you will see a adamant love or hate for the all the sex and ardeur scenes in Hamilton's newest novel.What I loved about Hamilton as an author was her spicy, quick witted humor and the life she breathed into the tough as nails, kick your ass right now if she has to character, Anita Blake.The plot is weak and so is Anita. One sex scene turns into another and another and I found myself wondering when a plot would start to emerge.You won't find anything like Obsidian Butterfly or Bloody Bones here--two of my favorites.I look forward to her next book--where maybe she'll resume the occupation of respected author and use less sex/porn to bring back the Anita Blake we all know and LOVE."
1,Worst in the series,"i got very wrapped up in the Anita Blake series. i couldn't get enough of it. But things started to go south (literally) in the later books and finally, it fell off my chart with this latest book. i think Miss Hamilton is having trouble keeping her stories separted. if you want smut and erotica, stick to her fairy books. Anita Blake has gone off the Deep End and i weep."
1,Incubus Dreams,"If you are a longtime fan of this series, you will simply not recognize the Anita Blake of Incubus Dreams as the same Anita Blake of Guilty Pleasures. Of course there must be room for character growth. In fact, it is a must for any long-running series. But that growth must be believable. In Incubus Dreams, Ms. Hamilton asks the reader to believe that a woman who once could not kiss a man without an emotional committment can participate in group sex that would be the envy of Jenna Jamison without a second thought. Anita's transformation is the most dramatic since Mary Magdalene's and is just as realistic. Incubus Dreams is simply a pathetic attempt to prolong the series in an effort to maximize profits to the publisher and the author."
1,Anita does everyone,I've read the series from start to finish and now I can safely say I'm finished with it. I like erotica as much as the next guy but this is really bad porn no story. I wound up skipping through most of the book I felt really embarassed for Anita degrading herself with all those really cheesy guys. If I were 13 again then it might of gotten 4 stars
1,Terrible,"Yeah...this is just terrible...I really enjoyed this series...but the last 3 books, the one in particular...they're terrible. If your thinking about buying...at least wait for the paperback, or better yet, got to the library, or borrow it...it's not worth the paper it's printed on...."
3,can we move on now?,"In this book, Jason tells Anita that the ardeur she has viewed as such a curse has allowed her to accept Nathaniel, Asher, and Micah in her life. Good. Great. I like Nathaniel and Asher. But now that that's all over with can we get rid of the ardeur? Please? Pretty please? On a a lighter note I enjoyed the last 200 pages (ie the plot) very much."
2,What happend to this series?,"Ugh. Well I finished this book because I really hate to abandon one but this one sure made it tough. It essentially was 30 pages or so of plot and another 700 of sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for some sex but 700 pages gets to be a bit much. And can there be a character introduced that Anita doesn't end up with some metaphysical connection with? Her characters are so magically incestuous. And now sexually intertwined and only one, Richard, shows any sort of jealousy over it? Yeah, that sounds likely. I know LKH said in her blog she doesn't read reviews, but I'm thinking it might be to her benefit to start doing so."
1,One More Nail in the Coffin,"All the die hard Anita fans know that her demise was after Cerulean Sins, so enough said on that. What makes this book incredibly bad is...that it is plain just not well written. There is no proofreading, and after a bit, a very little bit, the mistakes just keep nagging you and nagging you to the point where you look for them instead of paying attention to what there is of the story. The question here would be: how did the book get published with so many mistakes (grammar etc)? A greater mystery and perhaps more worth solving than the purported mystery in the story itself. Anyway if you want to insist and try to read this do it as a seven day mass event to honor the worthwhile, delicious first books in the series, and weep your heart out at what Ms Hamilton has turned our Anita into. There you go, I think I discovered a social use for this book, it is the perfect PMS read, so it deserves 1 star after all!"
1,Major disappointment in this series,"I was hooked from the first line of ""Guilty Pleasures."" Here was a strong, kick-[...] heroine in a fabulous alternate reality where magic and weird creatures really do exist. Anita solves thrilling mysteries while carrying on a sexy love life. Although I hate Richard, the other characters were interesting. The last book left me waiting breathlessly for the epic confrontation with Belle Mere and the Mother of All Vampires.....and instead we get sex, sex, sex and more sex that isn't even interesting sex, just largely lurid and gross. Anita has regressed into a hand-wringing nympho. The murder mystery had great potential that was never explored and seems to be merely something for Anita to do when she's not getting laid! Ms. Hamilton, what were you thinking about???? The book is badly written, badly edited, and a waste of good wood pulp and your money. Let's hope the next one gets it right."
1,I think I purchased a draft copy,"i was introduce to the series by a friend and immediately proceeded to obtain every issue. i purchased incubus dreams as soon as it was available from my local book merchant. after reading it, i loaned it to the owner of the book store who also happens to be a fan and asked her opinion. she returned my money and said that obiviously a mistake had been made and the publisher must have released an unedited draft. hopefully they'll release the copy that has more than 83 pages of relevant story."
2,Incubus Dreams,"I was very disappointed in this long awaited release. I got that Anita and maybe Richard have accepted much about themselves, and that Anita has to eat more often as she now carries Damian and Nathaniel in another triumvant, which has given everyone all more powers. That's it! No great plot/story line on this, or the serial killings. The major focus seemed to be chacter self improvment and feeding. I stopped collecting Anita books now! Here is hoping the Merry Gentry series dosen't go done in the same way."
2,Incubus Dreams,"I was very disappointed in this installment of the Anita Blake series, the author is getting off track. The relationships are extending adnosium but what about the great mystery part and catching the bad guys and going after the big fish (the old vampires)."
1,What happend to this series????,"I used to love this series. When this series started it was great. Action/suspense/mystery/bit of sexual tension and now it is basically all sex. I have nothing against sex. If I had wanted an erotic novel though I would have bought one. Now this was not a sudden change, this occurred over time. This book starts right off with a crime and ends with the bad guy getting there's, but the whole middle is just sex. Half way through this series there was a nice balance of sex/action and mystery. Sadly I think Mrs. Hamilton has lost her way."
1,Very Disappointed in this Book!,"I do not recommend this book to anyone!!!!!!! The series started out with so much potential, and failed miserably. If I wanted to read porn, I would buy a dime store hustler rag. A little sex is great, but this author went beyond what I would consider acceptable. The story is lost amidst writhing bodies, and no plot direction. Not to mention the typos. I will not buy nor read another book by this author. Very disappointed!"
5,Very Good,Whenever I start one of the Anita Blake books I cannot stop reading to see what happens next. This is a page turner and you don't want to miss anything.
3,bought it,i bought this book i loved it but i got to page 821 then kindle tells me end of sample ERGHHH i thought i purchased the whole book only issue i had i love laurell's work
5,yet again amazing,I have never had anything go wrong with an amazon order. This book arrived within the time frame and in great condition. This is one of the best series I have ever read!
2,Incubus Dreams,I love the book but theres about 3 chapters that has been misprinted. Half the pages are gone and it starts about half way through the page. Very unsatisfied with the quality of the book.
2,I feel better now....,"I've been so disappointed with Incubus Dreams. I thought it was just me, but after reading a few other reviews, I feel better that it's not just me. Laurell Hamilton is a great writer. But I get the feeling that after Obsidian Butterfly, the ""thriller"" part of the series vanished and we are left with little more than a book of erotic fiction with a sparse story line. I like seeing Anita's character evolve. I actually skipped two chapters last night. Two or three chapters devoted completely to a new sexual excursion may be a bit of overkill. Even the erotica of it all is getting redundant. I get it, I really do. But it's lost something. I hope Micah starts getting better because I feel committed to this series now. I want the dark humor and excitement back!"
1,awful simly awful,"I'm sorry, this novel was just horrible. I ended up skipping PAGES because it was so boring, redundant, or just dumb...I definitely would never recommend this book. The writing is bland, confusing and all over the place. The characters seem to have no personality or chemistry. All Anita thinks about it sex, sex, sex. An all around waste of time."
3,Not as good as the previous books...,"I don't mind sex scenes...even if some are graphic (the first time Anita and JC are together is HOT). However, this book was just a string of graphic sex scenes, one right after another. I love the characters in this series of books. I hope the author returns to her earlier plot and character driven writing style and stops relying on graphic sex to sell."
5,Satisfactory read,"I have just finished reading the book the second time and I read it at a more leisure pace this time. This is a book that left me with a satisfactory feeling - so many times books go too fast over issues and don't develop them enough. The author is awesome in her courage in taking her protagonist in directions that are not always seen as ""normal"". There is lot of sex in this book, but most of it is justified and shows the changes Anita goes through, her acceptance of the people around her and herself. This book has developed far from being a simple mystery series, it has so much more. I don't read the book longer just for the mystery, but to meet the people again that are part of the world. Hamilton has managed to create people that feel real and interesting, and that I like to meet again."
2,What happened to the story?,"I love the Anita Blake series. But this book doesn't seem like one of them. Where's the action? Where's the crime? Where's the STORY? After reading 300+ pages I realized I was still in the first 24 hours of the story and in those 24 hours Anita had doing nothing more than have sex (real and metaphysical) with just about any male who has ever entered the story line and a few who haven't. If I wanted erotica, I would have bought erotica.Such a disappointment when a great series of books goes sour."
4,HOT!!! H.....O......T!,"I can't understand why fans are bashing this book, too much sex and not enough crime for some people I guess, I thought it was definitely different from the other crime books of Anita Blake but it was fun just to have the ""Sex"", ""relationship issues"" and less crime for a change. Can't wait for more!(no pun intended:))"
4,"Oh, to wait another year . . .","I admit. I was a little disappointed, but only at first. Yeah, there was definitely more sex than plot in this book (not that I'm complaining or anything . . . :)), but it wasn't until near the end that I'm pretty sure I realized what Ms. Hamilton was doing. This book seems to be setting up for the next one. Anita was doing all these things, crossing all these lines and everything, and it seemed to me that it was all to set up for the next book. I could be wrong--maybe it's just what I'd like to think, but if I'm right, can you imagine the next one? I simply can't wait. So, my initial disappointment aside, that's why I've rated this they way I have. It was awesome in what it was--and what I'm sure it'll become in future novels. :)"
4,Gathering up loose ends at last,"This book finally brings together a lot of loose ends that needed to be wrapped up. The book is long and emotional, but considering the number of relationships involved in the Anita Blake Universe, it was time to wrap up and move forward on some longrunning story lines. Can't wait to see where LKH goes from here! If you are an LKH fan, keep reading, I couldn't put the book down!"
2,"Anita Loses Her ""Cool""!","In the latest of the Anita Blake series, ""Incubus Dreams"" hits an unfortunate sour note. There is a crime, introduced early, to wet our appetites and tease us with anticipation. However, the anticipation all but disappears while we wade through 600 odd pages of Anita's angst over her sex life and with whom she should or shouldn't feel guilty. Frankly, this is a perfect example of how too much of anything leads to a deadening of interest. By the time we return to the crime, I'm all but ready to let them get away with it just for having to wait around while Anita gets her sexual/magical jollies.Please, let's get back to strengthening the necromancy and fighting crime. Jean-Claude, Richard, and everyone and their brother will just have to wait for Anita to take care of business."
1,A sad entry in what was once an entertaining series.,Anita Blake used to be interesting. Now she's just a superhuman sex-machine that's laden with Catholic guilt and typoes. At one point I accidently skipped ahead 50 pages and didn't even notice. Nevertheless I will probably still read anything else that LKH comes out with because I'm a completist like that.
1,Major Disappointment,"Short and sweet....I was so disappointed, and I'm glad to see other reviewers agree with me. There was about 20% story mixed in with 80% porn. And that's if you could find the story among the typo's and occasional grammatical errors. I've bought every book by this author and have noticed an unfortunate turn in the type of story that is being produced. I am drawn to the strong female character, the romance, and the action, all of which were lacking in this story. I would not recommend buying this book."
1,I didn't know sex could be this boring!,"I agree with most of the reviewers of this book. I found myself skipping through all of the sex scenes desperately looking for some plot. I was very disappointed in this book, being a huge Anita fan."
1,What the heck happened?,I usually like the Anita Blake series but what the heck is up with all the porn? I'm freaking 200 pages into it and the murder has not even been touched upon. But AB can have a female ej. Yaaaay! WTF. What the heck happened to this series...it's become a total waste of time.
2,What happened to Anita?,"LKH took a really cool, independent, take charge type of woman and turned her in to some sort of porn star. I have no problem with sex, but the relentless, often distasteful, gratuitous sex in this book is off putting. I'd like to get back to the ""story"" and less of the twisted sexual proclivities of of a wannabe porn star."
2,Not Enough Plot,"I have purchased every Laurell K. Hamilton novel that has come out, and this is probably the worst. I love the Anita Blake character, but the author is spending more time talking about kinky sex than the plot of the story. Lets go back to a plot like Guilty Pleasures, the Laughing Corpse, etc where there is a little sex in between the action instead of a little action in between the sex scenes."
3,I miss the old Anita,"I love the Anita Blake novels, and part of me feels guilty for giving this novel a bad review. I miss the old Anita though. I am so tired of reading about her having sex. I want to read about the monsters and I want the mystery. What happened to Hamilton? This novel is still a fast page turner and still enjoyable, but it is not up to par with the beginning of the series. I hope there is a vast turnaround in the next Anita novel or I am going to have to stop reading."
1,Please LKH!,"If you can't rejuvenate Anita back to her former glory, be merciful and just kill her off!!"
1,Not worth your time!,"After hearing rave reviews about this author I decided to listen to the (libraries copy) audio version while driving to and from work. You'd think for being a 30 hour disc set it could at least be a little entertaining. Too much unnecessary details in my opinion, cussing, and overall horrid violent sex described in the first disc alone. Oh, and there is a murder mystery tucked in there somewhere. Details about rape, rough sex, a lot of ""F"" words and other descriptions of a sexual nature discouraged me from moving on to disc two. I might look into her earlier books since so many expressed how bad the new ones have become. Don't waste your time with this one!"
1,Channeling Philip Roth...a lousy imitation!,"I am just so disgusted by this book..I had to force myself to finish it just to see how much damage Hamilton could do to her characters. What a disappointment...the incessant sex scenes stuck between the few instances of police work, are just overwhelmingly bad! None of this reads like it was written by the author who penned the earlier books in the series. She writes like she is trying to please some absurd 'male' fantasy version of what women ""really"" want...I don't believe I will buy the next book. Perhaps Ms. Hamilton won't miss my lousy eight bucks,..but I won't ever regain the time I put into reading this trash."
2,How disappointing! How sad!,"I have to echo other reviews. I'm a big fan of the series, but have to say I'm struggling to get through this one. I love sex scenes as much as anyone, but this is ridiculous...the plot is a total afterthought! I hope there's some way that this feedback is getting back to Hamilton"
1,Let me get this straight.........,"Anita is an expert of deep throating, has wild, tumultuous sex several times in one day with several men, is a rainmaker *and* multi-orgasmic without the need of female-centered foreplay? Sounds like every man's pornographic dream come true to me! And that is just the problem. LKH wants to make Anita Blake sound like a such an amazing woman that she has lost track of what this series is supposed to be about. Ms. Hamilton, if you have issues about creating some sort of superwoman in the Nietzsche fashion, go seek therapy, but please bring back the no-nonsense, gun-happy, self-assured heroine that we once knew and loved."
1,Could have been better,I have been awaiting the arrival of this book for some time.. I am a huge fan of laurell's Anita Blake series... I was extremly dissapointed with this book.... there were TONS of errors... I mean.. time to get a new type editor perhaps? She repated herself over and over in this book... yes we already know who Belle Morte' is thank you... this book was open for sooooo many things.. and all she put in it was a TON about the arduer... sex is interesting.. but come on now... we want more vampires and more were-animals... not more sex.. all in alll this book was a huge let down... hopefully her next one will make up for 685 pages of sex...
1,No longer an Anita Blake Fan,I would really like to know what happened? I was a dedicated Anita Blake fan. WAS being the operative word. Previously LKH books had plot to them. This book is 98% sex with practically everyone walking dead or alive. 2% plot! I felt really cheated that I blew good money on the hardcover (that's never happening again). I could have gotten the 98% from a cheap penthouse paperback. Instead of expecting a fun book and a good read I was bitterly disappointed. Save your money. LKH should go back to formula!
2,In mourning....,"I have about twenty pages to go in this book and I don't care if I finish it or not. I miss the flavor of the first books in the series...fun and a bit dangerous. Now it's just skimming till you get to a half-way decent part. I'm sick of vampire politics and pard rules. I'm hoping in the next book Edward comes back and does them all in!Incubus Dreams I have to admit is one star better than CS. I should check this review for typos, but since nobody checked Incunbus Dreams...why should I?Reader Beware!"
2,What happened?,"This series has gone downhill since Obsidian Butterfly.All Anita does in this book is have sex, with everyone and anyone. It's disgusting."
3,It's all down hill from here,"This is the last book I bought from Laurell K Hamilton. After this I just ordered it via my local library, I persevered because of those early books but after book 15 I gave up because it certainly felt like LKH had and now she was only writing pulp to satisfy the masses who couldn't seem to stop reading in the hope that she would write a book like those early ones.The last great book in the Anita Blake series was book 9: Obsidian Butterfly, so I recommend books 1-9 from the Anita Blake world, after that you just want to demand your money back.Don't ever buy a Merry Gentry book - waste of time, you will never get those hours or $$ back.As for the book I think Anita had sex with someone, felt bad, had more sex, got a new power that meant she had to have more sex... oh and then had sex again before killing some vampires and making macho human men respect her because she had bigger balls than them... and then more sex."
1,Downhill Slide,"Really enjoyed the first 9 books. Will stop after Incubus Dreams. I enjoy reading and sex but when it takes the place of story line, you loose me. Sorry."
3,I would have REALLY liked this one if...,"Anita (Laurell) could just get sex off of her mind. I mean if she wasn't doing it in some strange way, she was thinking about doing it some strange way. C'mon...I doubt even a Harlequin has that much sex! (And I do NOT know from personal experience!)I don't know about anybody else-I haven't read any other reviews yet-but I just not voyeur enough to appreciate the novel. And c'mon.. she can't manage to get a change of clothes somewhere? I know it's an imaginary world, but couldn't she call home and have somebody take her some clothes? Ugghhh..The non-sex scenes were pretty good...if you can get to all twenty pages or so of them, you'll like this book."
1,"All sex, no plot. A waste of money...","Sadly, Hamilton's books continue to go downhill, and this one is no exception. Too much talky sex, with a bit of plot thrown in as an after-thought. Hamilton used to research her books by studying police procedure, firearms handling, and mysticism. Now she ""studies"" a manual of sexual positions (really, she said so herself!). On her fan site, Hamilton reported that she was ""studying"" such a manual looking for a position she hadn't used in a book yet, although she bragged that she and her new husband already knew most of them. Well, whoo-hoo for her. Anita Blake has degenerated from a tough yet likeable character into a vehicle for Hamilton's lame sexual fantasies, and the mystery/suspense/horror that made the books so engaging has gone out the window. Save your money. If you want a good read, go pick up the old books from a second-hand store."
1,Worst book ever,"I was a huge fan of Laurell Hamilton, But this book is garbage!! It makes no sense & lacks everything that made the first 8 books great.The writing sloppy & incoherent for a good chunk of the timeAnita Blake needs to get back to her day job & quit being a slash whore. I for one will stop reading these books that I had loved so well & will encourage the same people I got to read these books to not buy another book of hers. Just terrible. I am trying to not be mean, but I am really disappointed in the way Laurell Hamilton has let taken these once amazing books. Please do not read Incubus Dreams, you will just hate yourself later."
2,WOW (in a bad way),"First off, this is the lowest review score I have ever given I dont usually do bad reviews...I dont know where to start but to say others arnt exagerrating this book is not up to the standards of the others. I will admit I wanted there to be more sex, more bedroom type fun ;) I had no idea that when it came everything else would suffer a GREAT deal! She screwed everyone and please no more its ""tight...he's so big"" please ANITA stopped being tight a while back lol and lucky her all her men are sooo biggg. So is it worth reading, yeah its barely ok, I would try to get it from a library im selling my entires series...I will continue to read it probably im very forgiving but its just not the same she has a Harem of supposably ALPHA males who are complete chumps,sex toys, and weak....WOW...and WOW what the heck is up with Anita the only way I was able to finish it was to Skim."
2,Super Reader,"If she wants to write what someone on a forum I saw somewhere called Fangfrackers, that is fine.Don't dress them up as monster hunting books though, and call aspade a spade, and throw in the erotica word. Will that hurt sales thatbadly? If she put out a line of books purely focused on women shagging monsters, can't imagine she wouldn't do really well with it, as she seems to have some talent in that area.The plot here is of the thin crust variety, no doubt about it.Personally, in a ghost busting or monster hunting book, I want somestuff to happen."
3,fan-but slightly dissappointed,"the anita blake series is a fantastic series. i couldn't wait for incubus dreams to come out, however, after having read it now,i was dissappointed for the first time by Hamilton. the book was more sex than story telling. i love the drama in anita's life and this time sex prevailed. I am looking forward with great enthusiasum for danse macabre. over all, the series is a five star series, with just that one slip. i recommended it to all my friends, and i recommend it to all of you!!!!"
4,Depends on what you like,"The truth is, this book really wasn't on par with the preceeding books of the series plot wise, but in truth, this book is the true turning of Anita's morals. Before she was wondering if she was just one of the monsters and in this book, she begins to accept it, as well as accepting that some of her infamous rules are pointless. It is fascinating to see just how exactly someone's mind can go from so high on the moral podium to having nearly no lines anymore and this book accuratly shows the mental process of that degration.This book also back tracked a little by pointing out that vampires, while looking like humans and thinking like humans most of the time, are NOT, in fact, human.Sure there's lots and lots of sex (depends, really, on whether you like that kind of thing or not) but most of that really just helps show how Anita is beginning to accept herself and those around her as well as the situation in life she had been thrown."
4,wordy but still good,"This book seems to be more of the same about Anita Blake. That being said, it was fairly good and interesting. It seemed a little wordy at times."
4,"my, my anita........","has gotten quite sexy lately haven't ya? man oh man this is one good novel with lots of SEX but anita coming to terms with the ardeur and the many men in her life was also compelling........ but i do miss the old badass anita......... wouldn't mind having her back, but keep the hot sex.........."
3,Getting bored.,"This book was a LITTLE more interesting than all of the other's but they pretty much all have the same story line. She's with a vampire (or is it 2 or 3), and anything else that hits her fancy. She kills the bad guys. The only thing that saves this book is that the Hamilton had A LOT more pages to build up to the few sexual content scenes and this one has only one more than the rest of the books. The first HALF of the series she's trying to decide to sleep with and who to kill and by this book she's ""sleeping"" with just about anything that moves and killing it, too. I hope that this series doesn't have to many more books left. Eventhough, I'll have to read them just to see if she ends up with any certain being...I like Hamilton's other series the ""Meredith Gentry"" series a lot better. If your looking for a series to read, read that one instead."
5,LOVED IT!!!,this book was awesome!!! i love the different plot lines and all the characters that are introduced!! WOO HOOOOOOOOO!!!!I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK!!
5,"Great Book, Great series","This is like some of the recent LKH books--a real page-turner. I have enjoyed this book and as before, it is hard to put down."
4,Still love LKH!,"Just read the book and while I love Laurell Hamilton and her Anita Blake series, This one was a bit disappointing. Not enough crime plot and just a little bit too much sex. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely loves both scenes with Anita and Nathieal and Anita/Nathieal/Jason and the one with Anita and both her trimuvalents. But the bar scene wasn't really needed in my opinion. Still definitely love the author and the series. While this wasn't one of her best, I have read much much much worse books, none of them by Mrs. Hamilton. I get the feeling anita is going through a crisis of spirit and I definitely think one book will not work to handle the whole sceme of what she is going through. I hope Mrs. Hamilton keeps writing Anita Blake books. I plan on telling my grandchildren about them and her wonderful works."
5,Change is not always a bad thing,"This book is a continued evolution of the series and being that it is one in a long series, not all of the answers are going to be revealed if the series is to continue. In every book, she changes and develops more, more power, more personlity, different opinions, and evolving relationships. You have to keep reading the books to find out all the secrets, and when something is fully explained finally, another new change arrives. But that's just how an author has to write to keep a long series going. I for one am still interested in the world of Anita and can't wait for Danse Macabre and the new Meredith Gentry book. She can't write them fast enough for me."
5,The series keeps getting better,"I'm not sure if the people reading this book have read the entire series or not. Anita has developed from a black and white no compromise person where there is only good or bad and no middle ground, into a real person that can see the grey areas and appreciate the fact that there is no absolute good or evil.This book gives more depth to all the characters and lets you know what is going on inside them and why they are doing what they do. I can hardly wait for ""Micah"" and ""Danse Macabre"" to see even more of what drives the characters.If you're looking for your typical vanilla vampires, were's, and other assorted monsters---human and otherwise, read something else. Anita Blake and company are hot and getting hotter."
1,What has happened?,"First and foremost, I have loved the Anita Blake Series. However, Incubus Dreams has almost completely turned me off. It is very hard to like a character that requires and demands all the attention but complains the whole time. She has gotten very ""all about her."" I didn't mind the sex, but c'mon 5 people in less than 24 hrs? Am I the only one who is bored by the various ties and metaphyical explanations that I skip it now? I want the cases and vampire hunter back. Was there even a case in this one? I was so irritated, i can't remember. Why have all the characters become unlikable? Where is Edward? I want the old Anita back!"
2,"Too much sex, not enough monsters","Just wanted to add some ""me too's"" to the review list. Not that I don't like well written sex scenes, but after the overdose in ""Cerulean Dreams"" I decided not to buy this book but got on the hold list at the local library. Glad I did. Instead of all the sex I would have rather read about Dolph's daughter-in-law-to-be and family dynamics, a fight with Moroven (Damien's maker-at least in this book), Barbara & Steve Brown's murdered son who Barbara is going to have animated come hell or high water, Stephen & Gregory's abusive father confronting his now-were boys, the vampire church's problems with no blood oaths, the problems Micah sorts out with the coalition or springing somebody (or everybody) from a lycanthrope safe house. And, of course, more interesting monsters, human and non-human. I hope LKH is not going to dole out these kind of story lines in miserly doses among pages and pages and pages of sex."
2,Very Convoluted - Very Disappointing,"After reading every book in every series LKH has written, I was looking forward to this. After reading happily along for the first 15 pages, the book then slid into a disappointing miasma of side plot lines and (never thought I'd say this), way too much strange sex. I don't think the ""mystery"" aspect of solving the serial killings even picked up until perhaps 3-400 pages later. I actually started skimming over the sex scenes, as they became rather rote and boring, to see if the story would pick up again. It did at the end of the book, but about 200 pages of superflous couplings could have been edited out. Am hoping LKH reads some of her fan's reviews, and fixes this in the next book."
1,SOoooo disappointing,"I like so many here have been a die hard fan since Guilty Pleasures and have ""stuck"" with it through all the new books despite their declining quality. This book is just another in the past 3-4 where her once great plots get lost in pages upon pages of repetitive porn. Even the vocabulary she uses to describe these ""erotica"" scenes is recycled. She has reduced once complex male figures into 2-dimensional (or less) adoring sex slaves or sulky child figures.Her main character Anita Blake has gone from a commanding/feisty ""do it herself"" woman to an over-sexed drama queen. Hamilton really seems to be dragging Anita down in more than plot, but in character depth as well. Realllly disappointing.I don't think I will anymore of her novels since they are now more inept erotica rather than fun detective fiction. When in an almost 700 page book only about 100-150 pages actually involve a recognizable plot you know you have entered the erotica/romance zone."
1,"More story, less sex please",The actual story takes up about 5 pages of this book. The rest is Anita having sex with everyone who happens to come along. Time to move this series to the porn category and forget that there is supposed to be a story that goes along with it.
1,It is not what I expected,"I love LKH's Anita Blake Series but this one dissapointed me. In this book Anita instead of find out who or what commited the crime/murder and why? She focus more into who she will do and how? There is a lot of pages for a story which span is like 2 to 4 days and also how she wrap it all up on the last chapters is dissapointing. I think there is a lot of pages wasted on the sex issues, it is not that Im squeamish about the sex stuff is because for me, sometimes less is more."
2,Careful what you wish for,"I had fantasies about doing it with Anita Blake, I read the Guilty Pleasures to Obsidian Butterfly novels and they were truly one of the best series of books I had ever read. And I love eros as much as the next person, when I got Incubus Dreams a 30 disk cd set, by disk 16 there were three descriptions of the Anita Blake I grew to love, the rest of it was Anita as sex object, I undertand the integral part her powers have in the novels, however I got it the first time, I didn't need to hear it over and over and over and over....get the drift???? When I want sexy, I get sexy, same for adult themes, I wanted Anita Blake Vampire Hunter, what I got was Anita Blake S**T, which if made into an adult movie and advertised as such I would purchase, Laurel Hamilton is still an excellent author, just package the novels honestly, and beleive me I am no prude."
3,Too Much Sex?,"The earlier Anita Blake books always had a lot of sex, but also a plot. The last two, Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams, have almost no plot. I never thought you could have too much sex, but that is all that Anita does now. There is a vampire serial cult killing strippers in this book, but that seems more an incidental happening rather than the purpose of the book. Sex is great, but I enjoyed the earlier plots much more. I probably won't buy her future books, just borrow them from the library."
3,Not Hamilton's Best,"I fell in love with the Anita Blake series after reading Guilty Pleasures, but was disappointed in this latest addition to the series. It is still a good book, but it got too wordy and some scenes just would not end. I prefer the books were the action was fast paced and the personal touches about the characters blended with the stories. This one felt like the action/mystery was just thrown in as an after thought to all of the emotional issues that the main characters were dealing with. I still recommend this series, but I hope that the next installment will be more in the style of the earlier books."
1,"Ridiculous, pathetic, and not even slightly exciting","The Anita Blake series was recommended to me, and I've been plowing through the increasingly awful books. Blue Moon was OK, the rest are repetitive and overdependent on descriptions of her guns, knives, eye color, hair length, and clothing. But this one is the limit, a wannabe porn joke. I keep trying to figure out WHAT the author was thinking. Did she think this would be funny, watching the character add more and more partners, in sillier and sillier sex scenes? It really is just pathetic; The Executioner, a slave to her powers and her libido, screwing anything and everyone that moves, in any way possible, because if she doesn't her minions will die. Oh puhleaze. Not funny, not sexy, not thrilling, not interesting, not worth checking out of the library, much less paying actual money for this book. Amazing that so much sex could be so very very boring."
1,Trash,"The once brave and smart-witted main character, Anita, has turned her back on us who loved her for her strong minded and sassy attitude...to lie ON her back. Yes, she has turned into a whore.The amount of sex that the author has incorporated into her story for no apparent reason than to fill up pages has turned this book into a lousy, boring piece of crap best left near the crapper. Supposedly, the author promised resolutions to the on-going conflicts between Anita and her lovers. She resolved them alright...with sex.Someone call Buffy to slay this vampire humper.r"
1,And the bad keep getting worse,"This is the 12th book in the Anita Blake series, or at least it is by title... I like to refer to this book as the third release in Laurell K Hamilton's new erotic series.The last good Anita Blake book was Obsidian Butterfly. That book was the embodiment of what the series used to be.Don't buy Incubus Dreams. It is a waste of money. It is about 100 pages or less of actually story and the rest is either badly written sex or angsting over the badly written sex.Save yourself the misery and buy something else. The money spent on this book would be better spent on something actually worth it."
1,Boring Instruction Guide to Porn,"I can honestly say it is now over with this writer for both series. This series started out with some interesting characters, alternate history, and good mystery / suspense. Now I feel most of her fans could write these current books and do a better job of it. I think the last 60 pages actually focuses on what we used to love about Anita. Now the only people that could actually choke down the first 600 pages have to be into porn. And it's not even good porn! Sorry Ms. Hamilton, you'll have to put your books in a different place in the store if you keep writing this way. In fact, I don't think this book should even be in horror."
2,Lost my interest in the series,"I thought the series was great up until Narcissus in Chains. It's all downhill from there folks. Incubus Dreams is the worst of all with 300 pages of pointless sex, no plot development, or any interesting characters with the exception of Nathaniel. I was reading a book a week until this one came out. I started it in December. After reading the threeway between Anita, Richard, and Jean-Claude, I put the book down and haven't picked it up since. Three months later it's still sitting unfinished on my nightstand serving a better purpose as a coaster. Way to kill a great series Laurell."
2,Please do away with the ardeur!!,"I have read Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake books all the way from the beginning, but I simply could NOT finish this book. I tried twice, and finally gave up. I mean, the main character goes from being at times overly prudish to becoming a complete slut. The so-called ardeur takes over the entire plot until you forget what the plot actually is! It all just becomes another reason for Anita to have gratuitous sex with...whoever! Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the hot scenes in the books, but come on! And on a side note...the bestiality was a little much. Needless to say, I will be skipping this disaster and moving on to the next book, IF I decide to keep reading LKH at all!"
2,Slightly better than Cerulean Sins,"If you're an Anita Blake fan, you'll probably read this book, if only to find out what happens in this series. I have to agree with the other reviews. There is less and less plot, and more and more sex. It seems to be an alarming trend since the incredible writing of Obisdian Butterfly. This book is slightly better than Cerulean Sins, but not much. Its definitely longer, but once again, more sex scenes, longer book.The only nice thing about this book, is seeing Richard become less of a pansy and Nathaniel becoming more 'real'. I would like to see more of what causes that development in Richard, but doubt we will see any reflection in the future. The main thing I hope is whoever is editing the series keeps Laurell on track, so we don't see Richard bouncing back and forth between being a pansy and coming to terms with himself."
3,"We Need More Heroics, Less Sex","Hamilton is turning into Christine Feehan. Stop, please stop! Sex scene after sex scene is just boring. Where did Anita the hero/anti-hero go? We the loyal readers loved Anita because against all odds she kicked-ass, human and otherwise.Let's get back to the hanging (non-sex) plot lines and reintroduce some real mystery, intrigue, horror, battles, and heroics. I am all in favor of a sexy heroine; but Hamilton is book by recent book taking the heroine out of the equation. The arduer as plot device to break down sexual barriers has run its course. Let Anita master it and move beyond it. Put her and her friends in mortal danger (I suggest even killling off one or more major characters to create heightened drama) and let's see how she uses all of these new powers."
1,horrible,If I wanted to read erotica then I would. All the later books in the series just slid down a very steep slope into a large pile of manure. I wouldn't recommend any book in the series past book 8.
2,Last one for me...,"I really enjoyed the first 10 books of this series. They got a little too gory for me at times, went a little overboard in the shock value from time to time, but I still enjoyed the characters and the story behind it all. I keep trying, thinking she'll get back on track, but this book officially ends my interest in Anita Blake. I don't mind some sex scenes here and there if they expand the plot and continue the story. The past few books have increased from being good stories to being hard core porn. Nothing is left to the imagination, every little detail is included and they are not subtle. I find myself skimming over half the book because all the sex just doesn't matter. Anita finds herself ""needing"" to bonk every male she comes in contact with because of this convenient beast she has in her now. She's not even her anymore. LKH should've just started a whole new series with a new character to carry this Ardeur BS and have sex every five minutes. I'm bored and I'm done."
1,no plot,"I agree with the other reviewers about this book - sex, sex, sex. I enjoy a little sex in novels as well as the next person but to give up the story line - NO! I have been a fan of the Anita Blake series from the beginning and am sorry to see the down turn in the novels. Maybe she should return to the land of Nightseer for awhile. I hope the writing improves regarding plot, as for steaminess she already excels in that area."
1,Frustration of the worst sort,"I won't repeat the detailed reports of other reviewers, but I can not hold back my frustration. LKH used to be one of my favorite authors. But the the number of continuity errors, spelling errors and just bad writing/editing have reached a point where they are infuriating. The repetative pet phrases and the complete lack of pacing are amateurish. The way the 'plot' is put on hold for the majority of the book for the sex scenes (or more to the point, the ad nauseum talking about the sex) is simply self-indulgent.If what you really love about the Anita Blake books is the endless romantic analysis, the beautiful men and their slavish devotion to Anita, and the hot, erotic sex scenes, you're obviously the audience for whom LKH is writing now, and you may like this book, because there is plenty of that. If you're looking for the mystery/intrigue/adventure that characterized LKH's earlier work, you will only be frustrated here."
2,We will let this one slide!,"OK... granted this book meandered from plot to subplot to sidebar and sometimes back again, and yes it read more like a ""Letter to Penthouse"" than your typical LKH novel... but let's just chalk it up to... well I don't know what you can chalk it up to. Anyway, I will reserve judgment until the next installment to see where things go. After all, any ""Anita"" book can't be all bad and this one still has plenty of supernatural ruffhousing and metaphysical fun!"
4,Too long but competent,"Strange direction to the series this book takes. I understand how some might be put off by it. A lot of the criticisms levied here are accurate. However, I still was drawn into the book by the story and the character development. I can't wait until the next couple of books come out in 2006."
5,It left me breathless,I loved this book. I have been a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton and the Anita Blake series for 10 years now and she has NEVER disappointed me. INCUBUS DREAMS is wonderfully written and explores the relationships Anita finds herself in and her attempts to renew her friendships as well as trying to pull her personal relationships together. I am so in love with Jean Claude and Anita that I cried when I reached the last page and then had to start the whole series over again so I could stay close to them.
3,another good read,"a good read if you are a fan . not as good as some of her earlier works but, i still could'nt put it down."
1,The last Anita Blake book i'll ever pick up,"Unfortunately I have to agree with others who gave this book a negative review.This review may contain minor plot spoilers!Like so many of them i fell face first into the Anita Blake books. I even put up with the erotic field trips. This book, however, is just full of sex and very little else. Just when i think we might be getting somewhere with zombies and animating it turns into another sex fest. And it took until page 240 something to even mention anything other than Anita's crazy sex life. In fact she was clothed just long enough to argue with a client before needing to be ""rescued from her condition"".I also agree with another reader when they said if she wants to write erotic fiction she should label it as such. It seems the days of crime solving and life and death situation is gone from Anita's life. I found myself skipping through chapters just waiting for her to put her clothes on long enough to step outside.Very sad turn of events for the series."
4,hhmmm,ok this book had a lot more sex then any other of Anita books but damn it was good! I dont know about anyone else but it's good to see Nathanial be dominant!
3,INCUBUS DREAMS,i read the whole series........this one was hard to get through she seemed to lose focus.very little of her job was in this book. Just mostly her issues with her new powers and relationship problems. it was okay you need to read it to get the next book. Which ic MICAH and that book ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
3,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but...","I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would (based on the reviews), but the problems in it outweighed much of my enjoyment. The plot wasn't interesting or substantial enough (in most of the book) to balance out the sex scenes. Or I should say the very long, overly detailed, this-is-why-I'm-having-sex justifications before actually having the sex scenes. Whew... I wanted to say, just do it and move on... the over-justifying was painful to watch. That said, Anita does finally come to terms (mostly) with her need to have more than one man in her life (finally... I can tolerate a lot from a character, but enough angst is enough already), and Richard redeems himself a little in this book. However, the repeated phrases, over-description, and over-justification just seemed to bog the book down too much. I'm still interested enough to read the next in the series, though, so it wasn't a total waste of my time."
3,"Great Characterization, but the sex nearly ruins the story","I'm a long time fan of the Anita Blake series. Hamilton can write a murder mystery in a fantasy setting better than any writer I have ever read. Most importantly, her characters are wonderfully complex and endearing.I liked the way that Incubus Dreams resolved a lot of character issues, but I was bitterly disappointed that the story had to come to a screeching halt every twenty pages for yet another increasingly raunchy sex scene. I wanted to see more characterization and more murder mysteries, not just watch the cast be arranged into a variety of sexual positions. I won't read the Meredith Gentry series because it is nothing but sex, and I am saddened to see this series following the same path. If the Anita Blake books become much raunchier, I will stop reading them."
4,Very exciting.,This was a great book. A lot happening with romance and action. Anita has to find herself and come to terms with the life she has. Very exciting and a very enjoyable read.
2,This may be the last Anita Blake book I ever read...,"There was just too much filler (Anita having sex with everyone) and not enough of the case. In fact, I realized that I had actually forgotten what the case was. I didn't even finish the book before I returned it to the library."
2,Better Luck Next Time,"Laurell Hamilton is one of about 2 authors that I will cough up the bucks for the hard back. It's been interesting to see her writing style evolve. Her first couple of Anita Blake books involved a whole new kind of story line which I liked. Her next several books involved a whole new kind of story line with a very sensual element which I really liked. Now we've come full circle. Most of the book covers sex scenes, usually kinky. A lot of what's left over involves discussion with people in her life and with herself; lots of angst here. Obviously, this leaves very little room for anything resembling an actual plot.Laurell isn't the only game in town with this kind of supernatural story line any more. I hate to say it, but some of the other authors are doing it better. Even when she's poor, Laurell Hamilton is still worth reading, but I'll probably wait for the paperback on her next effort."
2,End of the Line,"Ms. Hamilton has truly lost track of what this story was about. I thought the sex ""phase"" would pass, but it's not going to. I didn't have a problem with one, two, or even three sex scenes, but this book was nothing but sex. I used to be excited when these books came out, but I've finally realized that the characters are not going to develop any further, which is sad because Anita used to be a Kick as Bitch with a purpose...I don't think I have to say what she is now."
2,am I done yet?,I am a die-hard LKH fan and when my husband saw me bring this book home he was prepared to run the house for a few days because I usually can't put her books down. Not this one mama. It took me so long to read because it just was NOT intersting. It really doesn't add much to the series so my advice is to just skip it. Maybe her next one will be better after she reads all these harsh reviews (fingers crossed).
2,What happened??????,"I gave the book two stars just because I can't admit to myself that an Anita Blake novel could be awful.Not the book I was looking forward to. There have been many times in the past where I was tired of Ms. Blake's whinny, high moral double standards and wished she would 'go with the flow,' but this was a little too much. You can only read about someone having sex for so long... The end of the book was great. The beginning was about four hundred pages too long.To wait another year+ for the next book in the series may give most fans too much time to think about just how badly this book was written."
1,Incubus Dreams,"While I thought that nothing could be worse than Dance Macbre, Hamilton proved me wrong with this installation of the Blake series. This book has lost the luster of the early books of the series. The grand battle that usually happens at the end of the books is sadly replased with disturbing sex scenes. The intreguing growth of Anita's powers has been replaced with the growth of her lust. Serriously, Hamilton, if you want to write a romance series, write one, but don't forsake one of my favorite characters for an outlet for your sexual frustration!"
1,"I'd like a side of plot with the porn, please","The first five or six books in this series were awesome, creative, fun, plot driven -- as genre novels should be, because let's not kid ourselves, LKH doesn't write literature. The series was great because it was an awesome mix of detective novels with a fantasy background and some romance thrown in. Now it's all about the sex and not even emotional or interesting sex. I suppose LKH thinks she's making it interesting with the multiple partners and with the descriptions of what it takes to give a good bj, but that's not what makes a good sex scene -- that barely makes good porn.I don't care about Anita anymore. I don't care if she lives or dies or who she ends up with, or about her job (which she doesn't seem to much care about anymore either.)Don't bother to read this, if you want some good and honest erotica with a fantasy edge read an Ellora's Cave book."
1,It's like having your teeth drilled without anesthetic...,"I knew what I was getting into when I picked up this book. I had few illusions about LKH's talents as an author post ""Obsidian Butterfly."" I could go on and on about how BAD this book is and how it lacks any redeeming factors which make a novel worth purchasing. Others have done that job already.I think the most stinging review I can give this book is that I'm going back to the bookstore and demanding my money back. If people stop paying for feces on paper, maybe the author will finally get the point, put down her copy of Marquis de Sade's ""Ettiquite in the Bedroom"" (which at least was well written), and write a story with a plot."
3,"Technical difficulties, please stand by","Due to mechanical errors in grammar, editing, and story continuity, what should be a wonderful book is dragged into the quagmire of what the heck just happened?The author is free to take her stories in to whatever realm that she so chooses, and should.If you like lots of sex, then this is the book for you. Hamilton's sex scenes are improving, and not so mechanical unlike the first few in earlier books. But, if you like an asskicking taking no prisoner's Anita, sorry, she didn't show up in this book.I don't buy many books in hardcover, and I think the next one, I will be waiting for the paperback version.I would have given this book a better rating, but the mechanical and grammatical errors were just too overwhelming for me to ignore. And it did affect the flow of the story, at least for me."
2,It's a Stinker,"I have been a loyal reader of this series, but this will be the last book I purchase. What happened to the plot, the mystery, the character development?This book is a tedious series of sexual situations thinly glued together with rare mentions of a group of serial killers that we never meet. So what if there are a couple dead strippers-there's a sex scene to get through!What happened to the tough, smart, resourceful woman who raised entire graveyards of zombies or slew ghouls? She's too busy having sex in the back seat of her car.She can enjoy her new found powers and partners-I am not enjoying the stories anymore."
1,So sad.,"I picked up the book from the library and still felt cheated after I'd read it. There is only enough plot to keep the erotica progressing. This really should have been published as a Harlequin Romance, except it might even be too graphic for that.To add insult to injury, this book has not been proofread. I stopped counting incorrect spelling, bad grammar and the use of incorrect homophones about halfway through. Does Jove employ editors?"
2,"Sub-par, flawed book","Laurell K Hamilton is so much better than this. The book spends far too much time fretting over Anita's X-rated personal life and never really gets into the crux of the murder mystery we were promised in the beginning. By the end of the book, we don't really know any more about the original plot than when we began, and we know far too much about Anita's bed hopping. This isn't a character ""maturing"", unless you rate maturity by the number of sexual partners a person has. This is a character degenerating."
1,Returning my book,"I am returning this book...The jacket cover an all of the advertisements suggested that Anita was finally up against the ulitmate evil... A serial killer that is a vampire and that preys on strippers.Well, not very original.. because what serial killers don't prey on strippers? but I wanted to see where LKH went with this one.By page 317 of her 650 atrocity named Succubus Dreams, she has devoted only 5 pages to the story line.She is not doing any investigating, she is not being asked to consulate on any Federal cases, she is not doing anything at all but sleeping with anyone and everyone that comes across her path... and then afterwards sharing this information with anyone that comes into her life.I am just going to return this book and buy a magazine or something."
2,Disappointing,"I have read the entire Anita Blake series, and I enjoyed every one until Incubus Dreams. This book was nothing more than vivid soft porn. Every few pages Anita was involved with another partner or several partners. I understand the ""ardeur"" being a new complex issue that needs to be controlled, but it took over the story line. Normally I can not put one of these books down until I have finished. I found myself skimming pages or forcing myself to continue to find the point of endless sex. I hope the next one has more story and less random sexual encounters."
2,Who stole Anita and when will they give her back?,"The early Anita Blake stories were engrossing, something happening on every page. I read them in one sitting, regardless of how late I had to stay up. But the last few have been so focused on sex that any other plot is lost in the bedsheets. Frankly, I am getting turned off by Anita's nonstop sexual activities. She was an action heroine, a woman who knew she was good at what she did. Now, by the time you sort out who she's in bed with and why, you really don't care if you even finish the book. Go ahead, put it down--pick it up tomorrow. You haven't missed anything. This will certainly be the last hardback I buy by Ms. Hamilton."
1,Disappointment is the only word to describe this book.,"I LOVE LKH. My sister and I both buy her books in hardcover because we can't decide who will read it first. We finish these books in well under a week. Incubus Dreams, however, took me 3 weeks to finish. The great suspense that I love about LKH books was completely missing. The book starts with a murder mystery and then it is forgotten until the very end. The middle is Anita having sex with everyone. As if she wasn't already sleeping with enough men, new ones were brought in. The ardeur is getting old. Many of the core characters were completely ignored. Where was Asher? If Damian is now part of a new triumverant why didn't we see him very often?If you are a die hard fan, like me, then you have to read the book in order to move on in the series, but wait for it to come out in paperback."
2,BOOORING!!!,"I agree with the other reviewers. This book contains barely 100 pages of any kind of relevant plot and 4 or 5 hundred pages of kinky sex. It's boring. Please, let's return to the first books in the series, where Anita is a woman with a purpose, who deals with supernatural messiness and solves crimes. If there is an absolute need for mentioning the ""ardeur"", include one sex act, maybe 2. That's it. If I want porn, I'll go buy XXX.I mean, what ever happened to interesting characters, like the 2 kid vampires from the previous book? What about the Mother of Darkness? Why is her waking going to be so disasterous? Give us some PLOT!"
1,Where's the plot???,"SEX....and then some more sex. The plot shows up at odd intervals...occasionally. Well, it's more like the plot is tacked on to a porn story. I used to like this series, before it became nothing more than Hamilton writing down her fantasy life for all to see...It used to have good characters, pace, plot, and that VIBE a good book gives you. But in this one, the author has abandoned any pretense that it is anything more than a porn story.I have no problem with erotica in my fiction. But this isn't erotica. It is poorly written, dull, and cliched sex. Period. I liked most of the previous books because Anita was a strong character. Well-grounded, but with quirks. She has now become nothing more than a cardboard cutout. All I can say is that if LKH isn't interested in developing her characters or their actual involvement in the Anita Blake world, why should we, as readers, be interested in them at all?I am sorry I wasted my money."
2,"Oversexed, but at least it had a plot","This is an improvement over the past two books in the series, in that less than half the book is devoted to sex scenes and the other half actually deals with plot. I think that Ms. Hamilton was trying to work through the sexual material to try and get Anita back on track, so I HOPE that the next book will be back to mostly plot. Basically, the first third of the book is plot development, with minor sex scenes. The next third and a bit beyond is sex, sex, and more sex, to the point that a scene that should have been a pivotal resolution just bored me. (Hint to Ms. Hamilton: less is more; don't try to cram every last sex scenario into one book) The rest goes back to plot for the most part, with a strong hint that the next book will be about finishing up some missed details (not all the bad guys were caught). I'm hoping that means it will be more like Obsidian Butterfly (which I consider to be the high point of the series)."
2,Not up to par,"I started the Anita Blake series when book four had just come out and loved them. Paranormal mystery has always been my cup of tea. Unfortunately this latest version of Anita Blake is noticeably lacking in mystery. Rather it just seems to be page after page of sex. How convenient that Anita now has this ""gift"" that requires her to sleep with every male she happens across. This is nothing like the Anita I grew to love. If I wanted a book about sex I would get a harlequin novel. So, if you want a book full of gratuitous sex this is for you. If, like me, you began reading Anita Blake because of the mystery and casework, I advise you stay away from this one."
1,Don't buy this book!!,"This is by far the worst book of this series. I don't think anyone bothered to proof read it prior to printing it and in the 650 pages, LKH forgot to put in a plot. I started reading her books for the battles that Anita fought and won, this book was Anita having sex with everyone that crossed her path. Her AB books started going downhill with Narcissis in Chains, then Cerulean Sins, and now this. This was the last time I shell out $28 for a book from her."
1,soft porn disappointment,"I loved the first few Anita Blake books. I love the character, and I enjoyed the sexual tension of the series. I enjoyed it as sex became more and more part of the stories. However, there are limits. This isn't a book with a plot, it is a series of soft-porn short stories with repeat characters. The author has even run out of ways to describe things, and repeats phrases several times over trying to describe the climactic moments. I am no longer buying her books new, and will only be looking for used copies, if at all. She has made it clear with the new six hour rule that the next book in the series will be entirely about Anita's sexcapades."
1,More Sue than Q,"I didn't believe it could happen, well don't bet on it, it has been done! At the fifth book the sueness started to show and by this last book it is nothing but. This book is bad, let me count the ways... nevermind I have a life and wasted several hours of it wading through the muck in this book. I'm a man so I can't be a prude, it's an oxymoron. I'm glad I'm a man too. If I were a woman I'd be raising hell about the downward spiral of morphing Anita Blake into the writers stand in from the roof tops. I don't care what writers do behind closed doors, but to advertise it in book form is disgusting and so is this so called novel. That's the only justification there seems to be why this book is what it is. Bad. I couldn't find the plot and it wasn't because I didn't try. This book is definitely not a stand alone and in comparison to the other twelve barely stands at all. Don't buy it, don't borrow it, don't even read it on a bet like me, you'll regret it."
1,This Book Sucked Too.,"I borrowed this book from a neighbor that just started reading this series. I tolds her not to buy anything after book 7, She didn't listen. I hadn't read anything since Narcissus, I am so glad I didn't spend money on this book. If I want porn I'll read Devine or Desseau. I was so disappointed. How could such a great author go so wrong. It is like Hamilton has no concept of her readers needs. I don't mind a little sex in my books, but 500 pages and 5 or six different sex partners is revolting. She started out great with the murder, I just knew that it was the old Anita, then it got gross. I will probably read her again to see if she sees the error of her ways. But it will not be on my dime. This book so sucked!"
4,hmmm,"I am not fond of there being more and more sex scenes in each book, I really think Hamilton needs to tone the sex stuff down. Its still a good series but it just seems to have turned into a supernatural porno with bits and pieces of mystery and crime. I still have faith in LKH and this was a good book, but jeesh theres too much sex in it, thats the only complaint I have.Micah is a spin off book and that was only 200 pages, theres about one whole sex scene in the entire book, now if the same applied or no more than 3 or 4 scenes in the next book that would be fine. But she keeps pushing and pushing with the sex.It drives you nuts...."
3,Definitely Not Hamilton's Best Work,"""Incubus Dreams,"" the 12th installment in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series, will delight loyal and new readers alike. Anita is dealing with a whole slew of personal issues while trying to find a vampire serial killer who is targeting strippers. Anita must learn to control her new power(s) and still nab the bad guys!I felt like I was reading this novel forever! Not because the novel was bad in any way, I just felt like I was reading really slowly. I thoroughly enjoyed Incubus Dreams. I thought Hamilton spent a little too much time on Anita's ""life"" issues and not enough on the actual vampire hunting, but that did not diminish my enjoyment. I can completely understand why other readers are so disappointed, though. Hopefully, she will listen to what we have to say."
2,"Please, can we cut the [bad things] out!","I've read all of the other boooks. Yes, I liked most of them. But this travesty of a book does little to develop the characters, little in story line and reads more like a soft core porn film. If you are truly a fan, you might find something in this book. Otherwise skip it. I just hope that Mrs. Hamilton will get her mind out of the gutter and write a STORY."
1,"Anita, get dressed already.","A really weak book.Practically no plot and way too much sex.Believe me, I don't begrudge Anita her sex life with all the beautiful and supportive were-men. I was delighted when she overcame her prudery and hang-ups - how long can you whine about a cad that ditched you back in college, after all.This book, however, really overdoes it. First there are hundreds of pages of ""we have to talk"" scenes and endless discussion of everybody's sexual needs. Then there are hundreds of pages of sex. Towards the end there is (finally!!) a mention of bad guys and a brief visit to a crime scene that solves nothing.I really wish Anita would put on some clothes and go back to work."
1,Disappointed,"I believe that if one peruses the current collection of reviews, a consensus emerges on what has gone so horribly wrong in the most recent Anita Blake offering. No tension, pointless sex, egregious grammatical errors, etc. I would only like to add this comment made in the author's online blog during the writing process, 'PLOT CALLED ON ACCOUNT OF SEX SCENE, Incubus Dreams'.Truer words were never spoken."
1,Very Disappointed!,"Up until Incubus Dreams I was loving the Anita Blake series. This book is nothing but sex scene after sex scene with little regard to anything resembling a story. Quite frankly I'm sick of the 'ardeur' and Anita is looking more and more like an unpaid whore. Unfortunate, but I'm done with this series. I didn't take the other poor reviews seriously...I thought I would read this myself and make up my own mind. I wish I hadn't spent the money. I couldn't finish this book."
2,"Boy, I hate to kick a book when it's down...","But I tend to agree. Anita's whole struggle to stay herself through what she faced, her humanity in the face of everything was what kept me coming back. I was embarassed to tell people what I was reading because of all the sex, with a crime thrown in to get her off her back once in a while.I miss Edward.There was this whole fascinatiobn built up with Olaf. Let's have him turn up in the next book, see if it brings us back our girl......."
1,Soft Porn Dreams,"This one was really bad. Out of 650+ pages you get 500 of them are focused on Anita's numerous sex partners and her need to have sex with anyone walking by at anytime. It's sad because the little that Ms. Hamilton gives you which dosen't deal with Anita's sex play is good and imaginative and should have been played up more. If that had happend this would have been a great book.Ms. Hamilton has strayed so far from her kick but heroin to this sex starved nympho, it makes you wonder if the author is wrighting what she thinks her fans wants. If she beleives that we want to read page after page of sex then she'll keep putting out this soft porn and pretty soon it won't be so soft.Those of you looking for an author who deals with werewolves, witches, fairies and other little creatures of the night and has this kick butt heroin again, you might want to purchase ""Dead Witch Walking"" by Kim Harrison."
2,Only if you like porn!,"I was really disappointed by this book. It seems in Ms Hamilton's books that you're either a nice girl or you'll `do' anything. Why couldn't Anita be a strong sexual character without losing her personality? The spoilers in R. Clifton ""sithean""'s review (below) pretty much sum it all up. I think this'll be the last book I purchase from this series. The actual story line was about 40 pages. The rest was sex. If that's what you're after - this book is for you. But if you want more storyline then your average b-grade porn movie then I think that it's time to find another author!."
1,"LKH Surrounded by ""Yes"" People Now?","I am a long-time Anita Blake series fan until Incubus Dreams. While the two prior to this had aspects that I didn't like -- they had enough I liked and of the characters I loved to keep going.Either LKH is now surrounded by ""yes"" people because of her success and/or she was in some sort of war with her publisher and on purpose wrote this piece of junk.How can she let her Anita fans down like this? I'm still dreaming that she will announce that Incubus Dreams was a mistake and write the great Anita Blake series book that we all deserve.Frankily if she would drop her Gentry series (way too much romance for my liking) perhaps she could then focus on a good Anita book."
2,I could not finish it.,"I liked the early books in the Anita Blake series. The early books were pleasantly gruesome, and had a quite intelligent idea on how a society where the occult does exist would function. Sex was always in the background; humans would be drawn to the vampires, and the vampires would be all to happy to oblige - at a price.Human relations were only at a business level, also something that would suit a fearless vampire hunter.Now, the characters spend most of their with jealous bickering and sex games. Every few pages there is a snippet of story, which is quite good, but too little of it.Ms Hamilton tries to make her characters three dimensional and realistic, but I fear she succeeds only in watering out the stories and writing second rate human relations dramas and sex manuals."
2,Why?,"Why did she write this book? It is such a step down from all of the other ones in the series. The rest of them are so good, but then this one reads more like a porno than what I have come to expect from her. It didn't advance the story hardly at all. She wrties so well, I expected and anticipated a book as good or better than the previous ones. I hope she gets it back together and the next one continues the excellent work I know she is capable of."
2,Anita does America,"Should be better descriptive of this book. Is there anyone left for her to have sex with? There was so much of it in the story that I started skipping pages to try and avoid the repetitious bordom of it. I feel that Anita who was a courageous,smart and witty character is now just (...) weak and obviously nymphomaniac. I feel MS. Hamilton lost alot of her focus somewhere and about half way through remembered there is suppose to be a story so tried to save it by throwing in a plot, at this point why bother. In my opinion her demoralizing of her characters, herself and her readers is a complete let down. Good luck on the next one."
2,Too much sex,"Incubus Dreams was a book I was waiting for. I was sadly dissapointed that the plots changed to sex. I have read all the books of Anita Blake and found this one to be a little too much like pornography. The book has lots of twist and turns that are not very well explained. I was surprised to see that Richard had made a come-back into the scene. But even worst I was shocked to see how Ainta's harem had grown. It seemed to me that if Anita wasn't having sex with someone or something than she was agruing about it. I am glad that she appears to be more comfortable with herself but enough of the ""drama"". I thought that there was going to be a bit more about the case Anita was working on. Instead it was a sad glimpse into the previous Anita Blake books. What a let down. I hope that the next book will be better and and stick with the orginal plot lines."
1,PWP,"My daughter referred to this book as a ""PWP"" - ""Plot? WHAT plot?"" Yep. Plenty of sex - WAY too much, and woefully short on anything resembling a storyline. Absolutely atrocious - really nonexistent - editing. Deity was misspelled in every instance, as was triumvirate. How can something as crucial to the story be misspelled EACH and EVERY time? Grammatical errors, syntax problems, punctuation trouble...my guess is the editors at Penguin/Berkely gave this one to the rookie because they couldn't handle the misery themselves. Apart from the editing is the lack of anything reminiscent of the first few books in the series. Sorry, Laurell. Hope the next one's better!"
2,Pretend it's not part of the series,"Less sex, more plot and butt kicking. I loved the first books when Anita spent more time kicking butt and less time in the sack. If I want porn, I'll go get a porn book. I got hooked on this series because of the great characters and the non-stop action. What happened to that? Ms. Hamilton, leave your porn penmanship for the other series, let Anita get back to being Anita.I have been able to finish the last few books in a few hours just by skipping over the sex scenes. That tells you how much they lack in plot and action.What a shame. It was such a great series. I don't bother to buy the books in hardcover anymore. If I can't borrow one, I wait for paperback. Why waste the money. I no longer eagerly await each new book as it comes out."
2,Am I really saying too much sex?,"Yes.....Sloppy writing, too many repititions, and a weak plotline that kept disappearing in the steam ......Yes, there was some good developement in characters like Nathanial and Richard, but where was Asher? I feel overwhelmed with periphrial characters that keep gathering around, but we don't know anything about them because we are spending so much time in Anita's bedroom....oh wait, most of the sex wasn't IN the bedroom, and I can honestly say that, metaphysical powers or not, no one can have as much sex as she did and still walk. And I did not like having a murder in the beginning of the story, and then hardly any mention of the details until it was all quickly wrapped up in the last 50 pages."
1,Damn...,"I'm a big fan fiction fan so I'm used to characters being out of character but damn it I'm not used to it from the original writer. [...] She's not Anita anymore, she's some Mary sue that took over and replaced my favorite heroine. The only thing I can compare it to is when Buffy went from super slayer girl to the slayer slut who slept with Spike every chance she got. But at least Buffy had an excuse, she died. Yes Anita has to feed the ardeur but the Anita I remember from the past books wouldn't feed off every thing in pants. It's just not her! If I wanted to read badly written Anita Blake smut I would have looked online for a badly written smutty fan fic. No, I spent my money hoping to get a wonderful supernatural murder mystery and I got cheated. I'm not even going to bother trying to sell this piece of trash, I'm dumping it off at Goodwill. Maybe someone there will like it."
2,Eh... Interesting,"I have to preface this by saying this is the first book by Ms. Hamilton I've ever read. Given my other purchases, amazon always recommends her so I picked this up on a whim. It's good to know that this book isn't typical based on other reviews, so I may go back and read the first book, because I like the author's style if not the content. But generally this book sucked, IMO. Anita has sex with anything that walks. Hamilton makes it somewhat palatable by giving her some angst over it but still, this is ridiculous. And the 'mystery', there is one murder at the beginning of the book, then some 300-400 pages later there is another murder and there's been no investigation, Anita just screws her way through a variety of men until the next murder happens and then gets some real clues as to who might be doing this. I do find the various vampire, lycanthrope and other occult story lines interesting, but it doesn't really make up for the weak plot."
1,Pornography or Novel?,"Having previously read all of the Anita Blake series, I must say Incubus Dreams is indeed the worst book of the series as of yet. The writing is shallow, as is the plot - and the book is utterly focused on SEX. Rather than the casual, and not too tacky commonplace sex scenes of the series, Hamilton has gone way overboard. This book has been bombarded with scene after scene of raunchy sex. One can barely find the plot at all in this book - which happens to be more like a pornography magazine than anything close to a novel.Unless you are a die-hard fan, I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this book, but rather, if you must, borrow it from a library or a friend. Also if you are a parent, keep your son or daughter away from this book, lest they add some less than wholesome words to their repertoire. Good luck."
1,Can I rate this less than one star?,"I loved the first few books in the series but it was at this book that the series took a turn for the worse. I was so upset to see the heroine I had come to love turned into a horny moron. The writing seemed to get sloppy and lazy. For example, the phrase ""sleeping/cuddling/laying around like a pile of puppies"" appears now in all her books. It drives me nuts. If you want hard core porn held together by a flimsy badly written plot then by all means by this book. Otherwise I strongly suggest that you check out Charlaine Harris or the Dark Hunter series. They are much much better."
1,Diluted pleasure,"I have read all of the Hamilton books so far, and have to say that this was by far the least interesting of the batch. I simply could not finish the book. I had to write a review.Seemingly gone are the raising the dead days for Anita Blake, and the agency days, which were so interesting - to be replaced with page after page of unnecessary and repetitive descriptions of the ""pard"" dudes. After ten chapters in this newest book, we still hadn't gotten beyond mundane descriptions, none of them any different from the over-lengthy descriptions of the guys in her Kiss of Shadows book. With no real story at chapter twelve, I gave up."
2,Save your money. Wait for the paperback.,"Incubus Dreams is easily the weakest offering in the Anita Blake series. There's a neat 350 page novel in a 680 page extended orgy. The murder mystery is merely paid lip service--kind of like the hit man who wants the zombie raised in Cerulean Sins. Yes, Anita sort of starts getting a handle on her personal life, but Hamilton adds so many other issues that it's just getting ridiculous. Add in Hamilton's overdone repetition, numerous editing/spelling flaws, and a plot that never works because the reader gets bombarded with scene after scene after scene after scene of ardeur-spawned hedonism, and you get a mess. Incubus Dreams bored me to tears. I have never said that about an Anita Blake book before. I'll never say it again. If the next book is as bad as this one, I'm done."
1,Hamilton has ruined the Anita Blake series,"What a terrible book! 500 hundred pages of sex and only about 200 pages of a real story. Anita is more or less a nympho now -- she'll have sex with just about anyone. Maybe Dolph is next! I miss all the great story lines where she is actually hunting non-human killers. Jean-Claude has actually become close to uninteresting. Anita is almost to the point that she doesn't really need him or Richard. Also, I have never taken to Micah; his description is not very masculine & doesn't appeal to me like Jean-Claude or Richard did. If I wanted a book with little plot and a lot of sex, I'd read ""Deep Throat"". I will probably keep on reading the series but I will never buy a new copy again. It will be the used book store from now on."
1,Utter Trash,"For those of us who recall Hamilton's first 3 or so Anita Blake novels, we can lay to rest any hope of novels like them appearing again. Every book I read of Hamilton's grows progressively worse.The entire Anita Blake series had degenerated into plotless pornographic filth. A useless waste of money. Unfortunately, I cannot rate this review lower than one star.Oh - I tried reading the first meredith gentry novel as well, which I RETURNED for my money back (after reading about 20 pages)with a complaint about adult material being carried without labels (lol, hopefully the bookstore will pull all of Hamilton's books)."
1,More A Page Flipper Than A Page Turner,"I have been reading the Anita Blake books since the beginning of the series. The early books are wonderful and I highly recommend them. I stuck with the series through the ""less than stellar navel gazing porn"" novels thinking that the series would rebound. Not a chance.As the other reviewers have said, it's a meaningless, thinly rationalized, mostly boring porn film on paper. No sooner does a new character show up than you can count the seconds until Anita is ""forced"" to bed them for one pointless reason or another. As for plot - well, you could pull out all the pages actually related to the purported storyline, bind them together and maybe (if properly edited) have a short story of moderate interest.I'd say Incubus Dreams has driven a stake through the heart of this series - what a shame."
2,Yaaawwwnnnn,I'm sorry about this bad review but I was so bored I couldnt wait to be done with this book. Too much sex ...(even though thats not bad it was excelent in the other books) with too little murder investigation maybe LKH will get on the right track with the next book...cant wait to read it!!!
1,Dream off ; Move on,"I'm expecting a sexier version of the vampire killer who does police work when I continue reading this series. If I want porn I can buy real porn, not a repetitive and boring misrepresented, disappointing waste of time. After Narcissus, I realized I had better save my money and I wisely turned to my library. At least I didn't waste my money on this one. After reading a bit and scanning through the same old arduer garbage, I read the other reviews and decided to move on. If I can't read about the vampire hunter who raises the dead here, I'll just find a different author. Too bad. I liked Anita and didn't mind her sexual morality changes. If only I could revisit the knives, Edward, and the shady customers at Animation Inc. I could get the read I am expecting when I pick up a part of this series. The author should have categorized the books after Obsidian including this one in a new series called Anita Blake Dreams on, Drools on."
1,Lovers of the early books AVOID this at all costs !!!,Well I just got done the copy I borrowed from a friend and I have to say I am glad I refused to but it until I did.Leaving aside the extreme number of editing and spelling problems aside the plot what little there was of it was good but it needed more fleshing out and less bare flesh and trashy and sex scenes that any fanfic writer could post.I know its harsh but this book blows chunks and the author has clearly let her writing style for the Merry Gentry series ruin this series.If I want a trash sex scene I would read her other series or better yet online free stories that actually are better staged then the author does hers.If you loved the first 7 - 8 books then avoid this book at ALL costs and do not waste your cash on this piece of toilet paper pretending to be one of the books for formely excellant series.
2,A Real Disapointment,"This book is one of two things, either a depressingling pathetic end to a great series, or a sagging disaster in the middle of one. After the foreshadowing in the last book, I had high hopes for this book, but it is nothing more than baddly written sex scenes. I can only hope that this book is a rushed attempt to keep the series going under publishing pressure, rather than something the author thought was a good continuation of the story."
2,Hard to get through,"I am lost on this book for the fact it has me so frustrated!!! I'm frustrated with the direction of the book and the lack of likeability of these characters! Everyone is whining about this and that, plus they all seem so needy and want to argue all the time. BLAH! I want to read a book that takes me out of the BS of life by having a good storyline and read one that does not annoy me. I'm not even half way through the book and I want to move on to the next. I find myself skipping whole sections of it just to get through it so I don't miss anything before I start the next book.OK now I'm whining. ;-) I like the author and know it's not easy to continue a series this long but I really miss her old style of writing. However.....I will finish this series one way or another!"
2,Done with the series,"My biggest complaint is that Ainta has been turned into a total slut and I am just sick of it. As Jean-Claud puts it, she sure has a hell of a lot of accidental sex.I didnt even finish this book. I just dont respect her as a character. I had no problem with sex being added to the series, nor to her dating more than one man but now its ridiculous, enough is just enough. Anita is now nothing more than a whore who whines and complains that she just cant help herself.I actually read reviews on the books ahead before deciding to totally abandon the series, and from what I have read it doesnt get any better. There are too many people all vying for a spot in Anita's bed, and worse they are all getting it.There isnt much suspense and dective work and stuff like that left and I just cant stand Anita anymore."
5,"Sex, Plot, Fun","Lots of sex. Lots of plot. Lots of fun to read if you have enjoyed the last few books of the series and don't have a problem with the developement of Anita's powers and personality becoming more intensely sexual. While there is not much mystery, there is a great deal of world building and focus on the supporting cast of the series, as well as more character growth for Anita in her personal relationships. This book is full of information, clearly setting up many upcoming storylines.Loads of sex, but that didn't bother me. I'm pretty happy to see Anita finally get past the hangups she has had before and finally begin to take pleasure in the necessity of feeding her Ardeur, and make the power it brings her into a useful tool instead of a cross to bear.I think I got a lot of entertainment and enjoyment for my money's worth. I'm looking forward to the next book."
4,Bring Back Edward!,"I love Laurell's work on this series, but I have to say the past two books (including this one) are moving away from what she originally started with the series. I have been a fan since Guilty Pleasures and have turned many friends on to reading the series, but I'm starting to become disappointed with the way Anita's character is going. Personally I think we need to have Edward make a long awaited appearance in the next book!! I still thought the book was great, but it's not a 5 star like I've given most of the other books in the series."
3,2 Books in 1,"Just think of this book as a break from the main story line. Laurell gives you 2 stories. The titles could be: ""Anita Does St.Lois"" and ""The One That Got Away"".The first story is an erotic free for all,The second Anita really bombing a case. Hopefully,the next book ""Danse Macabre"" will resume the story."
3,not her best,"I am a big fan of Laurell Hamilton. I have read all of the Anita Blake novels and found them all page turners except this one. It seems to me she got Anita mixed up with her other character Merideth Gentry who is trying to get pregnant. I can understand Meredeth's preoccupation to couple with the guys. Her life and kingdom depend on it. Anita has always impressed me as a tough woman who was a protector of the innocent first and plaything of the undead and lycanthrope second. In this book the murder mystery barely made it into the story for all the triumverate bonding going on. Between her own bloodletting and other body fluids flowing it is amazing she was still alive, let alone able to function and save the day (or night as the case may be)."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers. I, too, loved the previous Anita Blake books, but found Incubus Dreams extemely boring and disappointing. The mystery part of the book was barely touched on but pages and pages of sex with almost anyone, in any circumstances, got boring very fast. I do hope that Laurel Hamilton gets back from her sexual fantasies and gets better plots."
2,Where is the old Anita?,"I have to agree with my esteemed peers below. I especially agree with the idea of deepsixing Richard and sending Anita to training. This book would have been half as long (it is 658 pages) if the unnecessary sex was cut out. Ms. Hamilton seems to be searching for ways for Anita to have sex with new and different people. I still enjoyed the mystery and Anita's ascerbic wit, but the sex was excessive."
1,Getting Worse,"The stories in Laurell Hamilton's first Anita Blake books were incredibly interesting and captivated me with humor, intelligence, creativity and action. However, since creating the subject of ""ardeur"", the only action Ms. Hamilton seems to be able to come up with for her heroine, Anita Blake, happens between the sheets. Instead of chasing unusual monsters and saving people from fates worse than death, we are ""treated"" to intense sexual exploits every other page. Come on, Laurell, Anita used to be a lot more interesting when she was not constantly horizontal. I have read all of the Anita Blake books and sincerely wish I had not read this last book."
2,What Happened?,"I've been a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton since I first picked up Guilty Pleasures over ten years ago. But with her newest novel I have to say she's lost me as a reader. Over the last few books Mrs. Hamilton has focused more on sex and less on plot. Her latest book Incubus Dreams is now 95% sex, and 5% plot. Anita is now sleeping with 6 people on a regular basis, and a couple more on a not so regular basis. I don't mind sex in the books that I read, but if I wanted to read a book that is all sex I'd of picked up a book out of the erotica section. This book is supposed to be about a vampire serial killer. That plot line is barely touched on in this book at all, and it's conclusion is not particularly satisfying. Suffice to say, If I decide to read her next book I'll take it out of the library first.Save your money."
2,Ho Hum,"WOW! I only recently got into the Anita books, say about two weeks. I bought all of the books in the series and blew threw them, even this one. From the beginning of the series Hamilton has built up to the sex scenes up to the point that sex was all this book was about; over 600 pages of sex. I'm not a prude in any sense of the word, but it was just a bit much. All the other books had a big bad that she struggled against throughout the entire book. This book was just one sex scene after the other, and if she wasn't doing it she was thinking about it or talking about it or about to do it. It's almost as if Hamilton is stuggling for a plot and she just couldn't do it in this book. Hopefully, Hamilton can pull herself out of the sated after sex haze before she looses readers."
1,I want that twenty-five dollars back...,"I guess my feelings about ""Incubus Dreams"" can be summed up with one phrase: not bad, but not terribly good either. It's actually kind of sad, considering that the series used to be *so* good and has now become merely mainstream erotica. Anita has turned from a powerful, kick-ass character to one who is whiny, shrill, and eye-roll inducing. And, well, to be honest, I think every character got on my last nerve during reading this--Micah, especially. Does anyone think he and Anita have any actual chemistry? Because they kind of come off with all the combined sex appeal of curdled milk.The second trio was another low--ummm, what about the first one which was infinitely more interesting and actually relevant to the series? What this AB series needs, if it's going to continue with any readership at all is for Anita to get control of the ardeur (as, relegate it to the background), shed the misc. boyfriends and, once again, get a spine and a clue."
2,Enough Already!,"I have really enjoyed this series of books - up to this point. I am really dissappointed in Ms. Hamilton's repetitive use of ideas. I mean we went from a vampire slayer with high morals and intense romantic relationships to having sex with 5 or 6 different guys in one book! And she can't just have sex with one guy, it has to be two at the same time. And why is it everytime Anita shows up to a crime scene there is someone there that has some sort of beef with her being there. Ms. Hamilton also gets really wordy in this book. She uses analogies until they are dead, and all in the same chapter. There are some good storylines here hidden in all of this stuff. Anita developing new powers is pretty cool. The book should focus more on that than feeding the ""ardeur"". How many times do we read about the ardeur? It starts to get really old. And all of the sex she is continuously having with all of these people, pretty old too."
1,Anita Blake is screwed!,"Does anyone else think that this ardeur is a stupid, contrived excuse to get AB to get laid with all those monsters? Of course you do, hence all of the negative reviews. It is poorly written and a cheap excuse to turn AB into a Wonderslut. Getting laid seems to be the forefront of the story; she even saves lives by having sex. Shyeah. Micah shares a painful part of his past? She's all shocked and sympathetic but really she just wants to get laid. There's a vampire killing strippers? She wants to find the vamp but not before she gets laid. She wants to straighten out her life and relationships with her men, but there are more pressing matters in life for her, like getting laid. This ardeur needs to be stopped. It's a good thing LKH is already a bestselling author 'cause she never would have gotten a book deal if she had started with this garbage. I think I'll pass on the other books."
1,No Plot!,To me this was the worst book in the series. It was no plot and all porn. Sure I like the hot steamy sex that are in most of her books but this was way over the top.
1,The Death of Anita Blake,"After reading a few of the reviews, I really don't have anything new to add. Just wanted to register my displeasure at the destruction of a great series. I agree with every negative thing said in the other reviews (and few of the positive ones). If you like this stuff, read her Meredeth Gentry series which started out this way and continued it. I see no difference between them now."
1,Paging Laurell Hamilton,"What gives? I have been a devoted fan of yours since Guilty Pleasures came out, but lately I have been very disappointed. The last few books have been almost about nothing but sex. Yeah, sex is great, but not when it is written to the exclusion of all else. It is not only in the Anita series, but also in the Meredith series.What happened to the well-written, adventure packed books you used to write so well that no one could put them down? I miss those. My advice is not to buy these books until she begins to have a storyline again where characters actually talk to one another instead of just boinking."
1,DON'T. BUY. THIS. BOOK!,"With its many pages of stupid, perverted sexual activity (prettied up by calling it ""feeding the ardeur""), and the talking, talking, talking about the relationship(s), there wasn't any room for like ... an actual story. And would it have killed somebody to edit and proof the thing? Off-putting and boring as all get-out. As far as the series (and quite possibly anything else from LKH) I'm tapped. Borrow this from your library - I'm SERIOUS."
2,Well...hmmm,"Sex is a good thing, but honestly, there is too much sex in too much detail in this extremely long book. I vaguely remember the plotline, but kept losing track of it as I marvelled that the woman who does not have sex with someone ""unless it MEANS something"" was sleeping with yet another man/shifter/vampire. She did not shower much either. I was left with a sense of ""yuck"", and what happened to Damien's storyline, Gregory & Stephen's father, Louie/Ronnie. All they did was have crisis after crisis related to the ardeur and anita not ""feeding"" it enough so she had to sleep with someone else to avert disaster. AND the will she or won't she GO ALL THE WAY with Nathaniel storyline is ridiculous and took 50 million years to resolve...I read it and enjoyed the time in Anita's world, but that was it. It definitely was not her best effort."
2,Not her best work,"While I could never ""hate"" LKH's work, this was not my favorite. If you are looking for answers or continuity from previous books, you won't get it. It was high on prose and porn, low on plot or storyline regarding the serial killing advertised in the jacket of the book, or even a mention of what happened the last few chapters of the previous book.I was very frustrated with the lack of backround storyline, and missed Anita dealing with people in every day life ...meaning relationships and meeting new people without having sex.The 8 to 10 different partners, on multiple occassions within a 48hour time frame, without the luxury of a shower was too much for me.I'm far more interesed in the Merry series and the unveiling of the world of fae as well as the people we are meeting in those two courts than I currently am with the world of Anita.If you love Anita, buy this book, but don't expect it to be anything like the first few books. (Sorry to the fans...I really am one too!)"
1,I would like to give it 1/2 a Star,"This book, in hardback form or paperback, is a total waste of money. I don't know what Miz Hamilton problem is but if she just wants to write graphic sex after graphic sex just to bother 'people in the publishing industry disturbed by erotic content' then she isn't giving a damn about her readers. An as readers we should do the same by not buying her books.Untill Miz Hamilton grows up an stops acting like a six-teen year old girl everyone is well advised to avoid her books.""Hamilton: In my books, the reason the eroticism is so high is that people in the publishing industry were disturbed by erotic content. Not for its own sake, but because I was a woman writing from a first-person woman's point of view. Had I been a man, they would have been okay with it. The erotic content has risen because they told me it shouldn't only because I am a woman writing about a woman. It's what my grandmother calls being contrary"""
1,Anita - where'd you go?,"OK - only 220 pages into this and alreay hate it. Anita, the kicks ass and takes names hero is gone -- turned into a sniveling whiner. I don't mind a little porn with my vampire action novel but this one goes on and on and NOTHING happens. The entire first 200 pages could have been done in a chapter. AND MOVE ON ALREADY!!! WE GET IT!!! Man, this is a boring read. And note to Berkeley Publishing: hire a damned proofreader! Diety is NOT a word! Get a spell checker for Pete's sake. For $25 I expect you to at least use the English language properly."
2,Geez c'mon Anita,"Agreed and agreed with the other two reviews. I used to think: geez Anita do it shut up and get on with it already. A little obsessing is okay but for God's sake lady! So what do she do? She does it (and does it and does it. . .) and won't shut up and I totally lost the story somewhere in all that. Dammit LKH please don't lose a marvelous series in a gordian knot of unresolved and ultimately boring sexual fantasy.She seems to be drawing all of her character into extreme caricatures of themselves rather evolving into stronger versions, as I believe she intended.Is Laurell (and Anita) getting tired?"
1,The ardeur needs to be fed with electronic equipment...,"This book was so bad.Bad Bad Bad.I have decided to leave it unfinished. There was no plot. So far Anita has had sex with 8 men/animals, mostly in groups...Uh,the murders and conversations with cops only took up maybe 2 chapters per murder but then Anita jumps into bed, or floor, or car, or whatever is handy, and that takes up about a hundred pages each escapade.The book is not worth buying, check it out from your local library instead but make sure to get it back on time because it is not even worth the late fees. :("
2,Anyone who read the series knows why it only gets 2!,"Maybe I'm being harsh, but what the heck happened to the refreshing writing? If I want porn, I'll surf the net! I don't need to pay for it... especially to keep reading about a good main character turned slut. Hamilton needs to realize she had something amazing going and she's ruining it and watering it down with all the ""F-me!"" garbage. I can see where she was trying to go with it all, but honestly, she should just glaze over the sex scenes and move on with the plot, not spend 70% of the book on it. I'm near the end now and she's just now getting to the murder investigation! WTF happened to the story? I put good money into that book and I wanted a good book. A major let down... hopefully, the next on will get back on track. I can deal with the poor editing though it's annoying, but poor writing- it's just sad!"
1,Awful,"I wasn't expecting much out of this book based on the last couple of books in the series, and I wasn't dissapointed. I'm a big fan of the earlier books in the Anita Blake Series, but this book isn't one I'd recommend to anyone. Incubus Dreams doesn't actually have a storyline. It's basically about Ms. Blake's need to screw everything in sight. I think it's time to end the series if the author isn't going to put any thought into writing it, because I miss the Anita Blake who walked into any situation with her guns blazing, not ready to make out."
2,Someone wake up Mz. Hamilton!,"I love this series, but like the vast majority of the rest of her readers, I am personally sick of where she is taking this series. What happened to the books that would keep me up all night non-stop reading waiting to find out who the bad guy was, or terrified of the evil that was appearing in the investigation. Now, it's just bouncing from one sex scene to another. C'mon, Laurell, get your libedo off the keyboard and give us the old Anita Blake series back!"
2,I don't think this book was worth the read...,"If I had to recommend Laurell K. Hamilton's novels to a friend -- I would definitely steer them towards her earlier work. I found this book to be too Anne Ricean (you know -- stream of consciousness writing, poor editing and a cast of thousands). The many gratuitous sex scenes are monotonous and uninteresting (they seem to be tacked on just to fill pages) and there appears to be little or no plot -- creating an unwieldy and excessively long novel.Hamilton used to be an innovative and amusing writer -- with good character development and plots that involved the reader. Her stories were filled with snappy dialogue, fun twists and turns and nice characterizations -- in short, they were cleverly written and never boring. Unfortunately, I can't say that about her books now -- she seems to have lost her way. A once good author, I hope she goes back to her earlier style of writing."
5,A Must-See Film,"Three women fighting breast cancer spend a day at photographer Elsa Dorfman's studio, posing for her large-format Polaroid camera while they laugh, cry, tell bad jokes, make fun of themselves, and reveal their hearts. Whether or not you have cancer or know anyone who does, this story will inspire you to live your life fully. I know that sounds trite, but the energy, spirit, and grace these three women display truly makes this one worth seeing. It's upbeat without being dishonest, true without being preachy, and educational without being didactic. I'd like to grow up to be like these three."
5,"A ""Must See"" Documentary","No Hair Day is a ""Must See"" documentary film for cancer patients, their families, friends and anyone who supports them through the ordeal of cancer. It focuses on the human side of cancer: the tears, the laughter, the power of a positiveattitude. The three women, Debbie Dorsey, Libby Levinson, and Carol Potoff, all breast cancer patients, share their thoughts and fears and humor as they participate in a photo shoot of themselves--3 bald women from chemotherapy. Elsa Dorfman,the portrait photographer and Bob Burns the videographer are masters at capturing the bravery, beauty and dignity of 3 bald women with cancer. This is a ""must see."""
5,"Candid, touching and times confrontational","As the daughter of one of the survivors featured in this video, I may be biased in my opinion of this documentary. ""No Hair Day"" is a candid, touching and at times confrontational story that tracks how three women experience living with breast cancer. They reveal a range of emotions from fear and anger to irreverence and insouciance that women and families dealing with this disease will undoubtedly identify with."
1,Poor design,Used with Weber Silver grill. Lid would not shut as it hits the basket handle. Designed not to flip either. Poor design.
5,Grill Basket,"I searched high and low for this basket, or at least one that served a particular purpose. The basket I was searching for was one that could be used to grill fairly thin items, and hold them together, like grilling ground sausage for a soup recipe I had. The recipe called for ""an asian meat grilling basket"" but I couldn't find one. This basket serves that purpose and yet, is adjustable, so it can hold food items that are fairly thin to food items as thick as a thick steak. For me, it totally serves the purpose it was intended for."
3,Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon: A Moon Star is Born!!,"This, the first episode of the international hit Japanese series Bishojo Senshi (Pretty Soldier) Sailor Moon opens with the series usual glimmer of humor and irepressable magic touch... although some of the beauty of the show is definitly lost in translation, and the animation is not so good as it is later on in the series, this is still a good introduction to the long-running epic that is Sailor Moon. END"
3,You may want to get the other starting video of the saga,"Well, I dedinately don't like the two episodes only, but the movie is still okay. Anf if you can't find the other first video of the sailor moon saga, then get this one if you really need it.First episode:This is the episode "" where it starts"". A young girl named Serena Tsukino is given a brooch by her guardian cat Luna. And she must save her best friend Molly from an evil monster.Second episode:This new program is on the radio called Love Line. If a person's letter is read on the air, than that person gets a flower brooch... then you doze off. When Molly falls asleep, Serena knows something is wrong."
2,not so great,"I baught this movie a while ago, It's an ok movie . it has the first ever dic (cut) episode of sailor moon on it and one other episode, I forget which though . SO if your expecting an anime uncut original don't get this!!!! END"
2,too boring,"its funny for somebody who havent seen it yet. but if you watch it about 2 times, it get boring fast."
1,1 star was being generous......,"I'm used to Japanese Sailormoon, and I was shocked when I saw this! It is super-cencored, and the voices are totally messed up. My advice to everyone- Stick with Japanese Sailormoon. NA Sailor Moon is abysmal. I've got one more thing to say- In Japanese, about Sailormoon.BSSM no bishoujo to kakkoi, Haruka to Michiru no kawaii wa ai, Chibi Chibi no kawaii, Chibi-usa no baka. END"
5,excellent fantasy program.,the show is heavily cut in the united states just like dario argento's creepers ( a.k.a. phenomena) was heavily cut but now creepers is uncut and sailor moon will be uncut for the first time.
3,For DiC fans this is great,"For those who love the DiC adapted version of Sailor Moon this is great. But I have seen the orginal by Naoko and this is pretty bad. But for all those NA version fans, this is a must have"
5,A MUST SEE!,"IN THE FIRST EPISODE WE LEARN WHO SAILOR MOON REALLY IS, WHERE SHE CAME FROM AND SHY SHE MUST WORK TO PROTECT EARTH. I WONT' TELL YOU ANYMORE-YOU'LL HALF TO SEE THE VIDEO! THIS A TRUE MUST SEE AND YOU WILL NEVER REGRET YOU BOUGHT IT."
5,"A great, hugely important Sailor Moon video","I am a huge fan of Sailor Moon. I love the show. I began to watch Sailor Moon, when Queen Beryl was stealing the rainbow crystals. I was always wondering, how did she get to be Sailor Moon?, How did she get Luna?, how did she react, when she first became Sailor Moon?, all of these questions were answered. I simply love this video, the sound is great, and the picture is great. Every Sailor Moon fan needs this video!"
5,"Great Music, Great Value","Before I got into classical music, this was hands down the best bargain CD I owned. Some of you out there may not believe this but Chick Corea actually used to play good music. The trio recordings he made for Blue Note in the late 60s, in their own way, are every bit as challenging and rewarding as those by Bill Evans, Paul Bley, and even Thelonious Monk. ""Early Days"" finds Chick with a larger band (including such greats as Woody Shaw, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette, Bennie Maupin and Hubert Laws) playing music similar in style to ""Bitches Brew,"" of which Corea was a contributor. Tracks like ""The Brain,"" ""Waltz For Bill Evans"" and ""Jamala"" are as wild as anything from the period. Corea would continue his experiments next with the group Circle, and to a lesser extent with the fusion-oriented Return to Forever. Those who like Corea's Akoustic Band work will be best served skipping this CD (not to mention trading in your CDs for some real music)."
2,Marshalls Creek Sage,"The quality of Marshalls Creeks Sage is less than ideal. The ""sealed"" container is not really ""sealed at all"" I had spider webs and mold (somehow) in some other herbs I purchased from them. I personally wouldn't recommend this product."
4,radical---and dashing!,"I know this book takes a lot of flak, but I adore it. Halberstam rips through transhistorical definitions of lesbianism to reveal a multitude of queer 'masculinities,' from female husbands, FTMs, butches...She's been accused of fetishizing masculinity and not critiquing it at all, but I find this to be untrue. I think that, in separating so-called masculinity from maleness, she reclaims what can be striking and powerful about the genders we've labelled ""masculine"" and in doing so critiques the ways domination has been embedded in traditional male masculinity. This book is truly breakthrough, and I urge you to buy it, and read it, and mull it over. Amazing."
3,"Great ideas, but something is lacking.","Halberstam's ideas around being a masculine female have helped me gain acceptance of my own masculinty. For this reason, the book was groundbreaking for me. However, it's a difficult book to find pleasure in reading because of the hyper academic language and its emotional distance from anything personal or of human interest. The books that are close to my heart about gender and that have been pleasureable to read are Persistent Desire and Stone Butch Blues because they tell a story about the human side of being a masculine female. I'm glad someone's picking apart gender in 1950's film, but it doesn't do to much for me."
5,Insightful analysis of female masculinity,"When picking up a book that does not purport to be anything other than academic, one must be prepared for the contents to be just that - academic. Halberstam writes well, her ideas are important, and she adds complexity and insight into several areas of scholarly research and debate. I would strongly recomend this to anyone interested in feminism, gender, difference and social justice."
5,a stunning history of female masculinity,"A highly readable and stunning history of female masculinity in Britain and the USA, considering court cases, literature, film, pop culture and drag king performances. I learned that the most interesting masculinities are not male, and that the history of the occlusion of butchness is a crucial foundation for understanding gender construction of all kinds."
3,The generative work on female masculinity,"I'm not a big fan of Halberstam's structure of argumentation, but if you are interested in female masculinity, you need to read this book."
2,Nothing new here,"Halberstam's latest book is a rather lackluster rehashing of the latest trend in queer theory. Instead of endless pages of highly problematic ethnographic research, Halberstam would have been much better served if she had included a fem perspective in her unabashed celebration of butch subjectivity. A rather ho-hum effort from an otherwise promising young scholar. One only hopes that she can live up to the promise of her earlier book, Skin Shows."
4,Cute But Overpriced,"The anklet is so darned cute, but I think it was overpriced. Otherwise I would have rated it a 5.If I had the option of handling the item, I would not have made the purchase at that price."
5,Huge bottle,"I thought for the price, this would be a small bottle, but was very surprised to see it was a big bottle. This will last me a lifetime! Happy"
5,Water conditioner,"I use this water conditioner all the time. It does a very good job. I have two turtles and they can be very picky. They seem to like it when I put this conditioner in their water. Fast, free shipping!"
2,Thick and did not dissolve,I don't trust this conditioner because it was as thick as honey and didn't distribute properly through the water. I had globs of it floating in the tank. Maybe I just got an old bottle.
2,Makes the water slimy,I normally get a ultra-concentrated supplement but ordered this one because I did not have time to go to the fish store.This stuff left a file on the water and made the fountain foam. I measured it correctly because I had just cleaned out the aquarium and rinsed the rocks.I'm just not happy with it and hope the fish are okay. I'm not saying don't buy it but I won't get it a second time.
2,There is better stuff out there that isn't as costly,"So, I used this initially when I first got an aquarium because someone else told me they used it. At first all was fine, it does what it needs to do by getting rid of the ammonia/chlorine from tap water.Here's the thing, these water conditioners that have ""slime coat"" crap in them, the way they work is by BURNING the fish, the irritation induces them to produce their slime coat. I wasn't aware of this, but when I was using it, I noticed that some of my fish would always flash - swim rapidly up and down the glass - I didn't know if it was them being ""excited"" to have a water change, no, they were just in pain/stressed.Anyway, after coming to the end of my bottle in like 1 month's time, I ordered Seachem Safe (powder version of Prime). My fish no longer flash, and it works better, way more cost efficient. Save your money, buy Safe or Prime, both are way better."
5,You know the drill,I have fish. They need safe water to survive. This makes my tap water safe enough for them to survive. It's cheaper on Amazon than at pet stores.
3,Decent.,"I like this product because it has a good price attached to it. But it doesn't last very long. I'd prefer to use Seachem Prime all day because that'll last me close to a year, but when I am short on cash and out of prime, I use this without any issues."
2,AquaSafe Water conditioner,Does not work as stated. Bottle is almost empty and water is still not clear. Going to another product.
5,You have to have it,"If you have fish, you have to change or add water to the tank on occasion. Hopefully you add water after you vacuum the gravel. I know when I vacuum my tank I take about 4 gallons of water per cleaning. It's removed to a 5 gallon bucket, and allows me to move my bucket without spilling on the way to dump the water. Be warned that the 4 gallons of clean water weighs 32 pounds. You need to lift it to the top of your aquarium and slowly add it to the existing water.I mix this water conditioner the night before I change the water. I put the conditioner in the bucket and add the water to the bucket so it gets properly mixed. Doing this the night before gives the water a chance to reach room temp where my aquarium typically stands.I have found that using a medicine dropper is the most accurate way to get the correct portion of the additive.By buying this product on Amazon you are going to save over 50% of what your pet store charges."
5,A great inquiry into the diverse nature of the Etruscans.,"Leland provides great insight into suppressed information related to the old Etruscan Paganism of the Early Roman Empire and Italy. The first part of the book contains descriptive insight into over 60 Gods and Goblins of the old religion, whereas, most other texts only contain up to 25 and often confuse the details. A greater number of suppressed names and deities are discussed in detail in this work, then in any other text I have researched in relation to this old way of life. The second part offers various Incantations, Divinations, Medicines, and Amulet Creation. The book is heavily illustrated which is another thing that is uncommon in books on this subject. This book is highly recommended for anyone studying the occult, and makes for a great desk reference for followup research."
4,Alot of info that would be lost...,"This book is really interesting in the fact that had not Leland gathered all this information it would most likely be lost to us today. I would not however recommend it as a BOS to follow ,mainly because we do not know the real context of these spells. Even though Leland has written them down they are from another time and one we are no longer a part of. This is just my opinion and I recommend if you do use a spell from this book you should know why you are using a certain herb, object etc. and WHO you are calling on!Just a precaution I would take. Ciao!"
5,Surf's Up!,"Awesome Dick-Dale influenced sounds that make one run for the shoreline between the jazzy twangs of the formidable bass and the taunting leads.Tasty.I'd throw it more than 5 stars if I could. My tastes include SCI, Dead, MMW, blues and jazz."
2,Great-but it breaks,"my son loved this toy. It was his favorite Christmas toy, but it broke a week later! Turns out a friend of his got the same toy, and his broke too. Not very durable, fun while it lasts, and not dangerous."
3,"Please people, this CD is good, but do not overrate it","I heard this CD already a couple of times and it is good, but not a masterpiece. If you like Rhapsody and your looking for a similar sound, this is a good choice, but not expect Rhapsody's excellence. However, some songs in this CD are really captivating."
3,Too much Sheila E,"If they had simply made this movie about the emergence of rap as a true genre of music deserving its own respect, with a bit of Russell Simmon's life story mixed in, you would have had an all right film. Not great, but the performances would have made it worth while, a nice time capsule for mid80s rap. But someone either had a huge crush on Sheila E, or thought she was really going to be a huge star, and therefore shoved her in as many scenes as they could. She sings, she ""acts,"" she ""raps,"" and she's the love interest for two of the guys to sort of fight over. It's all boring and completely unnecessary. I was far more interested in the Fat Boys subplot than anything related to her."
2,Disappointing,"Basically just a venue for Russell Simmons to hype his label (Krush = Def; Groove = Jam) and the music is disappointing. Beastie Boys and LL Cool J get short shrift and Sheila E. gets major camera time, and even raps? The only really redeeming aspect of the film is that you get to see the Def Jam stable of artists from 15 years ago. Totally lacks the ... um ... style of ""Wild Style""."
2,It's Just Alright,"This movie was alright, but not something I'd like to watch again. Once is enough. I never knew Sheila E. had starred in ""Krush Groove"" and it was kind of weird hearing her rap and mingling with hip-hop artist. She really looked out of place. Other than that, this movie isn't anything to write home about."
4,History of Rap Music,"This is loosely based on the story of Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin, the boy wonders who founded Def Jam, a record company who roster boasted the best rap acts of the 1980's. It features several of the top rappers of that decade, including RUN DMC, Kool Moe Dee, The Fat Boys and a young LL Cool J (before he got that now buff body of his). Not the greatest film in terms of screenwriting and acting, but an excellent look into the 1980s rap scene."
5,Still Grooving...,"I first viewd this movie at the age of 14, It is enjoyable now as it was back then. Even better it is on DVD!!! Thanks for keeping the ""old skool"" hip hoppers grooving!"
3,pretty good,Blair Underwood does a good job in this film of the rise of The Music Mogul&Legend Russell Simmons.how Def Jam was formed.Kurtis BLow was cool.as much as i like her Shelia E. looks dinky in this film then&now.the Fat Boys were a trip.grubing hard.it's hit&miss through out.but it does represent a time period in Rap&HIp Hop.it's cool seeing Run Dmc&LL.Cool J back when.New Edition was out of place as well as Shelia.
3,Classic... sort of.,"This movie featured some of the best talent of the day, but the poor script and contrived plot bring it down a few notches. As an entertainment movie, it doesn't quite cut it; however, if you're a fan of the music, it really won't matter. Lots of fun, nonetheless."
3,Just Read This...,"This is definitely the worst movie ever, and I'm about to watch it again!!! If you can leave your common sense and civilized sensibilities behind, you WILL ENJOY THIS FLICK!!! Its sooo dumb it just makes you laugh... whatever, I'm just giving it a ""good"" review because I'm anonymous and my names Perry and my best friends name is Kevin....seriously, what are the odds?!?!?!?!"
3,"Good, but not as Great as the Player","Play by play type of book, rather than life anecdotes. You have to enjoy the history of baseball to enjoy this book. But if you do, then it will be very good reading. If you wish to understand the persona, read a short quip on the web about his great accomplishments."
2,A Good Intro book but not a GREAT one!,"Well, I must admit, this book has great photos regarding fishes but little on corals. They have talked little regarding the equipments set ups. They aren't many species included in this book but the common ones are there. If you are looking for a book with great pics on fishes, then this would be the one for you. If you are looking for a reef aquarium manual then this is not for you."
3,Beginners-Buy With Caution,"This is an good husbandry guide for fish, corals etc. For beginners, however, it lacks significant muscle. The aquarium setup instructions are questionable at best, often conflicting with most other experts in the field. The authors explanation of various types of equipment is paltry at best, and the author completely ignores the new standard in biological filtration (live rock and sand). Take it all with a grain of salt. Beginners, don't buy this as a setup guide. For that, look for books by Michael Paletta and Martin A. Moe Jr. Otherwise, this is a decent book for general husbandry and helpful for the selection of our animals."
4,Exelente Fuente de Conocimientos,"Excelente fuente de conocimeintos para los novatos en acuarios marinos, la infromacion es presentada de forma practica y entendible lo que nos ayuda a no cometer errores en el inicio de nuestro acuario marino."
3,Weird !,Pretty weird movie. Was nice Danny and Barry again after so many years. Bigfoot was pretty creepy. Have seen better Bigfoot movies.
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the first 45 minutes of this film. It made me interested enough to want to keep watching. It really starts falling apart though in the last half hour - it simply makes no sense. The scares come cheap (lots of lame ""boo"" moments) and the whole ghost angle is poorly conceived and not particularly compelling. It's a shame."
1,Chafes My Arse,"Girl (they never introduce themselves to each other -- ha ha, really clever) catches a ride to Delaware from Guy, off of a message board. Is Guy who he says he is? By the 45-minute point, I could give a crap. It was at this point that I realized I was stuck in THAT movie. You know, the one where all the clocks stop, and history keeps repeating itself. Where you relive experiences, and there are ghosts of tragedies past. How many times have I seen this movie? An absolute groaner of a film with zero surprises. I gave the movie the finger when it was over. Shame on George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh for getting me to reach into my wallet."
4,is it real,this was a great movie . started slow but yet it is one of those that you have to pay attention to . but as i was watching things looked real but were out of place . kept me at the edge because what is going to happen now
4,A really good movie,"This was a really good movie considering I had never heard of it, I saw George Clooney was an exec producer on it and decided to watch it. The actors were really good in it, and it is basically them, stuck in their car, in the middle of a long deserted highway, waiting for help as they are trapped inside by the evil being(s) waiting for them outside. Just one thing, could somebody please give Ashton Holmes a role where he is able to have some happiness, that would be great."
3,A mediocre horror flick,"Emily Blunt is a great actress, and it's a good thing since the acting is all this movie has going for it. The plot's nothing special; a guy and a girl (they don't have names?) find themselves being attacked by an evil spirit after their car gets stuck on a snowy road. Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for something shocking to happen, something to make this movie stand out from the rest. But it never came. This is just a typical ghost story, with better acting than most horror films. The character development between the guy and the girl is good, but it's for nothing since there's hardly a plot.Wind Chill is actually better and more entertaining than most horror movies you'd find these days, but that's not saying a lot. Rent this for a creepy hour and a half; you most likely won't want to watch it again."
1,Stinks on ice,"Can't believe this movie has so many average and high reviews. Sorry to say, there's just nothing to it, including scares. the first hour or so treats the viewer to interminable dialog between characters you don't even care to learn anything about followed by a bunch of hackneyed spookum drivel. Blech. I usually can find something to like about almost any movie, and enjoy many ""so bad it's good"" kind of films. But Wind Chill stole two hours of my life and gave me less than nothing in return. It's not scary, it's not interesting, it has nothing to hold it together and it's like scores of other faceless ""horror"" movies we've all seen. It COULD have been a decent 15-20 minute short, possibly, but stretched out to feature length? The emperor has no clothes...also no plot and no chills. I generally only review things that I find enjoyable. I'm going out of my way to review something I disliked a great deal to try to save you the time, money and energy you'd waste on this flop. Avoid."
2,BLUNT IS GREAT BUT MOVIE IS LAME,"What starts out as a great story gets sidetracked literally and figuratively after about 30 minutes. That's when all logic is thrown out the window and the ""ghosts"" start showing up and the rest of the movie tries to explain what's going on. Do we care? Not really, although it must be said Emily Blunt rises above the mundane screenplay with a performance worthy of a better film. She is a star in the making. The screenwriters need to experience real life and not merely reel life -- all their references are bits and pieces from better movies."
1,Surprise! No DVD in box.,"I very recently ordered and received from this site the DVD ""Wind Chill."" I just opened the sealed package to watch the movie -- and there was NO DVD IN THE BOX! I received an empty box! Needless to say, I am not a happy camper. What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product? That I could trust this website to provide the product I ordered! I expect this oversight to be corrected."
4,Cold as ice hit.,"Entertaining,an orginal story about this couple that get on a dead end experience,fighting for survival in a cold winter day,surrounded by unrest spirits of priests who witnessed crimes about a local dirty cop.Honestly,it is worth buying or renting,a direct to dvd movie which should have been on the theater.Enjoy."
3,About what I expected from it.,"This was a decent movie, it does drag in parts but it makes up with a decent story overview. If you like ghost story type movies, you'll probably like this one too."
2,dark and bad sound,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now. They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it. However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors. Also the sound is very bad. Some of the plots are a little boring. But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality. I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't. I just wish it was easier to watch."
5,Superb Cooking & Baking,Donna Hay is brilliant. This book has easy to follow recipes and they work. Can't ask for more than that.
4,Exactly What We Want!,"We have bought this item in Singapore for our child and we realized that his health has improved tremendously. His resistance to the common cold is much better and does not have to rely on antibiotics. Since the item is produced in USA, we thought we might as well buy from its original source. Bingo... it was exactly what we have and want! Thanks and we will continue to order more."
2,"Beware, sweetner!","The product description for this item said no sweeteners, that was the primary reason I went with this brand. Beware, fructose is the second listed ingredient! It's super sweet tasting, too sweet really. My kids love it and I'm going to use the whole bottle, but I'll be buying an actual sugar-free vitamin-C next time."
1,Horrible,Let me say that I'm not by any means a newbie to the subject.I'm an Environmental Studies major and I've read tons of geology books already and let me tell you:this one is by far the WORST.There's not a clear explanation for anything throughout the book.You will feel so lost you'll end up hating this book like me-_________-
3,Catchy tunes with two star turns.,"Chita Rivera and Nancy Dussault are the stars of this show. The score isn't wonderful, but there are plenty of tunes to keep you humming. Two songs, ""Mean"" and ""I Can,"" demonstrate why Ms Rivera has been a plus for any musical production"
4,A very nice score.,"The CD of Bajour is the perfect example of a ""nice"" Broadway show: Plesant score with a few nice songs such as ""Words, Words, Words"" and ""Where is the Tribe for Me"", but nothing groundbreaking or remarkable about it. Great performance by Chita Rivera, Nancy Dussault and, Herschel Bernardi also help. A good CD for Broadway fans."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"How bad is it,they ask. Not as bad as you'd think; though ""Bajour"" has bland,and even horrid aspects,it's still good often enough to remind you why its stars are so highly admired. Good orchestra.If you were wondering,you may as well give it a go.Songwriter Walter Marks had the chops, and showed them again a few years laterin the wildly tacky, glossy-professional ""Golden Rainbow""(""I've Gotta Be Me""). Whatever happened to him?Anyway,you'll laugh at least sometimes during ""Bajour"" -- it's got glee,that's for sure."
4,still delightful,"We had seen the previous four eagerly, but had been told they didn't stay as good following Series Four. We disagree and enjoy the stories, characters, interaction, and human truths. We will probably try the Series Six."
2,disappointed by socialist agenda,"I liked the series, but the way they developed it over the years it clearly began to turn it into a tool for socialist propaganda. It becamae more and more annoying."
4,"Monarch of The Glen, series 5",This series isn't bad but series 6 and 7 fell apart as far as I'm concerned.
2,Some question of integrity on this CD,"The earlier reviewer rated this 5 star, but I can only give it 2, because the first selection, ""Intermezzo"",doesn't sound like Hines and is more classical and ""Dark Eyes"" features a violin. The best sides are clearly those with Muggsy Spanier,but they're only the last five of the CD. There are better CDs, featuring both Muggsy and Earl ""Fatha"" Hines."
2,Simply sophisticated yet unique,"Unlike the fun but trendy faceplates this earth theme color has a distinctive look that also compliments any style. Because it is in neutral tones, you won't soon tire of it. The color has sheen to it that makes the color appear a different hue in different lighting. The dark undertones keep the phone looking new and clean unlike some of the lighter or laquer looking finishes that show every smudge and fingerprint. I often recieve compliments on the phone when among company. If you're looking for a fun change or different look but don't want to lock your phone into a novelty or bubble-gum look, the earth theme is a perfect choice!"
5,A must have in Organizational Communication,"Dr. Zaremba has written a book that truly explains Organizational Communication. This book will not only aid the reader in understanding what Organizational Communication is, but has the potential to make the reader a better manager and worker.As a student of Organizational Communication I would reccommend this book to anyone studing or even interested in learning more."
1,fails to address question on cover,"Cover question is: ""Is ours the only inhabited planet?"" This short book of 154 pages walks through numerous necessities for life to exist - as we know it here on earth. Sir Harold Spencer Jones at the end of the book - literally the last paragraph -merely dismisses that he is qualified to speculate whether or not life exists elsewhere in the universe."
3,Math as a Language,"This book looks at learning math as the same process as learning any language. The words have meaning that varies within the context of the math. As a math teacher, it gave me a new perspective on the use of symbols and vocabulary when teaching math.I found the first chapter the most valuable. Lateer there is a good graphical explaination of complex (imaginary) numbers that was a major a-ha!"
1,A really dumb book,"Probably one of the poorest written books I have ever attempted to read. The author repeats things over and over to gain word content, but says very little of substance."
2,very breezy,"It's nice to read a book on a potentially technical subject that is written in a more colloquial manner. The author of this book has taken that too far, though. The book is interesting in places and seems at least somewhat well researched, but the style is simply too cute, and distracts the reader with irrelevant (often autobiographical) side stories that seem to be written for people who would rather not be reading a book on this topic in the first place. I would like to think that, buried in her writing, there must be a pony somewhere, but I don't think it's worth the trouble of digging it up."
3,raw vol III,"It was all right, just the high points of the year, mostly what you would expect to see, only complaint was too much hHh and not enough jericho! and as far as that last guy goes, I still buy VHSand am proud to say so!"
1,Not the same,"I HOPE THIS ISN'T THE SAME AS THE OTHER BEST OF RAW'S. NUMBER 1 AND NUMBER 2 WERE PRACTICALY IDENTICAL. I FELT CHEATED BY THE WWF THAT THEY WOULD SELL THE SAME VIDEO UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES.Also I would like to add that now that Stone Cold is too old, The Rock vs. RVD would be the dream match we would all love to see"
1,Did Not Download to Tivo!,"I rented this movie but when it downloaded all that downloaded was the preview. I was charged for the actual movie.So, be careful if you want to watch this! I'm hoping Amazon fixes it! I've contacted Support but I wanted to warn people."
4,Gere Hits Again,"Richard Gere has had two really good movie this past year. One was The Hoax, which I recommend and the other, this movie, The Hunting Party. The subject is really interesting and the acting was very good too. I enjoyed every bit of this movie. It also has many funny moments in it though it is a very intense and serious subject.I recommend it to everybody."
3,Keep Hunting..,"Whether or not events in the movie were based on some actual facts, the story comes off very unconvincingly, it smacks of Hollywood and finally falls just short of being entertaining. It does nothing toward educating audiences on root causes of the war, of which many people are completely oblivious - not that that was the point of the film, but with good guys and bad guys in such perfect black and white, you might as well have been watching a Chuck Norris film. Except in a Chuck Norris film you'd be more likely to believe all the utterly nonsensical events leading up to the heroes eventual victory. This is a pretty tepid movie, and whether or not based on actual events, was hard to take seriously."
3,THE HUNTING PARTY,"GOOD THO NOT GREAT FILM ABOUT A NEWS HOUND AND HIS ADRENILINE JUNKY CAMERAMAN GETTING PERSONALLY CAUGHT UP IN THE HORRORS OF THE SERB BOSNIAN CONFLICT AFTER THE BREAK UP OF THE ONCE RULING COMMUNIST REGIME. AGAIN, DOESN'T ADDRESS THE CENTURYS OF HATE AND ANIMOSITY UNDERLYING THE EXPLOSION INTO BARBARISM. SOLID PERFORMANCES BY GERE AND HOWARD."
5,Marsland is the real deal,"While novices are probably better advised to start with Adam's ""You Don't Know Me"" solo platter or his Cockeyed Ghost apotheosis ""Ludlow 6:18,"" this account of his marathon one-man tour of the States offers an unadulterated, uncut blast of one of pop music's best-ever writers and performers.The songcraft is uncommonly good, the performances are saucy and heartfelt, and the overall vibe is so pulsatingly vibrant that it's hard to believe that just one person is responsible. And the added treat to all of this splendor is a studio version of the unforgettable ""Portland."""
5,"If a Zen poem could be a comic book, this would be it","This is probably the best comic book I've ever read. In I Never Liked You, Chester Brown recounts his own adolescence. He doesn't rely on quirks, self-pity, overanalysis, or an edgy drawing style. His work is simple and understated, one incident flowing into another in an apparent anecdotal fashion which, by the end, reveals a large picture of Brown's seemingly hidden feelings. It is his relationship with his mentally unstable mother that fuels this book; Brown thoughtlessly antagonizes her (as teenagers do) and struggles with his inability to say ""I love you""--at least to the right people at the right time. In his youth, Brown was best able to express himself through symbolic drawings which he infused with meanings he would later claim weren't there (""I never use symbolism."") This grown-up effort seems an extension of that, as a bittersweet memoir and perhaps explanation/closure for his emotional distance."
3,"Okay, but not superb","Typical adolescent angst. Accurate but nothing unusual, just normal insecurities and confusions of adolescence. No great insights, but well-written and the drawings are very evocative. Details the pain and heartbreak of teen love and rebellion."
2,Tis Overrated,"I love self autobio's done in comic book fashion.....But, this one tends to go nowhere from the beganing to the end. One is left scratching their head wondering why Chester Brown wrote this? The basic plot that goes nowhere is that Chester is bugged by a group of bullies who want him to say the F word and S word. Some skinny chick really digs him but, cause of that age he says he loves the girl with big boobs. As a side plot that over all had mabye 6 pages dedicated to it his mom dies......It's a very fast read cause theres nothing to look at or read....Just terrible. After reading some of his work in American Splender this was just a big disapointment. If you have to fill your comic auto bio look somewhere else this one will leave you really hungry...."
4,Perugina Candy Review,Product just as good as I remembered. Am so glad to have found a source to obtain it.Recommend to anyone who likes special mint candies.
1,"""NOT"" Corelle","These mugs are ""NOT"" Corelle. They are Corelle Coordinates. They are heavy. Hope they won't break like the porcelain they are.I was very unhappy with the mugs."
4,Love these mugs!!,"These mugs are just wonderful for everyday use. I own these corelle mugs since the last two years and not a day has passed when i haven't used them. They haven't lost their shine with time (I compared them to a new set I recently bought and they look the same). They are a little heavy but at this price, its worth it. Would recommend for everyday use."
3,Pretty Far Out Stuff,"This is very experimental Chick Corea stuff. Interesting to listen to. Recording quality is good. If you're curious, give it a purchase. Far out fusion piano stuff."
5,I'm with the 5 star guys.,"What can I add; the first project was a pair of large cabinet doors. I made them dead flush, quickly, and probably the best doors I have made. I'm 4 square with the 5 star guys."
1,A special book,"If you're looking for a book that is creepy and horrendously dull, this book is for you."
1,OOOOO Pleeeeeeeeze!!!,"I had heard the book was good, and I was sickened with it when I read it. The author gets quite melodramatic with his story. (Of course, I may be slightly biased, as I had the grave misfortune to have worked indirectly for the author shortly after the book was published. I seem to remember the author not treating people nearly as well as he apparently treated his dog.) I found the book to be a lot of whining from a man who became unusually attached to a dog; probably one of the few living creatures he couldn't offend. I finished the book thinking ""Sheesh...get over it already, Martin."""
5,Gives you more appreciate to any pet/human you'll love,"After losing my Doberman, a fellow animal lover suggested the book to me. I was reluctant but finally did. I couldn't put it down, read it in one night. Cried my eyes out but in the end, the book helped me to remember the wonderful antics of my dog, good or bad, and I gained even more appreciation for having her in my life. Since then, I've lost other pets; dogs, cats, horses, rats -- during our time together, I learned to see all of their unique qualities and understand their behavior better, BEFORE they pass. I cherish this book. The author is very intune to 'life' and helped me to appreciate the gifts we are given."
5,Maya's First Rose,A wonderful book! I have read this over and over and I cry every time! The true nature of a very special love and how animals enrich our lives.
1,WRONG PICTURE!!!,"Ok, this switch is not the switch in the picture. I needed something that was a little higher than the backing I was mounting it on, and the picture shows that. Instead I got something that is useless to me. I could't find a way to directly contact the seller, so I am voicing my frustrations on here. Like many people building a project, everything is kind of important, this just won't work."
3,great idea/some problems,"I love it when it is working right. I waste a lot of tape getting it loaded and if you do not use just the right touch, you waste tape. When I can get on a roll with it, IT IS WONDERFUL. If it doesn't roll right, I have to peel the sticky off and glob it on manually. I do not recommend for small projects, large pojects are so much better."
2,Sadness and Porno,"I'm always searching to addto my Asian horror movie collectionand the reviews led me to believethat this would be a good one to add.I will offer a rebuttal to100% positive reviews(as of this writing).I do agree that the plotis interesting.Definitely worthy ofexamination and discussion.Some of the imagery was quitegood, but not great.The opening shot held muchpromise, but that was thebest there was.This film was unrelentinglymelancholic.The music, the cinematography,the characters, the images...across the boardand it included three scenesof soft core sexual pornography.The film-maker kept most ofthe violence off-screen.That worked as it usually does.Why not the sex?That usually works also.To flesh out the non-linearplot and find some of thedeeper themes, if any,I would need to see themovie again,but I don't want to.It's depressing."
5,Quality of Collection,"There are 5 CDs that make up the complete collection. I have all 5, but I'll use this one to say that the entire set is a superb representation of Joplin's music."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book for someone considering the idea of building an airplane. The first part really helps the reader get past the fantasy part of building and owning a plane and think about the reality behind what it takes to build, operate, maintain, store, and insure a home built airplane. Really helped me contemplate the question: Is this something that is really for me? The second part is an overview of construction techniques that presents the basic skills of each method. The information is very useful and helps steer the potential builder towards a desired construction type. Overall, I agree with many reviewers that this book is a highly recommended read for anyone who plans to get into home built aircraft."
4,Awesome!,"This is a great book for anyone considering building their own airplane, it goes into great detail about every facet of building your own plane, and excellent book!"
2,Crockpots will be crockpots,"Because this cookbook got such great reviews, I recently bought it. I am an experienced, fairly adventerous cook and I cook dinner every night. After a week of Donna Marie's recipes my family is begging me to quit. I made Black Bean Cassoulet soup (thin and watery), Moussaka, Morrocan Vegetable Hotpot (hot?), Drunken Roast chicken (falling apart, drunken), and No Fuss Chicken Stock. The last one is the only one I'll bother to repeat. The others were edible, but totally boring and overcooked by the time I got home, even though I followed the cooking recommendations (I even read the intro). I was hoping against hope that this book would allow me to come home to wonderful meals. One thing I can say is that the food I cooked was probably very healthy. It had that home-economist obviously-good-for-you taste. I haven't tried any desserts yet. The steamed puddings might be okay. The world is still waiting for the Julia Child of crockpots."
3,The Jury is Out,"I recently got this book because it seemed like an excellent starting point for my new slow cooker. While the intro gave me some spot-on advice about the art of slow-cooking, I find the recipes seem to have been a bit neglected by the author. I made the Burgundy Beef with Wild Mushrooms, and although it turned out reasonably well, it was only because I altered the ingredient quantities when the stated amounts were obviously wrong. It was painfully apparent that this recipe had NOT been tested prior to publication. I think this book could be useful to the seasoned cook who will be able to see when the recipe is noticeably unbalanced, but it might cause some heartache for the less experienced cook who will surely end up make some very unappetizing dishes through no fault of their own. I'll try a few more recipes, and update this review accordingly."
1,Disappointment,"The recipes sound great, but I tried two and they were both awful. The blend of flavors and consistency were both lacking. Word of advice: try the recipes before using them for guests."
4,"So far, so good","I just bought this book and have only tried one recipe called something like ""Football Day Chili"". It was the best chili I've ever had, so hopefully some of the other recipes will be just as good. I only gave 4 stars because I did make some miner tweaks to the recipe that seemed to contribute to its overall success (used 2 T oil when browning the beef, added 2 cloves garlic to recipe)."
5,I love this cookbook!,"I've been using this cookbook for year's and love it. I haven't found the difficulties other readers indicated. Some recipes I like more than others, but overall it is hands-down my favorite slow cooker cookbook.I bought it originally for the Chicken and Dumplings, as I was searching for a great recipe. I used a mortar and pestle to grind the rosemary to put in the dumplings and other than that, really didn't modify it.Our favorites that are repeated often:Thai Chicken thighs - if I'm out of cilantro, I use coriander and add parsley. I also use only natural peanut butter so it's more nutty.Chicken and Rosemary DumplingsHoney Glazed Country RibsPotato Leek soup with StiltonHot Buttered RumPecan Wild RiceCheesy MeatloafPlum Good ChickenI recommend this book to all my friends with slow cookers."
5,Over a hundred recipes for slow cooker dishes,"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes presents over a hundred recipes for slow cooker dishes ranging from appetizers to desserts, beverages to finger foods. Meatloafs to casseroles, pasta bakes to plum chicken: this goes beyond the soup and stew orientation of competing titles to provide a wide range of options for crock pot cooks."
5,Very Heplfull for my busy lifestyle.,This book of ideas helps me to get great meals easily. I can leave the cooker on all day with inexpensive cuts and have great results.Love the book!
4,A rarity these days.,"Barbara Bonney and Harnoncourt collaborated largely in this collection of sacred songs sung and recorded over a span of 6 years from 1989 to 1995.Bonney owns a very affecting and lyrical voice, reminiscent of the late queen of sopranos Lucia Popp at certain places. The voice is ideally suited to the pieces collected in this album.A great shame that not the entire piece of Bach's BWV 199 cantata was being recorded - I have heard the earlier collaboration by Schwarzkopff and Dart with the Philharmonia Orchestra recorded some several decades ago, and the entire work is miraculously beautiful. There are recitatives and the third part has a longer opening recitative between the viola and soprano voice that is simply stunning.Otherwise, the other works in this collection are all wonderful. Bonney in 1990 - 1995 is recognisably in her absolute vocal prime."
3,Amusing but definetly offbeat.,"I heard about this movie a few years ago from a friend. What mainly interested me was that it was based on a novel by Irvine Welsh who also wrote Trainspotting. I loved the movie Trainspotting and so i decided to watch this, hoping it would be similar. It's really not. The film has its moments, but the camera work and the editing make parts of it very choppy. The story is not one story, but three and there is only a loose connection between them. It doesn't have near the drug content (or the drug related humor) that Trainspotting did. If you're a fan of Welsh's books then this may be worth watching, but if you're looking for another humorous take on drug addiction in Scotland, this is not Trainspotting 2."
5,Mark,"This product, is great, i mean its just a faceplate, but it really looks shinny and new. When i got it it just made my phone stand out. :)"
5,Solid Stage Light,"I was unable to find this at any music stores locally, as I was told it was discontinued in lieu of a newer version. Shipping was fast, and the light was quality!"
4,Sometimes stunning,Sometimes stunning and often frustrating. Probably a great deal is lost in translation but the opening is pure brilliance.
2,"If you're watching this for the plot, don't waste your time...","This is an awful movie. No plot, terrible acting (even by Ms. Bullock, who is one of my favorite actors), and even bad lighting and camera angles on the one scene you're probably getting this movie to see. The two stars are simply because this is the first and probably only film in which Sandra is actually buck naked-- not that you can really see anything of substance, but it's a novelty when an A-lister like Sandra takes it all off. If owning her one and only skin flick is your goal, buy it. Otherwise, just admire her beauty fully clothed in one of her good movies."
1,A complete waste of time,"The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it is only 78 minutes long. I was inspired to rent it after the morning TV news reported it's release and how Sandra Bullock allegedly tried to block it because of a nude scene. Well, I would say she tried to block its release because it is so embarassingly awful. I have seen better student films. The dialog is so bad at times it makes you laugh. The male lead (a photo journalist) take so many pictures of everything it is comical right out of a Saturday Night Live skit. He even holds out his camera to take a picture of himself while he is being held in a choke hold with a knife to his throat. As for the nude scene, it is just a series of headshots and hair flips barely enough to justify an R rating (no T&A). The plot is so weak it makes you wonder how they are going to end it as you check your watch to see how much time is left. Don't waste your time with this one..."
2,Not like the other Bullock movies,"This movie was somewhat of a disappointment. From watching it, I really thought it was an older movie not one that was recently released. The story didn't catch my interest. The plot was developed enough and the quality of the film was poor.I watched it mainly because of Sandra Bullock, I've loved all her films so far, but this one is nothing like any of her others. I wonder what made her do it. It is so unlike her and the movie surely didn't measure up to her usual standard.I definitely didn't think it was a worthy film and I didn't even get through most of it. It just wasn't gripping enough to keep me watching to the end."
3,"Not bad, surpising for Bullock, Sheffer.","This movie wasn't bad, not great, but not bad, as Bullock and Sheffer are known for lighter weight roles. She was an environmentalist and he a journalist, trying to stop the destruction of the rainforests. The ""love"" scene was limited, but I had an ""R"" copy, don't know if the unrated has more or not, but probably ""cropped"" to fit tv. [Also, what's up with the ""nipple"" taping for Bullock, according to Craig Hosada's ""Bare Facts"" guide.] I agree with some reviews that Sheffer was obnoxious and Bullock was ok, and this movie's one scene is about as revealing as she's ever likely to get, but it was ok. I only paid about $5.00, so, I don't think I got ""cheated""."
1,THIS IS SANDRA'S WORST MISTAKE EVER!,"I rented this movie becuase I thought it would be interesting just because Sandra Bullock was in it. I am so happy that I onlty spent 3 bucks on it becuase the movie is a waste of time. I fast forwarded throughout the whole thing and still didn't get to the end. It dragged on and on, the acting seemed poor (even sandra's) which really surprised me. The quality of the film was low and that wouldn't have made a difference if there was a good plot line. I was so dissapointed and coulnd't belive this was a Sandra Bullock movie. I also couldn't believe that she was nude in the film. After having the girl next door image for so long, I couldn't believe the sex scene. It showed her having sex from behind. Sandra! That's probably the only thing that may persuade you to buy it, but other than that this is the worst film i have seen in a long long time. I cannot emphasize that enough. I rented Frequency too, and that one is a good buy or rental."
3,Better than average for a low budget film!,"The most interesting aspect is seeing Sandra Bullock early in her career, and of course the much hyped love scene with Craig Sheffer. (This scene is of course what is driving sales of the DVD) The scene tries to be tasteful, and for the most part is, but lacks the sexual energy of say ""The Thomas Crown Affair"". Ms Bullock still deserves alot of credit for trying to add some class to the film, and showcased early signs of her career to come. Other interesting aspect of the film included Character actor Juan Fernandez, a case of going ""I know I have seen him someplace before""), and the cinematography what is actaully quite good."
1,For Fans of Sandra,"I think that Fire on the Amazon is a very poor movie, but manages to mantain some interest in its plotline. It was produced in Peru amazonia by Roger Corman and directed by peruvian film maker Luis Llosa (in fact, cousin of writer Mario Vargas Llosa). For me, the main interest in the film is the presence of a very young Sandra Bullock, who performs her only one nude scene. It is a ""must see"" for every fan of hers."
2,Sandra Bullock movie,"I really like Sandra Bullock as an actress, but this is not one of her best. It is OK, but you might want to rent it once before you decide to buy it for your collection."
2,A Dubious Debut,"In this painfully earnest, yet mildly cheesy film, we see glimpses of Sandra Bullock's strong personality to come. However, she is mostly overshadowed by the overacting of the others involved, as well as the film's simplistic, bludgeon-you-over-the head political messages (i.e., ""Indians good; multinational logging corporations bad""). Ms. Bullock is pretty decent, but otherwise there's not much subtlety here."
1,Unrated? Looks like I got scamed,"I purchased the unrated version of this movie, only to find an R rated disc inside the unrated case. The movie was 78 minutes, and from what I've heard rumored on IMDB the unrated ver. is supposed to be 84 min.I don't know what 6 minutes they cut out, but the movie is so poor, it's not worth searching after."
1,CORMAN PLUS BULLOCK?,"It is a miracle Sandra Bullock got any work after this film at all. She was absolutely lousy with some of the worse lines imaginable. Craig Sheffer plays an obnoxious reporter who has his camera in everyone's face while Bullock is an activist attempting to save the rain forest. One of the protest leaders is killed and the story becomes a very bad who-dun-it. I kept hoping for Sheffer to die, but alas that was not the case. The sole attraction of this film is the love scene between Bullock and Sheffer where she shows more skin than usual, with strategic spots missing the camera so as to not technically classify it (in my book) as a nude scene per se. It is a bad ecology film, lousy drama, and worse murder mystery. Heck, it is not even good soft core. This is for die hard Bullock fans or Bullock stalkers. Avoid Avoid Avoid."
1,The Movie that should NEVER have been made.,"From 1991 but clearly released only to exploit Sandra Bullock 's current popularity. A poorly written script, un-sympathetic characters, and run-of-the-mill plot. The much heralded sex scene is probably interesting if you don't get out much and was obviously included in a shameless attempt to gain viewers. Make no mistake, Bullock handles her role, such as it is, with absolute professionalism. No actor can save a bad script. The films one redeeming feature (in theory) is that it is only 78 minutes in length. However these are 78 very L_O_N_G minutes. On the upside though this movie can be successfully watched in fast-forward mode with no damage what so ever done to the plot. Honestly, avoid this one -you'll feel stung anyway. There are many very compelling films on this subject, and Bullock has made many excellent films. This one is bad."
3,Sandra makes it worth viewing,"Well, the movie is NOT one of here best, (28 Days is). But the charisma and charm of Sandra make it worth your time to buy and watch. It is not a long movie, not a good movie, but a Sandra Bullock movie, which makes all the difference!"
1,Pathetic,The depiction of the photojournalist in this movie is a complete joke. Characters and their motivations were poorly established and the cinematography and direction seemed cheap and amateurish.
2,"If you're buying this for the plot, don't bother...","This is an awful movie. No plot, terrible acting (even by Ms. Bullock, who is one of my favorite actors), and even bad lighting and camera angles on the one scene you're probably getting this movie to see. The two stars are simply because this is the first and probably only film in which Sandra is actually buck naked-- not that you can really see anything of substance, but it's a novelty when an A-lister like Sandra takes it all off. If owning her one and only skin flick is your goal, buy it. Otherwise, just admire her beauty fully clothed in one of her good movies."
2,Waste Of Your Time,I bought the unrated version of this movie from amazon it was only 78 minutes and was the same as the R version. Don't buy this movie. If you want to see it go rent it from your Local Video Store. This movie was the biggest waste of my time and money.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"First and foremost, let me state that Sandra Bullock is my absolute favorite and this review is not a reflection of her. This movie is below disappointment. There is almost no plot. The production is poor (i.e. non-continuous cuts, actual cut outs of audio effects, stereo effects reversed! (Unbelievable)) It is only seventy some minutes long but seems like hours. As for you voyeurs wanting an 'unrated' version, forget it. There is more 'unrated' in the first thirty seconds of most other movies than in this entire movie (which I am extremely pleased with, Sandra Bullock is above that kind of perversion). If you want a movie, get Air Force One. If you want a glimpse, get Eyes Wide Shut. I heard that the release of this movie was almost blocked by one of its members due to its poor plot/production. It is easy to see why. Do not waste your time or money on this one. Again, it is very important that you understand that this review reflects the movie and not Sandra Bullock."
2,Not much here,"Aside from die hard Sandra Bullock fans, most people won't find much here of interest. A cheesy environmental type story set in the South American rain forest, it finds her as an activist caught in the middle of Native violence and shooting soft core porno with some journalist guy (Craig Sheffer). Sandra plays her role well....unfortunately it's just not a good role. Pass this one bye."
4,Great intro to Old Testament,"I bought this book for a college course, and wound up keeping it. Of course it's not unusual for me to keep textbooks--but I'm an accounting and finance major. This is the only non-business textbook that I have ever kept.As was pointed out before, this is not an encyclopedia on Old Testament times, but it is the best primer/overview that I have ever seen, and I think that it would be a great starting point for anyone who wants to gain a good understanding of the life and times of the ancient Jews."
2,RE: Where is Jackie?,Jackie Chan is the director of this movie. He is not in the movie himself. Please be aware of this.
2,Yen Shi-kwan barely makes this horrible movie worth watching,"The story is not worth going over. This is easily one of the most boring kung fu movies ever. One of the best kickers in cinema history Tony Leung Siu Hung stars as a young man who is trying to learn kung fu. The fights are pretty good, but there is not nearly enough of them. Fung Hak-on has a good cameo using a chain rope, and Lau Ga-yung from 'Dragon Claws' does some decent work. The best part about this movie is the final fight with Yen Shi-kwan. It goes on for well over 10 minutes but barely manages to save this horrible movie.1.5/5The version I have is from Groundzero and has watchable picture quality. It is under the title 'The Master and the Boxer'. Included on the disc are bonus clips from other Groundzero movies and some cool lost IFD trailers."
1,IT'S A TRICK! JACKIE CHAN IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE!,"THIS MOVIE IS A SERIOUS LETDOWN. IN ORDER TO AVENGE HIS FATHER'S MURDER, A YOUNG MAN LEARNS MARTIAL ARTS. EXTREMELY CORNY AND BAD. JACKIE MAY HAVE DIRECTED THIS TRASH AND HE EVEN WAS THE MARTIAL ARTS DIRECTOR, BUT HE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THIS FILM, DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS PICTURE IS ON THE COVER! THE FINAL FIGHT IS OK, BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS BULLSH-T. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A REAL JACKIE CHAN MOVIE FROM THE EARLIER DAYS OF HIS CAREER, RENT OR BUY ''THE YOUNG MASTER'' OR ''POLICE STORY''."
1,A waste of money for Jackie Chan fans,"Jackie Chan has a cameo role.print is poor and the dubbing awful.the DVD however contains good add on features like a trivia game and a DVD dictionary giving details on dvd features, etc.good buy only for the dictionary."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is NOT a Jackie Chan movie! Well, ok, he did work on it, but only as the stunt coordinator. The producers put together a ""making of"" documentary, then later unscrupulously edited in behind-the-scenes footage of Jackie. Why? For money, of course. The original didn't do well; the re-edited version was marketed as a Jackie Chan movie. According to Jackie, he was furious about it, but there was little he could do at the time."
1,where is jackie?,"jackie himself is not featuring in this movie!he is supposed to be some sort of fighting coordinator, but i dont believe crap of it.the story stinks and is very thin and simple.fighting is ok."
2,Not a Jackie Chan Film!!!,"Do not believe the cover of the movie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie. You see him in a behind the scenes bit in the beginning, but that's it. As far as the movie itself, I've only seen it once and it wasn't good enough for me to not get so easily distracted from it. I can't really remember too much about it anymore. Not memorable."
4,Memories of a Great Childhood,"My wife and I spent 27 years growing up in Leominster. We now have also lived 27 years of our lives away from Leominster although we go back pretty regular. We found this book to be very enjoyable as a walk down memory lane. We found many photos of people we know/knew (including us in the 63/64 High School prom photo), our churchs, schools and photos from the 50's & 60's that we remember so well. We are having a ball showing our children and grandchildren sights and people from where we grew up, where our families came from and from where many still live. A very well put together photo book which we highly recommed. Our sincere Thanks! to the writers and publisher."
4,Jesus' Son,"Denis Johnson writes like a sharpened razor. It feel good as long as it's running smooth and gives you a gentle babyface. But, once in a while he slips and slits your throat just enough so you want to get off the chair from the bleeding, but your neck is shackled and you can't get up. Any second he'll rip your artery. Your are frozen and mesmerized."
4,"Fast, intense read.","Jesus' son is a very short collection of short stories that should take the average reader no time to get through. It is great in two ways. First, it is very effective in demonstrating the lost and agitated mindset of a drug-addicted lovable loser bumbling his way through the '70's. Second, Johnson's writing manages to be somehow both florid and lean, with exactly the right details magnified for effect. A quick, but engrossing read, Jesus' Son could be a 5-star book, but it's too short."
4,"Generally brilliant, if slightly imperfect.","A loosely connected collection of stories about a drugged-out low-life and his buddies, ""Jesus' Son"" is not the kind of book I usually read myself to sleep with... but I can't deny that the author is enormously talented. The stories seem random and fragmented, but they do manage to add up to a coherent whole, and this elliptical quality, I think, largely accounts for the book's power. Johnson manages to say a lot about the strange mystery of life in these pages, where comedy and tragedy frequently collide, lightning can strike anyone at any moment, and even the doomed can be saved.Even so, the author sometimes strains too hard with his prose, which can be pretentiously ""poetic."" The stories are also a tad uneven in quality. Still, I'd recommend this book to any serious reader of fiction."
2,A downer,"This book was recommended by Junot Diaz. I suppose a trained writer might appreciate it. It is essentially a drug version of ""Those Drinking Days"""
3,"not ""like new""","Overall I was pleased with this purchase in all aspects except one. I thought I was buying a book in ""like new"" condition meaning it might have a couple bent corners or other minor flaws caused by rough handling. What I received was slightly batter, has pages yellowed with age, smells like it's been on a back corner shelf for too long, and even had a couple small spider webs clinging to the pages. I'm not too bothered since these are still cosmetic flaws and I bought the book to read, not to look at, but next time I hope they list the condition as something more appropriate, maybe ""like old""."
4,Intangibly felt,"I can't pin down what it is about Johnson's writing style that I find so compelling, but I get the same rush of witness-to-genius from his material that I get from Vonnegut. Very simple sentences weave in and out of a drug-induced haze of short stories. My first foray into his work, but definitely not my last."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"It seems to me that the more ugly, grotesque, and hopeless your work is, the more people will praise you, call you a genius, and hand over their money to you. Denis Johnson is no exception here. Even though he can put a good line together once in a while, the praise surrounding his work is a lot of overblown hype and his stories lack any depth. I was attracted to this book because I'd read that Johnson was similiar to Thom Jones but is nowhere close to Jones's work. The ""dark side"" of life is only interesting for so long, and only if there's some meaning behind it, even though the privleged middle class seems to be obsessed with probing the depths of this from their secure suburban lifestyles. Isn't there enough disposable literature out there today?"
1,Lost in A Drug-like World,"This was seen on a recommended list by a somewhat famous author. I was sadly disappointed. The book had a number of short stories of which NONE inspired me. One of the stories mentions how one can't just sit on the bus as 'you've got to have a destination'. It's too bad the author of this book had no true destination. I was simply lost in nonsense. Don't give this your time--it's a waste of time. I felt the same way the author did on the last page of the book when he wrote 'Sometimes I heard voices muttering in my head, and a lot of the time the world seemed to smolder around its edges'. That's for sure...what a shame."
3,Wasn't thrilled but couldn't put it down?,"While the stories are jagged and hard to follow, there's something in the writing that makes you keep reading. The descriptions are very well done. You can't logically figure out what they're saying but from the sound of them you often know what they mean."
1,Not Hunter S Thompson,"The high ratings given this book by other reviewers is more a reflection of our adoration of addicts than of the quality of the writing.Huh? Consider how often Larry King guests a 'star' fresh from rehab. Frankly, we give losers too much attention and give far too little credit to those who make good life choices. Jesus' Son is a case in point. Or rather, lack of point.Let's get to Hunter S. Thompson. He will take you through a drug experience with a purpose---even in his least lucid moments he was most lucid.Skip this book, save the time and trouble. Read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And, if you really want quality introspection, read Camus' The Stranger."
2,Just Not Sure,"I tried to like this collection, and there were moments, some pretty dog-gone good ones, but there were other moments, lots of them, where I wanted to wing the book across the room and say, ""You're kidding me! This is the stuff that has folks yakking for ten years now?"" There's a lot of the stuff of the novice writer in here, pages and pages of it... In a literary sense, the book remeinds me of a kid who comes down a Sunday morning to the stale remnants of his parents' wild party and smokes a pretzel and sips flat ginger ale while dealing himself a hand. I mean, don't we have any adults writing?I don't think I have ever been as convinced that Am. Lit. is in need of a new voice, a new sensibility. I think the spareness that so many write about in praising Mr. Johnson comes from his gut instinct that he has nothing to add.By the way -- I read 'Tree of Smoke,' tried to read it, but found it not only unbearable, but false. 'Jesus' Son,' at least, is not false."
4,Johnson honing his skills,"his skills at creating lowlife, criminal characters with very little to no interior monologue, mostly through dialogue and action-observation that is (think of an author-Tarantino, though with more imaginative depth and poetry).I'd prefer Angels or Already Dead to this one a billion times, but it's still a striking stark gem of a short story collection."
4,laughing and thinking,Nearly every one of these stories made me laugh and in the midst of that laughter I had to pause and think about some sadness or profound thought that Johnson had seeded. I really enjoyed reading his stories and I think I will have to read this again to grasp a more full understanding.
5,Perfect!,"The last person I recomended this book stole five copies so he could give them away. I've read it at least 50 times. If you write, if you read, if you've made mistakes, you will like this book."
5,great book,This book is one of the finest collections of short stories published in the second half of the 20th century
3,its O.K.,"Paranoia..the reason i picked up this book was because Jensen and I had something in common - we both had Psychosis. Although many have different episodes, experiences, but some similarities - Jensen's autobiographical portrayal of himself is quite witty. The book doesnt merely explain in details how his mind gets tangled up in his first book that he published - i mean- i guess you have to buy his first book -""SHIVA 3000""...but i wouldnt, this book was enough for me."
3,"Ok, cheesy plastic","Item was okay - worked and was as pictured. Just take a close look at the picture, and realize that when you get them they are 100% thin plastic and look pretty cheesy up close, but that can be okay as long as you know it up front."
4,Little Hummers,This string of hummingbird lights is actually a string of white mini Christmas lights that fit individually into plastic hummingbird covers which in a way is good as you could replace the light string when it eventually burns out. When lit they give off a very yellow light but relatively little heat although a bit more than other LED lights that I have. I am planning to put them into a Ficus tree that we have indoors where I think they will look nice.
5,Fishies!,"I bought these for my sister. She's accessorizing her (and her hubby's) lake house with lotsa fish decorations. These are great (they actually look like fish, mounted bass in particular!). If you or yours are into fishing, this is a great stocking stuffer."
1,1 of 3 strings purchased will not light,I purchased 3 strings of these lights. I connected all 3 together to light up a county western theme Christmas tree. When first powered on the middle string did not light up. I removed each horse and noticed that every light on this string was black colored from the filament failure. I don't want to chance replacing all of the bulbs and just have it happen again.
5,Fish tale/,Great lights - part of our Christmas hunting and fishing theme for the den at the lodge. Everyone loved our tree and commented on the lights - well made and a great buy also!
3,"Rating of the trilogy, book itself gets 2","This group of Salvatore books was a fun read, as always, but I couldn't justify 4 or 5 stars. This 'trilogy' really didn't do much for me. The biggest problem I had with it was this book. It took care of some mildy interesting side plots which did keep me reading, but when I noticed I had only 50 pages left, I began to worry. The one thing I did not want from this trilogy was a quick and sloppy end to this war. I didn't get it, and for that I am glad. But that is the biggest flaw of this book. While some things get accomplished, it did nothing but set up an inevitable follow up. Don't get me wrong, I cannot wait for the conclusion to the orc conflict, and I will undoubtabley read the next set of books. However, this group was mediocre overall, with some good spots, and one of the most irritating endings I have ever read. Good trilogy with an incredibley disappointing ending."
1,"""Kill your darlings"" (Spoilers within)","I have always been a huge RAS fan. But when this series ended and Breunor was on his deathbed, NAY was dead with absolutely NO WAY of coming back. Viola, he's back and he is alive! Wha-? Huh?? He was d e a d. DEAD. There should be no reason for him to miraculously survive. It made no sense other than RAS is afraid to kill/ maim his characters. Maybe he should read Paul S. Kemp or GRR Martin for a glimpse of good authors who are not afraid to kill their characters. What a collosal letdown."
5,Another good story in a great series,"Only about halfway through the story now, and as with all the other in the series I think it is great. Drizzt is not as prominent so far in this story, it is focusing right now more on the orc attack on Mithral Hall. I really look forward to continuing this book and the rest of the Legend of Drizzt Series."
5,you're gonna hate me but...,this has been the most satisfying drizzt series i've read. why? because the big guy wins finally. you know who i mean. the most interesting character in FR...Obould Many-Arrows. he wins. the orcs finally win one. and its about damn time. why shouldn't the orcs have a nation of their own? why can't the progress as a people? finally those pompous dwarfs--and i love Bruenor as much as anyone--and those uppity elves get a kick in their teeth. Obould is doing something great and i'm excited to see it.
1,Just Awful,If you started out reading earlier volumes of R A's work featuring Drizzt and loved them then you may well be disappointed with his work on this trilogy and any future works. I myself will never pickup another book written by R.A. as his work has become horrible and a labor to read completely through.
2,Pretty bad.,"Unlike some other reviewers, I'll say the first 2 books in this trilogy were much better than the previous series, so I was very excited about this book.Big let down. I hope you didn't expect anything big to happen or anything. I hope you didn't become interested in any of the new characters like Nanfoodle or the dwarves who basically vanish from this book. I hope you didn't see into any of the foreshadowing about the good Drow goddess that's in FR 3.5 (Elliastrae sp?).It's just pretty bad. Everything seems rushed, characters aren't fleshed out at all. The only interesting part comes TOTALLY out of nowhere and has nothing to do with the previous 2 books. (Khazad'hea's adventure).I kind of wonder if Salvatore wishes he could just let Drizzt go.The epilouge lays the groundwork for the next series though. Let's all hope Salvatore finds some inspiration between now and then."
2,So disappointing,"I was very much let down by the conclusion of this book. Nothing becomes resolved except long, drawn out reunion of the companions. I think that Salvatore has to either return Drizzt to his roots of the greatest warrior in the realms or just let him fade away. How long can readers follow his exploits when he is constantly brought down by orcs and goblins after hearing how he defeated demons and dragons? I cannot begin to explain my sorrow at having bought this book in hardcover when it is hardly worth the paperback price. I own every book Rob has ever written but this is the first I have ever felt betrayed afterwards. Please let him learn the error of his ways soon before I move on and find more interesting tales to follow."
1,the series is grinding to a halt,"The Drizzt series has been a favorite of mine since i read the lone drow. I read all the others up to this point in about a year, and they were good reads. Now though, Salvatore just needs to get on with it and actually make something happen. This book, and the two before it, are incredibly slow and boring, as none of the villains have any depth and are basically there to annoy Drizzt and the gang. I also dislike the invincibility that all the main characters seem to possess. Just kill Bruenor or Catti-brie or someone please, it might accidentally spice things up a bit."
4,Was a gift,I bought this book as a gift for my brother and he liked it. Based on that I give it a rating of 4.
3,Christmas gift that my son wantedT,This the christmas gift my son had on his list. He knows exactly what he wanted as he has others. I know he is happy
4,Could have been better!!,"After reading all of Mr.Salvatore's books, and waiting eagerly for the next of drizzt's adventures, I was a little disappointed with the new book. The story started off fairly well with the first couple of chapters, but later nothing seemed to have happened in the book. I kind of felt bob was stretching the story to fill 300+ pages. Nevertheless, for loyal fans of salvatores work this is the kind of book which would make us wait for the next one. I would have given five stars had something more decisive had happened between drizzt,bree and wulfgar."
2,I hated to have to do this to my favorite author.,"Nothing happened in these three books other than me spending money. Something needs to change here and I hope the new ones bring on the change. Orcs? We are talking about a group of people that beat demons and a city of drow and dragons, etc. But they are at a stalemate with orcs? Not good. And NOTHING comes to a conclusion other than a few minor storylines. Could Salvatore be out of ideas with these group of adventurers? I hope not but this trilogy has left me with much doubt."
2,Shallow Writing for Shallow Readers,RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel. This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes.
4,Not his best but a good read.,"Not one of R.A's best but a good read. The only disappointment was the lack of closure that you would expect form a final book in a trilogy, but he does a masterful job in setting up his next trilogy. Unless you are a diehard fan like me wait for the paperback and save some money"
2,DIE HARD FAN,"I have to agree with most every one....this was terribly lame.R.A. Salvatore is an excellent writer and this was just not on par.Its great to read about the gang from the spine of the world.I can hardley wait till the next book comes out. But after this one..... well i hope he takes a much needed break. mabey write about the guys from the Servant of tha shard again?Any how if another book comes out on Drizzt, heh ill buy it, but not with the anticipation I used to have.in this book, nothing realy happens...i dont the there is even a decent part involving one of the main charaters. the supporting secondary charaters stories are good though.well hope to see more from R.A. Salvatore just hope he gets the break he needs before it comes out."
2,R.A. JORDAN ????,"Remember - there is no great hero without a great villain! Gone are the days of Matron Baenre, Llolth, Zak, the Underdark, dragons, the shard, Entreri, etc... We need more than an Orc with great armor! That was awful! I mean - give me Ellifain's superElf brother or something!Salvatore is a great writer but has failed to come with a good idea to breathe new life into his stories about Drizzt and his company. Much like Jordan - the books seem to go nowhere. Whether it is writing a book a hundred years into the future, including Cadderly or maybe some other forgotten realms characters, or another trip to the underdark - he has to do something which will break the monotony of what we are becoming used to: one of the main characters thinks another is dead, he/she gets pissed and kills everyone, a reunion with the main characters...."
3,THINGS TO BE AWARE OF,"-If you plug a mass storage device into the USB and there are more than 500 tracks stored on it, it won't read past the 500'th track. In other words, if you have 1,000 tracks stored it will read tracks 001 through 500, but ignores the rest.-At the start of each track, it cuts off the first second or two.If the above quirks don't bother you, than this is a decent player otherwise."
5,Marvelous Mono Men,Such awesome guitar-driven tunes. The mix of punk AND rock comes out great in the album. A super album for the Men!
5,lucky bums kids pack.,i hv just field tested 2 of these packs. the small+large. i am giving these packs 5 stars. they held up nicely. half the tm coming down the mountain we found these sliding down+not on purpose. i cant tell you tht they re big+roomy...they re not. bt the hydration kit was helpful+the mossy oak design was pleasing to the kids+i kinda dig it mys. the small sz was too big for our 3 yr old...bt it did fit the 5 yr old. they are of gd quality. i got them frm e bags. too bad i couldnt get the philipino girl to come with us tht helped me on the phone. tht was my only complaint.
5,fun reading,"This is exactly what I was hoping for. The buying experience was wonderful, will buy again from this seller - thanks."
2,Basic and uncomfortable,I had one of these a couple of decades ago and I could not remember why I stopped using it. I remember now. The knee cushion is not comfortable for sitting any longer than about 10 minutes. The chair is clunky and hard to move on the floor without picking is up. I will say the handle bars on the side are a big improvement over my earlier version.
4,Good but can be better,The knee area does not have enough cushion and this results in your knee hurting a bit if you sit at a stretch for more than 30 minutes. So I get up every now and then for a minute. Other than that it works great.
3,torn fabric- no replacement provided yet after almost 2 weeks,"I have emailed and ask the chair company to replace a defective handle on the chair that I purchased from them. The neoprene fabric covering a ""handle"" on the chair arrived torn. I have had NO response from the chair company."
3,Great breaks. Poor sound quality on the CD version.,"I bought this hoping that the breaks would be of high enough quality to use for sampling. I never sample CDs, but the vinyl is almost $200 (wtf?) so I figured I'd give this a shot since the previews were so ill. The breaks themselves are really really dope. The patterns are great, the tones, etc. Unfortunately, this being a CD & not a record, the greatness of the breaks is nullified by the poor sound quality. The mp3s are 320 kbps, but they are still mp3s & therefore compressed a ton. Beat heads know that you can't sample mp3s - I know that you can't sample mp3s too. I guess I was just hoping that they would be uncompressed .wav files since this is a break CD. No such luck.I want to give this a 1/5 rating, but it's my fault for buying the CD & not the vinyl.Bottom line: Buy the vinyl version if you have $200 to blow, but don't buy the CD if you plan to chop/sample these breaks."
3,Gorilla Thrilla,"Just another ""Man-is-bad,nature-is-good"" movie,the point of which is to show brain dead audiences that if humans would just vanish from the earth, the stately animals would prosper. Which is not to disparage the acting of Hopkins and Gooding -- they turn in outstanding performances. And the plot is realistic -- barely so -- and the movie keeps your attention throughout. Except for the two key actors, most of the others are average and uninspiring. And, when the movie's over, you know you have just watched another average film with a cliched and overdone plot."
3,"Good, but, but...","...it had the potential of being a classic on the level and very much like ""The Shawshank Redemption""--which has many moments that are sublimely well done--but somehow had lost something in the storytelling. True both Sir Hopkins and Gooding did fine jobs acting but I felt unconvinced that their characters' meeting changed anything about their lives...and let's face it, one of the reasons I watch movies is to be suckered in emotionally and fooled. 'Instinct' had a great premise marred by the lack of true chemistry between it's majors...take another look at ""Shawshank.."" and see what I mean."
2,Never moves past the obvious,"For me, this movie was very disappointing. I too, am a fan of the actors in this film, and had looked forward to seeing it. Unfortunately, the filmmakers were so afraid that their subject matter was too complicated for the average movie goer that they felt it necessary to review the same obvious conclusion over and over. This is demonstrated by their refusal to even vary the language, lest we be confused about who the 'takers' are. Had this movie assumed the audience is capable of following rational thought, it could have provided some unique insight and commentary regarding issues of society and control in general. Instead, the movie never moves beyond conclusions reached in the first 30 minutes, which overall, makes it little more than a very average, very boring film."
4,can only see it once,This movie was well written and anthony hopkins and cuba gooding jr. were great. This movie was so sad though. So if your a animal lover like me dont watch the part with the gorillas because you will cry. Other than that part it was so well performed.
3,Questioning our purpose here,"Anthony Hopkins is always fun to watch, and I have also grown to appreciate Cuba Gooding as obligatory to a good movie. The story line in this movie was pretty weak, but the philosophical questioning behind it is powerful. After spending 2 years living among gorillas Hopkins has established a new set of priorities in his life. His evaluating psychologist (Gooding) begins to question his own life and participation in ""the game"" of our society. The movie points out the importance of exploring existential questions like ""why are we here?"" and the resistence of our society to allow these questions to be a part of our lives."
5,Amazing,"I found this movie to be so well acted, not overreaching, sometimes very subtle, as Anthony Hopkins can do so well. I was also very impressed by Cuba's enthusiasm and presence. Hopkins with the gorillas was so natural, gentle, perceptive and accepting. A truly amazing movie. Marlene"
5,instinct,"anthony hopkins and cuba gooding jr are definately complimantry actors in this movie. it kept me guessing. if you are a fan of either of thiem, you really must see this movie."
3,"Remove the music, please","This could be and probably would be an excellent movie if it weren't for the fact that music played loudly throughout the film drowns out the characters' words.I found myself tempted to turn the movie off due to the irritation caused by the disruption, but felt the movie worth watching, regardless."
2,Good performances make dull film watchable!,"Both Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding turn in very good performances which unfortunatly do not elevate this movie above boredom levels. Possibly worth renting once, but I would not recommend purchaseing.The screen story is so predicable I found myself thinking 15 minutes ahead of what little involvement the movie offers."
2,Protect us from screenplays succh as Instinct's,"The acting was OK given the ludicrous screenplay. An untterly implausible plot coupled with stereotypical characters (the doubting youn doctor, the older doctor, the prison guard, the prison doctor, the warden) and the ""in your face"" direction made this a film to remember.When a man goes off to live in forest with gorillas and leaves his knife behind, and takes no food, he is a fruit-cake. He is also a selfish fruit-cake having abandoned his family. He is also a dim fruit-cake having killed one of the baddies and not taking his rifle.Plot and character are important. Sentimentality isn't."
1,How do you keep 'em down on the farm...,"What is so romantic about the primitive jungle life? What is so noble about the mindlessness of the ape? Most peoples try to better themselves by building a barricade against the brutality of unadorned nature. Most animals in nature are prey, both to predators and to disease, There is only beauty in savagry if you can view it from a protected vantage.The philosophy that begat this film is rather childish and silly. Better adults don't take it too seriously."
1,1 star because I couldn't rate it lower...,"OK, for those of you who liked ""Instinct"", how about this scenario:There's this kid living an a country with what he sees as an oppressive government. He lives day in and day out with this oppressive government placing its boot on the back of his neck. He knows there's a better way to live, and he's willing to do anything to achieve his dream.After years of oppression he forms a plan. He joins the government's army and serves long enough to acquire the skills allowing him to manufacture and use very destructive weapons. Then one day he blows up a government building, killing 168 people. He's caught, of course, and lacking the help of Cuba Gooding Jr., is put to death.A story about a man who kills people in support of his ""better"" way of living.When will Hollywood make *this* movie?And no, I'm not a McVeigh fan, I'm just pointing out how much evil ""Instinct"" hides under its environmentalist political correctness."
4,Anthony Hopkins & Cuba Gooding Jr. great performance,"The story could be not all that, although it is still an interesting story.But what I liked the most of this movie is the BRILLIANT speech of the characters... oh both Anthony Hopkins & Cuba Gooding Jr. were so good."
4,Thought Provoking Experience,"Based on Daniel Quinn's ""Ishmael"" the experience pits the illusions of freedom offered by civilization against natural order. The movie has an excellent star base with Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Donald Sutherland. ""Instinct"" is and excellent movie for those looking for intellectual stimulation or for just entertainment."
4,More than adequate,"Hopkins is always awesome.. Gooding is good too. It's definitely worth watching, but the ""bad man,good earth"" motif is flogged to death, true though the premise may be. And there's a little too much symbolic gesturing for my liking: Cuba standing in the rain like our Tony did, Cuba holding his hands out to be manacled just like our Tony did, etc etc.. a small sigh at those points but apart from that it's good to keep you off the streets for a couple of hours."
4,Wonderful stuff!,This CD is a family favorite we have nearly worn it out! It is a great one to have playing during dinner.
3,"Richard Dreyfuss and sharks under water before ""Jaws""","Research Scientist Fred Miller (Tony Randall) invents the underwater house of the future. His boss T.R. Hollister (Jim Backus) thinks it was a waste of money. So to save his job and commit to secrecy Fred convinces his ""typical"" family to live there for 30 days. And we know what happens when a typical family gets stuck together for 30 days anywhere.The film is a tad dated and you have to slog through hockey parts. We hear sixties bubblegum. There is an exceptional amount of slapstick fuller. However it is fun to see actors before they were fully formed and those that are not with us anymore.A partial list of actors:Tony RandallJanet LeighJim BackusKen BerryCharlotte RaeRichard DreyfussArnold StangHarvey Lembeck - Beach Party (1963) - Eric Von ZipperOne day we may see a revival of Fluffy (1965) with Tony Randall, and Shirley Jones.The Brass Bottle"
5,Hello Down There,This is a wonderful family movie.My sister and me were talking about movies we loved when we were young and this one was one of them.I would tell anyone who ever dreamed about living under water to watch this movie its fun.
4,Good feeling movie,"This is a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid but I remembered it. Yes it's corny in places, but it makes you laugh and wish for a simpler time. Family friendly, but adults will enjoy it as much as the kids."
3,"Guaranteed to give you ""the bends""","What a fun movie! The concept of living in an underwater house is enough for a story, not to mention adding the top comedy actors of the day and super groovy 60's music ( little goldfish is my favorite ). This movie is good clean fun for the whole family. With plenty of action and laughs for everyone. This long lost classic will charm even today.."
5,An Early Richard Dreyfuss Curio!! At last On DVD!!!,"This is a great fun early Richard Dreyfuss classic comedy curio with a great cast!!At last on DVD,it's a must see!!!!!!!"
3,It Made A Great Gift,"I'm not really sure how to rate this movie...I actually bought it for my sister who has loved this movie since childhood. Shhhh don't tell anyone how old we are K?! LOL Anyways, she was very excited to get it and we sat down and watched straight-a-way. It was kind of funny to see these guys in their younger days! I'm not into the movie really, but she STILL is! It made her day! Thanks Amazon!"
3,Keeps bed dry but slides allot,It does keep the bed dry when my child has an accident. But it slides allot so sometimes the sheets still get wet.
2,Not a good product,We used this on our son's (4 year-old) bed. The few accidents he had this product proved to not work (naturally he has a brand new mattress). Perhaps this is waterproof for a drop of water.....It is nice and soft but if it cannot handle an accident what is the point. Not a good product for us and I cannot recommend this.
1,VInyl Backing,"I will be returning this pad unused, while the description says polyester the package states vinyl backing. It does indeed have the tell tale smell of vinyl. I bought this for my son due to bed wetting issues and refuse to have this toxic substance off-gas while he sleeps"
2,Mattress pad,"Pad does what it is generally designed to do: keep the mattress dry in the event of an accident. However, unless you do not move while sleeping, the pad does not stay flat under the sheet. This requires significant extra effort when making the bed each day so that it does not ball up and make sleeping uncomfortable."
3,"Easy to use, but easy to fall off","This product works great when it stays under my son, but half the time, he moves around so much in his sleep that he still gets the bed wet. If I had some kind of ability to hold it in place, I would give it 5 stars."
5,GOOD SOLUTION,"THE PRODUCT IS LARGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. IT WORKS WELL AND COSTS THE SAME AS A SMALLER PRODUCT I HAD PURCHASED BEFORE. NO MORE WET BEDS, EVEN WITH TOSSING AND TURNING IN THE NIGHT!!"
1,"Sticker on package says ""Not suitable for children under 12""!!!","I opened the box containing the TWO pads that I purchased and on both packages is a sticker stating: ""Warning: Not suitable for use by children under the age of 12."" I am unclear as to why this is not clearly stated in the product description. There is no reason given, though I'm assuming that the pads are not ""breathable"" and young children can suffocate. Looks like I will be returning these."
3,sheet protector,This bed pad is bigger than I needed otherwise it is very nice and I am using it folded in half as a chair pad. I probably did not look at the size listed when I ordered.
4,Good product,I used this product for my two year old boy on his bed. It covers more area than the regular baby bed pad. It works very well and it's not as hevay as the one in the hospital. Good product.
5,Best waterproof sheet protector EVER!,"I purchased this pad in September 2010 for my father, who has dementia and lives with us. He is increasingly incontenant and wears Depends to bed, but consistantly overflows them. The smaller pads I had from my kids as babies were not large enough. This pad is awesome, very large, and contains the liquid. It has saved me many loads of laundry. I immediately purchased another, and may be buying a third soon just to have extra on hand. If you have a bed to protect, or wish to cut down on laundry due to accidents, this is the one to buy!"
4,Withstands everyday washes and stays waterproof,"I used it for my son for four months already.It does stand the washing machine, and is still waterproof.It can absorb lot of liquid.The only problem is that it is does not cover the entire bed, so it is only partial protection.I now use it over my luna bed cover, so if my son wets the bed in the middle of the night, I can take out this one, and still has Luna there.=============Review after one year of use= = = = = = =I bought two more sets of this sheet protector.Is the ONLY one that really stays waterproof.I also bought others 2 sets of LUNA, and they stopped being waterproof after few months of everyday wash.My son is autistic and he wets bed almost every night.Now I have 3 sets of this protector and it is a peace of mind because no matter how many washes, they stay waterproof.I still use it over the LUNA protector, and underneath the LUNA I have another plastic, because LUNA is no longer waterproof after many washes."
5,Best Protection,I'm very pleased with this product. Must be totally saturated at the edge for any leaks to occur. Have been washed and dried on gentle cycle. I came back to order three more.
3,BEWARE - Not for children!,"I ordered this sheet protector to protect the bed my 4-yr old grandson uses when he visits. As soon as I took the package out of the Amazon box, I noticed a large label affixed to the BACK of the package that says ""Warning: Not suitable for use by children under the age of 12."" There is no explanation of why this cannot be used for children, so I have NO idea why it is unsafe - perhaps it's not fire retardant, or a suffocation risk?I am glad the warning is on the package, but to avoid inconvenience, I feel that Amazon should have placed this warning in the description on it's website, so customers will know the product is intended for adults (incontinence, etc.)Amazon sent me a free return postage label and promised to refund my money when the product arrives there, so they did the right thing. I just want to advise others that this product is not for children.Thank you."
1,Not for kids,"I bought two of these for my 3 year old son's bed, but when I received them, there was a sticker on the back that said they were not for use by children under age 12. It would be helpful to have this in the description."
5,Wonderful product,"Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector, WhiteI bought some of these sheet protectors for my 90 year old mother who lives in an assisted living home. They are wonderful and very absorbant. After the first night she said she never had such a good nights sleep....very comfortable and no worries about an ""accident."""
1,not waterproof,"this is NOT WATERPROOF.I had such high hopes for this...i liked the size and fit nicely on a full bed.but after day 1, it soaked thru this pad, thru the sheets,thru the mattress pad, and right onto the actual mattress. Pretty worthless."
3,"Waterproof, yes, but somewhat annoying","I bought this based on previous reviews when I was searching easy to clean and remove bed protection. It did do a good job of protecting the bed from wetness during our child's bedwetting phase when positioned correctly, but it was annoying in that it did stay put very well and needed frequent repositioning, whether used over or below the fitted sheet. When below the fitted sheet, it would bunch up and ripple and the edges were very noticeable because it is somewhat stiff. Fortunately, my daughter did not seem to mind. Washing and drying was much easier than a full fitted waterproof mattress pad so it served its purpose for us."
5,Used for toddler potty training,Love it! I put it right on top of my daughter's full size bed sheet. It will move around if you are a restless sleeper. I put one under my son's twin sheets. I purchased 3 already. Have a spare one incase of accident. Put it right in washing machine. I line dry it mostly hoping it would last longer. Still in good condition.
3,Works but slips,"This sheet protector does a fabulous job absorbing moisture and keeping sheets dry. Unfortunately, contrary to other reviewers, I found that the protector does slip. Most mornings I find it hanging halfway off my son's bed. It could be that he's just a mover and a shaker in his sleep; perhaps someone who sleeps more soundly wound't have such trouble."
3,Priva Sheet Protector,Does not do well being washed. The back of the pad flakes off after a few washings.
5,Helpful for pet incontinence too. Save on buying disposable pads.,"I have a 15 year old cat that has become incontinent while sleeping (we are just starting oral incontinence remedies). She really wants to be around us and we don't want to confine her to another room. I bought these to protect our comforters and it's working out. They do keep you a bit warm in the bed though you may have to start using thinner blankets. I'd suggest attaching some snaps without penetrating the barrier on the other side to attach them each other for best protection. The can slide a bit during the night.I have washed and dried these pads many times and they are holding up well.If want more comforter protection try the Bedwetting store they sell waterproof duvets which I will use in conjuction with these. Whether your incontinent pet sleeps with you, on your couch or you want to protect their bed this is an economic alternative to buying puppy pads. These give far more coverage for the area you are trying to protect."
3,Seemed great....but,"Well made, comfortable and a wonderful value but only lasted six months. Backing cracked. Unfortunate as it was the best wetness protector we have had."
3,"Okay, but not the solution I was looking for","After reading all the reviews, I thought this was worth a try for my 8 year old. However, it's no big enough to keep her entire bed dry, mostly because she moves around in her sleep. Also, her covers and blankets still get soaked, so only if I'm really lucky do I just have to wash the pad."
3,Serves its purpose,I got this for myself postpartum. It doesn't breathe well so I was waking up in pools of sweat but otherwise it serves its purpose and fits my side of the queen bed well. Wish it was a bit more breathable (though still waterproof) but otherwise good product. Washes well.
2,It shifts around,This pad moves around a lot. It does not stay in place and that is a problem if you want to use it on top of your sheets.
4,Came back for more!,Kiddo is nearly 2 and prone to diaper leaks in the middle of the night and just barely potty training. These are wonderful. We cosleep and one of these under her side of the bed lets me quickly change her area if it happens. It also makes mornings much nicer if it happens even after I change her in the middle of the night. It's a quick change and I don't have to worry about leaks on the tempurpedic! She also has reflux and can be prone on bad days to throwing up. This has held up very well to multiple washings and sanitizings. Which is why I came back for more. We also use these on the spare bed where we change her during the day and it is a great preventative. She tends to sleep hot and this doesn't seem to bother her at all. It's a good size too so I don't have to worry if she rolls closer to me to snuggle that she'll be off the pad. Highly recommended.
5,Easy to use and works great,This pad works just like it says. My son has night time potty problems and has used it for 2 yrs and it works great since its large enough not to get bunched up when he rolls around at night and it stays put better then the other one i have. This one has a rubber/plastic bottom side to help keep it in place and to keep the bed dry underneath. Its also easy to take off and wash and you don't have to change the entire bed. Worth the buy.
3,Privia Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector,"This item does not lay flat, bunches up in wrinkles and is uncomfortable to lie on, but it DOES protect bedding."
4,Great pad,My mother suffers from incontience and had not found any pad that provided the waterproof quality she needed. This pad is large enough and is very waterproof. She is thrilled with it.
5,large enough to do the job,This larger waterproof pad is sized perfectly to handle most any bed-wetting problem. I alternate with two of them and they have stood up to repeated washings and dryings just fine. I used to have to use 2 of the smaller ones to get enough coverage.
5,Great,I washed it before I used it and it came out soft and with out pills. I have not had a problem with the performance and am satisfied.
4,Keeps the bed dry!,"Good service and shipping. Pads are a little too large for my wife They go from head to foot which may work well for someone else. Probably this length will be good in the summer to asorb the sweat. The main reason for the four star rating is that my two had a slight chemical smell until they were washed a several times. Nothing a person can't live with. However, they seem to work for the purpose intended. Nothing has leaked through."
5,Works great!,I bought this to use for my 3 year old daughter and it works great when she has accidents during the night. I use two to ensure she is covered during the night since she tends to roll around. I use it on a queen size bed and I have positioned it across the bed as opposed to up and down. I leave about a 3 inch overlap with the second one and my bed is covered no matter where my little girl rolls.
5,Excellent!,"We use this for a child not yet potty trained at night and it saves us so many sheet washings! If there is a leaky overnight diaper, just take off the pad and wash that and put on another one. Buy two!"
4,Sleep with confidence...,"My wife had been looking for a bed liner to protect the mattress during that 'time of the month'. She came across this one and is pleased that it does the job! She can sleep in confidence. However, she gives it only 4-stars because it does crinke or roll-up in some area, but since it's large in size, your mattress is still protected."
5,Life saver!,"With a few kids that bed wet, this pad is a life saver! I was constantly washing sheets in the middle of the night! Now all I do is roll up the pad and Im done!"
3,"Waterproof, but is it safe for kids?","I purchased this mattress pad almost a year ago for a toddler with occasional accidents at night. My first impression was that although is was not crackly and noisy like a lot of other protectors, the cover was kind of rough and scratchy. It did protect the mattress from wetness, but only when my squirmy toddler actually stayed in one place while sleeping. Most of the time it slipped, bunched up, or my son just kicked it off the bed on purpose because he says the pad is not soft. The top really pills up wash after wash and makes it even scratchier. Now as I return to this product page to write a review I am shocked to see some reviewers warnings about this product not being safe for children under 12. We have been using this product for almost a year and there was no sticker warning on the back when I purchased mine! The product page should have this information in the product description."
5,great floor protector.,In the country I put this down just inside the back door when the men and children are coming in with dirty shoes. It absorbs liguid very well and is easy to shake out and wash.
3,"Absorbs well, doesnt stay put.","I bought this for my child who has occasional accidents. we take it with us trips so we dont have issues in hotels etc. It is comfortable for him and is easiy portable. It does absorb well, no mess went through to the sheet below. However, it does tend to bunch up and scoot around easily and for that, i gave it 3 stars. May be better for an adult who does not tend to move around so much in their sleep."
2,sheet protector,"I should have taken previous reviews more seriously. I purchased two of these for an elderly parent with incontinence issues. Although the product looks and feels nice, it does not stay in place while in use. It moves every time my mother moves and is a source of discomfort and annoyance to her. Disappointing purchase."
4,Learning Letters,This book is really good but we like the Jumbo book of things that Go a little better.
3,weak for a heavy duty staple gun,Good construction. Easy to use. But it's weak for a heavy duty staple gun. My rusty arrow heavy duty staple gun had no trouble driving staples into pine but this gun with the same staples left a gap between staple and wood.
5,Best one I have ever used,"This stapler does exactly what I want with any staple I have in stock, no matter what the make. A bonus: thumb wheel to control striking action."
5,"A fantastic resource for parents, or anyone working with children","Excellent practical tips, and examples which really get you thinking. A must for ayone who wants their children to love books and learning."
4,Great resource,"Even though it said 14-21days, I didn't expect to really take that long. I think I waited 20days-too long. The book is a great resource & does explain ways to show children how wonderful reading and writing can be. Also, how we can show them this everyday. From reading other reviews, I thought there would be more activities. Definitely a book to recommend to new parents."
5,A Wonderful Resource,"This book changed the way that I looked at my children's learning and the way that I conducted myself around them. It's full of practical ideas that anyone can do and vindicated some of my own instincts. It may bother people who think their children need to be in organized activities all the time. The book stresses that creativity often comes from having the time to think and dream.It also gives ways to help you communicate with your child and also about how what you say about your life reflects in your child's view of the world. Another item which was helpful was the idea that it's okay for kids to try things and fail or not do them perfectly as long they keep trying.I'm the mom of two very creative, bright kids and I think this book is partly responsible."
5,Good seller,Beside your item or any item I bought it in Amazon.comI wanna say...thanks Amazon because honesty is very important for me !
5,It is all there!,A thoughtful and truthful look into the history of caberet in Manhattan. Very thorough. Informative. Accurate. Barbra Streisand and Mabel Mercer are included. All the venues are included as well. A niche book for anyone interested in this genre. A superb history of night life in New York City.
5,It Works,"My paradigm of science has been expanded. I bought the syncrometer. I bought the video by Carmen Myers. I bought the Syncrometer Science Manual. I sat down one afternoon with all of the above. After three hours of practice, it worked.I will never, NEVER be the same again!!"
5,Synchrometer Science Laboratory Manual,This book is the finest book written by Hulda Clark that goes to the nitty gritty of cleansing the body and chasing out the polutants and invaders. The progress Hulda Clark has done in the field of health in mere 15 years could not be done by Allopaty in hundreds of years.Fantastic job!
3,"Cheap, and poor quality","I ordered up a couple of remote controlled for my 6 and 8 year old cousins from two different companies.I opened the package only after a month of arrival and I was pretty disappointed with this.This toy can fly just up and down, and the other control did not seem to work. Any way we did not need it the next day, since the helicopter did not survive from the crash from just 8 feet. We spent a few hours with this, and the battery is one real horror.There are plenty of other options on the store. This[...]was [...] or so. Very flexible, flies like a pro [you need a whole day to gain control though, not for beginners] and the battery is very good."
2,Broke the first time,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and we tried it out today, it broke on the first try. He is going to try to fix it tomorrow. We would not recommend this helicopter to anyone, it is all plastic, made in China and the instruction manual has really bad English translation. Do your research before buying one of these, apparently there is a lot more to it than I thought."
1,DEFECTIVE ITEM AND TERRIBLE SERVICE,"I purchased a Dragonfly Radio Control RC Helicopter Hughes 300 9093 as a Christmas present for my grandson. It arrived defective and never worked. Attempts to get the company to replace the item were very frustrating. I was being required to pay the return shipping for their defective product and was told that I ""might"" get a replacement in a couple of weeks if their staff felt that it was appropriate. This is the first really bad dealings I have had through Amazon. I am surprised that Amazon lets companies abuse customers in this way!"
1,garbage,ultra-cheap and shoddy toy. was in the garbage within a half hour. Here are some extra words so I can post this review without persistently being looped back to the same screen.
1,Don't buy it,"This thing isn't enable to fly we did all that the manual say and even it didn't fly, the worst gift that I gave in this christmas."
2,"very sensitive, no speakerphone",since the keypad is very sensitive very difficult to use it. Those who like to have speakerphone don't buy it. I cannot rate this product well
4,Satisfied,I recently purchased LG KG800 Chocolate. I liked its presentation and its reception is really good. Only one thing which might be a problem with users is that its navigation buttons are too sensitive.Overall I liked it.
2,mEXICO MANUAL AND CHEAP QUALITY,"I bought it from Amazon shiping to me fast. But next day I call Amazon to return it with the reason the manual book written in Spanish which I can't read or undwerstand and it look very cheap quality.Many customers like me complaint Amazone not reveal in small detail or correct something written on the goods( like Motorola V8 orV9.It is high end cell and expensive, the customers want to know what content it had in box?where it made from? The other sellers online Ebay, Bestbuy said very detail in box)"
2,poor,wasn't working good. had to return this item. Would never purchase this item again. decided to go with a different phone instead.
5,VERY NICE PHONE,"THIS PHONE ITS A REALLY GREAT BUY AND A REALLY GREAT PRICE, IT WORKS VERY GOOD, TAKE NICE PICTURES, CLEAR SOUND, I RECOMEND IT"
4,Extensive and easy format!,"This book is a good reference book for writers and for those with an interest in our changing culture. I borrowed this book from my public library, but decided to purchase it because I didn't want to give it back at the end of my loan period."
2,Good South American Music,"Not a bad album, but in my opinion it is lacking the power, the anger and the political statement of the older Inti Illimani albums."
3,Same Old Same Old,"If you like The Law of Attraction and I love it. and haven't seen too many other videos then you will love this but I find that a lot of the DVD's are the same people over and over again. In this DVD there wasn't much new that I hadn't already seen. I'm not talking about the same story or facts, they are the same people in the same situations. Still it's a good message but I was hoping for different people talking about different situations to make their point. I find this with most of their products. The Hicks have become much more marketing oriented and are putting out products that have different titles but little new material. I still really enjoy all the Abraham has to say I am just thinking that they are getting too much into selling. I'm all for profit but I don't want to feel ripped off and I'm starting to."
4,"Trainer is awesome, Amazon service poor","I finally received my trainer after almost a month, 24 days to be exact! The item shipped to a nearby warehouse the day after placing the order only to sit there. I contacted Amazon several times and Amazon promised to remedy the issue. On one occasion Amazon promised to ship item again but, it never happened. Amazon did not provide quality support in my opinion."
5,Practical advice - buy this book to help with mediation,"I often look at reviews for practical advice, i.e., if people like me read the book and get something out of it, then I want it. Well, as a trial lawyer and as someone who would benefit a lot from doing my best at mediation, Jeff Krivis' book is a DEFINITE READ. Mr. Krivis' style is clear and very easy to understand. After setting forth various fact patterns that an experienced lawyer might see, he shows how different approachs to meditation settle the case. This is a window into how to a top mediator thinks about your case and the strategies he uses to help both sides resolve their differences. What could be better?In case I wasn't clear - BUY THIS BOOK."
4,Rose Sims Sees It Right,"Dr. Rose Sims has turned around churches, not just once, but multiple times. In this book, she shares how she did it. Her solutions are so down-to-earth that you will wonder why you never saw the opportunities yourself in your own situation.Don't expect a bit of defeatism or pessimism in this book. You won't find any.Sims says simply that wherever the church is nearly empty, that means there are many people in the area of the church that don't have a church home. Simply begin to reach them."
4,kitchen cleaning,"Did all my kitchen cabinets with this product. It works very well. Would recommend it to my friends. Does not leave a film on cabinets, as some products do."
1,Non-Toxic?!!!!,How is this non-toxic when it falls under California's proposition California Proposition 65 warning. I'd rather have dirty cabinets!California Proposition 65Attention California Residents:California's Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels. We care about our customers' safety and hope that the information below helps with your buying decisions.The general Proposition 65 notice is as follows:WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.
5,Works Well,"I've used this cream on my wood furniture. It applies easily, is not sticky or greasy. It gives a nice shine.I will purchase it again and I recommend it."
2,Expected More from this Product,Purchased this item to remove grease from wool/oak kitchen cabinets.Three cleanings still did not remove all of the grease.
1,Does not remove grease as stated,The only reason I purchased this product was to remove the sticky residue off my cabinets that are near my stove. I used the product and tried with all of my might to get the grease out to no avail... waste of money. Might work for making your cabinets shine but not for cleaning as stated on the bottle. I guess castor oil is my next purchase.
5,johnny Tremain,"Great Book. Historically accurate, with a sweet storyline. A very enjoyable read. Great for a intermediate reader. A great book from my past."
5,A amazing read,I read this book for school but I fell in love with Johnny. He is such a great young man who learns many good lessons. Great read for all ages and those who love great literature.
5,Johnny Tremain,"In this epic novel, Johnny Tremain, Esther Forbes through the eyes of a young boy, shows us what struggles America went through to become free. In Forbes only children's book Johnny, the main character, meets old Revolutionary heroes such as Sam Adams and Paul Revere. As the book progresses Johnny discovers hard times during the fight for freedom. Forbes takes Historical Fiction a step further by putting real characters and events in this story. Joy and sorrow are two of the many moods throughout the book. Set in Colonial Boston, Forbes story is a true Heart warmer. This book is challenging and appropriate for fourth grade and up. Forbes classic novel, for a good reason, won the Newberry Award, it is a true winner."
1,why did you write this??? what a horrible book!,"This book is so dull. I would have never finished this book if my student teacher had't made me. Still I have noticed that peole either love this book, or they hate it. If you enjoy exiting books: DO NOT READ!!!!!!!!"
3,Gives intersting look at the Revolution and apprentices,"I read this book later in life than most, having not been required to read it in grammar school, and found it an interesting read. The book does an good job of portraying 18th century Boston and the lives of apprentices. The book is also interesting for its ability to cast the hero as one who is disabled for a large portion of the story and his struggles to deal with his new found limitations. Of course the highlight of the book must be the description of the British march on Lexington in Concord that began a Revolution that would eventually result in a new nation being born. I recommend this book to those who enjoy historically based fiction based on the events surrounding the American Revolution."
3,Not the best but not the worst,"The book was good but not great.If your into wars and battles this book is good ,but if your not the war type I wouldn't read it you won't be instrested."
2,I thought it was ok,"I thought it was pretty good. It was deftinetly dull in many places. It was well written. I would not reccomend this book, it was too dull and lifeless."
3,Johnny Tremain,"Johnny Tremain is a very exciting book about the Civil War,and Johnny's friends, Dusty 9 Dove 11. It's set in the US. It is also about the exciting dangerous adventures Johnny has with his friends in the wilderness. I kind of liked this Esther Forbes because she adds lots of detail."
2,How the heck did this win the Newbery award?!,"Johnny Tremain is one of the slowest book I've ever read! It has way to many characters (at least half of them the story could do without), that made it not very easy to follow. How t ever won the newbery award, is something i'll never know. I don't think you'll like Johnny Tremain."
2,stupid book...,"This book sucked...I hated it...One of the worst I have everread...It went from living in the city, happy as a duck thensuddenly.... BANG!!.... It went to the Boston Tea Party and everyone joined the war...Dont read it... It failed to keep me interested aswell, and its a good thing I only HAD to read this for 8th grade language arts... a project that also kinda ""ripped"" apart thebook... If you are a teacher, you might recognize the words ""Blooms Taxonomy"".... that is what we had to do to this... book...There, I spoke my words"
3,Not interesting for teenagers,"This is a good audio version of the book by Esther Forbes but even as such not very interesting for Teenagers who are the targeted group of readers/listeners. The story lacks a certain tension and depth but depicts events and background at the time quite well.My son, who had to read it for school, used the audio version to find certain passages quicker and was bored out of his wits by it."
1,More cons than pros,"This story is set during the Revolutionary War and is about an apprentice to a silver smith. He injures his hand and thinks he will never work with silver again. He gets involved with the Boston Tea Party, the midnight ride of Paul Revere etc.The book Johnny Tremain can be described in many ways. But 'a good book' is not one of them. I would definetly not recommend this book. It was good in the beginning, but after that,the plot went downhill. It took me a while to read this book because I was reluctant to read it. One good thing, however, is the details on the Revolutionary War."
5,Highly Recommended!,"This is my daughter's favorite book. My sons enjoyed it too. They all dress up and act it out. It is filled with fun, excitement and adventure. It takes place prior to and during the Revolutionary War. (Not Civil War as another reader wrote). It introduces many of the famous people of the time."
3,Johnny Tremain: An Assigned Summer-reading book,"For summer reading, this book wasn't awful, but I have read a lot better. I just finished Johnny Tremain today. Some parts were good, some not so good. I enjoyed the book when it got more into acts such as the Boston Tea Party and the battles. If you have this book for summer reading, just get it over with. Read it all at once. Good for long car trips. Try taking notes. But if you don't HAVE to read it, don't."
3,It was OK.,"I read this book for a class book report (8th grade). It had some slow parts, but overall it was OK. I think someone needs to write a sequel to tie up some loose ends. That would help alot."
4,"""Johnny Tremain""","""Johnny Tremain"" was easy for me to relate to because Johnny was about my age. This historical-fiction novel seemed very real to me through the endless illustrations it gave. The reality of a war struck home with me as I read,""Johnny Tremain,"" after the September 11 attacks. I saw through the book how blessed our nation is that we do not have to fight on our own nation's soil, as they did in, ""Johnny Tremain."" The characters had distinct personalities and mannerisms, allowing me to picture them in my mind. ""Johnny Tremain,"" is a book I would recommend to my friends as a informative elaboration on the daily life af an American during the Revolutionary War."
2,Johnny Tremain,"It is 1770, Boston, Massachusetts. Johnny is an apprenticed silversmith. He lives with the Laphams. Johnny is the best in the house until he burns his hand. Since his hand is burned and useless, he is unable to continue his career as a silversmith. No one will hire him. Who would, his hand is burned. He looks day and night but he just can't find a job. He finally gets a job as a rider for the Boston Observer. He has never been on a horse before but his good friend Rab agrees to teach him. Johnny and Rab become closer friends as the book goes on. There are many wars in Johnny Tremain. Doctor Warren is able to fix Johnny's hand with a simple surgery.Review by Jamie"
3,"Good for teaching history, but not a great book","I read this in high school 15 years ago and I remember it being somewhat dull. It taught me a little about history, but it didn't hold my attention like other classics. Just a so-so book."
1,Someone Needs to Say This,"When I was in middle school I was assigned this book to read during the year. While normally I praise books and love reading, this is the worst book I have ever read. I'm serious. It is overly detailed and the characters are flat. It does not pull the reader in. If you are interested in the American Revolution this is the book for you. Otherwise, burn it."
1,CRAPPY,"This book was so boring i fell asleep every other pagealso there are other good historical fiction books out thereand ones about the civil war or w/ethis book is so incredibly tedious that if i had to read it in one sitting i would diedo not make your students read this they will try their best to skip reading itbelieve me my class was forced to do a literary curve and everybody went online and cheated because they read most of the book and found it so boringplease have a heart, and don't make your students sufferPLEAsEPLEASEnobody cares its a ""good reading tool"" if you want people to be encouraged to read don't make them sit through the boringest book ever writtenjust listen to me and rethink getting thisHAVE A HEARTi am afraid if i am forced to read something this boring again i will die of boredom"
5,Great Book,"This a great book. The kindle version saved my daughter when she left her copy at school and needed to finish it over the weekend. But, I really enjoyed the book too."
5,Johnny Tremain,This book was great.It really gave me a clear picture of what the times close to the Revolutionary War.It was filled with action and that little picture in my mind never went away.It was a little boring at certain times(I would've given it a 10 if it wasn't for this)but overall it was really great and I would recommend to anyone of any age to read it.
3,A freak accident,"Johnny Tremain is the story of a young silversmith who has a freak accident and is looking for a job that will suit his abilities. This is a good book that has several battle scenes. I only wish it had Johnny as a soldier. Overall, it was a fairly good book."
3,Why should I read Johnn Tremain?,"Johnny Tremain is an 15 year old boy who wants to be an execellent silversmith. This book is about his life in Boston and the obstacles that get in his. This is a great book and I really enjoyed it. He learned how to deal with his disability. He was a good friend and a nice person to the people who he cared about. Johnny cared about his friends, especially his best friend Rab."
3,The war against the British,I like the book because it was talking about history. It was fun to read about how the americans lost against the British the first time.Then they won against the british the second time. I thought that when good people to johnny died i felt like crying. Like if one of my family members that died in the war like if it was my older brother or my dad.
3,Not the best,"Esther Forbes's Johnny Tremain is a combination of somber and witty characters. Although some of the characters were very unpleasant, like Mr. Lyte, you can learn some wise lessons from them. The book did drag in a lot of places. One of the places was is the beginning of the book where they tell how The Lapham's lived. Johnny Tremain is the silversmith apprentice for Mr. Lapham. When Johnny injures his hand he is rudely thrown away because he is of no use to the family anymore. After a long search, he finds a place to live at the Boston Observer just as the war begins. In this book you will meet different personalities and see how they change. Some are not very captivating. I recommend this book for people who take pleasure in learning about history."
3,Johnny Tremain,Great For History Lovers Johnny Tremain was an enjoyable book. It taught me a lot about the Boston Tea Party and The Revolutionary War. It was an interesting story about Johnny's apprenticeship at a silversmith shop. He did something to his hand and had to find a new job. This book is about his new life.It had extremely good characterization. All the characters were well developed such as I could relate to Johnny because he was just a little bit older than me and I felt like I knew him. Except that he was arrogant unlike me. In some parts it became slow-moving. Then there would be big plot jumps which I didn't like. You should read it and see if you like it.
3,Mixed feelings,I think the story itself is great but I really wanted something to appeal to my son so I got the book on CD as well as the Disney movie. The movie is great and appeals to a boy but the audio is dry and read by a woman. It would be a 5 star for me if it was dramatized and was read by a male voice.
4,Johnny Tremain Book Review,"I read this book for a book project at school. The character Johnny Tremain is a 14 year old boy that is an apprentice for Mr.Lapham, a silversmith in Colonial Boston. The book is set in the Revolutionary War time, as you go along with Johnny. Esther Forbes uses great detail and she makes you thing; What is going to happen next? I thought it was going to be thoughs average war books where everyone dies, but it turned out to be an excellent written war novel!"
4,Excellent!,"This is an excellent book! A bit slow to start off with, but after the first 2 chapters or so it really flies. I had to read it for school, and was prepared for a horrible book, being as they have a tendency to picked awful books. What a pleasant surprise! Though, I was very disappointed by the ending, I would recommend this book highly!"
3,An Okay Book,"The book was ok but it was hard to follow at times. It does however, tell about the Booston Tea Party and the Civil War. Also it talks about how people thought and what people did to those they did not like."
3,Johnny Tremain,"Johnny Tremain I thought was a very good book. It was very real life and you can understand how disappointed he was when he had to find a new profession because he had a disability. The stories they told about the war were neat and believable to hear. The Sons of Liberty were an actual group and it was interesting to learn more about the people in it, the meetings, and what all they did to help the Patriots. Overall, this book was factual and very good."
3,The ending was wierd,This was a good book.....not as good as my brother sam is dead.Everything was good except the ending. IT was wierd. It left me stupified. (...)
2,Johnny Tremain,"Johnny Tremain is about a young man about 13 years old who is an apprentice for an old silversmith during The American Revolution. He has a sudden accident and hurts his hand and has to quite being th apprentice. He then goes off and searches for another jod and finds his friend Rad. Later on Rad is killed in action fighting for the Continental Army. Johnny then has to take up Rad's gun and fight for the cause. ""Johnny Tremain"" is an histoical fiction book.I think this book is best for someone who is interested in the American Revolutoion and likes books that are adventurous and exiting.I didn't Really like this book. It didn't grab my attention that well."
5,Johnny Tremain (Yearling Newbery),"Johnny Tremian is a promising young silversmith, lording his position arrogantly over the other two apprentices, until one day, one of them chooses to get revenge. The result is a misfigured hand, causing him to be unfit for work as a silversmith. He makes a friend, Rab, who allows him to take work deliverign papers on a fast but skittish horse, Goblin. Then the American Revolution begins. Rab goes out to fight. And there's a shipment of tea sitting out in the harbour.......What will Johnny do? Will he be successful in surviving the war? Or will he end up like so many others.... dead?This book was definately a good colonial times book for the Revolution. It was a very well-written novel, and I would reccomend it to anyone but fantasy fans, unless they like historical fiction."
3,Not the best book for classroom reading.,"This book was chosen by the book company, Glencoe, to be a fabulous book to introduce children to the beginning of American uprise. After only the 5th chapter both me and my students were bored to tears. Although we finished the text, I would NOT recommend it to any teacher for classroom reading. It is boring and far to indepth reading for children in my age group. Their AR scores on the test were so bad we had to delete them. Even my straight A students failed it. I will make better choices throughout the year!In the books defense however, I would say it is full of history and facts that are worth outside classroom reading for those who are history buffs."
2,"Meh, quite boring...","Now, I understand that this was indeed a good piece of literature. It has some good writing in it. I enjoyed reading the great, vivid descriptions used for many objects and areas. Though all of this is true, there is one thing that ruined this book for me, it's boring. I almost fell asleep reading this. I would rather watch paint dry than read this boring book. This isn't worth the buy unless you're interested in hearing some old lady write a story about the Revolution. This book is mediocre at best. If I were to write a book, I would put the readers interests first."
1,Johnny Tremain is a REALLY bad book!,"At the beginning of 7th grade everybody had to read Johnny Tremain. At first the book was slow but that's how most books are at the beginning so I read on to get to the ""good"" part but it wasn't there! If it hadn't been assinged to us I would have ripped the book up and thrown it away! Half the people in my grade didn't read it because they were hated it and didn't care if they failed the tests, the other half of my grade hated it but read it because they wanted to get good grades on their tests. I would definatly not recomend this book unless you have to read it."
1,Yawn- #1 Most boring book ever,I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!!
1,this book was awful,"I really love revolutionary war books, and after reading the reviews I expected something really good. I read sixty something pages, and I thought it was the worst book I had ever read. It was basically for me 200 pages of nothingness. I really strongly discourage reading this book, so don't waste your time on it.Johnny Tremain was an apperentice silversmith when he burned his hand and had to leave his master. Most of the rest is him wandering around and whining that he wanted to be a smith when he grew up.Do not read this unless you want to be disappointed severely. If you do then go ahead."
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER,"Johnny Tremain is arguably the worst book ever written in the history of the world. The book is about this dumb little boy who burns his hand on some metal and goes into the army to be some stupid little messanger. The book that claims to be great or well written. After about 10 pages the plot is so ""thick"" that you completely lose interest and want to throw the book away. The book does not deserve any awards and should not be recommended for anything. This book definitely should be put on your list to never be bought or never be read. This book is horrible."
4,Johnny Tremain,"The book Johnny Tremain takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, in the year 1773.In the beginning, Johnny Tremain was an apprentice for a silversmith, until he burnt his hand and could no longer work as a silversmith.He later ran into Rab, a Son Of Liberty. Rab showed Johnny how to ride a horse, and he began to be a messenger for Rab. He also becomes one of the many boys and men who threw tea over the side of the Beaver, a British ship with tea.Then, Rab wanted to go fight with the Patriots, and Johnny was very unhappy about that. He heard there was a shooting where Rab was, and Johnny was very worried.Johnny went out to find Rab, and he did find him. He had been shot in the leg, and was dying.Johnny found out that his injured thumb could be fixed so he could possibly shoot a gun,and later it was fixed.The soldiers and many farmers began fighting, and the Revolutinary war began."
4,Johnny Tremain,"I read this book as part of an 8th grade English/Literature/Reading class assignment. I credit the teacher and this book for giving me my life long passion for reading. It was the first book that I ""Could not put down"". It is one book that will change the non-reader's life."
5,Excellent book for 5th graders!,I love this book for my class. We read it together because of the vocabulary. I wish they would make a written edition for the kindle.
3,chapters 1 -3,"In chapters one through three Johnny has changed dramaticlly. He was the most valuable apprentice in this shop. He boss Dove around who was two years older than Johnny. Dove did not like the fact that Johnny was the most valuable apprentice in the shop. In the end of chapter two Johnny's relationship has changed for the worst. He had suffer a terrible burn because Dove gave him the cracked crucible. The roles have reversed at the end of chapter two , Dove Has now become the most valuable apprentice and he bosses him around. After the injury that Johnny suffered he has stayed in the birth and death room for a month , but when it was time for him to go back to his room he did not want to return to the attic with Dove and Dusty. In chapters one through two has begun to mauture into a young man."
3,Not reccomended.,"My opinion is simple: This book is boring. If it weren't for a school assignment, I wouldn't have read it. It never really got anywhere."
2,Not the Best Book,"Hard-to-follow, not too exciting, and it dragged. Forbes' novel is slow-paced and un-realistic. Although it stated great moments in history, the characters are too involved. Johnny is a teenage apprentice, and then he is in war dealing with some of the top revolutionary leaders. Set in revolutionary time, the characters are living in a perfect world and doing ordinary things in the beginning of the book. Then, there is a large leap in the middle of the book and the character's are in war. The book would be much better if the author concentrated on making fictional parts seem more realistic. In that time, people were not as happy-go-lucky. I would recommend this book to people who like a boring historical fiction book."
5,Who are these people?,"It is a sad commentary that a book as long-lived, as rich and readable, and as useful as a window on life in Revolutionary America (albeit only as detailed as appropriate for a young-person's book) is trashed by ""readers"" (if indeed they read the same book I did) whose sub-literate spew is as empty of content as apparently their minds are."
1,Johnny Tremain not recommended,"This book was written well, but the plot was just boring. Awful book to try to read. I don't reccomend it AT ALL!"
1,BAD BAD BOOK!!!!!!,This is one book I could live without. Johnny was an irresponsible brat. I liked it when Pumpkin died. I think the best part was the Boston Tea Party. Cilla and Isannah were by far the worst characters in the book. For your sake don't read the book. Please listen to me.
1,Horrible!!!!!,"This book is the stupidest thing that was ever written. I read it as a school assignment and if it wasn't I would of thrown it away after the first chapter. It was sooo boring, I fell asleep as I was reading it!!"
1,"""An awful, terrible story.""",This book was terrible. It's plot was dumb and everything that happened I had predicted. I would not reccomend it to anyone.
1,This book was horrible!!!!!!,This book was one of the worst fictional books I have ever read!!! If it wasn't for a school assignment I would never have read the boring book!!! It didn't make any sense! Esther Forbes must have had her head in the clouds when she wrote that stupid book.
1,I hated this Book,I HATED this book because it had no purpose. I read many books. But I don't think this book does't have that much of exitement in it. There are many things happening in that book and it doesn't make any sense. And the book had many errors.
1,Disappointing.,"Johnny Tremain is the story of Boston revolting against Britain. I did not like this book because it might have been aimed at a lower reading level. Perhaps I know too much stuff about the American Revolution. I thought it rambled on with no excitement. I would rather learn the history the Revolutionary War by watching Liberty, which is available at PBS."
1,"For Your Own Sake, DO NOT Read This Book","I think Johnny Tremain was a horibble book. I was bored to death with the plot, and I think this is a book that is a waste of time. Even the parts describing the battles were boring. Along with all of my classmates, this book was a waste of time. If possible, I would give this book no stars at all. Don't waste your time, read another book."
1,Not for most people....I think anyway,"I read this is 3rd grade. I thought it was okay. Now I'm in 8th grade. It's required reading. Ok. I didn't remember much of it from 3rd grade so I re-read it. I was horrified by the simplicity of the book. It's got a plot worse than Godzillia vs. Mecha-Godzillia. The moral is pointless. The setting is boring. I hated it. Some...less mature people might enjoy it, but as a novel for YA it's just not worth it."
5,"More than good fiction, more than history.","I am a Dad with an 8 yr old boy. I highly recommend this book for kids from about 8 or 9 through adulthood. This book is not just about Boston and the American Revolution. It is one of the best books I have read about: - real life characters, good and bad. - understanding others, and oneself. - making choices in life. - and, a fair portrayal of a rare event;A small group of Whigs who changed the world for the better.The American experiment was so brilliant that most people in the world still do not understand it. That includes most Americans. Many countries have tried to copy this experiment. Many Americans would like to end the experiment.Johnny Tremain is a powerful book that reminds us that ordinary people created something very extraordinary."
5,Johnny Tremain-Great Teaching Tool for American Revolution,"As a 5th grade teacher of gifted & talented social studies students, I found ""Johnny Tremain"" an excellent tool for teaching the American Revolution. Our textbook is dry and devotes only a small number of pages to this major event in American history. ""Johnny Tremain's"" historial places and characters help readers understand and visualize this important period of time. True, the vocabulary is high level. Teachers need to discuss vocabulary ahead of time. I read the book out loud to my class and discussed each chapter. The extra effort is well worth the final results."
4,Perfect Book,"I thought this book was great. I hated the first few chapters, but when we got into the middle i utterly enjoyed it. I still think this book is not recomended for young readers. There are some parts that an 8-9 year old would not understand. I think this book was very um, powerfully written. I cried at the ending. It made me so happy-sad. This book is ""OK""."
4,The world's best historical fiction!,"Johnny Tremain is about a 16 year old boy who loves adventures he is related to a very rich man named Mr.Lyte. Johnny Tremain's name is really Johnathon Lyte Tremain. His mother was Mr.Lyte's sister so Johnny Tremain is Mr.Lyte's nephew. Mr.Lyte is a mean and grumpy man, but he gets it back in this wonderful story Johnny Tremain. The book has a message too.The message is although you are handycapped/hurt you don't have to act helpless. Johnny didn't so you don't have to either. What is great about the book is that it has a lot of details of what, who, when or where the people are or look like. Although there wasn't any pictures, the details were so good I could picture them in my head. I would probably reccomend this book to adults and readers of the right age."
4,Impossible to put down!,"The moment I began to read Johnny Tremain, I was hooked. The way the author describes the setting and characters makes you feel like you're really there. In fact, this book felt like a window to the past that I could climb through and experiance Boston during the American Revolution.Throughout the whole book, you love the main character, Johnny Tremain. Being a very bright, slightly arrogant, young silversmith, he is immediantly swept into the action of the Revolutionary War. He plays a large part in events such as the Boston Tea Party, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and secreat meetings going on between the Sons of LIberty.The only part of the book that I found was dissapointing was the fact that the book is too short! If you like books with a bunch of action, a little romance, some suspence, and plenty of American history then you should check out Johnny Tremain!"
4,after watching Disney's Johnny Tremain,"This was also required reading for our 5th grade curriculum. Daughter hated it, so about half way through to reinforce it we watched Disney's version of Johnny Tremain on home video. After that, she couldnt read it fast enough. The book filled in all the blanks the movie made for her, and she had faces and personalities to add to the book, along with visual points of reference.In the end, she really enjoyed it."
5,Historic Fiction,"A book that deffinatly belongs on YOUR shelf. A great book about the revolution and the life of a bostonian during the great revolt including, The Boston Tea Party, The Sons Of Liberty, and plenty of action packed battles to keep you begging for more!!!! You won't want to put it down!!!"
4,A very good book,"I had 2 read this book this yr @ skool and at first I was like, this is gonna be the boringest book in the world and then we started reading it and I couldn't put it down! I LOVE IT! IT'S 1 OF MY ALL TIME FAVES! LOL GO OUT AND GET IT!"
4,From a Middle School Student Forced to read this.,"At first I felt a bit bitter about this book. It seemed very slow and I found myself daydreaming about getting to play with mud later that day in art class through most of the first half. After I stopped following along with the oral reading in the class and jumped ahead I found out this book was quite good indeed. I still haven't finished it since I do not own a copy, and will probably be very sad when I do. I do hate how she makes some characters have no redeemable traits whatsoever ::cough::Dove::cough:: but besides that I find this a good book. Although I probably wouldn've never picked it up on my own, I'm glad we were forced into reading it ^_^"
4,Johnny Tremain's a regular boy,"There is a regular boy who gets burned from a dirty trick a kid named Dove plays on him. Now he is handicapped. He struggles through life working for people and does fine on his own, I think, through the bad times of his life. I like this story because it was fun to read. I also thought it was educational."
2,It was dissapointing,"It has a good plot, but the book overal was boring! It could have a little more spice and more entertaining story to it. The charector evolvement was pretty good, but some of it was sort of lame. I wouldn't read it, but my teacher makes me. If you are the type who likes historical fictions, then this is your book. i just dont care for them that much."
2,Middle School Teacher Remembers and Shudders,"My main thought when reading this book in the eighth grade was, ""Why, O why wasn't he a mercurysmith? Might we not have been spared the remainder of the book?"" It was excruciating and I would never put my own students through it, regardless of what wonderful lessons they were supposed to learn. Historical fiction is so often a mixed bag - too many lessons at the expense of literature."
2,This is for 9-12 year olds???,"I read this book, in 6th grade, and I must say that I fell asleep ALOT reading it. My teacher (who is, like, 100 years old) loved it. But if you are thinking about reading this book and aren't a historical-freak, don't."
2,this book bytes the dust!,"This is an extremely boring book.It starts out in some unsucessful silversmith shop where Johnny is basically the breadwinner. Johnny tells Cilla about how he is related to a rich and powerful family, the Lytes. Johnny has an accident, and his thumb becomes fused to his palm on his right hand. from thereon, johnny is a streetrat until he meets Rab, who is a Son of Liberty. The Lytes are loyalists so they get into quite a bit of trouble. Rab dies in the end. I think this is a good book if you aren't forced to read it like I am. Otherwise, its actually a good book for learning about the revolution. I don't reccomend it to those who like comedy books or fantasy, because there's no comedy, and it's based on actual events."
1,This book is not worth a penny,"This book, Johnny Tremain, really is a boring book. It has no sense whatsoever. DOn't read it if you don't have to"
1,Johnny Tremain; who knew it?,"I'm reading this book as an assignment in Language Arts. Last year, we watched the movie, and it was an interesting movie. I thought that this would be a fun book to read, but now that I've really gotten into it, I really don't like it. I'm an advanced reader for my age, and the old English vocabulary is hard for me to tackle. The plot is mostly boring, but there are some exciting parts, such as the Boston Tea Party. There isn't really a plot line, so you never know where Esther Forbes is going next with the story. In other reviews, people have said that its really boring in the beginning, but gets better at the end. This is true in the beginning, but I'm past the middle of the book and this has not changed. If I were feeling generous tonight I might have given this book two stars, because of the few exciting parts, but, because of the main plot, this book only gets one star..."
5,Johnny Tremain,Johnny Tremain is a cool book I'm saying that because Johnny was a boy with a bad hand and was looking for work at a really young age. The thing I liked about Johnny was his bravery he had. Another brave thing he did was go to war when he was really young. This book was the greatest book I ever read in my life. I think you should read this book. I'm not going to give you the ending; I'm leaving that to you to find out. I would tell you one more thing; bravery is necessary.
3,Johnny Tremain,"Johnny Tremain is an average book about a 14 year old boy named Johnny. Johnny is an apprentice silversmith who is proud, and a bit arrogent. His life is dramaticaly changed when his hand is burned with molten silver. I gave Johnny Tremain 3 stars because the plot is a little hard to understand. Johnny Tremain is barely #10 on my top ten wish list. Johnny Tremain is reccomended to people who liked My Brother Sam is Dead."
2,Johnny Tremain,"In the book ""Johnny Tremain,"" a young silversmith apprentice named Johnny Tremain in colonial Boston, 1773, is forced to leave his job after getting his right hand burned very, very badly. Luckily, Johnny finds a new job at The Boston Observer, a newspaper, delivering newspapers and secret messages to members of The Sons of Liberty, which is a secret patriot group that gathers at The Boston Observer.I gave this book two stars for about the first 200 pages were pretty dull. There was a little spark of excitement at about the 50th page. Then it was dull. Then there was another spark at page 200, and after that, it got quite exciting till the end. It left a very powerful message at the end: ""A man can stand up."" I thought it meant that you should be able to get out of whatever you get yourself into. If you want to find out your own opinion, read the book, then think about it."
5,A very good piece of literature.,"I read Johnny Tremain in the sixth grade, and ever since then it has been one of my favorite books. True, it may be a little bit slow sometimes, but all in all it was excellect. In the night I could stay awake for hours longer than usual reading about Cilla and Rab and all the other characters. Even my sister, who is a very picky reader, loved this book. I would give it more than five stars if I could, and I recommend it to readers who enjoy classics. This, in my opinion and hopefully in the opinion of lots of other people, is absolutely a classic!"
3,"OK, Pretty Boring","The main characters, especially Johnny are likeable. Though he is very arrogant and prideful, you can't help but sympathize and like Johnny.The idea of the book is interesting and unlike some ""historical"" fictions, Forbes actually did her research on the Revolutionary War.BUT, the book is fairly boring and the plot thins out in the middle and becomes uninteresting again until the end. But, then the end is not very good either. There are touching moments, but for the most part, it just ends and leaves a lot unanswered and not in a good way that makes you contemplate.Most kids seem to hate it, so I'm guessing you can skip this one for your kids."
3,A Good Book for People Who Enjoy Historical Fiction,"Johnny Tremain is about an apprentice silversmith who injures his hand and is looking for a job he can do with his crippled right hand. When he gets a job at the Boston Observer, a local newspaper, he is plunged into pre-war events. Forbes combined suspense, pre-war events, and interesting characters in Johnny Tremain. Even though Forbes's book has the qualities that I like in a historical fiction book, it also has downsides. Johnny Tremain seems to have a little-kiddies plot, Disney-like plot. The main character has no parents, a mean Great-uncle who despises him, and more Disney-like traits than I can name. I think it was a good historical fiction book, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who dislike slow-moving plots and stories."
3,Needs better handling of voltage spikes,"We have a bunch of these around the house, after a recent remodel. While they're attractive and generally innocuous, they routinely burn out at the same time as whatever light they're connected to. Apparently the voltage spike that sometimes accompanies the ""flash"" of a light burning out fries the dimmer's electronics. So instead of replacing a $1 screw in bulb, I get to replace the $30 dimmer, with all the fun that entails (circuit breaker, wired connections, etc.). The one in our kitchen just burned out for about the 5th time."
5,Like the way this blends in to the other switches,"I have about 5 of these now, and they perform flawlessly. I installed one on a 4-way switch and it works great. I like how they look like all of the other switches. It has a dim orange light inside of it so that you can see it in the dark. Nice dimmer."
2,The DTS track is not worth it,"WARNING, I you do not have a DVD AUDIO player and an dvd-audio compatible amplifier, don't bother with this DVD-AUDIO. The DTS track does not have a discreet LFE (subwoofer) audio track. That's a bummer. That was the whole reason for me to get this item.So if you want some big bass when the canon is lit, forget it ..."
3,Analogue LP had more punch!!,"This is a two-sided disc. The dts side is only 5.0 . My Amp fills in the bass but it is not a discrete .1 channel! Also the cannons near the end are LAME- sounds like snaps of a whip or the crack of a 'cane' on a piece of wood - nothing like my old LP version which had plenty of 'thunderous cannons', only in 2 channel Stereo but with quite abit of ambience providing reasonable surround. This dts digital recording was abysmal!The DVD-A side though 5.1 , sounded 'weak' during the cannon blasts. Really disappointing!!!Edd. iegolden@shaw.ca"
4,Tchaikovsky: 1812 Overture:The New Recording,"Great sounding DVD. The cannons are not as impressive as I thought they would be; have the setup (7.1 THX Cert system), but overall fine audio quality."
3,"Nice, but kinked","The anklet is pretty, has a nice thickness, and it fits well. And it seems like it's generally of good quality. However, the item I received was kinked in two places when I removed it from the box. I may have simply received a damaged item, but beware that this may happen to you as well."
5,Eating since a was a kid!,"Great candy, especially if you love citrus like I do. These have always been one of my favorites, and will stay forever, as long as they are wrapped!"
3,Good info; poor maps,"The narrative is good, flows pretty well, and gives the strengths and weaknesses of FtG as commander. Good overview of the powers and events of the SYW in Europe. Problem is that the maps reproduced here, except for one, are HORRIBLE! Why publisher let a book get the final OK with 90% of the maps entirely too blurry to read is beyond me."
3,Not my favorite,"I hate to knock the Popular Mecanics videos, but I have to a little. On one level they are really well done, but the frenetic feel and the too wise kids, give it a harder edge, imo, than our other videos about rescue or science related subjects. I bought several of these videos and have pushed them to the back, in favor of those with more genuine real characters and a less intense feel. I much prefer Fred Levine's and one we have called ""Kids Love Fire Engines"" made by David and Cameron Barrett. I'll probably resell this one, I'm sorry to say."
4,My son loves it!,Bought when my son turned 4 - he's now 5 and still enjoys watching it. Worth the price. I am always impressed by Popular MEchanics for kids.
4,Dandelion Supports Liver Function.,I think it is a good idea to support liver function whenever taking antibiotics or other medicines processed mainly by the liver. This seems like a good brand at a good price.
5,amazing,"This product is amazing. I have short, weak nails that tear very easily. I have been using this product for a month and now I have strong, long nails. I will continue to use this product and recommend and share with my friends and family. Thank you L.A for creating a great product."
4,Darkly Hilarious,"Divorcing Jack is a hilarious, preposterous romp that ain't gonna be up most folk's alley. It's got a top drawer cast that one wishes, perhaps, were in a slightly better film, but they make the most of the material and often take it up a notch or two beyond where one expects it to go.David Thewlis is terrific as Starkey and he bumbles through plot twists that are almost dizzying. Joining him is a terrific performance by Aussie actress, Rachel Griffiths, who at this point in her career seems capable of doing just about anything. Her gun toting stripper nun bit is priceless.Obviously, from so many negative reactions, Divorcing Jack is not a typical feel good film, but for those who enjoy figuring out the nearly indecipherable, double crossing agents, chase scenes, strippers in nun drag, symbolism, the ongoing situation in Northern Ireland tossed with some bitter, black and often delicious humour, check out Divorcing Jack. You just might surprise yourself!"
4,gloworm,Received by mail in the time frame that was stated. Actually got it earlier then the time frame. Was in great shape. Love all the Reba seasons 1-6
5,Only One Bad Thing About This,The only bad thing about this is that it was the last season of 'Reba'. Five Stars for sure - zero stars for whoever cancelled it.
3,Reba season 6,"Bought the last two season for my niece, she loves the show. I personally think its for the younger crowd because I dont find it funny what so ever. We snatched it up at a good price and shipping was VERY fast."
2,Reba Seasons 5 and 6,"When I got to the last two episodes on each season and disc, they were scrambled and unable to be viewed. Both were defective. I've bought many things through Amazon and these are the first that I have had problems with."
3,Not a complete waste of time,Seemed to be mashed together as the last season. Story lines reused and hurried. No real development....
1,BAD VENDOR/Good Product,"I made the purchase through Amazon.com and the vendor STANDING OVATION shipped promptly. When I received it, I realized I had previously purchased it. I attempted to contact STANDING OVATION to return the product but no return address, no return information, no web address, no nothing available on the Amazon website. I have filed a claim with Amazon so hopefully STANDING OVATION will follow through."
1,A toy,"This looks like a great idea but its to light weight,won't hold up under use. It broke the first time i used it , i didn't even get the first hole drilled. If the drill binds during drilling the cable twists into a knot and its no longer useable."
1,Dissappointed,The first time I ordered the product it came as a keyless chuck and no comparrison to the picture on your website. I returned it and I received the same product as the first time. I threw it away.Eazypower 30167 40-Inch Flexible Drill Extension with 1/4-Inch Keyed Chuck
2,Too fragile,Mine worked for a couple of weeks. I was using it with a 4 inch wire wheel driven by a 1/4 horse motor to remove rust. All was well until it caught on something. It then turned into a pretzel and self destructed. Maybe these need a clutch of some sort to protect them. It's a shame because it's a great idea.
1,GARBAGE,"There is hardly any of the herbs advertised on the box in the actual tea leaves.Jason Winters wrote a book about how this ""Miraculous"" discovery saved him from TERMINAL CANCER.Too bad this same ""Miraculous"" tea didn't help my sister one iota.Sadly we bought this tea out of desperation. It tastes like nothing, really.....and it does NOTHING.What a shame."
3,The phone plate of the hour,"I think the phone plate is sort of a ""loud color"" and many people don't want that sort of thing. So get a new and better color for your viewers to look at ."
2,"""Talking Caller ID"" doesn't talk the Caller ID","Even though ""Talking Caller ID"" is printed right on the unit, it won't actually speak the Caller ID (the phone number of the person calling) to you.If you have recorded a personal name tag for a particular number it will play that, but if you haven't, it just remains mute. You can press ""Review"" later and hear the number announced, but it won't play it while the phone is ringing, which is when you need to hear it."
5,Gillette Atra Plus,Hard to find in the store. I've been using these blades for most of my adult life. I tried the tripple blade and the quad blades and they don't do the job of this double blade. Can't find these in the stores anymore; so I thank goodness for the internet. Excellent product.
4,Interesting Stories,"This book has many interesting stories about the hobo life. Tends to be more about riding trains, which is a little different than olden days when the hobos used the trains to get somewhere usually to work, not just ride the rails.It's still a very interesting read if you are interested in this part of the American experience."
4,"Dated, but basic information","Cars That Changed the Automobile Industry is a decent video. The classic car selections (pre 1960) are more valid than the modern era selections. For example, it lists the Toyota Corona, not the Toyota Camry which arguably has had far more impact on Toyota in the U.S. Likewise, it lists the Jeep Wagoneer, nor the Ford Explorer or even the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which helped kick off the SUV era. It's fun to see some of the older cars, however, and it's a good video to kick off a car discussion. I hope A&E will update this series, since the data in this video dates from 1998."
4,"The Chain sell out,","with pleasant results! While I was offended by the cleanliness and comparative tameness of Automatic when it first arrived, twelve years later, it sounds like a towering pop album that shoulda ranked high on 'best of' lists in 89. The Chain could always write good songs that were listenable, even during the ""Psychocandy"" years-they just chose to wrap it all in torturous feedback and LSD freakouts. Here, they drop the drugs and opt for the jaded love songs. This album feels good, very summery, certainly a happy aberration for the disturbed Reid brothers."
5,You gotta kick it while it's on,"Bought nine records secondhand on Saturday and eight of them turned out to be the wrong trousers altogether--got so blame irritated with Flood by They Might Be Giants I snapped the bleddy thing in half and then, for good measure, in quarters. The disk inside Nirvana's In Utero wasn't quite the Steve Albini-produced stompathon I expected either, but rather a best of Blondie compilation! Sick bag please. The ninth album, this one, I actually own already but couldn't resist getting all over again. Love that U.V. Ray--reminds me of acting the maggot in Sunnyside in Queens for some reason. All twelve tracks motor along though and having two Automatics now doesn't seem the least bit odd to me--in fact I can't honestly say I won't buy this wee beastie again at some point."
3,Brit Com at it's best,"I had seen the originals in the 80's while living in the UK, so being able to buy these oldies for my husband was wonderful. We introduced his family to the Trotter family and everyone laughed once we translated some of the true British phrases. We own another series from an earlier time which is more hilarious. This series sees everyone older, a little wiser and less funny. There are a couple of serious situations that one just cannot laugh about,such as when Raquel's ex returns and she's pregnant by Del. Raquel is a good match for Del, Uncle Albert and 'Dave'.On the whole, the older sets are funnier, maybe because the decor & clothing is less contemporary. The picture and sound quality is fine, although we are not watching in HD. I am glad that the producers knew when to stop. Some of the jokes are getting past their sell-by-date and are below the belt."
3,Reality check,"Lets be honest, Series 7 is a disappointment. Much as I enjoyed the preceding episodes, Series 7 is quite different and something of a ""downer."" It is a darker, more serious set of episodes that I can only attribute to the writers running out of ideas or getting too preoccupied with the relationship issues between Rodney and Cassandra. In summary, fewer laughs, less enjoyable and quite different from the former easy-going style of the previous episodes."
5,Aquí la emoción y el sentimiento son una cosa,"Entre lo máximo de la discografía de Inti Illimani, donde se puede encontrar excelentes instrumentales, boleros, rancheras y mucha grandeza de creación e interpretación, con ganas de avanzar y descubrir, los Inti en su punto máximo"
5,This is the greatest thing that has ever been made by the human race.,"I am an expert on power cords, and I must say that this is definitely a perfect example of exceptional power cord production. There is simply no other power cord known to man that fills this function as well! Not only the perfect function of this cord is a wonder, the NEW AC ADAPTER 2-PRONG POWER CORD FOR LAPTOPS 6' is a TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL!!!!! Under the black plastic of the cord there are two metal wires that carry current in TWO DIRECTIONS. Not only that, the current through this wire is most likely sourced from a wall outlet, common wall outlets supply 120 VOLTS OF CURRENT!!!!!!! This is the greatest thing that has ever come from the human race!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"""Fortune cookie"" advice","While this book has some good bits of advice, there is nothing in which a reader can sink their teeth - there is no substance to the book at all. The chapters consist of 'fortune cookie' sayings that are supposed to guide you into a more successful workplace. How about providing some substance so that readers can really delve into a topic, rather than just being presented with a headline. I 'read' this book in under an hour, and didn't come away with any real words of wisdom, other than to not recommend it to others."
3,"Good for personal growth, not business growth...","I enjoyed this book. One point to make, for those shopping online and who can't thumb through the book. The text is about size 18, and the book could easily be condensed into 50 pages or so. I find the tidbits and stories interesting, the the text itself is very choppy and really just a collection of stories.I think that this book will help my personal growth, and my growth as a leader, but I disagree with the theory that people have to change themselves, and correct managing cannot do that. I wouldn't give the author 5 days running a real business."
2,Needs more!,"I expected a lot out of this book. For me, the book seems to lack substance. While the topic is valid, and everyone needs to follow the intent of this book, the book itself is not a road map on how to get there. There are a couple of nice stories of people who go the extra mile, but if you are not one of those people already, this book is going to guide you to get there.The book came highly reccommended by Dave Ramsey, however, it did not live up to my expectations. Had the book been an article in a magazine, (it can easily be shortened to fit) it would have been worth the price of the magazine. The story was not ready for a stand alone publication."
3,An Interesting Read But At Some Points Ridiculous,"I will start by saying that the book was not bad, in fact it was decent and left me thinking in a more positive manner. The essense of this book is personal responsibility, thinking positively and seeing how you can positively affect a negative situation. I was drawn into the book by the initial story of the waiter who got his manager to go out to the store to buy a soda that the restaurant did not carry. I was turned off by the story of the Home Depot associate who paid for an impatient customers merchandise and then denied a tip later. I think that story boarders on insanity. Trying to take personal responsibility in situations is great but there needs to be a point in which taking personal responsibility does not solve the problem."
5,Best business book I've read in 10 years,QBQ! is a fun book and page after page gives practical advice and guidance for living accountably. Most books are 40% worthwhile and 60% waste. QBQ! is 110% great stuff. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to grow in every area of life.
4,"Excellent, quick/short, must read",Excellent ideas behind this book. The chapters are short and could be expanded upon. VERY fast read. I would include this book on my must read list.
4,Culture of my new department,This is like most corporate books - a very quick read. Even at 140 pages you definitely can read it over your lunch hour.The concept is pretty simple and I have to admit had I read this prior to leaving my last role I might still be there...glad this book waited until I was here. My biggest take away was that you cannot change those others so ask the questions that will help you to determine what you can do to help yourself.
1,Kindle Premium,Why do we pay for our Kindle and then get charged a 35% premium over the price of the print version of this book? Someone needs to get a clue here. I would love to read this book on my Kindle but refuse to pay more for it.
1,Light Popcorn,"This book came highly recommended so I was looking forward to it but ended up very disapointed. First off, this is a very thin, large font, tons of white space excuse for a book - there is very little to it and it isn't worth 5 bucks much less the list price of 20. The book is fluffy, trite and idealistic at best. The entire gist of the book is covered here in the Amazon description and all the value is there as well - no need to buy the book. Skip this one."
1,Disappointingly trite,"Reading QBQ is not difficult. It can be done in less than two hours (time it takes to roll one's eyes included).The premise is that employees need to be responsible... for everything. If employees do not perform... it's their fault. The employer has no part in this. Employees need to stop making excuses, stop being lazy, stop procrastinating, stop pointing fingers, put up and shut up. Most important, employees need to stop asking questions. If they do ask questions, they need to answer it themselves by taking responsibility for their own impotence.This must be music to irresponsible managers ears that will be happy to hire the author to give two day courses. They have no part in it. It is the employees fault."
5,Teaching you to ask what you can do for your company...,"I read this book for the first time a little over a year ago. At the time, I tried to soak in the message, but since I thought it didn't really apply to me, I think it went in one ear and out the other, so to speak.Fast forward to today. This book is required reading for my work, and I read it a little more closely this time around. As it turns out, this little book is jam-packed with morsels of good advice. It's all about using a JFK-esque philosophy: ask not what your company can do you for you but what you can do for your company. You can insert almost any words you'd like to replace ""company"": team, client, etc. The whole point of the book is encouraging people to take a moment to think before placing blame. Instead, look in the mirror first and see if YOU can resolve the issue instead of passing the buck as we are so wont to do in this society."
5,Must read!,THE definitive book on personal accountability. This is one of those books I have purchased for friends and co-workers - it is that life changing.
4,Reviews Paid Off,"...This book is not a heavy read. Finished it in an hour and a half on plane with a meal. It heavily uses annecdotes to make it point. The gist of what it talks about is how you frame your question impacts your outcome. Many people frame their questions in the first person (I or me)and in the reference of victimhood, e.g. ""Why does (fill in the blank) happen to me?""Through the annecdotes, the author tries to teach you to frame questions that empower people to take charge and responsibility for their actions and situations.This is a good book for managers and subordinates."
1,One of the worst.,"This is one of the worst self help books I have ever read. It states that ""QBQ works because it's based on the truth ""I can only change me"". This statement is a complete falsehood. While I am responsible for my actions, what I do can influence, and change, the behavior of others. In the new right-wing politically correct environment we are in this book might make people feel good, but it offers nothing in terms of new ways of thinking, tools one can use to improve oneself, or ways to figure out how to improve a process. It requires no effort and results in no paradigm shifts in thinking. It runs counter to most Lean Manufacturing ideas and methods if one is working in a production environment. Stick with ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" if you are really looking to do some soul searching."
2,about 1 page of real material.,"i really don't know why people love this book so much. it has about 1 real page worth of advice, with the rest being stories and platitudes. it basically says that in all cases, even where other people clearly drop the ball, you should do your best. one other review that states ""Basically this book tells how to blame yourself for what others fail to do"" is exactly right. there's got to be a better way to approach the topic of accountability without being such a doormat."
2,QBQ,"I found QBQ to be very elementary reading. I read the book in an hour and found a couple of tidbits worth remembering. I was very disappointed overall in the book. For a manager looking for ideas it was little more than trite, rah, rah material. Because of the ease of reading and time spent reading it, you may find it worthwhile."
3,QBQ - Not bad,"This was required for my Human Relations class and it was a really nice change from the normal reading. It was quick reading, to-the-point instruction on personal accountability. While I agree with the concept, I don't think it was convincing enough for those who do not take responsibility for their actions.If you a new outlook or focus on improvement, personal accountability is the first and most important change you can make. And this is a good start!"
4,Quick read!,I bought a copy of this book for each of my six sales representatives. I read it in about an hour and I hope each of my reps do the same. I hope each of them learn to act on what they can control instead of complaining about what is out of their hands.
3,The silent conversation in your mind,"QBA is about the conversation taking place in our subconscious mind. Are we asking ourselves ""What & How"" questions (i.e.: ""How can I improve my performance?"" or ""What can I do to improve my performance?"" or the other bad questions that lead us into a self-fulfilling cesspool of pity?"
1,"Overpriced, Under-delivered","DO NOT BUY ON KINDLE. Takes 20 minutes to read, is way overpriced. The information can be gleaned in about 3 minutes. The other 17 minutes are facile examples. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Very disappointed,"I heard the author on the radio and thought this would be a very good book. I was very disappointed. It is short, some chapters are one paragraph and it has large font. It has some nice thoughts, but it is way over hyped. Save your money."
3,Basic Accountability Book,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. It came highly recommended but it was very basic information on practicing accountability. If you are just starting out in your career or job, this would be a great book. Seasoned professionals will find it too basic. I have the audio CD and it is read by the author who does a good job; it held my attention for the most part. With that said, I wish everyone in the world would practice what this book preaches...I guess I'll take accountability for that and do it."
5,Finding accountability!,"Not only did I get the book, but I recently listened to him speak at a function in Keystone. He was actually daring enough to say something most are afraid to say: accountability is an individual activity, not a team sport! Whether we're talking about the foreclosure crisis or personal happiness. I used the question he suggested about having employees give one suggestion on how to improve the company. He was right... most answers started with a ""P"": product, pricing, policies, people. Only one suggested that it starts with ""Me""! Great ideas on how to bring personal accountability awareness into the office enviornment using a logical, nonthreatening approach. But the one that learned the most was ME!"
3,Longer than it needed to be,"Don't get me wrong, the ideas in the book were good ones, but it felt like all the supporting text simply rehashed the ideas over and over. The chapters were uncommonly short, sometimes only a paragraph at a time, which could be a good thing or an obnoxious thing, depending on your view. And while we're on the topic of short things, the entire book itself can be read through in a matter of a couple hours. It's very small. Perhaps my problem was that I just sat down and read the whole thing at once. Perhaps if I'd taken a chapter at a time over a few days it would have felt less like stretching the good points out to make a book."
5,Timeless Information.,From begining to end this book gives you lessons that are timeless. Read the book from front to back and then keep it handy when you need to freshen up on your own personal accountability. It is a quick read with alot of hard hitting points. I browse through the book once a month to keep myself motivated on the only person I can change (ME).
5,Very effective book,"I am involved in a marketing business, and our leaders bought a QBQ! book for each person in the company. QBQ! has really opened my eyes as to how to get things done in my life. The stories are terrific, it reads fast, and when I put it down I picked it right back up and read it again. The short chapters allowed me to read and put it into action and then go back for more."
5,Yep,"Love it. This is a replacement copy. I give this book away on a semi-regular basis. Fast service, good product."
1,What a waste!!!!,"This is a complete waste! Complete waste of time and money. This is for weak managers who are afraid to manage. The author wants managers to tell all of your subordinates, ""Don't ask why"". The message is do your job and don't worry when others (including managers) don't do their jobs! This is the type of training all worthless employees have been waiting for.If you follow this training, the next time you hear ""Why"" will be from your family member asking why did you company go out of business!"
3,Cliches and bumper sticker slogans,"Not that the stories are not cute, but this book was filled with cliches and bumper sticker slogans. This wasn't a ""how-to"" or motivational at all. The 1 page chapters were too short to identify with the subjects. I guess some of the stories could be used in speeches...I would suggest you browse this book at the library before buying. Fortunately it does not take long to read through this book."
2,Little content,"The book contains some excellent stories to illustrate the need for accountability and excellent examples of how accountability works. However, there is no process given on how to achieve it. The author basically recommends a change in attitude. Frankly, I don't need a book to tell me that."
1,My opinion of QBQ,My opinion is that QBQ is a book of full obvious writings. I am a little shocked that the book's content is so obvious and simple. Perhaps the book is aimed at younger kids?
5,Quick read with a lasting message,"I got QBQ in the mail two days ago, and I have already read the book twice! Every time I read it I found a new nugget of useful information. The book is very easy to read, the chapters are concise and to the point. To me that means each word has a purpose. The stories that John use to prove his point stay with you, and then John does a great job in connecting all the stories at the end.If you are looking for a book that WILL transform your life, your work, and your business this is the book for you."
1,Sub par book,"There is no flow to this book and to call it a book I feel is misleading. I would describe it as a collection of random quotes and phrases accompanied by a short story to demonstrate the point. All you need to know is right on the cover: Eliminate blame, complaning, and procrastination to work towards personal accountability."
5,Amazing!,"I loved the book, it really gets you to think about how you question your judgmental thoughts and not even knowing they were judgmental to begin with!"
5,QBQ,A great book for self improvement in several categories of your life. I would highly recommend everyone having this on their bookshelf.
5,"Easy, practical, powerful","I was introduced to the concept and power of personal responsibility about 17 years ago and have been a proponent and student of it ever since.I was introduced to QBQ! by John Miller somewhat over a year ago.What I've found to be true about John's premise is that it is easily integrated into a personal or corporate philosophy.It has diminished blame, built, finger-pointing and generally feeling badly about things.Using the principles has been personally and professionally liberating.I've introduced the book to friends and clients over the past year with results being uniformly positive.I recommend the book to anyone out to support themselves and others in having a life that works."
1,Not value for money,"I am always looking for good sales books to read and was handed QBQ at my work. Unfortunately, and in my opinion, this book's content is too shallow and obvious. I find that the texts and thoughts are really elementary and rudimentary.I also am disappointed by the short length of the book."
2,The motive behind the QBQ,"The book reads easily, partly because most of what it has to offer almost everybody already knows. That being said, there are some worthwhile thoughts embedded in it, and it can be read in an hour, so there's not much to lose.My biggest problem with the book is that Miller's impliicit definition of ""personal accountability"" is not distinct from responsibility and therefore loses all of its power, especially as a business requirement. Yet, the subtitle of the book is ""practicing personal accountability at work and in life"", and, sorry, you can't practice accountability if you don't know what it is...Oh, and the phrase ""personal accountability"" is a redundancy -- there is no accountability other than that which is personal."
2,Just buy Flipping the Switch by Same Author,Just buy Flipping the Switch by same author. It gets to the same point with a better word picture.Great gift for whiners and complainers.
1,Please stop!,"I had the pleasure (snick snick) of seeing this band live at a Tilly and the Wall concert. I have to say it, they were awful! Yes the band is from Sweden and play horns... but so do a lot of bands before for them. They are unoriginal and not even good abstract art. The lead singer just stood there looking at the corner of the wall and attempting to sing - which sounded more like screaming. Everytime they paused between songs people said under their breath ""thank God! please let that be the last one"". Being very open to the arts and different things I decided to try their musical cd. Wow, not a difference in any sense. I would pass up on this band as this is going to be a one hit wonder if that. If you are looking for something similar I recommend Tilly and The Wall and Pony Up! from Canada.Blah to this band!! ugh.."
4,One of the best PSP games,This game is really a treat. I was a huge fan of the old Syphon Filter games on the PS and this one continues the legacy.
4,One of my first PSP games and one of my favourites,"I really enjoyed playing this game. It is similar in game play and style to splinter cell but not nearly as complex which is good for the PSP. Story is a little cheesy but whatever, I was stuck at my aunt's house with no laptop and no tv for a few days so this was an excellent way to pass the time and I was so hooked I finished it in 2 days."
5,Arbuckle's makes great coffee,"I have kept these foil packages in the freezer for up to a year and gotten perfectly fresh coffee when I ripped it open. I use one pack per 8 cups of water for regular strength and 2 packets for 10 cups water for stout coffee. Never have had a complaint one when I serve this up.I tend to keep a box of Breakfast Blend and one flavored on hand for those days where there just isn't time or inclination to measure out spoonfuls... C'mon - we all have days like that, right!! :)For taste, convenience and shelf life, I highly recommend!All the best,Jay"
3,"For being a classic, this book is so-so.","This book was OK. It kept my attention and was really easy to read, but I wasn't blown away. It's probably a good read for a first Agatha Christie experience, but it definitely didn't make me want to read more of her books. I would recommend it to someone who wants to read something quickly and not have to think too much. I liked the character development and the final scene."
5,The best,"This was the first Agatha Christie novel I had the pleasure of reading. I loved it so much, I proceeded to own and read EVERY one of her other books (80+ including short story compilations). It is still my favorite. If you want to read a classic, this is it."
2,not too bad but i've read better,"the beginning of the book is boring until you get to the middle were it gets a better but not much the ending wasn't as clever as Agatha Christie is known for but the alibi's for all the characters are cool. the detectiveHercule Poirot isn't close to being as good as Sherlock Holmes. This is a letdown compared to ""And then there were none"" but agatha is still cool but if i was you i wouldn't read this instead of reading stuff by Bernard Cornwell or other books by The Queen of Crime!"
1,Get the paper version instead,"This ebook was horrible.Words ran together, and if that wasn't enough, entire lines of text were missing. How is one supposed to enjoy any book, much less a mystery novel, when parts of it are missing?"
2,Really People? You Didn't Know?,"I read this book because I felt silly claiming to be a big reader and never having read an Agatha Christie mystery. Do I dare say I'm disappointed? I knew the end less than halfway through so reading the whole thing was perfunctory. Luckily, it's fairly short. Instead of keeping me on the edge of my seat it had me sliding off as I struggled to not doze off. I know it's a classic, a trendsetter by a truly original and insanely successful author, but I'm sorry. I wasn't wowed. Perhaps I haven't made enough of an investment in her creation. After all I've only gotten to know Hercule Poirot in the context of one story. I might give him--and her--another chance, but not likely any time soon."
1,not new,"The book was perported to be ""NEW"" - it was not. It's in fairly good condition, but the pages are brownish in color and there are many creases in the book. Not happy"
1,Terrible!,"I have read this book, and found it boring, and unentertaining. The mystery elements involved are nothing new, and the ending is lame. If I could give this less stars, I would. Perhaps if there had been a plot twist, or maybe an exciting scene, or a further explanation of the murderer (the solution(s) still dont seem to explain all). I hated this book, and would not reccomend it to anyone."
1,Horrible,"This book was very confusing and hard to read. It didn't give you a lead on who the murderer was so you weren't really into the story so much that you didn't want to put it down. I wouldn't reccomend this book, but I had to read it for school."
1,i thought this book was bad monkeyman it had a bad ending,"It was an okay book but Monkeyman it had a bad ending and at least to me Monkeyman that is the most important part Monkeyman it was however complex even though i had a slight idea Monkeyman of who it was the entire time Monkeyman the beginning of the book is EXTREMELY boring Monkeyman so boring i almost skipped the first few chapters Monkeyman i dont suggest reading it i know agatha christie is considered the Monkeyman Queen of Crime but this book definitely did NOT get her that title Monkeyman but still i guess it was fairly okay Monkeyman i am friends with Stinky Mc Chucklehead Monkeyman I like cheese too, and stinkies are yummy especially with Monkeyman bananas bananas bananas Monkeyman"
4,Revisiting a Classic,"Ms. Christie had a clean, crisp writing style that suits this genre very well. There are no flowery prose to be found in-between the covers of this mystery. It has been over 30 years since I read 'Murder on the Orient Express' while in high school and I still clearly remember the unusual outcome. But despite knowing the surprise ending, revisiting this classic and observing Ms. Christie's remarkable ability to place clues and red-herrings throughout made me appreciate her talents even more. As usual, another great, entertaining read by a master of the whodunit."
4,My Review of The Murder on the Oriental Express,"Murder on the Oriental Express is a fantastic book. It starts out with world famous Hercule Piorot becoming supicious of a young lady who said she was a governess. Piorot tried to book a train, but it was almost entirely filled when at least he got a bunk. Shortly, the train gets stuck on a snowdrift and cannot move for a day or too. However, something of greater worry is that someone has been murdered, and is still on the train.This wonderful mystery makes you look at every possible clue, every hint, every detail, and there is still no answer. Hercule struggles too, the suspect could be anyone on the train, but then he realizes, maybe the answer is right under his nose."
3,"not the most exciting, but one of the cleverest endings yet","Poirot boards a train that gets stuck in the snow, far from any outside help. Someone is murdered. Poirot must solve the crime!Because the book takes place in just one place, it's a little less action driven than some of the others (even than some of the good ones, likeThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd, not just the terribleThe Big Four). But the ending is oh-so-clever and rather delightful. I was very pleased with Poirot's tenth published outing. (I admit I haven't read his 7th, the play Black Coffee, but I've read the others.)"
3,Classic,"Classic Agatha Christie -- nearly to the point of being campy, but remaining entirely charming. I love the way her writing moves through stages that seem to pull in even the most experienced mystery/detective readers, presenting each possible conclusion as perfectly acceptable before revealing the next twist. In the isolated setting of a snowed in railway, she does a great job of pulling you first to one conclusion and then the next, all of which ultimately pale in comparison to the big reveal-scene. And of course, her characters -- as always -- are wonderfully illustrated and never fall too-neatly into the generic roles of their genre. Christie's writing never dates itself as far as technique is concerned, and I don't think her contributions to detective fiction are ever likely to lose their charm."
3,Murder on the Orient Express,As I said elsewhere I am not a Hercule Poirot fan. I bought it because this was made into a movie. But unlike my experience with Death on the Nile. I could not get into this book. I saw the movie but I could not hear them or see them as I read. It was different.
3,It was ok......,This book was definitely not my most favorite book but it was alright. It was very slow in certain parts of it but at other parts it really sped up & I was very interested. I also thought it was too organized & it made me think very hard but over all I really did like the book.
5,An outstanding read,"This is the greatest mystery book I ever read. It has a magical ends, it seems unbelievable, but actually followed tips really well."
2,A Let Down,"This book just didn't do it for me and I believe it was because of the writing style, which can best be described as ""no-frills."" There was little to no description in this book, it used as few words as possible. I needed more elaboration in order to see the scene, the characters, etc. I also thought that the structure of the book was too ""fill in the blank."" By this I mean that the book lacked transitions and it was as if the various parts of the book were written independently of one another and then were strung together at the end."
2,Okay,"Okay this was probably my least favourite Agatha Christie book. I am a great fan of hers, but I have to say this book sort of dissapointed me. I found it boring. 18 chapters in total were all just Poirot interviewing the suspects. And I didn't find the end surprising at all. To me, there wasn't any climax, and all in all it was pretty boring. I really don't see why this book is so popular. Some of my favorites are Easy to Kill, And then there were none, and N or M."
2,Murder of Confusion,"Murder On the Orient Express was a story about a detective by the name of Hercule Poirot. While he was on a train going to London, a murder occurred, and he was asked to step in to try to solve it. With every person on the train a suspect, you'll never believe the twisted ending.My opinion of the book was that I didn't like it very much. The plot was simple, but it got confusing for me with all the different characters that were involved. It was difficult for me to understand, and keep everything straight. I most certainly didn't enjoy it. I would not recommend this book, unless you want to be bored to death."
3,Not much...,"It was my first time to read this about a week ago, yeah I know I am a loser. Although I know that this is very famous in its own right, still I did not have any idea about it. However, when I read about it I was kinda disappointed about it for I was expecting a LOT from it. Well, its bad enough that the plots goes a little bit dragging for my taste but to think that it is very famous makes it all the more dreadful.The ending I was hoping for was not there. If you love mysteries and go on reading it for it not be solved that much, it would be FRUSTRATING right? Hmm I hope I made a point here."
5,Talk about an ending with a twist!,I have read over half of Agatha Christie's books and this is by far one of the best with a COMPLETELY unexpected ending.
3,Poirot,"I love trying to figure out the whodunnit and Agatha Christie does it pretty well. After watching the TV series, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had stuck pretty well to the book, with a few changes."
4,An Excellent Mystery With An Excellent Ending,"Agatha Christie does a wonderful job, and this book is a good one. Definatly worth to read. The setting and plot are extraordinary as well as the colorful suspects. The murder solution is ingenious but a bit far fetched. Poirot is delightful in this book and the way he deals with the crime is great and there are various themes presented. Pick this one up."
4,Murder on the Orient Express: a great book,"The Murder on the Orient Express is a book that fascinates everyone who reads it. If you like suspicion and are curious, that book has a great story. On the trip in train Orient Express there are 14 people going to Paris and one person is killed and everyone becomes suspected. It is your job to go over the book and have a great time reading trying to find out who is the murderer. It is a very interesting book because after each chapter you will be changing your opinion about WHO DID IT? Hercule Poirot is a very good detective that was on the train. With his great strategies he reveals the real murderer."
4,Guess who! Be a detective yourself~!,"I have read this book when i was very young. It was just for fun then. I read this book when i'm 24 now, for fun again. But it is very different feeling i have between when i read this book when i was a kid and i read this in the age of 24.this book is mystery. And I think this book deserves to be called the 'Mystery'' There are several passengers in an unusually crowded oriental express train. Somebody is killed in the train. There seems nobody came into the train. It means the murderer is still in the train! Let's see how Mr.Poirott, the detective, finds the murderer. And be a detective yourself, too."
4,"very interesting, very confusing in some parts","This has to be one of the best books I have ever read!! Although it was very confusing toward the end, that requires you to use your brain more therefore letting your mind expand"
4,"Entertaining, but mildly lacking","I enjoyed the novel. It seems, however, a typical mystery novel. The idea was wonderful, but the element of the ""sleuth"" interviewing all parties involved, has been done."
3,murder on the orient express,"The book Murder on the Orient Express is a good book with many unexpected occurances. The Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot , is on a train ride when a murder happens. The killer is unknown and Poirot has no leads because all passengers have well- developed alibis. The man murdered was an American businessman that was stabbed twelve times and because of heavy snowfall on the trip, the train was stopped. Since the train was stopped the murder was still on board. The detective had only three clues to work with. He then began to find many of the passangers on board knew more than they told. The killer is quite ironic and very hard to guess. As usual, Herule Poirot found the killer and the Simplon Orient Express returned to its station with the killer caught."
4,Great Book!!,"This is one of Christie's finest books. With a great plot, it's one you can't put down. If you pay very close attention, you will probably figure it out.Also Recommended: And Then There Were None"
5,One of Christie's best!,"One of Christie's characteristics is that she likes to keep you guessing while trying her utmost to surprise you. The cleverness with which Poirot solves this case at the request of M. Bouc is amazing. This was one of the first Christie's I'd read over 20 years ago, and it made me a fan for life. This is a ""must read"" for any murder mystery fan; I believe it is my favorite of all her works."
3,So-so....,"Murder on the Orient Express may be Agatha Christie's most famous book, and it's said to be the greatest of all of her novels. And that's why I was so disappointed.I've read a number of Agatha Christie's, and I've got to say, this is my least favorite. Now I love Hercule Poirot, and I think the whole idea of it is great, a murder on a train, and nobody able to escape. And while the solution is good, I just wasn't satisfied in the end.The best thing I can say without giving the whole thing away is if you're the kind of person who reads a mystery with high-hopes of figuring it out, stay away from this one."
4,My first Agatha Christie book.,"Definitely enjoyed this one. No way to figure out in advance how it's going to end. As the book went on, I started thinking that the plot was extremely implausible, but all was explained at the end and it wrapped up quite nicely."
5,Quite Possibly the best Mystery of Our Time,"'The Murder on the Orient Express' by Agatha Christie is the best mystery, and my second favorite book, next to Harry Potter. The author makes the story start as the 'run of the mill' old Mysteries. ""This guy goes_____. Then he recieves a call from _____. Now he needs to go to..."" Then the story becomes twisted. Read the book to see the story unfold. This book I would recommend to people 10+ because the language is suited for the early teens and not before. I also like this publication company."
5,Great movie for my daughter to enjoy,This is definitely a Disney classic. Great movie to add to my collection! Can't wait to see the second one!
3,Disney Fails Again!,"I should have read the reviews before buying this Blu-ray set. I am so disappointed that the song ""If I Never Knew You"" was again removed from this wonderful film. Why would Disney back-pedal by only offering the edited verions of this film? Sure, go ahead and offer the original version, but also offer the restored version with this wonderful song included back into the film and not as a ""Deleted Scene"". How hard would that have been? The work of restoring the song back into the film was already done with the 10th anniversary DVD release. Sometimes I just don't understand why these obviously poor decisions are allowed to follow through at Disney; ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" debacle being another case in point. Also, what's with stacking the discs on top of each other in the case? How cheap can you get?!"
5,Pocahontas Two Movie specail,"Looooved both of these shows as a kid, so glad to be able to share these memories with my own children. :)"
2,Horrible Package,Got this set & Disney Cheaped out by stacking 3 Dvds on top of each other. They used to be really good by separating the disks. Now have to go buy a case for this to separate them.
2,If I Never Knew You,"Very disappointed they once again cut ""If I Never Knew You."" Who cares that it's included in the supplements! The fact that it's not in the actual film is so frustrating and ridiculous. Why are the people at Disney so clueless???"
5,Great Disney Bluray Transfer,"My family has been purchasing all the Disney movies on bluray as they come out. The quality of this bluray is very good and HD quality. For the price you get two movies, Pocahontas and Pocahontas 2. Normally Disney would release two separate movies however it was nice getting a deal with both movies included. Even if you don't have kids I would suggest getting this movie while you can. With the Disney Vault it hard to say when it will be released again."
3,Not fave Disney but still good.,"Actually, I prefer the raccoon in this to every other character, and I personally would rank this with SLEEPING BEAUTY as just OK Disney-gorgeous to look at, but a little dull."
4,Classic Disney,"This movie makes my ""short list"" of favorite Disney films. The story is good, if stylised, the music is great, the animals don't talk, (even if the tree does), and Pocahontas gets the award for Best Hair. A perfect family film."
2,Fabulous movie but AWFUL packaging!,"I'm going to start off by saying that the 2 star review is NOT for the movie itself - although I really cannot stand Pocahontas II and wished that this was just the first movie. I pre-ordered this movie and received it 1 day after release (talk about fast shipping!).Now this is advertised as a 3 disc combo pack. Imagine my surprise when I open the case up and see only 2 discs with no extra space for a 3rd. I pulled out the Pocahontas DVD and there underneath was the Pocahontas II DVD! Now I don't know about you, but I'd definitely prefer my discs to be in separate spaces! I'm definitely not okay with this set up. I'm half tempted to throw away the Pocahontas II DVD since in my mind that movie doesn't exist. But as I paid for it, I'll keep it. I guess I'm just going to put it in a separate jewel case so as to not scratch my Pocahontas DVD."
5,Pocahontas,This is a beautiful film that celebrates the life of Pocohantas and her values as well as the values of Native Americans.
3,Movie good...Case broken,"The Blu-rays are very nice; however, the Blu-ray case was broken on arrival. Broken case broken case broken case broken"
3,Pocahontas is fantastic. The sequel makes me die a little inside.,"Pocahontas is magic, but wish the deleted song ""If I Never Knew You"" was restored into the film like in the 10th anniversary edition. It adds so much to the overall story. Pocahontas II fell into the same trap that the Fox and the Hound II did. Terrible story, terrible supporting characters and terrible music. The songs in the sequel sounded like a child wrote them. The ending was unforgiveable and the main characters weren't themselves. I'll never watch it again."
2,The second film is terrible,"I think that add the second film at this version in blu ray of Pocahontas is a mistake. The second film is terrible, with a really cheap animation and terrible style. The first film is amazing, but it's really sad that there's not ""If I never knew you"" included in the film. And another mistake is the absence of a new making of, like ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Lion King"".."
2,ugh,"my second least favorite disney movie. only behind the black cauldron. poor plot arc, unlikeable characters, crap ending. Seller was A+ but this is one of the worst disney movies"
5,Netflix beat Christmas wrapping,"I was very excited to get these two moives for my daughter for Christmas. Then just a few days before Christmas, I was surfing the Netflix titles and these both came up. I then had to deside how many and what moves do we really need to own. These almost made the cut, but didn't. I sadly returned them, and my daughter has watched both moves on Netflix streaming about three times each. Times they are a changing."
4,"Good history, interestingly done","This movie is great for learning the early history of our country. I bought it for my 5 year old granddaughter. It has just a little too much shooting in it for a 5 year old, and the part with the bear was too intense. But it would be perfect for a 7 year old, and adults will appreciate the attention to details."
1,BLU-RAY more like DVD,This title is already officially released on blu-ray by Disney in Australia. I am very disappointed in the picture quality. It looks not much different to the dvd version I already own. I am starting to question all of these bluray releases and if it is worth re-purchasing titles when there is not much difference to the previous dvd release. Anyone else concerned??
3,half worth it,"I LOVE Pocahontas, I remember carrying around my little Pocahontas backpack in kindergarten. Then about 10 years later I get around to watching the 2nd movie. Look at other reviews for this movie, it's horrible. I would write why but I don't want to put spoilers. Like I said, read other reviews on it.http://www.amazon.com/Pocahontas-II-Journey-Classic-Collection/dp/B00004R99U/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid;=1339296164&sr;=8-9I like the combo pack idea though. :)"
1,Disappointed,Though the magazine looks great-we have not received our first issue which should have come 1 month ago. I have sent 2 communications concerning this and have heard from no one.
3,Very random,"I was a little disappointed in this magazine. The pictures are nice, but the content seems very random. There are activities aimed at the very young (ie. same and different, color recognition) and then there are some complex concepts that can't hold a toddler's attention (ie. match the letter to the picture that starts with it). It is very short for a bi-monthly, and doesn't offer a lot of stories to read -- usually just one about that month's animal. My daughter does like the tear out animal cards in each issue."
5,Great!!,"As an educator and mom of a 3 year old, this magazine rocks! My 3 1/2 year old LOVES it! It is highly engaging. She loves to read it over and over and at this age, and as a developing reader, that is what she should be doing. The age range (3-6) is actually perfect. This product is not meant to send you kid to a corner and keep them quiet for an hour. There are fabulous activities that build reading readiness and help emerging reader. To get the full value out of the magazine make sure you are reading it with your child, and using the guides (such as the questions) to interact and educate your child! Also, there are NO ADS in this magazine....ther is a subscription card, but that is easily taken out and thrown away or passed on to a friend!"
1,"Disappointed , Very Little Content!","Just got this in the mail today for my 4 year old. I am suprised to see such a high quality magazine, put out such a low quality ""kids"" version!This magazine is writen for 3-6 year olds, but I think it's more suitable for 1-2 year olds. The average length of an ""article"" in this magazine is 2 pages long (no page turning required), and consists of 3-4 sentences!The actual size of this magaize of this magazine is about half the size of a normal magazine (it's only 6.5""X 7""). Very thin too, only 24 pages (turn the page 12 times and it's over), and the content is very random!I called to cancel and they said they would refund the full amount. Would not recommend this to anyone."
3,It's more like a pamphlet than a book/magazine,"There were fun games and good facts for little kids to know, but I was very surprised at how little it is. It seems more like a small advertisement for National Geographic than a magazine for little kids. Disappointed at that since it costs a lot more for a subscription to the Little Kids publication than for any other National Geographic publication."
2,National Geographic Little Kids,"I am really disappointed and I haven't even reviewed the content. First, it was supposed to be sent to my goddaughter's son, not me. It came to me (even tho I worked with Amazon to clear of the subscription address) and I almost tossed it before looking at it. It looked like a piece of junk mail at first and quick glance. Frankly, I think it was a lot of money for something that is very cheap in appearance. Now I have to call Amazon again to find out whether the little boy this is intended for will get it AND tell the parents to watch for a cheap looking flyer that is a publication of the National Geographic Society. Very miffed by this."
2,Almost mistook it for junk mail!,"So disappointed in the quality of this ""magazine""- we almost threw it by accident when our first issue arrived. It looked like a piece of junk mail! It's about 5x6, Target sales catalog quality pages, and slightly longer than a pamphlet you might get full of coupons!!We bought this as a gift for our son and a couple of his friends for their birthday and we are totally embarrassed. Definitely NOT worth $3 an issue!!! We expected sooooo much more from National Geographic.We gave it two stars because atleast there was some fun activities in the booklet. It came with some tear apart animal cards, but they are such poor quality material (not cardstock) they don't last long in the hands of a 3 year old.Total bummer NG!"
3,It's small (and cheaper elsewhere),"I have to agree with other reviewers - this magazine in really small. And I don't mean that it doesn't have many pages, although that's also true. Its dimensions are also small - around 4"" X 6"". It's just a really small magazine in every sense. My daughter does enjoy it, but for the price, you'd expect something that had both more and larger pages. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, you can find it cheaper at places other than Amazon (as of Feb 2009).If you want some cool nature pics and games for your kid and have a few bucks to blow, go ahead. But don't get it from Amazon."
2,overpriced,"I think this is overpriced. If the price was lower, or if the issues came weekly, then it would be fine. I paid fifteen dollars for six issues and I feel like I got taken advantage of. Not what I expected from National Geographic."
4,Great pre-schooler magazine,"My daughter has been recieving this magazine since they started printing it a little over a year ago. She loves animals, so this is perfect for her. There are very short factual stories about various animals and countries in each one, as well as some games - counting, matching, rhyming, that sort of thing. Its very good quality - we keep them like books (unfortunately not quite as sturdy as a paperback book, but they do last pretty well). She loves the animal 'trading cards'that come with each one - she has quite a collection of animal cards now and they are very special to her.My only complaint is that it only comes every 2 months - which is a LONG time for a preschooler to wait for the next book. I wish it were monthly. It is a bit pricy (over a couple dollars per magazine), but they are very well done and I like not having advertising in the magazine."
4,"4 year old loves it, cheaper at National Geographic website","My son is now 4.5 years old and really likes it. I agree with others that is not a super long magazine, but the photos are GREAT the wording is simple and large enough to easily read (if you have an early reader its ideal) and it comes with wild cards in each issue, which my son loves to rip out and collect. The activities are all things you can easily do at home without tons of prep. Overall very happy, however, I paid $10 less by ordering direct from the nat'l geographic website vs amazon."
5,Heaven forbid...,"...a band try to be original. Never really meets with approval, people like their usual old. Im giving Temple of Shadows five stars because I think reviews by some tasteless people have been far too unfair. I think this new style sits angra great. It needs some polishing, of course, but I think its a great start and this cd is fantastically different. There may have been one or two songs (no more) that I havent enjoyed, but for the rest its definitely worth it. But this isnt the only great album by this group, every single one i've bought I've enjoyed, and that is very rare for me. About the ""brazillian"" influences in some of their songs: dude, if you don't like them, you can go dig yourself a grave that says ""here lies an uncultivated person"""
5,Unbelievable,"I listen to a LOT of music. This album was immediately slotted into my Top 10 Metal Albums of All time the *first* time I ever heard it. I am stunned, and blown away. Like Blind Guardian, Yes, Marillion, Steve Vai and Bad Religion all got together with an orchestra and some hand drummers.I cannot recommend this highly enough. ""Progressive, symphonic speed metal"". Fricking amazing."
2,False,"ANGRA is a polemic band in Brazil. Admired in Japan and Europe, most people know hoe their songs are just a rip-off of everything ever made in European power metal. Also, their singer Edu can sing only in studio, and half of the arrangements portrayed in the albums can not be played live."
2,Pedestrian Brazilian band..,"This pedestrian Brazilian band is a hard working outfit, but they simply copy the most recognizable cliches of the European melodic / power metal sytle. It's such a rip-off that will make you nauseous."
3,Addicting...unfortunately,"Normally, I don't really care for music that sounds the least bit like hair band music. I didn't like this very much, but I have to say that the songs are catchy and they do get stuck in your head. And I'll admit they did a decent job. The cover art is cool. Would I buy it? Probably not."
3,A Talented Band...,"This is my 1st venture into the band Angra. Sometimes they sound like the European power-metal, other times a bit like a prog band, with a bit of their Brazilian influences creeping in to a few songs.Where this bogs down is the writing, both the storyline and songs. The storyline, though better written than say, Avantasia, is not very well done. It is incoherant at times and more than a little on the ""cheesy"" side. The songs themselves arent bad, but Angra needs to work on songwriting a bit more to put themselves in the big leauges.Overall, this isnt a bad cd, and Angra are talented musicians, so if you like power-metal-prog (more power metal than prog) then Temple Of Shadows may be a decent buy."
2,Strange gun,"The first one I received worked twice. (I mean 2 staples!) I called the manufacturer and was told that they were sensitive to input voltage. I plugged it into the washer/dryer outlet and it still didn't work. When I called Northern Tool for a refund, they said for an item of that price range they would just send me a new one and I should throw away the first one. The second one came but I'm not impressed, and it also works better plugged directly to a 'strong' outlet. One cannot always provide this kind of accommodation to a stapler, so I am intend to return this one for a refund and get my previously reliable old Arrow repaired."
3,little job done,Surebonder 5900 Electric Staple Gunit ok the best but get the little job done thank k.c.
4,"easy, convenient","Easy, convenient, especially while travelling or while having to juggle more than one kid at the same time. However, this previously widely available product is no longer available anywhere else except here, which is a pain when you run out or are travelling."
4,Hot Harps,"Chicago Blues MastersThis CD is a solid bit of blues history featuring some of Chicago's brightest stars. Right from the get go the legendary Magic Sam tears through `Sweet Home Chicago,' followed by Bell's `I'm Ready.' Crudups take on `Look on Yonder Wall' is one of my favorite versions of this classic. This CD is laden with hot harp work from Carey Bell, Big Walter Horton & Magic Sam. The only draw back to this title is the quality of recording and overall lack of information. I own it and listen to it often!"
3,A good introductory history to mountaineering the Alps.,"This book while not compelling or a must read, is still a well written if standard introduction to the the story of the conquest of the Alps by (mostly) British climbers from the Alpine Club. While it is neither as authoritative nor comprehensive (nor thankfully as long) as Walt Unsworth's ""Everest"" it is nonetheless a fine introduction that engagingly lays out both the plot and characters in the story of man vs the Alps. From his blbliography and introduction, you can pick up the story in more detail where you please. His treatment of Whymper is first-rate; indeed he is more indulgent and less sardonic with these heroes than he was of John Barrow and his ""boys.""Mr. Fleming, in addition to laying out the facts, is always shrewd in his analysis of motive and character. Again, while this is no classic, it is a professional job by an intelligent writer on a fascinating subject intended for the general reader. I was appreciative."
2,Killing Time with Killing Dragons,"The author has admittedly presented a thorough (if not exhausting) history of the earlier attempts and successes in summiting the Alps. And there you have it! Not much excitement, nothing thrilling...sort of like Sgt. Joe Friday on the old ""Dragnet"" series...just the facts, ma'm! This book might be enjoyed by those who find interest in the arcane and the mundane. I say pass it by and find any number of much more interesting books on mountaineering, exploring and stories of summiting. I gave it two stars for the nice picture on the cover jacket!"
4,A Family Tradition,I like the Keeping Quilt because the quilt was made by Patricia Polacco's family. The best part of the book I liked was when they started making the quilt. I like that part because you could see what color it was.
4,And happily my class is obsessed with this!,"This is truly a touching story about family and culture and change in the form of a Russian quilt that is passed down from mother to daughter for several generations, each generation changing slightly with a changing world. The art is lovely, black and white with only the quilt colored."
3,GET THE HARDBACK. THE PAPERBACK IS CONDENSED,"This book is wonderful for the many reasons listed. I first found it at the library in hardback and my daughter and I love it. When I ordered the paperback for her own copy, we realized that the paperback ends 5 or 6 pages short. It fails to discuss Patricia's own family."
3,It was okay.,"Well, it wasn't our favorite book. My kid's were not interested into the story or the pictures very much. I thought the book was beautiful however the message was a lost on my kids."
5,The Keeping Quilt,"Because Rechenkka's Egg was such a lovely book, I bought The Keeping Quilt, as well. My great granddaughter and I enjoyed the exposure to the Jewish customs and symbols. The journey of the quilt from generation to generation and the creative ways it was used gave us ideas about the quilt I have started for her. The illlstrations in the book are just wonderful because the faces seem to be little portraits."
2,"Great Book, but it came with a wrinkled front cover","Great Book, but it came with a wrinkled front cover which makes it impossible for me to use in my presentations.:("
2,Not worth the price,Not up to what I expected the book to be. There are other books by the author that are well worth the price but this one is not.
1,Not interesting...,"I guess I can tell you that all the book says is:""Take care of your anger"".So you have it now and you do not need need to buy this book.It is not really helpfull and has nothing interesting to say."
4,Good,Great things to say in this book... I was a little disappointed to find that it's just a compilation of quotes from his other books (many of which I have already read). It is just one quote per page... felt a little gypped... not a bad book for daily meditation though.
4,"Inspirational ""quick"" read!","This book was inspiring, yet very short. I found that this title isn't one of Nhat Hanh's better books...but if it's your first time with one of his titles than I would recommend it."
5,About time too !,"Thank you Gallagher! As a busy IT consultant and single mother, your insights have helped me to manage my chaotic life! I now look forward to each day and to a new lesson. Incredible!"
5,Inspiring quotes and passages,My friend sent me this book as a gift. I began thumbing through it before I realized three hours had passed - and I was still reading. I like the way it is organized. Lots of cool and inspiring quotes and passages. Suddenly my friends think I'm smart. Recommended for anyone looking for inspiration and guidance.
3,damaged items,"I am very happy with the work of Richard Zimmerman, but the 5 disk set had two disks with damage to them that causes my cd player to skip around a lot and then just freeze. There are dings in the disks and that's what causes the problems."
4,Wilmot,"Well done, with the only drawback that Joshua Rifkind is not at the piano. Sometimes the pace is too frenetic."
1,Not for pleasure,"You may want this just to have any recording at all of some of the otherwise unavailable pieces in this collection. But, this is the worst quality playing I've ever heard on a commercial recording. The marches actually aren't too bad, but anything syncopated is not played right. Zimmerman fat fingers notes in almost every piece (i.e. he hits adjacent notes). The dynamics and tempo are erratic. The attempts at ornamentation are forced. If you enjoy piano playing, you won't enjoy this."
3,"Comprehensive, but sometimes lacks passion","If you enjoy Scott Joplin, there is nothing quite so wonderful as having access to all his published works in one place. Also, the price for the five-CD set is excellent. I certainly got my money's worth. But I found the execution is somewhat mechanical and bland. Admittedly, Joplin was very specific about how he wanted his music played (not too fast, not too loud). Speaking as a keyboard player, Joplin's ragtime is simply my favorite. Somehow the performer took some of the 'oompf' out of the music..."
4,Very good complete set.,"Okay, Zimmerman does tend to play a little faster than he should on many pieces. He also tends to ""jazz up"" certain portions of songs (particularly on the second repetition of the strain). So What! This is the most complete collection of Joplin available and well worth it's price. I don't hear any mistakes in the playing, just ad lib.Ragtime was born to break musical conventions and I believe that many musicians overcompensate when a ragtime composer specifies the tempo as ""Not Fast"". If you listen to live recordings of ragtime or jazz piano recorded during the 20's or 30's, you'll notice that tempo is often somewhat faster than expected. Joplin himself jazzed up certain portions of his songs when he recorded several Conorized piano rolls."
1,doesn't rock very hard,"a lot of self-indulgent syntho blips and squeaks instead of guitars, and the cover version of ""interstellar overdrive"" is just a straight remake of syd barrett pink floyd, only not as dynamic. i've listened to it twice, just to be fair, but i'm irritated at myself that i spent money on this."
3,You get what you pay for,"This necklace was o.k. but as seen in the picture, the clear nylon thread that holds it together never really straightens out. It is very delicate and lightweight."
1,Great Necklace!,"Very nice peridot necklace. I bought the 3-piece set for a birthday gift, and I was proud to give it as a gift."
4,"Overall, nice product",Nothing super special about this fake plant. Looks nice and easy to position around. Our brown anoles lounge in it at night.
5,Nice and full for the price.,I loved how long this item was and the shipped it so fast. Yes I would tell others to buy this.
1,dont waste your time or money on this 1,"dont waste your time or money on this one. THE movie was terrible so bad that the director fails to include his name in the final credits i feel as though the director should somehow attempt to repay me the money i wasted on this film and the time i spent watching it , maybe he can mow my lawn to compensate me. avoid this one at all costs"
1,Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is the Climax,I really hated this movie and it was a waste of 3 bucks to rent. Keeanu is just not a very good actor and he really can't do a serial killer...Nobody can do a role like Bill and Ted and then turn around and be a serial killer...He needs to find his niche and feed off of it...If Keanu keeps this up his career is going to go down the toilet like this movie did
2,Reeves keeps this one alive,Reeves makes this one work with his serial killer mood but Spader lets this one fall as the cop in search for him. and the movie runs out of steam after awhile but seeing Reeves with his piano wire and the finale is worth watching.
1,There's a reason you never heard of this movie....,"I do not like trashing movies because there are a lot of movies that I could see some people enjoying, but just weren't for me. This is not one of those movies. I'm a big fan of everyone involved, except for maybe the director I guess. Tried to be stylish, but failed. Do not pay to watch this movie."
1,THIS IS HD DVD - NOT COMPATIBLE,"This is a review of the product, not the movie (which is terrific!).Silly me, I didn't realize that ""HD DVD"" is the ""Betamax"" of the 21st centuary. (Those of you old enough to appreciate this movie may remember that VHS won the videotape battle.)Anyway, to the point........""HD DVD"" can only be played on an HD DVD player. It will not work on either a regular DVD player (didn't expect it to), nor a Blueray player (DID expect it to).Forewarned is forearmed. Caveat emptor and all that!"
5,excellent video!!!,"I previously owned this movie,and would highly recommend it to anyone that likes a good thriller. It is not gory or full of senseless violence,but instead is a tightly woven story with just enough twists and turns to grab your attention and keep it!!"
2,Good sound track-poor suspense and acting,Someone reccomended this to me cause I like scary suspense movies. A good suspense movie takes an art of proper speeding and slowing down the action in conjunction with the visual effects and things like that. Pretty much not done real well her. Acting not too good either. Does have a pretty good 5.1 track for those with home theatre.
2,Yuck!,"I just finished The Watcher. I found it to be garbage. Keanu played Keanu. Dull, dull, duller. And what a stinker way to end a film. Ever notice how serial killers in these types of movies want to get caught, try to get and at the end of the movie, get caught?? The director of this movie had this meticulous serial killer who planned everything out. Then, the killer becomes sloppy and any old girl would do. Garbage. I guess if you can't find anything you have not seen yet you should watch this. But, don't buy it."
2,Keanu just didn't cut it !,"After viewing this movie in the theater, I walked out not really suprised because I kinda figured the movie wouldn't be that good, but I tried it because I liked Keanu in the Matrix. Well, let me tell you, his ""Whoa"" voice that he speaks in just ruined his serial killer character because he just talked too goofy and wasn't scary at all. The darkness and spookiness of the movie gave it kind of a cool tone, but without a good bad guy, it's not a good movie!"
2,Really Really Bad Movie,All performances uninspired. Action sequences ridiculously unrealistic. In all a real snoozefest.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"This had to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. I love spader, but why!!!???overacting, just plain dumb and unbelievable...in the first few seconds i felt embarrassed to be watching.rent it and you will see what i mean."
1,Overly Formulaic,"This is a film that you could figure out the ending in a matter of moments. You know who the killer is (Reeves), and you know that he will be brought down by the ""intelligent"" officer (Spader), the real question is only that of how long is it going to take to catch him. This film is done in a way that makes it painfully dull to watch. We have seen all of these scenes of violence in other movies, but in the other movies they were done more tastefully. The real truth is that Reeves does not make a great villian. He may be torturing these women, but all you can help to think is that you saw him in Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. You do not want to see Bill, or was he Ted, strangling a woman. You do not want to see anyone doing that. We, the movie going public, have seen these formulaic acts of violence committed numerous times, by now they just lose any merit and originality. This film should have tried to be original. Instead it is just a retread of many films we have seen before."
3,An Interesting Piece of Film,"The main thing that made me want to see this movie was to see if Keanu Reeves could pull off the whole serial killer thing. I was impressed with his performance. Actually I was impressed with the whole thing. It was done tastefully and well. It was really nice to see James Spader finally in another movie. In my opinion, he's a very under-rated actor. The main plot line follows Spader's character. He's an ex FBI agent that before leaving was heading a major investigation looking for a serial killer named David Allen Griffin. Griffin (Reeves) is fixated on Spader and wants him back in the game. There's a lot of action, and some cool cinematic shots done that made the movie have a really interesting feel. I recommend this one to the people looking for some good entertainment."
2,mediocra action movie,"I thought that the names Keanu Reeves and James Spader sounded quite promising for this movie, but in fact it is just an average action movie with a storyline you saw many times before. Many effects, but it's not really catching."
4,A 4 star nail biter!!!!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this suspenseful movie! Had read and heard so many negative reviews from critics. I really didn't understand their point. The brightest light in this flick was Reeves.He played the best criminal/bad guy i've seen in a long time. And I felt that he really enjoyed himself!!!!If he should read this: *Please play more bad guys in the future!* He really gave James Spader a fit playing cat and mouse. A better script, someone other than Spader (who was very weak in his role)would have tightened this good crime drama into a 5 star. But don't let these ""minor"" issues stop you from buying and enjoying this one! *Also, loved the spooky music played on the DVD menu!*"
1,RENT IT!!!,"You will only be able to stomach watching it once,this movie was TERRIBLE!!K.Reeves most have squueezed this in during his tight schedule,acting was bad on all the actors parts.The storyline would have been more believable with a different actors playing the Watcher and the FBI agent."
2,NOT THE BEST,"Parts of the movie were okay, but there were parts that were so mind-numbingly dumb I couldn't believe it. Take for instance all of the dumb cops standing in front of an all glass elevator, holding pictures of the intended victim and they are looking every which way but their gaze seems to bypass the glass elevator that the victim is standing in looking right at them....duh. Also, hi could they make Marisa Tomei look worse??? She is a pretty woman and they have her looking terrible. James Spader was very good. I'd never watch it again."
3,Very Watchable,"Decent movie, but it is saved by Spader's great performance as burned-out FBI agent Joel Cambell, Reeves, does a horrible roll as Spader's rival David Allen Griffith.Spader is in one of his most amazing performances, I personally think he is very underrated, his role in this probably only rivaled by that in StarGate.Worth Watching on HBO, or renting, certainly not buying."
1,garbage,"this could possibly be one of the worst movies ever made. the trailer made this movie seem like a movie to see, but then when you watch it you just want to walk out..if you ever wanted to be a psychic for a day though, i highly reccomend that you buy or rent this movie,..it's that predictable. 1 star."
3,Interesting to say the least.,"im not a kid im 19 but it wont let me write reviews with my account cause i havent bought anything. Anyway i watched this movie around the time it was first released on vidoeo and i thought it was the creepiest movie. I am watching this movie right now and its been 5 years at least since i have seen it. It seems not creepy now. Keanu is known for his overacting and mostly crappy movies. i hate the slow mo shots because u get beyond dizzy. ironically i still find keanu hot in this movie. must be the hair. lol. the acting is atrocious except on the part of james spader, who i have always liked since stargate. well n e way looks like m stuck making kids reviews so im leaving a name so u can maybe look up my other kid reviews.**DarkAlleyCat**"
4,An original thriller!,Unusual story about a serial killer who constructs methodically with explicit detail every one of his murderers: He chooses lonely woman and sends photographs hours before to commit the crime.James Spader looks very convincing but Keanu Reeves was not at his best level.The final sequence presents a visible fault in what special effects concern.Nevertheless the film gets its aim.
