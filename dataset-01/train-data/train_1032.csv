4,Great book!,"This was one of those books that I truly enjoyed. I love reading a book from someone who's been there and puts the detail in there. I want the specifics of what each officer is doing, what call-outs are going on in the CIC and this was all there. This wasn't written by an amateur that had never set foot on a guided missile destroyer, this was written by a retired CPO. I hope Mr. Edwards continues to write these sea stories for those of us that enjoy reading them."
4,"Well done, Mr Edwards..","Two of my favorite authors are Vince Flynn and Brad Thor, even though I'm not strictly a political thriller kind of guy. However, I decided to try a change of pace with Sea of Shadows and break some routine. What I found was a highly entertaining read that had good, continuous suspense - which is surprising, because a lot of these military thrillers do get bogged down in the technical set ups (especially for us amateurs).The positives: Very few wasted words and thought processes. Good high-seas action with the requisite level of ass-kicking. Plot took unexpected turns, which is often what happens when there's a respectable adversary.Negatives: The dialogue is a little stiff, but perhaps authentic Navy-speak. Even though the book obviously emphasizes the spirit of teamwork, I prefer a little more character development in the hero - who I would presume to be the USS Towers captain.Definitely worth the time and money."
5,incredible,this book was absolutly amazing. i love the suspence and the action is phenominal. if you like great books look no further
5,sea of shadows,very exciting. makes you not to want to put the book down. his understanding of how maritime shipping tied into intrigue compels you to keep on reading.I would definately pick up a copy of Jeff Edwards next book.
5,Edwards is a techno-thriller master,"Sea of Shadows and Jeff Edwards companion work are among the best tecno-thrillers since Tom Clancy was in his prime. The continuous action and technical details combined to keep the pages turning in a quest to see what complexities Captain Bowie and crew would have to overcome next. I can't wait for the next book!Gary Ryman, Author of ""Fire Men: Stories From Three Generations of a Firefighting Family""www.fire-men-book.com"
4,Enjoyable if far fetched,I enjoyed this book and raced through it. If one suspends belief about the basic political premise the rest of the story is well told and gripping at times. The characters are sufficiently deeply drawn to be credible but without an agonisingly detailed back-story. I enjoyed early Tom Clancy and the military techo-thriller genre and I would recommend this book if you have similar tastes.
5,Great Naval Fiction,"Not fiction for the ages, but a great page turner.As long as we're on the USS Towers it's all good. The Washington scenes are pretty terrible. The U-boat scenes are pedestrian. When we are on the ship, though, things get really, really good, Authentic detail, excellent pacing, characters I cared about, and a steady buildup of tension. Once things got rolling I couldn't put it down. It's not the best book I've ever read, but I think it has the best naval battle scenes I have read."
4,A great read,"For one not very knowledgeable in underwater military technology, Jeff gives a great account of the tech and tactics in this kind of warfare!"
4,Good military thriller at bargain price,"This book is well written and better documented about the intricacies of under sea warfare. The initial plot, well developed nevertheless, is not very convincing, but if you forget this point, it makes for a very interesting and pleasant reading."
4,Fast & entertaining read,"Part of a series, that made me get all of them. Edwards is a very good writer, fast paced entertaining stories that could become headlines."
3,Sea of Shodows,Fast . A lot of basic weapons history who made History interesting. Very current events story a fun and fast read.
4,A little too real and a quick read!,This was a great fiction navy story. Basis here is that Germany is failing and on the brink of collapse so they offer to sell 3 brand new high tech subs to a enemy county in exchange for their oil to help them with their energy crisis. The US tries to intervene and stop delivery of these subs and has an adventure doing so. This was a great quick read and hard to put down. It is also a pretty good idea and pretty realistic in my mind about what could happen if someone decided to go against the UN and do something like this. Pretty interesting story and I would recommend this book to anyone who like sea books.
1,Why can't we get the Original recordings.,Why can't we get the Original recordings. I only ordered this for Two songs and they were both crappy rerecordings.
1,Terrible,All remakes. I couldn't return it so I threw it in the garbage. Had to give it at least 1 star so my review would go through.
3,Pet Stages Multi Texture Chew Ring - NOT FOR STRONG CHEWERS!,My cocker has very strong teeth. We only adopted him in January. So we are trying to find toys to keep him interested and toys that are strong. We have learned the toys that he destroys in minutes - anything with stuffing. But I thought this toy would be a good chew toy for him. The balls are made of plastic not rubber - rubber would be better. He ate through the blue ball wihin an hour of giving it to him.This balls and such are not good for hard chewers. He likes the rope part and has not eaten through that.I am on the search for strong hard to eat though dog toys.Allison
2,Not strong enough for an 11 lb. dog,"My ll lb. Shih-Poo loved this toy because he loves to chew. However, he destroyed a lot of it in less than 24 hours."
4,Chew Ring,Puppy likes this toy and each ball that is attached is a different texture which is great for teething. You can also play tug of war and throw it for a game of fetch.
3,Replacement toy not as durable as original,"A couple of years ago I bought my dog this same chew toy... the rope was blue, but otherwise it's the same. She loved it to the point that the rope was finally starting to shred (the plastic pieces are still completely intact, but it just seemed like a good time to get a new one). The problem was I couldn't find another one in the stores. I was thrilled to find it online and bought her a replacement for Christmas. She 'opened' her toy (yesterday) and it's obviously still her favorite toy in the world; the problem is that the plastic pieces don't seem to be as durable. As I mentioned, the original chew toy has them intact, but in less than 24 hours she has managed to chew off the yellow/green plastic ball and shred it into small pieces. As much as she loves this toy, this will be the last one... can't risk her choking on the small pieces."
1,Better material needed for the balls,"I had high hopes for this toy for my 6 month old min pin mix. He really loved playing with it! But not only were the spikes on the blue ball chewed off in a day, he'd also chewed off a chunk of the ball!It's a mistake to advertise this as a chew toy - it's not going to withstand any level of chewing unless they replace the plastic material used for the balls with something much tougher.I can see that it might work as a tug toy used for well supervised play."
1,Seafood Cooking For Dummies,"I found this book lacked so much on seafood, shellfish type. It seems it was only written about the type of fish they liked. I believe it only has one or two recipes for scallops. When I got the book, I regreted buying it."
5,The greatest creation,This was the nostrum of physicas that leaves one in tears for relapsing into psuedo-filial post-reason. How many albums have you bought recently? Buy a 4 track with what you have saved from not buying albums any more and make senseless beauty on your own.
3,Good But Not High Quality,"This original series is excellent for the production and acting. Because most of the earlier versions are black and white, the quality does not show up very well on my HD TV. Of course, additionally, the audio is lacking and that with the British accent lends to not understanding all of the dialogue. I will continue to watch additonal episodes only because the story and characters are quite interesting."
1,"Upstairs, Downstairs",Disappointed. Dull. Total lack of humor. Did not see much from this series in the way of entertainment. There was no way for these characters to hold the attention of an audience for very long.
3,A Real Downer,"Very well done, but just too depressing. Every episode I've watched so far has been a real downer. Memo to John Hawkesworth: Good things do happen to people sometimes."
3,Subtitles anyone?,Can anyone tell me if this collection has closed-caption specifically English subtitles? It's for someone in my family who is hard of hearing but the format description here doesn't specify so i am not sure..need to know before I purchase. Hope someone can answer soon..much appreciated!
3,Damaged goods!,"This item was damaged on 2 of the dvds (they tiled throughout) of the series. I sent an email to the company and they never responded. I would not buy from them again.Upstairs, Downstairs: Series One"
2,Downstairs,I will not watch anymore of this series.... I am probably spoiled by Downton Abby as it is soooo great!
5,Unpublicised Pulp Fiction,"I read the reviews on [this site] and was surprised they were mixed. ""American Strays"" is only for offbeat viewers who have experienced the wierd side of life along with David Lynch and Robert Rodriguez. Don't take it serious but as an everyday dry humor flick. The bungling frustration of Eric Roberts and pseudo naievity of Jennifer Tilly make this a GREAT film for those who take life very lightly. I liked it enough to make the purchase."
1,Stupid,"This movie was so stupid and boring!I wanted to see it because Eric Roberts was on the cover but he was hardly even it.You would think him being on the cover he would be one of the main characters,not so.They just had him on there to lure people with a big name to watch this trash.I don't if I just don't get this movie but all I know I barely sat through it.I recommend this movie only to your enemies as a torture device.Don't waste your time on it!"
3,eehhh,item was very grainy looking - like its been chewed on - kind of felt bad giving it to my niece.
1,MUFFLED MASTERPIECE,"""Mefistofele"" is a truly neglected masterpiece by Arrigo Boito. The problem here is that the recording is so very, very old and that the sound quality is abyssmal. What a ""rip-off."" I couldn't bear to listen to more than fifteen minutes before I gave up."
5,A QFT book for engineers!,This book takes any engineer with a feel for Maxwell's equations and a little common sense about Schroedinger's equation into the promissed land of quantum field theory.Veltman spends a lot of time helping the reader get his or her head wrapped around the idea of Hilbert space. This cleared my head for what was to follow.It is one of the few books that does not assume you already know the subject. I recommend it for electrical engineers like myself. No idea is hard to understand when the author values communicating notions over notation!Five stars for Martinus Veltman!
1,Absolutely avoid this DVD version of an important early film,"The Alpha Home Entertainment version of this Wiene film is utterly unwatchable. There is nothing redeeming about it. The musical sound track is atrocious, the image quality is worse than fifth or sixth generation VHS transfered to DVD. I've rarely come across a decent Alpha DVD but this is as bad as I've ever had the misfortune to purchase. Never again. How do they keep getting away with it?"
2,Outdated,It's amazing how quickly a book written in 2004 can be outdated (bought this in 2007). It's really just scratching the surface of what you can learn from reading a blog on web analytics. Not worth the money.
1,"Shallow content, Overpriced book","This book has a very shallow content, and is only a glorified feature listing of web analytics product features with no in-depth details at all. What makes it worse is it is highly overpriced for what shallow content it offers. This information can be obtained from the vendors website datasheets also. Avoid this book."
1,don't waste your time or money,This was outdated and simple before it was pubslished. You can read better info just glancing at some white papers for web analytic firms. Even the person the author got to write a preface only suggested reading a few chapters - which you could read in no-time-at all.
3,Excellent Photos!,"Although this book discusses some of the building techniques of northwest coastal Indian canoes, it is not a ""how-to"" manual. Instead, it is more of a ""coffee table"" book dealing with the history, construction, and modern uses of the large dug-out canoes used by the Indians of Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. As such, I found the book to be interesting and informative. There are many excellent color photographs of traditional northwest coast canoes, native people, and native clothing. I recommend it to anyone interested in traditional wooden boats or the native cultures of the northwest coast and southeast Alaska."
2,just alittle too big for my needs,Bought this for all the recipes my husband cuts out of our local newspaper. It is too big and clumsy to fit in my cabinet.
2,Not the whole package,I ordered this book rather than other because I wanted the CD-rom study guide as well. It did not come with the book. And the book is not in good condition either. It is real tattered. The description was very misleading!
3,Not a book for beginners,"I had to purchase this book for my guide to AP European History.I had never before had a course in European History and this gave me a disadvantage in using this book.Because the text assumes you know who everyone is, the immeadiately tell you every single way history views important people, classes, wars, monarchs, etc.Also, the reading can get very tedious.However, I gave this book 3 stars because it does offer more than just what happened. It also tries to show the student, ""why did it happen.""TO teachers/professors: Only give this book to your class if they have some experience of European History"
5,Fast delivery in the condition expected!,Lost this textbook and needed a replacement fast. This book was delivered within a week after placing the order. I would order from this seller again!
3,What I wanted except.....,"It was a fair price for the book, but the book looked like it had been dropped in a bucket of water. The pages were wrinkled and it wasn't it the best of the condition. Just hope I can resell it when I finish with it."
5,The Blood Speaks (CD),"No matter your struggle, no matter your strength, if you need aid, there is a weapon you can use! When Jesus came from heaven to our truf, the demons celebrated because they thought they could finally destroy Jesus on the cross. But if the demons had read the fourth chapter of Genesis, they would have see that when Cain slew Abel, even though the body died, the blood kept talking!The same knife that Cain used to kill Abel foreshadows the knife of judgment that was raised against the innocent Jesus, who died and shed His blood for our sins.To Cain, God said, ""I have heard the voice of thy brother's blood."" And it's all the more true of the perfect, powerful blood of Jesus! Experience the powerful teaching of T.D. Jakes and learn that the blood of Jesus still speaks!"
4,Great Read!!!!,I was pretty amazed at how good this book was.I give it up to the author for sucking you in and keeping you interested. Great Read.. I will be checking out more of this author's book...Thank you Maggie Casper!
1,Read and write errors!!! Avoid!,I own it for 1 week and already I need to replace it. I get read and write errors causing device to fail. Get anything but PNY.
2,Little use for this usb,"This product is advertised as compatible for palm products and when I plugged it into the device, it wasn't even recognized. So don't buy a 2gb memory card for a Palm Tungsten, it won't work."
5,SD Flash card,"Outstanding product at an outstanding price. I've searched the internet for the best prices on memory cards for my digital camera and have not found a site less expensive than Amazon. I got a 2GB card for $19! You can't beat that! Trust me, this is a good deal."
3,"Not made anymore, they sell a standard one","Very hard to get a real optima class 4 anymore, no longer made and i was sent one that might be class 4 but didn't say, and wasn't an optima label. It works maybe as well, don't know. The factory said the last year any 2gb sd cards were made, internal parts were all class 4, so if it is new it is probably from those last ones made, but the labels don't say what class it is. A real optima label class 4 on an old chip was excellent. The seller refunded me immediately and said keep the chip when i said it is not certain it is optima. A good seller."
2,Two out of three were defective,"I bought the three-pack of the PNY Optima SD 60x 2GB cards. One card loaded up with pictures just fine and used the whole 2GB. I tried to load pictures on the other two cards and got about 70-100MB loaded on each of them and then they wouldn't take any more, giving this error: ""Cannot copy [filename]: The directory or file cannot be created."" I talked to a technician at the Geek Squad and she said a number of these have been returned with the same problem. I will be returning these and exchanging them for another brand."
4,Trusty,"I bought this and it really works!! The lock switch went on a few too many times, then I tore that off!!! :((( Now my computer cannot move/ write files on the card!! **** Be watchfull!! My camera (Cannon Powershot A-520) never told me that the card was locked, and when I went to download the pictures to my laptop the pictures DIDN'T appear!!- Dany questions direct to me!!"
5,GREAT DVD!,Want to know what it's like behind the scenes of a major country stars tour? This is the DVD to see!!!! Kenny is such a great person...I am sure jealous of all the road crew that works for him!Hey Kenny! Have any job openings??? :)
5,On The Road With Kenny,"This DVD gives insight into not only Kenny Chesney the performer, but also the behind-the-scenes of his concerts. He has surrounded himself with friends from his childhood, whom he trusts and has a good rapport with. Chesney's road crew is interviewed and you can tell they all love their jobs, which is a reflection on what a nice man Kenny must be. Kenny had to work for a long time to get where he is today, and he is humble and appreciative of his fans. You will love Kenny after viewing this film and will want to attend one of his concerts. The man from East Tennessee puts on a great show and this DVD makes a great addition to any collection."
1,not arrived after almost five weeks,almost five weeafter ks waitng I did nor receive this dvd yet.According to the tracking information it is still in transit...still waiting
5,Marshall Mansion Cage Cover,"The description was a little confusing because it gave the dimensions of the MINI Mansion. I was able to call another seller and figure out that the size was for the larger version, which I needed. I don't have a Marshall cage, but the dimensions are all that matters. This is an excellent, quality cage cover. It has perfectly placed windows made of netting. There are 2 zippers on the front that allow the fron of the cage to be exposed. it rolls up and secures with velcro.I bought it to keep my critters warm because my cage is outside. On cold nights I add a sheet just to be sure they're toasty.I'd also like to add, Amazon rocked when shipping this item. I can't believe i got it in 2 days and before Christmas!"
2,Not much as far as horror,"Of course ""the Surgeon"" is a low budget film but what is a horror movie without suspense? This film had it's share of gore and murder but it all came with a yawn. The main characters were underdeveloped so when they meet their end the veiwer could hardly care less. The story had possibilities but just didn't follow through. Some low budget films turn out to be some of the best in the horror genre but this is not one of them. The DVD has scene selection and that is all. That could be a blessing. I dont think anyone would care to hear a commentary track on how this 'gem' got made."
3,A Nice Weird Science Thriller But Not A Horror Movie,"First of all this movie is a thriller it is not a horror movie. It is basically a hospital based who done it with some weak science fiction elements thrown in. All in all I think the movie is rather good. There are some cheesy parts and if you are looking for a typical horror flick then this is not it. But the story is decent, it is a weird science story about a mad doctor that have found a way to regenerate damage to his body that now run around an kill pepole to get the body fluids he need for his regeneration as well as for revenge on the pepole that fired him, but the story is not a big masterpiece, see the film for what it is, a cheap thrill and a bit of fun entertainment without much dept and you will not be disappointed."
2,A Grand Tradition Not Well Served,"What, are the French murdering Protestants again? Claude Goudimel, who died during the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, left a legacy of psalm settings that has echoed through music history. But hearing them presented as they are here, one would wonder why. The psalms are sung with one voice to a part, but the voices are unattractive, even repellant. I bought the disc trusting the three reviewers before me. Don't do it. Thank heaven the French have found interpreters of music from this period like Niquet and Visse, whose recordings can be heard with unalloyed pleasure."
1,An ending as deflating as an exploding balloon,"What's wrong with this writer that he can't write a good ending? Why is it that so many mystery writers flunk the ending part of their final exams? Granted there is a certain sustained interest in the transnational mechanics and flow of terrorist money which sustains the plot.The hero's relationship with his English spy girl friend is so sappy and unfulfilling that watching soap operas is more enjoyable. Reich must have felt that if he set the plot in Paris, he'd capture the tourist reader. Reich's ending is so flat and unpolished that one can imagine he was under time constraints to finish. Remember those college exam time blue books, where the clock is ticking away and you are scribbling away to fill all 12 pages. Well, that is Reich pounding away with the clock ticking and not sure what he is writing. Nonsense, utter implausible nonsense."
3,Illegal Money Transfers,It shows how the use of money in the wrong hands causes many of the ills of today. It involves trying to stop the flow of funds to terrorist.
2,Disappointed,"Having a financial background adds much to my enjoyment of Christopher Reich novels.And I really enjoyed his first three books especially Numbered Account.But I just could not get into his latest endeavor The Devils Banker. For me it was disjointed,overly complex which some people describe as ""intelligent"" but which I describe as obtuse. Most importantly it was mainly conversations among the characters rather than exciting action.One might think he was attempting to write a LeCarre like novel. I'd rather re-read Numbered Account."
4,Fun read - terrorist hunting from the numbers side,"This was an enjoyable read overall. Being in the banking industry, I viewed this as ""professional development"" but fortunately for you, it didn't delve into banking in great detail. The story deals with an emerging threat and how the lead character, a PW accountant by training, hunts down the terrorist by tracking the finances. This activity complements the more familiar methods of combatting terror.I thought the book was a great read overall, and the ending was climatic to be sure. Lots of twists and turns, and points of excitement throughout.My only beef with the book is that my TV brain likes a neat ending that wraps up all the loose ends. These book writers like to stop short and end the book abruptly, and Reich's book is no exception."
4,Well Worth Reading!,"Suspenseful, well-written and interesting. The plot of The Devil's Banker is very timely in view of what is now going on in the world and provides a well-balanced perspective. Highly recommended."
3,Good way to kill time,"This book is engaging and entertaining.SPOILER ALERT!Is is, however pretty typical - Guy with riches from a previous job meets mysterious woman, travels around Europe chasing criminals without sleeping or eating, manages to do the job of entire police forces, finds himself awry of those forces and eventually saves the day."
3,Not good,"I became aware of Christopher Reich and a fan of his when I read Rules of Deception and Rules of Vengeance, two of his newer books, so I decided to go back and read his earlier books. But I felt that this book was almost like it was written by a different person. There was a distinct lack of character development and the storyline was too busy with too many things going on at the same time without developing each line. The good thing I can say is that his writing has much improved and his two latest books are much better than his earlier ones."
1,nonsense,"I had looked forward to reading this one, but was terribly disappointed. The story has no sense of reality not does it approach fact. A real loser!!"
3,Unknown Voices,"These duets are great, but does anyone know who these voices are? They sing well, but not great. The diction is awful and some notes are even sung wrong."
1,Not remotely like the picture.,"This ring is GIANT, i mean ""block incoming laser beams from space"" giant. I mean ""Wonder-twins-activate"" giant. too big to be attractive, and if you copy and paste this ring into the search bar in amazon, you will find the same ring from other vendors, that IS correct. What a WIDE ring."
5,"Powerful, Light and Precise","I bought this instead of the bosch/skil worm-drive and have not regretted it one bit. I have used the Hypoid for everything froming framing work to cutting window sills. Great control, power and precision. Highly recommended."
1,Mechanically a huge disappointment,"My In-Laws gave us this swing (Calvin purchased from Wal-mart) for our little girl. We assembled it and the motor did not work. We returned it and got a new one. It worked for 2 months. The first time we changed the batteries the motor quit working reliably. Graco promised a new motor the first week of June, then let us know they would replace the swing if we shipped it back (they would pay shipping). We didn't have the original box or one big enough. We took it back to Wal-mart. While the Graco was very comfy and nice to look at, there is obviously a problem with the design of the motors. We then went to B-R-U and purchased the Smart Stages Bunny Swing/Rocker by Fisher-Price. Our little one loves it! The FP is quieter and much easier to get our daughter in and out of.The review is one star because we had 2 defective swings, but also because customer service didn't really do a terrific job. Nice, polite, but no help in getting the bad swing shipped back to them."
2,Not what I was looking for,"The book was written like a diary with most of the interesting parts removed. Priscilla does a nice job of sharing some of the people and personal observations of her experience, but does not cover what I was interested in. Where was she at in her riding when she arrived, what did she accomplish while she was in training, and how did that opportunity help her when she returned? She did share what she saw in stable management and horse care, but mostly at an observer's level. I was interested in finding out what she learned and how working with a dressage master changed her own riding."
3,satisfied curiosity,I find the book to be well written and well organized. A facinating revelation for many serious riders who have always wanted to know what it would be like to take this adventure. A void has been filled at longlast. Golden Hills Press
4,Great Read,"This is an insider's book, meaning if you don't ride seriously you probably wouldn't get it. Priscilla writes beautifully and I enjoyed it very much - easy read but very good."
4,"Light, enjoyable and thought provoking.","This is the sort of book that flows along and before you know it you are done, or you can set it down and pick it back up a week later and still feel like you never stopped. Her descriptions of the differences in dressage between the two worlds is informative and oft times entertaining. I found myself asking, ""what would I do in her shoes"" more than once."
3,"yes, i love coffee","Lots of odds and ends on here, mostly early recordings which are kind of hit and miss...mainly because they sound a bit scattershot and unfocused. some great ideas are represented that show early on that Braid were all about non traditional song structures. just check out ""elephant""...very weird song...but good...lots of surprises. but some songs are just too clever for their own good, still...you can't deny the talent involved. this cd ends with 6 cover songs which are all pretty bad and will make you reach for the fast forward button many times. but for the sake of completeness, they are included. ""Movie Music Vol 2"" is not as strong as Vol 1, but pretty good stuff all around...probably only recommended for fans of the band...not a good starting point for those curious about Braid."
4,Another great anthology,"This disc is an anthology of all the songs that braid did for comps during their illustrious time together. The only reason why I can't give this one five stars is because I think that volume one is a bit better. There are a few songs that are on their studio releases to but the recordings on these seem more raw to me, therfore I like these better. The last group of tracks are all covers each with their own charm. Braids take on ""Baby Now That I've Found You"" and The Pixies ""Trompe Le Monde"" have to be some of the best covers ever.A truly rockin' Braid album."
3,Entertaining!,"Not in any way a major blockbuster, but defitnitely worth checking out all the same. The chandelier scene is so funny, as is the confrontation that is interrupted to tidy the furniture. More of a tv movie feel, but compulsory viewing for any X-Files fan due to the presence of the undeniably sexy Nic Lea."
3,"Entertaining, but not great","This had potential to be a great DVD. Anything with the name John Woo associated is already in line to be a great action film but I couldn't help feeling somewhat let down by this one. The acting was somewhat wooden and although the often great stunts and FX went someway to offset this I felt that the package was lacking. The plot is a somewhat familiar one, two guys, one girl, a Hong Kong based crime syndicate and the action arising from competition for the girl whilst running from a powerful crime gang. Added to this the absence of Dolby Surround or Digital and it is one you can save for a boring afternoon rental from the local video store. It was entertaining but in no way would I say good or great..."
2,Is this really a John Woo film?,"Although John Woo is listed as the director for this film, one wonders how much involvement he really had. With the exception of a few action sequences, this has ""made for TV"" written all over it and, in fact, in the US that's where it debuted. It's a loose remake of his 1991 Hong Kong film and was produced, on the cheap, in Vancouver. Nicholas Lea, best known for his character Krycek on the X-Files, must have done this between his appearances on that show which, at the time, was also filming in Vancouver. The DVD case says it's rated ""R"" but it's more along the lines of a ""PG"" film . . . lots of shooting but no blood. It's not a bad time waster, but it's just not very memorable. The ending sets it up for a TV series. This was originally a budget release from Simitar and now A-Pix. Besides some chapter breaks, the only extra that you get is a single frame of production credits. I paid just ... for this so I'm not complaining . . . too much."
3,"Ugh, Michael Wong!","Re-made for Canadian television, this movie did have potential. It's got a lot of creativity, and some action-flick humor...but the chemistry between actors felt unnatural--too forced. And worst of all, Michael Wong was cast into a leading role. This dude CANNOT act. He should change his name to Monotone Wong (or Wong Daan-Diu in Cantonese)."
1,Don't Buy - Lousy Audio,"I like the movie and the video portion of the DVD is great. However, the audio is horrible. Constant crackling like an old, scratched record (for those who remember what they are). I have three (yes 3) original copies of this DVD and all 3 are defective. Don't waste your money."
3,3 stars movie,Not bad film. Quite stylish action. Me recommend to buy it only if u saw a same TV series! Problem with the soundtrack: crackling noise during many scenes. Sound in Dolby Prologic only. :(
2,Rip-Off!,"I thought I was purchasing the original movie when I bought this. Wow, was I disappointed! I haven't felt this ripped-off since I was a kid and bought the Ronco amazing cocktail glass chiller. There are some funny lines, but not a drop of blood and it really irks me when people are constantly beating each other up and don't have a single mark on their face after getting smacked. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this piece of junk thinking it was the real thing. I don't know how Woo sleeps at night knowing that he lent his name to this. It even has his name as director right on the back cover, but obviously it is not. I lost a lot of respect for Woo after this one. Anyway, don't waste your time."
2,Forgettable.,"What do you get when you have John Woo direct a movie in which bloodshed is not allowed, the actors are all terrible Canadian nobodies, and the general feel is that of a TV-show pilot?That's right, you get Blackjack.Well, you also get this weak little remake of his 1989 Hong Kong film, but without Chow Yun-Fat and Jacky Cheung."
4,Actor/Story review,"John Woo's Once A Thief was made as a Television movie but succedes as a feature film. With BRILLIANT performances from the main cast, Once A Thief is a treat for action fans and for John Woo fans alike. It has all you would expect from a Woo film and more. I would like to Mention the outstanding performance of Nicholas Lea as Victor Mansfield(He should win an emmy)and Micheal Wong as one of the Tang Family. Thier Performances as well as the action make John Woo's Once A Thief a must see for all the family."
5,Once A Thief,Still waiting for the tv series to come out on DVD. The pilot just wets the appetite for the rest.
1,Good Ornament,"Excellent ornament for the affluent office. Certainly cheaper than a ""blot person"".Hope this helps.-Richie Etwaru"
1,TV died and out of warentee before final payment.,"42"" Dell TV died few weeks ago. Dell will assess problem for ~$250 (not including shipping costs) at which point, if it can be fixed, they will charge more to repair. We literally are making our last payment on the 0% plan this month. We were watching TV, heard a fizzling and lost picture. We watch rarely, mostly football, so last year was quite an expensive season of football."
1,Do not buy this TV!,"I bought this TV new and direct from DELL. After just 2 days it would not power on consistently, and when it did it had a very loud buzzing noise. After researching more I found that this is not an uncommon problem. I returned to DELL for a full refund. Avoid TV's made in China!!"
1,DO NOT BUY DELL TV.,"Exactly 2 month after the warranty was expired, my 42"" Plasma TV died. After talking to someone in India I was asked to call the 3rd party support company in the US!! They asked for almost $1000 shipping fee and $260 diagnostic fee plus labor and parts!! The technician told me if it was his TV, he would ask someone local to look at it... if the problem is the Plasma panel (which most likely is) then it would cost me more than $1000 to replace it... if the tuner is the problem, then it would cost $200-300 to fix it...So the bottom line is that seems like this model has the life time of about 26 months! (and like Dell's printer cartrige it counts the number of months since you opened the package and not how much you used it!!!)!!!"
3,I enjoy this album but....,"This album would be easier to enjoy if I could listen to it with my son in the room. Overall, I enjoyed the music on this album, unlike many people I knew that bought it solely for 'through glass' and hated the rest of the CD.The only major flaw of this album that stopped me from rating more highly was the explicit lyrics. After 6 years in the Navy it takes mroe than bad language to offend me, but this album over used it. Probably someone in the band felt that it made them 'hard' or 'edgy' but overall it just felt like they dumped in profanity when they couldn't come up with a creative lyric. By the time it got to the end the profanity was tedious. I really enjoy listening to this, but it frustrates me that I can only listen to it when I am alone in the house or car. Hopefully their next effort will be a little more generally playable."
3,"A Decent Follow Up, However!!","Well after many listens, this Stone Sour release just doesn't seem to have the umph the last one had? It's a decent listen and it has it's moments, but overall it's not as good as the last release. They seem to have tamed it down somewhat and that has taken away from the spirit of the last effort. The last one roared from start to finish and this one kind of just rolls along and never really says much. It just doesn't have any grab you by the throat tunes on it.So in conclusion and don't get me wrong here, it's a good cd, better the average in fact, just not as good as the last one. I believe that they are perhaps trying a little to hard to get some radio time/air play this time out and that says something in itself.So in my way of rating cd's (One being gawd awful, 3 being decent and 5 being outstanding!!)I'd give it a 3.5 stars kinda deal."
2,Too much middle-of-the-road numetal sound for me,"I'm familiar with the singer and guitarist's work in Slipknot, and thought I would check this out based on all its hype and the great single ""Through Glass"".My whole impression of this is ""Slipknot-lite"". Although the singer does more clean singing than screaming in Stone Sour, it doesn't sound all that different than Slipknot, and contains vulgarities and other immature lyrics.The single ""Through Glass"" doesn't sound like any of the other songs on here (except for maybe the last track ""Zzyzx Road"" which will probably be another single) that are very forgettable mid-based numetal type songs. It's sad because when they go out of their way to make AOR friendly songs, they sound amazing, just like the more accessible tunes on the Slipknot albums.Overall I was very disappointed, and although I think he's a great singer, its tough hearing his voice get wasted through a bunch of very generic and boring songs."
4,hard rock metal!,Yeah i agree 5 stars is a must own cd but this one is 3.8 stars in my mind it's pretty kicks a** tough.Their first album sucked but this one is heavier and much better the slow songs are kind of okay but the fast ones are awesome they are hard rock and metal and i agree.The fast songs are more metal and the slow ones are hard rock but probably you would called the screaming metal.Anyway this is a good album to check out it's not a must own but it's pretty good to check out i recommend it.
5,Great Album,"This is a great album brought to us by Stone Sour! It took me a little while to really like it, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it. All in all I would reccomend this album. A little different then the first album, but still the great music from Stone Sour!!!"
4,A little bit different from STONESOUR,Sounds not like thier debut album.... but still good for your ears.
4,stone sour,"I like this cd, but I can't really review it because I haven't listened to it enough. I like their 1st one better."
1,I payed for it but never got it. Im pissed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Teach me to order from a place without a phone number! I never got the item, even though it shows on the credit card that I PAYED FOR IT!!!"
5,great album,i never knew to much about this band but when i started listening ot their albums especially this one i was very impressed and this album is worth buying
5,I love Julia's way of helping!,"I read Julia's book and did her 3 month plan to help me get going and it has helped more than anything I've tried! It's so easy and has helped me change my life by looking at all the great things I can do to improve my life, which has helped me lose weight! I've lost 29 pounds in the last 4 months, and have 26 pounds to go, even though I'm looking at this as adapting to a healthy lifestyle. Julia's way of helping has helped put me in control and giving me strength to make the simple changes to lose weight and be happy! I would recommend her book if your looking for the motivation, and her Lifechanger for giving you the step-by-step plan! Check it out on her website!"
4,Some thoughts on a good book,"I read the various reviews as well as the book. Julia may not have the perfect book, but she provides people with a simple, effective way to lose weight plus herself as an example. I loved the book. She is not a nutritionist, but do you really think that most dieters don't know all that information already? We know what we are supposed to do, the question is how to do it and that is what Julia provides."
4,A Great Start,"This book was wonderful in turning my thinking around. It gave me the tools needed to stop obsessing about food and start treating my body the way it deserves. It was great to have a perspective from someone whose been there and conquered the weight battle rather than some ""doctor"" telling you what you ""should do."
2,Not for me...,"I saw Julia Havey on an episode of ""I Lost It"" on Discovery Health and thought she was inspiring and I decided to purchase the book.I can see where if you are an overweight person that has lost ALL hope, that this book could provide some help. Her extreme behaviors surrounding her unsuccessful weight loss attempts are foreign to me. I have always been ""chubby"", but have never let food control my life to the extent that Ms. Havey did.Pair that with the fact that, quite frankly, the book is poorly written... I had a very difficult time getting through it.I do think her process of eliminating vices one at a time is a good practice, but that is really the only positive tool I could glean.If you are just a normal, run-of-the-mill ""chubby"" person who is looking for inspiration, I don't think you will find it here. I sure didn't."
5,Awaken the Diet Within: From Overweight to Looking Great,"As I read each page I see my life in print. I felt the magic of change coming from the pages into my life. Never before has a book made such a difference. It has given me the confidence to have belief in myself. I care about me and am doing this for me.Julia has the words to give you the power to really make a change for the better. This is the first book out of ALL the diet/motivational books that is really working, Julia is changing the world one pound at a time."
5,She's Been There,"This is a book of practical advice, motivation, and strategy from a woman who knows what it's like to be fat and not want to be. She speaks from experience about all the failed attempts to lose weight and about using food to deaden feelings. Her emphasis on a step by step process to work on changes in one's whole lifestyle has been very motivating to me."
4,Julia is inspiring,"Julia talks to you as a ""real"" person in the ""real"" world. Her approach is realistic by asking you to give up one thing at a time, etc. Her personal story (and pictures) gives me hope that I can do it too. I also read Julia first book, ""Awaken the Diet Within - Take Control of Life"", and recommend reading it as well for a more indepth personal story. After reading the book(s), Julia is still available via emails, her website site, on-line chats, and even personal phone calls if you desire. Julia's approach is not a ""quick fix"" but a life change."
4,What a great lifestyle change men need as well.,"Alright men,here is the truth. You have heard it inside your head over and over, in spite of salad suppers, missed desserts, but with your weight problem which affects your mood, your happiness can be bumped out of your comfort zone.You tried and failed repeatedly-it truly is possible to have a health heart (SOUL)and fantastic relationship with your wife. If your not as happy as you'd like to be theres more likely a good reason- youre weight which will effect your relationship. This book will make you reflect on your own life and the problems that chase you down with a heavy gut hanging over your belt. Reed it once and your relationship with others will soar to greater heights and a super smile, thank you JULIA. ""MEN"" to her your wife you cannot say tomarrow...her name is today.(R.R.)"
2,huge gaps in the story,"If you want to read a weight loss book, this isn't it. Read one by someone who is a nutritionist, and isn't making a buck because they lost weight and have made a career out of this one simple act."
5,Coping with daily struggles,"Julia's book has helped with not only my diet, my 'eating' lifestyle, but more importantly my self esteem. It seems as if I'm reading MY life, the weight gain, the insecurity, the bad marriage. When one person can write a book that not only can stir your emotions but give you such hope that you are headed in the right direction, Thank You for sharing yourself!!! Instead of blaming circumstances, I have found an inner strength from reading how someone from the same background has not used a gimmick, but common sense and self discovery to transform herself, inside and out. A Must Read for anyone with not only weight, but self-esteem issues."
1,Not well made,"While this toy was very cute and my 3 year old really loved it, the Ariel fell apart almost instantly!! Her body crumpled into pieces !! I would not buy this again"
2,broken,This product arrived in bad shape.It had been opened before and someone returned it with visible dog hair all in the package.When I did open it king Triton was broken at the pivot point.Ariel and King Triton both have movable bodies. They are easily broken.I would not recommend because they are not going to last.
4,Great cake decor,"I used these to decorate my daughters birthday cake. Fantastic, and worth the money. My daughter still plays with the characters. So I got a 2 for 1 value."
1,Arrived broken,Looks like a cute set but ours got here in pretty bad shape. The box was beaten up and Ariel's arm was totally off her body. It was really frustrating because I had ordered it as a birthday gift to be given the next day.
1,just plain awful,"This was a horrible book! The recipes in this book were loaded with too much salt and other spices. Justin Wilson tries to cover up his lack of cooking skills with spice. Also, his endless 'cajun' stories were boring and took up too much space in the book. Besides, they just weren't funny. This is NOT a book to buy. I'd give it NO stars if I could."
3,"Functional enough, crappy strap","I haul my IBM Thinkpad T60 for work and a light load of papers and tools in this daily to work. I replaced a backpack with this but I'm really thinking of going back to the backpack.The strap on the bag is not removable and constantly twists up on me. There is an adjustable ""bite clamp"" that you can use to take up slack in the strap, but it constantly slips and the strap extends to full length again.The pockets are mostly useful on this, albeit with some really crazy design decisions like a Faraday-cage style shielded pocket for your PDA. Yes, the hax0rz are going to bluesniff you! Protect yourself!I'd say overall pass on this bag, and spend a little more money. The price point is tempting on this but I wish I had spent a little more and gotten something without the faults of this.I have also contacted the manufacturer about the defective strap clamp to request an RMA and they never responded to me."
5,I first read this series,when I was a teenager and it has taken me about 50 years to collect all of the volumes for myself. This should give you an idea of how much I enjoy it.
4,Thorough,This book provides a thorough study of the theory that imperial nations develop from the frontiers (the edges of previous empires). There are good history lessons.
5,Makita Service is Fantastic,"Well, after building 37 woodduck houses, an oak chest, and a 525 square foot enclosed deck, with 80-90% of the work done by this saw, I needed to take it in for service. I probably put more hours on this saw than my car in the last 4 months.I was getting a bit of a grinding sound from the mitre table when I adjusted the angle. The saw still worked fine, but I didn't want to damage it with use. I dropped it off this morning, and at 1:30 pm, it was already fixed, under warranty.The service people were extremely pleasant to work with; I have no fears if it needs fixing again, even if I have to pay for it next time."
4,"very, very picky","I own the LS1013 and it is a great saw. I'm a carpenter and furniture builder with strict tolerances. Out of the box, my saw was set up with no needed adjustments. The angles were dead on, with minimal runout. A couple of bothersome points; the blade guard can get in the way when sliding inwards cutting mouldings and base, also the stops do have some play in them. The dust bag is pretty worthless in my opinion. I like how it has a stop at 31.6 for cutting crown moulding. Many don't offer this feature. The LS1013 slides effortlessly, the soft start is great and doesn't kick hard when you release the trigger. The blade is excellent (makita makes great blades). A friend of mine is a chairmaker who often writes articles for fine woodworking magazine. He also owns an LS1013. Great saw for the money, and haven't had any problems yet. If your looking for an accurate dual bevel sliding saw for $500 this is the best 10"" saw on the market."
5,Fastastic Machine,"I have been using this saw for two years in my woodwork shop. I find it being the most used piece of equipment in my shop (I have two table saws, jointer, drill press, etc.). It is extremely accurate and smooth. Put a Forrest blade in it and it will perform like ""slicing butter"". By far the best buy for quality cuts.""tough call"" on April 29, 2000 was either using a totally different piece of equipment than the rest of us, or he had too much ""hot sauce"" on his crawfish??"
4,"Great Tool, But Could Use More Power","I just finished a very long session with the Makita: more than 250 hard maple planks that I'm milling into flooring. I'm very satisfied. The saw is very well designed, the action is smooth, and the fences were set up accurate right out of the box. I traded up from a Dewalt 12-inch (non-sliding). With the non-sliding saw, I'd have to flip wide boards and clean them up later with the table saw. With the Makita, I can cross-cut 12-inch wide planks, no table saw necessary. The trigger lock mechanism takes some getting used to, but once you've used it awhile, you get the hang of it. My only real complaint is that the saw could use a more powerful motor (how about a 15-amp like the 12-inch)."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I'M A CABINET MAKER OF 20+ YEARS, AND HAVE ALWAYS LIKED THE QUALITY AND LONGEVITY OF MAKITA TOOLS.HOWEVER , I WAS DISSAPOINTED WHEN I PURCHASED THE LS1013.AFTER UNPACKING AND SETTING UP , I TRIED A CUT. IT MADE A BUEATIFULLY SMOOTH CUT,BUT IT WAS NOT A TRUE 90. THE MITER GUAGE WAS OFF ABOUT 1/2 A DEGREE, ALSO THE SAW WOULD BIND UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CUTTING STROKE.THESE THINGS ARE FIXABLE, BUT I BELEIVE WHEN YOU SPEND [MONEY],IT SHOULDN'T NEED FIXING.I RETURNED THE SAW TO THE STORE WHERE I PURCHASED IT, AND GOT CREDIT FOR IT.COULD HAVE BEEN A BAD UNIT, THE DEMO MODEL WORKED SMOOTHER THAN THE ONE I HAD TAKEN. I WAS SURPRISED AND BUMMED, FIRST TIME MAKITA LET ME DOWN."
4,its okay but its not great,"I've owned this saw for three + years now. I thought it was great out of the box but it never was dead on accurate. I use to try and square the fence on a regular basis, but now I just live W/ it and mark my material. I've learned over time where the blade falls so I cut close & move the material for final cut. After 3 years of hard use it still holds up well except the flip of the double bevel is becoming very stiff when jumping from 45 left to 45 right or vise versa. I love the bigtable work area & I added a self adhesive tape measure to the fence so I can quick chop anything left or right up to 10"" ( all chop and table saws should have this feature. ) I'm in the market for a new saw so I'm looking to either buy it again or try the bosch, but the reviews didn""t sound to good + I thought I read that it is being discontinued.Good luck & keep those fingers clear.Handymanrandy.com"
2,Beware the Devil is in the Bevel,"This is a great saw if you do not need a 45 degree bevel. Hitachi is a dual, this is a one way bevel saw.. The bad news is: The motor housing hits.. yes hits the work piece at a 45 degree bevel.. stops dead.. and is a horrid design flaw. Thought you'd like to know..! This occured on my first 45, a rake wall.. 12x12 with a 45 degree 2x6 cut. This is when all the reviews .. just don't add up! Sent Back and ordered the 10"" Hitachi dual slider. Owner home builder."
5,Simply the Best,"I have used them all and none have the quality, durabality, and accuracy as the Makita. It is simply the best. Their 12 inch is top notch as well, but if you compare cutting capacity with the Makita 10 inch versus the Makita 12 inch or Dewalt 12 inch, you will see there is no big advantage."
1,This saw not as good as the Hitachi C10FSH with Laser.,"Didn't want to review until I used both this and the Hitachi laser dual slider (Hitachi C10FSH 10"" Dual Bevel Slide Compound with Laser) for at least a few months. Both saws are great. However, I give Hitachi the extra endorsement because:1. Hitachi can bevel to the right and left (dual bevel). The Makita can't. If you do trim often, you will appreciate this feature.2. No laser on the Makita. The laser on the Hitachi is dead on. No need to lift, check and recheck. This is a time saver and it is very accurate.3. Slide action on the Hitachi is smoother than the Makita.4. Hitachi has a softer start and is quieter.This is a good saw, but the Hitachi a better saw for an extra $30 which gets you a better saw plus dual bevel and laser.I have been cutting laminate flooring, trim and cabinet faceframes with both for a few months. All my contractors prefer the Hitachi.Good luck shopping!"
4,Fine Prokofiev,"This all-too-seldom heard symphony was a pleasure to find on CD, and the Ukrainians got it just right, with feeling and enthusiasm, on a technically well-made disc."
2,not worth the money,"This lil piece of worthless junk was hardly worth the 20 dollars i spent for it. True it is small and does light up when in use, but this is all a bunch of gimmicks that serve no purpose. I was a fool to buy this, and would have been much happier buying a five dollar optical mouse. If you want to go portable, I suggest buying a retractable mouse for 10, and spend the extra ten bucks go out and celebrate your wise decision on not buying it. Do not waste your money on this because you will be filled with regret like me."
3,Glad I Rented It and Didn't Buy Ut,"The cover caught my attention while surfing the web for foreign movies and then I ran into it at the video store the next day.I will be the first to admit that I enjoy the content/story of a movie first, followed by the photography, sound and interpretations.Although I was intrigued by the overweight character and a few of the comical situations - his appearance while smudged with soot, the scenes with the crucifixes and his repetition of ""He wrote poetry until he went nuts"", while describing his son in the mental institution, it was not until I sat through the Director's Comments after viewing the movie that I understood many of the scenes. Much of it had to do with the economic and social history of Sweden. Since I know next to nothing about such, I did not understand the movie while watching it. Now that I understand much of the symbolism I would describe it as marginally interesting."
5,Great Job,"Speedy service, received in a day or so. One of the best movies these eyes have seen. Movie has very little dialogue but it doesn't need it, touches on life changing thoughts."
2,different things to different people,"A very bizarre, artsy Swedish film. It is more visually driven than plot driven. I could not make it past the 30 minute mark. I gather that the point has something to do with things in life being confusing and a sense of dissatisfaction with the way life goes, a lack of connections with things that are important, for example. It could technically be interpreted to mean many things to many different people, which is the one really beautiful thing about this loosely organized film."
2,I Didn't Get It,"Some interesting dialogue sprinkled about within a mostly nonsensical, dull, and slow plot. Also, the whole thing is in Swedish with hard to read English subtitles. Blah. The film critics will love this one because it gives them bizarre, convoluted material upon which to ponder self-importantly. It's really not worth pondering, though."
2,MADE ME CRY...,"If it was the filmakers intention to bore the viewer to tears, then he made a fantastic film. I like avant garde filmaking and never cared for hollywood wiz bang blockbusters but this film was so painfully boring it made me cry. Did the filmaker succeed in his goal for the film? In my opinion yes."
3,"OK, but pales in comparison to the rest of his work","I love Tony MacAlpine. To me he is one of the gods of guitar. Edge of Insanity, Maximum Security, Evolution, Premonition, even Chromaticity, all have great stuff. I highly recommend his stuff in general.That said, I think this album is weak. He is a good guitar player as always, but the tunes here are light and simple, this is neither the heavy metal nor the complex jazz influenced stuff he has been known to do. I listened to this, and although not a single song was ""bad"", they were all kind of cookie cutter attempts at making something groovy, like he was experimenting with glam rock or something. Flashy and simple tunes from someone known for calculated and serious performance.Some people might enjoy this CD; I think it has more mainstream appeal, but it isn't something I find myself ever listening to. I can't pin down what's wrong with it, it doesn't suck, but it just doesn't click.Check out one of his many better albums."
3,A little defeat for this guitar talent,"In my opinion, this is a bad outcome from Macalpine but this depend on my expectations from Tony's works. When an artist make a masterpiece as ""Maximum security"" it's quite impossible to keep that high-level with the following records. Moreover the engineering and production of the album could have been better and perhaps those days were not the best days for Tony. Anyway the record is easy listening but too maestoso and not much energetic and no track's standing out from the others. Buy it only if you are a fan of Tony or if you've already ""Maximum security"" and would like something more relaxed."
4,Surprisingly good,"This recording was quiet a surprise, having never heard the New Zealand Symphonic Orchestra, I can only describe the interpretation of the Mathis-Symphony as excellent. Especial atention should be paid to the brass section which makes Hindemith's vigorous brass writing sound brilliantly. As a matter of fact they sometimes overshadow the rest of the orchestra, but then again that might have been the composers intention. The recordings of Nobilissima Visione and Symphonic metamorphosis also deserve no less credit. All in one, this is an excellent choice for those who want to get to know Paul Hindemith's music."
3,Mobile Edge - great but,I have Mobile Edge bag that has taken a beating and was replacing it. I have been very happy this bag but the new version has magnets on the flap that seals it. My older bag has plastic front clasps that have worked well and did not fail. This one has some weak magnets which give way. Can someone tell me that someone in the new design may have suggested - Magnets anywhere near a computer product - probably not a good idea.
3,not very helpful,I bought this product and I regret it. First Aid for Step 2 ck would have done a better job. This book lacks too much detail to be the only referral.
4,STEP 3 PREPERATION,A very good book to review for step 3. Its not enough by its self but a very good complement to other books like Swanson Family Medicine.
2,Kindle Edition: Inaccessible,"A superficial run-through of what you need to know for Step 3, the ""standard"" for studying but naturally contains substantial errors.ALERT: The kindle edition is currently not readable via the Amazon Cloud Reader. It intermittently becomes unloadable, and when it does load, graphics do not appear (""When calcium is [arrow error] then tetany results""). Pretty useless."
3,worst in the series,"I had high hopes for First Aid for Step 3, after using the series in the other step exams. I was highly disappointed as this book leaves out so much important information, and actually some of the information it does include is blatantly wrong (caused me to give wrong answers on the QBanks). I don't trust it!"
2,medium quality,"i thought that this book would be great as the for step 1 or cs,but to be honest the information is very concise and half informative , i beleive that this book is not enough for step 3 ,iam disappointed"
3,Not what I'd expect from First Aid,"This book is fine in the context of several others, and the cases (as everyone else points out in their reviews) are useful. However, the rest leaves out a lot of key management information and includes a lot of low-yield information."
1,"Help! After reading this, I need first aid.","Difficult to follow. Missing alot of important areas. Shallow coverage. Too many pages.Recommend you buy instead: Strong Medicine for Step 3 by Joseph R. DiCostanzo,$29.95; 266 pages, Mosby-Year Book ISBN: 1560536314."
4,First Aid Step 3,"Very colorful and eye-catching. Has the feel of First Aid Step 2 CS mixed with info from CK, but it's shorter. NOT comprehensive and sometimes lacking. Good review book if you just need a refresher course. Step 1 and Step 2 First Aids can fill in the rest if you need more detail."
4,Succint and Sufficient,"Broad enough to cover the major topics, and still light enough on content not to bog you down."
4,Good Overall Review Book for Step 3.,"This book does an overall decent job with reviewing material for USMLE Step 3. The MCQ review is comparable to Crush Step 3, but I probably favor Crush a little more. The CCS review is nice in that it is short and quick and comprehensive to just about any case likely to show up on the exam. It still lacks some of the detail required for the exam, but overall is a good choice for review. Since it has review for both MCQ and CCS, you won't need to buy Crush or Usmleworld CCS which saves you money. You will still need to practice questions and CCS cases so its a good idea to get Kaplan qbank or qbook along with usmlesteps123 CCS cases."
3,UW will do the trick!!!,"To pass this exam you will probably only need to go over all U-World qbank. First-aid may help if you feel insecure. I read it front to back, but in hindsight I don't think it was worth it or that it contributed in any significant score to final performance ... 99/235."
5,Great resource to review CCS-style mini cases,"I used the First Aid for the USMLE Step 3 along with Kaplan Q-bank and did very well on the exam. This book was great to have handy and review when time permitted. I studied all of the CCS cases in the back of the book and found that to be the best resource. Every CCS case I had on the exam could be found in this book. I don't recommend this as your only study source, but it is EXCELLENT for the CCS case review."
3,New edition is much improved but still very insufficient,"70 pages were added to this new (3rd) edition, so it covers more diseases now - for example, it includes information about cardiomyopathies and about pheochromocytoma, sorely missing in the previous edition.also, this edition contains many more pictures (they are in full color now), as well as integrated mini-cases.I have compared this edition of 'FA for step 3' to the 7th edition of 'FA for step 2 ck' and found that, for example, there is almost nothing about the prevention of endocarditis in the second one, and almost 1 page about it - in the first one.on the other hand, 'FA for step 2 ck' has detailed information about cervical cancer which is absent in 'FA for step 3'.there are some overlaps - some tables (about fractures, immunodeficiencies, and so on) in 'FA for step 3' are borrowed from 'FA for step 2CK'.I guess even this edition of 'FA for step 3' should have at least twice more pages to cover everything you need for step 3."
3,Only as a supplement for other more thorough materials,"Compared to First aid for step 1 or step 2 CS, this is somewhat dangerously abbreviated and overly simplified. But since we all know not to depend on these when you are step 3 level I would say it is fine. Important to study from ""USMLE world"" though and use this for a very very fast review."
3,Great hypothesis but could have been shorter.,"Stanley obviously knows his stuff (and seems, at times, to be somewhat impressed with himself), but the book was too long for what he had to say. However, I did find his ideas interesting. I was especially intrigued by his assessment of the science of anthropology, and how it lags behind broader paleontological theory. Generally, the book was a good read, even though I felt compelled to skim some sections that seemed overly detailed."
3,"Interesting Ideas, Less-than-Compelling Style","It took me a while to slog through this book. Not being an expert in the field, I found myself a bit annoyed at the author's constant reminders of how revolutionary his thinking is. Maybe he is a gianty in his field, I have no idea. But continually being told so was a bit tedious.Other than that, the thesis is very impressive. The idea that the emergence of the isthmus of Panama could provoke a series of events that resulted in the emergence of our direct anecstors is really staggering. Our species turns out to be fairly accidental, a sobering fact.The different themes are organized backwards by the author, so that the most fundamental and shocking things come last. I don't think this strategy works too well. It may be more dramatic, but the overall coherence and unity of the book suffers. And the writing style is fairly mediocre. I would enjoy seeing a better writer tackle the same subjects.All in all, I would hesitatingly recommeend."
3,Marred by mistake,"For me, the book is marred by the following mistake (Chapter 4, page 95):: Oxygen comes in two varieties, or isotopes: oxygen 16 and oxygen 18.: Oxygen 18 has two more protons than oxygen 16. Although protons are: chemically inert, they add weight to the oxygen atom. ...Even to this non-physicist non-chemist layman, it should be ""neutron"" instead of ""proton"". The fact that the word is used twice indicates that this is not a mere typo.A mistake like this makes one wonder what else is wrong in the book. Not being a specialist in any of the areas referenced by the text, there is no way of telling short of herculean investigations."
4,EXCELLENT STRIPPER FILM,"MARIA FORD DOES A BANG UP JOB PLAYING A STRIPPER INVOLVED IN MURDER IN THIS FILM. SHE ALSO CHOREOGRAPHED THE DANCES WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER DONE THAT THOSE IN DEMI M OOR'E ""SHOWGIRLS."""
2,Alamo-philes will probably LOVE it,"Chariton is another writer who is obsessed with the Alamo and this takes away from what this book could have been. Chariton is DETERMINED TO PROVE that Crockett fell fighting ala John Wayne/Fess Parker and this takes up a good portion of the book. Wallace, GET OVER IT ! Chariton even has a photo of Wayne taken from the film THE ALAMO and tries to compare Wayne and Crockett ! This gives you an idea of the mentality of the writer and this book ! If he had left out these silly comparisons, this would be a more readable work. Historians of the Mexican side of the Texas War will notice how Chariton seems to ignore or even discredit the Mexican sources. Ahem, Mr. Chariton, do I detect a bit of ""anti-Mexican"" sentiment here ? Yes, we KNOW you are a ""NATIVE TEXAN"" Mr. Chariton, you remind us constantly. But if you wanted to make this a BETTER book, you should have spent more time in FACT, not opinion. And just a little reminder, THE MEXICANS WON AT THE ALAMO !"
1,It's really a crime...,"...how Dickinson is still remembered today. There have been many bad poets in the world's history; Dickinson was about the worst. Buried in smug contempt and suffused with undeserved egotism, Dickinson's poems show not even the most minimal grasp of the English language. How so many people mistake Dickinson's muffled ignorance for thought is beyond me."
3,Consider a newer collection...,"Just discovering Dickinson, I was content with this Johnson collection, until I read more about Emily. Most every scholar refers to her poems using the newer Franklin collection numbering system. They will make a comment on a poem and add (F213), meaning poem #213 in the Franklin collection, leaving me to search for the Johnson corresponding number, either by a 'first line index' or internet concordence. Not handy.For casual reading, the Johnson collection is fine. The poems, however, beg a deeper look: the context of Emily's life. I recommend the Habegger biography: dense but rich.My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson (Modern Library Paperbacks)).To keep open that option of further reading, get the Franklin collection.PS The Kindle version may not be Franklin...not sure if that mislabeling is sorted out. Read the reviews."
5,Trancendant...,"I couldn't always appreciate Dickenson and perhaps you may not yet be ready to appreciate her work. I can't comment on how it feels to be touched by her because it defies description and rather than try, I would suggest you give her a read. If her metaphor is not lost on you, you will be glad you made the effort. Also, spring for the extra $7 to get the hardcover... if it doesn't speak to you today, tuck it away on a shelf and someday you'll pick it up and wonder why you let it sit for so long..."
5,I've had this book for 10 years now...,"And I still turn to it all the time. It is well-worn and well-read. There are newer editions of Dickinson's poetry, but this relatively compact book feels like an old friend. The use of language and phrasing is divine - so to speak. *smile* I cannot recommend this work enough.Meeting by Accident,We hovered by design -As often as a CenturyAn error so divineIs ratified by Destiny,But Destiny is oldAnd economical of BlissAs Midas is of Gold -"
3,"Great Book, not so great shipping...?","I decided to spend the extra few dollars to get the book new. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book, but it came very chewed up. It kind of takes away from the excitement of having a brand new fresh book."
5,Poetry that will set your hair on fire - a must-have for your library,"As a callow young thing, I lost my lovely hardbound edition and, over the years, missed the presence of Emily Dickinson's poems. So much so that I finally purchased another complete collection of her poetry in order I have it to delve into as needed. Dickinson's work is something many people feel they know and yet, most of us have never turn off the phone, put a do not disturb sign on the door and truly come face-to-face with poetry that will make you, to borrow from Grace Potter, ""wake up, your hair on fire.""So, do your self a favor, make a date with Emily and see what happens."
3,When complete means selection,"""Complete Poems of Emily Dickenson"" is not complete. It is a selection and not even a good selection. There is no good selection available for kindle. However,"" Final Harvest Emily Dickenson"" has poems selected by Thomas H. Johnson and is first rate.This is available in amazon paperback but not kindle."
1,Really terrible as Kindle book,"I bought this book because it says 'optimized for Kindle Dx' or whatever, but it certainly doesn't work on my original Kindle. This is one of those books where you get a huge clot of text, no table of contents, and the poems break in mid-page. No way of accessing individual poems at all. Useless. Why does Amazon charge a premium for a book that could not possibly be more unattractive and unusable on the Kindle?"
5,Another Great Poet..,"Emily Dickinson was a wonderful poet along with Poe...Her poems were mostly about depression, and death. Althought her poems werent found till after she died she still wrote beautiful poems that just want to make you cry."
1,"Good for its time, but...","Now that the wonderful three volume Franklin edition Dickinson's poems exist, I don't see how this old Johnson edition could be taken seriously. Johnson's choices for a particular reading were not always the best -- many of Dickinson's poems don't have a sanctioned ""final"" form from the poet. Franklin's edition presents the poems with all the variations in words and phrases so that the reader could decide which of the variations works best when Dickinson herself was undecided. If you love Emily Dickinson, invest in the Franklin Variorum edition. It's worth every penny of it's rather high price."
2,Jolty...rhythmically unsettled,"This combination of instruments is great for the Hungarian Dances.The timbre of the instruments and the balance between them is very alluring.But, I believe the performers avoided simplicity too much.They never seemed to settle on a rhythm.Tempo-changes are part and parcel of classical music, yes.But for a listner to believe the performer is in control, the performer would need sustainance of a pattern (even an accelerating one) before moving onto the next one.I think this performance lacked flow."
3,DOWNFALL,"Overall the controller worked quite well with games such as Galaga and Space Invaders and pretty much with any game that only required lateral movement and firing. In games that required vertical movement, such as Pac-Man, the controller consistently stuck when you tried to go in the DOWN direction.About 75% of the time you try to go DOWN, there would be a one to two second pause before the controller would respond, which in games like Pac-Man, you die. All other buttons seemed to function properly."
3,Decent,"I purchased these sheets for my bed - I have had them approx. a month. They are ok - but definately nothing to write home about. They are soft and have that ""slippery"" feel to them, which is what you expect w/ a sateen sheet. They did not hold their color very well after a couple washes - and they wrinkle ALOT. (I don't particularly care - but some people do). Overall - an average product - happy w/ the sheets - not worth [...] bucks."
5,Beautiful Egyptian cotton pillowcases,"Loved these pillowcases which were bought to match a sheet and pillowcase set.So warm, soft and comfy and for the price unbeatable."
1,Extremely unimpressed . . .,I was so unimpressed with these sheets that I returned them without even fully opening the package. All I had to do was reach my hand in to feel them and I was instantly disappointed. I have had high thread count sateen sheets before and loved them -- but these were terrible. I honestly didn't feel enough difference between these and cotton sheets to even contemplate keeping them. I requested the return authorization the day they arrived. I am still uncertain as to which sheets to recommend -- but I can firmly say that these are not worth their price. I was so excited based on so many positive reviews and so disappointed when the sheets came . . .
2,Shrinking Problem,"These are very comfortable sheets, but they shrunk, and take a lot of muscle to get all 4 corners of the fitted sheet on the bed. Because it is difficult to get them on securely, a corner will often pop off while we are sleeping."
1,Very disappointed!,"I was shocked when I took these out of the wrapping. They were like burlap and those who said that they were ""soft"" must have gotten different sheets than me. Before I had a chance to return them, they got into the washing machine---I will see if they get softer."
1,Truly Terrible Sheets,"Unless you like to sleep on something similar to canvas, you should avoid these sheets. I was looking to replace a very soft set of sheets for my bed. I ordered these sheets after reading the description and other reviews. These sheets are not smooth or soft and truly do remind me of canvas.I did many washing cycles (at least 10), but the sheets did not improve.I don't typically write negative reviews, but I can't begin to express my disappointment with these sheets and hope I can stop others from making my mistake.If I hadn't washed them so many times trying to soften them up, I would have tried to return them."
2,Not what I expected,"I have never found sheets this thick or rough. Egyptian cotton sheets that I have bought in the past have been soft and thin, but warm. These are obnoxiously thick, I tried washing them and I think it made them worse. If I wanted sheets this thick, I'd have ordered flannel because then they would have at least been soft."
4,Great Sheets but check the seams,Very satisfied with the quality of the sheets EXCEPT that on one of the pillow cases there was a 4 inch seperation on one of seams. This must have been missed by their quality control. It wasn't worth the hassel of returning it so I did a hand sewn repair.
5,Very comfortable,"These sheets are still a little stiff, but very smooth and comfortable. I'm very happy with them."
5,Sleeping in heaven!,"I absolutely love this sheet set!!! I will never buy another brand. I purchased the ""chocolate"" color. They are more ""dark chocolate"" than milk chocolate. But the color is very rich and beautiful. I read reviews that said they were not soft or were scratchy. My sheets are anything but scratchy. They are not flannel-soft but they are smooth as butter. I love them, love them, love them!!!! I definitely recommend these sheets."
3,soft but do not feel like 500 thread count,"They are a bit crispy and not as soft as usual 500 thread count. The price is in line with the quality. The color, however, is beautiful."
2,disappointed,"After reading the reviews I was anxious to try these out. After four washes I have to say I am incredibly disappointed in the way they have held up. The pilling and scratchiness is so bad I've removed them and won't be using them anymore. Initially they are shiny, turning softer after additional washes, but as I said - the pilling!! I've had sheets hold up better that were less expensive and lower thread count. I love the ample sizing of the sheets but won't be buying anymore of these sets.A strange thought, but I'm curious if the differences in the reviews has anything to do with the color or where they are manufactured. Mine were thyme."
2,Constantly shrinking over time,"At first we loved these sheets. We have a thick king-size mattress and they fit nicely--at least at first. Please understand, our mattress is not one of those insanely thick mattresses, just what seems normal for a modern, comfortable bed. The sheets were soft and we didn't have the problem that others noted with pilling. However, over time they continue to shrink each time we wash them until they no longer fit the bed. Getting the bottom fitted sheet on has become aerobic exercise and they ""pop"" off at least a couple of times each week. I would not recommend these to anyone. After a little over a year, I am going to have to throw them out and buy others."
3,dissapointed,"I purchased two sets of these sheets and washed them right away..they came out extremely wrinkled, and one of the seams came undone on one of the pillowcases. It is very frayed and I'm not sure I can sew them up again properly. These are not as soft as I had expected..I would not buy them again."
3,"Not the best, not the worst",I purchased these sheets looking for that egyptian cotton feeling without the price. Unforunately as one person already stated they were soft to begin with but after washing a few times they actually stiffened up. Not to bad for the price but I wouldn't buy more.
3,Good Sheets,"I'm not going to tell you that these sheets feel at all like sandpaper but they are a bit stiff and, after following one reviewer's suggestion of air drying them, they came our very wrinkled. I have bought Pinzon sheets before and I'n sure these will soften and become more pliable with age but out of the box and after washing they just aren't like some of the Egyptian cotton sheets I've purchased before."
2,Pilling,"These sheets are wonderfully comfortable on first use. However they do start to pill rather quickly. Because they were so comfortable, I bought a second set. Then the pilling started. They do not interfere with the comfort as yet, just find it a little disconcerting."
2,Bad pilling,"These sheets are fine enough, but I expected more. I guess you get what you pay for. Bad pilling after third washing. Also, the ""sand"" color I ordered is a bit yellow for my taste."
2,I don't like sleeping on sand paper,"This sheets were very soft the first few times we used them. However, after washing the product 6-8 times they began to pile up and now are very coarse. I thought I was purchasing a high quality product but after 6 months of use I would not recommend these sheets, unless you like sleeping on 40 grit sand paper."
3,These are not plum!,"I purchased these sheets in plum, hoping for a deep plum/aubergine color as portrayed in the product picture. Unfortunately they are much more of a royal purple. I thought the texture and the quality felt good though."
4,Almost Perfect Sheets,"Got the bluish color and I like it. The material seems sturdy and durable and it is relatively soft. If a little softer, I would have given it 5 stars. I will probably order another set of these as they do seem to be good quality sheets."
1,"Fabric feels nice, but...","These sheets feel very nice, but one of the pillow cases split a seam on the second wash and the fitted sheet has now shrunk to not fitting on the bed. Would not recommend at all. Very disappointing."
5,superb,"These are high quality, super soft, ultra comfortable sheets. How somebody could even complain about these is beyond me. I already purchased a second pair and will likely be getting a third."
2,Fabulous except where there's pilling,"I'm so disappointed with these Pinzon sheets. At first they seemed perfect--great feel to the touch, luxurious sheen, beautiful rich chocolate color 500 thread Egyptian cotton King sheets. I had previously purchased the Pinzon 500-thread in mint color a couple of years ago in Queen, and have been just thrilled with their performance.But with these, after about 4 washings, I noticed the fabric is rough where our bodies usually rest on the sheets. Everywhere else, still smooth and silky. The search for no-fail luxury sheets continues I guess. And these were not cheap!"
1,Soft as Sand Paper,"This item is adverstised as ""500-Thread-Count"", but they feel more like course, stiff canvas. Definitely NOT even close to 500-Thread-Count. I've owned many sets of sheets with 500-Thread-Count that were much softer and had a much brighter sheen than these sheets."
4,Good Started Violin,It meet my daughter begining expectations. However all new violinist need to know that they need to scratch the rosen with a nife and rub it on the bow to make it work.
3,Student violin,"I'd have to say, the quality of the violin is great when you can get it to hold a note. My biggest problem with this violin had pegs that didn't really hold in place very well, so it was constantly throwing itself out of tune and needed a lot of upkeep. Overall though it is still a good violin."
5,Nice Quality,We love the two violins. My kids can't wait to start their lessons and have already begun practicing with them. Very nice quality...amazing price!!!
2,No bridge,"Makes no sense that we bought this without a bridge. Though inexpensive, it did not say there was no bridge."
3,okay,"This is my first violin and since I bought it cheap, I wasn't expecting much. My violin teacher said that it sounded just fine for being what the price was. Me and my violin teacher both think that it would be just fine for a starter violin. It didn't come with a bridge though and my E-string broke on the first try of it being tuned. Overall I was pleased with the violin but I wouldn't give it five stars. I will give it a three because it didn't come with the bridge which is pretty much the most important part of the violin if you want to get any sound out of it."
5,Beginner Violin,"We were so pleasantly surprised when we received this fairly inexpensive product. We bought this violin as a donation for our daughter's students. She volunteers to teach special learners who would not otherwise be able to afford a violin. The violin, case, and rosin all were in great shape and much appreciated! We liked it so much, we bought two!"
3,Just ok,"The violin seems ablittle cheap. We can't get the bridge installed without breaking a string or two. Without the bridge and the strings broken/loose, we haven't really been able to play it."
1,Broke within 5 minutes,"I bought this thing and it didnt even have the bridge set in it. Also the bridge had no angle to it so it wouldn't play notes right. The bow doesnt even work on a 200 dollar violin. Dont bother with this, go to a real violin store."
3,Violin,Did you know that violins are forged in the fires of Mordor? They are actual sinister products that should not be taken likely
1,Bad....,"I expected something so much better, but I got the worst. I never played the violin in my life,and could tell that I didn't want to be playing out of this thing. I read the review and it sounded good, but it I think it was ment for another violin! It is cheap and it literally is! I rated it one star because it wouldn't let me rate it a zero. However,austin bazaar customer service was quick on answering my return questions."
1,Don't buy it,looks like a toy violin. very poor quality. the strings weren't attached. I couldn't use it. I knew it's cheap but didn't expect that such horrible quality.
3,Not as good as I expected,"I expected wooden normal violin but I got a Synthetic one. The sound is OK but the shape is so strange that when i shoved it to an expert he started to laugh. Violin is very flat and thin. The bow is also OK and the case is the only thing that i really liked.So, this violin is the real beginner STUDENT violin and not more. I have been playing violin for 4 years but I haven't seen such strange-shaped one.It's all Chinese product."
4,Kindness,I bought this product for the intention to just play along with music by ear and learn some tunes in a fun inexpensive way. It came with some minor flaws that the seller and amazon amazingly took care of right away! They sent a new package that was so kind and thoughtfull of them including rosen strings and a new bottom part (not sure what its called) string holder tuner thingy! In my life i find acts like that in business so comendable and kind i am greatfull to TRY TO PLAY this instrument & find it just right for any beginner!
5,exactly as described and brought a wonderful smile as a surprise,this is a gift - and when she opened it her smile was worth a million $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ We should all make memories along lifes path to carry us thru the rough times
3,ViolinReview,"When the violin arrived, the pegs were a little loose, the strings came off and had to be re-strung. Aside from that, the violin was okay."
1,unimpressed,I bought this violin because I was considering learning to play. I have never played a classical stringed instrument before but I have played guitar for years now. After assembling the violin I was barely able to produce any sound. This was because the sound peg was lose and freely moving around inside the body. After buying a hemostat at a local hardware store I was able to re-position the sound peg. The sound quality improved slightly after doing this although the violin does not stay in tune. I highly recommend buying this violin as a prop or if you will be preforming primarily for the deaf.
2,Less Than What You Pay For!,"Very disappointed seeing what came in the mail after a week of waiting for it to get to my home. The violin came fully assembled but was missing a string that must have broken while in the mail. The rosin crumbled in my hands upon attempting to use it on the bow. Finally, the money I paid for to get the violin and accessories did not even include a digital tuner as wit was advertised with. I will be returning this product immediately and renting from my local store, who I know to be at least reliable. Can't wait to get my money back to invest elsewhere!"
2,Not what I expected,"Cheaply made, but what can I expect for what I paid for it. Pay more and get better quality that you need to play violin."
1,No good,I bought it for my kids music class. This violin couldn't be tuned. The bridge won't stay in place. Ripoff!
5,loved it!,"This movie hammers my funny bone. Loved the true to life aspects that are portrayed. If you have ever spent time in a wheel chair you will understand the humor at a deeper level, if not you will still find it funny/"
4,Good Luck!,At first...wasn't sure where this movie was headed...but as I watched more...it became a better movie. The actors do the best they can...the plot is so-so...but still worth watching.
4,This film is an satisfactory way to spend 96minutes.,I bought this film sight unseen as that is the only way I could see it. No video store had it.{most had never heard of it}And waiting for it to show up on t.v. could take months. I have had mixed results buying films unseen but this one did not disappoint. It won't go down as one of the best I have seen but I don't get the feeling the people behind it were shooting for greatness. They were just trying to tell the story of two men trying to rise above a handicap. And as that it works well. It contains a GREAT deal of bathroom humor. I'm not bothered by it but it's dwelt on to the point it becomes a little tiresome. Otherwise it's an enjoyable film. The performances by Hines and D'Onofrio are VERY good. I found D'Onofrio very belivable as a blind man and most of the films dramatic burden is carried by him. I am sure I'll spend 96 minutes with it agian.
3,Heart Warmer,"I bought this because when Gregory Hines recently died I wanted to see those movies he did that I had missed. Perhaps a poor reason, but better late than never. He was an accomplished actor and dancer. This DVD has a great price on it as well for the entertainment you will get out of it. I was pleasantly surprised. This is one of those feel good sleepers you run across now and then.When Hines, playing a paraplegic, decides to enlist the aid of a blinded football star, played by D' Onofrio, to win a white water race, anything can happen. The friendship that develops is earned through hard work and the realization that no matter what, we can move forward with our lives.Fans of movies like ""Brian's Song"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""Cool Runnings"", and ""Amazing Grace"" should enjoy it. Other than some ocassional bad language the movie is suitable for most the family."
4,Four stars for the warm-fuzzy!,"What a ""happy movie!"" Okay, so I'm a bit of a ""Pollyanna,"" but I landed on this movie by chance one evening channel-surfing and found myself on the edge of my chair, chin resting on my hands, big grin across my face -- it's a ""happy"" movie ... I laughed, I cried -- I liked it so much I made my husband watch it with me the next night -- we laughed, we cried ... It's got humor (some kind of raunchy, but funny in its context), it's got relationship stuff, overcoming adversity stuff, struggles, victories -- it just made me feel ""happy."" Some of the situations these guys get into made us laugh out loud. I really, really liked the movie. Oh, and what a treat, for a former Barney Miller fan, to see good ol' Max Gail on screen! Great fun, great movie."
5,Totally Underrated!!,"This is a fabulous ""feel good"" movie. I've watched it a dozen times and it's still a favorite to pop in the VCR when company comes calling. This movie never got the publicity it deserved so it's pretty much a surprise when I play it for guests. Then, everyone wants a copy. I probably would never have heard of it myself if my mom hadn't been an extra in it. It was filmed in Winchester Bay, Oregon where my mom had a gift shop."
4,Great for party,"Got these for an ""Italy Party"" as we had just returned from a trip there. Our friends loved them as there was a nice variety."
3,"It is ok, but not what I was looking for.","I am doing research on ""between Wars"" aviation. In general, this book is ok, but doesn't give me any new information that I don't already have. If you have a general interest in U.S. aviation history, then this book is ok, but not if you are a serious historian."
5,"If you want to learn the Ives quartets, get this CD","This is an excellent recording of the Ives quartets, pieces which are very approachable, classically, compared to the rest of Ives' works. The quartet, recorded in their accustomed home at Brandeis, is very well balanced, and the beautiful viola and cello playing is heard clearly. The short pieces 'Hymn' and 'Halowe'en' are a bonus."
1,sucked,"dumbest movie ever, i should have been shot for setting through the whole thing, i have to add six more words to post this stupid crap"
3,Iron Sky,The effects were great! Storywise I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at a theater. Good popcorn B movie!
1,Plot? We don't need no stinkin' plot.,"Wow, this rates in the C range. Not even a B movie in my opinion. Nazis hiding on the moon finally decide to come home and take over? The box cover was the best thing going here."
1,Horrible movie,This movie sucked do not get it. Bad production value and horrible acting. I think any 5 star reviews were written by the actors in this movie or amazon itself. This is a really really bad movie
2,Dissapointing,For some reason I expected more from this movie. It's difficult to explain my dissatisfaction without giving away much of the plot. I suggest waiting until it is on free TV.
3,Iron Sky,"A wonderful premise. I had waited literally for years to finally see this, but was somewhat disappointed at the script."
3,I found it worth the money,I found this DVD fun to watch . As alway it came on time and in good order no problems.
4,Amazing movie!,"Loved the movie. I hosted a screening of it in Portland, and was really happy to see it finally arrive on Blu-ray in the US. It would have been nice if it included a digital copy though..."
3,Iron Sky,"Very disappointed. The acting was fair at best. The Germans do the best acting of all. The special affects are there, but not enough of them. The attack on the earth was done okay - but could have used more interaction along the lines of ID4 or the like. A believable movie done that was okay to watch - once - but the unbelievable scenes somewhat ruin it. I waited a long time for this movie and was let down. Could have been a lot better with more CGI tossed in."
2,The trailer is the best part,To bad.. I thought it was going to a fun flick in the vein of Mars Attacks...no such luckI had high hopes..camp is one thing..a lack of respect for your audience is another. Lazy writing and editing..with many needles scenes as though they were trying to run out the clock.
1,Terrible.,"Movie was terrible. Don't bother watching it. Didn't even finish it...waste of my time. I though it was a good plot, but I was wrong."
2,not so hot,"I was disapointed. I may have set my expectations too high. Quality was good, story not so much. Without a dought worth a look, but, ,,,,,,,,,,"
4,Destined to be a cult classic?,"Somehow this movie managed to deliver the farcical without slipping into the painfully stupid. Perhaps it was the novel combination of traditional WW2 role caricatures, steampunk technology visualization, and a variety of cultural, political, and sci-fi allusions?The special effects were variable in quality, but surprisingly good overall.Whether this one hits your funny bone is sure to be a matter of chance, but if ""(modestly) intelligent farce"" is a label that makes sense to you, ""Iron Sky"" could be for you!"
3,Not Bad for a Low Budget Epic,"Clever twists, campy humor, and a bit of quirkiness are what I have come to expect from these guys and Iron Sky delivers pretty much what I expected. Sure, they are just having a bit of fun more than telling a real literary kind of story, but if I wanted that I would have rented Lord of the Rings. I thought that the romantic storyline was handled better than I was expecting.There was a strain of anti-americanism in the film I didn't much care for, but it was passing and cut with humor so it didn't ruin the movie for me."
1,Stupid Movie,"I'm a big SciFi fan but this movie is just stupid...Basically, some European Liberal that Views America as the world police with Sarah Palin at the helm. Then they made a movie that Hitlers army retreated to the moon in 1945 and now they're back, to face the evil American Empire...Gimme a break...."
1,Please help these actors get their careers back,"How did these actors get through all of these scenes without busting up. Really, the story is so much in need."
4,"Love it, and since its a Euro production I'll forgive the hit on Palin.","Very funny, surprisingly good CGI and costumes. Since this is a Euro/Aussie production making the USA the heavy (in a funny way) is to be expected.Best Finnish, German, Australian film production I've ever seen."
2,Would have been a great 30minute movie,"I saw the trailer for this a few months ago, and was excited to see it available on Amazon Instant Video. All of the scenes on the moon, the space battles, and the invasion in NY are well done. Costuming is good and decent acting.It all falls apart though with several interludes where they focus on a campaign manager and the President of the US. The scenes are poorly written, poorly acted, and do little to move the story forward. I really wish this would have just been a straight-forward Moon-Nazis-Invasion movie."
1,"Great concept, poorly executed","Movie had some funny moments but predominantly dragged on. The humor was corny, the plot muddled, the ending lost on me. It really SEEMED interesting from the trailers, very novel idea, but just dragged in between too few good parts, which were mostly shown in the trailer.Waste of money."
2,Glad I only rented it,"Cover looked good, description sounded good, movie was barely OK and sometimes hard to watch. Not a bad premise but could have been much better. Glad I only rented it. The whole idea of Nazi's colonizing the dark side of the moon waiting for an opportunity to invade earth to take over after losing WW2 is hard to swallow, even if you are good at suspending reality and getting into imagination."
2,less than impressed,"I was looking forward to this movie when it was originally released in theaters but the release was so limited and lasted not that long at all that I never got to see it I knew it was going to be a spoof type sci fi flick but...the story line sucked, the dialogue dragged and while I'll freely admit I enjoyed the lead actresses performance somewhat...if only because of my weakness for blondes..by and large I just got to say this one left a bit to be desired. I don't know...maybe it'll grow on me later"
2,Absurb Flick,"While it does have a few moments of humour and some pretty good special effects, it's still an absurb flick and plot line."
4,"""B"" Movie doesn't have to be mean ""bad""...",There is little I appreciate more than a movie that successfully makes fun of itself. Don't go into this expecting a serious big budget sci-fi opus. This is a little film that pretends to be big and provides a lot of laughs. Definitely worth a rent.
2,Iron Sky,"I'm a sucker for campy B-movies. I had high hopes that Iron Sky would be B with a capital B. It was a little too well made to be a true B-movie. But it wasn't good enough for an A rating either. The story line had great potential but didn't really deliver. The acting was ok. I did enjoy the demagoguery of the American Powers That Be. Still, I wouldn't buy it again if given the option. Rent it for $2 and enjoy it."
1,Iron Sky Fail,"Great concept, utterly ruined by nasty political rhetoric. It could have been funny, smart and hip, but if that's what passes for smart and hip, I'll pass. I seldom feel bad about wasting my time watching a movie, but this was one of those times. Straight out of the player and into the trash can.One star because there is no Zero star."
1,The only great thing about this movie was the preview,"Husband endured the whole thing but I gave up 1/3 of the way through. Premise was fantastic and had the potential to be a very funny, over-the-top film. I think I was expecting something campy along the lines of the musical, The Producers. But execution was embarrassing: direction, editing, characterizations-- all clunky. It made me marvel yet again at what actors are willing to do to be onscreen."
1,"Horrible, except for fans of cheesy movies.",I rented this movie knowing that what I was about to watch was going to be very low budget and very non-impressive. My immature side talked me into watching this just so I could say to myself that I watched a movie with Nazi's on the moon that invaded Earth. ...And they did. And of course I was dissapointed in myself for spending the money on such a horribly done movie with a pathetic plot as the credits began to show at the end of the movie. When will I learn?
3,Doesn't play on my TV DVD,"I can't get this damn DVD to play on other than a computer PC! I don't care how much of a cult classic it has become, what is the point If I can't enjoy the movie in my living room?"
1,"Ad is misleading, there is no digital copy",The ad does advertise that there is a digital copy. However the disc I received did not have this feature. And per the return policy of amazon it can't be returned since I removed the wrap. The only way you can know if the digital copy is there is to remove the wrap where you usually find the insert with the code to activate the digital copy. So don't order this item for the extra price of $28 if you are wanting to have the digital copy available. Amazon please update the ad to be consistent with what is really delivered.
4,Funny and Cheesy,So I wasn't expecting much from the movie. I definetly liked it. It was cheesy in the best possible way. I enjoyed watching.
3,Mac Users Beware!,"Loved the movie... Lot's of fun... Hated the digital download, because... I DON'T HAVE ONE! PC only, no way to get it onto a Mac even though I paid for a digital copy. Is it still illegal to make my own digital copy even though I paid for one I couldn't receive?They just need to make this important aspect of the disc clearer. I would have purchased another format if I had known. If downloading and streaming is the future, how about some consideration for this other popular platform..."
3,Iron Sky...less than magnetic,"It was no Rocky Horror, but it's okay if you like camp and have some time to kill. The Nazis were a little weak and ill-prepared, considering they had the expertise to build a civilization on the moon with 65+ years of preparation to conquer Earth. Think Mars Attacks and Space Balls...."
4,It is what it is...,"If you can accept the idea of steampunk nazis on the moon, everything that follows is enjoyable in this campy sci-fi along the same vein as Doc Savage, Buck Rogers and Flash Gordan."
3,"Well-made movie, for a low budget production","I would give this a solid 3 stars out of 5... I liked the concept of the movie...perhaps in the right hands, it would have become a classic worth watching over and over...but once or twice is enough."
4,Ridiculously good,It is so outrageous it's great. Well done for a b movie. I've watched it several times and it gets better
2,"Cool story line, flat characters","I like the idea, especially as a comedy, but I didn't like one person in it. I also thought they could have done better."
3,Entertaining but uneven,"Dark humor and at times campy, Iron Sky is a good poke at the USA's political scene and of course, who can resist Nazis from the Dark Side of the Moon? There is a twist on the Downfall scene that will make meme-lovers laugh. It certainly evokes the B movie genre with some excellent effects and dark humor."
4,"Schmaltzy, tongue-in-cheek fun...","This is all about light hearted, obvious entertainment...big special effects, gorgeous cheese-cakey leading lady, hopelessly inept Nazi's....this is not great film, people, but it is fun."
2,slightly campy,this slightly campy sci fi flick is not big on science but huge oin fiction although the premise is completely flawesd it does have it's moments good for a laugh or two
4,Awesome film,"Film is awesome. Downfall spoof was funny.Blu-Ray has a problem with the 'Promo' sub-menu. All the links in the sub-menu do not work. I'm guessing that these are the web trailers. The movie, trailer and making of menus all work. Disappointed with the making of portion: a little over 16 minutes of the film being shot. No commentary or dialogue, even subtitled non-English commentary would have been appreciated (movie also). Given the price, the BD was a little skimpy on extras."
1,Worst Movie Ever - almost,"Still more entertaining than 'Nacho Libre', this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only good thing about it is the special effects which are pretty decent considering. Dumb, dumb, dumb."
1,Iron Sky was a steel turd.,"Not only was this movie terrible at so many levels, I ended up paying twice, due to problems with the portal."
3,Interesting movie. Definitely has a 1950's invader movie feel.,"This movie is a mixed bag. I liked some of it. The effects are great, but not consistently so. Some special effects sequences are definitely high on the cheese factor -- and not in a good, noir, or genre way. Just cheesy. There are moments of ""What the ?"" in here too. It left me with a meh feeling. Is it worth your time and money? Probably not, unless you've watched everything else on Amazon, Netflix or Vudu."
2,Iron Sky,"The reviews stated that this movie was a ""B"" movie and they were correct. The movie plot was ok but the scenes were not realistic especially on the dark side of the moon. How do you drive a normal 1945 automobile on the moon?"
3,nazi on the moon!,"A nice little B-movie from Europe, a black comedy with political overtones thrown in for laughs, the special effects and soundtrack was nice, it move along pretty good and was not boring! too bad there is no appreciation for this type of cinema in the States, if you can find this gem ,do your self a favor and watch it lower your expectations and enjoy......"
1,couldn't sit through it,"I'm all for black comedy, tongue in cheek comedy, maybe some general foolishness, but I couldn't sit through it Example: About 25 minutes in the black astronaut is turned white by the Nazis and is sent back to earth. He goes into a black neighborhood and acts Black BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALIZE HE'S BEEN TURNED WHITE. AH TRUE COMIC GENIUS! WHAT COMEDY! WHAT A BRILLIANT SENDUP ON THE HUMAN CONDITION AND RACE RELATIONS! HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA Maybe this would have been funny when I was in 7th grade, not so much now. On second thought, it wouldn't have been funny then either. I rented this because I was home injured and didn't have anything better to do, and in the 3 days of the rental I couldn't bring myself to watch any more Maybe it got better later on, but I wouldn't waste your money to find out"
2,horrible,"Thought this movie would be great! It wasn't , it was really horrible. The movie was not serious but more of a comdey The movie would have done so much better if wasn't a comdey!!"
1,Great Concept. Movie is Awful!,Space Balls meets Blazing Saddles. Should have kept it serious. It had promise but you missed it. Would like to see a more action packed with some serious overtones. The conspiracy theory has always intriqued me.
1,Nazis lose :(,"The Nazis don't even win the war at the end of the movie, so, if you are pro-nazi, don't watch this movie. Also there is an interracial relationship at the end of the movie."
3,not so funny,Stupid ending its not worth .99 don't wast your money and time look else were. Its too bad i can't get my money back.
4,fun bad,okay this is NOT a great film but it is a lot of fun. The special effects are actually quite good and the plot ludiricris but great fun. Whoever plays Sarah Palin did a great job. If you want a film that is entertaining then this is the film for you.
2,OK,"Kind of corny, acting not that great. I kind of got the fealing that it was spoof on science fiction movies. Visual effects were decent."
3,it really was just okay,"i had a different idea of what this movie was going to be like, i think it could have been better"
1,Waste of time,Poor acting.Should this be classified as an out of date satire or slapstick comedy?Either way it fails.One star for effort. Even a poor movie requires planning and someone's hard work.
1,This is truly a awful movie,"This is the new generations Plan nine from Outer Space.I don't care if they made fun of people that think Nazi's went to the moon after WW II, the possibility of Sara Palin being president or even Nazi's in general, just make a good movie.I had some real hopes for this movie. A large chested blonde playing a campy Nazi how could you go wrong with that, but these guys did.If you are looking to make a cult classic take lessons from Rocky Horror.Personally I think these guys need to go back to making movies for the Internet."
1,Do not buy this junk.,"I am at a complete loss to describe how utterly crappy this was. No, I did not watch the whole thing. It was so bad (and not even funny) that I just fast-forwarded for awhile to see if it would get better. Nope. I threw it in the garbage."
1,Utterly Terrible. Wasted Potential.,"I'm not sure if I can articulate how bad this movie is, but I will try. So you've probably seen the trailers for this, just like I have. Nazis from the moon, dirigibles, guns, explosions, satire, Sarah Palin--ripe with comedic potential! Unfortunately Iron Sky didn't deliver on anything that, well, on anything at all really. We have a very sinusoidal and ultimately anti-climactic storyline, boring characters, unfunny jokes, and a lame space battle at the end that you could've just fast-forwarded to and not missed a single thing. This movie had so much potential, but it fails to deliver on any one item. I'm often left wondering what I'm supposed to be watching. Is it a serious space opera? No wait, it's a satire. No wait, it's space noir. I really, really wanted to love this movie. I saw the terrible reviews for this movie before I bought it. But if you're like me, you'll want to watch it anyways and judge for yourself. I suggest you don't get your hopes up."
2,Someone Please Remake This!!!,"I had such high hopes for this film... It had Nazis, it had spaceships, cool artwork, a good trailer, but a HORRIBLE script!! Someone please remake this into a real scifi movie!"
1,Poor Nazis,"I saw ""Iron Sky"" recently. I have not seen it on Blu-Ray or DVD, so I can't comment on whether the ""special features"" make it worth the ""bargain"" price of over $35, but I can tell you what I thought of the movie.I give the movie one star just because the CGI effects were not a total disaster but it's all downhill from there. I know it's meant as a parody of sorts but even as that, it fails. The film is utterly unfunny and un-American. I can't decide what I disliked most: the bastardized version of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" they played during a scene showing President Sarah Palin (that's not a typo) beating U.N. delegates with her red shoe, the African-American actor that played a white man during the majority of the movie or the fact that, in the end, they try to portray, as sympathetic figures, not the Americans, but the Nazis.If you remember only one thing from this review, let it be this: I watched ""Iron Sky"" so you don't have to."
3,B Movie with a entertaining twist,Don't take it seriously and the movie is entertaining. It is playing off of an unsubstantiated claim that a secret Nazi saucer actually did travel to the moon before the Nazi regime was conquered. The acting is based on off-balanced characters and they do a good job. The story is an interesting line of action and bawdy humor. Enjoy it.
3,tough movie to review,"This movie was not what I expected. I have to give it props for concept and special effects and some acting, but I both loved and hated this movie. So, when you do the math, that equals three stars."
4,Accept it for what it is... and it excels at that!,"Face it, this wasn't meant to be the next grade 'A' MEGABLOCKBUSTER. This is a lower budget, independently made 'B' movie.... but what a 'B' movie it is. All things considered, it has great spacial effects, decent actors, a good script.... One of my favorite 'B' Sci Fi films of all time!"
3,Superisingly Funny,"It's a bit wired in the begging and hard to supend you belive about life on the Moon, but if you stick with it you'll be treated to quite a few laugh and suprising ending."
3,Entertaining,"This movie was okay. It was entertaining, on a purely, ""wow this is different"" note. You really have to ignore any and all science, however, to watch it to enjoy it. The special effects are fairly well rendered. The tone and pace are pretty constant and it's pretty funny if you don't take racial, gender, and political jabs too personally. If you're sensitive to jabs on these fronts, prepare to be offended. If you're a Sarah Palin fan you're going to be annoyed. I don't see any way around that.Watch it with all this in mind for a laugh, not to analyze, and you'll probably enjoy it."
5,This movie is a scream!,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. This movie is really, really funny! And I am someone who actually likes Sarah Palin, who gets made fun of fairly mercilessly. The film is camp and silly at times, but with some compelling (if deliberately stereotypical) characters and very nice performances by all of the actors. I think it actually has a worthwhile message, too. So I recommend it highly and without reservation."
5,Tells it like it is,"Simply love this film!! It reminded me of The Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but 5 times better.I got to say this too that some of the cast ( all absolutely wonderful and gorgeous ) have other Hollywood look-a-likes - the beautiful Julia Dietze as Renate Ricther = Julie Benz -- Stephanie Paul who plays the U.S. president = mature Amy Acker -- and Gotz Otto as Klaus Adler = Finnish Rally driver Marcus Gronholm.Very well made story and plot, the costumes quite masterful and the most of CGI designed rocketships I think are very convincingly believable because there is a big possibility some of them can actually be built in the future.Spoiler alert.. looks like Mars is the next target. I do hope if they make a sequel it would still be the same guys and most of the main casts'.."
4,A good show,"This was an unexpected pleasure. The acting was solid, the story line had great humor mixed with very good special effects. Almost believable. Look forward for the sequel!"
1,I was not able to view this film. I do not wish to be billed for a film I could not view at all. Very disapointed with service.,I hope I am not going to be billed for this film. I was not able to connect to the video stream. It is the first disapointing experience with your video streaming service.
2,"Great concept, poor execution","The idea of this movie is very intriguing, and there are some scenes that feel very original, but overall it just does not deliver.... unless you think of it as a comedy... then it makes watching this movie palpable."
1,"Dance, you Nazis, dance!","This is no ordinary schlock entertainment. The movie is actually very well made, smart and very, very funny. Sort of Dr. Strangelove meets Airplane by way of Mel Brooks, only the Nazis don't technically dance. Five stars for political satire, nods to film buffs, internet Hitler-riffing fanboi references, CGI and overall general ballsiness of the seriously wacked out entire credit list of individuals who will never work in this town again. One star to try to keep me from going to hell."
1,Don't get sucked into marketing hype,Do not buy this movie or waste your time with it. Truly terrible and I want my money back... don't get fooled by a clever campaign of high end marketing. It's a terrible and not funny film.. ugh.. terrible on all levels.. funny concept but the movie is so awful.. did I say AWFUL... my god what were these idiots thinking.. You can't even watch it for fun like Birdemic... oh well. .buyer beware.
1,You won't miss anything,"When playing this suck-fest play it at fast forward You won't miss anything. Not funny , bad in every way ."
2,"Pretty Absurd, Occasionally Hilarious","This movie had it's moments. A unfortunately small number of them though. Those moments were pretty hilarious, but a lot of the time it was just plain stupid. This movie had been hyped up so much that I had pretty high expectations, and it didn't deliver. The acting was ok out of most of the characters. Sarah Palin was over the top, but that was completely on purpose. The storyline wandered around from interesting, to confusing, to stupid over the course of 90 minutes. Go get this at redbox, it won't cost you as much."
3,okay movie review,"story had promise but they blew it big time, the f/x is the best part of this movie, what a waste of a plot"
3,Iron Sky- Space Nazi's!,"It was a silly movie, that certainly met any expectation of it - actually pretty good effects for such a small budget.Certainly good on the carnage, story line, could have used some more T & A.All in all worth $20."
2,A good 15 year old movie.,"This is not very good, hard towatch and brings back memories of WW2 and the shadow of the Klan. Herb Watkins"
3,It is what it is,"This is a B movie with a B plot and B acting. If you want a Nazi B movie, this might be for you."
4,Pretty entertaining off beat flick,"So what don't they use the Nazis for. Zombies, Vampires, you name it. Well, now they are on the moon. Why not. Obviously don't expect too much from this movie, however, if you're of the group that likes different stuff then it's a cool movie. We were suprised how good the special effects were. The plot not so much. All in all it was what it was. An entertaining movie with a blend of sci-fi and Nazis doing what they do best. You get the drift. RW."
5,"Loved it, maybe because I watched it unaware of all the hype","I'm not sure how people are so disappointed with this movie. It started out silly, and the absurdity got exponentially more intense as the movie went on.Yes, the acting may be off at times. The writing may be poor at times. The direction may be clunky at times. But none of this matters. If anything it enhances the ""expensive B movie"" feel.If I have one complaint about this movie, it's that it made me appreciate the potential awesomeness of a Sarah Palin presidency. That's scary."
4,Well done B movie,"Well done movie with top notch special effects and acting was well done. It's NOT a comedy and was never promoted as one, yes there some satire etc. The movie moves at a good pace and all in all well done. Could it have been better ... sure, many movies can be. For a B movie it's incredibly well done, it almost deserves a A."
3,cmt 3000 lbs winch,The second time i used this winch the engage and freespool gears have striped out I would like to no were i can get replacement parts from.
2,Title Misleading,"I was hoping for a detailed description of this incredible story of survival, such as has been written in ""The Land of the White Death"" or ""South"" by Shackleton (both excellent and richly detailed books). In author Robert's defense, it is quite apparent that there is little information available - what is could have been covered in a magazine article. While the book is interesting in its own right, my criticism lies in that the Title is misleading - it is more about his reseach on this subject than the actual historical record."
1,Short story,"If you read the ""Editorial Review"" for this book, you've read the story. The rest of this 288 page book is about how the author researched the story.If you want a good research story, get this book. If you want (like me) a Jack London/Shackleton story, look elsewhere."
1,An absolute waste.,"Only about 1/4 of this book is about the Russians shipwrecked for 6 years. The rest is about the story of researching the Russians. Roberts has nothing but vitriol for authors who have come before him. Roberts' way of detailing his research is so painstakingly boring that you'll think you're reading an accounting textbook. If Roberts sent a FAX to someone seeking the translation of a map, he'll not only tell you about the FAX but how fast he received a reply. Adventure has here been turned into how words have been translated into different languages and lost their original meaning. Of the dozens of Arctic and Antarctic survival books available this is among the worst."
1,Needed an editor,"I really enjoyed many aspects of ""Four Against the Arctic"", the story of the four stranded Russians, how the author followed up every lead to learn more about the original story (which many reviewers did not like) and the way the author tied in many other survival stories. A good book as far as content goes. But what I did not like about it was the jumbled and highly ornamented writing style. Not content to use a simple adjective when an obscure one will do, Mr. Roberts seems to write with a thesaurus at his side. There's no indication that the publisher assigned an editor to the project. That was mistake. ""Four Against the Arctic"" would have been a far better book if it had been edited. Although it was a relief to finish it, I still value ""Four Against the Arctic"" for the content. Glad I only paid two bucks for a used copy - thank-you Amazon."
2,Ego Trip,"While the parts about the Russian sailors are interesting, the book rapidly degrades into the author's ego trip as the book becomes more about what a clever researcher he is and less about the sailors. What a shame."
2,I read it anyway,"I'm an incurable fan of anything about the Artic or Antartic. Maybe because of my Norwegian roots. I devour this stuff, so David Robert's self-interest couldn't stop me. Nevertheless I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. There wasn't a whole lot in these 304 pages about the four Russian sailor/survivers. Robert's research at Cambridge got pretty slow, but when he finally arrived on Svalbard's shores, his own adventure, it was better. What troubled me was his continuous disdain of previous writers and even his disdain for his fellow adventurers on Svalbard. I think I learned a bit about Polar Bears though. How awesome that people can survive in these extreme environments. I'd like to try it some day."
2,Should be Titled: Find the Hidden Story,"This narrative is an excellent account of how people can survive in the face of a challange. Unfortunately, the author details the actual writing of the tale much more effectively than dramatizing the task of wintering the arctic. The actual story, (which is hard to find in the book), and the photography would have made a very interesting cover story of a National Geographic. What is ultimately presented turns out to be a mediocre story of how the auther did toil to research the information in his book. But that was not about what I had wanted to read."
1,Four Against the Arctic,"I kept reading, and reading, in anticipation of learning the story of 4 Russian sailors shipwrecked on an arctic island for 6 years, because that's why I bought the book. It wasn't until near the end that I realized that this book was really about the author and his 3 cronies hanging out in a cabin on an arctic island for two weeks, drinking fine French wine. From this book I also learned that the author reads French, is a Harvard grad, has a very large vocabulary, and a pathology regarding polar bears. None of this sheds light on the topic given in the title, thus a disappointment."
2,Very disappointing,I received this book as a Christmas present from my sister who knows that I love reading about polar adventures. DO NOT buy this book if you are wanting another exciting read along the lines of the Endurance or Karluk. DO buy this book if you like to read about what doctoral students do to earn extra money while working on their dissertations. (I'll save you the money and tell you here -- they do tedious research looking through the internet and databases and libraries for people who have the money and who then use their hard work to write boring books.)
1,It Goes Nowhere,"I kept going with this book because I felt it just had to get better at some point-but it doesn't. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a story about research, not about the four men who survived the shipwreck. I was hoping the polar bears would get the whole boring lot of them, but no luck with that, either."
2,Not enough information for a book,"This is an amazing story. However, most of the book is about writing the book. I don't care who he spoke to and where he read things. He should just tell the story. However, there isn't enough material for a book. Quite a disappointment."
5,Best Toaster Oven,"Very good product. Much better than our 10-year-old toastmaster.Good for toast and small items for baking.For Krups, suggest top that isn't flat so your not tempted to put anything on it as the top gets very hot."
4,This is the best toaster oven on the market today.,"This is truly a great product. With the digital timer there is no guessing about time and temperature. The 1600 watt quartz heating system is beyond any small oven that I have used. I don't even have to preheat. It reaches the set temperature within a minute. The convection feature is also very nice by reducing your cooking time on many products.I was disappointed with the size. If they had made it 2 inches longer it would have been large enough for a 9 x 13 baking dish, the most common size.There is one more issue that was disappointing. The baking pan is covered with a non-stick coating that scratches even from the food. It needs to be improved upon."
2,Not So Good,"I have always had small toaster and or convections overs, to save money and don't always need the power of my new JenAir Kitchen I just had installed (LOVE IT). When I only cook for myself, I use the small oven (Krups). For the price this oven is a BIG BIG MAJOR flop, it gets hot all over when cooking, you can burn yourself, the door does not operate correctly, jams, when cooking the sides and top of the door and frame turn brown from cooking, instead of venting. This is what other write ups also say, I should have learned from their mistakes.My recommendation is that I would PASS on this Krups, especially for the price, where is the craftmanship, attention to details and quality of the product, it does not exist.This is the most expensive Convection and or toaster oven I have ever bought and would strongly recommend that you look at cheaper models with same features, and based on write ups like this one choose any maker but this one.Good Luck if you chose this turkey."
3,Great! but BAD door hinge :-(,"Great convection oven, great toaster oven, makes great toast. BROKEN HINGE means door won't stay all the way shut anymore. Big BUMMER! Check the web for this problem and find creative solutions (magnets, bungee cords) just don't start a fire with an overheated bungee cord."
2,"""Toast"" button has started failing.","The ""Toast"" button has started failing when it's pushed. It takes many anxious moments of ""please start"". For the price, I thought this would have lasted longer than 2 years. I haven't given up, yet, but may be buying a Black and Decker with turn knob controls which is rated highly. The push buttons of remotes and toaster ovens seem to be a costly problem to consumers but beneficial to manufacturers."
2,Krups FBC512 6 Slice Convection Digital Toaster Oven,"We purchased it new in Jan. 2007 - it worked great until today, Nov. 15, 2009. I don't know what happened to it... we paid $182 for it from Amazon (Fontana Di Luce Corp.). It should last longer for that kind of money. I don't know if it is worth fixing it..."
5,The BEST Toaster Oven ever!!!!,We have had a few toaster oven in the past from Black & Decker to EuroPro to Kenmore. This is by far the best one that we have ever had. It actually toasts bread on 'both' sides without having to flip it in the middle of toasting. Our last toaster oven (EuroPro) used to take from 8 to 10 minutes to toast bread. The toast came out toasted uneven and dry as a Tums heartburn tablet. It comes out of this over evenly toasted and still moist in the middle in less than half the time. It also has a seperate bagel setting which works equally well. The oven portion works equally flawlessly. Highly recommended and worth the extra price over other toaster ovens!
5,Toaster Oven,"I really like this product. The toasting time, to me is not a problem. It does bagels better then anything I've ever used. The convection oven is great for smaller sized items. I would reccomend it to anyone needing something simular."
3,beautifully done except the recording engineering,"Ivan Fischer is a very skilled conductor. Mahler 2, like his Mahler 4 & 6, is exceptionally well done, except for the quite annoying recording quality, where some bits can barely be heard, while the dramatic moments will blast away at ear-walloping volume."
3,Bought it for class...,"This was for my english class. I hate english classes. I'm just not an essay person. Anyways, I did have to read this book, and I found it pretty interesting. The stories and poems were very good. I gave it 3 stars because I just don't like english class...."
1,ripoff,"...shuffles mostly public domain works in and out of editions for your english class. find out what your instructor wants, then check the web."
1,lacking,I purchased this book as a home schooling book. i was very disapointed in the amount of information given on each animal.
4,planer blades,"Hey, its a planer blade. The planer is the the important item. I plane a lot of hard woods, including teak (very, very tough on blades due to the silica content) and these blades seem to last reasoanbly well."
2,Not What I expected!!!,"This book is not what I expected. Zane is one of my best authors especially with erotica, and I was looking forward to reading her story, but she unfortunately disappointed me. I like when the characters find love that is all good and fine but can the sex be a little more detailed??? I am here in Iceland and a tad bit frustrated and I was waiting on this book for 2 weeks and I finally get it and it is not what I wanted to read. The only author that comes close to what I was looking for is Shonda Cheekes and even she did not reveal as much as I had hoped. If you are looking for pure down and dirty erotica you are not going to get it in this book..."
4,Good read!!!!!,"I'm not sure what the expectations where for other people who read this book, but I was pleased with what I read.""Duplicity"" - was a fun story to read. I thought I had it figured out, and then got caught off guard. I don't want to give anything away, but I think this is one story that will be enjoyed in the book.""Lessons Learned"" a nice story.""The Adventures of the Bold and Bourgeois"" this story was a fun read. It ended rather abrubtly, but it was still nice.""Delusions"" - this story was GREAT!!!! It's the kind of story that would keep you away from internet dating.""Your Message Has Been Sent"" - was the only story I did not like in the book. It just did not grab me or keep my interest.All in all the book was not bad."
1,COMPLETE MESS UP,I ordered this book as a gift for christmas and the person I got it for hated it. The first chapter was repeated twice and then it skipped about 50 pages! But it was to late for me to return it by the time they told me. I will never order from them again!
1,Terrible Erotica,This book left me very cold. With a writer like Zane at the helm I thought I was in for a sweaty ride. Her contribution to this collection was lack luster to say the least. She could have done so much more with the story line. My imagination ran wild but the pages of the book were empty. I wouldn't watse my money. Very sad.
4,Loved It,"Once again, don't pay such close attention to the reviews. It is all a matter of personal opinion. I really enjoyed both of Zane's stories. I just love everything that she writes. Her style, her description words, and sexual scenes. Zane is just awesome! She hasn't written anything I haven't enjoyed. The twin story was wild. I also enjoyed Delusions. It was comical to me. Another author I believe is a star writer is Shonda Cheeks. I truly enjoyed it. It is more like a love story. I am waiting to read her book Another Man's Wife. The other stories were just o.k. to me. But Bravo Zane and Shonda!!"
2,If you're expecting.......,"Out of curiosity, I decided to check this book out. Each story is what I would describe as being sweet and sappy. If you are expecting detailed love scenes, then this is not the book for you. It was surprising to see Zane describe sex as, ""Doing the do"" when she has never been one to hold back her tongue or should I say pen, on the matter of sex. So, this book was an ok read. I am happy that I did not purchase it, it was a library lend."
5,Enjoyable,I enjoyed these stories by all of these authors. But as we have come to know anything with Zane's name is worth your money. Some people will disagree but I have yet to read anything that has Zane's name on it to be nonsense. Zane IS worth your dollars.
3,I love Zane,"I can read Zane all day... however, I am more of a fan of her novels and not short stories... after a while they tend to get predictable"
1,Buy an eight ball instead,"One of the worse tool I ever acquired.Even in new construction where you know where the studs are it is hard to get consistant results with this tool.Same when measuring distances. Hold the tool at the fix location, take several time the measurment and you will get different results each time sometimes over a foot apart.Stay away."
4,"Well-written, but troubling","The author does an excellent job of researching and detailing the exhausting process of trying to save condemned prisoners' lives. But it is troubling to me that he fails to address the question: why do the anti-death penalty proponents spend so much effort trying to subvert what the public resoundingly demands -- execution of its heinous criminals. Perhaps I am being harsh (I can see both sides of the debate), but I wanted to know what causes people to spend long hours defending murderers, when their time could perhaps be spent with helping prevent the causes of the crimes."
5,Trust These Tales,"""The Best of Pif Magazine Off-Line"" offers a refreshing assortment of new stories and new voices. A standout among them is Mimi Carmen's ""Love Birds"". Ms. Carmen's tale of an aging mother and conflicted daughter resonates with idiosyncratic vision and gritty passion. The bird imagery is breathtaking. I also very much enjoyed ""23 Johnson Avenue, 1985"" by Diann Blakely. If writers were race horses, and I had money, I'd bet my wad on these two."
1,This is NOT the original Un Dia Bonito!,"This album is fantastic, and a joy for anyone who likes great music. However, this is NOT the version of Un Dia Bonito that was originally released! This does not contain the long piano solo introduction, but jumps right in where the horns start. It's great stuff, but it's not what I was looking for (I think it was originally on Coco records)."
4,Schubert's 4th,"This was not a work that I was attracted to, but this performance gives it special meaning, with its lively pace and clean production."
4,cultivate an intellectual flexibility,"The metaphor is rather appropriate. Janesick rises above the specifics of any given experiment in the social sciences. Instead she uses a dance metaphor to map onto common features of most experiments. At times this can perhaps seem strained. But the originality is to be commended. If nothing else, this helps retain the reader's attention, which is always to the good.The qualitative aspect is reflected in the lack of numerical formulas. Instead, you are driven to focus on teasing out a high level understanding from data. In this process, she suggests that you invoke an intuition about the subject. Of course, you have to develop this intuition. This comes from experience and a use of creativity. Plus, keep an eye out for serendipity. Otherwise known as the good luck of stumbling across a fruitful line of inquiry. The book stresses that you cultivate an intellectual flexibility suggested by the dance metaphor."
5,Very Informative,This book has really helped me in preparation for my upcoming dissertation. Using journal writing as a data collection tool was not something I knew before reading this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is starting or learning about writing qualitative research ( dissertation).
5,Great deal.,"Amazing songs, amazing band, great sound quality, and unsurpassed looks. How else can you display music?"
3,Described in 1 word: OK,"What can I say about this cd other than it's just OK. I've been a fan of Man-O-War for easily over 10 yrs so, I've heard just about everything they put out! It's definitly not The Triumph of Steel! Out of the 8 songs they have on this cd, I like 3 of them! The others just didn't do it for me. Thor (The Powerhead), the Oath, and Guyana (Cult of the dammed) were the only songs I enjoyed. The others just seemed like songs they threw together to fill the rest of the album."
5,A Great Recording of Dufay's Mass Plus,"Dufay was the music master of the early Renaissance, and this disc contains his mass setting of the greatest hit of the later middle ages and Renaissance, ""L'homme arme"", plus recordings of the song itself as well as chants and motets utilizing the tune as their basis, worked in among the mass setting pieces. However, lest potential buyers think they are getting some kind of new agey, fluffy music here, this recording works very hard to be authentic, and the performance is more powerful than serene, more earthy than spacey, and majestic in a very medieval way. Summerly and company get these works very right."
2,Product description is inaccurate...,"Nice bag, but I bought the silver/black version and the waist straps ARE NOT removable. This is quite an annoyance since the waist strap is basically useless-it does not affect your load bearing and is barely functional. An earlier review said that the waist straps are 'velcroed' in place. I must have the early version because my waist straps are sewn in place harder than a Yosemite tick. I would not recommend this pack."
3,"A very quick read and good primer, but out-of-date","This 130 page book is a very quick read, taking at most a few hours. It provides a great overview of how to run for local office, but not much detail about any particular aspect. It's very light so does provide a wide overview of the things you'll need to consider when running for office, but doesn't go sufficiently deep into any topic to be used without a more comprehensive text. Given that the book doesn't seem to have been updated since its initial first run in 1983, you're going to be much better off with a more up-to-date and more detailed text such as ""How To Win A Local Election: A Complete Step-by-Step Guide"" by Lawrence Grey."
2,Not enough power...,"A friend of mine bought this kit after I gushed about my Hitachi 14.4v system. I loved the chuck, the weight distribution and the fast charger. His 9.6 seemed too heavy, and while the charge held out for a good while, it simply wasn't up to running a masonry bit or driving deep wood screws. He felt like he had bought a weak screwdriver and an expensive flashlight. I just felt bad for recommending Hitachi drills in general. Usually their engineering is such that they don't offer a weak tool. Don't buy this except for fairly light duty. The 14.4 is as good a drill as is out there however, and I have used the 24v Bosch and can still say that."
5,great drill,"i spent a long time looking for the best cordless drill money can buy, and this is it! Features that mattered to me most (in no particular order) included bit holders on the drill, hand bit tightener, battery charging speed, price, drilling speed and stop time. Compared to other 9.6v+ drills this was the best at the best price. Survey included DeWalt, Makita, P&C, Riobi, Sears."
4,A Great Value !,"What a good value! This drill with 2 batteries, case, etc. is only $10 more than just one replacement battery for my older Dewalt 9.6v drill/driver! WOW! Why should I buy just one Dewalt battery for $69.95 when I can buy this whole kit for $10 more! Duh! Maybe I'll have more to say after I get this Hitachi and use it!An avid woodworker and homeowner. Dave."
2,NO LONGER AVAILABLE,"TRIED TO ORDER BUT WOUND UP AS A NO LONGER AVAAILABLE SO I CAN NOT FAIRLY REVIEW ITEM AS I DID NOT GET ONE, BUT DID GET A BETTER ONE AND LOVE IT , SAME BRAND."
4,Good Product!,This is my first order and I have heard good things about it and i am giving it a try.
5,"Excellent product, great price.","My sinuses are my weak point, and I usually battle colds and coughs several times during the winter. Started taking these a few months ago...and I haven't been sick once, even with an 18 month-old daughter in daycare! These capsules are high potency and easy to swallow, which I prefer to the chewable variety. Take two with breakfast and you're good to go! I'll definitely buy these again!"
3,Okay,"I took these while pregnant to strengthen my placenta. It is supposed to be a great additional vitamin to the many that I had to take. My only set back was that it was a horse pill and was very hard to get down. Upon doing more research on vitamins, it's common knowledge that vitamins never sync with your body as well as WHOLE FOODS. I stuck to buying oranges instead :)"
3,can be missed,The compostitions are pleasant enough and the playing is lively. I would agree with Mr. Hite that the reverb is excessive and would go farther and state that it spoils the whole thing.
1,Poor Quality,I've owned this toilet seat for one month today and it already has a place where the seam is coming apart about an inch in length. I would not recommend buying this product.
3,The best one available in a soft black seat so far,"Installed easy, very sturdy, doesn't shift, decent quality. My concern was when you sat on it you could hear and feel it deflating. It didn't make it any more uncomfortable, I just wondered if in time the pressure on the seams of the vinyl would end up giving way and tearing. And in time (about 6 months) it did. While the previous one I purchased lasted quite awhile, the shifting when sitting on it drove me nuts. This one did not do that but the seams did eventually tear and continue to spread and it had to be replaced. It is probably a seat better left for a toilet that doesn't get a lot of usage as it will be able to last a lot longer. I have since gone with a completely plastic seat."
2,Unbelievably unprofessional,"I can not believe, based on how much I needed to spend on this book, that many of the definitions cited in the chapters are from wikipedia. Wikipedia! I can't name a single professor who would accept that on a paper, but somehow, that's perfectly acceptable in the textbook publishing world. And some of the sources aren't even cited at all! And don't get me started on the perspective bias that is in there. One incident of a man who murdered five people was insinuated to be due to a miscommunication/bad persuasion issue, but when I found information outside of the book on the incident, there was no such causation mentioned...and the author had the death count off.Bottom-line is, although there is certainly useful information in here, but the book is constructed rather poorly, and based upon that alone, it's incredibly hard to trust the text. Certainly not worth the money spent."
2,Complete waste of time...,"The author is so very opinionated about politics that reading it is difficult. In addition the entire book is mostly on how to be a good listener, what to listen for, etc. Only the last few chapters have any reference to how to persuade people and it's very unremarkable information. Suggested my university drop this book from their line-up."
4,"Book was nice, but took longer than expected","I thought that I would have seen the book earlier than it had arrived since I bought the best shipping option. This text out of all my purchases was the last to arrive. Many had come the next day, this took almost a week. But, when it had arrived, it was in perfect condition."
2,not such good shape,"The book was listed as very good but was full of orange highlighter marks. I've bought many used books over the years but ones listed as ""very good"" typically are not so marked up. I will not buy from this person again."
3,EARLY work for this ensemble,"With later releases -- especially Codex Faenza and The Black Madonna -- Unicorn proves itself the no-holds-barred best instrumental ensemble in medieval music. This is their first mass-market CD, and their musicianship is...iffy. For instance, the later-incomparable Thomas Wimmer saws monotonously through Lamento di Tristano, and the later-virtuosic Marco Ambrosini is just plain jittery. Even Michael Posch, later the only medieval musician who approaches the level of the Indian masters, is at this stage unformed. Their performance style here is very mannered, opting often for ""weird"" or unusual effects and approaches."
4,Worthwhile reading.,"Flappers and Philosophers consists of 8 short stories authored by a youthful F. Scott Fitzgerald. Some of the stories are light hearted fun while others are rooted in tragedy. My personal favorite is ""The Cut-Glass Bowl"", a poignant account of the life of a married woman as she ages over a twenty year period.Each story serves as a showcase for Fitzgerald's prodigious talent. The plots are well structured and the prose is richly descriptive.All in all, an excellent collection of short stories by a highly skilled author at the outset of a legendary career. Highly recommended."
4,Pretty good,"Not a bad set of stories. ""The Offshore Pirate"" was the best---its one of the sweetest stories I have ever read."
2,Mediocre,"Fitzgerald has established that he _can_ write, and well in his other works. This one, however, leaves more than a little to be desired. Cartoonish brassy debs and Horatio Alger-style golden boys with island paradises mark the basic theme. Futher, Fitzgerald can't seem to finish a paragraph without some reference to ""darkies"" or some more insulting epitaph. I mean - Twain's references were bearable, because we have the feeling that he's on the right side. But Fitzgerald's omniscient narrator (read: Fitzgerald) is pretty objectionable in his characterizations. And then he makes the cardinal sin of being decidedly unclever with the story. Even Maugham is better."
3,Numerous typos that detract from meaning,"I understand that this Kindle book is free and that it was transcribed from physical books by a community of volunteers, but it really should be revised, for there are a great deal of data entry errors that detract from the meaning of the writing."
5,A good sampling of Fitzgerald,"This collection of short stories takes a candid look at America in the early 20th century. There isn't a stinker in the lot, but I think ""Bernice Bobs Her Hair"" is my favorite. Fitzgerald has a way of making his readers connect with unlikeable characters that seems almost magical."
4,Sacred Mushroom - I was there,"I saw Sacred Mushroom in concert. What is even more amazing is they played in concert in Cincinnati as the lead-off band for the Cream. The concert hall was a local church in Hyde Park, that was turned into a youth center to keep us kids off the street. It only held a couple of thousand people, so it went bankrupt right after the concert. We all stood just feet away from the Cream and of course the Sacred Mushroom performing live. Their song ""I'm not like everybody else"" should have made it much bigger than it did back then. Good news though - there's a new IBM commercial featuring it today. Brought back old memories."
1,Why Not Utilize The Original Manuals,"I am thinking that this training material would be a simple approach as to "" how to do"" . Maybe something in the line of the ""Dummy Series"". Instead, this publication is just a re-hash of the original manuals with out the detail break-down instructions I need. For example, show me in detail how to create a song fragments and then create multiple songs fragment and chain them together to create a final song. I needed step-by-step detail not provided in this product. I could not recommend this product."
1,These astronauts do not fly,Astronaut is yet another attempt by this lame new wave band to milk the cash cow.these lousy bums made this horrible album out of pure G-R-E-E-D.This is one of the lousiest albums of this century along with scissor sisters debut album.It is high time these aging bozos retire and call it a day.DONT EVEN CONTEMPLATE IN BUYING THIS LOUSY ALBUM.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.get THE WALL from PINK FLOYD INSTEAD.this album deserves and gets no stars from me.
5,Duran Duran Astronaut Excellent,"Yes, I've been a fan since 1984. Fan status or not, this album is excellent.Too bad MTV and the american-mob-radio-networks are profiting so much from music promoting sex, violence, & crime; otherwise, they might play real music like this Duran Duran CD."
4,Nice Comeback,Duran Duran provides yet again another great album of sure fire songs that are up to par with their stellar history.
4,LeBon sounds better now in many ways...,"While the album is very solid, the songwriting is not quite as good as the Wedding Album, but its close enough for my taste.I think notorious is still my favorite, but I will tell you that Lebon sounds cleaner now than ever. I think he used to overcook it a little bit, attacking notes a little harshly, but now I'm guessing he knows how to stay within himself better as age will make you do that (plus there is some studio magic going on). Don't get me wrong, he sounds fanstatic, especially at his age.Duran Duran is a very unique band in that they started with extreme pop status the overshadowed some fantastic songwriting, and when the pop status left them, all that we left was the talent. That's why the Wedding Album was so great. This one might grow on me even more, but for now its a solid 4 stars.I hope they pump out a few more while Simon still have the pipes.have the occassional squeakly yelp (a la Reflex close."
4,A Valuable Album,"WOW, not bad I thought the first time I listened to this album, Then after listening to Astronaut a few more times, I thought that there were some REALLY good songs on it. I've owned this CD since Late October '04 and it is in my cd player at least once a week. Then I listen over, and over. If given the choice of buying this album again, I would definitly. There is so much energy in the album, they sound great.I never realized how much talent this band really has both in songwriting, and performance. If you are trying to decide wether ore not to purchase this Album,I can tell you that I am not a big Duran fan. Before Astronaught I had The Wedding Album you know the one with Ordinary World and my Come undone. It was good, but thats it, so being as I'm a new fan to their music, and i really think it's great, long time fans should love it."
2,whats all the fuss?,"i love duran dont get me wrong, the live performance last year of what happens tommorrow was excellent, but they chump out on this new cd. which is not good at all, its weak, and andys guitar is hidden. I actually liked pop trash and the last 2 better.. reach up for the sunrise is not a good song.. if you want a better reunion cd gt the new tears for fears. it is excellent cause theres no skip overs . Also, 7 and the ragged tiger is wayyyy better than this.. good luck..also the lyrics are whipped up and some of the songs end epruptly."
1,Pure Crap,"OK. I'm a Duran fan from the 80's. I've come to expect eloquently crafted songs full of hooks, varying tempos, and songs that actually mean something. This CD has none of it. Reach for the Sun comes close, but the rest is pure filler that sounds like it could have been written in an afternoon.Nothing to see here, move along."
2,NOT the Fab Five!,"For people who refer to Duran Duran as the Fab Five, I would say, there is nothing Fab about them - they don't compare to the Beatles (the Fab Four) or any other great band.I have listened to this album a number of times and only the first 4 songs are decent. The rest are not very good at all.The song, Taste The Summer is, in particular, quite bad and annoying.No song on this album can compare to songs like Hungry Like The Wolf and Ordinary World, which were good songs.This band just doesn't strike me as having much originality (at the present time), nor does it seem like they would be much of a band to watch at a concert.Just my opinion, others may really like them."
5,I Love This Album,"I love this record. I did not expect to like it as much as I do. A bit on the pop side but I like it, can't help it."
3,Double D comes back Strong,I really enjoyed listening to this album. It was like Simon LeBon's voice never changed and I was back in the 80's listening to them again with my friends. Good Music in all.
2,just not that great,"I really tried to love this album, but honestly it just isn't that great. Most of the 5 star reviews are from people who would give ANY new DD a 5 star review, no matter what it sounded like.There are maybe four good songs, the singles, love you more and finest hour. the rest would've been cut from any previous DD album.The true believers will rave on, but deep in their hearts they know better. Be honest, if Rio is 5 stars, this is only two or three.And why oh why did they cut ""Beautiful Colours""? It was the best new song on the tour before the album came out."
1,"Band is the best, Astronaut music is most worthy",So why the 1-star rating? Because the CD is copy-protected so badly that it will not play on almost any computer CD drive and those are all my stereo is hooked up to. It also has problems on certain car players although it did work on mine. This is completely unacceptable.
4,They are back!!!,"Well, Duran Duran is finally back again! Thats right. All five members are back together again and this is their first album toghether in a long time. The songs are a mix of their original style and that of the 90's. Roger Taylor is back drumming in the style that we loved so much in the 80's. Simons voice sounds as good as it ever did! Amazing. Yes, studio technology and recording today can do amazing things for vocalists but the voice is still a voice and Simon Le Bon's sounds as young and fresh as in the 80's. Wow! The complex and melodic bass lines of John Taylor are so great to hear again. The simple yet always melodic guitar leads of Andy Taylor bring us back again to vintage Duran. And as always Nick Rhodes works his magic on the electronic side of things adding fresh new techno type riffs to the whole mix. This CD has something for everyone and easily crossovers into a variety of genres. Great stuff! Four stars."
1,One of the worst I have ever read...,"All I can say is thank god i got this book at a used book sale and got it for only 50 cents. I thought that the story in the beginning was incredibly slow, and not at all suspensful. In fact, I kept losing interest in the book and stopped reading it shortly after I began. Finally i decided to finally finish it off so i never had to see it again. This book truly left me bored, and thinking ""so what?' about it. I think I am going to stick to familiar names like Pike and Stine and not try to venture off for a while unless something really looks good. Oh well, guess I will send it to another used book store for some other person to find."
3,Bit insertion not easy,"I had a great deal of difficulty getting the bit in and out of the router. The instructions indicated that the 1/4"" bit be inserted into the collet, and then into the shaft. Wrong. Perhaps my collet was 1 or 2 micrometers off, but I could not insert the collet until I figured out to remove the shaft sleeve and insert the collet from underneath, which was no where in the instructions. Then when I tried to remove the bit, the darn thing would not come out. I eventually had to use a flat head screwdriver and a mallot to pound the darn thing. This is my only fault with the product. I would think that changing the bit should be an easier task since it is done so often. Perhaps my shaft or collet is defective. Regardless, such an item should be tested at the manufacturer to ensure proper fitting."
1,Makita 3 1/4 plunge router,"This was a big dissapointment, usually makita puts on a good show. But not this time. The tollerance in the plunge mechanism is terrible. It allows the router bit over 1/16 of movement from side to side while plunging the router. I thought there was something wrong with the router I was sent so I asked amazon to replace it, they did and the second one was worse than the first. Then I asked the Makita rep, his response was,"" It must be a knock-off."" When I asked him to come take a look he declined and advised me to return it. One of the worst tools I have ever bought..."
3,Good Router but...,"There are a few points I'd like to bring up on the Makita router:First, I like this Makita router but I have to agree with other reviewers that the bits are extremely hard to get out of the router. The routing capabilities are just fine but I dread at the end of the day trying to come up with new & inventive ways of getting the router bit out of the router.Second, the router is heavy and a bit of a load to wield.Third, it seems that virtually any router accessory is built for, or by, Porter Cable. If you are looking to ""accessorize"" your router then you may want to simply consider PC.I am a fairly novice woodworker so take my observations for what their worth. Haven't used any other plunge routers. No ""deal breakers"" in here but just things to consider.Happy routing!"
2,"Worked Great, for two minutes!","I realize that every manufacturer builds one or two lemons, so I can't be too harsh on Makita. For the most part, they make great tools. I didn't get a chance to test the router's cutting ability, however I can say that it is very heavy and I would not use it for too much handheld routing. I still think I would recommend this router for a table mount to someone else based on Makita's history."
4,Bit Removal,"Fine router. Hefty, with lots of power. The turret/adjustment system could be a little more refined.I was having problems with bit removal, too, until I realized the trick (maybe I even read the instructions.) Loosen the nut, turn it by hand in the same direction a few more times, and you will feel the collet nut tighten again. Loosen it with the wrench a second time and the bit releases. No problem."
3,Not for Horror fans.,"Something makes me want to cradle this film in my arms and nurture it into a bigger budget film, in English, with a touch of gore, and genius Mathematical tests. It has all the potential of being a really amazing, intelligent film. But then I can't help but look upon it for it's innocent simplicity. This film is more for avid foreign film fans and not for the horror community. I instantly knew the answer to one of the 'tests' because it's in the childrens film 'Labyrinth', but you just can't help but love it for it's sheer humbleness."
2,This is in SPANISH,The information is a patent lie this is a spanish language film not english. I seldom enjoy foreign language films as when I am tired I may fall asleep instead of reading the subtitles to keep up with the film. I feel like this information is misrepresented when it calls the film to be in english.
5,Pleased,Book arrived within given time frame and matched the description given. There was minimal highlighting & underlining throughout the book.
2,Eh...,"Bought this book for a class, hated the class, never used the book. It was very dry and boring. If its not required I wouldn't buy it."
3,A Turning Point,"I realize that this series is about the Brannon family. However Vicksburg was the turning point of the Civil War. On July 4, 1863 Grant takes Vicksburg and on the same day Lee is forced to withdraw from Gettysburg. I truly think that a little more time could have been given to the end of the Siege of Vicksburg. Cory's concern of not making it in time for the wedding is not more important. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
3,the dissolution of a nation,"The Serbian Dragan Velikic, who once declared that ""art is not an objective but a process"", strives to give the reader an active role in this original novel in which no element seems to ever lose a feeling of perpetual motion. The conception of the writer as archivist of reality is manifested in the richness of detail -the variety of characters, the minutiae of objects, the focus on the city as a compendium of fragmented reality, the dissolution of ordered time sequences...- in a crafted metaphor of the chaos resulting from the fragmentation of the old Yugoslavia.Recommended for readers interested in a nostalgic account of the recently disappeared nation of the Balkans."
3,Just Okay,I have done a lot of different Workout DVDs several are Denise Austin. This one I found was just okay. I was disappointed you could not combine the workouts. So you could do level one of abs and then had to go back to the main menu to do legs or arms. There are some weird camera angles that I found distracting.
3,What is going on?,I absolutely love Denise Austin but I have to say that this DVD has awkward moments that no one has mentioned. She seems to be touching one of the women that is working out with her way too much and it seems so inappropriate. It was actually hard to watch and made me not want to continue using this DVD. The woman actually looked uncomfortable to me and as if she's trying to make eye contact with someone behind the cameras while it's happening. I just don't know what is happening in this DVD. This was in the abs section level 2. I didn't watch the rest.
5,Great product,This video is great for someone trying to get into regular exercise. I like that I can make the workout as long or short as I need to. Would strongly recommend for beginner and intermediate workouts.
4,Great workout,Wanted an all-around body toner/shaper and this is it. A beginner will find most of the exercises do-ableThanks Denise.
5,Really like Denise's video's,"Let me start out by saying I have to be one of the most uncoordinated women in the world so this video is great for me. She really makes the work outs easy to follow. I wouldn't say this is hardcore it is a struggle at times, but just about anyone could do this and feel like they got a descent workout."
4,Not a Densie Fan but...,"I enjoy this one.Denise has her faults as with Leslie Sansone. However like Leslie, Denise Austin make working out easy for those who are not fit."
5,Easy and effective,"This is actually my second time purchasing these vidoes- I bought them a few years ago on VHS, and I like them so much that I decided to buy them on DVD. You really will see results in 6 weeks if you do the exercises 3 times a week. Each level is very brief (Level 1 is just about 5 minutes; Level 3 is about 20 minutes), so it is easy to get started with minimal commitment. Then as you get used to doing the exercises, you don't even notice the increase in time. These are a great supplement to a regular workout to target areas that need a little extra work. I've been a Denise Austin fan for years and I highly recommend this program."
5,Denise Austin Get fit fast.,LOVE IT !! If you want to lose weight this is the one. I have lost 30 lbs in 1 month by following the eating program and excerciseing every morning. I workout about 15 min everyday and I am getting stronger and more fit !!!
4,Music,I loved being able to hear the album songs before I purchased it. There is'nt anything that I would have wanted to know before I purchased this album.
3,Get past the Plastic!,"I'm an avid Firm believer so was excited when I got this one as I loved the Lower Body Sculpt. This is a decent workout but you really have to get past the plastic face of the instructor. At 30 minutes, it's great for those of us on a tight schedule and does work your upper body hard. This has to be one of my least favorite Firm workouts though because of the robotic look of Janet. (Even my 9 year old daughter noticed it!)"
4,Great upper body workout!,"My arms feel like boiled spaghetti after doing this workout! I have lots of Firm videos and this is the only one with this instructor that I own. She is different than all the others and there's something about her that I'm just not sure about. With that said, I can get past my feelings about her to do the workout and it isn't easy. It is definitely a good upper body workout."
2,needs additional euipment,"I didn`t realize that it required other equipment than hand weights, so Ive only done the workout once. It may take a few times to do it to keep up with the moves, and the required equipment would help, but it`s one more thing to take up space (not a lot though)."
2,Far from the best...,"It's the worst TheFIRM workout I ever tried. It requires a sculpting stick, 2 different Fanny Lifters, and at least four sets of dumbbells. Who has all of these at home? Every few minutes instructor spends time to move from one equipment to the other.There are many good home workouts that achieve same or better results without all this nonsense."
3,Somewhat Pleased,"The Firm Upper body sculpt DVD did not meet all of my expectations.Not enough info was offered to let you know that you need to purchase additional equipment (the stabilizer bar and fanny lifter) in order to do the workout. The free weight exersises where good, but not enough reps, too many routine changes and not very enthusiastic instructors. Geared more for women. Could not get my hubby to work out to it with me. I have heard that The Firm Series from the 1980's is better than the current. But I'am not going to experiment. I'll continue to work out to my Billy Blanks videos."
4,Ow! But love it! OW!,"Upper body in need of an uplift? This is the one baby! Be prepared to work it out and tough it out. Your muscles will be screaming and you might be too, but you'll be glad when you're done that you did something that is going to be worth it. Not for wimps this!"
5,Works like a champ,Bought this to extend thread on two steel posts. Thread was the right size for the nuts and pretty consistent. Can't comment yet on the long term durability. Will update if anything changes.
5,Great Bag,"This bag has So much storage! I love that there are so many compartments to put smaller items, but still a large open area for bulkier items. The strap is long enough to sling across your body for long walks to and from a jobsite. My only issue (and it's more a matter of my height than tht bag construction) is that when I walk down a ladderwell on a ship the bag hits the steps behind me and sometimes hangs me up."
2,Cards are not the same,"I own 2 of these cards for my two Garmin PDA/GPS. The first card had a fast read speed and that led me to buy another one; but however, the second card turned out with a much slower read speed. I am not buying another product from this company."
3,Not fast enough for the TX1,"I bought this as a memory card for the Canon TX1. It's not fast enough fast enough for HD recording at the best quality. That said, if you are just doing photos and other lite recording it will probably work fine."
1,Not at all as it's described,Don't waste your money!!! This item does not work as good as it describes. Good luck returning this item! It's a rip-off!
1,Bad,"I'm Sorry. The voice iS all crackly and it barely changed my voice. Then, it Stopped functioning altogether after about a week."
5,Chambers Etymological English Dictionary,I wrote the publisher several years ago pleading for them to reprint this gem. It's the best little dictionary I've ever used.
2,Not worth the money,"I have purchased 2 of these poles in the past six months. The first one, I thought I damaged myself by not being really careful with it. The pole would close on itself when fully extended making it impossible to open again. The hand tightner would not hold the pole open, had to use duct tape. Bought another pole figuring I would be extra cautious with it and to ensure I did everything correct. I had the same issue within 2 weeks. The pole slid back on itself when fully extended causing the pole not to extend properly also the hand tightining lock does not function well at all. This is the second and last pole I buy. The only reason it got 2 stars, was when it did work correctly, it was a lifesaver for cleaning the second story. I pressure wash homes and need a commericial grade pole vice a once and done pole."
3,24' Wand,"Good product, gets heavy when clearing gutters on the second floor, but better than using a ladder."
3,It worked...and that's about it.,"When this arrived, it had evidently been stepped on or had boxes stacked on top of it because it was like pulling teeth to get it extended and I haven't got it fully extended yet, but enough to use it. Once I did extend it (by using a pair of vise grips attached to one end and braced between a fence while I pulled with all 300 pounds of me on the other, a lot of grunting, cursing, etc.) I discovered that the inner aluminum pole had been crushed (the outer fiberglass pole obviously bounced back after IT was crushed). Since I hate the hassle of sending things back (and I couldn't get it UN-extended), I decided to hook it up and give it a test run with the gutter cleaning attachment. Believe me, it took every bit of strength I've got on that second story gutter, but it worked. 6'1"" tall, 300 pounds, weight-lifting 3 days a week. If you're 5'8"" and 150 lbs. forget it."
3,Be prepared!,"I bought this to avoid cleaning gutters with a ladder. 2nd floor. At first I used a very low PSI tip to try to clean. It didn't do anything. So I swapped out for a 30 degree tip. When I pressed the handle the tip shot the wand backwards and up. (Had the U shaped gutter attachment on). If I were a little lighter( 6' and 195 lbs) i might have gotten knocked over. SO be sure to test it out at ground level to assess flex and thrust. It worked well. It takes some technique, put nozzle in gutter and pull down and press trigger."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"I purchased this extension wand to clean a two story building, when you extend the wand to it's full length it is like having a fishing pole with no control whatsoever it is extremely heavy. My strongest employee was unable to clean the building let alone holding it for more than 5 minutes. This company is very difficult to work with, make sure you are going to like this because it is not easy to return and they want to charge a re-stocking fee along with the shipping of it both ways ($45) even though the product is misleading. Buyer beware!!!!"
2,Hard to use fully extended,I bought this to allow for easy cleaning of high up areas so I did not have to climb a ladder to use my pressure washer (which is not recommended). I am not a small guy at all and this wand with full pressure is so hard to use when it is extended that it is almost impossible to control. It flexes so much when extended and it is hard to extend and retract that I have had to use vise grips to loosen or tighten the extension length. The unit actually failed and was spraying water out of a cracked fitting but was easily fixed thanks to my plumber father. I never use this fully extended anymore and try to avoid using it when I can help it.
1,Masterpieces Poorly Recorded,"This is some of Gloria Lynne's absolutely best work very poorly recorded on the Collectable label out of Pennsylvania. BEWARE! If it were not for Amazon's policy for not accepting return CD's opened, I would have delivered it to them by hand. This is a tragedy. The company even recorded some of these great songs off a scratchy LP, with no filtering whatsoever. Really low rent approach..."
1,Apprehensive,"This is not a review, per se.I'm apprehensive about buying a product when the producer doesn't show serious interest. ""Collectable?"" Really? If the producer can't spell ""collectible"" properly, it doesn't give me confidence about the care they put into the product.I came to Amazon today specifically to look for a Gloria Lynne disc to buy. It's not going to be one that this outfit puts out, that's for sure."
4,A Beautiful Collection of Russian Liturgical Music,"Russian liturgical music from the monasteries is a combination of a number of different styles. Since the Church id from the orthodox tradition, the music is influenced partly by Greek liturgical music. It also has a bit of a western Gregorian flow to it, though this is not as strong as other influences. It also has a bit of Russian folk music flair to it. Musically it is interesting, but it also has a spiritual quality to it. Perhaps because it has survived against tremendous odds during the Soviet years, it has strength to it as well.This recording by the Novospassky Monastery Choir contains liturgical music primarily for Easter but contains other prayers and psalms as well. The CD has liner notes but no translation for the music, but for the price, this is not a complaint. The choir is strong and is able to convey both the majesty and beauty of the music.Once again, Naxos has provided a unique quality musical experience and a budget price."
1,A disappointment,"I must say that I'm quite disappointed with this CD. The title is misleading in the extreme. There is very little of what I would consider and actual chant on the whole CD, and the rest is operatic western-style singing which is not what I would expect from an Orthodox monastic choir. If the title had been correctly discriptive I would not have purchased this item, and as the matter stands, I'll give it away to any of my Orthodox friends who might want it. I really must remember to check ALL the sound clips before I buy."
5,Great Little Book,"At first this book looks like your basic decorating book but what I found was a way to freshen up a space with items you already have or that could be picked up inexpensively. The room/area settings are a little minimalistic but I'm trying to head that way so for me the ""less is more"" works. However, what I found interesting was that I could easily imagine my furniture, pictures, etc. used in a design similar to the set up in their picture. I read decorating books because I feel like I don't have that natural instinct, but this book seemed to use room/area ideas that worked with what I already have or would like to have. If you are a decorating pro already you don't need this book. If you are like me and need a little direction, this book is pretty good."
5,Unputdownable,"Wow! What a powerful book. What emotional exposure. The writing has such compelling cadence and wonderful unhackneyed metaphors.The reconciliation in the final chapters between son and father is written with remarkable, nuanced grace.Anyone living with an Alcohol problem will find resonant insights here as the author describes his struggles."
4,memories,"If... you are a babyboomer If... you are a runner.. and if your life was complicated by a fathers dominance and isolation then this book is for you!ANDREW SHEEHAN tells the story of his famous father the late GEORGE SHEEHAN a doctor who's passion for running consumed not only a country but himself ,hes family and everyone around him.THE authors eloquent discription of growing up in a large irish-catholic family,his long battle with alcohol,the abandment of a father.The nostalgia was at times so overwhelming it brought me to tears...because my life so closely mirrored that of andy sheehanthe church the rejection the Kennedys growing up in the 60's the BEATLES the war the drugs.this book will take you back to a place and time in our lives that made our generation so special"
3,tigger is wonderful,"If it takes Tigger to get a new song out of Long John Baldry, then so be it; his croaky ode to Winnie the Pooh is a sparkling jazz number and a wonderful finale for this 14 song soundtrack of lovable, huggable, bouncy, wouncy singalong kiddie songs. Rather than using Tigger as an excuse to pinch out a shedload of new Elton John/Tim Rice stinkers that parents will love and kids will hate, the album collaborators (which include Michael Becker, Dick and Bob Sherman, Kenny Loggins and Mike Abbott) have created a traditional collection of outrageous singalongs which mix elements of jazz, blues and showtunes in a colourful storybook of sound as loony, absurd and appealing as its rubber-tailed star. Few children's movie soundtracks ever aim this high anymore."
3,Nice piece of history,"This is just a tape so not much re-playability i think. The acting is not that great(but it's not as bad as it could be), and the fact there's no response from your shooting at the screen makes it more of a target practice run through then much of a game to me.Still worth buying if your a videogame colletor(like me), and isn't half bad for something to kill time."
2,Not Very Practical or Helpful,"With little information from the sole review, I bought this book. Actually, it is a collection of what appear to be thesis papers on law firm marketing. Mostly, it tries to come to grips with lawyers actually marketing and whether lawyers should advertise. For an attorney looking for information about how to effectively market and advertise, the book is quite useless. Many flow charts and abstractions make the book quite a headache to read at times. I'm glad I got this one used."
3,"Lots of information, poor presentation",There is lots of useful information in the book. No doubt the author has a very good understanding of the subject. But the prsention is not orderly and makes this book harder to understand. The book does not have any examples at all. It is difficult to teach rules of astrology without examples. I will not recomend this book for a beginer. I felt 'Light on Life' a better book for the beginer.
2,went way over my head,"the books were filled with information but everything went way over my head and i consider myself a step up from a beginner in terms of astrology. so i was really disappointed that the essential elements, e.g., how to interpret a chart weren't explained more clearly."
5,Protects the liver from prednisone,My vet put my cat on this supplement about 6 years ago. She thought it might do well in protecting my cats liver from the effects of prednisone. My cat is now 11 and has been on various dosages of prednisone since age 3. These have ranged from 5 mg/day to 15mg/day. Her liver is perfect and my vet is gratified. My cat and I are overjoyed. This is a great product!
4,This new cd is better than all the B.S. on the radio now,This album goes back to the old days of gangsta rap when ni**as didn't give a f**k
1,Refreshing Change,"At last, after all the filth and angry shouting being peddled as ""music"" these days by the pop-culture industry, these wholesome young boys have given us something special: a charming little album full of delightful songs about chaste love and the innocent pleasures of childhood. This is not surprising, though, when you realize that not only did children's-rights-advocate Michael Jackson produce this album, he has also acted as mentor to these sweet young boys and is known to have spent a great deal of quality time with them. He has trained them well, it seems, because so far they have bravely refused all requests by the nosy media to divulge intimate details of their days and nights at Neverland Ranch. It's so refreshing to see such loyalty and devotion to one's elders these days!"
2,hiking book collector,"I spend all winter planning my hikes for the summer. I own and have used most of the titles for Yosemite. Hiking Yosemite National Park has most of the most popular trails but two other books do a better job: 100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park and Lonely Planet Hiking in the Sierra Nevada.My main complaint is the incomplete descriptions, too short and too vague. If you get off the trail you'll run the risk of getting lost because there are no ""big picture"" maps. A topo is absolutely essential if you want to understand your location."
4,Very useful book,"This book is very easy to navigate through & the author gives great topgraphical maps for each hike section. I've been using this book to plan my trip this year & it will let you know what to expect on the terrain mile by mile. Each trail has a difficulty rating, appx. travel time, seasons best to hike, GPS compatible, and some VERY basic info on contacting the park.I would recommend buying a complete map to Yosemite which will help to plan your entire trip. I've recently purchased National Geographic Destination Map & it will give you all the additional info you need. It gives much more info on campgrounds, how/where to purchase permits for the backcountry, driving distances within the park & other accomodations."
5,Great overview,this is a Great overview&Collection for the Money.Karen Carpenter was something else vocally.Richard Carpenter was on point as a Musician&Arranger as well.Karen was a Solid Musican who understood simplicity but added a warmth&Feel Good vibe to it as well.I enjoy there work a good deal.Classic Material here.
5,Carpenters CD,The Carpenters CD came OK and I have already heard many of the hits of 30 years ago. Thanks.
1,musak at its best,"I was very disappointed with the recording. It is so syrupy, saccharine, so overproduced, it is only suitable for background, easy listening of a dentist office. Not like the pop music Karen sang during her peak in the 1970s that was simple and melodic."
1,old boring junk that nobody cares about anymore! Lady Gaga is a legend.,"howdy fellow amazonians... lol. last weekend i got drunk off two wine coolers and a bottle of odouls and some of it spilled all over my carpet! so i was looking for someone to replace my carpet and found these bozos! false advertising if you ask me.LOL!anywho...i love female vocalists, some of my favorites include britney spears, lady gaga, jessica simpson, and beyonce... but lately ive noticed a trend in which people are listening to oldies junk and not whats HIP! these Carpenter folks have no place in the music industry!Where is the cool vocal sound effects? why doesnt the girl wear more revealing clothes? and how come they dont sing about smoking weed or pimpz n hoez??? the songs ""mr postman"" and 'superstar"" are horrible and dont compare to the legendary ""bad romance"" by the ultra talented lady gaga!for good music make sure to avoid the carpenters...."
3,"good set, but too much re-mixing","first, let me say that I bought this collection a couple of days ago and it is a great deal. the only thing I don't like is richard's tampering with the old tracks by adding new instrumental tracks to old carpenters standards. I have an old interview of richard saying that his influences were the beatles, the beach boys and bach, and you can definitely hear them in his work. all i ask is leave the old well-known tunes alone and finish the unfinished ones."
3,It's all about Karen.............,"In my opinion, The allure of the Carpenters was due to argueably the most beautiful voice in entertainment....ever. The sheer angelic qualities of her singing are likely never to be heard again. Certainly, the pathetic screeching we hear from the so-called Divas of today couldn't hold a candle to her vocally. I think it is sad that Richard has nothing left to do than create remixes for the rest of his life, so take what you can from her performances on this one as a glimpse of perfection. Their music was ahead of it's time although few realized it. This album is worth buying if you are new to their music. If you grew up with their music, the remixes do grate a bit and so do the linked tracks."
5,It was an impulse buy...,I heard a Carpenters song on the radio one day and decided to look for a CD since I loved their music growing up. It's amazing how much beautiful music they made in such a relatively short period of time. The mastering of this CD is great. The songs sound as fresh as they did back then.
2,tiniest book I've ever purchased!!,"When this book arrived after ordering it from Amazon (and being fooled by other reviews), my husband and I couldn't stop laughing--this is not an encyclopedia but a pocket sized dictionary (literally 2inches squared), with entries such as ""ants""--the descriptions of anything are way too short to be of any merit, and if you really need to look up the definition of ""ant"" you are going to need a lot more help in your garden than this book can supply!!The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is the shock-value I had when I received it--and a good laugh is always worth something.In place you might consider Nancy Bubel's ""Seed Starting Handbook""--lots of useful, easy-to-follow, and fairly detailed information on gardening."
5,Outstanding Book on the Sept 11th Disaster,"This book is a must read. Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down. The author has captured the essence of what really happened at ground zero. The stories are very intense. She has interviewed survivors, police, rescue workers, fireman and Lisa Beamer."
1,"OK, if you like fuzz everywhere","After spending so much time detailing my Touareg and waxing, I put this fluffball on to shine it up more. Fuzz fuzz everywhere, it was horrible. Tossed it in the garbage unfortunately."
2,This item was a christmas gift.,I gave this item as a gift so I never heard anything about it after. I received it in brand new condition.
2,Disappointing,"Park's movies are known for their ultraviolence, but the blood spilling and skin in here didn't enhance the largely boring movie. I didn't understand the motivations of the characters and the plot twists aren't set up well. Some stunning visuals, especially that sequence across the rooftops. To me, the worst Park Chan-wook movie to date."
2,Not Worth Buying,"Was intrigued to watch this movie because I like the director for the movies he has visioned in the past, (Three Extremes, Oldboy) which I really enjoyed. But this 'piece of work' so to say is very slow and strange. Not very entertaining and dialog is just cretinous. It doesn't really portray the same exact attributes that your average vampire movie would have and maybe that's why I didn't find it to be amusing. If you feel the need to see this, just rent it. Don't Purchase, you'll be dissatisfied."
1,Thirst,"I bought this movie expecting an erotic asian thriller. Instead it was a PG rated movie. It moves real slow, and starts to drag along. The main vampire never does anything violent or erotic to women, instead he just eats rats and other small animals. I give it one star I wished I never watched it."
1,IT WONT PLAY ON MY PS#,"All of my blu rays have played on my ps3 just fine! But then when I buy thirst it doesnt play. It shows a picture and thats it of the map of earth and an a under america that has been x""d out. !?!?!?!??!?!?!??!"
4,Thirst...,"Thirst is an intersting take on vampirism. The main vampire is a Catholic Priest, who originally participated in a study to help people, he ended up being affected and transformed into a creature who craved/needed human blood. His transistion proved interesting, as he gave way to his passions (in more than one manner)! Well acted. Well staged. Well done! There are scenes of a nude/erotic nature, but nothing major that could offend, after all, the movie is rate ""R"".If you want to see a vampire movie with a Korean flavor, then I can recommend ""Thrist"".I rate ""Thirst"": 4 stars!"
4,A very different take on the vampires genre,Seeing more and more imagination being thrown into this genre of film.Cud have been edited to make it a little crisper.
4,A DEVOUT PRIEST BECOMES A VAMPIRE AND MUST LIVE WITH HIS LUST FOR BLOOD,"A beloved ""MAN OF THE CLOTH"" is contaminated by an blood transfusion and discovers he is sick and has developed a THIRST for drinking blood. Learning to live with this BLOOD LUST creates a moral challenge and leads him into a life of GUILT and PERVERSION. There is substantial VIOLENCE, NUDITY and SEX. I'm sure this movie is not for everyone, but I thought it was very well done and I liked it. I would recommend it, but sparingly. It is a Korean production and, so, is not in English. Must read subtitles (unless you speak Korean)."
2,Uhh... what kind of dub leaves the Japanese VA's voice in?!,"I've watched a lot of dubbed animes, but this has gotta be the worst ever. Although it's arguable in which is the worst, watch it yourself to see. Watching the first few minutes I thought ""ok, this isn't too terribly bad,"" but then it took a dive for the worst: Viz left the original Japanese voice actor's singing in for Mitsuki! The sad thing is, the American voice and Japanese voice don't even sound alike so I was like ""she's singing?!."" I have seen a lot of things. What you're paying for in this DVD is basically the English dub. The English version takes so many liberties on the characters' pasts that it's not even funny. I could almost swear that Viz ripped the script straight from a FanSub and changed a few lines to Americanize it."
1,OMG,This was horrible to watch because the english dub sucked so bad. The manga was so much better. I wouldn't waste my money on buying the english version when the Japanese version is so much better.
1,This is so horrible!,"This is the most horrible dub ever! Since when did they find AMATAURS to do their voices?! Seriously, Eichi deserves a better voice than that! And Takuto? I think my pet rock does better!"
5,Great resource for Japanese teachers!,This series is an excellent cultural component for a middle school Japanese language curriculum. The kids love the animae. It is best employed using Japanese audio with English subtitles.
4,Die Hard with a Vengence (Special Edition),"I have always enjoy Die Hard movies, and like the first 2 episodes, it's always pack with endless actions."
5,As i was goin to St. Ives I met a Man with Seven Wives,"The best movie of the series. Period. It has more action, more scenery, better characters, better acting. This is the ultimate edition. Samuel L. Jackson. Beautiful Performance as a somewhat racist store owner who becomes an unlikely partner after saving John McClane in the first ten minutes of the movie. From there it is non stop action. No meaningless stretches where they jsut talk and ramble about nothing. Simon is the villain who has caught some feelings over his brother's death. ( Nakatomi) and does an excellent job as the villain. The only gripe is that simon went out like a punk. I think they coudve ended it better but it still leaves you satisfied. YOU should definitely buy this. Also check out the first two because they are no slouch either."
2,Same old formula,"Same old formula. . .Yes, it's full of action and stunts, but once you have seen one, it's easy to get tired of:o Bruce Willis making faces and cursing in phony frustrationo blurred images to generate phony excitemento lights that shine directly into the camerao Willis armed with a pistol and a handful of cartridges confronting a whole shipful of heavily armed terrorists"
3,u thought die hard was good this was even better,bruce willis with great great actor Samuel L. Jackson made this one of da best action movies of da decade it was action packed from da beginning to the ending and what made this movie even better is that it took place in NYC one of my favorite places in the world in the top three moving on this time there were terrorist but it was da man take his brother place from part one he had a lot of bombs lock on to destroy several parts of nyc but what bruce and sam didn't no that half of there were phony da terrorist guy and his worker tried everything 2 get rid of tried to drown him n da tunnel but bruce escape and i enjoyed da scene when bruce willis flew like superman out of da tunnel 2 find sam keep call his name 2 c if bruce was ok them tried 2 blow up sam and bruce on da boat but they manage to escape from da boat as well i can talk about this movie all day long if i wish but i won't because i don't want to ruin it 4 those who have yet seen da movie JB
4,THIRD TIME'S A CHARM! EXCELLENT ENTRY IN THE SERIES!,"Well, He's at it again. This time Willis teams up with Samuel Jackson in this non stop thrilling entry in the Die Hard series. Tense with suspense to spare this is one crazy movie! It's Hollywood over the top at it's finest. The DVD transfer is very good and the 2 disc version in the ultimate box has some nice extras."
4,Good action / fair story,"Good action, but the story was lacking. And what was with the whole black/white thing? Totally unnecessary and out of place. A joke or two would have been acceptable but they ran it into the ground. Save the social issues for films like 'American History X'."
4,"""Great Die Hard Sequel!""","Bruce Willis, Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson starin this 1995 action sequel. Cop, John McClane and ashopkeeper face a terrorist bomber seeking revenge.This is a great sequel that I put right next to theoriginal and Jeremy is a great villain as usual. Thisspecial edition has good picture and sound plusneat extras. I highly recommend this."
3,Hard Not to Like,"DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE does not have the emotion and consistency of the first two movies. It doesn't happen on Christmas Eve like the other two. John Mclane's wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) isn't in it. Finally as in the first two films, the terrorism happens in the confines of one specific area (i.e. Die Hard: in a high rise building, Die Hard II: at an airport). This adventure is all over the map in New York City. However, it is one of those movies that grows better with repeated viewings, somehow works better on the small screen, and also helped by the chemistry of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. Jeremy Irons is decent as the villian and overall an above average action thriller."
3,The Worst From The Trilogy.,"The worst from the trilogy the secondary actors where the ones who destroyed this movie together with some parts of the story but the secondary actors the captain, the FBI agents, the secretary nobody knew how to act only Willis, Jackson and Irons all of the rest where a waste of money and damage to the film which already had many plot holes."
3,A roller coster of a thrill ride.,In this third instalment of this action trilogy.John would rather not rmember his past as he returns to NEW YORK only to find that when he does he's thwarted by a mad man Simon(Jeremy irons)and a bystander caught in the middle(Samuel L. Jackson Mclane must do exactly what Simon says or he will blow up the entire city.A high tech roller coster ride explosive action not much of a DVD but another popcorn movie avrage picture great sound take the ride a fun movie to end this incredible action saga.
2,die hard with a vengeance,"the dich stops in the middel and I;ll never buy from them again, its not worth the problem to send it back."
1,first dissapointment for Amazon,The fact that the item never shipped would be the main problem. Amazon has always been able to deliver packages on time! I've had orders arrive to the house succesfully before this order and since then ordered a few more items and all delivered on time. I'm still awaiting a response from the Amazon team or a refund for the missing product.Otherwise it's a brilliant film!
2,This movie ''died hard''!,"This movie(Die Hard With a Vengeance)did not surprise me with the ending of the trilogy Die Hard.Some scenes were poor,and olso there was not a good plot and music behind it.So rent this movie don't buy it.And never listen to those other creeps saying that it was marvelous because it wasn't.And it won't be worth the money to rent it either."
3,Fun movie marred by poor quality stream/video,The movie itself is perfectly ridiculous fun; you get what you expect. But the stream of the video was quite poor (we have high-speed AT&T U-verse with all bars a-blazing) and the stream stopped dead in its tracks twice.
4,I liked it,"Bruce Willis is witty and serious, saving the day. All of the Die Hard movies are entertaining, but hopefully new one coming out is much better."

4,Did you notice something...,"After McClane and Zeus leave the van that has the FBI's in it. Walter steps over to talk to a group of men, one which is the founder of Wendy's, Dave Tomas, and some of his empoyee's that work at Wendy's old fashion hambers. lol Anyway a good movie, but this newest edition which just came out this year, 'Live free or die hard' is a huge step in being a total different Die Hard experience."
5,SUMMER IN THE CITY,IN YOUR FACE ACTION!!!! It hits you with a bang. Fast paced action is done superbly by Mr. McTiernan. New York heat waves REALLY DO make you go crazy! Well shot and amazing action!! THE BEST!!!
2,A Sign of the Times,"The most flattering appraisal one could give of ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" is ""moronic"". What else is one to remark of a movie in which people are manifestly killed for the pleasure of the audience watching it? It is a sign of our profoundly debased and witless times that the same rating of 3.5 stars should have been given by a pundit to this brutal, vainglorious, and puerile film as he had elsewhere deigned to give to a very different film, ""Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet"" (1940; director William Dieterle; starring Edward G. Robinson, in a magnificent performance), which concerns the historical career of a famous medical scientist and his brilliant and heroic accomplishments, which quite literally saved countless millions of human lives."
3,South American pot-pourri,"For those who don't already have these titles, this is a good representative selection of the subject matter. Mr. Henry plays capably and with good tone (although a certain blandness informs the first eight tracks, the album springing suddenly to life after the ninth -- perhaps recorded on a different day?)The arrangement of Misionera is by Jorge Morel, although this is uncredited -- I wonder if he's getting his royalties? The final Venezuelan Waltz (Lauro) is N 2, not N 3 as listed.Total time is 56'29"".DISCLOSUREI received a free copy of this item for review."
4,If you need to know about planking and fastening,"I don't know why the other reviewer bought this book. This is a collection of articles by different authors from Woodenboat magazine regarding ... planking and fastening. It's not really a fun book like some boat design books but more of a manual on how to complete a boat. If you're building a tradional(non-plywood)wood boat, you'll find at least one and probably several articles in here that will more than pay for the book in time and money saved. I gave it 4 stars because it could be a bit better organized."
2,Bring Your Marine Glossary For This Book,"On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being written for the novice and 10 being written for the professional, I definitely have to rate this book a 10 for it's technical difficulty. The author apparently feels it's more important to impress the reader with how much he knows and all the fancy words that a ""real"" professional would use rather than write an easy to follow how-to book that most novices can follow. This is not to say that this is the only marine how-to author who is guilty of this. However, this guy pushes it way over board (no pun intended). After spending 15 minutes with this book, I had to pack it up and send it back to whence it came. Even the pictures were difficult to follow. Sorry, Pete. Maybe I'll come across one of your other books that I can understand a little more easily. But this one had me baffled from the word go."
5,It made me laugh and then it made me cry,For a book about a guy in a prison this is hilarious. Reminds me very much of Joseph Heller's Catch-22.
3,Interesting and strangely entertaining prisoner memoir,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first half of this book. The reason I only rate it a three out of five is because the last half of the book was so incredibly boring and self-serving, as Lerner tries to justify the crime for which he was imprisoned.What is most important in this book is the essence of the prison experience that Lerner writes about. Any informed reader can sort out the BS that Lerner weaves into the retelling of his prison experience. I actually found depth and meaning into his contrasting his prior life as a cubicle worker with the prison experience.Some parts of the book had me laughing out loud. I also thought about the meaning and message of this book for a long time after I'd finished reading it. The book is worth reading and skipping over the self-serving part of the book when Lerner goes into the details of the murder that sent him to prison."
3,Slight Letdown,"The most interesting parts about the book was descriptions of daily life but it gets rapidly boring (as real prison probably does too). If you're seen the discovery channel about prisons, you probably have seen most of this before.He launches into the prison life from the beginning without telling you what happened to get him there, just when that gets interesting about 3/4 of the way done, he goes into telling us about his crime and what happened. At that point I wasn't interested in that part (it's actually kind of boring, if a murder can be that way), I found myself skipping pages to get back to the prison to find out what happened to him ..."
2,Don't Let a Murderer Profit,"The author killed a man (""self defense' with a belt and a plastic bag. Uh-huh) and now profits from this book while the victim's family wakes up every day without him. By all means, read this book at the library, buy it used, or borrow it from a friend, but do NOT purchase it new."
5,Don't start it at night because you won't fall asleep,"It makes the TV show OZ seem trivial and ridiculous when you know what really goes on in a state prison! The fact that anybody could survive and actually turn their lives around and hopefully prosper in the future should give hope to all incarcerated individuals. Because if a nobody can survive and actually come out a better person and hopefully not re-enter the revolving door syndrome, then this should give hope to almost any individual."
4,You Got Nothing Coming: Notes from a Prison Fish,This was recommended to me as an oddly uplifting and inspiring book regardless of the prison topic. My friend was right. This is one of those little gems that give you more than you expect on so many levels.
5,review of a prison fish,Excellent book very real gives an excellent account of prison life from the point of view of an inmate. an excellent read not a waste of time highly recomended.
5,Excellent - a must read!,"Wow, I could not put this book down. What an excellent read. Learner is a wonderful writer -- I hope he continues on his writing path. I didn't know if I would like a book about prison life -- this is exceptional."
5,"One of my favorite books, ever!","Superb read. Killing someone and being sent to prison has got to be one of the worst nightmares for anyone. Jimmy Learner describes his experience so well, with such great prose and honesty, I was simply blown away. I had to call in sick from work so I could finish this book. So powerful and touching. The inside jacket compares this novel to the HBO show OZ, but trust me, this book is so much better it is beyond comparison. I learned so much from O.G. and thank him for writing such a compelling novel. Clear off a prime space on you book shelf for this one!"
3,For weening puppies.,"This product is a cheaper alternative to Esbilac, but has only about half the nutrition. I use this for my older puppies to blend the ""mush"" while they transition from nursing to solid food. I do not feel it is good enough for newborns. They can live on it, but they don't gain the weight they need."
5,Best Delirious? to date...,"And that's saying a lot. The band has put out some amazing records but this one takes the cake. Just the tracks ""Mountains High"", ""With You"", ""Inside Outside"", and ""Majesty"" make it a must for any fan of beautiful heart-wrenching music. I swear, when I listen to this album, I'm in a musical eutopia."
5,Love at first listen,"There are only 6 CDs I have ever fallen in love with on the first listening. Def Leppard-Hysteria, Aerosmith-Pump, Simply Red-Stars, Petra-This Means War, MorningStar-Worship, and then this, Delirious-World Service.Yeah, that's sure a strange mix and you can almost see when I gave my life over to Jesus :)I hated Mezzamorphis when I first heard it, now I LOVE it, I disliked Glo when I first heard it, now I LOVE it. So if you don't like this CD, let it grow on you. I haven't played in about a week as I moved house, and I got withdrawal symptoms from it. Now it's playing, ahh....Intense worship! If you're like me, someone who just LOVES to worship, you'll love this CD. Even before you learn the lyrics, you'll just feel so drawn into worship as their heart is so open and revealed in the music."
5,The best Christian Album of all time.,"""World Service"" is easily the greatest Christian Album of all time. ""Inside Outside"" and ""Rain Down"" are my favorite songs of all time. Enough said."
5,World Service is Awesome!,Delirious continues to grow musically. They are truly blessed by the Lord. I think this is their best album yet.
5,Unique Christian sound affects me like no other...,"I have had this CD playing continuously for two weeks now, and I must say it is fantastic. The musical composition, depth of emotion, and a beat that echoes the unique sounds of U2, but with very deep, quality vocals, makes it tops. This is also a band that sounds as good live as it does in the studio. If you have never purchased music from Delirious, this would be a good CD to start with!"
1,too weak,6 month old German Shorthaired Pointer broke this toy within 5 min.I don't recommend this toy for big breeder even though puppy.
3,Not crazy about it,My dog liked it in the beginning but now has lost interest only after a week. In retrospect this was waste of my money...
4,Good Toy!,"Great toy for my puppy. My only wish is that all of the tabs were ""crinkly"", instead of 1/4 of them. Those are her favorite parts to chew."
5,My dog loves this toy,"Somehow my dog manages to shred every toy he gets . . . except this one. He loves the krinkly noises; it keeps him occupied. Although, he has tried to destroy it, the toy is still in tact."
3,Be Careful Tags Come Off Easily,My dog loved this toy. She's obsessed with tags so this was perfect for her. Some of the tags make crinkle sounds which she liked. The problem is the tags are pretty easy to get off. She's a Cavalier King Charles and on the small side - about 9lbs - and she had no problem ripping them off in a few minutes. Sizewise this toy is meant for a puppy or small dog.
2,Labradoodle has no interest in this toy,"I can't comment on the quality of this product, as my now 12 week old Labradoodle has absolutely no interest in this toy. Since she's been teething, and will pretty much bite on anything and everything, I thought this would be great for her. She nudged at it just once and never looked at it again."
2,Pup didn't find it interesting,"Bought this for a teething 8-week-old border collie puppy. She really likes things that make a ""crinkle"" noise, so I figured this would be fun for her. She played with it for about 30 seconds, put it down, and never looked at it again. And this is a puppy that will bite and chew ANYTHING she sees. I tried to play tug-of-war with her with this, and she was very disinterested with it.The ""crinkly"" noise is very slight & soft--definitely nothing loud enough to keep a high-energy dog like a border collie engaged.Might be fun for extremely young pups (maybe 3-5 weeks?), or very sensitive/easily-scared dogs, but if you have a pup that really likes gnawing on stuff and making a lot of noise, look elsewhere :)"
3,"Ehh, OK","My dog played with this for about a day. It doesn't squeak, it crinkles and is kind of bland and boring."
3,Made in China,"I haven't even tried this toy out yet with my puppy; it may be really great. But it's made in China. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it because I'm really trying hard to buy American. I just want to let others know also."
5,9 week Yorkiepoo LOVES THIS!,"We purchased this toy because we noticed our Yorkiepoo would chew on tags on blankets, pillows, and his pet bed. We saw this and noticed the little flaps were similar to tags and was advertised as a great toy for interacting with your puppy. This is definitely our puppy's favorite toy! It's great for playing fetch, and he loves running down the hall to pick it up and return it to us. He can do this for about an hour before he is worn out and needs a nap! Great interaction toy! We are really happy with this purchase! The crackling sound is a great addition, it really does get his attention!"
5,Good soft toy,"This is a good soft toy for my puppy, and it lasts a long time. My puppy is teething and can easily tear holes in some plush toys, so this is a soft toy that is also more durable."
2,Smaller than I thought,"This was a nice toy, but it is made for small pets. It was too small for my 73 lb dogs, but it stood up to their torture."
3,"Great Quality, but does not fly well.","I previously similar products from this manufacture and love the quality and material that was used so I thought I buy this one to throw further, but it does not fly very well. Still likes this brand and will continue buying their products."
5,Fun for fetch,"Initially my Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy (~13 weeks old), was very interested in this. She likes the crinkling noise and it keeps her fairly occupied. She plays fetch with it really well, until her attention wanders, as happens with puppies. Our fun game is for me to put it on her nose and she works to get it off. Super cute!"
2,Worthwhile; I am skeptical about the authors motivation,"The prose, the feeling, the humanity--all are to be relished in this book. I agree with those who have mentioned these qualities, and this is why I recommend this paperback. But as another reader stated, perhaps a bit too crudely, I really do question the authors COMPLETE motivation for writing this (paperback issued, in December, just in time for Christmas) book. I have no quarrel with a friend wanting to find out as much factual information as possible about the death of a childhood playmate and dear companion; just ease up a bit on the rather self-righteous I'm-so-sick-of-seeing-this-case-exploited-I'll-tell-it-with-love-this-is-the-ONLY-reason-I'm-writing-this- book attitude. There is nothing wrong in admitting you'd like to see some green profit. It is possible to be sincere and be a capitalist at the same time, and it's possible to admit so without standing on a soapbox."
1,IS THIS A JOKE?,"Hard to believe somebody came up with such a crackpot idea. Obviously jumping on a bandwagon (creating her own bandwagon is more like it!). A crock intended to discredit some appreciated professionals. Has no punch, no jazz, no heart. Just posturing and self applauding. Goodbye to this one!"
4,A Unique Perspective,"This is a deeply personal look at a much discussed and misunderstood crime, from someone who knew the deceased as a person, not a distorted image or a victim. The author's loyal friendship and sometimes painfully honest search for truth is a breath of fresh air in a media driven, often heartless, real-life mystery. The crisp writing style moves the reader along effortlessly and gives one a lot to think about!"
5,more human side shown,"Elizabeth Short is idealized in this version by a younger neighbor, although some physical rumors are clarified a bit. The biggest flaw in all of the books I've read is that apparently no one at the time of the murder did interviews with the multitudes of people she had lived with, off of and seen regularly. What about the letters she wrote and never mailed? At any rate I'm enjoying the book and believe the truth is a part of each author's viewpoint--I don't think anyone had a handle on her."
4,A Good Story about Beth Short,"If those who are interested in knowing more about Beth Short a.k.a Black Dahlia, then this is the book to read. Keep an open mind about it. This book gives me idea of what Beth Short is like so that I can understand the case of Black Dahlia. In this book, the author described her as good friend, a neighbor. Beth was known as kind, sweet person who would never into trouble. It is better to read from author who knew her from her childhood. I don't think that Orson Wells is the killer, but this book is excellent about Beth Short's profile. She was also know in L.A. as a kind, sweet person who don't drink nor smoke nor anything bad. I highly recommended for anyone who would like to know Beth Short, read it!"
3,Finally! A Respectful Account,"After watching the atrocity that was the film entitled ""The Black Dahlia"" starring Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson, I wanted to know what could be substantiated about who Elizabeth Short really was. This book more than met my needs.Pacios writes in painstaking detail the memories she has of her experiences with ""Bette"" and the memories of those in her community including Elizabeth Short's neighbors, friends, and family. When it came to actual facts about Elizabeth beyond Pacios' time with her, Pacios uses quotes from her numerous interviews with acquaintances, detectives, and from her extensive research to write the truth of who Elizabeth was - a remarkably attractive free spirit who lived a moral life and was deeply loved by those who knew her.If you want to know who Elizabeth Short was to those who knew her, this book is the way to go."
4,Good and sad read,"I was very impressed with this book. I'm a bit amazed that anyone could judge it as harshly as the people below. Are you sure you read the same book? You guys seem really angry. The info was well documented, so it's difficult to see where you're coming from."
5,Worth the Assembly,"This is worth the time it takes to assemble. You will need someone with smaller hands because the holes are tiny and in a small space. However, once put together, it looks and works great. Keeps ties from wrinkling and fits easily inside of a small closet door."
5,Perfect solution,"This thing is awesome. .. after experimenting with so many other ways to hang my ties, and being disappointed, I stumbled upon this simple yet effective product. It's easy to install, easy to organize, and my ties look great. They also never fall off onto the floor. Love it."
5,Tie Rack,"Perfect fit for our space, solid and steady. No more tie racks that go in circles, run out of batteries, or constantly become off-balance because they are mounted on a clothes bar. This lets my husband see his ties easily and keeps him organized!"
3,"Tie Rack, not belt rack","This would be a good rack for ties...However, it does not work for belts as indicated.The belts do not fit on the little plastic flaps.I had to go buy some hooks to place on the bar I mounted."
5,nice tie holder,"this is a nice tie holder,my husband had no trouble putting it up either,very nice looking.im glad i ordered it."
4,great space saver,i love this tie rack. i don't wear a tie everyday so i don't need to have them out front and center so i have this mounted in the back of my closet. it's great for keeping the ties from wrinkling and for seeing all the ties at once so you can select which tie you want.
5,I bought three!,"I bought three of these, but only really needed to hang two since there is a good amount of extra space on them. It almost looks like art on the wall of my bedroom."
5,The best concept I have seen,"This tie rack is well-made, and highly functional. Having the ties on the hangers makes it easy to keep ties in a rotation (pull a tie off the front, move it to the back). I pick out my husbands shirt/tie every morning and I just hang the tie on the hanger of his shirt. We have been using this for almost a year, and are still 100% happy with it. Highly recommend."
5,Product Review,"Nice product, with an easy, simple installation. It is nice that is comes with 30 tie hangers. Overall a great product."
4,Nice!,"Easy to install, holds plenty of ties. If you're pressed for space you can actualy fit 2 ties per holder, or simply add more holders beyond the 30 or so that come with this product."
4,Great item for any occasion!,Great item to have! Hangs up nicely and it doesn't take up much space. You can hang up to thirty-one ties!
4,WYSIWYG,Very simple. Sturdy. I like the removable plastic hangers - they hold the ties securely and flat against one another.
4,Simple design and works great,This is the third tie holder I own. The second one of this style. Holds more than 30 ties so I bought a set of replacement clips that I split between the two tie racks. Easy to install and worth the money.
5,Works Great!,"Very simple product, but exactly what I needed to organize my ties in a closet with limited space. Highly recommended!"
4,Love this tie rack!,"THe rack is good quality and a great idea. The only complaint is that it could come with more hangars... Also there doesn't appear to be any way to get more hangers...But, the price is good and the product is great!"
5,Simple Tie Holder - Simple is Best,"I've already ordered a second one if that is any indication of what I think of this little, simple, and low cost product. Don't bother looking at anything else - non-motorized, motorized, ""hanger-based"", etc. Just order this unit for yourself, friends, neighbors, relatives . . . no one will be unhappy. And, if you have really heavy ties left over from some prior century, you can replace the screws that came with the unit with longer ones that can go into your wall studs (assuming they are the normal 16 inches apart) since the smart people that designed the unit, spaced the attachments at the same distance. That's great engineering (must have gone to Georgia Tech)."
5,Excellent!!!,"Surely Seban works! Having oily skin, I always had problem with shiny makeup. After reading pros/cons of primers and oily skin on Amazon.com, I read someone recommending this and decided to give it a shot. WOW! It really helps to get rid of that shiny, oily look and with it breakups! I really missed it when I went to California and pimples started to appear all over my face. Now, I don't travel without it!!! Highly recommend it!!!"
2,Maddie should keep her day job,"I was looking forward to this film, if for no other reason than to see what kind of job Madonna did on her directorial debut. What a jumbled mess. At least she still has her music career. I did laugh out loud at a few jokes, and thought Vicky McClure was adorable. However, Eugene Hutz' accent was so thick in places that I had trouble understanding anything he said. As seems typical these days, it seems the film was trying to be more artsy than it actually is - or deserves to be."
1,Why Did I Bother?,"Madonna fans: Buy This Used And Cheap! (Kind of like the Material Girl herself)A friend popped it in and I was there anyway so we watched this horror show. A couple of funny lines doth not a classic make. How does one who cannot act her way out of a paper bag decide she can direct? Not much of a plot, one of those pictures that is supposed to have some deep message, but just left us dry at the end. In ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" she just played herself, so it was a pretty good movie. But as time goes by, her movies get worse and worse. Considering ""Swept Away,"" THAT is no easy achievement.For hardcore slobbering fans only. The curious or non-Madonna nuts can stay far away."
3,Music great; CD case damaged,"Excellent music (*****) and delivery speed (*****).Unfortunately, the CD case was badly damaged.This too is part of the overall purchase experience.It is annoying, but not worth the time & trouble to return."
3,irritated and confussed,"The product is as advertised well built and durable to the touch. My problem as stated by another are the instructions on how to set the sensor, the instructions or lack there of where confussing and non descriptive even my electrician was unable to get the sensor and timer to work. I even waited for nightfall and still can't get it to work! I tried accessing globs web site but there still building it so that's out. I'll play with it another night and if I can't get it to work I'll return them for something else! GREAT VALUE! POOR INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!"
4,Jann Arden's life.,"After viewing this DVD, I am now a bigger fan that I was before. If there is a fault, it is that I wish there had been at least one full length concert song performed. What a joy to have the opportunity to see into jan's life. What a great artist. Long live Jan's music."
5,"The ultimate in ""nerdy"" detail about the battle of Jutland","I gave the book five stars because it does a terrific job of achieving what it set out to do: describe the fighting in (unbelievable) detail. Of course this also means the book will be perceived as ""dry"" by most people and will appeal to a small audience. But if you're one of those rare people who wants to know the exact diameter of the hole punched into the second deck of the Barham by the shell that struck home at 5:21 PM, well, this is the book for you!"
3,Desperately needing photos or sketches,"A very interesting book, but difficult to wade through. The narrative is so detailed that one is soon lost. Had there been a series of photos documenting the damage, or even better sketches to describe the hits I feel that this book would have been superb."
5,hard working and easy removal,"It has a good design and is washable ,long lasting and it is easy removal and install. what can i say"
5,Good as it needs to be,"This product works like it should, what more can I say? It arrived, took it out of the package, put it on the polisher and it worked."
3,Mario was great! But he was no Opera Singer!,"Let me just say one thing thing. Lanza had a great voice. He could sing the same notes as Bjorling, Di Steffano, and Del Monaco. But he couldn't sing opera like them. His ""Amor ti vieta"", ""Come um bel di di maggio"" and ""Improvviso"" were fairly week and sounded like he was sight reading the pieces for the first time. His ""Nessun dorma!"" was good but it almost sounds like he sings this piece 1/2 step lower in key than what we hear today from the likes of Pavarotti and Carreras and Domingo. We all know that Lanza was a great singer of American Popular repertoire,( not quite like Sinatra and Bennett though!) But he certainly was no Opera singer. He had an Operetic voice. That was it. Maybe this is why he never ever performed in a staged Opera. If you're a Lanza fan through and through, buy this disc. If you are an Opera fan, don't!"
4,BMG Needs to hire Folks in the Know,"There are several cuts on this CD that Lnaza did in fact record much better at other times. I have all his records LPs, 78s and movies and I wish BMG would consult a Lanza fan,or me,for the cuts would make the perfect CD. I think its great that we have such a wonderful collection of recordings of Lanza and this one warts and all is still one of the best. The best Lanza set was the RCA LP 2 record set put out in the 70s with Lanza on the cover in M. Butterfly. Where oh where can it be??? Long live Mario Lanza!"
5,ORENDA,(JOANNE SHENANDOAH)I LIKE HER MUSIC SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE ANYTHING BY OR WITH HER YOU CAN'T GO WRONG I THINK HER AND SHARON BURCH AND MARY YOUNGBLOOD SHOULD MAKE A CD THAT WOULD BE YIKES..
1,HP DVD+R 8x is a very bad product,I bought 4 50-pack HP DVD+R 8x media spindles and used them to back up my computer data. Only 1 out of 5 disks worked with minor glitches. All 4 others failed miserably. Data corruption is the major problem with this product.
2,"Ok on PC, not very good with DVD recorder","I had been buying Memorex DVD+R media, but thought I'd try the HP because the 50 pack was priced 25% less than the Memorex brand, and HP is not exactly a no-name brand. I found that the HP media works ok on my PC's (HP) dvd burner ok, but I really wanted to use these on my dvd video recorder. I tried to record 4 movies off-the-air. 2 of them worked ok, the other 2 errored and resulted in a 'coaster'. At that point, I figured the media was not quite good enough for that device (it's a Cyberhome CH-DVR 1500).Based on this, and not wanting to waste any more media, I'm going back to Memorex brand for the video recorder. I think the extra few $ for that brand is money well spent and don't think I'll be buying anymore HP media."
5,Best example of the KISS method,"Like a couple of other posters, I'm not a huge fan of using biscuit joiners but on large glue-ups, mine still gets quite a bit of use, mostly for alignment.I have used another popular brand of biscuit joiner and find the Makita top notch. I like it because it's not overly complicated at all and the chips really fly as opposed to clogging up in the chute. The fence is substantial, easy to adjust / lock and it's very straight forward to use. I don't want to have to ""refresh my memory"" for its use on those few occasions when I need biscuits. If for some reason I needed another, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Makita for this tool."
5,Typical Makita Quality,"This is a very nice plate joiner, and the rack & pinion adjustment is very accurate. Another nice feature is the plunge mechanism, which is very smooth. A good buy and a good performer."
3,Works well but is a dying breed.,I will preface my review with a blanket statement. Every tool has its job. For crude joinery I think this is top notch. For fine woodworking I would never use this. Glues are so stong now days I would just soon glue and clamp it and not have the risk of the bisqit blooming through the wood. Again do your homework on technique before buying tools.
5,I just love biscuits!,"This plate joiner works great! It's movement is extremely smooth and the cuts are accurate. I've made many joints with this tool and it's a pleasure to use every time. The depth stop is easy to use and consistant, just dial to the correct biscuit size. I love how it holds on to the wood, no slipping, even on miters/bevels. It's very easy to use and you may find yourself using it for more than just biscuits."
3,Fence,"Simple to use, excellent power. Whats' with the fence. I am disappointed with this Biscuit Joiner. I bought a 14.4V cordless Makita and was so happy using it that I bougth the MBJ very dissapointed. The fence is a joke. Hope they improve on the fence."
5,Tuners,Excellent product. Makes restringing a whole lot easier. Produces better tone on any given instrument due to less wrapping around the post.
4,Not Quite Sure Yet,"The reason i bought these was for the higher tuning ratio than others I had looked at. However the locking Dial seems to be made from plastic. This worries me I know that the Sprezels seem built a little more beefy! I think I wish i would have bought the Sprezels. I know Grover Has an 18:1 ratio just like the PLanet Waves but never had the chance to check them out Physically. Good luck hope this helps, hope the plastic proves me wrong!"
4,"Humorous, entertaining, and informative","I bought this little book before a long road trip, and was pleasantly surprised to find it quite entertaining as well as informative.It covers topics ranging from the cat social ladder (actually, it's a circle..), to the reason why cats are attracted to cat-hating-people, to the mysteries of ""cat space!""All in all, a fun little read. I gave it to my friend as a host gift, and he enjoyed it as well.And I don't even like cats!"
3,wind deflectors,Doesn't look as good as I thought it would. I think it sticks out to far and is too bubbly. Also package shipped naked.
5,Very SOulful,Black Ivory Sounds Fantastic.Time is Love is the Jam.I Miss Real SInging Groups that could Blow your mind with their Talent.Pure Quality&Great Music To Go Along with it.This is what's Missing from Today's Music.You Hear these Brothers Sing&it Still Sounds as Tight as it did when it first came out.Very Essential For Folks that DIg Strong Vocal Groups.
4,Satisfied,"The lamp is beautiful. This item met my expectations and I have used it for several months without any difficulties. The fabric is a rather delicate, partially transparent, and brilliant bleached white Shoji/rice paper. The frame is stable and without defect. I recently purchased a similar make from an Asian store for about 10 dollars less, so I can't say it is the best price available, but it is quite pleasing and I don't regret the purchase."
3,AAA guide to California Fishing,"This book's look, feel, and set up reminds me of a AAA tour guide, which is good or bad depending on your needs."
4,fun novelty baby doll,"This is a fun baby doll with many options; no functions, speech/expression, drink/wet, eat/mess, all functions at once. Our girls have played with their dolls in all capacities & love them. If you are buying this for a little girl, be advised that the doll is large & heavy. We bought the hispanic version for our brunette caucasian daughter & she was thrilled to have a baby that ""looks like me."" We had no problem changing from spanish to english language."
1,SO VERY Disappointed!!!,"I got the baby alive Hispanic doll for my daughter for Christmas. I opted for the Hispanic doll becuase I thought my daughter would learn a bit of the two languages as we speak French primarily in our home.I must have received a broken doll because our doll is nothing like the description. She does not speak English at all...you can press her bracelet a million times and no English. And when she does speak, her English is slurred and unintelligible. We have contacted Amazon several times and have had them decline a return. After 2 months, we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Would not recommend at all!!! The reason that this rating received one star is because my daughter loves her death even though she does nothing."
3,over rated baby doll,"I purchased the doll as a Christmas gift for my four year old daughter. The lips began to peel on the first day of use. By the second day, the pink coloring on the lips wore completely off. Buyer beware."
5,most enjoyable :),"I read the reviews here at Amazon and bought the video. Not too shabby. I was hoping for some more beautiful 'eye-popping' battle sequences, but instead I got several scenes of heated political debates. Not a bad trade, really!So if you're a youngster like me, and looking for a great war movie, with lots of typical blood and guts battle sequences, look elsewhere. The movie's still a great place to start if you're interested in the history of the Spanish Civil War, and the whole Marxist global uprising in general. And those heated debates are great :) I don't believe I've ever seen a film where soldiers return from battle and then start up talk on ideology and international revolution.."
5,in brief praise of Ken Loach's LAND AND FREEDOM,"Ken Loach is a terrific filmmaker, the rare director and writer who is able to breathe life into scenes that pivot on political dialogue without being didactic, contrived, or overly intellectual. And this is one of his great films. If you're interested in the Spanish Civil War, the power of class, or great historic cinema, then this is a must see film. It has much of the power Orwell's HOMAGE TO CATALONIA but without Orwell's somewhat antiseptic and Anglo-centric narrative. At any rate, a great film!"
4,A More Balanced View,"As Americans we have been fed a rather romantic line about the Spanish Civil War: the freedom loving country people resisting the evil Franco and his Fascist / Nazi thugs.If you are a little more discerning you find that this was not the case: The freedom fighters were soon betrayed by the Soviets (who had an agenda other than freedom) and eliminated. The Left killed 35,000 priests and religious workers. It turned out to be Stalin and Hitler using Spain as a surrogate field of battle.We are all sinful men, and civil wars bring out the very worst in us as brother kills brothers. This is a poignant account of idealism being confronted by reality. Well acted and poignant. A small window into life."
3,Land and Freedom,"The acting in the film is exceptional, especially the female protagonist. The problem with the film is that it doesn't adequately develop its two principal concerns: the Stalinist/Marxist betrayal of the Spanish Civil War and the developing romantic relationship between the protagonists. Lesser concerns are left undeveloped as well, such as David Hart's life after his return from the revolution. All we know is that his granddaughter reads Hart's old letters and newspaper clippings after his death. The lifetime effect of the revolution on Hart is anyone's guess. The film's virtue is its historical accuracy.The significance of the Spanish Civil War can hardly be explored in 109 minutes. The film needed to be much longer."
5,Amazing . . .,"This album is outstanding, and yet . . . Every time I hear it I want to hear him live. And I did, two days after I heard this CD for the first time. The concert blew me through the wall. He must be heard live to be believed. If you can't make one of his few shows in this country, settle for this album. Otherwise, hie thee to a show and be prepared to get knocked out by his phenomenal beauty, power, and just damn grooviness. Outrageous."
4,Good :),"I received the item in good condition, not perfect. The shipping wasn't long and everything went okay with the payment."
3,"A little bulky, but REALLY cute!","I put this watch on my Amazon wishlist before Christmas and I found it in my stocking on Christmas morning. I was beyond excited! I normally don't wear a watch, but I like that this is a stretchy, bracelet type and doesn't have a latching system, you just slip it on. My wrists are not tiny, and this fits perfectly. The red is really a good color, too! I have received multiple compliments from strangers on my watch and it looks good with just about everything.I have to say that I can't wear this for prolonged periods because due to the fact that it is hard plastic, it makes my wrist sweat after a while. I don't know if it's just me or if it would happen to anybody, but I've never had a watch that made my wrist sweat before.I don't reach for this watch and wear it as much as I thought I would, but it's a cute occasional accessory AND it keeps time."
4,Beautiful watch Good company,Bought this watch for my wife. She loves it. Watchband broke - Nixon quickly replaced it at no charge.
3,Its okay,"The watch was big for my wrist, not as good item as I expected and as the money that I pay for it."
2,Well played but dull,"These performances of Schubert 3 and 6 are extremely well played but flat as a pancake. One of the problems with studio recordings is that conductors are too concerned with technical perfection and forget about the spirit of the music. There is little charm here and even less passion. I bought this CD because the same conductor and orchestra made a superlative recording of Schubert 1 and 2. Unfortunately, the spirit and passion of that CD is totally missing here. I would avoid this CD."
5,In Glorious Black And White!,"This is a dark and moody film noir from Hollywood's Golden Age of Cinema, and even though it wasn't the big hit the studio expected, it has gained cult status from almost the moment it was released. And lot of it has to do with the great acting and chemistry between Ingrid Bergman, who's been one of my favorite actresses since I was a kid and Charles Boyer. Flawless performance by Ms. Bergman and Mr. Boyer, and kudos also to Charles Laughton and Louis Calhern who almost steals the show from Miss Bergman and Mr. Boyer.I remember buying the VHS tape way back in 1983 and even though the quality was awful it was better than nothing, however, the transfer to DVD has considerably improved the picture as well as the sound quality of the film. All in all, and wonderful, dark, moody, cinematic experience."
2,Bergman is beautiful; film is not,"The main reason I bought Arch of Triumph was because of Ingrid Bergman. She is one of my favorite actresses. I had never seen this film before, and I have to admit I found it slow and somewhat dull. The storyline is set in occupied Paris, and one would think that this would put some excitement and suspense into the film, but it just meanders along. The characters that Charles Boyer and Bergman portray are somewhat annoying, and despite the talents of the two stars, it's hard to feel much sympathy for their plight. Bergman looks fantastic--she may never have looked better than in this film--but it's too bad the screenplay does not match her beauty. Hard-core Ingrid Bergman fans may still be interested in picking up this DVD."
2,"Arch of Triumph, gloom and doom","Arch of Triumph is film noir at its worst. Badly filmed, written and acted. A study in how to produce a bad film. Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton and Ingrid Bergman couldn't save thid turkey. It's a dark, too much contrast print which doesn't help. Much of it takes place at night which doesn't help either."
2,Something was seriously missing here...,"I think it was plot. It's a tragedy that dear Ingrid and Charles had to work with such material... It actually wasn't a bad story - it just needed a lot of help. It's hard to review a movie that didn't present itself clearly so I'll just say... While it wasn't unendurable, it had little in it to make me want to see it twice... The only reason I would buy it would be to say, yes I have it. It does have Ingrid after all. But whether I would ever unwrap it and view it is another story.There were a few good moments. Unfortunately they got so mixed up in the rainy haze that I can't remember what they were. This is definitely only for people who are Ingrid freaks like me and even I wasn't moved by it.Well, so much for that. I think I shall cease reviewing this now and move on to another movie..."
1,A Dull and Somber film,"Indeed a dull and somber film. I could hardly stay awake during the first hour. Bergman and Boyer do what they can with shoddy material but their characters are somewhat unlikeable, especially Bergman's. One really doesn't care what happens to them. When one doesn't care what happens to the characters in a movie, its a bad sign for the movie. I was extremely disappointed with this film. It is very slow-paced in all aspects. Charles Laughton, that great wonderful actor is completely wasted in this film as are Bergman and Boyer."
3,A Decent but Mixed Bag,"This Iron Maiden tribute 2-CD is a hodge-podge of mostly lesser known bands trying thier best to recreate some of Maiden's finest. The production and quality is sorely lacking on only a small number offerings, otherwise the production is pretty decent for an independent issue. Sebastian Bach's effort at ""Children of the Damned"" is the highlight of the whole package. Other notables are Eleventh Hour with ""Alexander the Great"" and The Quill's ""Where Eagles Dare"".This 2-CD is not without its comical moments either as there is an instrumental version of ""The Trooper"" accompanied by trombone and saxophone. Overall, not a bad take, but only for the most serious of Maiden fans."
1,THis is not a tribute to Maiden.. It's an offense !!,"The category of the bands included in this so-called ""tribute"" is so low, that I think this is an offense to MAIDEN, a band still kicking and live after their recent amazing recording ""BRAVE NEW WORLD"". If you're a real Maiden fan, you'll want nothing to do with this horrible project. If this was endhorsed by MAIDEN itself, it's a shame ..."
3,Mediocre,"Sebastian Bach's Children of the Damned is the only reason to buy this album. Bach rips through the song as well, if not BETTER, than Iron Maiden themselves. Truly a classic.The other songs on this album are poor, if not mediocre at best."
1,"ROD, HOW MUCH MONEY ???","I think Maiden must have received a good money by permitting the recording of this garbage. Otherwise, I don't know if their manager, Rod Smallwood, would permit it. The band featuring here are so weak, the versions so uninspired, that this CD would pass to oblivion forever, without nobody noticing it ..."
5,Looks good,"Looks pretty good, could have had a Puerto Rican flag or a a Coqui on it, but still nice. The versions with a flag on them are cheap plastic."
5,2 in 1 / 2 en 1,"This is an opportunity! ""Exitos"" is not a greatest hits cd at all, it includes all the songs of two music productions: ""Ahora Es"" (1989) and ""7+1=Vecinos"" (1990). If you are a Milly's fan and you don't have this two cd's, let's buy this one now. My favorite songs are: ""Volando bajito"", ""Tú no te lo mereces"", ""La ola latina"", ""Calimin y Chulumen"" and ""La Reina"". ""Exitos"" includes a bachata ('Viejo Luis') and two merengues in english. Enjoy it!¡Esta es una oportunidad! ""Exitos"" no es realmente un cd de éxitos, más bien incluye todas las canciones de dos producciones anteriores: ""Ahora Es"" (1989) y ""7+1=Vecinos"" (1990). Si eres un fan de Milly y no tienes estos CD, compra éste ya. Mis canciones favoritas son"" ""Volando bajito"", ""Tú no te lo mereces"", ""La ola latina"", ""Calimin y Chulumen"" y ""La Reina"". El cd incluye una bachata ('Viejo Luis') y dos merengues en inglés. ¡Disfrútalo!"
1,It's NOT DELUXE,"I also bought this dumbed down version only to find out there is a deluxe available for an extra $29-- no mention of this on the box. This version is very lame - you can't even cut and paste from the viewer to another application. My advice, is go with Quick View - it's the full package for about the price of this dumbed down and fairly worthless File Viewer."
3,Ok,"I got this cd because I felt sorry for it sitting in the used cd section for alomst a year at some cd shop. I got it for like a buck and I thought it was ok. Only tracks I card about were Real and the last one by AP. AP will sprucen up any mix though. :) With a name like ""Messiah"" you set your expectaions high. If you don't deliver, you will sit on cd shelfs for $1 for eternity I guess. Better off naming yourself ""DJ Shoe"" or something basic so that way you can pleasantly suprise everyone if you are good. :)"
4,Three panel dark cherry room divider,"This product seams to be well built, no cheap hinges and the finsih is top quality. It looks great in my living room."
2,"Hit or miss, this one is a miss...","...it started off pretty interesting, brutal gore effects as this guy starts chopping off a female body, then about two deaths later the movie just takes one big dump. We jump from one thing to another totally different, and you are left counfused as to what is the whole point of the story. This is not typical Fulci as there is humor implemented in some of the deaths which I found odd for a Fulci flick. There was just too much confusion here for anything to connect, and at the end I was a bit disappointed with this one. If you are a Fulci fan get it to add to your collection, otherwise steer clear or rent it only."
3,whistle through this short book,"Don't confuse this book with A. S. Byatt's much longer novel of the same name. This one is a very quick read with language in the style of Tobacco Road. The characters in this book have a lot more sense, though, and deal with adversity in a very matter-of-fact and effective manner. In fact, the book lacks any major conflict. Georgeanna is a very likeable protagonist, and she efficiently resolves the disagreements with her mother Chaney and with John Fleeting. It's a nice story about a nice person, and sometimes that's OK. Plus, I found out that many barbecue joints are called ""The Pig and Whistle"" because pigs and whistling are both considered to be bad luck on a ship. Presumably when a sailor comes back to shore, he's ready to enjoy the very things that have been off-limits while at sea."
5,Stunning,"The quality of this performance is stunning. Performed by the composer, the Shostakovich piano concertos sparkle on this recording. The orchestra that helped to create this stunning performance is lively and rhythmical. Shostakovich's upbeat and intriguing piano concertos draw each individual listener into the music. Whether you are a fan of classical music or just someone looking for some good music, I am sure that you will appreciate this CD. Trust me; I am a classical pianist, and I have won several piano competitions. This stunning CD is an amazing investment.By the way, if you enjoy this CD, you might want to buy a CD of Chopin's equally stunning piano concertos!"
2,"Talented writer's debut novel is weak, very weak","I really wanted to give this book two or three stars, but one character commits an act of such callous disregard for the safety of two female companions that I could not do it. Mr. Smith certainly has the talent to create many a blood chilling moment (and many are peppered throughout this somewhat over long book), but the characters act in stupid and/or uneven ways for the sake of advancing the plot. Bad sign that - it means the writer did not fully grasp his characters or his story. Better luck with your next book Mr. Smith."
1,"Awful, dreadful, stupid!","This book may not be the worst I ever read, but it's close. The plot is weak at best, the narration wouldn't pass at juvenile level. It's packed with so many cliches--bad one's!--at times it makes one retch. (And let's not even get into the fact that a lot of things don't make any sense; and that references are made to what happened...when they didn't happen that way...). It's awful! Don't read it!"
5,"One of the best horror novels I've ever read, great action","I think this Lucifer guy from NY has missed the boat on When Shadows Fall. This book packs more action and fright than any King or Koontz book. If you've ever been bored with the lengthy digressions of those authors, and want to scream ""Let's get on with it!"" you're in for a treat. Smith was woven more elements into a horror novel than anyone I've read so far (and I've read quite a few). It's a real tour de force of terror. I highly recommend it, and can't wait for his next."
2,More of the same old Satanic Panic stuff,"If you've read one, you've read them all. Smith offers nothing new here and worst yet he mixes up Wicca with Satanism. If you enjoyed the first 2 Witchcraft movies then you'll love this! The most memorable part of this book is the dedication, the author dedicates this to Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Straub, and so on. Well, I call that an insult. For if the masters of Horror are inspiring work like this then they must be stopped! For true Satanic horror read Rosemary's Baby and Dark Debts!"
3,Incomplete Description but Okay Product,"I purchased this inline water filter to place on our washer cold water line to keep the trash from stopping the water flow. There is a female connector on one end as shown in the photo, and I assumed there was a male water hose connector on the opposite end.When it arrived I discovered the other end needed a water hose adapter in order to make it a true inline water filter. I finally found one at a Gilroys Got It hardware store because neither Lowes nor Home Depot carried it.If you are purchasing this for a similar use as I had, please be aware that you will need that adapter. It's another $4.00."
2,not very interesting.....,"This movie couldn't hold my attention, despite a very attractive leading character and a moderately hot male-on-male kiss....If you're looking for a vampire movie or a horror/soft-core film (ala the movies in ""the Brotherhood"" series), skip this one."
4,Good for a worship album,"This definitely comes from Jeremy Camp's heart but it just doesn't have the same edge of the first album. The reason behind this could be because he had made this album before he made Stay. He says this album is more directed toward youth, this sound like it's more likely to be directed to the middle age crowd. Lyrically wise this album is great, but beside one or two of these songs from this album. It seem bland to me but I've only listened to it three times. So who knows."
3,It is what it is,Good voice and solid lyrics. I'd go on but why bother it's just an opinion anyways.
5,Great album from a real artist,"I am not a your typical christian music fan. Many times the music and lyrics are not very powerful, but with Jeremy Camp you can't go wrong. The song ""walk by faith"" is awesome. Trust me, buy this album you won't be sorry. His voice and music are second to none. This band is by far the best chrisitan band around. If you like Mercy Me, you will Love Jeremy...he is much more talented."
5,Awesome!!,I have enjoyed this cd sooooo much!!! It seems like I'll never get tired of it. He did a GREAT job again
3,Early Release,"""Night of Power"" (1985) is Spider's third or fourth novel and as such isn't quite up to the standards of his later work. In it he wrestles with white liberal guilt over the state of race relations in America. The long interior monologues by the narrator/author get preachy and wan, the characters are cartoonlike, and the action is way over the top. However as with any Spider book there are moments of sublime pleasure and delicious wordplay, and if the novel helped him work through some of the very real issues involved then it was certainly a therapeutic project. It's interesting to see several threads appear which would later be woven into his body of work."
4,Wild journey into the night of black Manhattan...,"""Night Of Power"" is based in Manhattan, in a nebulous futurewhere smog is serious enough to cause people to live indomes and racial violence has increased beyond anyone'sworst nightmares.What would you do if confronted with a racewar? More thanthat, what would you do if stuck on Manhattan Island whileit is being taken over?This is a twisted tale into the minds of a caucasian familyas they struggle their way through the Manhattan suburbs, onthis Night of Power. Well worth the read!"
2,Fiction is fiction,"I am a big fan of te Calihan books that Spider Robinson puts out. Seeing Spider's name on this book and the fact that i loved his previous reads is the reason i picked up this book.When i read diction i read it as an escape from reality and not to read in any social relevance.With all that bein said before hand, i didn't find this book to be all that great. it wasn't an escape for me. it seems more of a call to arms for the African American people.I am sorry if this offends people here. I just didn't get a lot out of it except that it was ok to rise up against your country....Which it isn't"
2,smells awful,"It is good conditioner, however, in the shower it smell unpleasant. You can't smell it throughout the day though."
4,acceptable versions of Mozart sonatas,This CD contains some prototypical Mozart. The sound quality is good and so is the playing. There is nothing really all that remarkable about it however so there might be other preferrable versions. The price is excellent.
4,Jack is great!,"Fun adventure movie. Some historical background, and held my interest. Seems like lots of twists and turns, and great for popcorn."
5,I passed,"I am an IMG and I would highly recommend this book at least to all other IMGs studying for this exam. In my case, it was all I needed to pass the test. Just memorize everything in the book, it reflected my exam great deal. Good luck!"
5,Outstanding guide to passing the step 2 CS,"Like the companion publications for step 1 and step 2 CK, the step 2 CS provides an excellent guide to the preparation required for the CS exam. I found the tips on time management, and the range of cases presented to be comprehensive and extremely useful. Highly recommended for any student or physician taking the step 2 CS."
5,greeting,"I would like to share my review with you all , it was excellent book and too fast delivery ."
5,This is the only book that you need to pass the step2 CS,This is the only book that you need to pass the step2 CS. Seriously. Don't read anything else. Just read this book and do the cases from usmleworld and that is the only thing that you need to pass the step 2CS.
2,Nope,If you speak good English and went to a US medical school you only need to read the introduction of this book to learn about how the test day runs. All the other stuff about what questions to ask and how to answer them and how to do the physical exam you should already know from the past 4 years. If you are an IMG it might be useful.
3,"Ok, But Not the Best Book for Step 2 CS","I read this book along with the two Kaplan books, and felt that this one was the least helpful of the three. You can see my review comparing all three books on theKaplan Medical USMLE Step 2 CS: Complex Cases: 35 Cases You Are Likely to See on the Exam (Kaplan USMLE)page."
4,A good seller...:),I found that since i didn't get the book in the beginning but when I contacted the seller & showed my concern...he sent me another book ...& I got that one in the time when he said & it was as he told me about it so it was quite a good experience overall....Thanks....:)
4,Very helpful for CS,"This review book was very helpful in taking Step 2 CS. It contains more info than you need, but is organized in a manner where you can easily skip what you don't need. The ""minicases"" were tremendously helpful, if for no other reason than just brushing up on diagnoses I hadn't thought about in months... If you have time, you can look over the practice cases, but those are skippable if you're crunched for time. I started reviewing 1 week prior to the exam & I think I did just fine."
5,SUPER IMPORTANT ITEM,"THIS IS A BASIC FOR PASSING STEP 2 CS, FOR DIAGNOSIS AND WORK UP, THE MINICASES ARE VERY HELPFULL, BUY IT WITH CONFIDENCE, IT IS A GREAT BOOK"
2,"Ehhhh, maybe","If your'e bottom 10% of your class, sleep through rotations, and struggle with communication this book will save your bacon. If the preceeding 3 categories don't apply to you, save your money, or read a good Tom Clancy instead."
2,Is this really gospel?,"Out of Eden is a great band but is this really gospel music? They seem to have alot of potential but where do you hear the words God, Jesus, Lord, anything? The only reason I gave this CD a two is because the music is great. It's just the lyrics that are quite confusing. Why is this labeled 'Christian Music'. I would not advise anyone to get it who is looking for a CD that gives God the praise and worship he deserves."
1,Not music you would Praise God with,"This was my first OOE CD. I bought because everyone talked about their music so well. Well first off, if you've never heard them don't buy this one. Especially if you put a gospel Cd in to praise or worship God. How is anyone supposed to surrender to God with music like this. You have no idea this is a Christian CD. There hardly ever say the words God, Lord, Jesus. Its not worth you $18 bucks. I'd save it and buy Mary Mary"
5,Out of Eden's best album,"This is OOE's best album. I like the urban feel they bring to this CD. I must admit that i do have a little crush on Lisa Kimmey though, but since i'm only 17 i will settle to be her spiritual little brother. I love the innocent sound of Andrea's voice, and the creativity of Danielle. Much love to my sisters of OOE. RecommendedGod Bless,"
2,WHAT???,"This is a good cd to dance to in the car but if some of the old ladies in my church heard this they would say ""is that church music""? I don't mean any harm but this is not really gospel music. It's noting like THIS IS YOU LIFE which was my favorite cd. I downloaded ""I know"" and let's just say it didn't really make sense! What does this song have to do with God. We should always give god the glory and this cd didn't in most of the songs. I rarely heard god,lord or jesus. I would not recommend this cd if you are a life long christian."
4,"It's not for the 'Super"" Religious","For all of you who had negative things to say about this LP:""I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some."" (Paul,an Apostle; 1Corinthians 9:19-23)1. I love this ""album""/CD (who has any vinyl now a days).2. It can be inspiring to many who hear it. Especially the last song, Not Worthy. We are unworthy of the gift of Life that we have, and Out of Eden did a wonderful job of singing to the Almighty about it.3. Religion and the ""where is Jesus, Lord?"" attitude will not help many outside of the church. (that's another post for another time)In Summary: I reccomend this CD to anyone who likes music, likes positive messages, and wants to hear the gospel (GOOD NEWS) over music!If you want to hear banging tambourines, feet stomping, and hollering, then buy something else..."
3,Better than average,"Not a glowing review title but I wasn't amazed by the album either. I enjoy it for sure but overall it tends to drone on and sound like a lot of their other music. More Than You Know is their best album hands down so check that one out before this one. Otherwise it is a decent album, peppy, well produced but you can barely tell what they're singing about and the harmonizing gets old..."
3,Good!,"This time, I found out that there exists ""Beethoven- Symphony No.9"", my favorite masterpiece, which great composer Mahler re-orchestrated. I felt excited at this finding."
5,Planer dust hood assembly,It is a little pricey but it is very well built works great very little dust or shavings end up on the floor .... i would recommend this item to anyone who has a dust collector system . It is a great add on to my Hitachi 12RA planer/joiner .....
2,Promising but disappointing,"I bought this book for research work related to the events of the last week before the crucifixion. Some of the very basic information was helpful but the book did what a lot of books about the New Testament do - it assumed that you have to be an expert on history, sociology, linguistics and theology in order to really understand the text. I don't have a commitment to a lot of things Frederick Nietsche wrote on the whole, but when he said, ""The text has finally been buried under the interpretation"" it applies supremely to a book like this. It will provide resources for discussion for those people who are Christian professionals and academics, but not much useful information for people who want to discover Jesus by reading and understanding the words of the gospels."
2,Not for me,"The search for ""the historical Jesus"" and the assumptions made around that whole conversation are paramount in this work. If you believe that Jesus the man was primarily about socio/political fixes to the world's problems you will probably like this book. If you believe his mission was much bigger than that - atoning sacrifice, etc. - then pass it by."
3,Interesting subject - could be written more gripping.,"To me, this book presents a plausible approach to a Jesus who cared about us. My Christian faith asks me to keep an open mind. This book is not about ridiculing faith, but about what the story of Jesus represents.Faith is something that is above the assumptions in this book. That makes writing and reading about it so important. This book led me to read more on the subject. Here on Amazon I found the novel 'Journey To Eden' by Max J. Pucher, a completely unknown writer. Its female lead character mirrors my personal experience: 'I can feel faith in my heart and nothing anyone ever says could explain it away.'Thus I can recommend Borg's work in this book. I'm not excited about its writing style that builds on the assumption that we know what happened in Jerusalem. We don't know what happened and for me the mystery makes Jesus such a wonderful element of faith."
5,The Last Week,A valuable book for all Christians. It is helping me understand Jesus and his mission better.
3,They say everything and nothing,"Borg and Crossan have always been lucid, enjoyable, and intelligent communicators. But it has never been clear what their actual message was, and when they write together, the message is doubly vague. Essentially, they are both masters of having their cake and eating it at the same time. So Jesus has always been all things to all men. There's nothing really to nitpick in this book, apart from the lack of insight into Jesus' purpose - indeed, like most authors, Borg and Crossan are loathe to suggest Jesus was a man with a plan. We already know the theological view of his life and death, but the authors fail to offer any convincing alternative to it. As ever, liberal Christians will love this, and evangelicals will loathe it."
5,Excellent Book,Fantastic. I ordered hard copy as well as kindle edition. This book gave me so much insure to the account of Jesse cruxificion
5,The First Holy Week,"This book is heavy-duty serious work by two famous scholars on the Holy Week that was critical in forming the new religion later known as Christianity. The themes are death and resurrection, crucifixion and vindication.The risen Jesus has 'all authority in heaven and on earth'. It means imperial power that killed him as no authority. The commission to his followers is to make disciples of all nations by his example of love and justice. The teaching ' to obey everything I have commanded you' means actions, not belief. This will be a good measurement to check against the past two millenniums. ' I am with you always ' is a powerful echo of his birth ""Emmanuel"".The seven-day saga is a powerful transformation especially in making Saul to Paul, a cult of Judaism into a new world religion. Millions undergo the born again experience to start a new life. In our daily life, do you meet the real Jesus, false Christians, Judas and doubting Thomas?"
3,Christmas out on the range,"You'll get a real feeling of being out on the prairie or at least knowing what it might be like on Christmas Eve miles away from any town, surrounded by your fellow cowboys and several thousand head of cattle. Some traditional, some more modern, and a few originals are included on this CD. Good for throwing into the holiday music mix."
5,Christmas the Cowboy Way,"""Riders in the Sky"" are always great. Once again sound quality is superb. Songs such as ""The Christmas Yodel"", Side Meat's Christmas Stew"", and ""The Prairie Dogs Christmas Ball"" are ones I had never heard...and I have been around going on 74 years! ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" contain different lyrics than what we are traditionally familiar with, having been adapted to ""Side Meats"" humorous manner of thinking and speaking. This latter song contains some worthwhile yodeling and is worth the price of the entire album."
5,What a fun Christmas album,I must admit that I love the Riders in the Sky anyway so this review is probably slanted that way. But the songs and energy of these guys is wonderful and some of the songs are new to me so I loved it. Highly recommned you add to your Christmas collection.
3,"I laughed when I heard it, in spite of myself","This is a decent Christmas album, done in a Western harmony style that is reminiscent of the Sons of the Pioneers. It's well enough done, but to be honest, I was expecting it to be funnier. There is some humor, but most of the songs are done ""straight"". And the songs that are ""funny"" are pretty corny. But if you like that sort of thing, you should enjoy this album."
1,Cheesy non--Cowboy and non--Christmas,"Other reviews led me to think that this would be related to the work of the Sons of the Pioneers. Very disappointed!!! If I heard this music in a bar or club I would leave IMMEDIATELY. Cheesy, cheap, not charming, not Christmas. Very un--happy with this selection. I grew up in New Mexico and have heard a lot of western music, so I do have more than a little experience with Western music. Avoid this one!!!!"
4,good as expected,the filter that arrived on time is good replacement and even better than the oem part. value for money for such product
3,A brief overview of magical history,"Although now somewhat out-of-date, Florence Farr's turn-of-the-century overview of Egyptian magical techniques is still an engaging and readable summary of techniques ranging from early pharonic era records to the aeonist rites of the later coptic gnostics. It's actually quite helpful as a cross-reference source for dealing with later, more specialized works focusing on some narrower field, which often forget that Egypt was a great crossroads, that borrowed heavily from outside traditions, and was in turn heavily borrowed from."
2,Economics primer with a right-wing bias,"As others have written, this text is reasonably well-written and organized. However, it has a clear bias, presenting and defending a right-wing agenda. For example:*Taxes, unions, environmental protection, transfer payments are bad.*School vouchers, social security reform to presonal retirement accounts, medical savings accounts are good ideas.Of course I oversimplify (slightly), but whatever side of these and other issues one might fall, it's pretty clear that the other side is given short shrift.A minor beef I had with this text is that too many of its examples cater to the college student."
5,Teaches basic economics,"If you have time and want to learn macro and micro economics fundamentals and how it can applied in a practical setting, then is the book for you. I used this book for my MBA program.The author has used examples, charts, graphs , figures etc to drive home the concepts.If you want to learn economics in 24 hrs, this is not the book for you."
1,Biased opinions,"I only purchased this book for class. I was pleased to find that the book was easy to follow and helpful overall. However, I agree with previous customer reviews that the book was obviously written by right-wing biased opinions! I found myself cringing with each chapter! Beware!"
5,Exquisite,"What an exquisite recording of beautiful music! Megan and Mary have excellent rapport and play with subtle colors and nuances to create a most serene atmosphere. Megan's tone is supple, bouyant, free, warm, perfectly in tune. A beautiful recording."
1,"Good film, crappy DVD","This is a very good rock film, featuring a band who sadly had little success in America, even though they were immensely popular in the U.K. and Europe.Unfortunately, Sony did a really poor job with this DVD. The print they used is generally in good condition. However, the film was shot in Panavision (2.35:1 aspect ratio), but on the DVD only the credits are the full widescreen. The rest of the film is only slightly letterboxed, so that characters are routinely cut off the sides and the whole film has an ""off-kilter"" feel to it.On top that, Sony (in it's apparent never-ending desire to keep those dreaded black bars as small as possible) has made the height of the image slightly too tall, so that every edit (cut) in the film appears as a quick white line at the top of the picture. It's VERY distracting in the many dark scenes in the movie.Don't the people at Sony who do the work on these DVD releases have ANY quality control or take ANY pride in their product?"
2,Not for me,"I just bought this and cannot say how disappointed I am. I read almost all the reviews and still never came away with the information that there are virtually no performances by Slade on this. It's the only reason I bought the film - I love Slade, but I want to see them perform, not act! Does no live Slade exist on film?"
5,Good quality,The size is perfect. It fits in my drawer and is good for organizing small items.It has good quality.
4,Pantry Organizers,"I bought these to organize granola bars and little individual sized lunch sack treats (fruit roll ups, raisin boxes, cracker packs, etc). They work quite well on my 8"" deep pantry shelves. My husband says it now looks like a candy store in our pantry. :)Unexpectedly each bin has a nice slide in slot for a label, which will be useful in identifying types of granola bars.The only thing more I could wish for was that the boxes actually snapped together, rather than just balancing on one another. I have visions of a grabby hand inadvertently toppling a whole tower (I have the bins stacked 5 high) of treats to get to the back of the bottom bin. I guess if it proves to be a problem I may just super glue the bins together."
2,Kind of a Rip-Off,"Don't get me wrong, the book is okay. But I feel O'Reilly simply slung out a new version of the book for PHP 5, without really updating the content to reflect PHP 5's enhancements. Especially the chapter covering OOP development with PHP 5. The content in that chapter is pure PHP 4. Not cool."
2,"Too many errors, even in april 2006 edition","One shelf in my bookcase looks like a zoo with all those animals on the cover. I appreciate the books of O'reilly very much. But this particular book is really disappointing which is reported already many times. But the rating is still 4 star at this moment which is way too high. And I'm writing about the April 2006 edition. Too many errors, no complete code, examples of older (too old, and deprecated) php versions, layout problems, etc. etc. I really don't get it how they can produce a book like this."
5,simply beautiful!,"This book is well written and an extremely easy read. The coverage is very very comprehensive yet concise! If you were worried about dragging through another 1400 page wrox book just to grasp another language, you will want to run and get this book. You will pick up PHP fast with no delay. It is around 380 pages along with a nice reference area of php functions. If you are a web developer who wants to pick up PHP quickly simply purchase this book. Folks with only html experience can also expect to have an excellent understanding of PHP by the end of the book, although I suggest that the book be read by someone with some form of previous web programming experience. This is only because certain coverage is very efficient and may be hard to keep up with if you are a complete novice in web programming basics.Did I forgot to mention that the co-author is the creator of PHP!! :)"
4,good stuff,"easy to read and very illuminating on the working of PHP, however, I was hoping for more dirty details and advanced examples. Basically a thicker book would have made me happy"
4,Rasmus *is* an author,"I'm the editor of Programming PHP. I can vouch for the fact that Rasmus was a fully-fledged author. Besides fact-checking everything that the other authors wrote, he contributed many chapters of his own. I don't know where the idea that Rasmus was ""just supervising"" or ""has not done any major writing"" came from (it's not a conclusion you could come to from actually *reading* the book) but it's absolutely wrong.By all means be vague (""fairy land"") and strange (LDAP and SNMP as ""what makes PHP what it is today""?!) in reviews, but please don't be dishonest.For my rating of this book, by the way, I came as close to the current average ranking as I could. I'm obviously not impartial (I think the book's a 5!) but I don't want my partiality to bias the reader ratings."
4,"Programming PHP, 2nd Edition (PHP 5)","I'm assuming via the dates of the other reviews, that most of them are referring to Version 1.I have Version 2 with me and after reading a few chapters, have come to the conclusion that this is a worthwhile investment.The author(s) appear to have read my mind as I thought about counter examples (""what about in this case?""), for in the following paragraph such concerns are addressed.This is an easy read and easily absorbed; yet not too verbose (yawn).I'm giving it 4/5 stars, simply because there's no downloadable example code. But that is a minor issue; for me.This is a good book and I shall keep it."
1,"Full Of Errors, Not For Beginners","This book has code examples which are full of typos. For example, the code for ""self-processing pages"" on page 166 won't parse. The publisher's list of unconfirmed errata goes on for 12 printed pages. This is in addition to the confirmed errata, another 2 pages. It does not look like the book's authors want to acknowledge their mistakes or participate in correcting them.If you are a beginner, steer clear of this book. If you do get it, be prepared to spend a considerable amount of time researching each and every parse error."
2,not worthed,"It sure tries to teach you something but cannot achieve...As everyone mentioned before, it has countless errors and typos. But there is more than that. Book is out of focus. Examples makes no sense and not related to each other, which is very confusing.A piece of code here and other piece is there. Every example is coming out of nowhere. It doesn't have a project. So everytime different variables, situations. Like, in one example it uses Flintstones character names ($name=Fred, $name2 = fred etc.). Next example is subjects of a class (math, science, history, english etc.), on other one it uses very random strings like (""I like paris in november"", ""the key is in my pants"")If you want to learn PHP, stick with ""PHP and MySQL Web Development, Second Edition"" By Luke Welling, Laura Thompson."
3,"Not the best, but decent","It's not the best computer language book I have ever read, by a long shot, but it did give me most of what I needed. I found a number of errors, including places where the example code differs from the text description. This is mostly the editor's fault. Also, there were a number of important details that were left out. This brings me to my main concern: it is not clear who this book was written for. A novice would be overwhelmed, I think, while a more experienced programmer like me may be frustrated with some critical omissions. On the whole, though, it did get the job done."
2,Disappointing,"O Reilly publishes the best programming books--they're accurate, elegant and get to the point quickly. Unfortunately, this book is an exception. I agree with the complaints of the other reviewers, e.g., the text has buried information and incorrect examples. However, my main ojection is the index. It appears that the authors simply searched for every keyword in the book then tabulated them in the index. Thus, the index is hardly useful. It's no good to look through several pages just to find that the keyword was used once in a passing sentence that has little to do with that topic."
2,"a learning book, but not a useful one","Let me start by saying in general O'Reilly books have been the best books I've picked up to learn from. The usually cover the basics in depth and then provide excellent examples and more advanced topics to ponder. This book covers the basics, mostly, and then procedes to fail to provide good examples, and really doesn't enter into the depths of PHP.Other more knowledgable people have said this already, I'm just helping drag the rating down to where it deserves to be, which is not more than 2 stars."
2,Mediocre coverage,"This book is a half baked attempt at teaching PHP programming.It has a poor organization,missing php functions, and lack of in-depth examples with good explanations.If your are a newbie to the world of PHP programming and desperately need a reference to get you started, this may be the book for you. If you have the will to fight it out and can't find any other resources, then this is a must-have.Its frustrating enough when you know what your looking for and can't find it. I find myself using the online documentation far more than I use this book.Also it seems like Rasmus has not done any major writing on this book and has been misleading to me as a customer."
2,Too shallow,"I was disappointed in this book. The title implies that the book would cover PHP in the same manner that Programming Perl (from the same publisher) covers Perl, but this is not true. Programming Perl is a very good in-depth reference for Perl, and I still use it frequently. Programming PHP is much too shallow, and I usually have to refer to the online PHP manual available at php.net instead."
2,Too Much PHP4 to be useful these days,"The ""Object Oriented"" portion of the book is a terrible reference for PHP5 programming, as it uses examples based on PHP4, which won't work in PHP5. ""Learning PHP5"" might be a better book for people seeking an up-to-date reference for occasional PHP programmers or learners."
3,Good one,"This book is more like a PHP dictionary. It's really not good for a new PHP programmer. But once you get familiar with this language and start your own project, you will find it's useful for you to find syntax and usage."
3,nice book,"Like many people I know, I have to use multiple programming languages, and php happens to be one of them. Programming PHP is a great book for PHP speakers and the excellent php function reference in appendix A is really adequate value for the book.Take heart, you can do without the book, if you don't already own a copy, but owning a copy is also a great way to support the community, so go get on."
3,I don't like it,"* I am an experienced programmer. I finished the first seven chapters in one day. Because the book is good or because I got used to programming ?? I am not sure.* The second day (today) I read chapter 8 Database. I can not understand anything X-( They say something like For more on SQL, see SQL in a Nutshell X-( And I don't know any about Databases so I can not read it.* The rest of the books cover some topics that I'm currently not interested in, I haven't read them, so I can not give any comments about these chapters. (in fact I have read some parts I think they are fine because I can understand :D)* The way the authors present information is not clear either. I think they put a little effort on it. Everything is so brief.This is definitely not a 5* book.4* ?? No. I am not pleased.3* ? Well, I got some basis of PHP. Thank the authors :-)"
2,Spy X The Code,I thought this book was very interesting.If you like books that are adventurous you would like this book.I hope that Peter Lerangis keeps adding to this series.I now that right now there are four book to this series.
2,A Thought,I loved the second one. I did not yet read the first one yet because I got the second one before the first one. Does the first book continue into the second book? Also if you liked this one you are going to like the second one!!!!!!!!!!
3,Spy X The code,"I thought this book was going to be like a short story of once upon a time, but it was about how their mom left and what they are doing to find her. Go Eve and Andrew!"
3,Ben Maccabee,"Watched the Movie...I love Wings Huser I'm a big fan. reason why I went to see the movie. than saw new comer Ben Maccabee and he blew me away. Old school hero, low key like Bronson and McQueen. As i researched into Maccabee's carear found out that he's the star of the 'true story of Hannibal' on the History channel. Like to see more of Maccabee....An anti hero like they used to be. (:"
3,the funk superheros back!,"Good cd, sadly no Muggs on the boards and no Funkdoobie members on any tracks. On the other hand, Battleaxe's productions have once again prooven themselves to be sick!! Fresh sounds with a Son Doobie rocking it like never before, verses that seem to stop the beat, delivered at an impressive & impeccable paste that'll leave you like... what?? well, i think that was phat, but lemme hear it again... All in all, i myself think i rated this cd pretty low but only cause i'm still hooked on BrothasDoobie. Cop this cd, right after you get the two predecents."
4,Great For Doors,"If you need to trim door slabs (other than pre-hung)- this is the best tool. It produces very smooth cuts with little effort. It is also quiet. I'm not sure if a dust bag is available - the tool throws a lot of dust, so be ready. I have used it to trim up to 1/4 inch of 80 inch long doors (precor masonite doors). The tool is prefect - provides a very straight finished edge that can not be accomplished using any other power tool, even a table saw"
4,Nice Machine with lots of uses,This machine is great! I've used it on several door installs and some other trim and finish work.
2,Good points lost in poor writing,"Boyle raises several interesting points regarding information law and he does bring a different way of deciphering the intricacies of copyright and information law. However, many times his arguments are lost in his use of analogies, references, and words which even an attorney can not understand. In other parts of his book, he provides little explanation of the economic theories which have been used by previous scholars to defend the current status of information law. This leaves the reader confused unless the reader is an economist by training. Although I agree with Boyle's view of information law as being bigger than it has previously been defined, I think his archaic style of writing leaves the reader more frustrated than enlightened. I recommend having Black's Law Dictionary and Webster's handy if you are going to read this book."
2,An interesting analysis gone horribly wrong.,"The first half of this book offers interesting analysis of the legal problems with valuing intellectual property. However, the second half of the book proscribes cures for the ""unfairness"" of intelect property with government deciding who contributed what value. It turns out to be no coincidence that his analysis begins with a quote from Karl Marx"
2,Whats wrong,"This Cd is first and formost a discrace to music. Yes Sublime is a very talented band with a good sense of music but what happened with this album? I'm looking at the inside cover and it says that all drums were PROGRAMED by Brad. WHAT, programed, the drums aren't real. How could a band with so much talent use a drum kit to make there album. Another thing is the songs sound [awful] because they were recorded in some dude's basement. I give it 2 stars because there are 4 or 5 good tracks. But if you want a real good CD with about 17 great tracks skip this and get 40. oz to Freedom or the self titled CD."
1,This CD blows,"I want to first start off by saying that I am a HUGE Sublime fan. This was the last of their three original CD's that I bought, and I was very disappointed in it. It has maybe 3 good songs on it. Also it has very poor quality sound, it sounds like it was recorded in somebodiess living room, which I later found out was true. Still though if you're really into Sublime, you might want to check it out."
5,Both are great,If you are a sublime fan and don't have em get em. These are great. Main reason to own 40.oz to freedom mca's verson dont have get out on it. You get it on second hand somke.Check Prices 40oz to Freedomwaiting for my rucaget out!40oz. to freedomsmoke two jointswe're only gonna die for our arrogance (early man)don't push5446/ball and chainbadfishlet's go get stonednew thrashscarlet begoniaslive at e'sd.j.'s (40oz.)chica mi tiporight backwhat happenednew songebindate rapehopekrs-onerivers of babylonthanxI have the new and the old 40.oz's. Get them both if you can. Cuz one has get out and the other don't. But if you have second hand smoke you can get....get out on second hand.
1,Not worth a dime,"If this is your idea of good music, the world is in a sad state of affairs. There is very little of anything good on this album,with the exception of maybe two songs."
1,worst sublime cd,"i REALLy dislike this cd. i just bought it, and i can't stand it! i love the S/T sublime cd, but i can't even listen to this! it's too......i dunno, it's like dance music or something. and there is barely any singing! so what's the point?"
5,I can smell the beach every time i listen to this album,"This album is great.. it's more than just music, it's a snapshot of life for the Sublime guys in Long Beach in the early 90s. Every time I listen to it, I can feel the warm LA sun and smell the ocean, no matter where I am.This album isn't something that you put in your ipod on shuffle, it needs to be listened to from start to finish to be fully appreciated. And don't go skipping those Raleigh tracks either. ;)"
5,Great buying experience!,"I went on a little Sublime buying spree for the Mr. Everything arrived quickly, and was in great shape! I would definitely buy from them again!"
4,A Good Sublime Record,This is a good album by Sublime but not there best. If you are a fan of their material and havn't heard this then you should get it for sure. But if your a more casual listener then greatest hits is for you.
4,you can see the soul,"This may not be a great mainstream, video, radio album. But this is some of the best jamming you'll find. Sublime without the pressure, the expectations, and the influence of the media and the fans. This is pure. Just the guys rockin out, lettin it flow. If you're into studio cuts, don't even bother. But if you wanna hear the minds of Sublime, this is the best you can find. Here are the beginnings of songs such as ""See Red"" and ""Santeria"" before they were honed to studio masterpieces. Also is the origin of the Smashmouth hit ""Walkin on the Sun."" Not until I began to listen to the song did I realize that Smashmouth hadn't created the song. It's amazing to see the process in which Sublime went through to reach the top. It's not often that artists can produce such quality music without the refinement by the studio. Yet this album will keep you jammin, and it has everything that makes Sublime who they are. This is the real deal, uncut and raw."
5,AS GREAT AS THE OTHERS,"This Sublime CD definately lives up to its reputation. Brad Nowell is one of the best songwriters. I especially love the song Pool Shark. Bradley sings with so much emotion. This CD is more ska and hip hop than the self-titled one and 40 oz. to Freedom, and some of the songs are just the band messing around...but this is another great Sublime CD."
4,Cult masterpiece,"Robbin the hood is only for sublime fans-take my word for it. Every one that i know that is not a hardcore sub fan like myself thought this album was poorly made and ""bootleg"". If u ask me its a cult masterpiece.. Saw red is the most popular song on the album but by far not the best track. Check out Pool Shark, Freeway Time in LA county Jail, Mary, All you need, and one of my favorites STP."
4,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"When I bought this CD, I was very dissapointed. On this CD there are 22 tracks.-12 have singing.-4 of the songs with singing are acoustic-6 are instrumental-3 have people saying some stuff with a lot of curses-1 is some guy rapping for 43 sec.I gave this CD 4 stars because Sublime is one of my favorite bands, and there are some great songs on here. This is what is wrong with the CD--There is no singing until track 4, which is Pool Shark, and it isnt a very good song. It's only 57 sec. long, and the music is so loud that you can barely hear Brad.-The songs aren't in a good order. Some will be fast, and then it will go into a slow song.-The art work suucks, just look at the cover of the CD.-Barely any singing.The CD isnt all bad, some of the music is good, and it has songs like Greatest Hits, Steppin' Razor,Cisco Kid, Boss DJ, All You Need, Pool Shark (acoustic), STP, and Saw RedBuy it if your a big fan, if not buy 40 oz. or SUBLIME"
2,little effort,"ok, to everyone who gave this 4 or 5 stars, GET REAL! at most this is 3 stars, but only because of the funny samples, which really dont count as songs. there ARE a couple of good songs and a couple good ""half-songs"". dont get me wrong, im a HUGE sublime fan. if you really love sublime like I do, buy this, but dont make it a top priority, maybe buy it used or something. like the others say, sound quality sux, production sux. this is really like a novelty cd, not a real album. trust me, no matter what the other guys say, NO-ONE listens to this cd regularly"
4,Great CD if you're a true Sublime fan,"Robin the Hood isn't as good as some of Sublime's other albums, but it's still really good. It's got great lyrics and keeps Sublime's dark traits in the songs, but it could ahve been better. I wouldn't recomend getting this album unless you're a true Sublime fan."
4,read this review it will help u alot,First of all the cd is good but you can only enjoy it if your a diehard sublime fan. Also you wont like it the first time you listen to it because of the stuff in between the songs. My advice is to go straight to the 4th song the first time you listen to it. Give it a chance but its not their best by far. I would buy the selftitled first to get into sublime then 40 oz. The album 40 oz. is better but the selftitled is a good introduction to sublime. Also the sound is pretty shady this is because it was made in living rooms on a 4-track recorder. Although is not great like 40 oz. but its definitley worth buying cause its better than any thing out now. Some good songs are steppin razor S.T.P Pook Shark.
3,"Good songs, but terrible recordings","There are some good songs on this cd, but i'm pretty sure brad just recorded all of this cd on a 4-track in somebodys living room. Most of it is a drum machine and stuff like that. Better versions of STP, Work that we do, Greatest Hits are all on the live album, steppin razor is good, but you know it could have been a lot better if they spent some more time on it. I love sublime, i have all their other cds except for the accoustic one, and this is the only one that isn't very good."
2,"Sublime's response to drugs, not music","if you want to listen to 'Sublime' don't listen to this first! there is 4/5 ok songs with 1/2 really good songs. the rest is fillers which is basically Brad on heroin having fun on a four track computer studio to have a laugh and p*ss off the music industry. this is not an album to sit down and chill with, but listen to snippets for fun. if Brad farted, i would listen to it, but even this i find it hard listening to in denial saying 'i like it' cos frankly - i dont! i APPRECIATE it as a notch on Sublime's belt, but it's not an Album, its a stupid trip. Listen to 40 oz to freedom as that is Sublime through and through with incredible songs THROUGHOUT"
4,Lovable Sublime,"For those of you who gave this album lower then a 3 stars ought to listen to other earlier types of ska before the record companies saw the big bucks in the business. Have you ever listened to the music mixed in garage studios? Of course, I'm not saying this album was produced in that manner. Robbin' the Hood may not be the over produced or commercialized album of the band but I believe this album is an early work of art for the group."
3,Gotta be a fan....,"... to appreciate this CD. It was obviously thrown together quickly. It's disappointing in comparison to 40oz, but has some really good stuff on it. ""Greatest Hits"" is awesome, ""Saw Red"" has Gwen Stefani!"
4,Next Step Up,"My Milwaukee hammer-drill was fine for green concrete and concrete block, but I had to get something less frustrating when I had to drill granite fieldstone. I got fed up with the Jacobs chuck loosening even when I tightened it with 10"" visegrips locked on the chuck key. I ran down to Home Depot to get this, and I must say it was a big improvement if only for the SDS+ chuck. The SDS+ bits cost more but they seem to be better made. Also the rotary hammer puts more impact force into the bit. This model of the Hitachi has only drill and hammer-drill; no chipping mode. Despite the rating of 15/16"", the maximum hole is less than 1/2"" in hardened concrete or granite. Otherwise, it does as good of a job as any of the other brands and costs less. I have some jobs coming up that will require a bigger beast, and I plan to get one of the spline-drive big Hitachis for that."
4,This rotary hammer performs well and is priced right.,We currently own 12 Hitachi rotary hammers and have been very pleased with them. We have tried all other brands and we now choose Hitachi exclusively.We really like the price /performance of the DH38YE and the DH24PB.
5,"Josie And The Pussycats, is LIKE, the BOMB !!! (*not*)","O - kay ... now that I have you all thoroughly *confused* by my Review Title [ is he endorsing the movie, or is he panning it ? ], I can specify: YES, I am Praising & Endorsing ""Josie And The Pussycats"" -- renting it and watching it with my Sister and her Daughter ( not to mention her two in-rapt-attention Sons ) was as much a delight and a Happy Time Trip to the early 70's ( egad, AM I _that_ old now ? ) for my Sis' as for me !! Oh yeah ... and just to _show_ you I'm a Good Old Dude with at the least, a Youthful Spirit, I recently bought the DVD !! Like, Grody to the Max !! And a *very* hip Father/Mother - Daughter // Boyfriend/Girlfriend film to take in together, may I add. Oh, I won't Spoiler the Fun for you ... lemme just say that Soup Du Jour turns sour in the baddies stomach at the end !! Now, sing along w/ me ... ""Jo-see an' da pussy katz ... <S>"
5,Wonderful,"This movie is wonderful. Its filled with laughs that the whole family can enjoy. Teen Pop is exploded in this movie, while subliminal messages are for the adult viewer. My friend and I live off this movie. It has everything a good movie should have, Romance, Friendship, great storyline, and a great soundtrack. I would definately recomend this movie to views of all ages."
1,The Most Cheesiest Film Ever......!,"If this is what one calls ""American Youth Culture"", then let me say, for crying out loud...""Give Us All A Break""! The movie is nothing but an egotistical trip of a ...girlie rock band, trying to find its way in the typical corporate mainstream. I have to be honest, Hollywood media is so much based today on mainstream ..., that they tend to ignore the actual ""American Youth Culture"", that today is in fact leading towards the underground ""DANCE SCENE"". I really had admired movies like ""Groove"" and ""Trainspotting"" which truly reflected that particular club culture...which I guess will take years to finally hit the Hollywoood mainstream, which is so much obsessed with reflecting of what's ""In"" in terms of MTV, and the top 40's...."
1,don't buy this!,"My daughter has an old cartoon ""Josie and the Pussycats"" video from years ago which she likes to watch. So when she wanted to buy this DVD with her Amazon credit, I said ""sure."" I am sorry I did. The characters are evil and nasty. One character in particular uses an excessive amount of bad language to get her point across. The story line is completely vapid. This was a waste of money and I've hidden it so my daughter can't watch it again."
2,overly hyped and majorly dissapointing,"This movie was played up to be the best movie for teenage girls ever but doesn't live up to that title! THe parts with boy band DuJour were the best parts in the movie. The Pussycats however are incredibly boring. Even if you are not watching closely you will see the blatant advertising throughout the whole movie. Brand names and company's are seen throughout the movie! The storyline wasn't exactly very exciting either. Most 11 year old girls will enjoy it but if you don't fit in that category, watch out the pussycats might scratch!"
1,what a waste of time,"Oh, man. The only good thing in this movie was the mock boy-band 'Du Jour' at the start, because it included Seth Green, Breckin Meyer and Donald Adeosun Faison - and they were uncredited parts.OK, so maybe little kids can like this movie (the bright colours! girls in a rock band!) ...but for anyone over the age of 10? The characters had zero personality, the plot was completely predictable, the 'baddies' weren't threatening, it wasn't funny, and the music was terrible. Boring. Four thumbs down."
1,terrible,"it was a shame and a disgrace that such wonderful actresses had to take place in such a hideoius affair. i mean carson and tara made a super cute couple, but i'm most likely not right but if i were carson i would leave tara for this movie. (no offence on anyones behalf-i love all of them."
3,An okay movie...,This was an okay movie. It had it's funny parts.This movie is about 3 girls who are in a band The Pussycats. When they are walking a across the street a guy sees them and thinks he can make them into the next big thing.
3,Cool Movie... 3.5 stars,"This was a good movie. ok, maybe it was a bit stupid, but the casting was well done. the movie had its funny moments. but really, you wonder how much the companies did pay to advertise in the movie.. i know the storyline was about subliminal messages and ad's to buy things, but otherwise the move realy was one really big ad for all major companies such as coca cola and mcdonalds. I think Tara Reid is cool and played melody well. Same goes for Rosario Dawson and Rachel Leigh Cook. One thing they did wrong was the lip syncing wasn't very good. all that aside, it was an ok movie."
4,JOSIE provides top-notch satirical laughs,"Despite being based on a rather tame Archie comic and Hanna-Barbara cartoon, JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS is awash with sharp, silly and satirical humor that keeps tickling your funny-bone from start to finish. From its takeoff of boy-bands, to the running gag of endless product placements, this flick had me smiling from start to finish. Rachael Leigh Cook is solid as Josie, while Tara Reid is totally endearing as the dim, but not dumb, blonde Melody. Alan Cummings and Parker Posey are a hoot as the evil music executives who use the band to plant subliminal messages in their teenage fans' brains. When this movie first came out, many critics were not kind to this flick. Frankly, I think they missed the point. JOSIE is a spot-on spoof of today's music business that truly amuses. Highly recommended."
2,Josie and the Pussycats,"Josie and the Pussycats was a cute film. That's about all I can say. There wasn't really a plot, which is fine, because half the people that see this movie will probably be 13 year old girls. The acting was good and points, and REALLY tired in others. Some moments are funny, but others seem to fail to capture the fun and imagination that the cartoon had.The film follows three singer/songwriters who happen to dress like cats. They hit it big, and have to adjust to their new surroundings. I think I summorized in 2 sentenses what took about and hour and a half to explain in the movie( that should say something).One of the reasons I found the movie to be stupid, was because they were going against what they were preaching. They try to fight against commercialization, yet the movie is a walking promo for Target, Ray Ban, and other major companies.Parents rent this for your kids, but take my advice and leave the room while they are watching it."
1,Very bad.,"The only reason to watch this movie is that there are cute girls in it. If you like it for any reason other than that, you are stupid."
4,The Pussycats Rock!,"As a fan of the Archie comics, I had to see this movie when it came out. It's a great movie to watch with your girlfriends. The story is about three small-town girls from Riverdale USA who have their own band and a manager. One day they get ""discovered"" and sign a recording contract. Along the way to fame and fortune, they discover they are being used to sell products via subliminal messages in their music. The record exes are really out-there, as are some of the other minor characters, but Josie, Melody and Valerie remain true to the original Archie characters. Alan M and the Cabots are even featured.I love the Josie and the Pussycats songs (though the DeJour songs could use some work). I even have the soundtrack."
4,"OK, I admit it, I like this movie!","4 of 5 stars for the comic turned movie Josie and the Pussycats. Yes, I admit it, I like this movie. Yes, I should seek professional help. This is a cute, dumb and funny movie. Take three girls (all pretty, 2/3s dumb) who form a rock band. Add a manager and record company out to control the minds of everyone in the world. Lots of great visuals, glitsy, flashy and just plain fun things (inside their plane is covered with sponsor ads). It is just plain fun. Shout-out to Tara Reid who takes the role of ""dumb blonde"" to new levels. Rosario Dawson plays the one pussycat with a brain. While Parker Posey plays Josie. I do recommend this movie; it is OK for the whole family. Its just fun and entertaining. Please pass the popcorn."
4,Rockin,When this originally came out it rubbed alot of industry people the wrong way and did not get great reviews but watching it now -- it seems more applicable to the state of society. It's campy and fun to watch. The dialogue is not shakespear but it's not meant to be. It's a great escape and really makes you think about what and why things influence us.
4,Embarassed to love it..,"It's not Citizen Kane, folks.But's it's entertaining as hell and made us 20-somethings laugh our head off without the aid of chemicals. Once it's on cable, it'll be another ""Clueless"" -- a film you won't admit to liking in public and yet stop to watch at least 15 minutes of it when your flipping channels.The music is addictive (although the band starts out grrl-pop-punk and by the last musical number has slammed head first into typical teenage pap love ballad), the plot is painfully expected, but it shamelessly rips on its target market - consumerist pre-teen girls dropping disposable cash into the...money making machine.I eagerly await its rental release, just so I can force all my friends who didn't see it in theaters to watch the ""Du Jour"" section of the film."
1,Wow,"My review is simple and to the point. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What ever happened to the great movies of the past? When stories were great and you actually cared to finish a movie...........I guess this movie proves how far we have declined in what is considered ""popular"" culture."
2,"Better than I thought, but still bad","Before watching this, I was sure it was going to be bad from start to finish. And, I was basically right but it did have some funny moments.Yes, the acting was bad, the music was bad, and the product placement was obnoxious even though it was supposed to be part of the storyline.Yes, it did bomb at the box office and deservingly so but if it comes on TV, then sure, go ahead and watch it.I was mildly disappointed that the girls weren't wearing those cat costumes from the cartoon upon which this movie is based. They were so cute in those costumes in the cartoon and my brother and I were very excited about that when we were young.[...]"
1,What Can You Expect?,"Well, I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, which is udnerstandable considereing the pathetic plot. I left wondering why I'd even wasted my time on this piece of garbage. 'Josie and the Pussycats' resembles the Spice Girls music flick with a similar plot 'Spiceworld'. Both movies are dumb, dim-witted, badly acted, and follow a weak script. It's a shame, Rachel Leigh-Cook, Tara Reid, and Alan Cummings are fantastic actors. They should be embarassed to have appeared in something like this!'Josie and the Pussycats' is obviously geared towards younger kids, so maybe I wasn't suppposed to like it, but I at leats should have enjoyed SOME of it! My eight year old sister and her friends love this movie, so I recommend it for anyone under the age of nine years. I'm a movie lover, so it's hard for me to truly dislike a movie. Now it's saying something when I say that I hated this movie! The one star is for the great music! Too bad it was wasted on a movie ...[like] this."
5,Blank the critics,"Contrary to what I heard some critics say, I thought this was a great movie. It delivered an important message without getting so deep that it stopped being a comedy. Not to quote Brenden Frasier, but we have guys up in the offices running the industry and they don't know a ... thing about rock & role. This movie attached this real problem without really attaching it.To many discisions are made by the pocket books of executives, and not enough by the talent. But if they get out of line, ... (a slight strech but after all, this is a comidy.)This is a cute movie, and I'm glad I bought it."
4,Let the teenager in you come out and watch this movie!!,"... I thought that this movie was very cute and had a very laughable plot. The only thing that I don't care about in this film is the ending. What a cop-out! But nevertheless, don't take it seriously...it's based on a 60's girly comic book... ! Sit back and laugh as Tara Ried plays the ditzy, but lovable ""Melody"" as if she was born for the part!"
3,Not so purrrrific!,"I enjoyed the acting. But overall the movie was stupid. I would of prefured the cartoon over the movie. It did have its funny moments. I would say little girls will love it. Teens could go eaither way. adults will hate it or think its cute. Wait for video for this one. I had seen so much promotion for it in magazines, tv, and radio and went to see it thinking about how great it was going to be. I ended up comeing out disapointed!"
3,"Fun Movie, but not the best","I was so happy when I heard about this movie. I bought the soundtrack right away b/c Kay Hanley Of Letters To Cleo did the singing and I am a big fan of hers, but the movie in general could have been better. I thought it was a very fun movie to rent and I enjoyed it. I thought the movie was going to be mainly about the band, but it turned mostly to be about the record company and that disappointed me. I also think they could have given more credit to Kay Hanley for her amazing vocals!"
1,A genuine bomb,"Rachel Leigh Cook is rather charming as Josie and Alan Cumming does a good job with a similar role to one he played in Spy Kids. But others, like a bedraggled looking Tara Reid, don't improve what is already a scattershot film with sloppy writing and choppy direction. The notion that Americans are jumping around from one to another (""orange is the new pink"") has been done much better before. The only inspired part of the film involves the opening with the boy band DuJour, which ends all too soon.The movie also has so many product placements it is distracting. The filmmakers apparently are trying to make this seem funny. But it's just like a huge shameful commercial. Acutally commercials usually show more cleverness than this film.I guess 12 year old girls may like this film. But I doubt anyone else will."
2,Josie and the Pussycats -- What were they thinking...,"Just what were they thinking when they made this movie? I rented this movie because a liked the 70's cartoon ""Josie and the Pusycats.""After viewing this film I was left thinking... What were they thinking!?! The highest rating I dare give this film is 2 stars.""Josie and the Pussycats"" is one BIG ad for fast food chains, shopping malls, and music stores. Though the casting for the 'band"", ""Josie and the Pussycats"" was well done. The movie itself had no real plot. The villians were cheesy.This comic/cartoon should have never made it to the big screen.If what this movie was looking for was laughs, I didn't find any. At times the satire was amusing but not funny.If I were you, I'd pass on this one. You're not missing anything special."
3,reminds me of those not really movies by the olsen twins,"I bought this yesterday, expecting it to be a great movie, packed with great music and a great cast. I got something that I hate getting, a movie that turns out to be one of those not so appealing ones, the kind you get from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. I like their movies but it's the kind that they usually stop in the middle and explain to us because the movie isn't all that great. Cheap entertainment. I got the same thing from this. It's a good movie, a lot of surprises, but overall, not all that great. Spend your money on a movie you know will be good, this one just isn't worth it."
3,"Funny, but no plot.","In this movie, there are a lot of little jokes but it has a really retarded plot. I mean, it was really funny and had GREAT music but the plot of the movie was a little sappy, I mean lets take over the world with music. Come on."
4,Cute and fun,"This movie is not exactly like the original media for Josie and the Pussycats - it has been significantly updated to fit the year that this movie was produced in. The story is almost like a spoof/parody of advertising, fashion, the music industry, pop culture etc, especially with the villains of this film.If you're looking for a movie that is completely faithful to the original, you will be disappointed. But movie adaptations are never exactly the same as their source, and some adaptations have been very good. This is one of them - it has its laugh-out-loud moments, along with some cheesy and dramatic moments to make for a nice, fun, light (but not too light) flick."
5,Josie and the Pussycats is the movie of the century!,"If you want to have a good laugh at a movie, buy this movie!! It is the best movie of the century! This movie is full of funny, cute friendship. I'd call it a girl movie, but boys would like it too! Josie and her pals are great friends, and it has the best music ever! So i'll say those ""3 small words"" The Pussycats rock!"
5,Awesome!,"Okay, I am a boy. Why did I tell you that? Because this may seem like a girl movie but I loved it! Tara Reid, Rosario Dawson and especially Rachel Leight Cook make this movie awesome and hirlarious! You have to see it. A little bit of swearing, but other than that it's great!"
4,Wait 4 it,"I'm a skeptic, when someone says anything I have to wait to see if the ""saying match the doing and the time it takes to be done""...well they delivered as promised and I have no compliants...Thanks Guys"
5,Incredible,"The plush pug just came in today. It is a little smaller than I expected but it certainly makes up for it with the quality and detail it was made with. Though not easily visible in the picture, it's sad puppy dog eyes are well portrayed and it is just as wrinkly and adorable as the real thing. All around a great buy."
2,Not at all as cute as reviews would lead one 2 believe!!,"The dog,Pug is just ok in my opinion. his eyes are very sticky, and cloudy, and scratched up.. Not sure why he arrived this way isn't this a new item?, not used? Appears used..,if it's used it should be stated so in the description!!!"
5,Well-loved Pug,"My son got this puppy dog for his first birthday and LOVES it. He carries it around with him everywhere, hugs it, pets it, and sleeps with it every night. It has held up to the every day abuse of a toddler and still looks brand new. One of the ears has come unsewn, but does not affect the overall aesthetic of the dog. I have had to wash the dog (on delicate and let air dry) and once dried the dog looked as good as new. We have had to buy a second one to have on hand in case our son loses his. I think it is one of the best looking Pug plush animals I've seen and is very cute! I would highly recommend this plush Pug pup and you can't beat the price!"
5,Great toy for my pug!,Length:: 0:44 MinsHere is my pug Kira with her favorite toy. She loves the aurora pug! She plays with it 2 to 3 hours a day. Most stuff animals that she had would be torn up in less than a week. The aurora pug has lasted over 2 months so far and there is no rips or damage other than drooling. Big thumbs up for durability!
5,Beautiful,It looks soooo lifelike i cant even describe it. i got it for my mom and she loves it! very high quality and well made!
5,Fantastic collecion for Shelley enthusiasts,"This is a comprehensive collection of Shelley's works including plays, poems and other works. Recommend for the Shelley enthusiast, casual Shelley fan and anyone majoring in English (BA, MA, PhD...) very useful resource for myself, classmates and my professors (I am an English MA student myself.) Includes both well known works (Promethius Unbound, Ozymandias etc etc..) as well as some perhaps lesser known works (Mask of Anarchy...)Very nice collection for any personal library, especially for the price."
5,Amazing,"This is an amazing CD. I especially like the Muczynski Concerto and Suite. They are great pieces, and the pianist is amazing--spectacular technique and artistry."
2,"Solid feeling dj-style phones, sound quality needs improvement","I bought these bluetooth headphones to serve as a wireless method of me to listen to stereo music from my laptop or smartphone. The fit and finish of these phones is fairly nice, and the battery life is measured to be in the ""weeks"" range.The real probably is with sound quality. In my pair, I get an odd ghosting o f the signal of interest at a higher, harsher frequency. The phones are not entirely unusable, but can be fatiguing and obviously do not do a sound reproduction job that I'd expect from them"
2,Just not good enough...,"I had high hopes for these headphones. On top of that, I'm a bit of an audiophile and, as a musician and DJ, demand excellent sound quality from speakers and headphones.Perhaps that's why I was so disappointed when I heard these headphones. Although the idea of Bluetooth is, in theory, a step up from the lesser quality of the FM wireless headphones of the past, it quite simply does not allow the capture of the lows and mids of quality, wired versions.The S805 are bulky, clunky and the sound quality was fine for the casual gamer or someone wishing to listen to their Bluetooth collection on a Smartphone, but for a serious lover of music, they're just not good enough."
4,Versitle Backpack for the Professional,"I have been using this laptop for over a month now and am very pleased. I use if to carry my laptop, converter, papers, etc., each day to work and it is comfortable hanging over one shoulder or on my back. On a few business trips, the backpack has proved sturdy and comfortable when loaded up with additional materials. The picture depicts the backpack as purple or blue but the black color is even and professional. I would recommend the pack for professionals who are looking for an alternative way to carry your work home each night."
1,I sure hope the book is better...,"I've never read Earthsea. So I probably fit in the category the producers of this sorry oevre had in mind. But all this affection for the book couldn't possibly have been meant for a story so shallow, so small, so predictable and boring as this movie. Sorry, producers, after Lord of the Rings we are just not gonna take cheap adaptions any more! And it's not just a question of money and special effects. It's a question of acting, of writing, of true spirit. All sorely lacking here."
4,Earthsea,I have read the original books this DVD is based on and I enjoyed them. I watched the DVD with some trepidation after reading some of the reviews - I was not quite sure what I was going to see. Having seen the DVD I can say I really enjoyed it and my family did too. OK it is only loosely based on the books but it is still a good yarn and I think the makers have done a very good job. I think Earthsea deserves a chance - watch it and be pleasantly surprised.
2,Passable,"Although passable this movie falls far short from the potential it's plotline held. While the effects were nicely done and the magic smoothly incorporated the real flaw in EARTHSEA was the dialogue and acting.Shawn Ashmore, while not what you would call a 'bad actor' most definately needs supporting cast, we've seem him in several films (X-men notably) but he needs help. He had none. The rest of the cast was a jumble of men and women who either stumbled over their lines or overdid in moments that were laughable.EARTHSEA's plot had a lot of promise, the books were decently done and well worth the read, but this movie... well it definately falls short of what it should have been. The character's weren't correctly cast and the script was poorly thought out. I blame this on the director and as such I have to rate two starts however much I wish I could give more."
3,Earthea - live action,"First off - the movie itself:NEGATIVE: The story seems to be significantly abriviated from the books (I have not read them as of now) since the character development is fairly weak at the beggining. Acting by the lead and supporting leads begins poorly but improves with the movie progression (possibly shot chronologically??). The script could have been better written.POSITIVE: the movie is fairly clean - 1 bedroom scene that can be skipped with no detrement to plot develpoment. 3-5 scary parts (depends on child's age - there is supposed to be a ""demon"" and the face is gruesome- shown 3-4 times. Also when the ""demon"" is relased it attacks Jed - scary also). minimal languageSummary: entertaining, though I think i would rather buy the soundtrack (HAS AMAZING MUSIC) and read the books."
1,"Once again ""they"" messed it up.","Earthsea could have been great, if the producers/director/writers had just read the books. This movie was doomed from the first five mintues. If you've never read the books, read them and then never watch this movie, that's my advice to you."
1,Complete Bastardization,"First off, I'd like to say that I have no disrespect for the actors in the mini-series. Many are good actors in their own right, but weren't right for the parts.With that said, I ask anyone and everyone looking to watch this mini-series to steer clear of it... very clear of it. Go straight for the books. Personally, I got in to Earthsea by watching the mini-series... enjoying it... not knowing what had been done to it. After reading the first book, I can honestly say that what has been done is wrong. Visit the author's site for more info: www.ursulakleguin.com. The changes are not simple changes to make it better suited for a film version. They are very large changes that change the entire story.Please read the books first. If you must, come back and watch the mini-series.. but not the mini-series first. The first book, A Wizard of Earthsea, is amazing. I begin on The Tombs of Atuan tonight."
2,At least it served to prompt me to get the books,"Having not read any of the Earthsea books, I watched this mini series with a modicum of objectivity that cannot be found in the folks that had previously read the series. The show was honestly nothing special and while mildy entertaining, could not be considered ""good"". For a lazy evening of TV, you could do worse. The one act of goodness that came from my viewing is that I purchased the Wizard of Earthsea to pass the time on a plane flight and after reading both that and the Tombs of Atuan, I realized what an injustice the movie had done to the books. Though many events are there, the plot is significantly different. I can understand how they tried to ""Spice things up"" for TV, but in this effort they failed by butchering many of the things that made the story deeply compelling. If you have read the books, be prepared for a different experience."
3,In Terms of the story,"This miniseries was all right in its special effects. The story line was a little screwed up by the way that the use/secret names were switched and how the people weren't as noticeably different as LeGuin stated in her books. It give information on what was going on, which is helpful if you haven't read the books, and it did produce Ged's life fairly accurately. The shadow that follows him is very well done. This is a nice miniseries, but die-hard fans, BEWARE!"
3,Wizard of Earthsea,"I teach a ninth grade English class and assigned the novel THE WIZARD OF EARTHSEA. The film actually takes up two of the authors novels so was a little confusing to students but we managed to muddle through and hopefully encouraged several to read the next novel due to the film. The special effects are interesting, the acting a little slow. Not bad to give a visual for kids."
2,"Differences between Earthsea, the trilogy, and Earthsea, the movie, are too jarring...","So I watched this movie, and it didn't make a lot of sense. Then I readThe Earthsea Trilogy, by Ursula K. Le Guin. Then I watched this movie again.Oh, brother!This movie has just enough of the elements of the Earthsea story by Le Guin to be familiar, but enough differences to be jarring. And don't get me started about the acting (or lack thereof), the fake sailing, the mixing of storylines, and even the juxtaposition of the names of Sparrowhawk/Ged.I wonder how many Earthsea fans watched this show with growing horror as the story progressed. I can just picture all the ""What the...!!?"" comments.You won't be taking this one as your one movie for the year on an island!"
1,WORTHLESS,"This is the worst adaptation of a book to film that I have ever seen. it is as if the creators of the film never read the book and, judging it simply by the cover art, set out to make a film that would cause people to hate it. It is so bad, if you sit in on the shelf next to other films it will make them crappier as well. I feel sorry for the actors who had to muddle through this chancre and I feel awful for ANYONE who sees it and thinks it has anything to do with Ms. LeGuin's fantastic work.There is nothing worth recommending here. Not one thing. It betrays everything the original writer created with her stellar and beautiful series of books. Ignore this film. Ignore it with an ax, repeatedly, until it's not a film anymore. Then go and read the books or listen to the radio adaptation on BBC 7.This thing is just worthless. Completely worthless.I would have given it a negative number rating but AMAZON doesn't allow that."
2,Disappointing...,"I had hoped for a good fantasy, but was seriously disappointed. The movie was low budget and even Danny Glover couldn't salvage that. The book may have been great, but if so, the movie certainly did not do it justice."
1,"oh boy, did I get het up!!!","No stars are not an option, so I'll use 1If you haven't read LeGuin, go ahead and watch this. I do ask that you please make time to read the books at some point (if you don't have time to read, there are very good unabridged audio recordings of LeGuin's stories).If you have read LeGuin, please learn from my mistake and AVOID this."
1,Badly acted,"I guess the thing that leaps out at one more than anything else is the absolutely horrible acting that characterizes the majority of this prodcution. The females have an edge over the males in that regard, with Kristin Kreuk being probably the highlight. But even her participation does not make this worth watching. This needs to be re-written, re-cast, re-produced --in fact, made from scratch with this version serving only as a handy compendium of putrid mistakes."
1,Why?? Please oh holy gods why?,"I love movies. I am addicted to movies. I literally see over 50 per year at the cinemas. This movie blows. This is just a jumbled up version of three books that makes no sense. Sci-Fi has made some great mini-series, like Dune, but this one fell out of the short bus and rode the tail pipe all the way. Just pass on this movie. Do read the books."
1,Hideous betrayal of author's work,"Watching as much of this awful travesty as I did made me feel as though I was being pissed on from a great height. The makers of this garbage savaged Leguin's beautiful, moving work, treating it as so much turtle dung. Having read and re-read the Earthsea books for three decades, I was nauseated and outraged by this mulch.The single star is not deserved, just chosen in order to post the review. Earthsea rates nothing more than a sneer."
2,Is this actually Earthsea?,"I was incredibly disappointed with this film. After reading all the Earthsea books, I was appalled at how much the movie DIDN'T follow the books it was based on.The special effects in this movie were just awful. Poorly done 3D graphics, as well as over used smoke machines and badly done blue screens. There was very little effort, or so it seems, put into creating realistic effects.The acting was absolutely abysmal. I will admit that Shawn Ashmore, and Kristen Kreuk were the best actors, but they are FAR above this type of cheap, cheesy film. I also enjoyed Chris Gauthier as Vetch. But the rest of the acting was overdone, cheesy, and just plain awful.I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has actually read the books. Instead, watch the 10th Kingdom. Very enjoyable film. Unlike this bit of trash."
3,New more positive look at this,"I must admit that I had not read any of the Earthsea stories until after I saw the SciFi Channel's version last December. When I did read, The Wizard of Earthsea, I did see that were many differences because I found that the mini series was based on two of the stories. I still need to read the second book which I only just obtained recently. Still I think the mini series was not bad and needs some further scrutiny before a final decision is made. Too often I have met people who pass negative judgement on a film because it didn't follow the story close enoungh for thier liking despite how well it was made. This is apparently one of those films. Any way I do feel, The Legend of Earthsea, is a good thing to watch and be given a second chance, even by the hardline fans."
3,Not Too Bad,"Could be better, could be worse. Not bad for a made for TV movie. If you like SciFi you will like it."
1,Are you kidding me?,Did the film makers even read the Earthsea books? I really had my hopes up because of the SciFi Channel Dune movies. This movie was pure torture. Even Ursella LeGuin disowned it after she saw what her story had become.
1,Movie sucks,"This doesn't come close to the books - it's infuriatingly inaccurate, reducing interesting fiction to hackneyed drivel. Badly written, badly acted, badly directed, badly edited.We wonder if the writers ever actually read the books - or can read at all."
3,"Yes, it was a hack job, BUT...","I am a true fan of the Le Guin books, and I watched the mini-series with something like nausea in sympathy for the hatchet job on the wondrous Earthsea books. That said, however, I found the mini-series, for the TV dumbed-down pablum that it was, was passable, just the Mists of Avalon copy someone else likened it to. It was brain candy and it didn't pretend to be anything else. Now, if someone were to remake it in a true image of the books, that would be wondrous... Still, it had decent special effects, decent acting, the hack job on the story line actually worked and tied the strange changes to the original story lines together logically and well, and gave the tale a satisfying ending. What you ended up with was NOT the Earthsea we all know and love from Ms. LeGuin's books, but it wasn't all that bad, for what it was!"
1,Throw it away!,"If you don't know the books or have no knowledge of the depths of LeGuin's writing style, then go ahead and watch this. Perhaps you'll enjoy and be turned on to read the books which are far superior.For everyone else, throw it away! I was so excited when I first found out that Earthsea was going to be a mini-series and anticipated watching it. Then, I watched it! Simply wretching! Fully understanding why LeGuin disassociated herself from this production and it is pitiful that she was not consulted becuase with her assistance I do believe the production could have been much better since the visual effects and set were not all that atrocious. The storyline, the vocabulary, the general charater interaction - beyond sub par. I have been a fan of LeGuin's writing for many years and was utterly devestated how this seemingly good idea became botched trash."
3,"Good movie, mediocre adaptation","All right, yes, I have read the books, and yes, they are an underappreciated work of art that should be right up there in popularity with Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. That said, as an adaptation of the book, the Sci-Fi channel miniseries seems to have stripped down the plot a little too much--the meaning and diversity of Ursula K. Le Guin's world have indeed been altered a little too much.But step back for a moment. If the expectations of a critical reader of the books puts aside his ideas of wht Earthsea SHOULD be, then they will probably enjoy the movie, not as an adaptaion of a book, but as a freestanding story of its own a lot more. Take the movie as a movie, and don't compare its plot to the original found in Le Guins trilogy; only then can it truly be appreciated for the entertaining video that it is."
3,Earthsea OK,"I really enjoyed the books years ago ... ""Vincent"" from Eureka gives a great performance, as does Kristin K., but I wasn't overly impressed by the actor playing ""Ged"". Fun to watch, but I am glad I netflixxed it."
1,Earthsea,I would love to be able to review this but since it has not been received yet (ordered 10/01/07 and today is 11/02/07) I can not. I look forward to be able to do so hopefully before Christmas 2007.
1,"Horrible: horrible, horrible...","If it were physically possible to make a *worse* adaptation of Ursula K. LeGuin's award-winning EarthSea series, I'm sure SciFi would have tried. The actors, all talented, make the best of their material but there's not much there to work with. The mistakes, the bloopers, the incoherent storyline...has Ed Woods been reanimated, and why?"
1,A travesty of the wonderful original,"It's been a while since I read all the 'Earthsea' books but even my imperfect memory could tell me that this was dreadfully wrong. What a pathetic rendering of a marvellous tale. Without Le Guin's wonderful language, a TV adaptation was always going to be risky, but this just fell flat on its face. My teenage son wandered in, looked, laughed, and went out. I just sat and watched in anguish. Who, having seen that and not knowing the original, is going to go out and read the books?But that's what everyone must do - read the books and let your mind supply the visuals."
1,terribly disappointing,"This movie should not even have Earthsea in the title. It is an absolute insult to both Ursula K. LeGuin and her readers. This movie has terrible casting, bad acting, no adherence to the plot or even the most basic of concepts from the books.Do yourself a favor and don't even bother.Shame on you sci-fi channel."
1,Don't waste your money,"Weak storyline, mostly due to the fact that they butchered the plot of the original books. The books do not follow a typical Hollywood storyline, as they lack a specific villain or a romance. So, the producers of this mini-series decided to add those elements, plus a battle scene. The special effects were ok, but the dialogue is just bad and the characters are whiny and uninteresting.Bottom line: go see Harry Potter, or LOTR again. You aren't missing much by skipping this miniseries."
3,"A coming-of-age story based on a great novel, but got the Hallmark treatment.","Based on a novel by Ursula K/ La Guin, this is one of those fantasy stories with wizards, High Priestess', evil doers and magic. A young up-and-coming wizard, Ged (Shawn Ashmore) and an occasional buddy is tasked with saving their world ""Earthsea"" from recent bad buys and old evil ones. Meanwhile back at the temple a sister Kossil (Jennifer Calvert) with a nasty attitude and a vile of poison is trying to usurp the High priestess position from Thar (Isabella Rossellini). Will the wizard succeed in his mission? Will the slinky sister fulfill her mission?Well costumed, fair graphics, contemporary dialog.Before watching this story you may want to read some of Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces""And if you are a fan of Isabella Rossellini, she has a great series of shorts called ""Green Porn"" It's all about bugs, fish, and other such creatures.The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Bollingen Series)"
1,The antithesis of LeGuin's series,"Whoever adapted this tale to the screen completely missed the points Ursula K. LeGuin made in her series. The diversity of the races and cultures in Earthsea has been stripped away, and we are left with the whitebread version. Tenar's order has been transformed from an evil cult offering human sacrifices to false gods to a group of religious who are holding back the tide of evil by virtue of their faith. The only good thing I can say about the series (aside from the music) is that it made me go back and read the books again, to make sure I wasn't completely misremembering them."
1,A disappointing film,"A lover of Earthsea for many years, I and my high school fantasy class students eagerly awaited the debut of this film on SciFi Channel. We were all disappointed. The filmmakers made too many bad choices and strayed too far from what made LeGuin's novel excellent. From casting a white Ged and characterizing Vetch as a clueless slob of a sidekick to complete inventions like the invasion of Roke-it's painful to watch. LeGuin herself apologized to her fans for the film. Occasionally, the makers get things right: Earthsea is beautiful and some scenes are good like when Ogion sees Ged as a bird and declares ""I named you."" These only serve as painful reminders of what could have been. I purchased the movie large to share clips with future students so that they could see more clearly what they have come to love about Earthsea through its absence in the film."
2,very very very very very loosely based on Ursula K. Le Guin's trilogy,"Guess I have come to expect more from the Sci Fi Channel.....(well except for that Children of Dune thing)The movie is hardly recognizable as being based on the first two books of the trilogy(if the third is in there I missed it) The Tombs of Atuan is not even closely related to the story and I really can't figure out why...it was a great book, my favorite of the four in the series.Changing it did nothing for the plot whatsoever....The special effects are ok, the dragon is kind of cool, but if you are an Earthsea fan, expect a very different story."
2,Unwatchable,"After the moderate success of Sci-Fi's Dune (and subsequentially, Children of Dune) mini-series, Legend of EarthSea looked like it had promise. The production values were high, and the commercials promised a somewhat unique setting. That, unfortunately, turned out to be the furthest thing from the truth.Legend of EarthSea is little more than a pile of tired fantasy clichés, polished up by the decent production values. It wasn't enough to keep me interested, however. Every time a character began to talk, I cringed. There were several characters whose sole purpose was to provide needless, boring exposition.I'm sincerely convinced that Sci-Fi has fallen into the habit of hiring failed, hack fantasy authors to pen each new ""original"" series. I guess it accomplishes the task of increasing their profit margin, but it's gotten to the point where I'll only tune in to watch re-runs of older, far better shows like FarScape."
1,A Crime against literature,"The DVD rendering of the ""earthsea"" series is far worse than the unjustified change to the ""Lord of the Rings"" by Peter Jackson. Why does the movie industry think that the only way to convert great books to the screen is to rob them of all depth and meaning?"
3,disappointing,"In DUST OF EDEN, an old woman discovers a jar of dust that has the gift of life, and she uses it to control those around her. This soon causes problems when others gradually begin to realize her secret.This novel was something of a disappointment, as good as the writing is. Though it does generate a good amount of suspense and shock, I expected something a little more philosophical from this Pulitzer prize-winning author than this glorified Twilight Zone episode. Instead of dealing with the issue of the soul or what the afterlife is like (which this novel clumsily sidesteps), it degenerates into a battle of wills between people over the dust. The middle part, especially, lacks credibility, and the ending leaves some plot threads hanging (what happened to the spiders?). A big disappontment, but decent entertainment, nevertheless."
4,Very educational without being boring!,"While this book is probably not for the casual reader, anyone with a keen interest in Dante and/or British Romantic poets should read this book!"
4,FAROUT DUDE,My husband liked this movie so much we had to watch it again. IT WAS FAR OUT!! We will probably watch it again in the near future. It was hilarious for the most part.
3,Pretty but high maintenance,"The pole on this holder has to be tightened every other day. Not sure if it's defective or just the design. It looks great on my countertop, but I hate the ""wobbling"" when I use it."
4,Evco White Marble Collection Paper Towel Holder,Quality overall is good. It was a little smaller in size than we expected. It has a nice appearance and will do the job.
3,Hair falls really easy,"It is nice. however hair feels very cheap and falls very easy at touch.If you buy this, consider that is not to be handled and use only as decoration"
4,Stuffed Dog,Puchased this as part of a halloween costume. Went as a show dog handler--this little guy definitely did the trick. Realistic enough it fooled one of the guests into thinking I had brought one of my real dogs. Lots of fun.
5,pomeranian Aurora,"This was such a cute and most real life looking pomeranian plush that I have ever purchased. I had to buy more for all my dog show buddies. some of us used it as a ""how to trim your Pom"" and some of us just love it as it was and ofcourse some of us had to have more than 1"
5,Cute Stuffed Animal / Great Price,I bought this for my daughter after we saw it in a high end shop for a lot more money.The Pamy is soft and cuddly!
3,Good Product but...,"The planer/joiner table that I received did not look like the picture shown by Amazon but was equal in design and use so worked OK. The mounting holes did not match the Makita Planer that I bought to go on the table, so I had to drill new holes and purchase longer mounting bolts, but now that it is all assembled it makes a great combination."
1,DON'T BUY ANY RITEK RIDATA 8x MEDIA!!!!!!,DON'T BUY ANY RITEK RIDATA 8x MEDIA!!!!!!They become unplayable after a few months. Do a google search for Ritek 8x problems and you will get to the online forums where this problem has been discussed.I just threw away a hundred discs that I burned less than 8 months ago!!!
5,Would not stray from this brand again.,I first purchased these in the 25 pack spindle when I first used my generic brand DVD burner. After 25 successful burns I went cheap and tried the Velocity equivalent. Never again! 9 out of 10 burns were coasters. I bought the Ridata 50 pack and after another 20 or so discs - not one bad disc. Lesson learned.
5,Just finished my 100 dvd+r spindle and they rock!,"This media is amazing for burning. Not only will you get very little coasters, you can go back to your dvd+rs a long time after burning and have them work perfectly, even if scratched.I'm using a TS-H552b dvd burner which we all know can be quite picky about it's media, and this passes the test 100% everytime.I finished a complete 100 dvd+r from ridata (R003) and I only got one damaged disked out of the entire lot!!!Never buying anything else again."
3,Not 8x on NEC 2100AD,"These will burn at only 4X on an NEC 2100AD with the latest firmware installed in a Dell 8300. However, you can't beat the price."
4,Good but only 4x on HP dvd 420i,"I have burned about 50 of these with no problems at all, but my HP drive only writes to them at 4x using DVD Shrink 3.1. The drive writes to HP 8x DVD+R media at 8x using the same program (gee, what a surprise). If you're an HP user and speed is not a concern, these are fine discs and the price is right."
2,BEWARE: Pioneer 8X drive writes these at 4X,"In addition to the user's review below with a NEC drive, Pioneer is in the same boat...According to Ritek's site, they are working on getting a full 8X out of Pioneer's DVR-107D and DVR-A07XLA, but they are not there yet. I'm disappointed because I didn't consult their site before buying them and expecting to write at 8X with my Pioneer drive.One would easily assume that a DVD writer, with a big fat 8X on the box (running the latest firmware and software), and media with that same fat 8X on the wrapper would be able to write at 8X, but guess what? Not true!"
2,"Poor compatibility, don't waste your money.","Since the price is higher than the average for most DVD+Rs, I bought this item expecting to have better than average compatibility. This was not the case. Even burning at a 2X speed, I was only able to get the discs to play on two out of four players, and one out of three DVD-ROM drives. I see all these 4-5 star reviews, so maybe mine were part of a bad batch, but for now, don't waste your money on Ritek."
2,Actual Write Speed,"I paid the price of 8x speed, but only received 4x burning speed with the latest Nero 6.3.1.15 and the latest CopytoDVD 3.0.20 software. I have a new NEC DVD dual layer burner, model ND-2510A."
3,2414B model,"It is well worth it to by the 2414B(insted of 2414NB) model. It costs a little more and is slightly harder to find, but it is a much better saw. The pivoting head doesn't seem all that wonderfull in theory, but after a few cuts you will love it. The 2414B is a 5 star saw. It puts out plenty of power to make quick cuts, dynamic parts move smoothly, and the blade guard doesn't block the view of you marks. A very well designed machine. However what makes it singular, is the pivoting head."
3,Bad economics of abrasive disc saws,"The metal blade chop saws such as DeWalt's sell for 2x to 2.5x the price of this one. However, they work better, and the blade is much more reliable. This was a bad idea from the outset...soft cutting wheels. I argue they are too quick to fail, possibly even dangerous when they do. This is a saw for light aluminum work or for steel studs for drywall or maybe electrical conduit. Any of those applications would be better served by an investment in a metal blade tool."
1,Not Made in America,"Recently purchased the 2414NB Cut-Off Saw and bought it based on the reviewer from Upland CA (1999) stating it was made in America. I also went to the Makita web site and felt confident the saw was made in America. It is made in China. Was very disappointed. It is now my understanding there isn't a cut-off saw made in America today so will give this saw a fair try. Hopefully the Makita name will keep it together. Will provide an update in a couple months. Respectfully, Larry Butterfield."
5,Fantastic history and adventure!,"Readers will love this story. Author James Poling takes readers along for an exciting ride and a dramatic look into the life of one of the world's greatest sea farers. Priates, privateers, explorers, rogues, and daring adventures await.The author takes great care in placing details and weaving a fine quality fabric in this story. Using dialogue, and jargon, the author takes the reader back to a idyllic time when life's adventures lead to greater adventures.Take the time to read this book if your library still has it. It is wonderful and compelling."
5,We used this book to have a successful retreat at Alliance Redwoods Camp,"This book is probably one of the most comprehensive books that I have seen thoroughly equipped event planners use for their events at Alliance Redwoods in Occidental, California. Planning a retreat is no small feat that is easy for first-timers to underestimate. This book eliminates many potential surprises and stresses of planning a retreat for a large group. I highly recommend a book like this for any first time retreat planner as I have experienced some very wonderful retreats that were planned using this book. If you have ever been stressed out or frustrated planning a large retreat, then you will be pleased to know there is a book that shows a detailed, easy to follow, step by step methodology for planning a surprise-free hassle-free Christian Conference."
1,how can you not stock it?,"If you sell the machine, you have to sell the various grinding wheels. I use my tools for a long time, and can't afford to buy from an company that doesn't care about customer service. I'm going to buy elsewhere until I can get essential parts for a machine I bought only last year."
3,"Strong on overview, philosophy; weak on technique.","While not much of a how-to book, it provides a fine overview of the publishing business, with details on specific editorial positions and what kinds of people will succeed in them. It's also good at describing/prescribing the editor-author relationship: how to write tactful queries, be a friend to authors, and generally get what you want. More of this would have been helpful. The final chapter, on technological advances in publishing, is out of date and mostly pointless.I enjoyed the read, but I could easily have lived without this book. Glad I bought it used; it's not a book to which I will often refer.P.S. One of the ugliest covers I've ever seen. What on earth was Cambridge thinking?"
4,The Mouse on the Mile is wonderful,"Once again, King has created an amazing story with The Green Mile: The Mouse on the Mile, however it did not contain the horror or gore that this reader was expecting. Within this novel King gives a chilling but natural view of prisons during The Great Depression. The interaction of prisoners and guards is explored as well as the procedure of killing a criminal via the electric chair. The friction between prison guards is also seen, as well as the action of nepotism. These factors give The Mouse on the Mile a human and natural feeling. However, with King's reputation, this reader had anticipated to be engrossed in terror. This did not occur, however, but one can expect to see King's trademark horror later in The Green Mile series. All in all, King has still made a wonderful novel, and this reader highly recommends it."
4,Part 2 in The Green Mile Serialization,"Even though ""The Mouse on the Mile"" is an entertaining second addition to The Green Mile serialization, it backtracks a bit in time, before John Coffey came to the E Block. The mouse (Steamboat Willy, later known as Mr. Jingles) is spotlighted a little more, as well the electrocution of one of the inmates, known as The Chief. I didn't mind either topics, but I was more interested in John Coffey's story, since it had just started to unravel in the first book, ""The Two Dead Girls"", then was all but skipped in this one. Great cliffhanger at the end, though, which will make readers eager to read the next book and the next--""Coffey's Hands"" (#3), ""The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix"" (#4), ""Night Journey"" (#5), and ""Coffey on the Mile"" (#6)."
2,I think this book is not werth reading,"Adrian RobinsonThe GreenMile By Stephen King.The green mile is a good book for mature teens and older people.This book is about a couple of night guards in a prison for old people.Who are sentenced to life or death. The characters are Percy Wetmor,and Brad Dorlan. A couple of prisoners are Toot Toot a prisoner with Alzheimer's disease, also Arlen Bitterbuck a chief of an Indian tribe who was given life for murder.reason I say it is boring is because, the story has no real excitement that makes a good story. And in half of the story the book talks about a mouse that keeps messing with the prisoners. The rest of the book just is about the different problems some of the guards have.I Think teens and older people can find better books by Stephen King. Some of his much better books are Cujo, It, and the cycle of the werewolf."

3,Lethargic beauty,"Credit these swooning cynics with attempting an enveloping sound, but in much of the shimmeringly simple and repetitious values, there lies little to really wrap yourself around, often providing just enough layering to keep things above tedious but well below drop dead gorgeous."
2,"Repetitive tone, voice, and beat (not in a good way)","Well, first review I am writing for Amazon mp3. The reason I am writing this review is that I really did not care for this album. It is too repetitive and monotone. Did not really care for it, I wish I could cancel the order.I suggest listening to a few complete tracks prior to buying this, some of you might really like this but it's not for everyone."
2,What A Letdown......,"First of all, I must say that the box to this movie is very misleading! With statements like.... He's Watching, He's waiting, He's not alone and a picture of someone holding a chainsaw!!!, I thought wow, this will be a really good movie. Not the case. This moving is very boring. It takes place in an isolated cabin in the forest with a widowed woman living alone. She meets a man named Michael Bodine and eventually finds out that he is a serial killer on the loose. Before finding this out, Bodine cleverly tries to take on the personality of Lacey's late husband in hopes of gaining her trust and possibly start a romance. Once Lacey discovers who Bodine really is, she begins a fight for her life. This movie could have been worse but it is not a true horror movie for horror movie fans. I've learned not to let the box fool you!!!"
1,im glad it was only 4.99,"seriously, sometimes i watch a movie and i think to myself ""do the people involved in this project really even care how bad their work is?"" or did someone order a group of people to come up with an idea for a movie and make it in a month. to say this movie is bad would be like saying rosie odonnell is kinda ugly. i wont give it the honor of the worst movie ever made, but it is irrelavent, boring, unconvincing, stupid, unstimulating, i could go on. and on. and on... look at the price tag and youll realize there is a reason that its so freaking cheap. its filmed and acted like a soft core porn movie without the sex(which would have made it bearable) DO NOT BY THIS MOVIE!!!!!! or buy it, whatever i dont care"
5,"Excellent scholarly overview - Norse, Germanic & Celtic myth","Dr. Ellis Davidson, in this and in her other works, gives the reader a solid grounding in archaeology, vernacular traditions and other sources of knowledge about Northern European religious traditions."
4,Tremendous book!,"Tremendous book! Davidson's work is very scholarly, but very readable at the same time. Some very interesting comparisons between Norse and Christian mythology."
5,The World as Story,"I found Anthony Patton's book thoughtful and insightful. There is plenty of philosophy, so be prepared to put your thinking cap on. He demonstrates with solid examples from 4 great movies, the elements of a story that are universal to good story telling and, if you think about, to our lives too. As a aspiring writer, I found the book serves a blue print for structuring an idea into a viable story. It's the kind of book you would go back to halfway through writing your own novel or screenplay to make sure you're on the right track."
3,Tooooo Deeeeeep,It's okay but a little too deep. Haven't used it yet guess I might use it this Christmas for a show.
4,Not Very Expensive. Good Fit And Feel,"I've been doing some heavy-duty yard work, including the removal of several small trees, and I had need for a pruning saw. My bow saw worked for a lot of situations but the frame got into the way for others. I went to our nearby hardware store and fount this Green Thumb Double-Edged Pruning Saw. Just what I needed and not too expensive either. It works fine, just as expected, but doesn't seem particularly sharp. My bow saw is much better and has a blade that is over a year old. It's a handy pruning saw, but I'm a bit disappointed. I might add that the fit and feel is quite good, but the blade flexes a bit too much.Gary Peterson"
4,Tangy and sweet,"I picked this one up because anything with the Mavericks on it has promise, and the rest of the album backed that up. I don't know how ""alt"" it is, but this is a great album for someone who isn't really sure they want to get into the whole country music scene. After you listen to this, you'll go willingly- the Emmylou Harris track is my favorite, as well as Steve Earle's Telephone Road. The Mavericks song isn't the one I'd choose, but they did right with the rest....... (except Junior Brown,this guy needs to go)"
3,A nice compilation for cyclists,"Although this book may be slightly dated (consisting of a compilation of approximately 40 articles written for cycling publications in the late '80s and early '90s), the reading is still enjoyable and thought-provoking. Ranging from stories about the pro racing circuit to club rides and everything in between, the author does a nice job on this book. Some of the articles made me think about things I've experienced as a cyclist, but never really thought much about until seeing it on paper.My favorite was the interview with Bob Roll & Alex Stieda (two pro cyclists from 10-15 years ago). Bob Roll is hilarious and this comes across loud & clear in the interview (I wish his book was still in print - I'll bet that's a real knee-slapper!).""Half-Wheel Hell"" makes a great way to relax for a few minutes as you catch your breath from the evening's ride. Probably not of much value to non-cyclists, though."
5,Plays like a dream,"I bought a black Gretsch 5120 last summer, and it's amazing for the price. The best thing about this guitar is how upgradable it is. The Gretschbuster pickups it comes with aren't to everyone's liking, but TV Jones puts out some excellent aftermarket humbuckers you can easily swap in for about $135 each. Aftermarket pickguards run $35 to $75; I plan on buying several and changing the look of my Gretsch periodically.Of course, the Bigsby Vibrato is excellent, a classic guitar accessory you'll rarely see on a guitar in this price range. The neck is very comfortable, and I play it throughNative Instruments Guitar Rig 5 Kontrol Edition, which really makes it sing, even on a cheap amp or P.A. system. If you're a keyboard player as well, you might invest inNative Instruments Komplete 8 Software Suite. A good amp that I plan on matching it with is theFender Super-Champ X2 120v Guitar Amplifier."
4,could be much better....,"i read this book and have to agree with Laura (the first reviewer) - it is misleading for those who think they can learn reiki from a book.also - there wasn't much detail. if you already do Reiki (like me) and are seriously interested in working with animals, it may help a little. for example, two things i specifically wanted to know were the equivalent chakras on a horse and a set of hand positions. these are in the book, but i feel that i would change the hand positions a little from what clare uses.this was written from one person's point of view, and nowadays there are many variations on Reiki. it doesn't make her view wrong or right - just different! it's not a waste of time, but it isn't all that i hoped it would be.on that note - i decided i may try a hand at writing a book on reiki & animals (in particular, horses).Kate"
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this book along with ""Natural Healing For Animals"" by the same author, looking for ""Hands On"" information. Both could be interesting to read if you have no concept of technique and are just curious, but I am familiar with this in humans and was looking for Flow charts to convert my knowledge to use in horses and cats. This is not a practical guide in any way. Only an introduction to concept. I feel I really wasted my money on both books. There is nothing concrete to work with."
5,Playground love,A must track to listen to 'playground love' you will think your in paris - a good choice for a varied album.
5,Sit on the shoulder of a giant,"In this book you have an opportunity to sit through 95 pages on the shoulder of a giant. Some of his observations are outdated - like his pessimism of ever seeing Bose-Einstein condensation - but this in itself is well worth the price of the book alone, to read in contemporary terms a well-informed view of the 1940s adds appreciation of the heroism of the experimental accomplishments of the 1990s that continue to the present. There are interesting insights, not available elsewhere, on just about every page. Having read this, you will be among the few who have read in its entirety a learned treatise by the great Schroedinger, in only 95 pages. That is a few days' work well spent by anyone!"
2,tradutorre tradittore,"Title says it all: either the translator (if this is a translation from german, but I doubt) or the author (I believe actually the latter) do not have enough command of the english language to make it a smooth read. It's a pitty, there are very nice/interesting points of view, and I do not think that just the advanced concepts are to blame for the difficulty of the readout. Any takers out there among the native english speakers nobel laureats to rewrite a classic ?"
5,"Really, you have it all wrong","How in any way does this band sound like Bratmobile or any other really horrible ""grrl Punk"" band? I think the Need has a very unique mix of influences, just punk was left out. I hear more influence from old metal bands than I would ever from any punk bands. Especially more influence from the B-52's. Either of The Need's albums is quite delightful and I suggest you check them out."
5,great album,"excellent 2nd album from the need. while i prefer their debut, this cd just shows the musicianship of these ladies. sadly, i think this is the final cd from them. BUT if you're looking for extensions of these sounds pick up The Transfused and Mocket Pro Forma."
2,Great book but VERY outdated!,"I purchased this book for a good friend that was moving to Oklahoma. Although I love the idea, it is very old and outdated - 1995 to be exact. All of the coupons in the back of the book expired in 1996. I still sent it to my friend and hope that Oklahoma hasn't changed that much in 15 years but I was very disappointed that it was such an old edition."
4,"Good, clever film - so-so print","Although you'll be as confused as the protagonist at first, MASTER STROKE is really clever and quite entertaining through the end. Definitely worth viewing if you can ignore the quality issues. What are they? Well, the print is panned & scanned and faded. At least it's not worn out/excessively scratched. I'd love to see a restored widescreen version of this."
1,Not a good purchase!,"I do not recommend this book. I could have cut and pasted from Cisco's web site and come up with a much better book. Really not a comprehensive coverage of CIT. I have not read the Cisco Press book and this is the first time that I have deviated from the Cisco Press books and absolutely regret it. I threw the book away and pulled out Jeff Doyle's Routing TCP/IP, which is light-years ahead. Hope this helps."
3,i used only this book and failed,This book has too many errors and typos however because i only failed by 1 question i give this book three stars . You may pass by just reading this book if your lucky.
4,it's ok.. a lot of errors though.,"I am reading the book, and generally it's a very good book, for the exception of some really silly mistakes. IF you pay attention to the material, you can very easily identify those errors and will not let them fool you, even though they sound kind of true. A lot of grammatical incorrections as well."
1,it is not enough,don't get this book if you want to pass CIT test. this book is pretty good for overall review but it is not adequate for real test. don't be fooled by other customer's recommendation.
2,Not Useful!!!,"You real can't ""hinge naturally"" with this device. The hinge or the power angle should happen from the momentum of the backswing and pulling of the arms by your lower body movement on the downswing (compressed). Check out some videos of Sergio Garcia on YouTube to get the best understanding.All it maybe really good for is check your positions at very slow pace or pausing.If you need it for that do what I did and find a knock off version on eBay for about $3. This one by Swingyde is way over price. Otherwise I say do without it!"
2,Not great.,"It does what you'd expect it to do, but I don't find myself using it much. First, the plastic is really flimsy. Second, the main fault it is trying to fix can be done with a tee stuck between the pad of your palm and the grip of your club. Expected more..."
1,terrible,This device was a cheap piece of plastic junk. I only ordered one and yet I was billed for two and did receive both but am totally dissatisfied with this product.
1,$30 for what?,"Spend $30 for the hanger drill? That is what you are buying here. Go get a 25 cent hanger, look up the hanger drill online and do the same thing. The hanger drill has been around a long time. This is a great money maker for Jim Flick, but he didn't create the idea. He did know a great drill and marketed, so hat's off to him. But I will save my money and spend it on playing golf"
3,swingdyne trainer,"Swingdyne trainer was easy to put together, video was definitely helpful. Personally it was good to have this product to occasionally ""refer"" back to in my swing drills. As far as a primary aid in my golf swing, not so much use. It certainly depends on your individual golf swing, it does remind you to ""finish"" the swing. I purchased this product because of the relatively low cost and recommendations. I will use it in my constant unrelenting effort to improve the ""perfect"" swing (which if we all ever swung twice the same way it would help) would buy this product again, but like all products it is not the panacea."
4,Swingyde is swing guide!!!,"I bought this tool because I would like to adjust my backswing and finish position. This tool helps much on my swing correction. However, I do not like the material of the Swingyde. It seems not very strong and the material looks cheap (with $29 you have to pay). Hopefully, it is not easily broken."
4,It Helps!,This device leads you in the right direction regarding wrist cock. I was never sure if I was cocking my wrist correctly. Now I am...
3,Ehh,"It may help with a basic height of swing, but I can't see that it helps much with the swing itself. Maybe I haven't used it enough but it just didn't quite meet my expectations."
3,My golf instructor uses this?,"My PGA Certified golf instructor uses this but I think there might be a better method of maintaining your angles. Still, I keep using it."
4,Swingyde,This little plastic piece is very helpful. I have been hitting better shots that are straighter & sometimes i suprise myself with a draw. I think that it's worth the investment if you are serious about playing better golf.
2,Really?,I'll admit that I purchased the Swingyde based on the reviews i read. Bad mistake. I play golf at least once a week. In my opinion this is priced 25 bucks too much. It mainly helps you hinge your wrist on the back swing and nothing else. There is SOOOO much more to a golf swing than hinging your wrist! My opinion- pass on this product and get some lessons -preferably an instructor that records your swing and analyzes it with you one on one afterwards.
5,It works!!!,There is so much snake oil on the market. It is nice to actually buy a training item that works. It does exactly what it claims. It lets you know if you have rotated and cocked your wrists enough. This alone will help you hit straighter and longer. If this is something you already do it is great for tune ups. Super easy to use.
2,Not a very useful training tool,"I bought this based on the reviews. But actually it didn't work for me at all. It is not worth it. The hinge between the club and your wrist is just one small thing in the whole golf swing. If you are a beginner, you should focus on grip, stance, tempo. During back swing, keep your head still, keep your right knee flex and keep your weight at the inner side of your right foot. This thing won't help you."
4,Very nice,"- It helps me swing with a correct plane.- It helps create consistency.- It helps me do dignosis in my swing. If it does not rest on my left arm properly, something must have changed in my swing and I can start fixing it. (or at least I know that there is a problem in my swing on that day.)- It's small and light weight. Can be carried to anywhere.- It can be combined with Medicus swing trainer or Skiltz Refiner.I liked so much that I purchased one more. I can now put it to a short club and a long club at the same time and see if I can swing properly altenating the clubs."
2,awkard,Found it to be very akward and insructions were unreliable. Took me a while to ascertain that the opening was put on the grip and not on the shaft.
3,Just Ok,"This product helps you set your wrists at the top of the backswing but I don't know if it helps all that much at""the moment of truth."" I know the logic behind it makes sense, if you're not at the right position at the top, you can't get into the right position at the bottom of the swing. It's a little hard to get used to the feel. The strength of the product is that it helps you distinguish between feel and real at the wrist hinge/top of the swing position."
5,Great golf product,"Its a pretty cheap looking training aid, but it works very well. Its simple to use but helps a ton!"
5,The Swingyde is great!,I purchased the Swingyde to help me with the wrist hinge in my golf swing. I wasn't sure I was doing it correctly and wanted some instant feedback. The device is wonderful. I use it to practice and in my warm up before a round. My iron striking has improved dramatically.
5,Great Swing Aid be Patient Though,"I bought this swing aid i must say for the reviews and to honest with you when i first got it not really impressed. I practiced with it a week before my first round and it showed my that my wrist position was incorrect at the top of the swing and not following through properly. I went out with my new swing and went and shot an 88 not what I expected since my index is 3.4 , but i played the last four holes at 1 under and picked up these new positions. I am happy to say my next round was 1 under wow! Be patient with it it works it just takes time my coach said 500 swings before your muscle memory kicks in!"
2,Not for Me,"I bought this based on the Amazon rating. I was hoping it would fix my swing. However, it doesn't provide me with any feedback. Maybe my wrist hing is already where it needs to be. I also believe this to be overpriced for what you get. Changing clubs is tedious, luckily I have a spare 5 iron which I was able to set it up and leave it on."
4,Great product,"Great product. Helped me become more consistent with my swing. Price is a little high for what it is, but still recommend it"
3,Its ok but not what i needed,I believe that this product has some value for people who are fixated on swing plain. My issue was not plain but grip and foot position. I cured my slice on the course playing along side a pro for one round. Good bye slice and good riddens.
1,Not my cup of tea,"I have read other reviews where people have said this straighted out their swing however, I did not like it. I am sure it works for some people but it just feels too odd for my taste. I am thinking about selling mine, brand new, only used once. It just wasn't for me. I would rather keep buying range time."
1,Plastic crap,"For the price the Swingyde is not worth the money. It is difficult to set up correctly, and it really does not give that much feed back. I forsee it breaking in the near future as it is literally a plastic piece of crap. Just goes to show golfers will buy almost anything in their quest for par. Save your money on this one."
4,Suits its purpose,This is more like a handbook of useful phrases. For a beginner this is a great start. It by no means will teach you tagalog but you will be able to understand and use common speech. Good entry level book.
4,Good phrase book.,"I thought this book was great for simple phrases, easy to follow, very easy and helpful to use. Great first step in to learning Tagalog basics."
3,A So-So learning experience,"I have studied Pilipino before and would saY HONESTLY THATTHIS BOOK IS MARGINAL BECAUSE IT USES SEMANTIC AND GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES THAT DO NOT INCORPORATE THE TRUE ESSENCE OF THE TAGALOG USED IN THE PHILIPPINES AS I LEARNED AND USED WHEN I LIVED IN MANILA. In any case, it is a marginal usage of Tagalog and I would not buy this book if I were serious about learning Tagalog for anything other than getting in and out of manila International Airport....if that...if at all."
5,Excellent Phrase book,This is an excellent phrase book to use for travelers and anyone interested in learning this interesting language. It has very good phonetic spellings and easy-to-read layouts of pages.I highly recommend this book as a must-have companion to additional study materials.
1,Does Not Fit 2008 Pontiac Vibe,"I purchased this item, Anco 31-11, as a replacement for the rear windshield wiper on my 2008 Pontiac Vibe. Amazon (and other sources) indicated it would fit my car. With absolute certainty, I can say that this is not true.The plastic ""claw"" on the Vibe wiper arm that engages the wiper blade's frame requires an opening of about 0.47 inch in that frame, but the opening on this Anco Part is less than 0.36 inch. Do they expect us to modify our cars to fit this so-called replacement part? It was also not possible to use the rubber element from this Anco part to replace the deteriorated element in the existing wiper frame, as the element is too wide. This part is totally useless to me.I just purchased a replacement that DOES fit from my local NAPA store, NAPA ""Exact Fit"" #60-011-A. It cost $12.33 + tax, nearly twice what I paid for this Anco Part, but at least it fits."
1,Wrong information,I used the amazon drop downs with my make/model. Said this would fit my rear wiper blade...well it doesn't!2005 Mazda tribute
1,Wrong Info,"I purchased this Anco 3111 wiper blade for my 2004 Ford Escape rear window. Amazon website said it would fit my vehicle. Unfortunately, it does not. Might be a perfectly good blade, however, I will never know."
2,"Seems nice, doesn't fit",I purchased the Anco 3111 because other auto websites said this was a replacement for the rear wiper blade of a 2002 Jeep Liberty. Guess they were wrong!! It has the wrong clip and would never work correctly. I should have went by the Amazon site which said it DOES NOT fit my vehicle. Guess I'll try another blade!
5,Awsome photo work.,Even if you don't like to read you will love this book for it's excellent recopilation of photo work. You will buy this book.
4,Trees,"This is a wonderful basic reference book for ""getting to know"" the trees. Heck, I live in Florida ... I'd be ashamed if I didn't recognize some of them. Good condition. Quick delivery."
5,"Beautiful Images, Interesting Information","""The Meaning of Trees"" is a truely beautiful and interesting work, especially for nature-loving folks like myself. The presentation of information is visually very appealing, as well as mentally stimulating. The book discusses and shares breath-taking photos of almost 60 different species of trees, and dispenses information on each from general characteristics, information and history, to practical uses, natural healing, culture/myth/symbolism, and more. A valuable and attractive addition to anyone's library!"
3,The Meaning of Trees,"Nice photos and good discriptions of trees. The accompaning mythological lore is quite interesting also. A substantial, weighty and high quality book in terms of print and paper quality also. A very nice coffee table volume. Recommended for tree lovers and mythology fans."
2,Accessories hard to find,"I've owned mine for about 4 years and am content with the power, performance and price. However, this grinder uses a smaller mounting shaft than the incrementally larger 4 1/2"" grinders. I am finding that accessories like wire brushes and such are getting more and more scarce in store shelves. Home Depot, which sells this grinder, did not have any brushes for this tool when I recently visited. If you're only going to use grinding wheels, you can probably find them easily enough. I believe the small size of this tool also limits the maximum diameter of wheels and brushes. You can certainly save a nickel by getting this one, but unless you are on a super-tight budget, get a 4 1/2"" version.One positive on this tool: if I'm not mistaken, it is designed to be used with AC and DC power, so you can run it off of a generator."
1,Burnt Out,This grinder worked fine with a four inch tile blade to make hand cuts on ceramic tile and slate.I used it with a segmented blade to chase a hairline crack on a concrete floor I was preping to tile and it burnt out after about four linear feet.I would not recomend it for anything but light duty use.
5,An escape valve,"I'm a DD fan from way back. What I love about this cd is the fact that they have returned to form. I agree with the other reviews with one additional observation. I remember when bands like DD ruled the musical landscape. The world feared nuclear destruction and the world outside of most peoples control was very heavy. Bands like DD had freshness and escapism. I am so pleased to hear a cd that helps people escape politics, war and angst, even if it's only for an hour or so. It's refreshing all over again!"
3,It's hardly a masterpiece..,"I've been folowing this album for for 2 years and after thousands of hours in the studio with world class producers I'm dissapointed. Don't get me wrong the album's ok, I won't b demanding my $ back but I just DON'T understand all these 5 star reviews."
2,Disappointment!!!,"I am not sure where these true Duran Duran fans have been over the last 20 years, but this album does not belong in the year 2004. I was more disappointed in this album than I was in the Halloween sequel movies. The only place this album belongs in are the night clubs on Bourbon Street in New Orleans!!"
2,Reunion disc fails to soar .,"The much anticipated re-union of Britain's Duran Duran took on a life of it's own. With an extended tour to get the buzz out about their re- emergence as a five piece with an album waiting in the wings,it seemed inevitable that the group would creatively gel to record a masterpiece. After all of the hype, a common thread at the height of their synth pop 80's success, enhanced with their cutting edge videos, glossy fashion senese, and movie star looks, Duran Duran hit the airwaves with the 12 song"
1,Blah blah blah...,I cannot and do not believe that all these so called Duran Duran fans actually think this album is a 5 STAR RATING!!!You are kidding ..right? Just another 80's band who thinks they still have what it takes. I don't think so. Don't get sucked into all the hype.
5,Just like old times,"I have to agree with the previous review, many of these songs reminded my of earlier Duran2 albums from Rio to Big Thing. It's kinda of like finding forgotten songs. This is a CD you can listen to all the tracks and every time it just gets better. I used to love Duran Duran, but haven't really paid attention to them in recent years. I saw the video for ""Reach up for the Sunshine"" last nite on VH1 Classic and could not believe how good they sounded. They still have the magic."
4,I wasn't going to buy - But then I heard it,I borrowed this cd from a friend and all I can say is this is one of the better comeback cd's I have heard. I wasn't going to buy it but then I did. They have updated the sound and Andy Taylor is definetely standing out a bit more but it's still Duran Duran.I think this is worth the money. The lead single is great and tremendously catchy. The rest of the songs except for one are strong too. The packaging on the DVD version is top notch. The production is good. Overall this is truly great album for them and a welcome return.
4,Love it,Was very surprized by this disc.... all great cuts no filler...A touch of the 80's without the overkill some bands have tried latley....(tears for fears).....The new arrangments sound fresh not forced.. thank you guys for a well crafted CD
4,Back from the dead,"Better than you'd think. If you are a fan ( and if you've gotten this far , you are ) this album is quite good. DD rock harder , keep a hard groove tighter and stick in your brain more than they have in more years than I care to count. Gorgeous vocal melodies, hook-filled bass lines, synth effects and subtle but effective guitar power chords ( welcome back Andy Taylor !! ) all add up to the comeback of the year. Most all the songs on this disc I want to hear more than once ( a rarity in this age of throwaway pop music.) I couldn't find this Special Edition at my local chain store so I ordered this from Amazon and got it the day after it was released. The bonus DVD is great and only leaves me wanting more. The notes in the cd case - which is gorgeous - state that it is from the ""upcoming live dvd"" that is surely better than Arena,which was crap. The live band is stripped to the original five piece and has never sounded better. Quite the comeback."
5,An Ex-Duranie chimes in....,"Short and sweet: This album is terribly overproduced and polished, but the music is so good you won't care.Fun, fresh and modern-sounding new wave funk is the only way to describe this cool album. I honestly didnt think they could pull this off and was expected to be sorely let down. I was completely wrong in my assumptions.It might just be me, but each song takes me back to a certain time period while still sounding fresh.Chains and Finest Hour harken back to the Notorious/Big Thing years while Astronaut reminds me of the Seven and The Ragged Tiger days.Simply put, I am known in circles to be an ex-Duranie, but when something this good comes out ANYONE should be a Duranie."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","People seem to be really at extremes on this album. I find it neither to be a revelation, nor is it horrible. Let me preface this with a statement of bias. I am a huge fan of old DD. ""Girls on Film"" is a particular favorite.I'm not sure how to articulate this, but the music on this Album sounds thin to me. The songs are catchy, with a nice hook for the most part, but the music lacks the richness of DD of the past. Its not the vocals, or the instruments really, they are pretty much the same. It must be something in the production quality that is lacking.I'm glad DD is back together, I'm looking forward to the tour, but I'm not convinced this is a 5 star effort.***Amendement: I saw DD live on Feb. 19th. The songs from this album performed live were fantastic. Boy, Simon le Bon can still sing and dance. Based on this, I stick with my original thought that the problem with this album is production related and not the songs or vocals."
4,Duran's Weak Link returns,"To cut to the chase, if you liked Duran Duran in the 80's, you'll like this. Very similar feel. And in particular, Le Bon is in great voice while John's playing is outstanding. Rhodes has completely ditched his 80's style to go with the Mirwais-trademark blips and bleeps. Not a bad thing, as both styles are good.However, that leads me to the Return of the Weak Link, Andy. I've never cared for his style (non-inventive, dull, thin sound), and it is no different today than it was 20 years ago. It is a shame that Cuccurullo left (he is truly first-rate). I'd have preferred another disc with Warren than the joy of a full-blown reunion."
1,Very Disappointed,"What is more exciting than the original Duran Duran? Something done by the original guys in the 80's. I was very happy to see some of my favorite hotties back and the music reminded me of their early work. But, the songs lacked the true Duran qualities. They now sound like a bunch of horny old men...did anyone read the words to some of the songs? Their first single had me salivating...I couldn't wait to get the CD, now I wish I had. I was VERY disapointed and I have liked EVERYTHING they have done in the past.I have followed these guys FOREVER and will still love them forever but I have to say this album was a let down!"
2,"Flat, Forgettable, Disappointing. Get Cuccurullo Back.","There's no edge here, no memorable melodies, no soaring, no irony, no inventiveness or chances taken. It's flat as a pancake.Where are the Playing with Uraniums, the So Long Suicides, the Last Day on Earths, the Big Bang Generations? This album is just out of gas, safe, without inspiration or energy, complacent. I never thought I'd think that about a Duran Duran album. It's like an insult. Shoot: I was so looking forward to it."
2,Disappointment,"Huge disappointment. I have no doubt these tunes will be all over the discothèques next summer - these are dancing melodies, fun and full of funky sound, but very predictable, all right for teenagers. Sounds like a mix of old Jamiraquai (his disco tunes) combined with eight years old Freak Power . I would rather call this album `cute' than `strong'. Bass is missing. There are few nice (again, nice, not strong) songs at the end. Their 'Big Thing' sounds much more mature.Well, two stars since I am still a fan"
4,Back on track,"I already have ordered tickets for their once off UK gig in Birmingham in May 2005 as I feel that ""the wild boys"" once again will kick ass. To me, Double Duran has always been outstanding in the sense that they always made experimental but somewhat catchy music. ""Medazzaland"" was perhaps their weakest album in years but ""Thank you"" was a blessing. Astronaut is a real rocket (to use related terminology)and there is more to listen to than just the opening track. The extra DVD is brilliant as well. Not only can one catch the fab 5 on tour and on stage but it proofes again that Duran Duran is a live band unlike many other pop bands especially in todays pop business.Its also funny to see Nick Rhodes wonder about wearing his first ever Denim jeans on stage."
5,80's Funk meets Y2K Pop,"Okay - first it must be said that back in the 80's, I was Duran's number one fan (or at least my pre-teen mind thought so). Given that little tidbit of information regarding myself (the reviewer), I think that ""Astronaut"" is the best album my favorite Brits have released since they started losing members (I mean literally, not figuratively) way back. I love Simon's voice, John's funky Bass playing, Nick's keyboarding skills, Andy's lead guitar and Roger's drumming. ""Sunrise"" and ""Bedroom Toys"" are my favs! I would recommend this as a staple purchase in anyone's music repertoire. I'm already looking forward to their next release . . ."
2,I think I bought the wrong CD,"Some of the songs in this CD are good, but most of them are not. Song number 2 and 3, Desilusion and Despierta Boricua are great, but the rest are bad. Maybe you want to buy another CD rather than this one."
4,Works superbly but needs coarser stone,"I have owned this sharpener for several years. I use it to sharpen my 15"" planer knives and 8"" jointer knives as well as my chisels and hand plane knives. I have the 4000 grit stone as well as the 1000. I get excellent results and the 4000 grit stone creates truly a razor sharp edge. Yes, it's messy. Yes, there are some plastic parts that are a bit cheap and flimsy. But bottomline: it does a very fine job for me. However.... and a BIG however...... Makita does not make a coarser stone. Highland Hardware offered one for a while, but it has been discontinued. Taking the dings out of my planer knives takes a VERY long time with the 1000 grit stone. I messed up and put off buying the Highland stone. So, the 1000 grit is as coarse as I can get. PLEASE Makita, pretty please, offer a coarse stone!!!"
3,Takes time to learn how to do it right,"I use this for plane irons, chisels, and jointer blades. It gets the job done, but only with a 120 grit stone and a hand tool attachment available from Highland Hardware."
2,Expected more,"This unit is flimsy and not easy to set up. It's not easy to set up because the design of this machine is done very cheaply. If your using a course stone you will run out of water very quickly, which is not convenient. Very messy to use too. I did get the unit set up to sharpen some jointer blades and the results were ok. I honestly don't know much about sharpening and that is why I was hoping this machine would be straight forward to set up,use and get very good results. It's not. A good quality sharpener for blades and tools must cost a lot more! If possible, see one in action before you buy it."
4,As advertised,I received my Makita 9820-2 promptly and unpacked it. Assembly was minimal. Instructions for its use were sketchy in parts but it is a fairly straight forward tool. The learning curve is short and my results met my expectations. My planer and jointer blades are sharper than when I had them done professionally. I would recommend getting a courser stone if you have to do anything but hone your blades. Overall I would say that this product performed as advertised.
1,DTS recording cannot be read,"I bought this CD because of the DTS recording. I had 4 other DTS recording before and marvelled at the quality of 5.1 recordings. Unfortunately, the sample I have produces only white noise. If you do not have the proper decoder you might hear white noise but I tried it on two DVD players rated with DTS decoding and which play my other DTS CDs. I also tried it on my computer using multiple software players (like VLC)that can read DTS. Zip nada on this one, just white noise....I did not bother contacting the vendor (probably because I am lazy). I cannot judge the quality of the recording which I never heard."
1,Worst disc I have ever purchased,This sounds like one guy playing an organ or synthesizer. Why listen to this when we could listen to a full orchestra with the proper classical instruments? The description by Amazon is not accurate. And the surround sound is sub par. I am going for a refund as I feel ripped off.
4,A Musical Legend,"Jerome Robbins accomplished more in his lifetime than many other Broadway icons.He wrote, choreographed, danced ,and directed many musicals and ballets. He was at times very nasty and demanding of the cast he worked with. He also had lots of friend. This book chronicles his childhood through to his death. The author spends time detailing both the ballet part of Robbins life and the Broadway part. Unless you are a dancer, the Broadway life is much more interesting. There are loads of interesting facts in this book. For instance ,Mary Martin was considered for the lead in Funny Girl !!! Jerome Robbins life was fascinating. His story is easy to read and really holds your interest. Advice, skim the ballet sections."
1,Tedious and vulgar,"Very little to do with dance, this book is mostly personalities and scandal. The not-very-subtle subtext is Robbins' homosexuality, and its relation to the HUAC affair. Strictly for celebrity hounds."
5,this is the best album after Celine Back!,"I got this Album on 10 Oct. in Hong Kong, after i listened, such a touching album, a new singing method From True Diva Celine, no more shouted, use her beautiful voice to sing that much Mother-loved songs...in this album, i like ""come to me"" and ""what a wonderful world"", this pics album is very touching and aboout the DVD, it made me shocked... esp when I saw this music video from the DVD...very very good!i really want to watch the 180 pages books very soon!last words!ladies and Gentlemen......pls order this album ASAP! u must won't regret at all! trust me!"
5,A Beautiful Miracle,"This is simply the best for a new mom, and the pics are beautiful with music by Celine that will amaze. My neice just had a new baby girl, and she loved this gift I gave her.Because ALL Babies are truly a miracle."
1,I hate it !,I am wondering WHEN this plague will be over....and WHEN we'll be set free to listen to real music...We all are so tired of her !
1,Add Me To The List Of Unhappy Customers,"Like many other people writing reviews here, this item arrived broken. The ""TOC Read"" seemed to be the problem. Amazon replaced it with no fuss. I wouldn't recommend this machine. Since it replaced a Pioneer 6 CD changer I bought way back in 1990, it's a mystery why this machine must pause to ""read"" each disc while you're standing there waiting to hear music. The shuffle play is terrible, since it heavily favors certain CDs over others, and worse, plays up to four cuts in a row from the same CD. Not my idea of random or shuffle play. The Pioneer it replaced was 15 years older technology, yet the Pioneer was superior in every way. The Pioneer's random play was awesome...no repeats, no loooong pauses to read each CD, no two cuts in a row from the same CD, and it didn't favor any one Cd over another. DON""T buy this machine."
1,"DOA, Part II",This is the second Teac 5-CD player I have ordered that was busted right out of the box. To say that I am dissatisfied with Teac would be an understatement. I will never buy another Teac product again.
1,A piece of junk,"This component can seem to work ok at times, but I had the ""TOC read"" problem as well. It just would not find the disk in the tray--incredibly frustrating. I had it serviced under the warranty, but they could not find anything wrong--they just cleaned the lenses. Then it worked ok for a month or so, before the ""TOC read"" problem came up again.Look elsewhere for a CD-player."
3,ok.,"it works.sounds good enough.cheap.nuthin' fancy here.remote sorta sucks.plays all discs pretty well, even scratched ones do ""ok""."
2,Lasted one Year,"Have had this CD player exactly one year & it stops working.Worked just OK, thought I'd get a couple of years out of it forthe price, I was wrong."
2,Worked fine for a while,"I got this about 7 months ago. It worked fine until now. Ticking sound all the time and now it is very picky about what it will play. Skips and stops! How in the world can it stop? I have a CD which plays fine on other players, but not this one. Amazingly, when I copied the CD on my computer, it will play the copy without a problem. Not acceptable. Needless to say, I'm going to replace it with another brand, probably the Onkyo DX-C390."
3,Broken upon arrival,"After carefully opening the box, I noticed the 'drawer' was not completely in. It would not go in or out after applying power and pushing the open/close button. I was able to remove the case cover and get to where the drive is and reset the entire unit to open/close, For the price, I am not sure if it is worth it to another purchaser! Luckily I have enough knowledge to repair such electronics!"
4,Mr. Bluesorgan's burning live date,"This 1963 Sue Records live album from Harlem's legendary Apollo Theater, and Jimmy McGriff's third recording under his own name according to [...],is a surprisingly fresh and steamin'B3 blues groove session. His 1963 working band works fine together but as individuals these musicians don't stand out and provide many memorable moments. McGriff shows that he's already a master of blues- and soul organ and particulary on ""There Will Never Be Another You"" you hear his playing tribute to his mentor - Jimmy Smith. McGriff originals like ""The Decon"" works best for the group and the swing is always present in McGriff's roaring B3. Why not start in chronological order when collecting McGriff albums - this CD is a must!"
3,Title should be: History of Canard: A Revolution in Flight,"Andy Lennon was known as a prolific writer about the design of model aircraft, including much useful information on how to go about designing. Based on that knowledge, I had assumed that this book contained information on how to design canard aircraft. It does not. It is a history of the development and implementation of canards for full-scale aircraft. In addition to text, it contains a great many photos and drawings of canard planes. So as a history book it is fine but of little value for design purposes."
3,good,"This book was good like the other reviewers here said, but it is lacking in images/pics to illustrate the points noted. Lots of good information in the book, but I wish it was organized differently. I think the subtitle is too ambitious and arrogant. Somehow, the book seems outdated too... I've seen better."
4,Good Product,I had purchased bamboo cutting boards but soon learned that they warp and don't clean well in the dishwasher. I purchased various sizes of this product and we have used them for several months now without any real problems. They clean easily and they provide a nice carving and cutting surface. The only draw back seems to be that they scar a bit when we use very sharp knives. Over time I don't know how well they will hold up due to the minor scaring after just a few months.
4,simply great,ordered this item because i took a music class for college and had to do a listening for him. this CD really shows massenet's style. its calming. helps me fall asleep at night.
2,Color of the flags,"The picture was misleading as I thought the flags would be assorted in red, white and blue as the picture shows. I was disappointed when they arrived to find out I was shipped four boxes of blue flags. I went back to the website and after scrolling down it did state that the color was blue. The picture should be changed to just show blue if that's all that is offered!"
1,"have not received, ripped off!","i am very upset at this, i had placed an order on 09/18/2009 and today 10/19/2009 i have still nothing to watch. i am a huge mark dugdale fan, and due to this i can not enjoy this dvd. hope amazon fixes the problem because i was billed for this an have not yet received an apology letter. becareful of what you buy in here i have had great business with amazon and still plan to purchase, but a little more careful now."
1,it's [not good],"don't waste you'r money juggalos, get shockumentary if you wan't a documentary, even if you'r a collector, it's not put out by psychopathic, no need to collect it."
2,It was definitely not a documentary,This video was definitely not a documentary but mostly talk about when they were with disney. I must agree with the first critic and say you wont hear any of there songs or performances. The tape does not display icp's talent. I have to say i was somewhat disappointed that i did'nt see anything new as i expected.
4,good value for the price,after a year of use and abuse my hitachi is still going strong.it drills fast and easy and in hammer mode drives ground rods and does light demolition effortlessly.i prefer the spline shank drills and accesories over the little sds shank bits but i do use an adaptor for the slightly cheaper sds or taper shanks in the smaller sizes.industrial machinery installation is tuff on tools but the hitachi DH38YE not only came through with flying colors but outlasted a much more expensive brand.
2,TKO in the first round,"I bought this rotary hammer for drilling in grout holes for rebar and anchor bolts and some other misc. holes in concrete. It is a very good tool for someone who has a lot of varied tasks but dosen't work the tool everyday. The clutch is a wrist saver, the bits are harder to find than SDS Max and the price is right. But the tool went down in a matter of hours, and given Hitachi's impossible to locate parts, I'm shopping for a SDS Max Hilti or Bosch. No tool is a good deal if it shuts your job down."
3,"Dissapointing, but not worthless","I am a big Boss Hog fan and had been anticipating the release of this album for a while. Unfortunately, I was a little dissapointed when I finally bought it. The songs aren't neccesarily bad (except for ""Get It While You Wait"" which sounds like Garbage for christ's sake!) they're just not as good as previous albums. However, there are a few songs that are really good. ""Nursery Rhyme"", ""Fear For You"", and especially ""Monkey"" are great old school Boss Hog songs. If you're a big Boss Hog fan this is probably worth getting, but if you're new to Boss Hog I would recommend starting with thier self-titled album on Geffen or the Girl+ EP (if you can still find it)."
5,Rock On!,"Okay, some of those negative reviews ignore the fact that this LP does, in fact, rock. Some of the NY scum has been scraped away, but Xna and Co can still kick it. Yeah, maybe it's a little more ""acceptable"", but they're not 18 anymore, and maybe don't feel they have to prove their punk rock credentials (which are there in spades: JSBX, Goats, Honeymoon Killers, Gibson Bros., Pussy Galore, etc). And frankly I think InTheRed missed the boat 'cos this shoulda been bigger than Garbage and their ilk. It sure is more fun to listen to."
4,Smashing,"Smashing, trashy, sleazy and classy. this sounds and feels a million miles away from the faceless minions of contemporary american alt.rock. just one more thing, why can't Jon Spencer tame down the ""BLOOZE EXPLOSION"" exhultations and do something half as good as this during his day job?"
2,Whiteout - aptly titled.,"Boss Hog give us the companion piece to Gang of Four's _Mall_, which as those who've heard Go4's _Mall_, well, it ain't much...a glossy sheen put over the some recognizable Hogisms which aren't catchy enough to be mainstream pablum and these cuts don't rock enough to interest any of their previous fanbase...although the last cut sorta almost delivers a little bit of the rock...still nothing compared to ""Ruby"" or ""Gerard"". I don't know, maybe the Ma & Pa Spence are too busy trying not to wake the baby...can't say as though I recommend this at all..even to the diehard apologist, this is just a complete whiteout..."
5,German Picture Dictionary,I ordered the German Picture Dictionary title. The book arrived in perfect condition (just as they'd quoted) and the service was FAST! I'd order from them again. Thanks for having this out-of-print book.
4,EARLY MALMSTEEN,"VERY GOOD LIVE CD FROM THIS VERY GOOD BAND FEATURING GUITAR LEGEND MALMSTEEN AND FORMER RAINBOW VOCALIST GRAHAM BONNETT.LOTS OF HARD ROCKING, SEARING LEAD GUITAR, AND GRITTY VOCALS."
3,poor recording of fine music,"J.C. Bach: Sinfonias, Vol. 1I agree with some of Chris's comments in his review, it is very pleasant music, and the 30 year old ""London Bach"" does sound a lot like the 16 year old Mozart, and that is praise. Camerata Budapest is probably playing quite well, but it is difficult to hear because of the awfull acoustics. It was recorded in Festetich castle, which sounds like an echo chamber. If you like the music, and it is difficult not to, I urge you to buy the recording by the Academy of St Martins in the Fields, THE chamber orchestra of its time. Although an old recording, 1970, the sound is very good and the performance first class."
5,Did the job perfectly,"I bought an extra one of these for modification into an erecting eyepiece, for converting Canon long telephoto lenses into spotting scopes (in particular, my 100-400mm). The project went exactly as planned, and resulted in a very useful eyepiece that fit snugly into the lens, eliminating the necessity of buying a spotting scope to match the optical quality of my 100-400mm, and eliminating a heavy spotting scope from having to be dragged along on birding trips."
5,Good to have an extra,This is a nice extra to have in your camera bag...I keep mine in a ziplock bag so that it doesn't pickup dust and I have an extra if all the lenses are off my camera. Fits all EF and EF-S lenses. Just like the one you get with the lens.
3,rear lens cap rip-off,"again canon seems to like to charge a little more for their plastic. no need to pay 6-10 bucks. just go get an off brand rear lens cap. sure it doesn't say canon on it, but I am sure it will protect your rear lens just the same."
3,paying for the brand name . . .,"Canon's lens caps are well-designed, and provide a snug tight fit, with a minimum of effort. They work perfectly with Canon lenses, as well as with Canon compatible lenses by Tokina, Tamron and Sigma. The same can't be said for some Tamron lens caps, which are fine on a Tamron lens, but loose on some Canon lenses. Tokina's caps may not be as easy to grip, but might fit even tighter than Canon's.While functionality is not an issue, cost is. Like many photo accessories, this Canon cap is overpriced, unless you think seven dollars for a piece of plastic is not ridiculous. There are alternatives. Manufacturers in Asia, expert at copying products, sell comparable lens caps on eBay, for a for a dollar or two. The Canon cap is great, but if you can get an equivalent product much cheaper, does it really matter who's name is on it?"
2,not the Mouse i thought i knew.,"I am a long time Eek-A-Mouse fan. I have several albums and have seem him in concert a half dozen times and this is not what i was expecting from a truly unique reggae star. The track 'Uptown Dread' is a great track and if the album had more tracks similar it would be a fantastic album but most of the tracks stray away from The Mouse's reggae roots. The Mouse is awesome live and he needs to release a live album. If you ever have the chance to see him in concert, don't pass it up."
3,"Poor Editing, Nice Introduction","If you can get past the misspellings and awkward writing style, this book presents a nice introduction to P2P networking. The book's contributors all seem to be experts in this field, so I'm surprised that they allowed the book to be released before it was properly edited."
3,A Shawn Phillips Fan!,"I was a bit disappointed in the song selections on the DVD. However, since I'm such a big S.P. fan it can be overlooked. Quality of the DVD was O.K., but nothing like the studio recordings."
1,"Good music, bad discs","This disc literally locked up both my blu-ray and regular DVD players part way through the concert so I returned it for another, but it had the same problem so I returned it also. Thank you Amazon for taking them back.Otherwise, the music that I was able to hear is typical Swawn Phillips, in other words ""great"". Based on his music my wife and I imagined him to have a something of a mystical, maybe even zen-like persona but it turns out he is just a regular guy. Cool!"
3,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--Sweet music--but recycled.,"Sweet & charming, but compiled from Van Fleet's other albums. The Eye Of The Hipster advises--If you have a number of Van Fleet items, you might wish to think twice before buying.The Hipster gives it a Thumbs Up!"
1,Don't buy from Hulagirltoo,"Ordered the Artec Kiwi Manipulating Wax - spray cap had lipstick on it like someone was trying to bite the cap off. Completely disgusting! Product is great - seller sucks. Will never, never ever buy anything from them again."
4,Yay brass!,"Anyone who appreciates brass music will enjoy this CD. There are a few songs that had versions I didn't really care for, but hey...nobody's perfect. The music was great, and it was well played...I guess I just have discriminating taste. I especially liked ""St. Louis Blues"" and ""Rondo Alla Turca"". Huzzah! Keep on tootin'!"
4,Item was just as advertised,The item arrived in very good condition and I was happy with the entire process.
1,Einstein would be appalled!,"We couldn't be more disappointed with this product. The opening credits put us all to sleep. Nana, Mommie, and Baby could not sit through even half of the DVD. Baby Signing Times are delightful, and we assumed this would be better. Boy were we wrong!!"
3,Baby Einstein DVD,"The DVD is okay, my 7 month old has not shown much interest. I do like the sign language that is played throughout the DVD."
2,For Older Children?,"I have had the pleasure of teaching my hearing grandchildren to sign and I was looking forward to adding this video to our signing library. I was disappointed with both the format and the word selection. The format does not hold the attention of my grandchildren and the words are of marginal interest to them - market, bakery, florist, etc. My grandchildren are more interested in signs for words such as milk, eat, more, all done, mommy, daddy, baby, etc. Perhaps this video is more appropriate for older children?My grandchildren have learned more than forty signs from the My Baby Can Talk videos - they are simply enchanted by these videos. Even my older grandchildren continue to watch these videos with their younger siblings and they all interact with the videos while they watch. I would recommend this series for preverbal babies and babies who are beginning to speak."
2,The worst of Baby Einstein,"I have a special needs child who loves most all Baby Einstein videos. He walked away from this one after 1 minute. So did my typical 18 month old. It does very little to engage the children. It's boring, and like the previous mom mentioned....""what baby needs to know the sign for 'bank' and 'salon'?"". ""Signing Times"" videos are much better."
5,RP30SA Buyer,"I bought this vacuum about 2 months ago and have used from everything from vacuuming up my woodworking shop, drywall dust, the car, you name it. I think its the best vacuum I have ever owned and here is why: 1. Very portable. Light and moves well on its wheels. A long cord. 2. A lot of suction although through a 2"" hose it will only clog on hunks that are clearly too big. Sucks up nails, stone, bolts, etc. no problem. 3. Very quiet. Enough said. 4. Nice quality throught. Stainless drum and high quality parts. 5. Does not tip over easily. 6. Good storage for hose and parts. The suction attachments are very good. 7. Very easy to clean. 1 minute to pop arart empty the drum and reassemble. 8. Very good filter. I dont think anything makes it back out in to the exhaust stream.A little pricy but you will agree its agreat vacuum and looks like it will last years."
2,Not the trail mix I was expecting,"If one is NOT expecting a trailmix bar or some gluten-free granola in the bar, this product would merit at least one or maybe two more stars. No grains of any sort are detectable, and I wanted something crunchy. On the other hand, if one is craving dates, this bar will satisfy the desire. I have given 5 star ratings to other Pure Bar flavors, but this one totally disappointed me. I wish I could return the box."
2,So-so,"I have tried several other of the PURE bars and really enjoy their flavor and overall taste! However, the chocolate chip trail mix is a disappointment. I like chocolate and thought this would be a nice alternative to the brownie bar, but it doesn't even have a hint of chocolate, at least in the common sense of chocolate. The flavor otherwise is decent and edible, but I would prefer one of the others if going purely on the name as an indication of taste. Especially if buying a full case of this, I would try to find a single bar locally and give it whirl first."
4,Delicious - and just a bit chewy,"""Trail Mix"" should have been the first two words because I don't really taste much of the chocolate chips, but otherwise this is very good tasting bar. I like most if not all of Pure Bar's products and this one doesn't disappoint: chewy, not too sweet, a little crunch from the seeds and nuts and very nutritious. I wish there had been more chocolate chips but that's just repeating others' observations. Overall, I recommend this and will get it again."
4,a pretty good performance but there's better for the same $,"This budget-priced Naxos release, while being enjoyable in its own way, does not quite measure up to the excellence of some of its competitors - specifically Previn and Maazel - for about the same money. The orchestral playing is fine but does not have the sumptuous tone of its finest rivals; Andrew Mogrelia's tempi are a bit slow and there are some odd sudden changes in tempo and dynamic in individual numbers. For instance, a ratellando is taken in the very opening chord. The documentation is not very thorough or detailed. The 2 CDs are well cued, but no tracking synopsis is provided. The digital recording is very good. This Ukrainian ensemble has had a long and distinguished tradition with Prokofiev, and those who prefer a taut lean sound might find this ideal. I suspect most potential buyers will enjoy this as a supplementary performance. Recommended."
4,Penneys amazing fluidity.,"Rebecca Penneys's playing is a wonder of speed, ease and fluidity. Her interpretations of Mendelssohn and Schubert on this album are wonderful. Particularly noteworthy are the Schubert, Impromptu in C Minor and Medelssohn, Op. 67, No. 4 (the famous ""Spinning Song"").If you are interested in hearing an artist with a uniquely beautiful voice and style, I recommend this album to you."
2,Not what I expected,"While this book provides helpful ideas about projects, I expected and wanted a book that gave hints on preparing your house for sale without spending money. All ideas are in the $100 and up range and are actual construction or other projects. What I was looking for were hints such as: ""To make your closet look bigger, do ____, ____ and ____"" or ""to make your house warm and inviting, light some candles and ""brew"" cinnamon on the stove when you are showing it"""
5,Great deal great clog,"I am personally a Crocs type of person. However when I wear the crocs out to theshops.. my wife and daughter do resent the look.This is really a second best to the ever popular comfortable Crocs.I am told that it will take the shape of the sole of your foot.The built is very nice, and looks classy enough to wear out to the shops.. on theweekend.Thanks to Amazon this is now affordable for us in Australia, where they are retailed ata ridiculous $250."
4,Comfortable - good product.,"It was alittle wide for me, but still received at a good price and timely even though NJ had the widespread devastation due to Sandy. Size was accurate."
5,You can't go wrong with Birkenstock.,"I have planter fasciitis and neuropathy in both feet, and these shoes work wonderfully well. They provide the arch support I need, and the toe box is wide enough that it doesn't cause discomfort."
4,These shoes last forever,"I got a pair of brown Birkenstock Boston clogs back in 2001 in Munich. The pair I got were ""glattleder"" which is just slightly less shiny than patent leather. I've had the rubber sole/out-tread replaced three times, and have resealed the cork around the heel myself once or twice. I shine these with brown polish a few times a year, and that's it. They are still going strong and the leather looks as good as it did the first year I wore them, and they have some serious miles on them. If you buy Birks, take care of them. Replace the treads before they wear through to the cork and condition the leather. Unlike most shoes, they are made to last for years. Oh, and word to the wise, the soles will feel hard as rocks at first. Hold off on the long walks until they are broken in. One they are formed to your feet though they are very comfortable."
1,Birkenstocks???,I don't think these shoes are really birkenstocks. They didn't fit like my others. They were too small and were not near as comfortable.
5,First Birkenstock Clogs,"I am totally satisfied with my new clogs. I have a pair of Birkie sandals I love, and these clogs even top that! They are over the top comfortable, show excellent workmanship, and fit beautifully. I think one of the best parts of Birkenstock, unlike Dansko clogs, is that they come in narrow widths. Warning: If you get a pair, you won't want to wear anything else!!!!"
5,Great fit and looks,"After looking for a great set of comfortable open back shoes, I saw these Birky's on line and decided to order them. Not only are they comfortable and you do not have to point your toes down, so they do not slip off, but great styling for less."
5,Boston Suede Birkenstocks,"I purchased the Boston Suede Birkenstocks in November, 2008 and received the order in 4 days. The Birkenstocks are comfortable as always and I've been wearing them daily since opening the box. I couldn't retire my old Birkenstocks as they have been on my feet most of the day for the last 10 years so I put them back in the closet--they are like old friends. Donna"
5,Just as described,"These shoes are just the same as my last pair that lasted 18 years. Made in Germany, not China! Great price, too."
2,"Too small, too hard","Normally I love 'Boston', but these were too small and the footbed was way too hard. I returned them for a mocha suede softbed."
2,pros and cons,PRO: Really comfortable(according to many people)CON: Very expensiveUgly and will go out of style soon(majority of cons)
5,"I love Birkenstock clogs, and sandals","A year sgo I was suffering with Plantar fasciitis and Metatarsal stress fracture. It took months to heal. My podiatrist made me orthotics that helped some and before that he casted my foot and then the boot. Until I took the chance and ordered Birkenstocks, I suffered. NOW! I wear ONLY Birkenstocks and am pain free.You do have to wear the birkenstock gradually and work up to wearing them all day. Once you have done this, you will have relief like you didn't think was possible.Amazon has the best prices. I have looked, this is fact.Love my Birkenstocks and I hope others buy them. They won't regret it."
2,Runs smaller than the Arizona,"I've worn the Arizona sandals for many years and have always like the fit. However the same size for this clog didn't fit nearly the same. The ridge that supposed to be sitting behind the toes was placed too far forward. Therefore instead of providing support ""behind"" my toes, now they're ""under"" my toes. Unlike a sandal you could only push your feet so far forward because of enclosed nature. Other than that the support is almost identical to the Arizona. If you do order this clog and you're using the Arizona as sizing reference, you may want to try ordering 1 size up. But then again not sure if you will lose the proper arch and heel cup support due to being oversized. Overall, will not recommend. Max 2 stars."
4,This is such a CUTE DVD ...,"I watched this recently .. a friend gave it to me for Xmas as a gag, we've been buddies for over 30 years .. but amazingly, Donny's actually very good and I'd have figured he'd had more videos or DVD's out by now. The part where he duets with himself on ""Go Away Little Girl"" from video taken 30 years ago did kind of bring a mild tear to my eye .. and when my friend and I watched it together, we reminisced about all those years ago being 'crazy in love with Donny Osmond' while watching that piece.Donny seems to have turned into quite the talented performer, very classy and polite. My youngest daughter and I met him a number of years ago and he seemed to be the same when we met him as well."
5,Loved It!,"I love this DVD, loads of songs and he sounds great! He even sang songs from the 70's to the presant. I hope they come out with the Osmands group, that would be great!"
2,Real dissapointment,"Underpowered!!When the machine arrived, we had high hopes given the impressive 3"" wide blade, but due to the lack of power, the machine has seen very little use in the past year. In our shop, the Hitachi has trouble resawing anything wider than about 6 inches and hard woods like maple and white oak just compound the problem. Feed rates need to be kept very low in order to keep the motor from stalling. Most of our resawing is still done on an old 18"" Oliver bandsaw which runs rings around this thing. The only impressive thing about the Hitachi is its price. For the money, this tool has been a real dissapointment."
4,"an accurate cutting , well made resaw","The Hitachi CB75F gets criticized for being under powered and over priced. I agree that this saw is greatly improved by replacing the stock motor with a 5hp 1725rpm motor. As for the price, one only has to look at the 3""x3"" heavy wall tubular steel frame and large shaft/bearing sizes to see its value. It is a great saw for resawing veneers and making accurate stop cuts. There is an optional blade guide for 1/4"" blades, but I would keep the saw set up with the 3"" wide, 1/16"" kerf alternate stelite blade and cut curves with some other dedicated bandsaw. I was very satisfied purchasing the CB75F from Amazon.com and would recommend this saw for resawing and making accurate cuts which could otherwise be dangerous on a tablesaw."
3,"Good, but not what was expected","Beck is a unique artist, and Loser is definitely one of his essential tracks. The record I received was a bit different from what was described as it only had two tracks: Loser and Steal My Body Home. Both tracks sound good, but they are the standard versions of the songs. The price is a little higher than regular 12"" singles but this may reflect the fact that it's billed as an EP (maybe a mixup by the producer?). Nevertheless it is a good buy if you spin or have a combination retro/Beck craving."
4,Good workout... looooonnng opener,"The workout is a good 40 minute routine that I found challenging; however, I just hate the fact you have to navigate through all these warnings, disclaimers and commercials . And you can't just let it run while you do other things, there is a disclaimer that you have to select agree/disagree and certain parts of the opener you cant fast-forward before you get to the main menu. True it is only 5 minutes, but gets irritating after a while. Aside from that its a good workout."
2,abrupt with no real ending,What there was of it was good. It is a very short movie with no real ending that ended abruptly. I paid $5.00 for it at walmart which was too much.
3,I was expecting a little bit more,"The movie gives you a good foundation for ACII. The movie and history are ok, but they could have been better"
5,good,"I'd never heard of it before seeing it on Amazon, enjoyed it although was hoping for more, it is the prequel to Assassin's creed 2."
3,Ordered for my sister.,"I was a little disappointed to learn that this wasn't as much of an original movie as I thought, but she is still happy with it,"
2,If you don't follow the game don't get the movie,"I was very excited when i recieved this video in the mail as i am very much into the AC saga. The movie does have some rough lines and CG is noticable at times. It's not a big screen ""movie"" so it's somewhat expected. i opened the case put the movie in and sat back to relax and watch. I was severly let down when the movie came to an end just over 30 minutes. WARNING if you do not play or know much of anything about the game do not get the movie you will have wasted your money. Grant it the movie is a little behind where the game is but it really dropps you off expecting more. If you do know about and follow the game then dowload the movie for free, borrow it from a friend but i wouldn't pay for it. $8 for 30 minutes of movie it's not worth the money."
3,its a movie,"bought it thinking it was a gaming strategy thing, as a mom i don't know these things. kids seem to think it was ok movie"
1,Micromemo - Nasty Signal to Noise Ration but J&R service is great,"I was very disappointed to find the signal to noise ratio on the Micromemo was terrible - 40dB, akin to a cheap cassette recorder of yester year. Fortunately, when J&R; Music World (who fulfilled the Amazon order as an affiliate supplier) received my poor review, they EMAILed me and were happy to give me a refund! Great service, J&R;!!! They not only proactively look for customer feedback but took the initiative to contact me for a refund - wow! Hopefully, Extreme will eventually fix the engineering problem on the MicroMeo - I now find many others who have had similar problems.Warm Regards, Michael"
2,"Great idea, just falls short ...","This is a great concept to make the iPod more functional. Where it fails is mostly Apple's fault. The battery life is dismal once you hook this device up to the iPod. I can barely get a 2 hour class recorded before it turns itself off. I also froze the iPod twice trying to pause or stop a recording to get more recording time. The actual device fails where it records a huge wav file that has to be converted to a smaller format. This is really a waste of space and time.If you are looking for a good recorder that saves down to an mp3 file very easily and quickly, then go for the Sony ICD-P520 ($50-$60). The software is easy to use and the device will store almost 30 hours at high quality. It works great for recording lectures."
2,it skips every 2 minutes,"when i first used this product i was immediately angered as i realized that my recordings had skips in them almost every 20 seconds, that is to say, i would be reading something and five of the words would be missing. i fumed for two days then tried recording on low quality. that seemed to solve the problem but that was perhaps only because i pressed the pause button every twenty seconds, incidentally there is no difference between high and low quality. but then the problem started back up again though this time at a much less aggravating intensity since it skipped only every two minutes. this is still very painful and damaging since i record poetry recitals almost every week and i also use it to practice foreign languages on a daily basis! the sound quality is barely above acceptable as well."
5,"Voice Recorder Gives Clear, Simple Recording","I've been using this item with a 5th generation video iPod in my classroom. So far, I've recorded several short voice memos with this item that have been posted individually on my website or combined together for a longer podcast posting. The quality, even when set on low, sounds great! Drop-outs are rare to non-existent. Bought this item based on reviews on a reputable Mac-centric website and Amazon, and I don't regret it one bit!"
4,Excellent for moino recording (voice),Products only flaw is not being stereo. Picks up well. does everything expected within that limitation. A stereo mick attached to the extended arm would give it an advantage.
2,Barely usable,The main reason I got this recorder was to record phone conversations of sales calls for my notes at work. I got a RadioShack device that plugs into the phone and then has a jack that goes to a mic. input. The RadioShack device works fine with a tape recorder but with the XtremeMac IPV-MIC-00 MicroMemo Digital Voice Recorder I can hear myself OK (much quieter than I'd like) but the person on the other end is barely audible most of the time. I've tried every possible setting.
1,I've experienced why it was discontinued...,"Initially when I found this item I was so excited that it was so much cheaper and simpler than any other iPod recording device that I ordered it before reading the reviews. Immediately after ordering it I went to close the window and noticed the reviews which highly suggested it would not meet my needs and had significant issues. Within a hour of my order being placed, Amazon would not permit cancellation. I wrote the seller who did not respond until after he'd shipped it. Item arrived the following day and was placed in my mailbox so that I wasn't able to refuse shipment as the seller requested. For the price I figured I'd chance it and see if it just might fit my needs. Unfortunately its junk. After about the third use, it developed a horrible noise during playback of any new recordings. I laughed and told myself.....you get what you pay for!"
3,Good but!!!,"I have owned two Micromemo XtremeMac Mic, I was forced to purchase the 2d mic after the first was stolen. The first mic was spectacular, good broadcast quality sound. But the 2d mic I also use for broadcast has a serious white noise problem that kicks in from time to time on recordings. The white noise usually occurs in wide room environments, but not in open air recordings. It tends to appears in recorded conversations. Above all, the mic is very good, but the fact that I have such hit and miss experience makes the product suspect. I know XtremeMac discontinued the mic, perhaps due to its erratic behavior. Saludos"
4,"good recordings, battery hog","I am a student pastor, and I use this device to record my thoughts in preparation for a sermon. I have also used it to record sermon rehearsals (approx. 15-20 minutes). In these cases it works very well, but after about one hour my iPod battery is very low. Unfortunately, I couldn't imagine using this to record a lecture longer than about 60 minutes.I have the 8GB iPod Classic. To convert the files from WAV to MP3 I use a free downloaded program called Switch (by NCH Swift Sound). It is very easy to use - simply drag the voice memo file from ""My Music"" in iTunes to Switch, and Switch saves as an MP3 in any folder you designate.Again, this is a great product, except for its drain on the battery."
2,I would not read this book to my child,"This modification of the classic tale of the ugly frog turned into a handsome prince lacks the charm of the original tale. It is true that the frog is eventually turned into a handsome prince by the actions of a princess and they live happily ever after. However, the princess made a promise to the frog when he retrieved her golden ball and she had to be commanded to keep that promise. In a fit of frustration she hurls the frog against the wall and it is this action that turns him into a prince.In my opinion, this renders the story inappropriate for children. They are so impressionable that it is not out of the realm of possibility that some child may try the same thing. Also, the princess is a mean person, refusing to even thank the frog for retrieving her golden ball. I would not read this book to my child."
1,Excuse me?,"I was reading this to my child for the first time and actually had to ad lib a new ending, the one in the book is so atrocious. What kind of bratty self indulgent behavior does this teach? In the original story didn't the princess see past the frog's ugliness and kiss him and then find out he was a prince? In this version the princess throws the frog violently against the wall and poof he becomes a prince and marries her. I promptly placed the book in the recycling pile after making up a new ending for our first and only reading."
2,Dreadful - a review of Edith Tarcov's Frog Prince,"I was looking for the classic tale of Frog meets Princess and mistakenly picked up this book. Dreadful.First, although we have liked James Marshall's artwork elsewhere, there's nothing special here. The drawings are simple and generally uninspired.Second. Who thought a rewrite with the princess slamming the frog against the wall was a good idea?!? Not us. In fact, my husband nixed the idea of reading this to our small children after he gave it a preliminary perusal.From the book:That made the princess veryangry.She picked up the frog, andshe threw him against the wall!But when he fell to thefloor; the frog was no longera frog.Note that there is no explanation of why this outburst led to the witches spell being broken. [Perhaps we should slam each other around to see if there's a prince or princess hiding within--lol]Two Stars. So-so art. Not true to the original tale."
1,The worst child book I have ever read,"How does a prince propose marriage to a nasty princess who throws him against the wall after enduring her abuse from the very moment they met, is beyond my comprehension. Why does the princess accepts this offer after so much repulsion toward the frog can only be explained by the prince's new looks after the spell is broken. This book teaches children that beauty is better than values or character and that violence is the solution to problems. I am surprised Scholastic is even publishing this book. Stay away from this book!"
1,Reward for bad behavior,"My first-grader brought this book home from school. I was appalled at the story, as the moral of the story seemed to be that you get rewarded for being mean and shallow. From the other reviewers, you probably read what the plot is. I was very disturbed by the fact that the princess mistreated the frog because he was unattractive, but marries him as soon as she throws him against the wall and he magically transforms into a prince. This is a terrible message for young children, telling them that someone is only worthy if they are either attractive or is a prince. Don't buy this book."
5,What a wonderful player and teacher!,"I had the opportunity a few years ago to work with Katherine Kemler one-on-one. She is truly one of the great players of our time. When I worked with her, she gave me this CD and I loved it right from the beginning. Her playing is very accurate but it's wonderfully musical at the same time. This is the best recording I have heard of Muczynski's Flute Sonata to date. A great buy!"
1,Hmmm...,"The most offensive thing about this CD is not the stiffness of the performances or that the music never takes flight, but the blatant disregard for the score. The most egregious example is the Liebermann Sonata, in which both musicians change notes to accomodate their whim, and the pianist even re-composes the last climactic note in the second movement, dropping the left hand to a ""B"" from the written D#. I have no doubt that these musicians are capable of better and perhaps this recording was created under difficult circumstances of which I'm not aware. Alas, humility should be one's guide in creating a recording; not only in respect to the composer, but in shaping one's own legacy."
3,RHYTHMIC FEAST,"I listened to the ragtime opera ""Treemonisha"" with zest, not having heard it for about 30 years, when I first listened to a broadcast on BBC Radio. The whole performance is very well recorded and the finale, in particular, sums up the strength and poignancy of the story line: the vulnerablility but ultimate determination of Treemonisha, as she leads the crowd in a ragtime dance, and puts in place the men whose superstition and aggresson have tried to outwit her and her companions.My one criticism is the singing of Monisha, Treemonisha's mother. The soprano has far too much vibrato in her voice - I speak as someone who has had voice training. All the other voices seem very balanced in this respect and I feel that the CD is well worth buying."
5,"Frame, Stem & Keel Repair (The Woodenboat Series)","An excellent resource for the novice or DIY boat restorer. Covers the techniques of frame, stem and keel construction, sources of problems, alternative fixes and best methods. Written to be reader-friendly, I found the answers to critical questions on replacing frames v sistering, the pros and cons of each, the concerns for selecting, purchasing and cutting oak stock, fastening, etc. in the first 15 minutes. Pictures support the written word and provide the first-hand guidance you usually find at small boat yards, but here in Maine most are very closed-mouth and are slow to dispense advice (the general response being, ""Well, I suppose you could do it that way.""). I recommend this book to anyone who is now building or repairing a wooden boat and also to those who are considering such a project. Knowledge such as this will either put you well ahead in the project, or take on to other endeavors at a very small investment."
1,Wrongly categorized by Amazon,"This CD is nothing to do with Ed Van Fleet whatsoever, and is listed as such totally erroneously. I cannot find a way to fix it, or advise Amazon to remove it from all associations with Ed Van Fleet.I did not want a CD by Peter Mathers. I wanted one by Ed Van Fleet. If I already had a copy of Mirage, I would have known that it was wrong, but since I did not have one, it didn't occur to me that Amazon's listing would be wrong. It is.Anybody want a used copy of Peter Mathers' Mirage: Visions of Flamenco, real cheap?"
4,A Baby's Diaper Is Cleaner Than This,"Just when you think it couldn't get any dirtier, it does. Cheater Slicks spread their cheeks apart to drop some of their darkest unheard ideas and drag them across your carpet while leaving some of the most unremovable skidmarks of all time. Its really an amzing thing because Lysol can't remove them and neither can low album sales."
2,Not happy,"The can is different than other Lemon Mates I have purchased in the past. It doesn't spray in the same way either and it doesn't smell like it used to. I don't know if the product that was shipped is old, or what. But it smells a little rancid. We are very disappointed, we thought we were getting the same product as before. We love this product but it is hard to find at retail stores. Maybe I'll try a different vendor."
4,Easy set up,I wired this into a Rain Bird controller which uses a normally closed sensor. That's the more common one and therefore no adjustments were needed. It can be switched to normal open if needed. There's an easy adjustment to set the sensitivity; I set mine to 1/4 inch. I installed it on a gutter and ran the wire behind the down spout into the garage. We've only had rain twice but it's done it's job just fine both times. Nothing looks stupider or more wasteful than a watering system running during the rain. For less than $20 every system should have one.
2,Rain Sensor,"This sensor worked well for one year. I will try to return it for replacement, 5 year warranty...................... johan"
4,Gets the job done,"Easy to install, works good although you may still have to manually shut down your sprinklers when it rains plenty in the morning and your systems is set to start in the evenings."
5,Easy install,"I selected this sensor based on the Toro reputation, and the reasonable price, as a replacement for my original no-name sensor. It went into place in less that 10 minutes, and has worked just fine since!"
1,False advertisement,This product is not compatible with all timers so I'm stuck with a product that's collecting dust in the original packagin.
2,Low Price & Low Value Engineering,"Had Hunter, which I was very satisfied with it's functional accessories, however, lasted 14 months ( $100 unit). Wasn't going to spend another $100 for Hunter unit when their reliablity is so poor. Selected cheep Toro. Works alright, but little flexability in programing and no rain sensor terminals. Instructions aren't very clear, but, you can figure them out with trial and error. I don't think there is any manufacturer who makes a reliable sprinkler timer (read; no warrantee past one year). If they were truly producing a quality product, the warrantee period would be, at least, five times longer. You can't buy good, so buy cheap!"
5,Must get.,"Great book, I take it with me everywhere. It is written SO well and I think about the things I read in it during the day because they are just so simple and yet so powerful."
2,USED,THE SHOES WHERE USED BOTTOM SOLES ALL SCRATCHED UP BUT THEY FIT GOOD SO I KEPT THEM. ITS HARD FOR ME TO FIND SIZE 14 SO I SOMETIMES COMPROMISE I SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO AN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT.
2,Sloes or slips?,They look great; but have the slickest soles I have ever come across. I spent the night in the ER the last time I wore them. My ribs still hurt from the fall!
2,Designed for those who don't really want to learn the language,"This book doesn't really give the fundamentals of the language or useful travelling phrases. It begins with content very similar to the CIA world fact book entry for Turkey and proceeds to give approximate english alphabet pronounciations of Turkish rather than explaining the pronounciation and rules of Turkish. These rules are few, vital, and can be explained in a couple of pages as other books do. The phrases chosen are clearly designed for government employees during a conflict; such things as ""I am an American"" and ""I am your friend"" as two of the first seven phrases given. This is followed by such gems as ""Take Cover"" and ""Poison Gas"". None of these phrases are needed in Turkey. This book isn't intended for the civilian traveler or for somebody who really wants to learn Turkish. In the words of another of their phrases ""Watch Out!"""
3,Agree with music fan from East Coast,"Not the best effort from these guys. Some of it sounds like a rehashing of their first two albums (Close to Champaign: a poor man's version of University Blvd.?) I just can't find much to sink my teeth into, except for Jimmy Lester's drumming. And leave the swing stuff to Brian Setzer; he's better suited for it."
2,Disappointing...,"I love this band and their first two albums, but this one is a major disappointment. The mix sounds muddy. And too many of the songs try to be humorous but cross that fine line into cheesy-ness. Case in point -- ""All that Glitters"". Stick with the first two albums and see 'em live, but save your money on this one."
5,surf music for the 90s and beyond,"I just turned 50 years old but I'm not stuck in a ""classic rock"" mode - I love searching out new bands and I'm glad I discovered Los Straitjackets. This is one of the most fun CDs I've purchased in a long time. Great surf music yet their not afraid to experiment - their version of ""My Heart Will Go On"" is a classic. And I never thought I'd hear a surf guitar cover of Benny Goodman's ""Sing Sing Sing"", but it's a killer! And how about that Tijuana Brass inspired track, just without the Brass! All in all, a great CD."
4,Rockin' Music,"I can't see how anyone who already knew Los Straitjackets could end up unhappy with this. I'll admit there's some cheesiness, but what did you expect? Anyone take a look at their album covers? This music is fun and creative. They have a surf and rockabilly influence but dare to go beyond. I find it hard to choose between this album and Viva--both are great."
3,"Interesting diversion.....and oh yes, she's ONLY 35.","I picked up this book at the local library because I'm an Apprentice Addict and was curious to see what Ms C would have to say. As a management major, none of her tips really set my world on fire...although those without mgt training/experience may find some of her thoughts enlightening. The format was nice, an easy read. And yes, she is sensitive about her age, she mentioned it at least four separate times throughout the book. (And please ask her to STOP tucking hair behind her ears--it is much more flattering the way she wore it after the Dove episode in the post-show summary.) What I really wanted to know is how many hours per week does she work, and does she ever get to sleep or have a family life?--esp when I learned she is the mother of two young children. Those answers are not in the book, although she alludes to a ""strong support system"" in the motherhood chapter, this book is like Carolyn herself--all about business."
