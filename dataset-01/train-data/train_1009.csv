1,USELESS,"Not just a waste of money, but especially of time. Author recounts the obvious and there is nothing of substance or of practical use. Seems like author's objective is simply to be published and not to offer readers anything of real value. You can easily learn on your own and spare yourself the dry, generic regurgitation of other people's work. Look elsewhere for the material!"
4,More dark electronic music from the master: Bill Leeb,"If you've grown tired of hearing Bill Leeb's raspy vocals with FLA or wished he would release a FLA album with very few vocals then here is the album you've been waiting for. Honestly this album sounds like FLA outtakes or songs that werent fully developed into FLA songs, but dont take this to be a bad thing, its actually quite the opposite. The music contained on this disc is extremely well done & makes for awesome brooding background music that only gets better & better with multiple listens. If your a fan of this kind of music then this is a must have!"
4,A breath of fresh air,"If you are looking for a breath of fresh air from the mindless dribble of Openwater, or Blair Witch Project...You've found it. INEXCHANGE is a thinking,suspense thriller, about Maury, who is your typical quiet book worm collegestudent who wants to get the beautiful girl, Lara, but no way could he move awayfrom his cell of a dorm room and try to date her... until one night when hemeets someone that will change his life forever by resolving Maury's problemsone, by one. Zack Parker does a great job with his first full length filmbringing the script close to home for a lot of those lonely outcasts. He twistslong slow views, an obvious inspiration from Stanley Kubrick, and bursts ofintense reds and blues with an artsy feel to it. Sean Blodgett (Maury), TiffanyWilson (Lara), and Todd Richard Lewis (Jay) do a phenomenal job acting as well."
3,OK film--- that's all,"Mediocre, passable, forgettable plot with tho twists, largely forgettable characters make for a little better than average film. Includes an extended lion dance segment which always lessens my interest. Includes a tedious almost belabored segment in which a team of heroes does battle with the Golden Formation, a battalion of hundred fighters with shields who perform a series of group formations while battling the heroes. The action picks up gradually. The climactic fights are pretty good, but not enough to make this a must see."
1,This is NOT Supa Robot Maha Baron!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Don't be fooled!!!...this is NOT the Japanese Live Super Robot film Supa Robot Maha Baron...in fact it has NOTHING to do with SUPER ROBOTS at all!!!!! This is merely ANOTHER one of XENON's old school low buget kung fu flicks under the WU TANG label...Sheesh I wish AMAZON would get around to having some sort of DESCRIPTION info for obscure releases such as this... I almost ordered the damn thing based on the other guy's review!!!!!!!!!
3,A crazy kung-fu film,"""Iron Man"" is a Chinese martial arts film with some great action and interesting camera work, but it has the usual bad dubbing, lame soundtrack, clunky Foley sounds, bad editing and incomprehensible plot which plague many Chinese films of this ilk. This film is part of the Wu Tang Collection II put out by Xenon Entertainment Group, Hong Kong Connection and Arena Home Video. The Shaw Brothers may also be involved in this. I bought the video in part because I was intrigued that I could not find a review of it on the Internet. By now, it should be obvious this has nothing to do with the Marvel Comics character soon to become a major movie star."
2,For beginner coaches,"This is a good ""starting"" coaches book for the grade school level. There are NO advanced strategies here. But if you are a new coach, it is a good book to learn the basics."
2,arrived broken,The item arrived in good time but the cd case was completely cracked and broken. The CD worked fine but the case was unusable.
1,Clown act,"This band isn't even a second rate band hell they aren't even a third rate band. This has got to be to the most talentless crap written second only to Nickelback. Seriously a grown man singing about turning the tables on what was obvisously a junior high bully and now ""you're the one who's going down."" Lame. Sounds real tough complaining about being beaten up all the time. If you people wanna listen to real ""hardcore"" music why don't you put down the Disney crap and pick up a real album like something by Lamb of God or Dilinger Escape Plan hell Queen is heavier than Sick Puppies. I feel very sorry for anyone who supports this sham of a band. If you wanna experience something amazing in music you have to get away from the mainstream and Sick Puppies are so mainstream they're music is practically written by the Top 100 billboard itself."
3,Not a bad buy...,"A quality album with a few top notch songs. In a nutshell, however, most of the songs aren't as great as ""All The Same"" -- which is probably what brought the album to your attention in the first place. That being said, at least a couple other tracks such as ""World"" and ""Deliverance"" make it well worth the buy. I wouldn't hesitate to see them live and still recommend the album."
5,My Favorite Album EVER,"I am a huge rock and roll fan spanning from the era of Bob Seger (LOL) all the way to the newly released Shinedown album, ""The Sound of Madness."" I've heard a lot of good albums and I would have to say the depth and magnitude of the Sick Puppies album, ""Dressed Up As Life"" makes it my favorite album to listen to! My buddy at school showed me a few of their songs, and of course I knew the song ""All The Same"" for a while, but was so surprised by the insane nature of the rest of their album! Every song on the album has a different feel and really gets you excited to listen, especially songs like Cancer, My World, and The Bottom! There really isn't a decent song on this album, they are all five-star quality and I would recommend this album and this band to any rock fan out there! I introduced it to all of my friends and they all love the Sick Puppies now! Amazing Album...looking forward to more material."
4,More Sick Puppies!,Excellent..I enjoyed every cut. Not going to compare them to anyone tho a couple of other indie bands spring to mind. Looking forward to hearing more from down-under.
5,Touching...Breathtaking...Heavy...,I've always been a fan of Janet Frame's poetry. This film is an incredible glimpse into a brilliant woman's mind and life. Once you see this film she'll live in your heart forever.I also recomend reading her books. She's got a special gift.I wish this would come out on DVD...!
5,"""Hush...Hush...Hush...""","Writers, take note: Here is a very, very rare example of the creative spirit--and the creative process--captured on film. This story of the formative years of Janet Frame, New Zealand's most celebrated poet and novelist, is fascinating from start to finish.Director Jane Campion's great achievement (aided immeasurably by three marvelous actresses playing Janet Frame at various ages) is to bring to a wide audience a sense of what it is like to be a creative artist. Watch Janet throughout her odd, harrowing, uplifting early years, and you will see the evolution of a true genius, a human sponge who soaks up all her experiences (good and bad) and converts them into gorgeous words. Rarely has a film been able to illustrate this so convincingly.I recommend this film to anyone interested in the nature of genius. But for writers, in particular, it is required viewing."
3,O'l Dirty at it again,"O'l Dirty gets himself in trouble after killing a local bad guy's brother. Seeking revenge the man attempts to kill O'l dirty's closest student, but with no luck. With his new students, O'l dirty attempts to stop the killer once and for all, but it may be harder then it seems. Some pretty good kung fu sequences, and a comedic storyline keep it entertaining. Clif Lok also stars in this film as the young pupil and does a good job."
4,When EEL style strikes!,"A comedic film about a young man who wants to be a bounty hunter decides to bring down a wanted killer. After getting all the other bounty killers killed trying to get the murderer, he decides to take his own chance. After failing once he decides he has to better his kung fu. Finally the young man finds a style that he believes will get the job done once and for all, EEL style. Will it work? Have to find out. and believe me you won't be disapointed at all."
4,Worked great for friends daughter,"My parents used this for me when I was a baby, I used it for my son and I recently bought it for a friend who's daughter was having very bad intestinal problems. Thank you!!! Fast shipping but paid more in shipping then what was on the box. . ."
2,Unimpressed,I don't know if this product actually helped my baby at all. He still had awful gas pains even after taking it. We went through a bottle just to check but I don't think I'll be ordering anymore. I think the BabyBliss we had first worked better in combination with Mylicon drops.
1,contains sodium benzoate!!!,"This is not all natural. It has sodium benzoate, which has been linked to ADHD. I regret already trying this on my daughter."
2,It arrived broken!!!,"The watch arrived broken and not working, had to spend an extra $30 to get it repaired."
3,Beatles... in big band!,Enoch light rearranged the Beatle's hits for his vibrant stereophonic BIG band. This album turns heads of beatles fans and makes some interesting reactions.
3,same old,"nothing too out of the ordinary here.weak lyrics, same 3 power chords, big spikey hair, no musical talent... everything a street punk band should be."
2,Three Listens later...,"I think that this is the weakest punk band I have ever heard. I don't expect much from the ""street punk"" bands that I listen to, but just because the band happens to consist of chicks doesn't exempt them from not knowing how to make music. I would even go as far as saying Crass had more musical talent. That is saying something. What a waste. If you want some good female vox go for Vice Squad, Bikini Kill, or even F-Minus.The only thing I liked was the layout. Colorful hair I suppose, and a neato picture on the waste of a cd."
3,forrest gump,The poster is good but the framing is less than desired. The plexiglas at the top of the frame pokes out beyond the frame instead of mounting underneath.
4,What happens after the 21 days?,"It seems to me that this could be a good kick-start to get you on the road to weight loss but unless you add exercise to the equation and change your eating habits long term, you won't acheive long lasting results.I need motivation for diet and exercise and use this exercise motivation gameThe Fitness Challenge Board Gameto keep me moving."
1,Don't need along with the 21-day Detox book:,This book is not a companion for the Martha Vinyards 21-day Detox diet book. I was fooled into thinking it was.
3,"Come for the cheap horror, stay for the detectives","The movie didn't burn up any top ten horror lists, but it can entertain with the right mix of friends and alcohol. I saw it with a bunch of the cast and crew and the debut screening in IL, and it was a hoot. A schlocky hoot, but look at the cover!One standout: the detective scenes. I thought they were hysterical, with the two detective partners (Brent Douglas and Erik Lindberg) adding a lot of color and relief to what would otherwise just not be a lot of fun.And Joe Estevez! Sure, why not."
5,that's rock'n'roll,"for me this is the greatest rock album for some time! as already has been pointed out, no inventions are found here. simple and plain rock'n'roll, played with great enthusiasm. all four girls are in great shape, but i am especially blown away by the guitar playing. i can't wait to see them live!"
4,PUNK,"The donnas take it off covers all kinds off sounds. You got your punk,pop,and rock. Spend the night shows their influences such as ac/dc from the earlyer rock scene. Take it off is one of the donnas biggest singles reciving lots of radio and video time. If you like their first single take it off then you will enjoy the rest of the cd."
5,The Donnas are superstars,"I have always been a big fan of the Ramones and thought I would never feel as dedicated to another group...then came the Donnas. These girls are superb!! I am 36 years old this music makes me feel so young and energized. The Donnas are not just a fad, there are going to go down in music history. I have heard them compared to the Go Go's, Joan Jett and even Lunachicks. I don't really agree with this, as the Donnas are in a class of their own and what a class that is!!! Buy it...you won't regret it.Try it for yourself: ..."
1,Can someone say '80 srock?,"Listening to the music, it sounds like Great White, Dangerous Toys, Poison, and any other '80s hair band from back in the day. Nothing new to listen to here.To try and compare them to the Ramones, is well..way off, and to call their music 'punk' is also incorrect. This is NOT punk. If you want to call this music punk, you might as well call Motel Crue, or Lita Ford punk.It was fine to listen to once, but like a bad video game, has little replay value. Thankfully, the album was downloaded, and has promptly been removed from my collection."
1,Can't get much worse,"My goodness; I'm pretty open minded when it comes to music, so when I saw this CD, I decided to try it out. It's one of the worst things I've heard in a long time! I could live with the music. But can you get any more stupid with the words?! Apparantly no effort was made to make the lyrics even half way inteligent. Yeah, they rhyme. That's about all you can say about it. Save your money. If you really want to try it out, check your local library so you don't have to waste your money on this piece of crap."
1,Horrible cd...,"I borrowed this cd from a friend. I instantly hated it. Every song is exactly the same. The same lyrics and the same music. There is no creativity whatsoever in this cd. It's all about [stuff]and parties, over and over again. Where's the variety? I honestly don't know how this band has survived this long, if their other cd's are this bad. Don't waste your money. Go buy somthing with actual creativity and talent. I couldn't even take listening to the last 2 tracks. Every song sounded the same. It all just blended into the next song. The whole cd is like one continuous song. This is not what good cd's are all about."
1,Candy Rock,"The Donnas suck along with Liz Phair, Alanis Morissette, Avril Lavigne, Michelle Branch, Sheryl Crow, and Jewel. I like to call this candy pop rock because that's actually what it is. I don't dig'em at all. Real rock/metal is Pantera, Sepultura, Soulfly, Testament, Motorhead, Black Label Society, Godsmack, White Zombie, Rob Zombie, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Killswitch Engage, Arch Enemy, Shadows Fall, Chimaira, Iced Earth, Guns 'N' Roses, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, and KIng Diamond."
4,Punk-pop should be fun. this is what The Donnas is about,"I love how so many people complain about the Donnas when all they've got is pure and fun power-punk from these four girls. Allison is a god when it comes to riffs and solos, the songs lyrics are like the Ramones' songs. How come nobody disses the Ramones for talking about teen love and sniffin' glue? Ha!This album is pure energy-filled rock with awesome guitar work. It's what they promised and delivered.If you want something more elaborated, please tune into Muse or Refused or The Smashing Pumpkins or Pink Floyd. I don't know. These girls stay true to the things they love about rock: loudness and catchy tunes.Get over it."
4,Worth the eleven bucks,"Fans of the first 4 Donnas cds will not be disappointed with their new one, SPEND THE NIGHT. Sure, the lyrics are still consumed by the cliched themes of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll - but what's wrong with that? The guitar riffs are great (as usual), and the overall sound hits you like a punch in the stomach. I love these 4 girls because they epitomize what fun, catchy rock should sound like. If you are looking for deep meanings, buy Radiohead. But if you are looking for fun, then buy an album of the Donnas."
3,good,"The price was great, but due to the scratches I'm unable to play track 9, as it skips. but for the price a error is to be expected I would guess."
3,SOO SORRY GIRLS UR STILL BETTER THEN OTHER BANDS,"IF U WANT TO KNOW OTHR BANDS THAT SUCK ASS THEN LOOK AT MY OTHER REVIEWS, U'LL BE IMPRESSED MAN. THE DONNA'S ARE AT LEAST DECENT. THEY HAVE SOME NICE TUNES GOING ON BUT THEY SHOULD REALLY BREAK OUT INTO MUSIC VIDEOS SO I CAN SEE THEM ON TVS OON. ANYWAY, THEY ARE A GOOD BAND, JUST A BIT TOO REBEL FOR MY TASTE. GOOD BANDOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AND DONT FORGET TO READ MY OTHER REVIEWS FOR BANDS THAT SUUUUUCK"
1,"DOESN""T SOUND LIKE THE DONNAS! MORE LIKE HOLE.","Gone are the catchy clap along type songs blasting boys and being out of money or haveing a curfew , this album is the worst album released this year. I love the Donnas and the first 4 cds are worth going out of your way to buy. This is horrible and it sounds like Hole. Hole is great at being Hole. The Donnas are good being The Donnas. If it wasn't broke they shouldn't have fixed it. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
2,2-1/2 stars -- They drop the same album every year,"I'm not questioning The Donnas' talent, because they do have some, but it's really hard to tell when you can't really tell the difference between this and their other albums. I mean, really - haven't the girls learned yet that there are more topics for songs besides drinking and college-style partying (oops, I'm sorry - their first album was about HIGH SCHOOL-style partying)?And a lot of these songs are style over substance, which is really obvious by just looking at some of the titles alone, like ""Take Me To The Backseat"" and ""You Wanna Get Me High"". And their latest single ""Who Invited You"" is about two-and-a-half minutes long, and it sounds like that's how long it took to write it.There are some good songs on here like ""Take It Off"". Also, the music on the album is really good. But as far as subject matter goes, they seriously need to expand their horizons."
1,Puh-leez!!!,"This is an obvious ... 80's big hair rock but worse, if that's possible. I could barely get past the awful lyrics: ""You're a stain I can't get out/ I tried bleach and I tried Shout!"". Go buy Queens of the Stone Age instead."
1,The drummer rocks,"but the rest of the band bites. Worthless post grunge aggro chick rock. Not to mention some stupid lyrics (""Need yor love 1 2 3, stop staring at my D cup""). ..."
3,Like listening to an hour of the same song,"I bought this CD despite some of the warnings on other reviews that the songs all sounded the same. I thought that maybe people were exaggerating or that it wouldn't matter because I like upbeat rock and roll. After having this CD for a few weeks though, I'm thinking differently. It really is like listening to almost the same song over and over. While I really do like the music and the group, they really did need some variety here. The songs are all the same exact tempo, and they all talk about the same things (partying, drinking, etc).After listening to the disc twice (on two separate occasions, not in a row), I am already tired of listening to it, and probably won't for a long, long while. I'll be honest though, it would be a great CD to listen to if you're going on a long drive. I gave it three stars because I really do think the music's great, it just got too boring to listen to after a couple times through."
3,Not great,"I remember reading that one of the Donnas said if they just slowed their songs down they'd be more popular. Well, they did it and it worked. They're all over Tv and all the little girls are snapping up their records, but the music kinda [...]. Other people are saying exactly what I think: predictable. All the songs sound the same. And not much fun. Get rid of that girl was a fun song. [...]I like some of the song titles,[...]"
2,Hmmmm,"Yes, it makes your toe tap. Yes, it's like a cross between AC/DC and the Ramones. Yes, that stuff was much better in it's original form. Delete, move on."
4,"Good music, lyrics need work","I own the CD.They remind me of Joan Jett.The tunes are good, though I find the simple repetitive drumming annoying.I love the singer's voice. I just wish they didn't have so many refernces to drinking. I fear some trips to rehab are in the future for these party babes."
4,Great CD,I don't know what that one guy's talking about....I'm listening to it on my computer's Cd drive right now!
4,Don't Just Spend The Night,"""Spend The Night"" is another fun-filled album from these girls. They really are a talented young group of women, and are finally being recognized for that!This album is chock full of 13 fun tracks to rock out to. Among my favorites are: ""Take It Off,"" ""Dirty Denim,"" and ""You Wanna Get Me High"". It was hard to pick a few songs that I liked the best, as I think the whole album is really great!I definitely recommend picking this album up. I promise you won't just want to spend the night with this album; you'll be listening to it a whole lot more than that!"
3,"They should ""Take It Off"".","This is a pretty good disc, and probably their best overall. The whole album is very consistent, meaning it all sounds the same, but what do you expect. Lyrically it sounds like they just got out of high school (which they probably have), but I guess that's the point judging by the cover. Alot of the songs do suggest that they'd like to ""Spend The Night"", which would be fine with me, especially the singer. But anyway, though this isn't real deep, it is fun, and they do rock. In fact they might be the most rockin' chick band around. Oh wait, that's ""L7""."
5,Remember when rock was fun?,"A perfect rock album. Yep, these four girls, using the standard ""bass, guitars, drums and vocals"" rock instrumentation, singing simple, fresh, often naughty lyrics and slashing away with huge power chords and twisty solos...mostly at breakneck tempos...have crafted an outstanding rock album...rock with a capital ""R"", ""A"", ""W"" and ""K"".It's a fun listen. You'll smile while pumping your fist and flailing away on your air guitar.The single ""Take It Off"" gives you a good idea of the record...if you like it, you'll totally enjoy the rest of the album.But, there's hardly any tunes I skip now...it's maddeningly catchy.Check out these up and coming bands now...The Ataris, The Androids, The Exies...and The Donnas. All tuneful, driving, great rock...this is a great time to be listening to this type of music. Too bad radio/MTV hasn't picked up on all this good stuff. I've had enough of hip hop and rap metal..."
4,very good cd,"its a great CD. I like theiir type of music and they're girls. They're one of the few bands i listen to that include girls. but anyway, the topics of the songs are kinda similar but i promise it never gets boring. u can listen to it all day and all night."
2,musical tofu rocks at first - less filling as time goes on,"Let me say this record is the first I've heard of the Donnas. As a 30 year old, it takes alot to get me excited musically now. The Donnas at first accomplished that. Not only by thier swagger, but in your face rockin' style. That was at first. I also loved to see women rock.After having the record for six months. A few observations.- great style, although lack of diversity and depth is glaring. Really really hurts the record.- songs almost all the same tempo- the sexual themes get boring after awhileSo after having alot of excitement at first now this disc is resigned to my CD carousel. I haven't played it in two months.Seems they have become the MTV darlings which isn't such a great thing. Music industry hype has grated on me since the days of Nirvana.Overall, interesting band. However, time has revealed Spend The Night to not be as exciting as I once thought."
5,THE RETURN OF REAL ROCK!,"Being in an all female band as well, I know what its like to rock hard and the Donnas to just that on ""Spend the Night."" With heavy guitar rock sounding the The Runaways and The Pandoras, they truly have talent that surpasses any of the posers out there. They have fun lyrics, excellent music and a positive attitude. They write their own songs, play instruments and are not afraid to admit they like to party. This time the guys are the objects in the songs, a nice twist I must say. The girls are back in town, I feel the Donnas are wonderful role models and are helping to get more real women rockers into the music industry! Play on and I can't wait to see them live!Listen to the Donnas!..."
3,"OK, but not the greatest","I recently listened to this CD and thought it was awesome - much better than the artificially produced stuff you hear on the radio these days. A great punk revival. It has a great rock sound and the girls know how to play! Problem is that they try too hard to copy the Ramones. They need to get some originality in their music and lyrics. It seems like the same song multiplied 13 times (the number of tracks on the CD). Though I like the music a lot, and wish the band well, they do need to increase the creativity of their lyrics. Good job so far, and hope it gets better. We need more of this on the radio! Just a little bit of improvement and this band will be dynamite!"
3,Donnas take it mainstream,"I've been a fan of the Donna's since I heard thier first album.Whenever I mentioned The Donnas to anybody they were like ""who?!"" Each album they released showed a bit more maturity and growth as a band.This album is good, but I get the feeling they are trying to make it big with it - and they are trying too hard. As though they have been laying low until the demise of Britney Spears and the likes got washed up and now that girl rock is coming back, ie Avril Lavigne, Michelle Branch, and now the Donnas will try and try to get to be household names and then get [weak] and break up... This album isn't thier best but it is worth listening to."
5,BEST EVER FROM THE DONNAS,"Let me just get straight to the point: this is the best cd the Donnas have ever done. After I heard it, I thought,""wow the Donnas have grown up"". The song themes are the same as always, but the music really kicks some serious butt, and every single song is way above average. This cd is such a progression from the last 4 albums...they just sound ten times bigger & better. The previous albums were all good, but this is the one that should put them in the big league. It's hard to pick favorites here, but a few of mine are ""it's on the rocks"", ""dirty denim"" & ""who invited you?"". If you are a fan of the Donnas, this is a MUST HAVE, or if you just like girl rock bands, go out & buy this cd... you won't be disappointed."
2,Sub par musicians.,"A guy at work has a couple of the donnas cds and he made me listen to Spend The Night. I was bored with no other music so I've tried to listen through the CD several times, and I have.This is low quality music. I give it 2 stars because one or two of the songs are ok, but the rest makes me think that the donnas are only popular because they are 4 women, and that's fairly novel. Musically they are incredibly monotonous, and not very skilled. Almost to a one, all of their songs sound the same. Here is the basic recipe:Fast hard drums + simple chords blasted out on the guitar + the lead singer doing her best impression of a real vocalist = any song on this CD.If they got one thing right on this CD, it's that their music is incredibly generic, and almost a perfect distillation of soulless rock. Their music is white noise, and terribly forgettable."
3,The lyrics suck,"I heard this record for the first time and it just reminded me of lillix but better. its good music, most of the time, but the lyrics are so bad you just have to tune them out. theyre pretty good musicians, but i expected better from them. i read an article where they were complaining that everyone thinks that some guy writes their songs for them, but i think theyd be better off if they didnt write there own stuff. oh and btw all the songs sound the same, except for the singles."
2,A Mediocre Girl Band,"if i could i'd give this cd a 2.5 but i can't so i rounded down.i bought this cd because i heard some good things about the donnas and thought ""take it off"" was a good song. also, there aren't many girls that make it big in the rock industry today. i felt they would be worth a try so i bought the cd, took it home, listened to it, but was disappointed.in my opinion, the songs are too short and lack in substance. most of them are between 2 to 3 minutes long. i just didn't find anything special or great in the songs. the donnas are just a mediocre girl band. they just aren't all that. i read a review saying that this was their best album yet. if that's true then i wouldn't recommend their other albums either.i don't want to hear stupid songs that have no point. just because the lyrics of a song rhyme, doesn't mean it's good. this cd was a waste of my money. i hope the donnas come up with better material than this. when will their be a great girl band?"
3,A Let Down...,"While I believe The Donnas to be bold and talented, this CD lacks skillful songwriting and diversity. Every song sounds exactly like the last. I might change my mind if I were to see them live, but I have a hard time listening to this CD all the way through. It has not met my expectations."
3,Not too bad,"The CD was pretty good, all the songs were up beat and fun to listen to. The lyrics were about girls' experience and having a good time. The downside to it was that all their songs sounded almost exactly the same. I had a really hard tome tell the songs apart, unless I listened to the lyrics for a while."
4,"Geez, You guys have the Donnas all wrong","I've known about the Donnas since 1999. They were known then to be ""young female Ramones"". Most of their fans were punk/ indie rock fans. They were almost kitchy. Then last week I saw them on MTV! What a shock. It's like seeing Henry Rollins play cameos in movies. But its good they are getting more well known and I hope they become famous and foster change. But please don't compare them to either Kiss, hair metal bands or god forbid TRL stuff. I guess they are pretty enough to be on TRL, but they definitely come from a more thoughtful background, but they do rock. By the way, donna means ""woman"" in Italian."
3,I want The (old) Donnas back!...,"I agree that it seems like The Donnas Are trying to hard to become more mainstream. I've liked them for a couple of years now, and this album seems like they are really changing for some reason. It might be a producer or something, but I want The (old) Donnas back!..."
1,Warning! Copy-protected CD will not play in PC CD Drive,"To date, I have loved everything I've heard from The Donnas. They're cool, catchy, heavy rock and roll that stands in league with the Ramones and the Runaways. HOWEVER, this disc is enhanced with copy-protection that makes it UNPLAYABLE in a PC CD-RW drive. I don't know if all runs share this ""feature"" but the copy I bought this weekend at my local Best Buy is useless to me, as I listen to 90%+ of my tunes at work on my computer. 5 stars for the songs, minus 4 for the ""enhancement"". Let the buyer beware!Minor update: Since posting this, I have heard others claim it works for them in their Windows machines, but it does not work in either of my machines, one Windows XP with a CD-RW and the other Linux with a DVD/CD-RW combo drive."
2,rock on? right...,"I'm confused - The Donnas changed their names to honor the Ramones but can't rock out [very well]. I was listening to ""Take it off"" and thought, ""what IS this?"" Bad, very bad..."
1,Is this a real band??,"Sounds like girls yelling, not saying much. The words you cant just understand! I bought this for my friend, and we hated it.. It wasn't good. Beware!"
4,"Excellent adventure, a must for Sophie Marceau fans!","This film is originally titled ""La Fille De D'Artagnan"", which translates to D'Artagnan's Daughter. Sophie Marceau plays a headstrong young Eloise, the daughter of one of the famous three muskateers, now retired and making a living teaching fencing. Eloise uncovers a plot to overthrow the king when the convent where she is living is attacked by soldiers - and she sets off to make things right, with or without her father's help. Full of humor, great swordfights (Sophie performs her own fencing), and excellent cinematography, this is a really supurb adventure movie. There is some violence and nuditity, this is not a movie for children, but it is a very enjoyable film for adults."
3,Fun Movie with a Special Treat,"Revenge of the Musketeers is an enjoyable movie to watch. Typical swashbuckler. The special treat is that this is one of the few movies I've ever found where Sophie Marceau does a nude scene! The scene is very tasteful and very, very funny and so appropriate for the movie. If you're a Three Musketeers fan at all, I think you'll enjoy this movie."
3,ok,"i didn't realize that the show was sub-titled. this is normally okay, but not in the venue i was watching it"
5,BEWARE,This film in England is called D'Artagnan's DaughterSo beware you don't order the same film twice.Great film under any name .Nice print
3,"OK, nothing great","I collect a lot of ""swashbuckling"" movies and considering the cast and the subject matter, I guess this was a required addition.It was enjoyable enough and Sophie Marceau's visual charms are not to be ignored. However, pacing-wise and fight choreography-wise, I expected more from a French team. Compared to a couple of my recent acquisitions: Le Bossu and Cyrano de Bergerac (w/Depardieu), it's really not in the same league.A pleasant enough diversion, but not really a keeper."
3,French with subtitles,"Contrary to what you would believe from seeing the jacket and reading the editorial review, this movie is only in French but with English subtitles. If you don't speak French, forget about it. If you're learning French, the subtitles are really useful. It seems to be a fun, well done movie, although Sophie Marceau should have been taught to fence."
3,Nooed to find thedevice to play,It hard to find the device to convert vcd format to small size DVD . Hope to find easy way and place to convert those video image.
5,Nice paddle,Nice paddle for the price. I mean you can spend depending on the level of your skill set but for the beginners it seems great. it lacks little spin but that is fine as i was not a pro.
4,great starter paddle,"not much on speed, but great for defense good paddle when you begin to up your game well worth it for the price"
5,Unique Material makes a great book,"I compared this book to many othres while buying it and what impressed me the most is that this book contains a lot of unique material, which simply isn't in any other game/dev math books or any other books I've seen before for that mater. It's well explained and very diffrent than what you would expect from a math book. Strongly recommend!"
2,Good Topic Range- Obtuse Explanations,"I found this book thoroughly frustrating.I assumed that a book with ""for Game Developers"" would make concepts easier to understand for the less mathematically inclined in this world. Quite the oppposite, I found my Calculus textbook explained vectors much easier.He spends very little time actually explaining the concepts instead opts to throw formulas at the reader. Understandably, formulas are necessary to be mathematically concise, but he could at least spend time discussing them. Now I could forgive him his obtuse explanations if I had a set of practice problems to work with, but there are none. I wasn't even aware of the calculation errors until I read the other reviews, so this only lowers my esteem for the author.Now to be fair, I haven't gotten to many of the later topics, so it's possible the book will get better. The few I have looked at, however, do not lend me to such optimism. Purchase at your own risk."
2,Just for brains.......not for laughs!!,To me....it's reminds me of chess. ALOT of stradegy. Alot of what does what. You have to be about brainy games. This is not a parchisi or even a memory game. Relax.....NOT....but if if you want a real challenge thewn this will test even yourself. If you love the thought with chess then I would love to see your reviews since I am not a chess fan. I thought it was very different.
3,A light afternoon read,"Sidney Middleton lives in the small English village of Taviscombe and is liked and respected by all his neighbors and acquaintances. We learn how nice he is as the residents talk about how his domineering son David is trying to place him in a retirement home far from the village. The villagers are shocked one morning to learn that Mr. Middleton has died because of carbon monoxide poisoning.Through the eyes of the Mrs. Malory we learn that his death was not an accident, but a deliberate act. And the deeper she looks into the matter, the more suspects that start to become apparent. All the suspects are likeable and it turns out that the villagers learn that Sidney Middleton ruined many people's lives.All the characters in this small English village are believable and brought to full life with the authors fine writing. It is what makes this murder mystery worth reading."
3,A good cozy.,"Cozies are not my preferred genre, but I read this, as it was one of our Mystery Group's selections. While the pace and the abundance of daily-live detail is something to which I am not accustomed, I found the plot to be quite good and definitely appreciated the idea of people not being as they seem. Mrs. Malory is not cloying or a busybody. For cozy fans, I recommend it."
4,Mrs Malory and the Silent Killer,it is always entertaining for me to read a Mrs. Malory story. I like the insights on life in the UK.
3,eh...,The movie started out pretty good. Its obvious this was extremely low budget (my hand held cam has better video quality then their's) and that they could only afford 3 real actors.. but despite all that it was alright. There were about 2 or 3 scenes that were generally creepy (the camera/knife scene was a good one) but i can't honestly say this movie could become an independent classic. i'd reccomend checking out Ghosts of Edendale if you liked this movie.
1,WHY?,"It would be very time consuming to get into all the reasons why I wish I hadn't bought, let alone, watched this DVD. Everything that you could possibly attribute to a bad movie was present....bad plot, horrible acting, pathetic character developement. For me, this movie was right on par with ""The Blair Witch Project"". If you have absolutely nothing else in life to do for about 90 minutes, find something other than this movie to occupy that void. And, if you don't feel like taking my warning....feel free to buy my copy."
3,David A. Cross writes a fair review,"Even though he made it, he's right, it's about 3 stars. Put it basically, it has original plot and some really creepy parts. But it was held back by its low budget, no doubt about it. So if you need the giant effects, steer clear. But if your a big time horror fan, don't miss it."
1,Aaaaaaaahahaha,"I was seriously expecting this movie to challenge Orange County, Men in Black II, and Goldmember as the best comedy picture of 2002. I was so impressed, in fact, that I did background research on the main characters. To my surprise, I found that none of them have been in any movies besides this one. I couldnt understand why, when all of a sudden I thought to myself, ""ooooh yeah, they sucked ass!"" The blonde chick spends half the movie running away from a ghost who doesnt even threaten her. One time, he just looks her in the eye and touches her arm like a gentleman, and she gets all riled up. The ghost is the most famous character in the movie, becuz he was the same blue dude in the Dell PC commercials, where he looked just as goofy. I heard a rumor that he's gonna be in the upcoming Smurfs movie as well. At least he has somewhat of a future."
1,"A sad, sad disappointment","This film was so bad it would put insomniacs to sleep. Nothing but a cheesy horror flick - if it can even be considered that.. whoever directed this film has created a new genre of this world, something so awful it can't be described. Please save yourself the money and don't bother even RENTING this film, unless poor acting, lame special effects and quite possibly the worst story line made appeal to you."
1,Rent this FIRST,"This movie is HORRIBLE! If you give this movie a good review that's probably because you work in the advertising department for the production company. This movie does not even deserve a B raiting, C if there is such a thing. After seeing this movie I have decided that I can direct a movie. I wouldn't even use this DVD for a table coaster. I'm not gonna waist my time telling you what the movie is about, RENT FIRST!"
3,A Nice Suprise,"I have to admit that my expectations weren't high when I rented this movie, but I found it to be an entertaining film. While you can tell it didn't have the typical Hollywood ""Spit shine polished"" look to it, it did have an over all creepiness that made up for the flash and glitz. Then again what do I know, cause I believe ""Tourist Trap"" is one of the all-time great horror movies."
3,Not too bad,"For a low budget feature, it has a decent plot and some basic effects. Nothing superior, but better than your average straight to Sci-Fi Channel flick. Give it a rent and you won't be disappointed.A couple of genuinely creepy moments and some funny lines. A few unintentionally funny moments, but overall I liked it. The DVD even has a few secent extras."
1,Not much more than a ghost of an idea...,"This probably looked really good on paper. An agoraphobic girl finds out that she's living in a haunted house. I guess that's one way of solving the age-old question for haunted house movies, ""Why don't they just leave?"" The problem is that the protagonist is completely unengaging. I don't know any agoraphobics. Well, I guess I wouldn't, would I? But it does make it pretty difficult to relate to your main character when she's kinda crazy to begin with. That, on top of the poor video quality and the fact that it quickly turns into a run of the mill haunted house story make it a misfire. It just goes to show you, and interesting tagline doesn't necessarily make an interesting movie."
1,Made me numb with disbelief...,"I wasted two hours of my life watching this drivel,hoping to find a shred of likeability,but it never happened.The ""acting"" is atrocious.Seriously. This would be a great ""mistie'd"" movie because there are so many things to make fun of.I'm sure the young actors gave it their collective best,but the entire undertaking sucked from the beginning."
3,A Ghostly Revenge Story,"This movie lacks the budget that you need for a big time scary hit, but that doesn't stop it from being a really good horror film. It deals with a young girl who is afraid to go outside and leave her apartment, because she was stalked by a man 1 year ago. The man also killed her parents and brother. She fears that her apartment may have a ghost in it! So she finds a girl on the net that specializes in ghost hunting. I don't want to tell you any more than that. There are some twists to the story as well. If you like horror movies dealing with ghosts, you should enjoy this movie!"
3,ok movie,"Yeah, the actors went the best but it sure scared the hell out of me watching it the first time... even the second and third... i would totally rent it first tho... its a really good movie to watch on a dark stormy night and get the hell scared out of you."
3,COULD have been a great movie,"I have seen every horror movie ever filmed (well, most). Low budget and high; this film had a great plot, some pretty surprizing acting, and if a a bit more money had been spent, it would have been rated up there with Evil Dead. It made me jump a few times, especially the basement scene. The reason I only gave 3 stars was because of tacky filming. At first I thought it was a student film because of the amateurish work, but the plot and acting made it well worth the time to watch."
3,I have liked her others better.,Plot was a bit of a stretch as well as the extent to which the female protagonist becomes a different person after the amnesia.
1,"more a ""booby trap"" than a mooning....","let's see-you're a single dad whose wife died recently, leaving you with a infant daughter.You own a diner, late one night you find an injured woman asleep in the bathroom. You lay her unconscienous on the couch in back and continue to clean-you hear your baby cry, then abruptly stop-you race in the back and there is injured unknown woman BREASTFEEDING your daughter-saying glad to be home with my baby, and you, my husband.What do you do-well, bring her home and fall in love with her, of course. NOPE, wrong answer!Only in a badly written romance would a man do this, instead of what is the logical answer-get your kid from the crazy lady and call the cops!I won't bore you with the rest-it just gets better from there.Do not bother with this book.No stars!"
2,thought I was ordering a cd,"I thought I was ordering a cd, so imagine my surprise when I saw the dvd. I like the songs, but wish it had been a cd."
5,Jason Crabb Live-The song lives on,"Great DVD, Jason Crabb is just a great singer. What a story, An experience to watch his growth and singing abilities."
5,Take a ride to the smarter side,"This is a great book. Warner in this book does a great job of explaining of how streetcars allowed the development of Boston to unfold. The main thesis is that this form of mass transit allowed people to move away from the city and commute into work, but unlike before it was not only the wealthy who could accomplish this. Rather, it was the working class that could do this as well. The end result would be that the city would be built out and that the infastructure needed to maintain the city's vitality would follow as well. This would lead to the development of districts and bands of housing that would separate individuals from one another through residential segregation. The book is easily read and enjoyable in spite of its subject matter."
5,Good episode. But cant save it.,I bought this but I hate that I can't save it on my Computer. Unless I just don't know how too?
4,RTS game for people that don't always like RTS games,"World in Conflict is the ultimate game for people that don't call themselves ""real-time strategy"" (RTS) fans, but would like to dip their toe in and experience the game. Unlike most RTS games, you aren't tasked with building a base or gathering resources--instead, you given ""command points"" from the outset, and your sole focus in the game is to out-think and out-maneuver your Russian foes in glorious combat.The game also comes with a surprisingly poignant story, as well as some very slick multiplayer options. Aside from camera issues and over-reliance on tanks in the single-player, (though they do have campaigns that specifically make you use all four of the different types of units) this is a great RTS game to dive head first into."
3,Not as accomplished as Elyria,"Being a die-hard Faith in the Muse fan, I was dying to love this. Their live presence is hypnotic, Elyria was a masterpiece, and Annwyn's Cantus gave me hope that they would at last be seen as one of the finest ""goth"" bands still out there. Sadly, however, they seem to be running out of steam. Granted, Importune Me No More is lush and vivid, and Patience Worth is beautiful. William Faith brings us another generous trove of morose guitar riffs that hearken back to the Christian Death era. So why doesn't this come together? I think it's simply a lack of passion. Nowhere here will you find the pleading, poetic sorrow of a Vervain or a Sparks, and every song virtually bleeds with unfulfilled promise. It's not a bad disc, but if you've already enjoyed the first two, you will be disappointed."
3,"Only moderate ""Evidence of Heaven"" to be found here.","Once upon a time, I fell in love with a group. After many years of searching for evidence of their continued existence, I stumbled upon ""Evidence of Heaven."" Unfortunately, this album does not possess the same degree of charm as its predecessor. On the whole, I had to rank the album as fair, but there are indeed jewels among the hubris. ""Importune Me No More"" had that ethereal flair that I was so enthralled by so many years ago. Far from being a ""Goth"" myself, I would imagine a large portion of this CD would appeal to those who would label themselves thus -- heavy moroseness & leaden vocals by Wiliam Faith. It is Monica Richards who rescues this CD with her other-wordly voice that could haunt even the most mundane."
4,Great!,"If you have always wanted to get the Drizzt stories but can't stand Salvatore's writing style this is the way to go. Great art, great story, fun dialogue. All in one quick to read package. Put it on your summer reading list, or if your a comic geek that is tired of the Fantasy genre being ignored by the big two."
3,not sure yet,First..... I am not sure of this yet. My mom is a hosta freak. She has a hosta garden. I seen the color of this one. She didn't have it. The problem is.... Its not that color. I was really disappointed. My mom said it will never be the color shown. They say shade and sun will make a difference. She still loves it. I also bought 2. I have 1 partly in sun. and I have 1 in the shade. They came in excellent shape. They have grown almost an inch since I planted them. About a week. Only time will tell what final color they will be. I will update next month from now.
3,too small,"this is an okay merchandise but when i opened it i expected it to be at least a little bigger, i would not recommend this to anyone else it was too much money for the size of it"
4,ard-boiled right down to its bones,"Hard-boiled right down to its bones. ""Cry Danger"" doesn't quite make the grade a a great film but it is a really fun hard-boiled melodrama with snappy hard-boiled dialog. The wry off-hand wit of the often terse dialog and the brisk pacing propel the story through the film's hour and twenty minute running time without much chance for the audience's interest to lag."
4,Great Step-ladder for Gimps,For gimpy bi-pods whose balancing abilities are greatly diminished this product is a necessity. The extended bar in front enables one to change overhead light bulbs or replace batteries in smoke detectors without risking taking a header.I wish it were built sturdier. I haven't had my step ladder long enough to know if it will hold up for months or years.
1,Don't waste your money on this ladder!,"We thought this would be the perfect ladder for our needs. However when it arrived it was missing a part, unstable, poorly made and not packaged well for shipping. We couldn't even return it because we couldn't re-package the ladder in its original wrapping. Do not waste your money on this ladder. Go to Home Depot and get a better and cheaper ladder instead like we did."
2,Only for real fans,"Scorpions could have done a real interesting unplugged album but they sure kept things on the safe side. Even if they do ""The zoo"", ""Catch your train"" and ""Rock you like a hurricane"", the chosen material is mostly ballads. And the thing is that it's not exciting to hear versions that are so close to the original. Of the mentioned rock tunes, ""Catch your train"" is the only one that works, ""Rock you like a hurricane"" and ""The zoo"" is rather boring. What might be a treat is that Scorpions play a couple of covers (like Kansas' ""Dust in the wind"" and Queen's ""Love of my life"") but the original versions are a whole lot better. This album is only for those who are really into Scorpions."
1,Unhappy Customer,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY PRODUCT AND IT HAS BEEN A MONTH - I AM A VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!!!!!!
1,Watered down drivel.,All these song belong on light rock radio. The Scorpions hit a low with this one. Skip it or borrow it from a friend.
4,plenty of examples,This book is certainly useful for any students attempting a project on ASP.NET coz it provides many examples. It's very handy when I used it for my teaching too.
3,Just part of the overall ASP.NET picture,"I ended up using Visual Studio Web Developer Express. This book does have it's place on any .NET software developers bookshelf, if only as a reference. Look at the Head First books from O'Reilly."
1,"Burns gums, leaves teeth with white spots","Works to a certain extent, but not really. It burns my gums and leaves my teeth with what looks like fluoride white spots. Do not recommend."
2,not so great,I'm sure these make your teeth whiter but the are very uncomfortable and you pretty much drool the whole 45 min you have them in.
1,Poor product,"I tried this product today and was very disappointed. The trays were flimsy, would not stay in place, and the whitening liquid foamed into my mouth. It was a very unconfortable and unpleasant experience, and I could not tolerate the trays beyond 20 min (suggested time was 45 min). This was disappointing because I had hoped for an improvement over the typical strips. The price was also high for a product that will now go into the garbage. I think I will go back to the strips and avoid Aquafresh products in general after this experience."
1,Disappointed,The gel in the trays does not stay in place. Within 5 minutes of having them in my mouth the gel had slipped out and was dripping everywhere. The bottom tray was especially bad. Not sure how well they whiten because they don't stay in place long enough to do any good. I would not recommend using these.
2,Not Satisfied,"I used this product for a week straight. I used it at the same time every night, and brushed my teeth prior to use just to make sure it was actually whitening my teeth and not food residue. I also took pictures prior to each use to see the progress. My upper teeth whitened slightly (mind you, my teeth were not even very yellow or discolored to begin with), but it did not whiten my bottom teeth at all, at least not noticeably enough. Also, the gel always stayed in the upper tray, but always leaked out of the bottom tray which is why I think it didn't work. I was not satisfied and feel like I just wasted $35 and people will not even notice a difference."
1,The worst - DON'T Waste your time or money!!!,"Over the last couple of years I have tried several teeth whitening products and this was by far not only the worst, but the most painful! It rubbed my gums to the point of bleeding and the ""Trays"" did not do as good a job as the Crest White Strips. I have tried to contact Aqua Fresh, but after two phone calls the third number I was referred to was closed for the day. If you are looking for whiter teeth, try the Crest strips or if you use a tanning bed, Twighlight Teeth work much better."
4,No hassles,"This product frames your teeth and stays in place with a mold...not a strip. The only negative...it takes about 30 minutes. However, the results are astronomical! I have the whitest teeth ever! I've tried other products, but this one is the most reliable."
3,white and painful!,"After randomly deciding to whiten my teeth, my friend and I grabbed white trays. However, we should have read some reviews.I am on my last day as we speak, and my gums are ON FIRE.For the first 5 days, it all went fine.Although the gel is very uncomfortable, and comes out of the trays into your mouth frequently.For the last 2 days however, my gums have been bleeding and very very sensitive.PROS:White teeth.Well fitting tray.CONS:Bleeding gums, painful gums. Hurts to brush teeth.Loose gel."
2,Whiten your teeth..... and your gums.....,"Things seemed well with these the first three days of use. They weren't horrible. They didn't fit very well but I really did feel like they worked good. I can tell after 4 days my teeth are very white! However, today I had an interesting experience that I hadn't had before. My gums were burning while I had them on. I took them off early (after only 25 minutes) because I couldn't take the burning anymore. When I took them off I looked in the mirror and my bottom gums were sore, swolen, and WHITER than my teeth! UGH! They still hurt a few hours later. I probably will not use these ever again, nor will I recommend them to anyone! I think I'll stick with whitening strips!!!"
4,White Trays,"As I am writing this I am wearing the trays for the first time. My first impression: these are so much better than Crest White Strips! With the strips, the gel would oose out, make my mouth foamy, slip around all over, and made my teeth hurt very badly. The trays don't oose and they stay in place very well. I'm not sure about the sensitivity yet, I'm sure there will be some, but I am using Sensodyne so I am hoping that will help as well as doing right before I go to sleep so hopefully any pain will be gone by the time I wake up. I'll type up another when I have finished the treatment. :)"
4,i allways had an almost white smile.,"but now after I've used the product it looks so nice and natural. so good job. only thing i didn't like about the product , in day 2 it was in my mouth the kit and after about 30 minutes i got a sharp pain in my tooth i spit what ever chemical that's in it out and was relived to know that after a few moments the pain went away. the days after that I've decided not to push the time and after 20-25 minutes i removed it and it was enough for me. but happy with the end result and now about 2-3 weeks after still looking good and no pain or sensitivity."
1,wish I wouldn't have used it,"I didn't really notice an overall dramatic whitening, but now I have very very white spots on my teeth. The gel sits in the bottom of the trays and you have to squish it to get it to cover up to the gumline. It was very hard for me to get an even distribution and now I have very noticeable white spots along the line where most of the gel sits at the bottom of the tray. Now I have to figure out what to do to fix the white spots! (it says in the package that they are temporary, but these have lasted for days)."
1,Burned by Aquafrsh,"This is not a fluke/ I just got my baces off and wanted to whiten my teeth the over the counter way before shelling out Big $$$. After the 2nd treatment I noticed burning in the gums and much sensitivity with brushing. After looking closely at my gums, they were peeling where they come to a point between the front teeth. The trays don't even cover my average size canine teeth, so the bottoms are more discolored then the whitened tops now.My wife is also using the product too, and shared with me that she is experiencing the same burning and skin peeling.I will be calling the company! The instructions are very vague.Your tags: aquafresh white trays, teeth whitening, whitening, oral hygiene, white strips"
2,Very Disappointing,"I'am generally very satisfied with all of the aquafresh toothpaste brands. In fact all I use is aquafresh toothpaste. When I got these trays, I was excited. Their website along with their commercials portrayed a seamless and easy non-messy application of this product. Boy is that deceiving. Not only can you not talk with the trays in your mouth but the gel literally spills all over the place once in your mouth. It's not disgusting but annoying. It is however pretty effective if you can deal with the mess. I certainly would not buy this products as it is messy. Two stars for the effort."
2,BIG TUB OF GOO,"Using these trays is disgusting.....Big chunks of hard clear goo squirt out as you're wearing them, makes you want to get sick. I am supposed to keep this gunk in my mouth for 45 minutes for 7 days? No way. The trays are actually too soft, so you don't get a snug fit, which makes them slip and slide around, annoying. I am going to suffer through the 7 days because I blew $35 on these...Would never buy them again. Next year I'll buy a kit that provides the custom tray, even if I have to pay a little bit more."
2,Why not just use hydrogen peroxide?,"You know... I tried these.I've also tried the white strips.I've also tried hydrogen peroxide (which just so happens to be the main ingredient in most whitening products).Out off all of them, the hydrogen peroxide works the best. 5 minutes a day swishing the generic store-brand 3% stuff around my mouth and within 2 days, my teeth are MUCH whiter than they were. Now if I'd quite smoking, they'd actually stay that way.But seriously. These things are really uncomfortable if you don't have totally straight teeth and they feel like they'd be a tight squeeze even on totally straight teeth. I'd avoid them.And besides... <2 dollars for hydrogen peroxide... over 30 for these!? No-brainer I'm telling you..."
1,Waste of money,"I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so I bough one box at Walmart. It's not worth it, that's my conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like material, and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started to feel a vague pain in my gum. Nevertheless, I continued using the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is barely visible. I hope you will have better luck."
1,Aquafresh White Trays Slip & Slide,This product would work better if the trays stayed in place and the gel could spead over your teeth evenly.I found even after five days the bottom tray hard to keep in place and most of gel going down my throat!The whitening/pain ratio is about the same as Crest strips. I found minimal irritation with average results.Please take back to the DRAWING BOARD for better results!
2,Mediocre,"The nice thing about these trays is they are fairly easy to use. However, I found they do not completely cover my upper or lower teeth (maybe I have big teeth) and they do not seat really well on the teeth. If you get them on properly, they do stay in place pretty well. But, it took me a day or two to get them on properly.The gel is very thick and does not easily spread out to cover the teeth. If you just put the trays on and do not ""squish"" them down to spread the gel, you're going to end up with uneven whitening. Overall, I think I like the way the Crest White Strips work a little better. I thought the trays would be easier to use. But, I will probably go back to the Crest product when I need my next round of whitening."
4,good product,"Works well, I advise keeping the trays in for a longer period of time. My teens used it and they said it wasn't comfortable enough to sleep in."
2,Awful application!,"These are, by far, the worst choice for whitening. The ""trays"" don't mold to your teeth at all, they are extremely flimsy, they feel horrible, and they don't stay put. The whitening gel is disgusting, like thick mucous, and it made me gag when I took the trays out of my mouth because of the way it was hanging on parts of my teeth and the texture is gross. I wish I had ""listened"" to the others who reviewed this product that had similar things to say."
2,"""Burned"" my gums","After user #1 I was REALLY impressed. My teeth were noticeably whiter--almost gleaming. After use number two I noticed a bit more whitening but not as dramatic. On use # 3 I felt some discomfort after putting the trays in. After about 1/2 hour it was really starting to hurt and I thought something must be wrong so I took them out. My gums were bleached white!I was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1/2 an hour. However, there was some lingering damage done that, while not severe, is annoying (there is still a slight bit of bleeding). I have perfectly healthy gums so I was surprised by this...the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums.My advice, if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out."
1,Waste of money,"I have had professional bleaching and used different versions of Crest whitestrips in the past. I thought that I would try something different out of curiosity. I tried twice. It is difficult to position the trays and get the ""goop"" on the front of the teeth. I have a rather small mouth and the trays barely fit over my teeth. They didn't stay in place long enough to get results.I went back to classic Crest whitestrips. I haven't found anything to beat them yet. I plan to call Aquafresh about this product, as I would have gladly spent $30+ on something worthwhile rather than this product that will probably end up in the trash."
1,Not Again,"Yes, I tryed the new Aquafresh Trays, and do not like them. Agree with most others, the trays do not stay put/do not fit teeth well.Big chunks of gel,ends up in your mouth, and its GROSS.I will be going back to the Crest Strips."
3,Allright............,Get your teeth really white but a little uncomfortable since they are a little to small.
1,One-star rating only because there's no zero-star option,"It was an awkward mess - smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered, much less fit securely. It'd probably be easier without the trays. I don't know if they work or not. I gave up. I want my Crest Whitestrips back."
2,Gag- literally,"I decided to try these because the whitestripes fall off my teeth, but I've had to throw away two trays because if the gel comes out it automatically gives me a gag-reflex. You have to not squeeze the gel too much otherwise this happens. I plan to use the rest of the trays until they are gone because they do whiten my teeth, but I will not be buying these again. At least the whitestripes didn't make me gag!"
1,ouch!,"If you have sensitive teeth don't buy this. It hurt so bad. And you have to wear it for 45 minutes for 7 days in a row. I think that is a bit much. But that was my experience, after the 3rd night, I stopped...."
3,works good but could be easier,"my teeth were defiantly whiter after using, but the gel inside the trays is annoying to spread over all of your teeth and most of the time it falls out and it seems like you are wasting your money, next time i am getting white strips rather then trays."
1,Trays are TOO SMALL!,"Well I have my Marine Corps ball coming up in vegas at the end of the week and decided to get my teeth whitened for it. I don't make much money as it is, but this was by far the BIGGEST waste of $30 spent. I should have just gone with the generic brand teeth whitener they had at the on base store, it was half the price at $15, and twice the size of these trays.I have big teeth, and most trays dont completely fit my mouth. But this one? It doesnt even make it a quarter of the way around my teeth, and the gel thing is ridiculous. It has a small lining around the base that you have to put on your teeth yourself when applying the tray, where as the cheaper generic brand as the gel already evenly applied on the whole tray.Too put it simple, I wouldn't recommend this product for ANYONE, but if you really want to try it be my guest. If you are big toothed like myself, expect a very uneven white teeth. Kindve like a farmers tan..."
2,OUCH! MOMMY! HELP! IT BURNS!,"I like my teeth white. But when it requires 45 minutes of searing pain, no-thank-you! I was excited to try this product since it presents itself as better than competitors' white strips. And white it does indeed whiten my teeth, the second I apply the trays my gums start to burn like crazy.When I removed the tray, my gums were swollen and almost completely white for 24 hours. Did the bleach actually get to my gum tissue? Eeeks! I looked like son of Dracula! So much for a pretty smile."
3,ok,"Well, I fairly like this product. It does really make the teeth white. This is what it was made for. It wasn't made to be comfortable or anything... if you want to have white teeth, you have to spend a lot of money at the dentist's or... suffer, cuz that is what these trays are for me. After I use them my teeth become SO sensitive that I can neither chew, nor even breath - it hurts! It all goes away next day after I stop using them, though... but eventually teeth ARE whiter. I give it a 3, cuz the taste and the quality of the gel make me sick... but it works."
2,"Even if it works, is the pain worth it","I have used this for the three days in which the product guaranteed visible results. I do see a difference in how much whiter my teeth are, but it was excruciatingly painful to use this.The first day, it was uncomfortable and I noticed that I was starting to have sores in my mouth. The second day, I was having trouble eating with the sores in my mouth and when I used it, I would rate the pain at a 7 out of 10 with more sores. The third day, I tried it again because the package said that discomfort would be normal... this did NOT seem normal. I just about had it. I put my finger to one of the sores and it popped! Gross! They were blisters of some sort! I wanted to grumble and keep using it because I paid good money for it... but it isn't worth it. I felt that it was much better to watch out for myself and keep myself happy and not in so much pain."
1,warning,"I am only on my second day and am afraid to finish the pack. I had the trays on for 45 minutes as instructed and when I took them off my gums looks damaged. They were white and discolored, but now the color is returning. The gel really hurts my gums. I've used Crest strips and did not have this much tooth and gum pain. It's not worth taking the risk of using this product."
2,Didn't whiten my teeth,"I didn't have any problems using this product and had super high hopes for it because of the reviews. However, these trays didn't whiten my teeth at all, really. I feel like I now have to go and buy a different whitening product and spend more money. It's sad and disappointing- feels like I wasted my money."
2,Trays slip off easily,"I have used most of the box, and the trays slip off my teeth very easily. Once I get them in place I cannot release the pressure on my teeth at all or they slip, some of the gel comes out into my mouth, and they are not as effective. Also, I have receding gums and these trays do not even come close to covering all of the length of my teeth. They are also VERY short—they only cover the front teeth and do not reach very far around to the sides.Despite all that, my teeth do appear to be whiter, but they are unpleasant to use. I just ordered another product, SuperSmile, and I'll see how that goes. it's not a tray, so it should solve several of the problems these trays have."
2,Gloppy,I don't like this product because the gel is si gloppy and falls out of the trays while on my teeth. The gel is not very soft and stays glopped together as one piece. It also gave me a blister on the inside of my mouth. I won't buy it again.: (
4,Easy-to-Use,"This product is so much better than the white strips. I noticed a change in the color of my teeth within three days of use. I do think that using them on a regular basis of more than once in awhile would be great, but I think it is cost-prohibitive."
2,Rather use strips,"I had been using the white strips and decided to try the aquafresh white trays.They DO whiten your teeth, but the bottom tray will NEVER stay on, ever. Top tray is good and reliable and works if you only want half of a white smile. Again, the bottom tray wouldn't stay on and didn't cover my teeth completely.Hope this helps!"
4,Stays in place,"I like these trays. To me, they stay in place much better than the Crest Whitestrips. After 5 days my teeth are definitely whiter. I have the luxury of being able to wear them without talking the whole time. I push the trays to spread the gel onto the teeth and then close tightly for 45 minutes. Slight gum irritation, but no more than with the trays from the dentist. If it matters, dentists tell me I have a small mouth."
4,Whitening my teeth,"This was the first time that I have used a product to whiten my teeth and I was pleasantly surprised at the results of the Aquafresh trays. They showed an actual whitening after the first use and upon completion of all the trays, had whitened my teeth substantially. I have since tried the other whitening strips, but find that your product is much easier to use. The trays stay on your teeth much better than the strips and I like them much better.I would recommend your product over anything else out on the market today."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've tried many different whitening items in the past, and I must say these are the worst! While the gel actually does whiten a bit, it is impossible to apply evenly over the teeth. The thick, ropey gel did not spread like it was supposed to, resulting in uneven coverage and spotting, and the trays did not fit my teeth at all. The old fashioned, dip in boiling water clunky trays are much better than these. Save your money--get Crest Whitestrips instead. They work better, fit and conform to the teeth and are not messy at all."
3,White Trays...Messy and Didn't Notice ALOT of Improvement,"The white trays I got were messy and the gel broke apart alot and caused alot of salivation! Weird!I don't feel the bottom tray did anythingTop tray whitened my teeth some, but the results weren't as dramatic as I had hoped."
3,not for picky people? how bout not for people who don't like pain,"These work, if you can bear to leave them in for more than 5-10 mins. which I couldn't. They recommend 30 mins.THESE HURT - A LOT!Salivating is one thing, but having your eyes tear is another.Picky or not, people shouldn't have to endure this much pain when other products do not cause the same degree.The other reviewers must have had gums of steel or something..."
2,Don't use if your teeth are not perfectly straight,The tray fits fine on my upper teeth but not my lower. The only reason I can figure for this is that two of my lower teeth are not perfectly straight. I had to hold my jaw in a very awkward position to keep the trays in place for the necessary time.
2,Not all its cracked up to be,"It whitened my teeth a little but not to the extent advertised. And it was very messy! You have to leave the trays on for an hour, so if you want to do it make sure you have no one you need to talk to and that the phones are off the hook. Its very inconvient and it sortof irritated my gums. Also its very foamy, so like I said, messy. Goodluck"
1,Terrible Product,The trays are flimsy/poorly cut vinyl plastic. They barely cover the top section of your teeth and will not stay in place. Pretty pissed I spent $25 on this. Do yourself a favor and stick to the Crest strips.
3,Doesn't stay on very well.,"I have just received this product (very fast delivery) and have used them only once. The bottom was almost impossible to put on. The top was a bit easier, but you have to keep your teeth together for 45 minutes or they fall right off! Don't know yet how the whitening actually works, but I will post later."
1,STAY AWAY! Not worth the low price!,"Absolutely awful. The worst whitener I've ever used. I got 20 minutes into the first tray and nearly died from the pain. The goo is too firm and doesn't spread evenly, so it just pools and collects unevenly on the teeth and gums. The flimsy little tray does not conform to your teeth and just causes more problems.In the past I've used Crest as well as Rembrandt, both with decent results. I think from now on I'll stick with Crest. It's very expensive but worth EVERY penny."
3,Decent product,"My dentist recommended I get the Aquafresh compared to other brands. These seemed to work ok, I didn't notice a HUGE difference in my teeth. I probably wil try something else next time. The downside to these is it really makes your teeth tender later on. Don't drink coffee or wine after because it'll stain. BAD! And nothing cold for at least 12 hours I'd say. It's kind of a pain in the butt because you really have to plan your diet around them. You're not supposed to have brushed your teeth immediately before either so brush then get ready for bed and then try them on just before. My best suggestion that way they have all night to work and they're not interrupted by eating, like if you had used them in the morning."
1,Terrible Design!,Cheap and flimsy. I cannot imagine how they could not come up with a better design. I think they put more thought into the packaging than into the product!
1,Difficult to use,This product is really difficult to use! I've used crest whitestrips and these trays are more difficult. The product shifts in the mouth and I've wasted like half of my trays. I'm going to try to get a refund.
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!,"Don't waste your money on this product, it will be the worst 45 minutes of your day. If I even saw these at the dollar store I wouldn't buy them. First of all the trays don't fit right, I can't imagine they will fit anyone right unless you are the one they molded them after. Second, the gel that is in them oozes out and into the back of your throat causing you to swallow it quite often, it's awful and gross. The other thing is, don't even think of talking with these in, because they will come loose and once again the gross gel will ooze out. I'm very disappointed that Aquafresh would put their name on these. I have found the best whitening product is the Rembrandt strips, they stay on your teeth and you can talk with them in, they stay on better than the crest whitestrips, although with both, I think you will get the same result."
1,Poorly Engineered Product,"I have no idea how effective the gel is because I cannot even get the trays to stay in place around my teeth, especially the lower one. Did they actually test these trays on human subjects before going to market? This is the worst teeth whitener product I have ever used, including the generic versions."
1,Aquafresh White Trays,"This is really the first product review I've ever done and the reason I'm doing it is because this product is just awful. Expensive, too. You have to use the toothpaste for up to two weeks to insure against sensitivity. However, the flimsy ""trays"" don't stay on your teeth long enough to warrant the toothpaste. As another reviewer said, you have to keep your teeth clamped together to avoid the trays popping out, and the gel is disgusting. I don't know if they whiten or not, because no way can I keep these in for up to 45 minutes. What a waste of money!"
1,BURNED MY GUMS!,"The first two-three days were fine but day four, the trays burned my gums white and in one spot, brown! It hurts. Plus, the whitening isn't as a great as Crest. The trays also aren't large enough for long teeth and they don't whiten the backs of teeth; only the front. Coloring on the back of teeth and affect the color seen by people when you smile."
2,Won't use it again,"I didn't see much changes after 7 days. It bleached my gum and peeled the gum between my two front teeth, and it also irritated my tongue. However, all this discomfort were bearable. I am not going to buy it again because it didn't bleach my teeth much.I had a lot of foam and saliva during the treatment, so I am not sure if that is the reason the outcome wasn't so good. I used Colgate whitening gel before, and it didn't work either. Therefore, I decide that I am going to let dentist bleach my teeth next time. Hopefully, I would have better luck.Use it before you brush your teeth will reduce the irritation to your gum and teeth. I could go for 45 minutes when I used it before I brushed my teeth."
2,ewww...,"these taste terrible, they don't form to your teeth, the gel is too solid to get into all the right places. i had chunks of slimy gel floating around in my mouth, and the bottom tray never stayed in place. i'll stick to crest whitestrips from now on."
1,do not waste your money,"They are a waste of time and money. They put goo in your mouth and not as much on your teeth. After a week, my teeth are the same color as when I started."
2,"Over priced, and poorly designed trays","For the price of this product, the design of the disposable trays are weak. The trays don't cover the majority of your teeth, and the bottom trays are even smaller in size. If your mouth is the size of a kid, they may work fine. But I would not buy this product again, and I'm applying for a refund."
1,Makes your GUMS white,"This product made part of my gums white and puffy after wearing the trays for 20 minutes. I have healthy gums overall, so I guess they are ""sensitive"". The whiteness has subsided after about 30 minutes but I will not use this product again. Be careful and if your gums sting, remove the trays and rinse. Better yet -- don't get this product."
2,Whittener,The Aquafresh trays only reach the top half of teeth and they are too flimsy. If they would cover the entire tooth I think this would be a good product.
5,Whiter in 2,I have used this product several times. I think it works much better than strips because it foams up and gets in the cracks between teeth. I usually use it every 3-4 months for a touch up on tea/soda stains. I can do 2 or 3 trays and notice a big difference. I save the other trays for later which helps stretch the $.
1,Hurt my teeth and gums,These white strips had hurt my teeth and made my gums white. The trays also weren't very well fitting. I discontinued using them after 3 uses. After those 3 uses I really didn't see a noticeable change in the color of my teeth either. I think in the future I will look into getting them professionally whitened and lay off of the coffee and soda.
1,Sucks...,This is the worst tooth whitening product ever... I have tried all other teeth whiteners and this is by far the worst product. The trays don't stay in your mouth and the gel gets everywhere. Don't spend your money here!
2,Expired?,"I did not see the ""expires 8/11 GOOD UNTIL THE END OF AUGUST"" note until just now and I ordered this item a week or so ago. I plan on returning it as soon as I get it. The note is not anywhere on the selling page. Also, I'm not guaranteed to receive this item until the middle of September."
2,I Was Underwhelmed,"I realize everyone's teeth - and tastes - are different, but I was not blown away by this product. After using it as directed for seven days, I'd say my teeth are a teeny bit brighter but not really noticeably ""whiter."" I think if they made this a 10 day regimen, it would be satisfactory. As it is, I think I'll try another round of whitening with another brand. On the plus side, the trays are pretty easy to use."
5,They work!,"I decided to buy this product before i read the reviews. In my opinion the trays stay on better than the strip kind. There is alot of whitening goo that you press into your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place. The first morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was becuase i pressed too hard. I havent had the problem since.I noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after 7 days. My gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly. The pick color returned within an hour. It really isnt as bad as the other reviewers make it seem.All in all if you are looking for a product that works, this is a good one. I was truly surprised at how well they worked. I will be purchasing these in the future."
5,"they cause sensitivity, but it's worth it!","I have used a million varieties of whitening products, but this one is definitely the best. It whitens so much more quickly and effectively than other means. My only complaint is how sensitive they make your gums; I naturally have sensitive teeth/gums, but the trays temporarily exacerbate the pain a great deal. It's worth it to me, though.My experience with whitening strips is that the resulting whiteness is very temporary, and my dentist tells me this is because they're not permanently whitening my teeth and they look white because the ingredients dehydrate my teeth. She said this is also because I am young and that whitestrips work better on older teeth. These whitening trays have results that last A LOT longer. Would buy again."
1,Horrible,"The trays must have been molded for a 5 year old. They are tiny, good luck fitting them if you have undergone puberty already.They are also completely inflexible, waste of time and money"
2,not that great,trays are small and way to flexible to hold in place. too bad because the whitener seems to work fairly well.
3,Okay,They have removed the stains from my teeth - but my teeth are not as white as I hoped. The gloppy stuff makes me ill after a while.
1,Do not buy,Trays cover a small number of teeth as well as a small per cent of each tooth. This product is one of the more expensive whiteners!
5,"Based on real experience,not just theories!","The list of consequences ""when bad things happen to good projects"" or What-NOT-To-Do is worth the price of the book. I wish I had read this book before starting my 6+ years as a consultant helping organizations to improve. This book presents most of the lessons that I've learned during those years and gives quite a few additional ideas on organization change.Don't let the garish cover art distract you. This is a solidly good book, which I regularly recommend to my clients. Of course, I can't vouch for the Price Waterhouse consulting group's ability to get clients to change successfully or whether they even follow their own advice. I just know that I do apply the best ideas in this book (plus some of my own) in my consulting practice."
3,"Dated, but interesting","This is a somewhat dated tale (originally written in 1969) about Sister Lou, a young girl in the ghetto who forms a Jackson-5 type Soul band as a means to escape. Of course she would probably want to become a rapper today and much of the dialogue and situations are unique to that era. Children may find some sitations and dialougue dificult to relate to today, but their parents will dig."
5,Chaplin and Love,"City Lights finds Chaplin finding love. City lights is insteresting because his other work highlight his comic abilities like Gold Rush or his political views like Modern Time and Great Dictator, City Light finds Chaplin finding love in a really great comedy."
5,Brilliant and Moving!,"While generally known as a film comic, Charles Chaplin often told stories to make the audience think, and occasionally weep. ""City Lights"" certainly fits that description.Though shot in the early days of talking pictures, ""City Lights"" was silent. Chaplin still held onto his immortal character, the Little Tramp. Outwardly appearing as a bum, the Tramp has a heart of gold and is rather self-sacrificing. He encounters a blind flower girl. Determined to pay for a surgery to restore her sight, Chaplin performs several jobs (such as street sweeper and boxer) to secure funds for the operation.The end of the picture, which I will not reveal, is a true gem, among the most memorable and touching climaxes in screen history.I strongly recommend ""City Lights""!"
3,"Bad. Unfunny. Then, Suddenly, It Gets Brilliant.","A strange film. The comedy is labored, the slapstick is tired, the characterizations are slight, every comic moment is drawn out beyond endurance, the pathos is layered on with a shovel. But then comes the most beautiful and heartbreaking five minutes in cinema. Stick with it until the very end. They make it worth the trip."
5,The best movie of all time!,"In my opinion, this is simply the best movie ever made. The underlying theme is about loving someone by making great personal sacrifices (""giving till it hurts."") Yet it's not preachy; it's hilarious. Chaplin perfected the art of moving people to tears and to laughter at virtually the same time. I still get choked up just thinking about this movie.It is one of the first Chaplin movies I ever saw, and it made me a lifelong fan. I have seen all of his films now, but none can quite equal this masterpiece. This is a must-see movie!"
4,City Lights (1931),"Chaplin was a genius. He did it all, writing, directing, producing, acting and even the musical score. This is a wonderful film full of many hilarious moments as well as a touching romance. The scenes with the drunken millionaire are laugh-out-loud funny, particularly the one with the switching chairs in the restaurant. Another hilarious moment is when the little tramp accidentally switches his co-worker's cheese with a bar of soap. Very funny!"
5,Far beyond a simple love story!,"This is one of the most captivating gems in Charlot 's career. The blindness and the poverty; two irreparable scarcities, unconsciously bounded by its unavoidable affective loneliness; the perennial illusion for best times nourishing the sadness of a world in shadows; the elusiveness working out as counterweight of a hopeless state. The geniality of Chaplin resides in joining these unpaired balances randomly established by the destiny 's caprices to build a love story able to move us.The unforgettable Jorge Luis Borges formulated about this work the following statement: ""Who dared to ignore Chaplin is one of the safest Gods of the Mythology of our times, a colleague of the quiet nightmares of Chirico, of Scar face' s fervent machine guns, of the finite universe although unlimited, of the zenithal backs of Greta Garbo, of the obstructed eyes of Gandhi?"""
5,A timeless classic,"This is one of the best movies Chaplin ever made. The content is very simple, but the message it carries is grate. A kind approach to the best human feelings: love, friendship, loyalty, support to the less fortunate; those feelings are hard to find in these days. On the other hand the music is fantastic, the photography also. My recommendation: a must see, and show it to your children too."
5,City Lights,"A silent released when the talkie sensation was in full bloom, Chaplin's ""City Lights"" still swept the box office by storm. Produced, directed, edited, and scored by Chaplin himself, ""City Lights"" melds the sweet, harmlessly buffoonish antics of Chaplin's Little Tramp persona with a larger theme of humanistic social concern. As always, the comic sequences are exquisitely orchestrated, particularly a hilarious boxing match with Hank Mann, as a muscled pugilist. But the real highlight is that eye-opening final scene with Cherrill where Chaplin betrays a touch of something closer to angelic poignancy."
2,City Lights - Overstepping the mawk factor,"The chap who reviewed Dickens's ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" by challenging his readers to read the chapter on the death of Little Nell while keeping a straight face, would have reviewed ""City Lights"". The greatest film comedian of them all has often been criticised for sentimentality(particularly by English critics, who view sentiment as a failing rather than as life-enhancing). In this movie they may have a point. Of his full length features it is the only weak one until the decline into Limelight, King in New York et al.The address below might indicate I'm English. Forget it, I'm Irish."
5,Citizen Kane stinks. City Lights is marvelous,"The cognicenti -- aka, the ""in"" crowd -- has foisted off onto a naive public the notion that Citizen Kane is one of the great movies of all time. El-wrong-o! Citizen Kane stinks! It is dark, moody, Orson Wellsian... and overacted (and me, a Wells fan). City Lights is the true classic, and Chaplin is an artistic genius. Remember how fat Wells became in later life? Well his liver knew that Kane was a bomb... and it stewed about it for years and that is why Wells became a stupendous fatso. It did not help that he was married to one of the Gabor sisters. [...]"
1,Cute But Unfunny,"City Lights tries to turn pathos into comedy, or is it the other way round? Well, the pathos does seem to work because of the trick of letting the heroine be blind (at first), and therefore she doesn't know that her love is a tramp. But there is very little to laugh about in the film.Admitted: Chaplin is a great film maker, kind of very visual. But he simply is not funny."
5,THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I still remember seeing this movie at a Charlie Chaplin film festival in New York City in the 1970's. I went to laugh and to be see a great comedy ( which I did ) ,but, I left the Movie Theatre in TEARS !!!!!!!!!!. I actually sat there for a few minutes after the film ended in disbelief. Up to that point my favorite Chaplin films were from the Mutual Series ( I still love them),but, nothing - nothing could compare with ""City Lights"". a MUST SEE film for EVERYONE !!!!!!!!!!!...My favorite film ---""City Lights """
2,Depends on your Desires,"If you hate studying the endgame like I do, this book is of very little value. Your much better off buying Silman's Complete Endgame Course from Beginner to Master. This book is just to ponderous for anybody unless he wants to spends hours and hours pouring over it and loves the minutiae of the endgame. From this perspective, I give it only 2 stars. I am USCF rated 1757."
3,Good....But not the best I've had!,"The arrangements were well done, however I found the chants to be rather amateurish and stilted...I really had to struggle to feel the commitment of the artist."
5,Easy to learn and powerful.,"This is just what I was looking for. It didn't matter to me that the singing was not perfect. I was looking for simple, meaningful, easy to learn pagan songs and chants. I use them all the time in rituals. They're awesome."
1,Did not receive what I ordered!,I did not receive what I ordered. The picture clearly shows a steering wheel cover with the dodge logo in white and red with the lettering dodge. I received a different steering wheel cover that says dodge RAM. I received a different item than what I ordered and expected and I am very displeased.
4,Good protector.,"I owned the same one before so I knew what I was getting. It is strong and comfortable but my previous one snagged on my belt buckle which spoiled it but still lasted long as I put it on an older truck instead. Protects well, doesn't rub or leave any residue."
3,The American Indian in general,"Reading this book is more than an introduction to what Native Americans are and have been about. It's a good read for the scholar of American Indian studies but be prepared to plow through the text.Deloria gives you fews from many different directions. You might be a bit disappointed if you want to read about specific Native American Nations and get a feel for certain cultures.Don't expect to get a good geographic cultural view of nations, traditions, and more. For this you'll need to address journals and search libraries. Expect others to tell you the book doesn't flow well enough and there are strong hints of bias, to say the least.Consider reading this if you have a lot of time and desire to hear the opinions of a man known as a scholar of several disciplines. Search around and hear what others have to say before you tackle this book."
2,Very Advanced book not for starters,"This book was used by me as an introduction to fluid mechanics. It is not a good book to be used by someone starting fluid mechanics, but it is a very advanced book with often very complicated mathematics, probably more for advanced courses rather than introductory courses in civil engineering. Navier Stokes equations are used often in the book and it does present it in a very good way together with dimensional analysis. I think this is the only plus for this book."
5,best celtic band ever,"the best cd ever from a celtic band, great music, verry well done, it a must buy."
1,treeeeenndy,"punk is dead, enough said. all trhey do is play 3 power chords in a repeeated pattern and whine about politics this is what punk is then? huh something soooo trendy its dead beyond reason. to be punk iso to not even be notified, dress as a punk its just to change. its a rebellious/defensive attitude. not a mohawk or spike or whatever dude this band/music genre is really lame.let it go"
4,This was the movie that I discovered Randal Malone,"Yep, this is the first time I watched one of these Sterling Pictures (found it in one of those 50 Movie packs that were so popular over the last decade) and it was my first exposure to actor Randal Malone, stylish, smooth and menacing; he is channeling Vincent Price in this one and brings a little class to the proceedings; ancient vampire creature seeking resurrection plot, yes, stupid people dying for being stupid, yes, and shot on digital, yes. I had a good time with this and if low-bugeters are your thing, give it a shot."
4,Not quite what I was looking for,"This is a good exhibition catalogue for the Lille showing of Ruben's work, but is not a comprehensive catalogue raisonne of his work. Since a number of his masterpieces could not be shipped to Lille, they are not included in the book - with the exception of some small black and white reproductions. It would have been great to have large colour plates of works such as the Samson and Delilah in the National Gallery in London.In spite of this limitation the book is definitely still worth having: the reproductions are excellent and the selection of works is representative."
2,Okay... but not great.,"My biggest problem with this book is that it features quite a few ""detail"" images. These images are obviously just blown up sections of the photography that they have... meaning that they are fuzzy. Having fuzzy details defeats the purpose of having a detail. I'd probably get another book on Rubens."
4,Rocks,"This album is bangin'! Smooth beats, tight lyrics, and a totally individual sound for the time!"
4,Opinion,"Liked the book, I thought it had some information that will be helpful in business as well as life in general."
5,Highly Reccomend for Pastors by Pastors,I was recently encouraged to read this book for an upcoming church leadership conference in May. It is one of the best books I've ever read on the topic of integrity and character.If you are a pastor looking for a good solid read I'd high reccomend this one!
5,A Must Read for CEO's,"I have been a coach and counselor to CEO's for much of my adult life. When you think of integrity, you first think of being honest or truthful. Henry Cloud takes integrity to a whole new level. He makes you think about the term in new ways! You think about not only being productive, but also about transforming your productivity to a whole new level of leadership. Integrity will challenge any CEO reader to a new level of thoughtfulness, depth, and results. I highly recommend the book for any CEO or aspiring leader.Doug WilsonCEONext Solutions, Inc."
5,Integrity: The Courage to Meet the Demands of Reality Integrity: The Courage to Meet the Demands of Reality,Cloud's homey style of writing for this book enriches the study pleasure. The learning points that are illuminating for anyone interested in understanding the application of the principles of living a complete life.
5,The best,"In the words of a CEO of a top firm, ""This is the best book I have read in some time"". A must read."
2,Generalized overview with little new insight,"I agree completely with the Becksted review (I also noted that it was helpful, but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).This refers to the CD version. I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?)It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to ""integrity"" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn't help me much."
1,Please Do Not Read,"This book is complete fluff, has no central argument and consists primarily of overly generalized stories that are obviously made-up.For those looking to read a serious business or self-improvement book you don't waste your time and your $10. The author should be ashamed of publishing such complete drivel."
5,Exceptional Service,Had this in less than 48 hours. Kudos. The book is a must read for people who seem to make excuses about living in integrity .
4,Help the child to study,My daughter love it. It help her to study what she need . And the price is ok not matter.
3,A quick read for absolute beginners,"If you know nothing about vegans and are just interested in an introduction to the health aspects alone, than this is the book for you. I feel it was written toward a younger audience (say....early teens) but, to its credit, attempted jokes made it a bit more enjoyable. It is only concerned with the health of a vegan diet (notice the title) so for anyone interested in veganism beyond reducing heart disease and cancer, there are many other books out there that have a more wholistic and less self-centered approach. Also, the topics it does cover are somewhat skimmed over, which may or may not be a good thing for you. To sum it up, wanna know about vegan health in an hour? Read this book. Want to know more than just health benefits, or a more in-depth approach and explanation? Pick something else."
3,You REALLY need an open mind to watch this one...,"So I'm the first to review ""Sickness House""... Obviously an independent film characterized by its low budget, which is evident in the settings, ""special effects,"" and make-up effects, not to mention acting so bad that it hurt my feelings... Yet, I still kind of liked it. I must admit, I turned it off after the first five minutes, when I saw the ""doctor"" visit his patient in a clinic or private room that resembled somebody's kitchen. But... I had to see it with an open mind. Basically, two women visit deepest, darkest Africa on vacation and come back with more than for what they bargained. The illness finds its way to a New Year's Eve party and basically ruins everybody's night. Okay, so perhaps I'm holding on to this one because of its unintentional humor. Why are YOU going to hold on to it?"
3,It's fantastic but just not for me,"This nursing nest is fantastic for larger breasted women or bigger babies. My son was a 6lbs seven ounces just to compare. Personally, it was kind of a struggle getting my son to be able to reach me. I had to really lean into it in order for him to be able to nurse. I felt like I was stretching my breast out. I wish I could have used it but unfortunately by the time he would have been the perfect size I had already stopped breast feeding. But for ""larger"" women this is perfect to use while on the computer or to give your back a break."
2,Baby doesn't like it,"Well, my baby doesn't sleep in this, and neither did my sister's. I actually bought it for her because she wanted to co-sleep but was nervous about it. I thought this would calm her fears. But she found it inconvenient and only used it a few times.She passed it on to me when I got pregnant, and I tried to use it, but my baby didn't like it. She preferred to be on the bed, right next to me, so that's how we did it, and still do. My baby is 18 months old now, and we love co-sleeping, and don't have any concerns about the safety of doing it the old fashioned way.If this thing will encourage anyone to co-sleep, then by all means, go for it! Just because it didn't work for us doesn't mean it isn't a great idea. Co-sleeping is one of the best decisions I've made for my kids, and if this will help you take that step, then go for it."
5,Wonderful!,This book does a wonderful job of educating the youngest & oldest about Celiac's. It takes you through pre-diagnosis to living & managing the diet. My 2 year old loves to read about a little girl like herself who meets a little boy who also has Celiac's. She feels special everytime that we read it.
5,My daughter loves it,My daughter loves this book! She's 5 years old. She was very excited about bringing this book to share with her pre-k class. It has really helped the kids in her class to understand and be supportive of her severe gluten-allergy.
4,my daughter (7 yr) loves it,This book is great my 7yr old takes it with her alot...I sent to school and her teacher is doing a lesson on it...it helped her see she's not different and someone even cared enough to write a book!
4,Eating Gluten Free with Emily,"This book is excellent for anyone with a child newly diagnosed with Celiac Disease or for explaining it to your child's friends or classmates. I would like to see it reprinted so that it is easier to find in Canada, and perhaps relaunch with an Ethan instead of Emily. However my kids got a lot out of it and have a better understanding of the disease and the new way of life in our home. Thumbs up!"
3,Prolly Not Worth Buying,"HelloOK, i own a ton of live phish releases, and in all honesty, Live 05 is the weakest i've heard. Thats not to say its terrible, cuz there are some highlights. The first set comes out firing with pyite and NICU, my soul and poor heart. First Tube is real trippy with trey looping a bunch of stuff. ill placed Llama. so first set is cool, good antelope closer. The second set is kinda weak in my opinion. heavy things is not done well to start off the set. Piper is decent. Tweezer is decent at best. and walk away is really not that good. Twist is decent, silent in the morning is what you expect. I've heard Possum too many times. Suzy is only ok, and tweprise is always fun to hear. so all in all its a decent show. but the thing is this, when compared to every other live phish release, this is really low grade stuff. its not phish at their best. if you buy 04 or 11, there is some epic stuff. 05 is ok, but not that great."
4,odd choice ? You decide !,"Excellent recording of this show. Alpine Valley has always been the most impressive venue to see live acts in the summertime, especially PHISH. As all previous years, Phish sold out this Saturday show and really drew an even larger crowd of Pholks to the lots. As far as Summer 2000 Phish, goes, this show was pretty ho-hum. The only Llama of the tour was the only real surprise from the first set. The Heavy Things set two opener can be heard to disappoint the crowd, but the Piper follow up is the absolute cherry of the whole show. It is one of those moments that keeps people coming back for 50 shows or more. The only Horse and Silent in the Morning of the tour are near the end of the set. The only Suzy Greenberg is part of the encore (ho-hum short version) and the obligatory Tweezer Reprise closes the show with a bash. All in all, great release from Phish, but why release the 2000 stuff that everybody already has on CD???????????? !!!"
5,A good book for a chess beginner.,"I bought this book for my 9yo daughter on recommendation from her chess teacher. She has only recently gotten into chess and enjoys the mental challenge. The book has captivated her and she has been attempting to teach me what she has learned from this book. I don't know how good it would be for an experienced chess player (based on the chess teachers recommendation,I suspect it is good here too) but it seems to be very well suited to my daughter."
5,an all time best,The alap in this recording is the ultimate musical experience. This raga lends itself extremely well to the bansuri and Chaurasia's rendering is pure magic.
5,GREAT SCOPE!,"I own four of these scopes and have been using them problem-free for about 10 years. IMO, they are perfect matches for my Marlin 336 and 444P and recently, my M&P 15 and Ruger 10/22. Fit and finish, clarity, function and durability of these scopes are top notch. They have true 1X power enabling rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. None of these scopes have ever lost zero on their weapons. Priced right and made in Japan, these scopes blow away other foreign competition!"
1,People that can't sell.,"It makes you wonder about people that put products up for sale but fail to provide the ""specific"" information necessary to purchase a product as simple as a trash can. Hello? Anybody home? Please specify the HEIGHT, DEPTH AND WIDTH.It looks like this: 15''H x 13.5''W x 10.25''DGood God!"
1,"Title is misleading; 13"" x 10"" is not square. where did they go to school?","Title is misleading; 13"" x 10"" is not square. where did they go to school?"
5,A nice collection . . .,"butEnoch Light Plays the Greatest Hits of Glenn Millerincludes two additional tracks: ""Stardust"" and ""I'll Never Smile Again"" and, depending on your preferences, might be an even better collection."
1,very bad experience,"Never received first order(placed on 21 Apr 08). Seller sent second CD on 14 May, finally received second CD on 23 May. It appeared to be what I ordered but when I played it the music was NOT Glenn Miller and the orchestra was NOT Enoch Light even though the jewlw box and CD itself were labled as though they were the ""Golden Era of Glenn Miller"". The seller(Woody's Books) better double-check their suppliers. I do not know what is on that CD but I do know it is NOT what I ordered. Plus, I really dislike having to talk to people in INDIA to resolve a problem through Amazon's customers"" service. I would still like to have this CD if I kneww how to get the correct thing! Any ideas???"
5,If only we could remain Forever Young!,"This is a very good movie, though a little sad. Makes you realize how important it is to enjoy life and love while you can, because you never know when everything will change, maybe forever. Mel Gibson looses a large part of his life, when he is involved in an experiment that goes awry. He does learn a lot from the ordeal and gets to enjoy the end of his life."
4,A Time Travel Movie With Feeling,"This is another of these frozen-in-time movies. I know at least two of them that were made in 1991-1992 and they were both fun to watch: this movie and ""Late For Dinner.""The good things that this particular film has going for it are: 1 - Mel Gibson plays a very likable lead character in ""Captain Daniel McCormick;"" 2 - there is a nice 1940s atmosphere in the beginning with a beautiful Isabell Glasser, who exhibits one of the sweetest faces and smiles I've seen on film; 3 - there is a good mix of humor, drama and intrigue, as well as fantasy in the story; 4 - there is a nice, almost tear-inducing ending.The film got criticized for being too unrealistic but, hey, it's supposed to be a fantasy story where everything is not explained. Overall, a nice, touching movie."
3,Excellent cast.,"Forever Young is a good and romantic drama. The story is a bit soapy but I believe this film was written by J.J. Abrams who went on to bigger and better things. The cast is extraordinary here with stars like Mel Gibson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and a young Elijah Wood. I like this film, brings back a lot of great memories, check it out sometime!"
5,love this movie!,"I love this movie! The classic romance, the modern-day dilemmas, great quotes like ""It's the dead guy!!"" And, of course, all the flying scenes! Mel Gibson, Jamie Lee Curtis and Elijah Wood are favorites of our family and did not disappoint in this wonderful film."
1,No OAR = No Sale...,"Staring Mel Gibson, this is an entertaining family movie with just a smidgen of science fiction. But where's the theatrical widescreen edition? Sorry, but I only purchase DVDs displaying the film's ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO."
1,Predictable and boring,"If you can't figure out the ending to this movie in 20 minutes, you need to watch more movies. The plot just unrolls itself in a predictable manner, the make-up looks like someone threw pancake batter on the actors' faces and and heated it with a hair dryer, the acting was canned.Watch this movie only if you want to be able to say something like, ""I've seen all of Mel Gibson's movies... including Forever Young"""
4,Sweet Romance...if that's your thing,"Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis are fully committed to this sweet little fantasy-romance that is a great date movie or when you just need to see a ""chick-flick.""Unfortunately, the DVD I purchased from amazon was defective and had to be returned, but --unless you're a die hard fan of the stars or the genre-- there's no real reason to own this one. It's strictly a rental or you can wait around for it to be on TV--I can't imagine they edit much out for broadcast.No noteworthy bonus features."
5,"Corny, Silly, and all that.... but still a great love story","OK, this film is silly. Guy in love, scared to pop the question; girl hit by a truck (literally), goes into a coma; guy decides life not worth living so volunteers for the first-ever (top secret!!!) cryogenics experiment. Wakes up 53 years later, discovers the world has forgotten about him, but he has not forgotten anything; especially not his one true love and his best (only) friend.So, dimiss the movie on the altar of ""ridiculous, not realistic at all...""OREnjoy a beautifully made love story of human beings (and planes...) that works at multiple levels. The scene where Daniel (Gibson) teaches Nat (Wood) to fly is simply one of the best ""romance"" scenes ever filmed by Hollywood (in the truest sense of the word ""romance"", see [...]).The only truly wrong note in the movie is the ending, so quit about 45 seconds before the end, if you can. Till then, sit back and enjoy."
5,Great Movie.Gibson,One of my favorite movies of all time. Done well by Gibson and Curtis. I loved the little boys that played the young boys parts. Great delivery time.
1,Extremely poor copy,"It appears as though this DVD was made from a poor VHS copy. Barely legible stamp on the back of the case said ""disk made in Mexico"". It also appears that the ""CC"" was on when the disk was made and there is no way from the DVD Menu to turn it off."
2,Terrible sound,Meth and Red are the sh&% but Method Man's mic at this live show is too low and you can't hear anything when he's spittin. It's so frustrating I couldn't watch after 5 minutes. Don't waste your money.
2,Missed Opportunity,"I saw The Who three times during last years tour. This DVD comes close to capturing their show but has some serious limitations. Picture quality is great, but why must we suffer a jump cut every one to two seconds? Does the director feel this is necessary to maintain our interest? Just when you start to enjoy a scene, you're off to see a super close up of someone or whole hall shot. They should of left the spinning camera zooms back in the sixties. Very distracting. The sound is fair with a somewhat muddy drum and bass mix. And the guests? I can see Eddie Vedder, but Bryan Adams???? Why butcher Who classics just to drag in more guests? Ugh! The band is 5 stars. The DVD missed, it's a 2. A band of this quality deserves more. Hang the director, editor and sound engineer."
2,"Good video, BAD audio!","I was soooo disapointed in the audio on this DVD that it cancelled any good feeling I had about the video. Entwistle's bass sounds tinny at best, and I don't think I ever heard the bass drum. The vocals were thin as well. Such a waste.... could have been top notch if the audio was up to par."
2,Love the Who-Hated this DVD!,"I have a high end surround system that delivers superb sound. This is the most disappointing DVD I have ever purchased when it comes to AUDIO quality, or lack of. It sounds as if you are playing an AM radio stuck between two pillows. Very bad audio!"
5,the who -live at royal albert hall,"EXCELLENT LIVE DVD.AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THE WHO STILL CAPUTURE THE SPONTANIOUS ELECTRIFING LAGER THAN LIFE ROCK AND ROLL PERFORMANCE.THERE LIKE A HYPER COASTER AND ROCK THE HOUSE LIKE NO OTHER.THIS IS NOT SOME WATERED DOWN SOUNDS LIKE THAT SONG STUFF ,IT IS AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN,AND SHOULD BE.GREAT FIDELITY AND EXCELLENT CAMERA ANGLES.THEY PLAY THERE CLASSIC TUNES AND LATER HITS WITHOUT ADDING SOME TYPE OF MUZAK INFLUENCED YUPPIE LARVA THING. IT IS THE WHO FOR ALL ITS WORTH AND WILL BE ENJOYED OVER AND OVER."
3,"Good, not Great","Let's face it, the Who were great in their heyday. But as singers age, so do their voices. Most cannot hit the notes that made them famous and these guys are no exception. The concert material is great, if you don't expect them to sound like they used to."
1,What ever happened to I hope I die before I get old?,"After seeing the Who perform fabulously in the Concert for New York, I was eager to see this DVD. RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH. I could not sit through this DVD. They sound very bad throughout the entirety. So bad in fact that Pete swears at the audiance for comments made. ROCK IS DEAD. Please choose another Who DVD."
3,A Technological Disappointment,"As a Who fan, I purchased this DVD with excitement and anticipation. As a show, the concert is worth watching. However, considering the technology available, this DVD sounds like Pete himself mixed it (with his seriously deteriorated hearing)(and I understand that Albert Hall is NOT one of the best accoustical venues). The two 5.1 mixes are horribly tinny with Entwistle's bass nearly non-existent. And, this is a long concert, so the attack on your ears makes it nearly impossible to view this in one sitting. Worth purchasing as it's Entwisle's last recorded show before his death, but a disappointment overall."
2,"Great music, bad editing","I love The Who's music so I bought the DVD, the music is what I expected. My disappointment is the video editing. They dont let you get more than a 3 second view of Roger, Pete and John before jumping to a view from the rafters, to the crowd, to a closeup, etc. I could have used sea sick pills. Why do all that editing? Just show the guys playing!!"
4,The little known best one without Moon,"There are a number of WHO DVD's around but of the 'new' WHO lineup, this is the best. Compare the other new ones that don't include John Entwhistle, they are no way as good. Check out just how much he drove the band with Keith Moon.(which is why I give any WHO DVD without Keith a '4' rating) Its worth buying this just to see Entwhistle on the bass. Such an underrated musician. The other guests are really good as well. Usual power and colour from townsend as well. If, like me you live in Australia then this new version will not play in our zone and you will need to have a DVD player tht can be tuned or changed to all sector zones, otherwise its a bloody hassle."
3,The Retirement Tour,"If you are a new fan, this will seem great. Perhaps for some of the old fans....there is enough here to still suffice.The Who have changed and this is a video that proves it. Pete can play faster now thanever before...w/riffs that he could play in his sleep. Roger cannot hit high notes like he used to. This is a greatest hits show...if this was another band I'd be impressed....but alas...its not. Townshend needs to continue w/ his musical journey and figure out what it is that he wants to say. The playing on this show...high speed boring-AND thats NOT ok for the worlds greatest band.Listen to the version of Who are you from the LifeHouse box set to know how much is missing from this show."
2,The setlist in not all performed by the WHO,"Half of the songs are performed by high paid stand in's like Eddie Vedder and other 90's radio rock hero's that have no business taking mic time away from Roger Daltry who does perform a number of songs. Aparently there was little money or donations collected from this as the stand in's as drone as they were, were very costly and wanted their money. Shame."
5,The Disc captures the Who at their best in years...,This disc is awesome. Zak Starkey has revitalized the band and Entwistle once again proves he was/is the best bassist in rock. Pete plays with renewed fire. I love this disc.
5,Amazing!!,"They say that Ringo's good friend, Keith Moon, taught young Zak Starkey how to play drums. Well that's for damn sure. No Ringo here with The Who. If there was anyone that could have and should have stepped in for Keith Moon, it's Zak Starkey. Starkey lifts this performance to the highest plateau's. Oaisis is lucky to have Starkey behind them! Top notch performances on every song and great guests, Noel Gallagher (Oasis) and Eddie Vedder to name a few. Buy this and crank the surround sound, because there is only one way to listen to the Who and one way to watch this concert, LOUD!!!!"
5,The Who Live at Albert Hall is Awesome!,"I've watched this video 4 times since Christmas -- good thing it's a DVD -- I'd wear out a tape! I saw The Who live in 1971 after ""Who's Next?"" came out, and 3 more times over the years. The greatest shows I've ever seen. We were fortunate enough to see this tour in Denver in August of 2000, and wondered when a video would be coming. We took our teenage daughters to this concert -- their first classic rock concert. They were speechless -- totally amazed at how great a ""bunch of old guys"" could perform. Owning the DVD will let me relive that concert for a long time. A week ago, we saw Tommy on stage in Denver, and the paper said that The Who would be touring the US next summer again. I hope this is true. I'll attend ever concert I can, nobody can compare! Do not miss seeing them live in you have the chance, but in the meantime, buy the DVD! Definitely the greatest band to ever hit the stage!"
1,I Would Have Been Better Off Using The Money For This CD To Wipe My Behind,"After reading all of the other reviews, I was convinced that this was one of the greatest CDs for ritual that could be found. One person even referred to this CD as a ""ritual in a box."" Well, I guess that person has never been to a ritual that was anywhere near being worthy of anyones time. The songs lacked sound structure, there was no lyrics sheet (because, of course, there was no structure), and the music was absolutely horrible. The voices of the singers was so beyond being abrasive, that I couldn't bear to listen for very long."
4,Perfect for price,This racket is a steal for $15.Pros: I was very pleased with the distribution of the weight in the paddle. My serves were exceptionally accurate and I could get some strong spin on the ball. Well constructedCons: It was quite heavy and the wood was pretty cheap feeling. The heaviness of the racket hurt my accuracy but I will adapt to it the more I play with it.Overall: I could not expect more for the price I paid for this and I am very pleased with it. I will want to upgrade in the next few months though.
3,"All control, no spin","This racket's rubber is very poor for putting spin on the ball. I am aware it is mostly a ""control"" paddle but I did not think it would be this unbalanced. After playing with it for several months I decided to purchased the Kyoshi version of this product line. For the extra 8 or so bucks it costs, the Kyoshi is a much more balanced paddle. Unless your preference is for paddle with no spin (to counter an opponent with lots of spin) the kyoshi is a superior value."
2,"Too slow, even for a Cadfael mystery","Not enough energy, not enough mystery-solving, not enough romance, not enough humor, not enough wisdom, not enough action (although that's usually not needed in Cadfael stories)- not enough anything. Very flat. Had I seen this prior to purchasing it, I would not have purchased it."
4,"at first unorganized, but ties itself together","""First French Kiss and other Traumas..."" definitely had its moments. Throughout these excerpts from the writers youth, he tells entertaining stories, but in a random and unorganized style. While reading the book, i was entertained, but at the same time i was puzzled as to why he was choosing which story to tell, and the order he chose to arrange the stories in. However, within the last two stories, the reader engaged me and made me feel like i understood everything he was going through. With the death of his father, the most captivating scenario he described in his memoir to his father was his father vs. him AND his brother in an arm wrestling contest. That scenario captured the relationship he had with his father: the stereotypical (charming none the less) father-son relationship where the father is a big strong man and the son looks up to him. this book will have you make you want to cherish your youth years. it is truley a gem."
4,Falling Down dvd,I love this story about a guy pushed a little too far. He does what we all daydream about doing. It's a very interesting story. With humor and action all mixed together. Everyone should watch this.
4,Difficulty of remaining standing!!,"Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall portray the struggles of two people on the edge struggling to remain standing even though the world around them symbolically is crumbling down.Yes, there are scenes of violence in the movie but these are reflection of life in a tough neighborhood."
4,Quality of the movie aside.,"I ordered from amazon, it said new in package, but I think it might have been resealed after use. Either way it's a working disc so i have no complaints."
2,Heavy and cumbersome,The airplane looks cute but is extremely heavy and my 2yr old has trouble operating it. The parental remote control does not work at all therefore we can not use this product until he gets old enough to operate it on his own.
2,Just only for review math not for practice,"This book contains a good review in Math. However, in verbal section it contains only a few reviews and tips compare to those from Kaplan or Princeton review. Moreover, the questions seems to be easier than what you will face on real GMAT questions."
1,Use this book if you want to fail the GMAT,"This is by far the worst book written for the GMAT. The questions are so easy it's almost a joke. I guess if your goal on the GMAT is a 450, then sure use this book."
2,endless riffs of nowhere,"Static-X has a new cd. As soon as I heard that I was excited because their first cd is one of the best new metal cds out. Then I bought Machine and saw, Static-X has a new guitarist. Tripp from Dope. And that made all the difference. Unlike their first cd which is not only filled with wayne static's repetitve vocals and guitar lines but also their original guitarists very intricate and stylized guitar skills, Machine can only offer too much of the same thing. Guitar, repeat. Vocals, repeat. End. Not much there. While both Wayne and Tripp are good guitarists, neither does enough to stand out from the other on Machine. What this leaves people with is a cd that is easily forgetable and hard to stay awake through."
4,goood metal album,better and more structured than wdt. great pounding machanical rhythms. Awsome vocals by wane. the only drawback is the lack of songs and having less variety in songs. the best songs are **it in a bag and black and white.
1,A Huge Let Down,"I really liked Wisconsin Death Trip, but this disc is just bad. The creativity of Wisconsin Death Trip was the only thing that kept my mind off of the fact that there is very little talent involved in the music. When I first heard ""Sweat of the Bud"" I almost fell of my chair. I had never heard anything like it before. Dissapointingly, Waynes vocals on Machine are dull and boring. Tripp and Wayne's guitar riffs are just plain horrible. They are distorted beyond the max, and its impossible to decipher one from another because they sound so much alike. Every song sounds almost exactly alike, unlike most of Wisconsin Death Trip. This is a classic example of a band showing creative and/or original promise on their debut, but killing all that potential with their sophmore release. Static-X better go back and search for their creative egde, or else this listenner, and many others, will no longer care."
5,I love this CD,"...I love it. The best songs are Cold, Black and White, Otsego Undead and Structural Defect. It is a little different than Wisconsin Death Trip but it's still good. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes this kind of music. It's worth your money."
2,Disappointing,"I'll tell you, I expected a lot better from Static-X. After their debut, which I thought was pretty good at the time it was released, I expected ""Machine"" to be hard, heavy, and fantastic considering that Static-X were scheduled to tour with Pantera and Slayer (two bands which you have to be all of the above to tour with). Well, when I first listened to ""Machine"", I was disappointed right off the bat. ""Get to the Gone"", ""Ostego Undead"", ""This is Not"", and ""Burn to Burn"" sound like Wayne Static is trying to make Static-X sound like Ministry for the new generation, with repetitive drum loops and uninspired lyrics that really bring ""Machine"" down a whole lot. ""Black & White"" and ""S*** in a Bag"" are pretty good, but all in all ""Machine"" is a disappointing album that I was really looking forward to. I only hope the boys in Static-X can rebound from this, because they are a great band."
3,Static-X: Machine,"When i bought this cd I didn't know much about it, but I had their first album which I thought was great. I have to say I was a little bit disappointed.Most of the songs just ... For example the second song (which starts quite funnily from the intro) is nothing but just screaming and yelling while the guitar plays the same riff over and over and over again.The only song in this album that is worth the price is Cold, because it's very melodic for a dark-themed song. It is actually one of the best songs I've ever heard. I do like Burn to Burn and Machine too.3 songs aren't enough and I wouldn't even give half of what I'm giving this cd now without them, but I guess these 3 songs are all worth an extra star."
4,"Good, but not like their first","Yes, this is a pretty good album. When I got this I had not yet heard their first. This one is different as it's not as techno as the first album. For instance, in the first one there is all these weird playbacks, like in ""I'm With Stupid.""This is a great CD though, and the best song is song 1-2. I was pretty conrnfused when I put this into my CD player and heard country music. Anyway, get it, it's surprising and fun to listen too."
2,What happened?,"Is this the same band that wrote ""Bled for Days"" and ""Love Dump?"" This CD is just a bunch of heavy industrial tracks that go nowhere and do nothing. I used to consider Static X better than Spineshank, but there is better music on The Height of Callousness than on Machine. If you're just getting into Static X, get Wisconson Death Trip. Otherwise, try anything by Fear Factory."
2,They could have done a lot better,"Static-X is an awesome band but I dont know what happened this time.The CD isn't all that bad but they really lost their touch in this one.They are screaming without anything in mind.It seems like they made this one in 2 days.Some songs that really disapointed me were ""Get to the Gone"",""This is Not"",""Cold"",and ""Burn to Burn"".I used to be a big Static-X fan but since I bought this one I dont know if they are gonna keep going downhill from here or if they can get back their style.I think much less of them now.I don't recommend this to any of those Static fans out there just wait tell their next one comes out and we'll see how that turns out."
1,Lets pretend this never happened....,"What the hell happened between Death Trip and Machine?! I know that they have a new guitarist and all, but why was this album such a let down? Death Trip was one of my favorite albums of all time,and I was one on the biggest Static X fan around but even I though Machine was horrible. It seems lifeless and dull compared to the older album. First off the songs sound like they were rushed and that there were not alot of thought put into them. Wayne's vocals were at one level the whole album (there were no variation from low to high like there was in Death Trip). I hope that Static X is not a one album trick pony, and I hope they put more thought and effort into album #3."
3,it could get better,"machine follows the heritage of the ""Wisconsin Death Trip"". Strong riffs, wild energy but very repetitous, and if u are not a complete fan of Static-X, you might not want to bother checking this out. Otherwise it shows some maturity from X and also a greater variety of sounds which was surelly not used on their firstborn album. All in all an outstanding hard metal perfromance but not something that will bring static X to the daylight of comercial success!"
2,Industiral For Dance Clubs,Static-X's first album was alot better than this. ''This is not'' sounds harsh and sort of industrial with the mechanical beats. ''Black and white'' has the spacey effects and sounds alienish which your average alien or robot might buy thisalbum. The song ''cold'' has cool guitaring and I liked it butthis is not very good which the songs have too many electronic gadgets and Wayne sounds like a robot talking and what happened to his howlings. It's best that people stick with Static-X's first album because it is better and not industrial.
2,Never as good as the first time,No where near as good as Wisconsin Deathtrip. I was dissapointed big time.
4,"A worthy follow up to ""Wisconsin Death Trip""","""Machine"" contains the same hard and grinding heavy metal sound that fans have come to know from Static-X's previous release, ""Wisconsin Death Trip"". In fact, this release seems to feature an even more polished production than ""Wisconsin Death Trip"". The CD has a solid opening and an end, and every track is original enough to keep one's interest throughout. My only gripe about Static-X is that a lot of their songs are repetitive, and the lyrics are not really that deep. But hey, sometimes it's good to be able to just let go and listen to something just plain thrashing and heavy. In that regard, ""Machine"" certainly delivers. It's worthy of a place in every heavy metal fan's music collection."
2,"Static, what happened? WDT was so good! This is just ok.","I was a big fan of Wisconsin Death Trip. I think that's one of the best CD's ever put out. The music, art, and overall feel had an high tech, semi industrial, almost anime style to it. It was smart and edgy, but most of all it was unusual. Static-X had a sound like no other, and it was good. So then what happens? They lose Koichi, and hire Tripp Rex Eisen. Now I don't know where they found this guy, but you can tell he's such a nice guy when he thanks Koichi for leaving the band. Yeah, real sweetheart. I hope someone reminds him not to let the door hit him on the way out, because Koichi's absence seems to be the reason the whole uniqueness of the band is gone.This CD is ok. Not great. Just average. I liked a few songs quite a lot, such as This is Not and Get to the Gone. These sounded like they fit in with WDT. The rest is just kind of like the average metal band. Don't we have enough one hit wonders out there?"
2,You can only listen to the same album so many times....,"Don't get me wrong, I am not anti-Static-X, I enjoyed their debut album very much and was anxious to hear this. I figured after an album like that there was room for much more improvement, so I was very eager to hear what the new Static-X sounded like. Wait a second... ""New"" Static-X? Is it really ""new?"" You be the judge. To me, this whole CD is just a rehash of Wisconsin Death Trip and offers nothing new to the listener. I suggest you skip this CD, unless (for some odd reason) you are a die-hard fan. Instead check out some Ministry and White Zombie."
3,2 1/2 really,"What is the dink from Dope doing in Static-X? I swear I turn my back for 1 second and the former guitarist (and much better programmer) is gone, replaced by this guy. Wayne doesn't have the techno beats to keep this sounding fresh, and the songs are far, FAR to slow (c'mon Black and White needs to be twice that speed). The only rays of light are ""Get to The Gone"", and ""This is Not"". ""Ostego Undead"" wouldn't be half bad, considering it has the best sound effects on the cd, but the lyrics bore me to tears, it's just one phrase throught the whole song.This is a poor attempt from a real good industrial/prog band. I just hope the next one is MUCH improved. Don't get this, pick up Wisconsin Death Trip, or just wait for the next release."
4,Static-x:Machine,"Static-x's follow up album to Wisconsin Death Trip is called Machine.It has 12 songs,and 5 of them i like.(""Get To The Gone"",""Black And White"",""This Is Not"",""Cold"",& ""Structural Defect"".)It has a new guitar player (Tripp Edsen;from Dope) and is way heavier than the last.You should buy it."
2,Booooring.,Does nothing to live up to their rep established by 'Wisconsin Death Trip'. It reminds me of a B or even C horror movie. Don't waste your cash.
3,I liked their first CD,"This Cd has one good song. The rest reminds me of random screams and shreiks. I know that that is what I am told about most of my music, but this I would have to agree with. I regret buying the Cd. Perheps one day I will see something good in this Cd, but as of right now this music is too hard for even my likings."
4,Good album,"This album is great and is better than Wisconsin Death Trip. The best songs are ""Cold"" ""Ostego Undead"" ""This is Not"" and ""Get to the Gone"". Still the best place to see or hear Static X is in the live situation because that is where they really rule. I saw this band on the Extreme Steel Tour with Pantera, Slayer and others and they ruled. Unfortunately, the only way to see Static X live now is if you see them with Linkin Park, Staind, and STP. Not my idea of a fun experience. I would suggest skipping the Family Values Tour and wait for Static-X's headlining trek. Buy this album and see Static X live."
4,"Great CD, could be better","let me start off by saying that I bought this cd awhile ago. since then my tatse have changed,but i thought i should write a reveiw anyway.of course the X-men are a frigging great band with a unique sound. thgis cd only proves there greatness, but it suffers from one problem, it gets old. everything on this cd slowy blends together into one song if you listen to it long enough, but that is not a such a bad thing. as i said my tatse have changed a bit from Static-X to bands like Cradle of Filth(new cd damnation and a day is a$$ kikin). that is a bit of a jump but this cd does have the power to stay in my collection in case i need something different.so all in all, a good buy. the good catchy songs and great musicianship(is that spelled right) far out way any bad parts of the cd. LONG LIVE METAL!!!"
2,Not Great...,Ok...I had never heard of Static-X until the FVT. I liked Black and White. The problem with the cd is that nothing else is good on this. This Is Not is good also but this is really weird music. Go out and get Drowning Pool or Puddle of Mudd or download Black and White.
1,The beautiful country of Romania,"I live in a piece of paradise. Romania, a country in Eastern Europe, welcomes all its visitors with great landscapes, great habits, and friendly people, to make you feel just like home. In this amazing land, the beauty of the forests blends perfectly with the richness of the nature itself. Great tall mountains, green hills, the wonderful Black Sea and also one of the most appreciated places in Europe, the awesome Danube Delta.Combine all these incredible landscapes with the rich and praisefull history of our people, or with the exciting and well known myth of Dracula, and you get the picture of a country that's really awesome in all aspects.So what do all these things have to do with Static-X's Machine? Nothing. I just didn't feel like wasting my time and write about the worst album i heard in a really long time... it's not worth it. Don't buy it."
2,Monotonous...lame at its very best,I don't understand why people like this band so much. Every friggin song on this cd sounds the same. Its techno metal trash
4,Industrial,"Many 'slam' static x for vain attempts at being an industrial band. A good friend of mine calls them a 'Poor Fear Factory'.I think this is very unfair. This album, if you like fear factory, is brilliant and well worth listening to."
4,I'm glad to see Static-X have evolved !,"On first hearing the album you will receive one of the feircest musical beat downs delivered from a band in some time . But that is maybe the albums downfall as 'Get to the gone' is by far the best track on the album , the next track 'Permanence' is more poppy but still good and I love the sample used in that track but the next few tracks are just plain dull . 'Black and White' and 'Structural Defect' plain suck .'This is not' , 'Otsego undead'and 's*** in a bag' are all very cool tracks but take more time to grow on you and the title track is also pretty cool if tame compared to the earlier tracks . It's more 'advanced'than the first album but not as instantly likeable , but that's just the way it is with growth in bands , which is welcome as the recent bunch of nu-metal bandsare starting to sound like parrots ."
4,It's No Death Trip...,"With Static-X's debut album ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" being such a success, a second album was eagarly anticipated. ""Machine"" is no doubt a quality release, however in no way lives up to the genius of ""Wisconsin Death Trip"". Tripp, although displaying many inovative talents on guitar, in my opinion doesn't successfully fill the void that Koichi left (I still can't figure out why he left...). Many songs on the album also leave the listener ""hanging"", never really developing or excelling into it's full potential, kinda like a joke with no punch-line. Ken's drums hit harder for more bass (plus), however Tripp is not as heavy as Koichi was, and Wayne's vocals don't display as much variety and range as they did in ""Wisconsin Death Trip"". However ""Machine"" is still a great, dynamic album, but in no way challenges the greatness of ""Wisconsin Death Trip""."
3,Not happy at all.,"I have to say I was extremely disapointed when I picked up this CD. Ok, it's not a bad CD, in fact, it's pretty good. But what I liked about Static when they first came out was that original sound. It was something I had never really experienced and I liked what I heard. I guess when I picked it up I was expecting that same kind of new feeling, but unfortunately not. I mean, don't get me wrong, Static is an awesome band, but I guess they can't be original twice. I also thought the band was better when Koichi was in it. On this album, Wayne plays all the guitar yet for some reason Tripp gets credit for it. (For those of you who don't know, Tripp plays guitar with Dope) Anyway, If you have a choice, pick up Wisconsin Death Trip."
4,My Introduction Into Metal,"Machine was my first true Metal CD. All my friends were into Metal at the time, so I had to pick up something with screaming in it. I eventually picked out Static-X due to them being labeled under the Hard Rock category. I had no previous knowledge of who they were at all. Luckily, this CD turned out to be a very solid purchase.The music on here is full of variety. Most metal bands stick with one style of music and bore your ears as you listen to them. ""Cold"" is a very slow paced song with minimal screaming. ""Machine"" is a very fast paced electronic sounding song. The opening on this CD features circus music followed by pure fast pasted metal music. There is something for any Metal fan on here.At the end of the day, you still need to enjoy Metal music if you expect to enjoy this CD. Anyone else should just shy away from this. The variety kicks this CD up to four stars."
5,what are people talking about,"this Cd is freakin awsome and their are no reasons why some of these people bash Machine, one guy compared it to linkin park, linkin park is NOT METAL, Static X is. It deserves all 5 stars."
5,The energy never stops...!,"I am a HUGE fan of Static-X, their first CD hit me hard--and their next one does just that, but takes you into a deep dark place where everyone forgets they have. It's an awesome album, a must-buy for any metal, techno, or music lover!!"
4,static x,This cd was awsome. it had the screaming of slipknot. crazy drumming and guitar. pesonely i never got the first album. if you liked slipknot or similar things you'll love this
1,passive-aggressive math?,"I've never come across such a work or author before. This author is plainly venting his passive-aggressive tendencies in this less than enlightening work. It took me until page 108 to finally figure what he's up to.There he puts Euclid's axioms in such a format as to be quite deliberately obscure. Then two pages later he suddenly jumps to measuring angles in radians, though he's never done it before and makes no statement that he's doing so. If you are not already ahead of him, you are lost. So it goes with the rest of the book. Meanwhile Berlinski stands to the side saying, ""What did I do? What did I do? Oh, well, perhaps you should read something simpler if you cannot follow me.""Berlinski is plainly a person of wit and intelligence. Alas, he's allowed another side of his persona to pop up here."
1,Basically Garbage,"This book irritated me so much that I'm going to just rant and abandon any hope of writing a 'helpful' review. I picked the book up on a remainder table for $1, and I clearly paid too much. Berlinski doesn't appear to know any more than a smattering of mathematical history (or math for that matter), but he dearly loves to hear himself talk as if he does. His flowery, grandiloquent delivery style accomplishes nothing remotely useful. An example from Chapter two: ""Not until the twentieth century would mathematics and logic, having for so long exchanged their moist breath (sic), fuse ecstatically into the single subject of mathematical logic."" Come on - ""moist breath""?, ""fuse ecstatically""? Nothing is being accomplished here except for the author going on a linguistic ego trip. Other reviewers have commented on the sloppy fact-checking and needlessly obscure presentation of the mathematics, and I agree with every one of those comments. Don't waste your time or money on this clunker."
1,"I like poetry, but ...","I like poetry, but I don't think it works well when writing a book on mathematical history. The point of this book seems to be the showcasing of the author's formidable command of language. OK - now that we know how great the author is in his use of language - what's left? There is some good information, but nothing so extraordinary that it merits the work you have to go through to glean it. SUMMARY: Long on beautiful language, short on information."
1,INFINITE DESENT,"I thought it was my duty to warn all those who either love math or share an interest in the subject to steer clear of this ofering.Berlinski may be a a philospher even a bit of a poet but his short book lacks any substance and yet contains so many factual inaccuracies.If you are interested in the history of math there are many fine books in print:Merzbach & Boyer ""Historty of Mathemematics"" is perhaps the standard work.Victor Katz's book is also excellent.I can also recomend ""What is Mathemattics"" By courant.Even ET Bell's ""Men of mathemematics""Querky as it is .. is worth reading.Also Hogben's ""Mathematics for the million"" has its value.Belinski's book lacks any of the qualities of the above.Glad to say I bought it second hand so I didn't waste too much money.But now I know why a new book was languising in a second hand shop."
2,Factually incorrect,"One of the many facts that the author gets wrong: The Arabic numeral system. No, it was not really invented by the Arabs. It was devised originally by Indians, and adopted later by Arabs.Don't buy this book. Read books like E.T. Bell's ""Men of Mathematics""."
2,Too clever by half,"Math teachers and math writers face a daunting problem. Some subjects are just difficult and some students and some readers just lack the intellectual wherewithal to understand.This problem is made worse when teachers and writers like Berlinski not only undertake a difficult task but add to their burdens and those of their students by taking on one final task, convincing the reader or student just how very smart the teacher or author is.Too often in Infinite Ascent the author goes off on metaphorical tangents which seem little more than ego driven side trips to impress the reader with the brilliance of the author. That he is well read and literate, I have no doubt. I just wish he would put more effort into a better explanation of metamathematics. I still don't get it."
4,Troublemaker *reis),"Another very good WIllie Nelson. I enjoy hearing him sing the old hymns. The mix of songs is very good. If was so nice to listen to a CD with music that appeals to me, music that is fit for all ages to hear. TROUBLEMAKER delivers a mix of good old fashion hymns I grew up listening to on Sunday at the little Baptist Church I went to. I recommend it as a good addition to any music collection."
4,one of my favorites,i first bought this on an 8 track tape in the early 80's i loved it so much i wore it out. i couldn't seem to find it anywhere untill i looked on amazon. i was thrilled to find it there and boughtit. just as great today as it was back then
5,Where there's a Willie there's a way!,"A piece of Willie Kocurek's lovable stories to take home with you! I have heard Willie speak and his book comes to life with his wonderful stories! I could actually see him as a child stomping the sauerkraut!Thanks, Willie, for sharing your life and your wisdom with us. We should all strive to be like you!"
5,Christian horror has finally come,"With Chayatocha, talented author Shane Johnson has proven that Christian fiction and horror are not incompatible. It's about time! Johnson has tackled some intriguing subjects in the past, and this novel doesn't disappoint. Recommend Chayatocha to readers who enjoy Stephen King or Dean Koontz."
3,not bad,"Contrary to the reviews already written, I thought the story began well but tended to fade somewhat nearing the middle as it became almost cartoonish in nature. It began with ample suspense but couldn't hold it and I found I lost interest too early on, finishing the book simply because I wanted to end it. Starts off believably but loses momentum and ends satisfactorily in my opinion"
5,"Scary, but a fun, wild ride!","This book was very Hitchcock in nature. Fun-scary, and I loved it. Definitely one that will keep you looking for red eyes in the dark, but a good swift read if that's what you're after!"
3,Producer ruins a decent album,"It's nice to hear Duncan Sheik emerging from his Nick Drake inspired funk and returning to pop territory. The material is well written and well performed. Unfortunately the producer must have decided that Sheik's vocal intonation wasn't spot-on and he used ""auto-tune"" technology to compensate. So instead of listening to Sheik's vocal pitch swoop and vary a little, we hear the notes electronically snap into place (ala Cher's ""Do You Believe In Love"" single a couple of year back).I can understand a producer wanting to fix a bad note here and there, but the over-use of this technique makes this album sound unnatural and, alas, unlistenable.Human's don't have perfect intonation, and just because you can now enforce perfect intonation with studio gear doesn't mean you are improving the performance.Come on, guys...let the man sing!"
4,"this is an ""I like it all"" cd","when i listen to this cd i have a trip. this is one of those cds that i can listen from beginning to end and i like it all. not too much rithm, but a it's got deepness. a not so commercial side of Duncan Sheik with good quality and enjoyable art."
3,"Good three songs, the rest sounds all the same to me","So i heard about all the reviews aplauding Sheik, and I decided to give him a try. I loved Genius, Half Life, and Good Morning, but I didn't think the rest of the songs were too good, there was no distinct melody line, and the songs aren't something you can constantly sing too. It's good for sleeping though, so turn it on when you wanna relax."
2,Nate,"Oh. Dear. God.I am a huge Duncan Sheik fan, don't get me wrong, but I loved him for his singing, the amazing melodies he pulled of with that voice of his. This album is horrible, it is far overly produced with cheezy pop crap in the backgroud. POP SUCKS. Pop is the devil incarnate, I am extremely dissapointed in Duncan for ""returning"" as so many of you say to a pop world that he was never in. Barely Breathing doesn't come close to the popiness of this pile of junk. Please. Dear. God. Revert back to Humming, his absolute masterpiece of an album.Nick Drake is a god."
1,Daylight a Duncan Dissappointment.,"Simply put, I found this cd lacking and pandering to commercialism. It has none of the depth, the beauty, the poetry of his first three cds. The music is flat and not as intricate and innovative as his previous effots. If he is looking for commercial success and mass appeal, I wish him well. Me, I will continue play his first three cds and hope that Daylight was just a fluke."
5,This is THE ONE!,"I own and adore every one of Mr. Sheik's albums, but Daylight is the one that I love the most. It is thought-provoking, upbeat, and extremely fun to listen to. There is not one bad song on the album. I'm glad Mr. Sheik created something a bit more mainstream without sacrificing the qualities that make him one of the most important singers-songwriters of our time. Not to mention, the man is just a downright nice guy. My friends and I had the pleasure of chatting with him after his Carson Daly performance, and the media exposure he is getting for Daylight hasn't gone to his head a bit. He is still the nice guy he was when I got to meet him on his Phantom Moon tour, which says a lot about how much he loves his fans. So, go out and buy Daylight! It is a great investment."
4,Night Music for Those in a Reverie,"Well, it took me a few days to get into Sheik's latest groove but it's easy to admit this CD stands way high above most others produced in 2002. Amid sounds reminiscent of Indigo Girls, Pilot, and David Sylvian, comes a new kind of mood music: night reverie. Don't let the front photo fool you; this is quiet passion with honesty stamped all across it. Like the blood and wine tones floating through the inside cover, or a world music club where someone forgot to put out the 'No Smoking' sign, the songs draw you in slowly, surprising you with a first layer of candidness, and finally revealing and reprising an emotion one doesn't expect in world weary: surprised joy, in spite of what has happened in the past and may happen again. For the realists and optimists alike..."
2,Maybe It's Me....,"Maybe it's me, but I'm not too happy with this disc. It's not terrible, but it lacks any excitement. I've listened to it a few times in an attempt to give it a chance, but it doesn't get better with subsequent listens. There needed to be a few more livelier songs to mix things up. Not to mention, that I'm now convinced that he's a Michael Franks fan with the inclusion of the song ""Memento."" Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it would have fit perfectly on one of Franks' releases."
5,This an amazing CD,"I bought Duncan's 1st album and loved both his voice and the music. I read a review of ""Daylight"" in People magazine, and it was rated highly, so I bought it. I love this CD. It has been in my car since it first came out and I only take it out to listen to it at work or at home. Duncan is a wonderful songwriter and musician. And easy on the eyes....!"
4,Great easy listen but meaningful lyrics,The music and the lyrics are a great contradiction. You'll have fun with this.
4,Sheik is Chic again!,"What I like about this album is it's growing on me.I have profound respect for art that takes time toreach it's listener. Duncan is a lyricist you haveput on when you reach his level of conscienceness (sp).That means- that even something like Phantom Moon maynot grab you when your 21 but may when become 35, richor poor, lonely or in love. Not everything has to beeasily absorbed on the first listen, nor ever.The music here though is his most attractive since his first offering on Atlantic. Enjoy!"
1,Not Sudanese Music !,This CD is of Sundanese music from the South Pacific Island of Sunda. It has nothing to do with Sudan.
1,Toxic Yoga Mat,"The smell from this yoga mat is toxic! I'm not sure why my experience was so much worse than the other reviewers, but I cannot recommend this mat. I tried airing out the mat outdoors (couldn't for more than a few hours as I live in a harsh winter climate, it was snowing, and am apartment city dweller) and washed it twice, but NOTHING would get rid of the smell. The smell made my sinuses burn and swell. HORRIBLE!!!! I ended up throwing it out because it was making me ill.Perhaps if you lived somewhere where you could keep the mat outdoors for several days, this would not be an issue for you. Unfortunately, this was not an option for me."
3,A man revealed,"I found this book very illuminating. I never would have guessed that Alan Rickman's true personality is so different from his many screen personas. It was very interesting that his role in Truly, Madly, Deeply is close to his real life.Being an American, I found some of the abbreviations and idioms hard to translate. It was nice that the author included some pictures of Alan Rickman in the paperback book.I hope that some day Mr. Rickman will write his own memoirs so that we can see his life in his own words."
2,The man it writes of hates it.,"Though there may be information within this book on Alan Rickman's acting career, I offer simply his own words to a fan when presented with this book to sign his autograph to: ""I do not sign that awful book.""So, Rickmaniacs, be warned; he hates the book."
1,What the Hell??,"If you enjoy Alan Rickman as an actor, Do Not Buy This Book. It is badly written, jumps from subject to subject, repetitive blobs to fill space, and plenty of unrelated ""quotes"" from no one in particular. I now know way much about Mr. Rickman's, early next door neighbor's 3rd cousin now. Being an American, she happily does not supply definitions for British words and organizations. To add insult to injury, Maureen Paton seems to believe that she can connect his personality to his hair style and that the two of them have ""much in common."" Buy the time I was half way done (where I stopped reading) Alan Rickman is rendered as the most Pompous Ass on the planet. Is she a fan???"
1,My apologies to Alan Rickman,"Even 1 star is too much for this awful book. It is quite painfully bad. I am amazed that this book was published at all and I would discourage anyone from buying it. It is poorly written and has absolutely nothing to offer but lame attempts at ""dirt"" (Alan Rickman gets annoyed once in a while. Oh, the horror!), cheap innuendos and out-of-context quotes from friends and/or enemies.A book like this is a terrible price to pay for celebrity and I am embarassed to admit that I have read it. Sorry, Alan."
1,Maureen's Drivel,"I picked up this book as I am a great admirer of Alan Rickman's career and was sorely disappointed within the first paragraph. The technique, if that's what the jerky, scattered smattering of unrelated sentences and half formed ideas can be called, resembled nothing close to a decent flow or form. In one sentence the author makes a point blank statement then, in the next, proceeds to contradict it in a way that makes me believe she was oblivious to the first statement.Not only is her writing style appallingly primitive (and no amount of the thirteen letter words she seemed fond of sprinkling through out the text can hid that fact)but the voice she used to recant this cobbling of rumors and third hand reports bears all the resemblance of a jilted lover.This mockery was written seemingly without respect for the person but rather as a way to make a profit off of a talented man who prefers to not exploit himself the way this hack seemed to have no qualms in doing."
1,"If You're a Fan, DON'T!!!!!","If you are truly a fan of Alan Rickman's -- or just interested in him as a wonderful actor -- run, don't walk, AWAY from this offensive drivel!I am not even going to dignify this tripe with a lengthy review...even a NEGATIVE one (and, if you haven't guessed by now, this IS a negative review). If, indeed, the man is to have an unauthorized biography, let it be worthy of him, and not this nonsense."
1,This book even gives tabloid a good name,"The reason there is no input from the man himself is because he hates this book. For the Harry Potter fans, I think this book levels with the writings of Rita Skeeter. Wikipedia has a better bio than this book."
5,Great Chocolate!,"If you love chocolate, this is some of the best on the planet. Great with a nice Cabernet."
3,Honest self appraisal,"Starks does a good job here detailing his life and whats most rewarding is his confession of his errors and failures on and off the court. That is this book's strong points.There are good photos here.John discussing some of the nutty fans who stalked him is a good read and my personal favorite is his story of the first time he drives his mother and grandmother thru Manhattan traffic, weaving in and around the taxis. The description of what was going on with the two women had melaughing.The weakness of this book is the dvd that is included with it.John should have paid someone a little bit more money to produce this thing a little better. And throughout the book, he repeats a lot of the bad stuff that happened to his brothers over and over again. Hos co-writer should have edited that a little bit better.Hopefully John will coach the Knicks one day. If you're a Knicks fan, then read this book."
5,Clarity for Morality,"Pinckaers very clearly and concisely shows that Christian morality is about fulfilling our longing for happiness, excellence, joy, and truth. The end is not merely to obey commandments but rather to obey commandments in order to be truly happy. The power to walk that path of obedience comes not from dry logic but from the gifts of the Holy Spirit that animate the virtues of a Christian. Most telling is Pinckaers' distinction between mere pleasure and joy as two radically different conceptions of happiness. Many of our life-changing moral decisions come down to the choice between transient, superficial pleasure that is illusory and ends in bitterness and even hatred, while true happiness is, in the words of Augustine, ""joy born of the truth"" (p. 77). Pinckaers describes the path of happiness that ends in lasting joy, not the path of mere pleasure ending in disappointment."
2,Comments by a satisfied reader,"Scholarly and credible. Be ready to spend some time with this book, and have a dictionary handy if you are not familar with the philosophy and theology of morality."
4,"Hello, I love this.","I've heard alot of complaints about yet another ""Doors"" collection being out, but I'm glad this one is, because it's easily the best one ever. It's 2 CD's, 34 tracks, remastered, in chronological order, with one unreleased song, in a slim-case, and best of all, it's ""The Doors"". I can't even complain about what's missing because almost nothing is. It has 8 songs from the debut alone. Not only does this include all the expected hits, but it includes many great lesser known songs as well. Also, the booklet is stuffed with info and photos. Once you listen to this collection, you'll want to ""Tell All The People"" how great it is."
1,Am I losing my mind?,I bought this cd twice because I want this collection but Celebration of the Lizard IS MISSING even though this website labels it.Am I the only one that sees this? How can I get the correct version with Celebration of the Lizard on it?
1,"Where are ""Other Voices"" and ""Full Circle""?","For the REAL fan, it would be more intersting those two albums, instead of the same versions of the same songs of the six original studio albums with Jim Morrison. By the way, I don't think that these compilations are ""THE BEST"", as if lacks better and important tunes. It's better to spend more and have the original six albums.By the way, I only have an old tape of ""Full Circle"" and I have never heard or seen ""Other Voices"". These two albums SHOULD been CD's. I know more fans would buy them than these compilation."
5,this cd lights my fire !!!!!!!!,"wow this cd rocks,the lirycs are pure poetry buy this cd (in amazon.com of course) you will love it the doors are one of the best bands ever the voice of jim morrison is great the keyboard is asbsolutely great buy this cd ..... and rock and roll !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Needed one more!,"I love Legacy and I think it is the greatest compilation yet of the Doors(and there have been many). With Rhino being involved in this, you know it will be a good product. Some of the best liner notes ever written about the Doors experience. However, I only have one complaint- Why was Blue Sunday omitted after Peace Frog? When I bought the album, I thought it was possible they were considering it one song. No Blue Sunday here and I really missed it while playing the second disc. It is like listening to Heartbreaker by Led Zep with no Living Loving Maid to follow up or Sgt. Pepper and no A Little Help From my Friends after. The Celebration should have been left out in favor of a couple of other mentioned songs and one of their most beautiful-Blue Sunday! I guess I will just have to get my fix from Morrison Hotel."
3,"good music, but...","I debated which Doors CD to buy, choosing this one thinking it was the best bargain. Probably not a wise decision. The music is fine, takes you right back to the 60s-70s. There is extra stuff I have never heard before, mostly profanity that does not add anything to the music at all, and the long prose called Celebration of the Lizard. The album liner is the most disturbing part, with the author feeling the need to explain in endless,excruciating detail,(peppered with foul language and hate) just how the music affected him. In hindsight, I would have been better off with 1 or 2 of my favorite CDs instead of this compilation."
3,"Not exactly the band's ""absolute best""","Some of the very best Doors songs are missing from this collection: ""You're Lost, Little Girl"", ""Love Street"", ""The Soft Parade"", ""Ship of Fools"". Instead, seven-or-so minutes is wasted on disc two with ""Celebration of the Lizard"", an interesting outtake, but hardly among the band's ""absolute best"". And though ""Wishful Sinful"", included here, was a minor hit, it was also something of a minor song; ""Take It As It Comes"", not included here, was both a bigger hit and a better song.This collection does however feature good remastering."
1,wow,"The lead singer's song delivery is quite mopey. The keyboard solos are rather pedestrian, but was way ahead of it's time, it's match for match with ""free jazz"" and japanese noise. The guitarist is quite talented and to be honest, the rest of the band weighs down his true potential. The song ""Riders in the Storm"" is a good Exhibit A on why a band should not record whilst taking barbituates."
5,"YO PEEP GAME YALL, MASTA ACE IS DA PHATTEST","THIS SINGLE IS TIGHT, BUT YOU SHOULD CHECK THE MASTA ACE INCORPORATED CD, SITTIN ON CHROME ITS GREAT FOR BUMPIN IN YO RIDE"
5,Excellent collection,I was very impressed with this collection..Package was heavy not just a dvd but a book included..Well worth the money
5,Beatles Help Deluxe Edition,"Fantastic 2 dvd Deluxe set of the Beatles Help.I'm a big Beatles fan and got this for a great price from Amazon,well worth it."
4,Ah Help!,"Help! The Beatles second and lesser film. But hey, it's the Beatles. I just wish they had given them more to say. The music's groovy of course. The color looks great. I just wanted more of their native wit, ya know? So four stars instead of five. Sorry Fab fans. A Hard Day's Night I could watch over and over, this one, maybe I'll give it another viewing in a couple of years. Nice extras but again, I just wanted more."
2,"Ringo, please seek help!!!","After watching this movie I am now convinced...Ringo Starr is an absolutely terrible actor. His bad acting ruined this movie for me. In the original version of Help, Mr. Starr had a cow in his room so he could drink warm milk. I'm glad they edited out that scene because it was not even remotely funny.Apart from Mr. Starr's acting, George Harrison delivers a tremendous performance. I think it's hilarious when George Harrison is skiing with a top hat on his head.Also, the title track is superb.If the producers can edit out all of the scenes with Ringo Starr, this will by a 5-star movie."
2,help??,"I apologize to the beatles fans, I said no story in this film and the film had no sense at all. The beatles were a good accepted band but they couldn't act in the film.They never become a huge film star! the whole story in the film is like a story book children and absolutely childish, though bonus with some nice songs too.... need I say more?"
1,No Story and it makes no sense,"Some fans gush over this film because its the Beatles,but there is no story at all.They try to imitate the charm of A Hard days Night,but it doesn't work.As I watched the last scene on the beach when people just chased each other and then......they just chased each other some more,I thought ""what a waste of time"".It's as though they turned up and said ""turn the cameras on and we'll just improvise"".Nothing happens and there is no real ending,but there was no coherent story to start with!When it was first released,the critics panned it and with good reason.It is a terrible film and I am a big Beatles fan so there is no bias here.The only good thing is the music.Buy it only if you are nostalgic."
1,no story and childish,"I apologize to the beatles fans, I said no story in this film and the film had no sense at all. The beatles were a good band but they couldn't act in the film.They never become a huge film star! the whole story in the film is like a story book children and absolutely childish, though bonus with some nice songs too.... need I say more?"
2,"Really, really, really silly","This film is so silly (even by Beatles standards), it's almost unwatchable. There's not enough music (or at least their good music) in the movie and the silliness just takes control and causes the movie to hit the ground at 500 miles per hour.A much better movie is Hard Days' Night. It's silly too, but the music overrides most of it and makes it a pleasure to watch.It looks like about 15 people tried to write this mess. Are there funny parts? Yes. Is some of the music good? Yes. Is it worth renting? Probably.But, don't buy it. Unless you are a hardcore Beatles fan, you'll only watch it once."
2,Help! This movie is a mess!,"The only good thing about this movie are the Beatles themselves. The plot(and I'm being generous when I call it that ) is very weak and not funny. If everything else could be edited out except when the Beatles are either performing or on screen by themselves then we would have something watchable. It is way too scripted. The Beatles are at their best just being themselves as in a ""Hard Days Night"""
1,Embarrassing,"I'm a big Beatles fan and I saw Help in the theaters when it was first released. I don't remember my reaction to it much, but I'm sure I loved it since it was such a thrill to see the Beatles in any circumstance. Of course, the music was great, even though it was lip-synched. I rented Help recently and I have to tell you, I couldn't even finish watching it. It's a horrible movie. The attempts at humor fall flat and the Beatle just seem too old to be acting like such immature goofballs. Do yourself a favor, keep your childhood memories, watching this will only ruin them for you."
2,"For odd British humor, I'll stick with the Pythons","I guess I'm one of those mean people that some other reviewers on this page have referred to. I didn't like this movie, although I do like the Beatles and enjoyed all of the songs that are featured in it. I appreciate zany, bizarre humor as much as anyone. I don't necessarily ask for a comedy to be logical or even coherent, particularly when the filmmakers are shooting for such a quirky type of humor. However, it should be funny, and the simple fact is that this film didn't make me laugh. What can I say?"
3,A great Elvis movie,"A few quips, some jump cuts and a few arch scene transition titles do not offset my impression that here is an above average Elvis exploitation movie starring the Beatles. Somehow, I never saw this one until now. It's not remotely comparable to ""A Hard Day's Night."" The silly plot about an Indian death cult trying to recover one of Ringo's rings wears thin fast. Still, it's delightful to see the Fab Four in restored, glorious color. The songs are great, but are just gratuitously stuck in every 10 minutes with no relation to the plot. Worse, the Beatles don't bother to even pretend to be playing along. They are out of synch, especially Ringo who doesn't bother to stay on the beat, his cymbals flailing every which way, his drums set up in absurd locations like some rocks at the beach or a military plain. Film looks like it was just duped yesterday, though, thanks to the great restoration. Thankfully, you can cue just the songs on the menu and skip the filler in between."
2,Great Music! Bad Movie!,"I am a Beatles Fan & enjoy listening to their music. However, this being said, I thought the movie, ""Help!"" wasn't very good. It was a combination music video of the The Beatles performing their various songs in different locations and a movie about a group of evil religious zealots trying to steal one of Ringo's rings.""Help!"" is a really artsy film, where we see crazy, unrealistic antics happening repeatedly by all the cast members. The acting is bad in this film and the storyline is silly throughout. The music, costuming & make-up are the only redeeming features in this film."
2,All you need is cash!,"I love the Beatles, but I also love paying the rent. I would have given more than two stars to the film, but unfortunately, I can't afford five."
3,The Night Before and Another Girl,"The singing scenes of this movie are worth remembering and each time you see them, these guys glisten. Theres George Harrison singing ""I Need You"" very well. This is definitely a very unserious movie but much of it a classic to keep. ""Another Girl"" belongs to Paul McCartney, he sings it way cool and draws the line. Ringo is royal to the beat. John Lennon is naughty and inquisitive. These guys never let me down. They're just a downright great band and fascinating!"
3,Here's What's in the Deluxe Edition...,"So for an extra $75 you get (in addition to the two DVDs):* a reproduction of Richard Lester's original annotated script* 8 reproductions of the original theatrical lobby cards* a reproduction of the Theatrical movie poster* a 60-page book with rarely seen photographs and production notes from the movie. Both the deluxe book and the standard booklet feature an introduction by Richard Lester and an appreciation by Martin Scorsese.No doubt it's the book that bumped the price up so much. My rating is temporary, only because it's not out at the time I wrote the review. Most likely a nice (albeit pricey) holiday gift for the die hard Beatles collector.Unanswered questions: why not a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD high-def release? What mixes are provided of the soundtrack? And why are LET IT BE and several other Beatles films still unreleased on home video (as of late 2007)?"
4,Help is on the way,"I remember this film when it came out originally - we were excited to see it in color!This remastering looks amazing and the care with filters that director, Richard Lester and DP put into it is more obvious - eye candy and lots of fun.The songs are great and sound really clear and pristine.Extras are here (not as many as the over-priced, collector's edition), not too plentiful, but fun to see the cut scene story and behind the scenes documentary."
2,what th'???!!!??,"I loved ""Pleh"" when it first came out and I have it on DVD. I watch it about once a year. This DVD set is a rip-off. You pay BIG BUCKS for some lousy cards and a ""script"" and a few other worthless trinkets.Whoopee.What I want to know is: WHERE IN THE H*** IS THE ""OFFICIAL"" RE-ISSUE DVD set of ""LET IT BE""/""GET BACK""?????!?!!??!!?I would think that is of more value than a fancy re-issue of ""Help"".The bootleg market would attest to that!!GET IT TOGETHER,EMI/APPLE (or whomever)!!!The two stars are for the rip-off nature of the ""Help"" DVD set,not for the film...the film is a 3.5 for me."
5,A real Golden Oldie!,"I know that some people my age(eleven) would think it's funny that I think a movie that doesn't have one of the current heart-throbs in it is worth seeing, but it's true, it's really good."
4,Ouch!,"A great fun movie starring the fabs in their second film, although ""A Hard Day's Night"" is the better of the two! O.K. Could the viewer from New York (October 5th) get his facts right! George Martin DID produce the ""Help!"" album, Ringo came up with the title for ""A Hard Days Night"", ""Help!"" (The movie) was originaly to be called ""Eight Arms To Hold You"" not ""Eight Days A Week"", and John Lennon wrote ""Help!"" independently from the idea of the movie! O.K.!"
2,Problems with second dvd,"I have had the special dvd set for two months and just now watched it. I put in disc two, which is labeled disc two and got the movie all over again with the chapter selection menu not working properly. Has anyone else had similar problems?"
4,Forgive Me For Liking It,"No, it's not as authentic as A Hard Days Night, yes the Beatles were high during the majority of the filming, but come on...it's the BEATLES. It's just them in a very Monkee-esque fashion, with Ringo as the star, singing some great tunes along the way. You can't call yourself a fan if you don't at least hum along..."
3,DTS 5.1 Surround,The DVD HELP!Audio Options:DTS 5.1 SurroundPCM StereoNo Dolby Digital 5.1 SurroundHmm
1,Can't Wait to Not Buy It,"Once is enough for this film - basically an extended music video with an idiotic plot but fantastic music. Long before the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" low budget idiocy (but yet again, fantastic music) we had this nonsense. Why is ""Let It Be"" still not on DVD, yet we get this repackaged yet again? It's your money...spend it wisely."
2,"Frankly, This Movie Stinks","The Beatles were at the height of their fame when this movie was made, so it was guaranteed to get big box office, which it did. A Hard Days' Night was excellent, this sorry excuse for a follow-up is an abomination. There are a few funny scenes and of course the music is good, although the lip-synching and pretend instrumentation are reminiscent of The Partridge Family. John Lennon is clearly overweight and they all look like they're half-stoned alot of the time. I'm a Beatle fan, but this is a clunker. It's not that it hasn't aged well. It wasn't good to begin with. Pass."
5,Fab 4 do it again!!!!,If you like A Hard Days Night you will love this movie. I thought it was the most funniest thing I have ever seen in my life. I love the 5 ways they try to get the ring of Ringo. This is a classic to add to the Beatles fame. I am only 14 and I love it even though I didn't grow up during the 60's.
4,why so cheap?,I remember when this DVD set sold for about $179.00; I purchased it new from Amazon for $29.95. I'd like to know: why so cheap? Was it a mistake? It's now selling for $80.00 on this site.....feels like the stock market to me.
3,HELP! (Deluxe Edition),"Bought this at the beginning of the month on one of the Gold Box sales....Had to take advantage of it as i wanted the Deluxe Set but didn't want to pay the big $$$$.. As it turns out that was a great move as i just don't think this thing is worth $120.00.. Don't get me wrong , i love the band , i love the movies , but the extras weren't all that exciting...."
5,HELP! Review,"I saw this movie as a kid numerous times, and it was always an event for my brother and I when it came on TV. The VHS release was pretty murky looking, and so was the MPI DVD release. This one looks pretty damn good. Even better is the outstanding audio quality. I've never heard these HELP! songs sound cleaner, fresher or clearer. I highly recommend for the Beatle fan."
1,HELP needs HELP,"I bought HELP for my son for Christmas. He is starting a collection of clean, good Beatle memorabilia. When he opened it Christmas morning his disappointment was heart breaking. The box is stained and worn. It is not in good condition as claimed."
5,LIMITED COPIES,IVE READ THAT THIS WILL BE A VERY LIMITED EDITION. HOW MANY COPIES? THE LAST THING I READ WAS 25000 COPIES IN THE USA THUS THEIR JUSTICATION OF THE PRICE. ITS STILL TOO HIGH BUT IM SUCH SUCKER ER... FAN IM GETTING IT ANYWAY.
2,yes right they were bad actors,"...they were not trying to do a good act in the film, but they were trying to be a bad actor because they were not prefering the oscar prize.only for beatles fans, if u like them! the songs are okay but the acting is terrible and dumb!..."
5,AWESOME!,IT'S LIKE WATCHING A BRAND NEW MOVIE! AWESOME! JUST AS FUNNY AS WHEN I WAS A KID! CLEAR AS A BELL AND SOUNDS GREAT! ANY BEATLES FAN WILL LOVE THIS!!
1,bad dvd,"Rec'd this DVD in May (2010) It stopped playing in August. The DVD player says ""no disc"" when I try to play it. It didn't last very long for the money I paid for it.Not very happy with this purchase."
2,Great movie but...,"Obviously this is a fantastic movie, but what about the DVD? Well, honestly, the quality is pretty bad. The film transfer isn't very pretty, it's in FULL SCREEN as opposed to its original widescreen ratio, and the sound quality is an insult for any music-based film, let alone The Beatles.[...]Also, this version has zippo extras. A Hard Days' Night has some nice bonus features, so surely the next Help! DVD will, as well.Hold off 'till we get the good version! Just dust off your old copy of Help! on VHS, 'cos this version literally is no better."
4,What's with the price of this DVD?,"This is a movie I'll watch over and over. But until they bring the price of the DVD down to a reasonable figure, it'll be my old VHS tape that I'll be watching. There's way too much cashing in on the Beatles going on."
5,They are so funny!,"Man that movie rocked and rolled me. They were so full and witty back in the early 60's. The movie rocked, I can't get over it. My favorite part was when they are trying to get Ringo's rind in the bathroom. All I have to say about that is ""Hu ho. Ho. Ho."""
1,Here I stand head in hand---,"Another con job of a Beatles film-to-dvd release--Is it true this has an improperly CROPPED screen image? WHY are so many people obsessed with filling their wide screen TV's by cropping image area off of composed motion picture frames? Enough! This entices studios to fu&k with presentation when released to home video. The BLACK BARS mean you get the ENTIRE image (i.e, MORE) that the director intended... ""technology"" has it's disadvantages"
2,No Dolby Digital 5.1?????? WTF????,"I cannot believe the new HELP! DVD issue only has a stereo and a DTS 5.1 mix. WHERE'S THE DOLBY DIGITAL????? More people have DD capability than DTS!!! They could have included BOTH!!! What gives? Some kind of licensing issue?The movie is beautiful of course and yes, the stereo mix sounds wonderful, but I was looking forward to listening to the new 5.1 mixes and now after spending almost $100 I can't!!!!!! Now I have to go and find a bootleg CD to hear them.VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
5,Help me from idiots.,"Nothing to say here, but what's alredy stated. I'm just extremely grateful to be enjoying this movie the way it was always mean't to be enjoyed. Richard Lester is the most under-rated director of all time."
5,Well...,"This is absolutely, hands down, worth every penny and unless you can't afford it, you would be a fool if you don't buy this Deluxe Edition set. Remember, there are only EVER going to be 25,000 copies."
3,Where's the beef?,"Isn't there a scene that wasn't used for the film of one song? Seems I remember this as being in the DVD ""The Making of A Hard Days Night"". I'm a huge Beatle fan, but having all the material already, 'cept for the 5.1 mix, seems too pricey to me. Where's the extra's??? Seems there should be much more for this price."
5,Don't Take Yourselves So Seriously - Help is GREAT!,"I've seen a lot of complaints on here that the storyline is stupid and incoherant and the acting is bad. I have just one thing to say in reply. Don't take things so seriously! This film is GREAT if you're looking to relax. We all know the music is the greatest and the storyline, although a bit silly, is packed with great jokes.Forget good film making and just let yourselves be carried on this crazy, worldwide adventure with the world's greatest band. You can't help but laugh along with the film!"
4,Not quite Hard Day's Night - Part 2,"Help! isn't quite as funny as Hard Day's Night perhaps because they actually had a ""solid story line"". While HDN had a script it seemed to have matched the true Beatles' sense of humor and style. Help! is quite good in it's own right but don't expect a sequel to Hard Day's Night"
5,great- and funny,i bought this movie just because im a huge beatles fan and wanted to see them play their songs. i got that and much more. this movie was very funny to my surprise. if your into the beatles or not you will like this movie.
2,gute lieder aber die Handlung ist unfähig,"their songs like ticket to ride, help, another girl are ok but the acting is bad."
5,Help! This Movie Is Great!,"I liked how this movie was in color, set aside from the other Beatles movie that was released in black and white, ""A Hard Day's Night"" to be certain. The Beatles had so many great songs in this film, songs that are featured on their album ""Help!"" such as the title song, and other great hits like ""Another Girl,"" ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl,"" ""Ticket To Ride,"" ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,"" and ""I Need You."" The songs are all in their original recordings as is on the ""Help!"" album, released in 1965. A must-have for any and all die-hard Beatles fans of all ages!!!"
2,Help! - Deluxe Defect,I'm a collector so I had to have the deluxe edition. I faithfully pre-ordered it and received it in the mail only to discover that my Disk 2 with all the bonus material is really another copy of disk 1 but labeled as disk 2. I'm wondering if anyone else has the same problem.
5,also got one at Best Buy for 99 cents!,"This was deal of the year, my Best Buy had this awesome box set on clearence for 99 cents! (sadly it's no longer available at that price)This set is great, the only prob I have is the two discs are held in the book by foam rubber holders and the can scratch easily.The two books one with the movie info and photos and the 2 discs, and a really cool reproduction of the Help! shootong script (origianlly titled ""Beatles Two"")This set is a monster, it weighs like 5 lbs!A must for fans of the movie!"
2,WHY SO EXPENSIVE!?!?,"I dont understand why the price on the deluxe version is so high. I could understand if it came with a remixed ""Help"" soundtrack cd/dvd set in 5.1 with bonus outtakes and the singles, and maybe a t-shirt, or the ""Live At Shea"" dvd remastered, but all we are getting is a photo book, lobby cards, script reproduction, and a poster! No mention of the original mono soundtrack either which is ridiculous considering that the previous vhs/dvd release also had the stereo mix. The Led Zeppelin ""Song Remains The Same"" collector's edition at least comes with a t-shirt and the soundtrack cd remixed/remastered, and it's only $27.99!Are these at least numbered limited editions ?"
5,"Funny, Hilarious, Goofy, Crazy, Beatlish, Wow!","This movie is AWESOME. My favorite part is after the scene where the boys' shirts get half-ripped-off, and George and John are 'laughing', going ""Ho. Hoho...hohohoho."" Hilarious stuff! I love George the absolute best out of the Beatles, and I loooove the I Need You scene. They are totally in the exact spot I wish I lived in. :) I love the movie, and the whole thing is awesome. Sooooo funny!"
2,"Cute then, Dumb now","As a person who's about the same age as the Beatles, I was an enthusiastic fan at that time. I still like to listen to their music occasionally. This movie was a trip when it was released. That's because everyone in the world was hungry for anything the Beatles put out. Forty years later, it's just plain dumb. I tried sitting through this thing with my 11, 12, & 14 year old grandkids, but even they couldn't stomach it."
1,no special features,I was so thrilled to buy this for my daughter who is the biggest Beatle fan. Everything seemed great until we went to watch disc 2 and it the same as 1 but labeled 2. Hence no special features. I'm sure this can't be the only one like this. I'm in the middle of an exchange with Amazon. I hope it's cleared up soon. I guess it would have been better to buy in person so the exchange could be done that way too. So much for saving money. D. K.
2,Uninspired silliness,"Disjointed, sophomoric, and joyless, ""Help!"" is a major step back from the far more satisfying ""A Hard Day's Night"".The movie's only saving grace is its music, but you may find yourself getting really restless waiting for the next musical number to begin."
2,A lot of fluff.,"I bought this set for my Mom who is a big Beatles fan and she really wasn't impressed. There's a lot of 'memorabilia' type stuff, but she said the movie really isn't very good, and she'd much rather just listen to the music than watch the movie or read the song notes, or look at pictures of them. If you're big into collectibles, and memorabilia, this is definitely for you, just wasn't for my Mom, and I wasn't too impressed either."
3,Pleases Me,"The first of the Beatles colour cinematic outings, Help actually is quite funny.Co-starring the late great Leo McKern (better know outside the USA), the Beatles are pursued by a religious sect after a sacred ring which just happens to be on 'you-know-who's' finger.I'm surprised though that this is so expensive!"
1,Never received,"Through and error in address and incompetence with my local post office, I never received this DVD. I did try to investigate on my own and told my friend who ordered it for me that I received it. She really would not know what to do if she had to try to trace it. So I am leaving the matter unattended. I most likely will order again because I wanted this movie and it was a birthday gift to me from my internet ""sister"". If Amazon wants to contact me, I can give them the postal # and claim # for verification. Am a big Beatles fan."
3,The Beatles HELP needs a bit of help,"Giving it three stars for the music. I'm afraid the movie itself hasn't stood the test of time. The story line is typical for a farce/spoof, but the script lets it down badly.I remember it being so much funnier - but then the last time I saw it was when it first came out. Despite the disappointment with this aspect of the dvd, I must say it was worth every penny for the music. Took me back to their glory days - and mine. If you love their music, buy it and disregard the movie - you just can't get dvd's of their concerts, and if you could all you'd be able to hear would be screaming anyway."
2,Good Movie But Capital's Pricing Is Bad,"We all love the Beatles and HELP is a wonderful film with fun music. The problem I have with this product is the price, once I saw the price I had to yell Help!. Capital must think that their packaging justifies the high price think again, we are the suckers they are trying to fleece. Please don't purchase this product unless the price comes way down."
3,"Different from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, but not bad","If you're a Beatles fan and also if you aren't, you should buy Help! because it shows you once more how big were those four youngsters from Liverpool.If you've seen you, you might say something like ""since when these musicians became actors?"", and you may right, but it still shouldn't change the fact that this movie is a good one, but different from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, for example. If you haven't seen this one and already saw A HARD DAY'S NIGHT or THE FIRST U.S VISIT, you may be dissapointed after you'll see this one. However, I reccomend you to take this one. You may regret, but not for long."
4,It's the Beatles!,"There isn't that much left to be said...the Beatles and their songs are what you buy this movie for...it certainly isn't for the acting or the story. It is a bit like watching an extended music video; the songs are draped across the plot here and there, and the plot often is there to support the songs. My 4-year old loves it and dances around and around when the title song comes on, and with a couple of the other songs, and I confess I get up and dance with her. The restoration of this 40+-year old movie is really, really good and as a Beatles fan, I sure appreciate and applaud the work that was done."
5,Help,"It has been a long time since I saw Help, but thoroughly enjoyed just as much this time as I did the first time. Absolutely worth buying."
3,why was my review removed ??,"I wrote that if one can deal with PAL versions of this set , one can seek it at Amazon UK for about $20.00 cheaper. Sorry if that upset the USA Amazon but its true. But don't worry I'm buying the stripped down version as even about $80.00 still seems a slap in the fans face to me and I'm buying it in the good old USA :)"
5,Great Intro to Increasing you metabolism,"I have hit that phase in my life where my metabolism has drastically slowed down, leaving me with 30 pounds of flesh that I don't feel deserving of.This book really convinced me on the importance of weight training in order to maintain my metabolism. I have perused a number of weight training books and this one, I feel, is one of the best. While most books go through weight training exercises utilizing equipment available only at a gym, this book uses only dumbells and a mat---perfect for an inexpensive home workout!!! I love the fact that the book presents a set workout (complete with pictures) and a diet menu for every day of the 3 weeks that your body is transformed. It also includes a weekly grocery shopping list of foods that are included in the daily menus. I definitely feel more toned and trim after 2 weeks. While I have yet to weigh myself, many people have commented that I look as though I've lost some weight. Yeah me."
3,interesting jams/interesting location,"well, the thing is this. this cd disappointed me the first time i heard it, and i'm not sure why. a huge phish fan, i had never heard this show and looked forward to the remastered version when it came out. while they certainly do experiment with several songs to interesting results (namely get back on the train and twist around), overall the atmosphere of the show is something of a let-down. granted the show was played in japan, so they obviously had to approach the audience a little differently than the typical throngs of adoring phans. on the upside, the cd obviously has magnificent sound quality and has a diverse yet representitive selection of songs. i believe this is a great live phish cd for someone who doesn't know the band too well, but already likes them. it will deepen your understanding of their depth without synaptic burnage."
3,Boring,Dont see what the big deal is about this show. Just seemingly uninspired. The Logos Jams were more like just aimless noodling.Oh well. Not a big fan of post 1998 anyhoo. Save for a few strong efforts.
3,"Better sound, poorer performance of the 5 releases","3 stars is somewhat harsh, but 5 is really for the classic recordings of all time-I feel that people throw 5 star ratings around way too liberally. But anyway, the sound on this one is wwaayyyyy better than Volume One for some reason. Much less audience, and a general ""crisper"" sound. But I must wonder just why this one got released, because there are so many better shows to let people hear. The newer Phish material is overall pretty fair, but ""Back On the Train"" and ""Twist"" have never really been known to whip fans into a frenzy. Except those fans who don't know much about Phish.If you're on a budget and can't afford all of the LivePhish releases, definitely get yourself Volumes 2 and 3. This one is best left for completists like myself who have to have every Phish release."
4,Waiting for embracing,"4 1/2Supremely tight encapsulation of the spacey period impressively displays how the group can pull classic shows not from calling out a few minor heavy hitters, but by finding relentlessly provocative j-holes to sink into from more unexpected jams."
4,Solid show,"Although this show suffers from an initial lack of focus, the band eventually hits its stride somewhere near the end of the first set. ""Back on the Train,"" with its growling guitar and rolling jam, chugs along breezily and features Mike's solid-yet-sensitive bass playing. Also contained on this release is a gorgeous rendition of ""Twist."" Using a simple rhythmic motif as its starting point, the Twist jam swells and floats its way into the sublime before returning to its original theme. The occasional missteps notwithstanding (""Walk Away""), this is an exceptional show from the transitional period between the release of Farmhouse and the band's hiatus, a period which was often characterized by lackluster performances."
5,A - Must read for Rock-N-Roll fans! You won't put it down.,"I've read a lot of books about Rock-N-Roll. This one is unique in approach resulting in seeing the industry from the other side. Not from just fans or musicians, but from behind the scenes. What really does go into each show, day after day - and somehow they come off successfully. The author has a remarkable ability to make each of Andres Augustine's episodes come to life. It really is a thrilling read. You won't be sorry."
3,Why not tell the whole truth? We're all adults,"As I read the book there were times I actually said are you kidding me, out loud! I have many friends in this business and although I won't deny that the experiences that Andre Augustine went through were like he explained, he did leave out the realistic side of the business. The chapter about the ticket swap was so laughable. The bands basically want girls with big breast and no dates up in the front, come on do you really think Gene Simmons wants to look at a guy who looks as if he spent his last dollar on a ticket or a girl with a 44DD and is there with no one but another 36/24/36. We are not that naive guys. Although the book was fast reading I think it was because I was laughing so hard and wanted to read what was next."
5,A pleasing non-tabloid look into the music of my youth,"""Guardian of the Gods"" is a must read for anyone that has the slightest interest in popular music. I was pleased to see a fan's perspective of the lives of those people who had such a huge influence on my musical tastes as an adult. The book told enough to satisfy curiosity without compomising the privacy of the musicians. The author brings to life the events and stories that we only heard about on the news, MTV, or in ""Rolling Stone."" I felt as though I was reliving my youth, even for a moment. ""Guardian of the Gods"" showed me insight into the events and people that shaped a generation."
2,Not thrilled with sturdiness of product,"While assembling this item, the tower sides that hold the top on broke. The top strap that holds the top of the cage on also split. My hamster escaped by pushing the tower tube up and knocking it off the cage. Not thrilled with the construction."
1,The Very Best of Sarah Brightman: 1990-2000,Just wasn't as good as she usually sings. I probably got one of her older CD's that wasn't as good.
1,Not a good value,"Disappointingly, this is IMITATION Almond Extract and a terrible value. The $0.65/oz price is also quite deceiving and misleading. That fact that this is an imitation product was not made clear in the description. I bought this only because I needed a filler item to reach my free shipping, but will not make that mistake again.Comparatively, [...] currently is selling top quality 100% Pure Almond Extract for only $6.69/4 oz. Lesson learned... the hard way."
3,"Suitable For Youths, Not Full Sized Adults","This ""One Size Fits All"" adult hunter safety vest is just too small for full sized adults. I am 5'10"", 200 lbs and my son is 6', 200 lbs and this vest was just too tight and ""skimpy"" to be very comfortable. The construction is also very lightweight and would only be useful for casual use in the woods as I doubt it would hold up to much abuse in heaver brush.Check outAllen Company Orange Big Man Safety Vest Chest (Blaze, upto 60-Inch)for a somewhat larger and better made vest.CFH"
3,Okay for small Adult/youth,This product is made for a small adult to youth size. If you are a women with a shirt size of more then a medium this will most likely not fit you comfortably. Product is made great for a cheap product that does what it needs to do.
5,Great help for plantar fasciitis,"I've been struggling with plantar fasciitis for several months. I read about Tuli heel cups in a magazine and decided to give them a try. I hardly feel them in my shoes, but the pain in much less since using them. I would definitely recommend them to others with foot pain."
2,Cheap heel cups,Cups are not worth the money they are soft and don't do the job advertisedvery unhappy with them and had to reorder Tuli's hard plastic cups later inanother order don't waste your money.Cups are to flimsy and to much jelly.
1,"Tuli's Classic Heel Cups,",not sure what the point of these is...but they suck! rubbed up against the back of my heel.
2,plantar fasciitis,"These may reduce heel pain a little, but they're not at all curative for plantar fasciitis. Best thing appears to be stretching the tendon on a stair step or even those night time foot attachments to pull your foot up."
1,"Works OK, NOT returnable to Amazon.com","Heal Cups are a Hit or Miss item. Either it works or it doesn't work for you. I ordered three different ones (classic, gel, heavy duty) for my son to use. He tried the regular ""classic"" ones. It seems to work ok, but he decided he did not like how it feels and stopped wearing it, claims the pain went away.I tried returning the other two unused ones, but found out they are classified as personal items, and are NOT returnable!!! Buyer beware, these are not like shoes that are returnable.3 stars for the item, minus 2 stars for Amazon return policy for this item."
1,Terrible,"Complete dissapointment, cheap quality, does not stay in shoe. I would not recommend this product even if it was free. I tried to return and could not so it went in the recycling bin."
3,Classic Heel Cups Regular,"Cups were very little help for my feet, I need better shoes. These insurts caused my toes to be more cramp in my shoes."
4,Tuli Classic Heel Cup,The item is good and it helps relief the pain on the heel. The product was worth buying and I would recommend if you are having inflammation on your heel.
1,Don't Bother,"These feel very odd, they lift your foot up so that there is little to no arch support and they don't provide any noticeable cushion. After several hours the very back of my heel hurt more than normal because all of the pressure seemed to be placed there. Save yourself money and pain, avoid this product."
2,Translationus Horrificus,I would have to recomend that you skip this installment of the Guirdjeff triology. If you have read Beelzebub or Remarkable Men then there really is no need to waste your time lumbering through what can only be described as disjointed and stuttering translation. Perhaps the worst translation ever - which is saying alot considering Penguin's long lineage of word butchery. If you must read this - learn French and read the original or skip to the last third of the Penguin version. The last third is really the only information worth reading in either language. The first 100 or so pages has Gurdjieff is a rather false humility trying to matter a factly self grandize his life and work. Not the last taste of his remarkable ideas and life that you want on your lips.
3,Dumbed down version,"The published version of Life Is Real is a limited selection from the disorganized collection of papers that was left at the time of the author's death. Some changes have been made (bizarrely - including some dates)and this version is introduced as the authorized version, although the editors were apparently coy about using their own names or credentials to authorize. Some whole chapters have been omitted."
2,"No, You Won't Find It Here","Back when the Third Series was hard to come by, people imagined --- based on rumor and hype, not the least of which from Gurdjieff himself -- that this volume would contain Gurdjieff's most significant teachings. You know, the stuff that SERIOUS and ADVANCED students of esoterica, like you, were looking for. The powerful methods that would enable you to do or be whatever it is you think you ought to do or be, other than what you already are (anything but that!) Well, keep looking, because the Third Series is pretty tame. No secrets. No mind-blowing methods. You won't be able to kill a yak at fifty paces after you read it. You'll just be back looking for that one book that will save you the trouble of self-remembering, not expressing negative emotions, etc., etc. Better to read Beelzebub's Tales that third time. Yeah, that'll do it."
4,Interesting Ambience,"I recently heard this album in its entirety. It seems to be to be more suited to be heard as sort of background music than listened to. There is little that binds each 'song' together, but Coil is sometimes labeled 'experimental' and this set has the sound of an experiment. The ANS synth itself is fascinating and can be heard on more recordings distributed by Electroshock records (i.e. Stanislav Kreitchi's ""ANSiana"" and ""Voices & Movement""). Kreitchi is one who has been using the synth for compositions since the 60's."
3,Analyze This.......,"As a student at Moody Bible Institute,I have used Merrill C Tenney's ""The Gospel of Belief,John"", as a class text book in my Gospel of John class. It has given me an exceptional background of the Gospel Of John and it's language/style Johanine. For instance, differance between the Synoptic Gospels:Matthew,Mark and Luke and its Gospel;such as John does not record the baptism of Jesus,casting out of demons,etc. Also,I was given an assignment to write an arguemant essay of five pages on the Deity of Christ. I must say that Tenney's analytic study of Christ's Deity has prepared me well by teaching me how to use the Gospel of John to point out that the seven signs are proof of Christ's Deity in action;The I am statements;the five witnesses who declared Him as The Son of God. I would recommend Tenney's book as an introductory to the Gospel of John....and also as a tool to prove Christ's Deity."
4,Very insightful,This book helped me to better understand the book of John. It gave me a deeper understanding of this Gospel.
2,daggert &ramsdell,The product did not come with any insert on product information. I t was hard to know if it could be used on the face or was it for general body.
3,same songs,"I think all childrens DVD's should not have copy protection. You must be able to copy the original and use the copy for every day use. My 2 year old goes through Barney DVD's like diapers. The average life span of Barney is 6 weeks at my house. And when it stops playing he goes crazy, like a heroin addict in withdrawl. Some thing has to be done so that Barney lives on."
1,outrageous display of horendousness,"Large dinosaur draped in purple. A mess of things, simply catastrophic. Purple first and foremost is the color of passion and royalty, this dinosaur displays neither of the forementioned. If your intention is to lower your child's intellect into the imaginary negative realm of blabbering idiocy this is a must buy. If you wish for your child to aspire to be more than a gas station attendant I recommend the more stimulating drivel displayed in the baby einstein masterpieces."
2,A noticeable falloff,"For as amazing as the first ""Livin' Proof"" release was, I expected a whole lot more. This release really disappoints if you liked the debut.And if you'd never heard the debut before, you wouldn't be impressed at all by this one.And this is probably due to one missing piece: DJ Premier. With DJ Premier producing, he could even make me sound respectable!So this album sounds very average, very non-memorable. Very generic, nothing new is added here. Overall very disappointing, but at least you can get it really cheap used!"
1,terrible album,This album sucked badly. I didn't like it at all and Melachi The Nutcracker didn't rap that much on any of the songs. It sounded like a Lil Dap solo album LOL.
4,Very entertaining...,"Filled with suspense, this movie kept me entertained until the very end. Great story, not for those who want romance or car chases."
3,Sizemore Steals It,"I think Tom Sizemore holds the pinnacle of this flick. I have seen him in other films, but he is my new favourite actor because of his performance in this movie. He embodies this man Eddie. I've seen better from Dylan McDermott, and I probably shouldn't even comment on Sharon Stone's 'acting' (you know, that character she does for e v e r y - s i n g l e - o n e of her roles . . . herself, yawn). Anyway, I was very drawn into the movie to watch more of Sizemore's acting."
1,Ink cost is huge,"I've had a Rimage 2000i for a few years now and it's been very reliable. However, the ink costs are crazy. These tiny cartridges may only last 100 DVD's in full color. Usually I get more than that, maybe 150 full color. That makes the ink over 10x the cost of the disks.These are HP cartridges (already expensive) but chipped so you can't just buy the equivalent HP, which would be cheaper.The print quality is excellent, but putting such a tiny, expensive cartridge on a robotic duplicator is insane."
5,Great twist to legal thriller,"What a great fast paced read! This is a great legal thriller that questions the message of God and Jesus. Benm who usually only defends rich clients, agrees to take a pro bono case for David who allegedly has the spirit of Jesus in him. A wonderful way to show God's message through legal terms. Highly recommend!"
4,Book Club Review,"Our Book Club choose this book for our December meeting, and we all enjoyed the book. It prompted many very thought provoking and interesting discussions. The book was not only an easy read, but an extremely interesting one.We all agreed we will look forward to the next novel by Joe. The spiritual message said something to all of us, no matter what beliefs we held."
5,I am somewhat biased as I wrote part of the jacket copy!,"I am J. M. Baird and I can be reached at jmccbbaird@aol.com I've read the book a number of times, initially reviewing the original manuscript. The first and second reads were for my enjoyment, so much to learn, so much packed in so few words. The next few reads were for style and revision, as I happened to be one of the initial editors of the manuscript, along with R. T. Ferguson. This is more than a work concerning the government and the Dr. wolf's involvement with it. This book can change lives. Especially the sale of it, as the proceeds will benefit a nonprofit foundation dedicated to children and their future. funds will be dispersed for research, support, etc. If you have any questions or comments about the book, please send e-mail to my address. Thanks for the time. I'll notify Dr. Wolf as to the manner in which to access your site. perhaps he will find the time to review the book as the writer. I hope to hear from you soon"
1,"The ""Catchers of Heaven"": An Unworthy Piece of Fiction.","Regrettably, Michael Wolf has offered no proof of who he is and what he claims. ""Catchers of Heaven"" bears no relation to the real world of ufos and ufology. After reading his work of fiction--which he acknowledges at the beginning of the book--I had an opportunity to talk to him on ""Vincent and Company"" of United Broadcast Network. On asking where he obtained his doctorate degrees he refused to answer. Wolf also had no idea of what I meant on asking him if he knew what ""Shadows"" were. (Aliens often are seen as such.) It was clear to this UFO investigator that Wolf has gleamed all he knows of UFOs and aliens from internet browsing. ""Catchers of Heaven"" is not a good read nor one I would recommend under any circumstances. John C. Thompson ISUR board member/past GA MUFON state dir."
1,"If you are serious about Aliens and UFO's, don't bother","I found this book to be self serving drivel. I threw it down in disgust after plowing through 140 pages waiting to obtain some useful insight. Instead, what I got was a way too fanciful style and content that is little more than blatent exhibitionism about how clever and wonderful is Dr. Wolf and his late family."
5,Very Interesting,"Only on Chapter 5. Reading about the excellent practices of these companies makes me want to strive for the best for my employees, also!"
1,"The ""Value"" of this book is certainly ""Hidden"" from me......","This book is merely a compilation of case studies. There are few -- if any -- check lists, tables, charts, bullet points, or step-by-step methodologies to help you implement the concepts within your own company or organization. In fact, THERE ARE ONLY 21 PAGES not dedicated exclusively to either a case study and/or an analysis of the various case studies presented within the book. Save your money and purchase ""The HR Scorecard"", ""The Talent Solution"", or ""Aligning Pay and Results"" instead. Very disappointing..."
3,"Not his best work, but fun nonetheless","Don't let the three stars fool you. This is excellent work. Mr. Foglio has not lost his humor or his artistic ability. Mr. Foglio's enjoyment of the sexual act and his pleasure in the inherent humor of it all still shines through, much to my enjoyment. My distaste for this book comes from two parts. Firstly, the sexual situation portrayed, while interesting, are mostly not especially my cup of tea (as opposed to much of _XXXenophile 1_.) Secondly, I did not find the humor particularly humorous. A good book; it simply does not have the same quality as the first."
1,"I loved it, but the love affair didn't last long","We ordered the King size with dual controls. Fantastic. My husband's side began to flash E for error 3 days later and stopped heating, wouldn't even turn on. My side worked fantastically. So we returned the blanket and ordered another one. This one lasted for 5 days until it began to malfunction, again on my husband's side. it would turn itself off during the night and would flash an error message. My side was keeping me warm until last night, when it turned itself off during the night after only 4 hours. It's not that it overheated or anything as I kept it on a moderately low level of 4. This second blanket is going back. It's a shame because it's light weight, heats up quickly and soft. Maybe you'll have better luck."
2,great while it lasts,We got the dreaded flashing E for Error message after a couple of weeks too; it's a good blanket when it works but it's plagued by poor electronics
2,broken in 4 months,"it was GREAT, the first few months. Then my husbands 1/2 of the heating control broke and while my side stayed warm, his was no longer working."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BLANKET!!,"Our first one lasted maybe a week and got the dreaded E4 error message, took it back for a replacement and the new one lasted about two weeks before getting the error message again. POOR QUALITY ELECTRONICS!!!!"
1,Two Sunbeam Heated Blanket Product Failures,"I have had problems with 2 Sunbeam heated blankets. The first lasted about 6 months; I had ""flash EE"" error signals. I'd unplug the thing, replug it, and it would work sometimes. Then it finally conked out altogether. I wrote it off and bought another. I had no ""EE"" problems, but within 8 months it stopped working altogether. I then contacted the Sunbeam service center by email, and after about 4 weeks (most of which was spent waiting for them to respond) the conclusion was, to enforce the 5 year warranty, I'd have to return it to the USA at my cost, and provide a US return address if they deemed it was repairable under warranty. I bought both products in Canada so the warranty was essentially useless. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT RECOMMENDED!!"
3,Undecided...,"Larry King is usually the background noise during dinner time in my (single) household so I pretend that I know him rather well. So when I started the book I expected the wise and experienced uncle to provide some wisdom and tell me about invaluable experiences. Well, it did not live up to that, especially in the first half of the book. But every now and again - moreso towards the end - I could hear him saying what he was writing. Much in the beginning just does not sound like him.The books offers a great overview of what moved the media during the 90ies: so, here is your entertaining history lesson - not entirely comprehensive but certainly the basics for the media small talk. He does not show off, he is honest with himself and he displays the very down-to-earth side of himself. Maybe it just lacks more wicked, unheard-of experiences that I expected to get a better rating. You got to have this ""wise uncle at 9 PM EST"" with him to like the book."
1,Disapointed,"This book reminded me of a collage term paper being done at the last minute when you increase the font size and margins to try and stretch the meager text to the length requirement. I have never been a big fan of his interview show, but I was hoping given the amount of time he has been at it, he would have some interesting ""during the break"" type of stories from his guests. It turned out that this was not the case.I would like to say that I enjoyed this book or at least found parts interesting or well written, but that would not be honest. I had to keep reading given it was the only book I had on a 9 hour flight. How can someone that has interviewed so many interesting and influential people over the years have this little to say? Thank goodness for the professional writer he hired or who knows if we would have even had complete sentences to read. Overall the book was dull, no insights and barely anything interesting."
5,incredible,"One of the best CD purchases i have ever made... Words cannot describe this album, it just seems to be true house music, deep, dark, slightly funky, mixed incredibly well with incredible track selection and sampling. The album flows flawlessly. Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed, its a 10 out of 10."
4,This would make a great textbook,"Although I was never able to finish this, it wasn't because it was a bad book; on the contrary, it's an excellent collection that would be a worthy textbook for a Russian history course. I like how the diarists were not all famous people or anything; one, for example, was just a poor middle-aged farmer. It was just that this is hardly pleasure reading and I found I couldn't commit to the whole thing, 400+ pages of small print."
4,an entertaining read,"I recently purchased this book along with a few others as my life is one bad comic standup routine, and I figured that some people would get a kick out of hearing the stories. So I bought a couple books to help me along. This book was basic in its prospective of how to write a humorous story was was a very funny and interesting read. Not sure it will help me write an award winning book, but I enjoyed reading it none the less."
4,An excellent book by an Irish patriot and hero.,"An excellent book about how the IRA was able to defeat the British millitarily, and how Sinn Fein was able to defeat the Unionists politically. Adams has long been a hero to the Irish American people, and is well known for his ability to outwit and outmaneuver the forces of Britian and Loyalisim."
1,Only for the ignorant,"Riddled with informers, running scared from Billy Wright and Johhny Adair's UVF and UFF units, militarily defeated by the British and under 24-7 observation and surveillance, the IRA threw the towel in and surrendered. Now that they have been beaten, it is important for their politicians to pretend otherwise. Only those so clueless that they barely know where Ulster is will be taken in by Adams'nonsense. An embarrassing book - avoid."
1,Flaky,"I bought this cable to use headphones with my Sony LCD since I did not like the big wireless headphones. Unfortunately since my purchase, I have had to get them replaced via Belkin RMA 3 times. As another reviewer posted, after a few days of use the right audio channel starts to cut off. If you bend the cable and apply pressure towards the female connector, it seems to work sometimes, but its very flaky. I would not recommend this cable because of this issue. Even though this cable looks very nice & solid, unfortunately it does not perform as nicely. I still have not been able to understand what causes the right audio channel to die in a few months time, especially since it keeps happening with all the cables including the replacements I have received. If someone has been able to figure this out and knows of a better solution, please let me know as well."
1,Doesn't work. Don't buy.,I love belkin products but this one is defective. Sound output was cut in half and sound lost all of it's bass.
2,So-so,"I needed a good extension cord for my headphones so after reading the good reviews this cord received, I decided to try them out.From the get-go I had to clamp the heavy metal end of the male side to keep it from sliding down and not inserting properly into the speaker jack.After that, everything went well for awhile, although the metal ends were a little heavy while moving around and extending the cord.Then the right side of the headphones would intermittently cut on and off. It was not the headphone cord itself as I tried the headphone cord by itself and moved the cord around and there was no problem so it was in the Belkin extension itself. The problem seems to be located near the female end of the Belkin extension after error correcting and maneuvering the cable around in various ways."
1,Disappointing,"I really liked Hate Eternal's first cd ""Conquering the Throne"" and ""King of All Kings"" had its moments but ""I, Monarch"" is the worst of their 3 cds. The production is terrible and there are few songs that catch my attention. Hate Eternal seem like they're regressing, hopefully Erik and Co. can pull it back together."
1,CRAP,"Hate enternal is horrible death metal band. The druming is horrible, the riffs suck, The screamers sound like there vomiting up there instines. Stay away from this (...)"
5,second only by....,"...king of all kings, which is probably the best extreme death metal album ever. and probably immolation's close to a world below. i would have to say this album is up there with those two, its that good.a must have for hate eternal fans."
5,OMFG! METALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had the pleasure of seeing them live opening up for Arch Enemy and Chimaira. This is by far one of the most blistering death metal albums deftly spun by only three guys! It just totally kills my face off! If you listen to Slipknot and think that's the heaviest thing, you gotta check out ""I, Monarch"". It should be in every metalhead's collection!"
2,Way Juvenile,"I stuck with this book, even though the shallow and silly characters made me feel like a 12-year-old.The premise isn't bad: a neighborhood of folks gets transported to a place where everybody seems to be at war with everybody else. Many of the people have latent powers, of course, and they get manipulated by the people in the new world, who are vying for control of their island. Nobody in the new world is pure ""good"", which makes things more interesting.If only the people and creatures hadn't been so darned *silly*. . . ."
5,One of the best books I ever read!!,"I liked all the characters, especially Gardner's ""Nick Blake"". He was a bit inexperienced at first, but quickly gained experience during the great conflicts of the book. At the beginning of the novel he was shy, but then later he really surprised me with his bravery. Gardner's ""Raven"" was a good supporting character that showed his true feathers by coming to the rescue in the end. A good first book of a great trilogy."
3,Doctor Who The Burning,"I ordered this on a whim when I discovered a treasure trove of books about the nearly unknown 8th Doctor. However, unlike Star Wars books there's no timeline to tell where each story begins/ends. Is there anyway anyone has a timeline for these books? I'd like to read them all in sequential order."
5,Better than ER,"Spunk, determination, and trial are a part of this young woman's experience on becoming a doctor in London at the turn of the century. A mix of intrigue, humor, and conscience spice each episode in a different way. An entertaining study in the development of women's rights and social consciencness mixed with romance. I highly recommend it. Better than ER."
5,An insiders view,"A hearty sense of the now in so many areas, things that one might never think of, on a variety of taboo subjects, laced with good humor and candid observation, a must for the well informed planet wise human. Thanks for this refreshing review of our current and not so current review of public life with behind the scenes views that are candid and inspiring revealing the inner workings of ---"
3,You get what you pay for,"It works, it's wireless, it's small & portable, and inexpensive - which is what I wanted, but it was very difficult to get back together after inserting the battery. I had to push the negative contact deeper inside so the battery wouldn't stick out too far and prevent the cover from snapping in place. There are a lot of rough edges from the cheap molding, flash everywhere...definitely not a lot of care put into the manufacturing of this little mouse. The pointing is a little jerky and not as precision as the cabled mice I have always used. It seems like it activates links just below the ones I am aiming at - very strange. It's about half the size of a regular mouse."
4,An upbeat look at post career life,"This book is an upbeat look at aspects of post-career life, of finding new interests and an informative and practical guide to leading lives that are longer and more rewarding totally based on your personal experiences. To believe that a curtain drops on life at age 60/65 leaving nothing to do but play golf makes no sense at all. Not only does that attitude fail to bring personal satisfaction it is inconsistent with recognized theories of human development. The book demonstrates practical methods for you specifically to avoid a damaging mind-set, details proven methods to adopt and nurture new attitudes, and specifically how to supplement your income based on your area of personal expertise - and new areas as well. Ways to make this a period of grace and growth rather than decline and decay."
3,It is okay for transmission,"I bought this product for my car, it seems poorly made. It does what it is supposed to, but poor transmission. Only last resort I would say. I actually returned it and got the other one the store had."
1,Does not Work,"Has 4 channels to choose from which all but one were actual stations and this transmitter will not override the station. So, had one channel to use and it was not very good reception - lots of static. Took alot of time to get it to fit right into the cigarette lighter to even work. It is inexpensive for a reason I guess."
3,it was okay,It took some time for it to work and at times there were interfering because of it's not too good transmission. It has some stations to choose from but half were active stations and couldn't hear over. Takes a lot of adjusting to work such as turning the volume up almost to max on my radio and switching from fm to fm st.For some reason it would only works on my home radio and had so much trouble hearing it in my car and found it impossible. Whenever it was working correctly it had great sound and switching songs by 1 or a couple had no trouble at all even with shuffles.I say the price is right for this device but whats the point of making this transmitter and selling it when it only half works at times and having constant flaws.
5,What Is Wrong With This Picture,"So after reading this book, wouldn't you rather have Hillary whispering into the President's ear than Nancy? There is plenty wrong with the Reagans but what is wrong with the American people for electing ""The Reagans"" to a second term of office when Ronnie was clearly in the beginning stages of dementia? I was horrified that so much happened right under our noses. A must read..."
1,The Truth,"Truth is contained in the Holy Word of God. It is sadly lacking in this material. The truth of this material is that it represents the author's attempt to use fear tactics to sell his absurd rantings. Sadly, many will be fooled by this deceiver. Don't be one of them."
1,Nonsense!,"This stuff is more properly called Irvin Baxter's individual revelation. In the gospel according to Irvin, the order of prophesies in the book of Revelation is immaterial. He argues that the sixth trumpet war is just about to break with China as the antagonist or, if not that, then India and Pakistan, or, if neither of those, then Islam versus Christianity. The problem is that the fifth trumpet has not yet sounded. Nor have the first four or, more importantly, the seven seals. Nope, Mr. Baxter has his own prophetic vision which, unfortunately, doesn't square with the Word of God."
1,Very poor.,This movie was unacceptable half way thru it it skipped continuously and we were unable to watch it...Very poor quality.
4,Good for the money,"The Butterfly Kodo is a good paddle that provides good speed, good spin, and decent control. If you are a beginner or intermediate level player then this is a good buy. However, if you are an upper-intermediate to expert level player, and if you want to take your game to the next level I would suggest looking into the pro series which offer lighter paddles. Lighter paddles offer better control but also cost more. Overall, considering the price you pay, the Butterfly Kodo is a good paddle for the casual/beginner and intermediate player."
2,Not great if you're decent or better skills,"The racket doesn't produce much spin or speed. It is good if you are just learning and need lots of control. But if you have been playing for some time, you'll need something better to improve your game."
2,Review,"This paddle is way too light, too thin and the grib is too narrow. No power. Don't recomand for anyone. Not even for beginners. Was totally disappointed. Can't believe it's from butterfly company. Going to pass it along to my kids."
2,Okay... but not worth the money,"This paddle has an alright deck, but the rubber on this racket is horrible,the rubber has a 3/10 spin rating in my opinion. There are many other itemsfrom Butterfly which are much better. Dont waist your money on this one"
3,Beowulf is an exciting epic poem of the Anglo-Saxon period.,"Despite being a very lenghty peom Beowulf appealed to me. It was an epic of Anglo-Saxon peroid which focuses on a single main character, Beowulf, who overcomes evil, Grendel. I would recommend it only to those who are into reading epic peoms."
1,Beowulf is confusing and difficult to follow.,"I had to Beowulf for school OVER THE SUMMER, so I wasn't interested in the first place, but it isn't exactly enjoyable either. It is hard to follow because sentences are broken up onto different lines, historical digressions interrupt the main plot, and the characters are difficult to relate to. There is also no feeling, so it is hard to sympathize for Beowulf and his companions. This poem was meant to be told in a middle ages court, not read on a pool deck by a 16 year old in the middle of the summer. Perhaps if I was being elaborately told the epic as well I would have liked it."
4,He ultimaetly becomes destroyed and betrayed by his friends,His friends leave him behind in the end when he is king. he is mortified that he is left behind because everyone is afriad of the dragon
1,i hate beowulf,I hated it. I tried to give it a chance but it was overblown and bombastic and horrible and I became apathetic very quickly.
4,The last & best Phish concert I ever saw...,"This show was obviously very high on many fans' wish lists and with good reason.The second set particularly smokes and was the highest energy set I've ever heard at a Phish concert.Hampton Comes Alive left some with a bitter taste about the '98 tours. Recorded only days after those sub-par shows, this entire performance shines. If its minimum spacey Phish and maximum rockin' Phish you're after, this is the best of the first six archive releases to get."
5,Phenomenal,"The most creative set I've ever seen. Wipeout throughout the set, and many rarites. Highlight of the show Weekapaug< Weekapaug reprise to a great Antelope. Must Have"
3,Reliable good SERVICE. Book is decent.,"Good and fast shipping. Good quality book. Reliable service and would buy from again. The book content itself is a little not useful and I don't think it was worth my money. I only bought it for a class textbook and it is all really common sense. It does not help you with scientific writing, it's more of a literature book about scientific writing (tells you writing style, don't be biased...). If you want a book/manual-type that helps you write an actual scientific paper/article then look for something else."
2,Waste of money.,This book is a total waste of money. You can get the same information and tips online for free.
5,Very good and to the point,"Brief, concise and to the point, that's how I would describe this book. It has tips, examples and useful advice. However, From time to time it may be too general and personally I would like more examples and details (other than the ones they have), but its enough to give you simple and useful rules so you can write and don't look like you're six years old!"
4,Traditional Screw Job,"The first reviewer below is obviously unfamiliar with the ""screwed/chopped"" style pioneered by Texas' DJ Screw (RIP). As the second reviewer noted, if you know what it is, you know what to expect, & this cd is a great example of what it is. Standout tracks include ""Things"" and ""At The Club,"" & the entire album fits really well with the slowed-down and doubled-beat process which is what ""screwed"" versions basically are. Michael Watts just did David Banner's ""Mississippi"" album, which in my opinion is much better than the ""regular"" version. This is an excellent example of hip-hop's diversity and innovation -- check it out & you'll soon be hooked on the syrup-style."
3,A note about Quinn's book with the same title...,"The book by Jane Bryant Quinn was first published in 1991. This book was published in 1995. So regardless of the relative worth of the two books, Quinn did not steal the title. If anything, it was the other way around."
1,Who's Title?,"I love the Web, but wow, is there ever a lot of misinformation around! I'm Jane Bryant Quinn, the author of the original ""Making the Most of Your Money,"" a comprehensive personal-finance guide. A reviewer on this site says I copied the title from Linder. In fact, my book's first edition came out in 1991 (well ahead of Linder), and was updated 1997. So the title was mine. I'm sure Linder didn't realize that, when he named his own book. No author likes this sort of confusion.Consumers Union says that my personal-finance guide is still the best one the market. It was judged by a group of independent financial professionals--my thanks to them all.Thanks, too, to the reader who spotted the mistake about titles on this site.I did indeed write a book called ""Everyone's Money Book."" It came out in 1978.My best regards to all. Please check out my best-selling book for yourselves! JBQ"
5,Addictive reading,"I could not understand how this book has been around for so long and I had not heard of it before. From the first page I was unable to put it down I was addicted to the plight of this mans life, whenever I had a spare minute to read another chapter I did.Annie"
5,The Physician,Great Read! So little information available on medical care at this time in history. The story was entertaining and the characters so engaging. I recommend you give this one a try
4,tye physician,"Really enjoyed this..gives an insight into the religious beliefs of the time and how the people perceived medicine and ""magic"""
4,Intriguing ancient history,"From the first page to the last, this is a fast moving tale that gives its characters depth. I highly recommend The Physician (Cole) to both history buffs and aspiring medical students, and to grandmothers like myself interested in reading worthwhile literature."
1,Tiresome,While it was interesting to learn about the customs and culture of the time in which the book is set. It became tiresome reading the same scenarios over and over again with a miraculous and frequently un believable rescue for every one. I found my self just scanning over large portions.
3,Too long and detailed for me,"I started out really intrigued with the book because I knew very little about the 11th century and also didnot realize the situation between Christians and Jews. Nor that Persia was so advamced. I think he isa wonderful writer and maybe I'm just too busy right now, but I got weary with sooooo much detail abouthalfway through the book. I forced myself to finish it but I did a lot of skimming."
3,But the ending?,"I love long, historical stories and thought this book was great right up until the end. Without giving away the plot, the ending just felt really hurried. It was almost as if the overall size of the book was looked at and the author decided to just get it over with already."
3,Good read,"Very enjoyable but especially recommended for speed readers because this is a very big book. The size bears no relationship to the complexity of the book, it is all very straightforward but extremely well researched and often very interesting. But I was not ultimately fully transported as one would hope to be by a book this large in size and scope."
4,Good book,Long and involved a bit over the top in some areas of descriptions but overall it was a good book and I enjoyed it.
5,the physician,The book is fascinating. I enjoyed every sentence. Look forward to reading the series... I will look for all the books written by Noah Gordon. I find his word crafting wonderful and easy to fllow.
5,Brilliant,This book is grim at the outset but persist. It is a great book. Yes great. The sweep of it is very broad. It is engrossing and the characters are realistic humorous engaging and interesting. Gordon must be a historian and sociologist of standing or he has great researching skills because his descriptions of Britain and Persia are very good. His understanding of the three warring great religions is deep. I am an avid historical fiction reader and I always research things presented by theses books. Many times they prove to be urban myth stuff. Often its the same regurgitated group of facts gleaned from other books of the genre. But this book had heaps of original material and I was delighted to check his facts and find a basis for them. All this in an original and large and highly entertaining book.
5,The Physician,"I enjoyed this book from the start. The Physician's long journey from his humble beginning to the end of his wanderings kept me spellbound. Well written, this book has been my favorite read of the year."
5,Enjoyed the History,"Liked the family and history aspect of Gordon's books, read all three in the trilogy. I think anyone who enjoys history and science will enjoy this book."
5,A life journey to be remembered,"This life journey was a joy to follow, the historical context was all in all correct. Cole has a keen gift for descriptive detail of the counries he sends his main character to and engages the reader into an emotional journey of one's own. A joy to read and a joy to experience."
5,What a page turner!,"Gordon delivers the life of Cole in such a riveting manner, it was impossible not to root for Cole to succeed and in the midst of all trials reach his ultimate goal. I felt that there was such a deep connection between the land of the past and the present in the story-telling."
4,Good STory,"Once into it, this book was hard to put down, as I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I came to care about Rob J. and cared about his good and bad fortunes as they happened. Fun to read."
3,Disappointing ending,"For a book this long and as detailed as it was, the ending felt terribly rushed. After becoming a doctor and leaving the middle east Rob returns to Europe and the the book seriously ends in 20-30 pages after that. Rob's quest to learn about the inner workings of the human body just falls flat. Very disappointed with the rushed ending. It kind of made me feel like reading the rest was a waste."
5,a really really passionate book,"Ok, I read this book like 2 times---with 2 years between each read. I like it better each time. It's great. You can totally feel his loneliness...maybe that is the motivation that drives him to be the physician that he's destined to be. I think that if you like adventures of different places set in times of old..then this book will be very enjoyable. Also, I like how multicultural the book is..it talks and revels in all kinds of culture, touching on gaelic with emphasis on jewish and arabic cultures...it's certainly an interesting, insightful read."
5,Entrancing middle-ages saga: the making of a physician.,"A wonderful tale set in the middle ages of a Scottish lad who discovers his mystical talent for ""reading"" the imminent death of those whose hands he holds. His thurst for the knowledge and skill to become a true physician brings him to disguise himself as a Jew in order to travel to a famous school for physicians in Arabia to learn the trade. Along the way he discovers love, friendship and trechery.Part one of what promises to be a multi-novel saga. I enjoyed every page!"
2,Don't bother,"If you love good writing and literature, skip this book. If you only care about a good story, you might like it. The guy does everything everywhere. I keep expecting him to discover the cure for polio."
5,!!!BRILLIANTLY DONE!!!,Gordon captures the 11th century with a charachter unforgetable. A must-read. Please send me information about Gordon if you can or tell me if you know a book about him or any information.
5,Absolutely superb,"This book was absolutely superb, fascinating, entertaining, and highly instructive in every way. It was a marvelous narrative story, including customs, religious beliefs, medical practices, and everyday living in the 10th-11th centuries. I would commend this book most highly and praise the author most lavishly for this work."
5,An exciting page turning historical fiction novel,"This novel captures the reader's imagination from the very fist page. I could not put it down until I was done reading it 10 hours later! The characters come alive and you you are right there with Ben in the times of the crusades and when medicine was frowned upon by clergymen. I rarely read this genre because I find it daunting, but this novel has no boring parts."
4,Good,The story was fascinating and the context amazing even if the plot was fantastical and unbelievable. The characters were well drawn and I readily related to them.
5,The Physician,Interesting subject. Great book from beginning to end. I will look forward to reading many other books by this author.
4,the physician (cole),This book has held my interest throughout the entire reading. I hated to put it down and could't wait to read it again. It takes place in a time where one could not comprehend and even back then people were learning about medicine good read
5,A great CD from a great group.,"In 1989 the only songs I heard from the Pasadenas were ""Right on"" and ""Riding on a Train"" the group never actually got that much air play on the radio here in the US, save for the now defunct ""Video Soul.""This CD is great and from a group who was stuck in a time warp they did very well and deserve alot of praise."
3,Inspired sludge,"Another rock duo of the excessively onslaughtering kind, BB should appeal to fans in the stoner-rock subgenre, offering upbeat contrast to much of its kind, but running out of creative steam to sustain a whole album, instead offering some great ideas amongst amplified repetitions."
3,Melvins ripoff,I still like this. The singer really reminds me of King Buzzo. This is totally stoner rock. A little monotanous though.
5,Talented,"There voices are calming, and their use of instruments in different musical styles is exceptional. It's not cheesy like some other Spanish Christian recordings. Almost all of the songs on this CD are also on their newer best hits album Que Tan Lejos Esta el Cielo, some as a live performance version."
2,Lense Flare,I own the older version of these so I thought this would be a safe bet to give my bird watching sister for Christmas. When she tried them out she complained of a half moon shaped flare in the lower left corner that comprised about 1/3 of the field of view. This was evident any time the binoculars were pointed within 90 degrees of the sun. My older Nikon binoculars do not exhibit this if pointed in the exact same direction. She tried two copies of these (we paid the shipping cost for both returns to B&H)and I am looking for another comparable set in a different brand.
5,Used for years,"I've used this product for years. Unfortunately, it's no longer avail at my local pet stores. I've found it works much better than many more expensive products. Not perfect, but it helps a lot!"
1,EXPERATION DATE ONE YEAR OLD,"EXPERATION DATE WAS ONE YEAR OLD.CONTACTED AMAZON,IT WOULD COST ME MORE TO RETURN IDEM.HOW COULD THEY SHIP AN IDEM ONE YEAR AFTER THE EXPERATION DATE .I WAS A STEADY CUSTOMER OF AMAZON, BUT AM VERY DISAPOINTED.WATCH THE EXPERATION DATES.THEY SHOULD OF CONTACTED ME AND REPLACE THE IDEM. OTHER SELLERS DO."
2,Made in China,"When I first starting ordering these i tought they said made in the USA ----then I saw on the pck ''China''----so I don't know if there was a change OR if I misread at some point . I have made it a policy to buy NO treat from China --esp snce reports of dog illnesses and death . I have 3 little dogs that love these but after feeding one of these my tiniest dog developed a partial intestinal obstruction anf suffered great pain ,he required major vet assistance --just short of surgery --so I have to say I cannot make a claim that these treats were the reson and my othre 2 dogs had no problem ----but with an abundance of caution I will feed no more"
4,Works for my sensitive stomach Yorkie,I have to be careful what I give my Yorkie. These treats have always worked well for us. I break them in half and just give her half at a time. Would be 5 stars but I think they're made in China which I dont love...
2,Frustrating,"Breathnach's Simple Abundance and gratitude journal changed my life. I am in a temporary apartment awaiting closing on a home in a new state when I cam across Moving On. I couldn't wait to delve in. It seems quite stream of consciousness and more self help for Sarah - if readers find it useful that may be a bonus rather than the objective. You will find pearls of wisdom. But you have to dig through Sarah's written clutter to find them, all while she hopes to motivate us to rid ourselves of home clutter.I am on pg 157 of 269 and what is helpful could be distilled down to a magazine article. However, if you wish to commiserate with disappointment and unhappiness, you will find Sarah good company, despite her success and recent marriage."
2,"Sadly, Too Cluttered for Me","I have no argument with the people who found Moving On helpful, but I could not get past the disorganization of the book, the slangy, chatty text, the quotes which were often annoyingly intrusive. At the end I wasn't sure what had been said, other than a jumble of memoir, a few practical suggestions, and a lot of theorizing about what clutter means."
5,A new classroom favorite,This is a beautiful book. The words are so wonderfully vivid and descriptive you almost don't need the pictures. The illustrations are gorgeous but I think it's the writing that is this book's greatest appeal. Both the writing and the illustrations get 5 stars.
5,PCR for beginners: A must-have !,"This book explains really good all the basics of the PCR.For the beginning PhD student, or even before, all you need to know and even more is inside. Some applications are more complicated, but the book is never too difficult to understand.A must-have!!"
5,A must read!,"A must read for all who work or live with teens - parents, teachers, youth workers! This author gets at the core of the matter - teaching all of us how to capture the heart of our teens! And he does it with authenticity and integrity! A++"
1,Badly titled book,"Book was missing the second part, April 25, 2005Reviewer: Alan Rosenthal ""Matador Wannabe"" (san diego, ca United States) - See all my reviewsHi,I have to agree completely with the previous reviewer. This book was badly named. It started out with a description of disk drives. Ok, fine, I don't mind a little review. But the review was still going on by page 100. The book only contained some brief and minor discussion of Oracle. There was one table from metalink on RAID recommendations from Oracle. There are only two chapters in the whole book that have the word ""Oracle"" in the title. One of them is on solid state disks and the other is called ""Oracle 10g Disk Related Features"" but is only about ASM.Disappointing"
1,Wrong Title,"This book has a wrong title. I thought it would provide good material about tuning oracle disk i/o performance at expert level, but actually it is an introductory book on how disks work in general. It has a cheating title. Fortunately it's not that expensive."
5,Good buy,These are a very good light. Easy to install. Very good value. great buy. I will be buying more for other rooms.
5,J-MACK! Bloody Money Bizatch!,This disk is straight from the 8 & top on dogg. J-Mack is the swizzle. Buy this now & make a ham sandwich! You can't lose on this disk.
2,Makes dog sick,"The dog likes these treats, but they make her sick. It'd be worth it to spend another 5$ to avoid all the by-products in this."
1,disappointed,Ok well i ordered this for my fixed gear bike . When i had gotten this package it wasnt even 22 balls it was 16 balls then i got a replacement for it then amazon gave me the same thing a 16 ball retainer.... i would not recommend this to any body waste of money
3,"Great for local walking tours, lacking for the longer trips.","I felt that this book would be extremely helpful to me when I read it in America. When I got to Cuzco I found that it was not giving me much more than I could have got on my own. The local trips were well documented in the day trip section. The walks from downtown Cuzco to the surrounding ruins imparticularly were quite good.The book suffered however through a lack of maps when it came to the longer journeys. Elevation markings, are extremely important in the Andes, the trips were inconceviable without them, and there are no maps in the Cuzco area that are worth mentioning. I had planned to go off on my own to do a journey the last 6 days of my month there and had to cancel it from the information being so shoddy.I believe it is a good book for local tourism with a adventurous tinge, but do not rely on his directions going farther than that unless you have, like him, lived there for a considerable amount of time."
5,Very helpful!,"I am in the process of translating a book written entirely in Norwegian and published in 1934 and this dictionary has been a lifesaver. It covers Bokml and Nynorsk and gives a brief, interesting history of the changes the language has undergone. Superb."
4,recommended!,"This dictionary is very good, the best one I've found so far, and I've been in Norway for 2 months. maybe if I try the best bookstores in big cities can find something similar, but in Norway, most dictionaries will be aiming norwegian speakers who want to learn english, so they don't come with fonetics or gender for words. the only problem with this dictionary is that it's only norwegian english, so I had to buy an english-norwegian, norwegian-english one. what i have to do when I want to learn a new word i know in english, is to look for it in the english-norwegian one and then go to my nice green one and look for gender, plural, etc. also, i'd add some fonectic symbols!"
2,Not very helpful for a beginner,"It is what it says it is, Norwegian to English. As a beginner there is no reverse English to Norwegian translation which is very frustrating."
5,Norwegian-English Dictionary,The book was very good. It is hard to find this old dictionary (the best) but this is the old hardback version.
4,review from the Synthesis,"I think I need a new brain, because mine is having a hard time wrapping itself around Where Is Black Ben?, the newest release by Need New Body. To say the album is strange is to seriously underestimate it. At first it seems like the creation of some out-of-tune junior high kids who just figured out how to make music with a computer, but by the third song you're hooked. I'm not quite sure how this happens, but the combination of strange noises, rapping and dirty lyrics creates a musical phenomenon, one that will have you dancing and bopping your head uncontrollably. An open mind is necessary for this one, but you'll be glad you tried it.- Emilie ClarkSynthesis.net"
4,Solid Historical Fiction,"Mr. Fast's relatvely short, but gripping account of the events leading to the Battle of Bunker Hill. His focus on a colonial doctor as protagonist provides an interesting and different viewpoint on the battle. The protrayal of the British Officers including Howe and Clinton made them look to be more interested in their misstresses than the war. Perhaps that was historical.The climatic battle scene is first rate. Clinton's statement to console Howe after the destruction of his grenadiers that, ""London does not count the bodies, just the victories"" was very memorable.A good read but lacks that last bit of sparkle to get a 5 star rating."
5,Patunia,"I'm not a huge country fan but I saw Wy sing one of the songs from this record on T.V. and had to have. It has to be one of the best CD's I've every owned. Some of the songs are food for the soul, some make you want to dance, every one of them is great. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,WYNONNA,"I agree 100 percent! This is the best Wynonna CD ever! She has a gorgeous voice. It is fantastic. If you don't have any of her CD's you must get this one - super, super, hats off to Wy - outstanding job!"
3,Sort of Country,"I think the album is great if you are not expecting country. If you like the Faith Hill CD you will probably like this album. There is a really good song on the album with her mother. I would suggest the Terri Clark, Pain to Kill if you want a good female country album."
3,pretty Good,I have always dug Wynonna Judd&still can't believe how slept on as a Artist She has been recieved over the past few years.Vocally She still brings the Pain.some of the Music&Songs are Hit&Miss with me but Her Voice is still One of the Best in the Entier Country&also Pop fields of Music.I still haven't heard a knock out Album all the way through yet from her but She keeps coming close.
1,FLOP!,"I predict this album will be a terrible flop. I bought this album with such high expectations, and I was really let down. I would hope that the time between albums would have been used more wisely i.e. finding the perfect songs for this album. I guess she had other things to do, because this album is plain terrible. I only like one song on the entire album. What the world needs now is for Wynonna to put out a good album again!"
4,Nice Ballads,I love Wynonna's choice of ballads on most of her albums. This one continues many of her best for both their lyrics and arrangements.
3,Box in bad condition,"Although the plate arrived in immaculate condition, the Spode box was not. The blue plate box was ripped and bent and I was embarrassed to present it as a gift to my friend."
4,Nice traveling map,The detail on this map seems to be more than adequate to do basic sightseeing of the Sicilian island. I will find out in FEB '06!
1,Very disappointed,"This people advertised the new version of the book, and when I got the book, it was and old version of the book. It was not a good one. I bought this book with this people only because they showed the picture of the new version. In the future, I'll make sure dnt buy anything from this people because they will advertise something really good, and you will get something really bad."
3,I couldn't pick flavors,"This website would not let me pick flavors, a major disappointment ! if it would have let it would have been a 5 star"
4,lip balms,i actually use this to flavor my lip balms. works really well and i can make a variety of mixed flavors without commenting to buying a big bottle.
4,Pleasing,"I wasnt expecting underground design in this book. I was looking for what I exactly found in the book: Simple graphics found in the streets, in food packaging, flyers, pamphlets... Its everything you might ""see"" in Tokyo but that you usually wouldnt pay attention to until u see it in the book.All the pictures in this book are color, in a glossy, nice paper. The overall quality of the book is really GOOD. I bought street graphics of New York too in the same order, and believe me, for the price, its a really, really good book for you all graphic-hungry-designers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A Great book for those interested in Second Temple Judaism,"I thought Collins did an excellent job at covering how Jewish eschatology came to be. He asserts that apocalypticism did not form in a vacuum, but was instead part of tradition of biblical prophetic and wisdom literature. Collins does good work also in including the apocryphal books of 1 Enoch and 2 Esdras."
1,INCORRECT INFORMATION,I recently purchased the Sports Afield: Fishing by Lee Horsley. This is how the product was clearly advertised. When I received the DVD I was surprised to learn that Lee Horsley was not at all featured on this DVD. Why did the seller advertise that the DVD featured Lee Horsley when it clearly did not!!!! I did email the Seller but to date had no response or explanation!
4,it's great,"This book is great it might not be as long as the others long meaning the length of time the book is set over for instince all of the other gossip girl books cover 2 or more months in a book but this one only covers a few weeks but never the less its still exciting. And as more novels get published we get ever closer to finding out who gossip girl is. i don't know about the rest of you GG fans out there but i can't wait for the GG movie there basing on the first novel and it's starring Linsay Lohan i wonder who sees going to be. I've got a theory that shes going to be blair, as Serenas gone blondy white hair wot do u think? See you soon you know you love her. JG"
5,i love it like that,I love all the gossip girl novels:) each time i get a new one i reread the whole series. I would recommend this 2 all teen girls who like gossip & romance with attitude.i can't wait to find out what happens next.P.S. In the book Dan bores me:(
4,A Great Teen Novel!,"I recently finished this book and I loved it! Although there were a few editing mistakes. However, I just couldn't put this book down. I love the Gossip Girl books and can't wait for the next one to come out!"
3,MEH is the word im looking for,"Just like everyone else who has read this series..I am in love w/ Gossip Girl and cannot put down each book until im done w/ it. however, I Like it Like That was really just okay...it was very meh...it was just there. Im getting a tad bit annoyed w/ the fact that Blair and Nate wont just get back together and B can lose it already. its just like friggin Ross and Rachael!! so ya...im pretty sure it will happen in the next one..unless the next one was like this one and is a friggin vegetable w/ no exciting action going on. i miss aaron too....he was the one i was rooting for after the 3rd book, but he was virtually gone from #5 :( so ya cant wait to find out if B gets into yale, if nate gets a life and gets w/ B, if vanessa, dan, and jenny will ever get exciting, and who the (...) gossip girl really is. read it but dont buy it...kind of a waste if u do...u*no*u*luv*me"
1,i dont like it like that...,"After seeing quite quite a few reviews and a woman clearly over thirty buying this book, i decided to give it a go. The book revolves around a few disgustinly stuck up socialites. It's all about wearing designer clothes, partying, and of course-getting adorable rich boys. Gossip girl seems to be filled with things people gossip about. Silly things. Stupid things. And for lack of better words, this is a horrible book."
4,i like it like that,I have to say this is the best one yet! Sure it could have had a little more spice and romance but i think were in for a real treat next book. Can't wait to find out who you are!
3,GG#5,"""I Like It Like That."" Not. The 5th GG book was a little disappointing. It wasn't as juicy and exciting as the first four. But, nevertheless, I love Cecily von Ziegesar. I loooove Gossip Girl. And I still have not a clue who Gossip Girl is! I can't wait for the next one."
4,Good,THis is book was good but not great. This book is one of those books that are to put down. THis book has some strong language and other adult material that some parents woudnt want their children to read....other than that i loved it.
2,Sad but true,I have all the Plasmatics albums and many of the EPs. They are my favorite band of all time. The Plasmatics were by far the most outrageous band of the last century and Wendy was one in a million. All the Plasmatics albums rock except this one. I am glad I have the Maggots CD just to add it to my collection but I never listen to it. I will admit some hardcore metal fans might like it. It is better than Twisted Sister and Poison but it is no Metal Priestess.
5,Glad to own it!,I have not had this recording since I was 12!I am happy to own a copy again!Just as creepy as I remember it being! :P
3,Wendy O. Williams-'Maggots:The Record'(Plasmatics Media),"Believe this lp to have been the last ever 'actual' effort to be put out by Wendy O. and her demented henchmen.'Maggots...' appear to be a concept album.What,a concept album,the Plasmatics?An okay disc,but there's a Rod Sterling-like narration all through the CD that features too much dialogue(for the disc's running time of 35 minutes,that is).Tracks I liked best were ""The White's Apartment"",""You're A Zombie"",""Propagators"" and ""Brain Dead""(with the lyrics,""WE ARE BRAIN DEAD,WE MARCH WITHOUT A HEAD!"").Sort of tough to take this record seriously.Liked the story line where the Earth is being taken over by giant maggots that are increasing in size as the hours go by.Line-up:Wendy O.(R.I.P.)-vocals,whip cream&sledge hammers,Wes Beech-guitar,Michael Ray-rhythm guitar,Chris Romanelli-bass and Ray Callahan-drums.Check it out."
4,The narration is a bit much,"I absolutely adore Wendy O Wiliams and I am a hardcore Plasmatics fan but I kinda wish that the narration had been placed in one whole chunk at the end of the disc instead of between the somgs. The music is great! Intense and fast! Wendy's vocals are vocal chord shredding (almost literally) and perhaps the best of her career. The recording tends to be a bit muddy,but I guess I've heard worse."
4,Should have been the soundtrack to an Evil Dead movie,"Wendy is missed terribly. 80's rockers will always remember her for her outrageous albums, insane concert performances (chainsawing a guitar, blowing up a car, getting naughty with a microphone) and as Charlie in her flick 'Reform School Girls'.This album sounds like it was thought out, recorded, and mixed all in one weekend in a garage. The whole album is so spontanious, that you would swear not even the band had a clue as to how it would turn out. Let's face it music like this just isn't made anymore. This set of tunes is fun, loud, and can't be taken seriously. Unlike today's mainstream garbage that MTV is shoving down the throats of America's Youth.I say long live the days of 80's hair, Headbanger's Ball, and horror flicks. Wendy will always have a place in our hearts for those who lived through those days. Wendy scared the hell out of all our girlfriends."
1,Barney's Halloween Party,Very interesting to my 2 yr old grandaughter. Excellant for the upcoming holiday.
1,Developed a hole after 3rd use,"I've been a big fan of Smartwool products in the past, but this pair of socks for my girlfriend developed a hole in the side after having been worn only 3 times. Perhaps they were defective, because my other Smartwool socks have held up reasonably well, but buyer beware."
4,DEFINITELY A GOOD BUY!,"I was a little leary about buying Michelle Flowers' CD in the beggining but within the first few minutes of listening I was captivated! Her voice is very relaxing over smooth pumping beats and soothing chords. Then she turns up the ""holy heat"" with songs like ""The Highest Praise"" and belts out sheer power. With very original lyric's and great mix of contemporay R&B/HIP-HOP and traditional Gospel sound. This should definitely be in your CD collection. I hope to hear more from this new artist."
4,"The Future, 70s style","A collection of sci-fi themed paintings by Peter Elson and Chris Moore, 'Parallel Lines' presents a stylised, 70s view of the future, as expressed through sci-fi book covers. Although neither Elson nor Moore are as famous in their field as Chris Foss and Syd Mead, they have distinctive styles - Elson piles on layer after layer of detail, with giant starships falling into tiny pieces, and Moore goes for spooky atmosphere, abandonded space-stations and broken wreckage. Neither artist is content to paint space as a black void, either, and vivid colours abound.Their work is also compiled in the 'Great Space Battles' books, and 'Spacewreck' (or 'Starwreck'), both of which appear to be long out-of-print and rare."
5,A spooky and lovely film,"Egoyan's best, by far. This film is pure voodoo; a dark, luscious, unpredicatble, sexy, intelligent, mesmerizing, twisted, touching, methodically paced piece of art. One of my very favorite films, and it gets better with multiple viewings. The soundtrack is haunting and amazing, too."
2,"Dumb movie, weird plot",A very dumb movie with a very weird plot. Didn't find any redeeming features in it. Forget about it now.
2,Waste of time,"I watched this on the Independent Film Channel, drawn in by the premise of the story, only to be really disappointed. Several ridiculous plot lines converge at the strip club Exotica, and the only memorable moments in the film happen here, and I don't say that because of the strippers. The sound through most of the movie is awful, very hushed, forcing you to turn the volume up so loud that when the boom mike actually does pick up some of the characters' lines, you're sure to go deaf. Instead of coming across as an artsy film, it comes across as a jumbled mix of images and mumbled lines. The only reason I gave this thing 2 stars was because of Elias Koteas, who plays the DJ and jealous boyfriend. If it weren't for his excellent job of being a believeable creep, one star would've been all I'd given this. Skip this one."
2,Laughably Silly - Watch it as a Comedy,"Body Double was silly, but at least it delivered on some visceral thrills. This movie is one of the most wildly overrated films I've seen. Despite the implied advertising, there is not a single sexy scene in the entire movie. All of the characters are laughably moronic, filled with self-pity and timid perversity. The plot plods along in a coy, self-important way that may drive your thumb to crush the fast forward button. The ending purports to resolve a great mystery, but it delivers only a whimpering anti-climax. If you're looking for a sexy drama, try Dangerous Liaisons, or even Hot Spot or Swann in Love."
1,Don't waste your time with this trash,"I was browsing movies on Amazon looking for something new and different to watch, using customer reviews to decide if it might be worth my time or not. When the movie started, I already knew this one was a mistake. I sat through the whole thing (another mistake) and in the end I felt very cheated out of a buck and a couple hours of my life I could of spent doing something else.The acting, characters, script, and plot were pathetic. The climatic ending that people keep mentioning wasn't a big deal at all. This movie was not artistic as some claim. It wasn't thrilling or suspenseful. It was just a bad attempt at a bad story with bad actors. Move right along to the next movie."
2,Doesn't play on UK DVD player,"I know this is an interesting film because I saw it when it first released, however unfortunately it will not play on my UK DVD system."
3,I almost didn't watch it,"Like others who've written here, I rented it - drawn in by the intriguing review - but the cover made me think I was getting less than I had hoped for.It started off well enough that I realized there was something real here - more than a thin plot to show off some beautiful women.I've watched it twice now, hoping that w/ the insight from the first viewing I'd have a better understanding of the ending - unfortunately it's so cryptic I still don't understand it.The shots are beautiful, women are truly erotic, and it's interesting in a strange way. As much as I enjoy a good twisting and original plot, I unfortunately just didn't get this picture."
5,your perceptions totally shattered,"If you Love having your mind challenged this is for you. Seductive Imagery (forget the box Cover) and complex characters lead you to certain beliefs only to have your perceptions totally shattered. Gorgeous visuals and spell binding story lines. Opening Sequences in the the film seem to be about randomly selected strangers. By the end all that you once believed is untrue and a clarity of how these people are so tightly wound up together that if you took one away, their world would collapse."
3,Very entertaining,"I think that if you dig deep enough in this film, there's nothing there. The story is contrived and goes out of its way to set you up. But the ride is a lot of fun, from the titilating setting to the engrossing soundtrack, you're fairly absorbed throughout the movie. You sit there forming opinions about what you're seeing, trying to figure out why the filmmaker has brought you here, and then the final twist when all the pieces you've seen come together, nothing is as it seems -- but still none of it makes too much sense. Despite the deep, dark secret that underlies the story, you have a hard time seeing how everyone got from point A to point B in this story. It's a setup, a manipulation. But it still really is a lot of fun."
1,This Is A Morass.,"Simply put, don't waste your time. Is there a mystery hidden in this morass? Who cares? Artsy-smartsy, pretentious meanderings through the oh-so-dark lives of vague, uninteresting characters who all brood way too much."
1,Lame and Boring movie,I recently saw this movie on cable and must say that it was the most boring movie I've ever seen. The characters all act like philosophers by that everything they say is analytical coupled with music. The speed at which they talk is horrendously slow. About 60 percent of the movie is music and facial expressions and 40 percent is dialogue. It has the feel of Lolita but don't confuse it with that fine film. The stripper in this movie is decent but not that great. She doesn't say much but then again that can be said of all characters. .....
1,Terrible,"It would hard to make a film this bad if you tried--and I mean that. The acting, writing, the cinematography are execrable, horrendous. This was an appallingly bad film, so bad that when I saw it in the theater--even though I thought the lead actress was quite beautiful to look at--I walked out. How it ever got a distributer, much less financing, I'll never fathom."
3,Canadian Bacon,"Mia Kirshner will haunt your dreams in a good way. This is her pre-'L Word'. So sweet coquettish + innocent, yet possesing Carnal Knowledge simultaneously; not easy to pull off."
1,time consuming,"too many questions. too much work. and the questions are kinda repeating, notmuch help. It takes my son forever to finish ten pages."
5,successfully understanding the foundations of algebra,"Having faced the challenges of learning algebra in college, I found this book online and bought it -and the workbook- as a supplement to my course assigned textbook. I was really impressed at how easy I could comprehend the intended subject matter as I had struggled with it on previous occasions. I really liked the format of the book and how the examples were lain out. I recommend it to anyone learning this subject :)"
3,Unusual ballet - Totally Maks Ek; Add a star if you adore Baryshnikov,"I lean toward the traditional classical ballet and bought this because I wanted see anything more recent that showcased ""Misha.""If you're familiar with Mats Ek's work, you know his ideas are, um, unconventional. I won't even pretend to figure out what the story was about, but it was fun to see Baryshnikov in a setting that was completely outside his genre.It's not as much fun as his works with Twyla Tharp. At least those works make sense.I would say, if you can get it from a library first, you'll make a better decision as to whether it's a piece you want to own."
4,It's very insightful,"I am in second-year Spanish in my high school and this is the textbook we are using. I found it to be pretty helpful and gave me a better knowledge of the cultures we were studying. It is kind of difficult to understand, however, because all the directions were in Spanish, not english. But it's a pretty helpful book if you've already had some Spanish lessons."
1,Bought The Wedding Date (movie),"Greetings!Whenever I feel so strongly about the songs in a movie I'll buy the soundtrack or both. In this case I bought the movie in order to have the songs. I do wish one could buy the songs played in the movie, for they are quite pleasing to the ear!"
3,Not what you think,"We loved the movie, expecially the music. We thought the soundtrack would include ALL the music from the movie but it didn't. We were mildly disappointed."
5,Vendor sent item very quickly...perfect,"Vendor did a great job, sent an email mentioned i needed the item very quickly and received it within a few days!!!"
5,Just what I wanted,I looked everywhere for this soundtrack for my mom for Christmas. I was about to give up when I found it listed here. It shipped on the expected date and it was in perfect condition!
5,A Must have Soundtrack.,This is Definately a must have Soundtrack!!! The music is absolutely Beautiful. A great Buy at any price.
2,Unfortunetly this is the orchestrated soundtrack,"the previous review is of the movie not this soundtrack, and yes the wedding date ia a great movie... so that is why we are all looking for a copy of the songs featured in the movie, that helped make the movie so good! but alas they don't seem to have a CD, that I could find with the song featured in the movie. Hopefully they will! The songs we all are looking for and want in the soundtrack would be:The Corrs - BreathlessTexas - When We Are TogetherThe Chiffons - One Fine DayKC and the Sunshine Band - Boogie ShoesJames Brown - I Got The FeelingAir Supply - All Out Of LoveMaroon 5 - SecretMichael Buble - SwayJoss Stone - Super Duper LoveMichael Buble - HomeMichael Buble - Save The Last Dance For Me"
1,Very Disappointed,I wanted this soundtrack for a Christmas gift for my daughter. Imagine the surprise when she opened it and then the disapointment when she first played what she thought was the great songs in the movie.Thanks to the one who wrote in all the songs that were in the movie. Now I can find them elsewhere and make her a collection.
1,Buyer Beware! Everything is not as it Appears!,"the cd was misleading as I thought it was music from the movie. It should have been listed as a ""score"" not a soundtrak. This is an awesome music with really great songs and having a cd of these songs was what I was looking for. It appears to be a soundtrak, looks like a soundtrak, but really be careful! It is not what you think. I opened it without thinking and the buyer would not take it back, even though the wrap looks like an after market wrap. If you love the movie and think you are getting the songs from the movie, then STOP and read. This does not have 1 single song from the movie.Sadly I am disappointed!"
1,Not the best choice for the soundtrack,"I was really upset that this soundtrack was nothing more than muscial sets of background music. The movie had more than background music, it had songs, songs that made the movie so sensual and exciting. Songs that made me feel like these things were happening to me. Why in the world would you omit such a large part of the music content from this soundtrack unless you were just too cheap to pay the extra royalties involved. I feel jipped and very disappointed in this soundtrack production. Come on guys get with the program or jump ship altogether and let the real soundtrack pro's show you how it's supposed to be done! There, I've said exactly what many of you have only been thinking and I feel better for it. I'm still ripped off of 20.00 for a soundtrack that sucks but I've said my piece."
3,In reply,"To the person who asked what the name of the song in the credits was...it is ""Home"" by Michael Buble. I went out and bought his CD because I liked that song so much from the movie. I'd never heard it before then. I, too, am pretty disappointed that there is no soundtrack (non-orchestra) out there!"
1,Soundtrack???,"Finally, a movie where I loved every single song in it. What a great CD that would make!!! Oh no, none of the great songs I heard. I'd rather pop in my sons Star Wars soundtrack if I wanted to listen to an orchestra."
3,The REAL Wedding Date CD,"Anyone care to tell me which order you would put them in:Can't Get You Out Of My Head (Kylie Minogue)Breathless (The Corr's)I got the Feelin' (James Brown)Home (Michael Buble)Save The Last Dance (Michael Buble)Sway (Michael Buble)One Fine Day (The Chiffon's)Boogie Shoes (KC and the Sunshine Band)Secret (Maroon 5)All Out Of Love (Air Supply)Super Duper Love (Joss Stone)When We Are Together (Texas)If anyone thinks I'm missing any of them PLEASE let me know, otherwise I'll burn it this way. I have to pay for each song (.79) but hey it's worth it for all the great songs this Movie Has :)I am going to burn this CD if anyone wants one contact me for details.Tammy"
2,Dismayed and Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received this CD. I was hoping to get all the great songs that had been in the movie. Instead I received a CD of the orchestration. Although these songs are well written and pretty, they are not what I had expected."
3,Loved the movie...,"LOVED the movie, so the musical CD was a surprise. I wonder why they only had the score and not any of the music by the wonderful artists? Anyway, the song that Kat and Nick danced to was ""Sway"" by Michael Buble. If you have iTunes, it's only on the Las Vegas Soundtrack and you have to buy the entire album. sheesh... If anyone else knows where to just get the single, that would be great! Mahalo!!!"
4,Super-economy thriller that delivers,"The hard, slashing night rain in Plunder Road's first five minutes all but obscures our view of the lynchpin of the plot: the hijacking of a train for its cargo of gold bullion. The remainder of the film follows the hijackers along their various escape routes. (There are foreshadowing's of Goldfinger's Rolls Royce -- or echoes of Judy Holliday's Solid Gold Cadillac -- in the plot). Its no-frills narrative, poverty-row cast and spare economy of means make Plunder Road a surprisingly effective example of late noir."
4,This film needs to come to dvd,"Great caper flick is many good things . Sophisticated robbery shows ALL aspects of an ingenious heist . Refreshingly , the police are depicted as the intelligent people they were and are (1957) . This film is smart and quite realistic in the way it portrays an array of humanity , both good and flawed . While i did not recognize any actor or actress (save Elisha Cook) , the acting is pretty darn good . Solid script . If you like older film and are a TCM person , please write your take . Lets see if we can get this honey on dvd ."
5,Funny!,"When sam eats a black pudding in his rice. He started eating things like rats, sponge, worms even glue. Somebody has to stop Sam from eating everything in Fear Street."
5,Eat and eat,I personally liked the book. Sam Kinny starts eating everything in sight after he eats something from his friend's aunt.
1,This was horrible!!!!!!,"I love the goosebumps series and I love almost all of R.L. Stines books but this book was absolutely horrible. This book wasn't even scary it was just plain stupid. This book started out really slow and I was just waiting for something scary to happen but when something did actually happen it was so stupid.This book was about a boy who meets his friends aunt sylvie and aunt sylvie is into ghosts and weird things. One day aunt sylvie puts some weird black specks in his pudding.He then starts craving weird things like dirt and worms.This book also had the worst ending to, it was very dumb.Don't waste your money on this book because you will probably be very dissapointed with it."
1,yuck!!,no means this book could have been written by R.L.Stine. R.L stine is my favourite author and i was truly disappointed by reading this book.it started from no where and ended up no where. i could not even give half star for such a book.
2,ANOTHER BORING BOOK,"I had even reviewed ""The Ooze"" and this too was boring. There was no plot nothing. The end was SOOOOOOOOOO dumb. There was not a single moment when I was not bored. If you have insomnia then read this book. Your insomnia will be cured instantly. It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring. Zzzzzzz,Zzzzzzz....."
4,A valuable and beautifully illustrated resource!,"For anyone who admires or collects Hopi jewelry, this guide will only serve to deepen your appreciation of this beautiful artwork. After setting the stage geographically, Wright starts at the beginning with a history of Hopi crafts and culture, and early silversmiths. Of particular interest was the role played by Mary-Russell Colter of the Museum of Northern Arizona in encouraging the Hopi artists to create a design style that was uniquely Hopi, distinguishable from other Native American jewelry, and therefore profitable. The color plates of traditional and modern Hopi jewelry designs are stunning. The book closes with an index of the hallmarks of more than 300 Hopi silversmiths-- arranged chronologically and by type of symbol, with brief information about each artist. An invaluable reference for serious or casual collectors!"
3,Helpful but not quite,"There was a review that suggested purchasing the book along with Hallmarks of the Southwest written by her husband. I did this. There are a lot of Hopi Hallmarks in this book, that are missed in the other. The way they are laid out is the problem. There is not an understandable order at first glance. It was helpful to find a name, but there was little information about the names. Had to use her husbands book for that. The history of how things got started is a good read."
4,Excellent Information on Hopi Silver,"Southwest Native American Jewelry is often seen as ""monolithic"": ""Oh I got it in the Southwest, when I was visiting there."" This book, and the photographs offer some clear differences between styles of the Hopi, the Navaho, and the other pueblo tribes in New Mexico."
1,Peru is not berkeley,"I was very disappointed by this book. I'm from Peru and I expected a sharp, original account. Instead, I learned lots about the author and her struggles with my country. I understand her frustrations but in the end I felt that she simply realized that Peru is not Berkeley or Manhattan. It's too bad she didn't capture good things such as people's resourcefulness or sense of humor. I also got lost between different sections. Too bad. I know that many gringos will enjoy this. Peruvians will dislike it, even those who fight against violence and inequality."
3,Good for a reader who does not know much about Peru,"It is a good, interesting book. She portrays different aspects of the Peruvian reality for the reader who is not very familiar with Peru. However, for a Peruvian or someone who had lived in Peru for a while, the book will be only scratching the surface of the Peruvian reality."
3,French for holiday makers,Very good for correct pronnouciation for basic level 'vacation french' but not super useful for those speaking at a higher level.
1,Save Your Money!,"Disappointing, to say the least! Within the first couple of pages, I found mis-transcribed words, e.g. for ""comment"", this book represents both syllables as having the same vowel sound. This is incorrect!Also, the transcription ""ou"" is used for the vowel sound of ""peu"", ""deux"", etc. To me ""ou"" is sounded as in ""you"" or perhaps as in ""flour"" - neither of these have anything to do with the French vowel sound of ""peu"" or ""deux""!If you want to learn good French pronunction, get a CD that has a native speaker on it - there are many to choose from. But run a mile from this book!"
4,Each book is one tale,"Just to clarify - each 16 page book is *one* story, although there are 28 stories in the series. The words are in big clear type, nice for early readers. This is the Ugly Duckling (in case you are, like me, an English speaker, buying a gift)."
3,A primer on the science behind art,"First and foremost a science textbook, Light and Color in Nature and Art covers the mathmatics and chemistry behind different lighting phenomena and how they are captured on film or canvas versus seen by the human eye.While artists may be tempted to pick up the book for a deeper understanding of color theory or the science of film emulsion, the book is highly technical and does not really lend itself toward artistic development. Definitely not a necessary addition to the artists' bookshelf, but a worthy textbook for those interested in physics."
4,Very good,"Nice music, very good text in a book, explaining what you hear and also gives you some details about the author and music instruments. I just do not like very much the illustrations style, but this is very personal."
2,good but confusing,"I think it is a lovely book, and the cd is wonderful, but completely confusing. The track numbers are off, and maybe worse than I know... There are 15 pieces for the Carnival, not 14 like it's listed in the book.... and the rest of the songs aren't even mentioned in the book, so I have no idea what they are. There is NO reason that this book should still be being published with those kinds of errors."
4,Good introduction to classical music,"I got this book for my 4yo, who is actually more interested in classical composers, but we could not find a book about Saint-Saens. So I was glad to see that this book provides some biographical information, to the extent that it is relevant to this particular composition.My daughter had already been exposed to some explanation of the meaning of the different pieces, so I was glad to see that this book contained a lot of detail to help her learn more about it. And since she is just barely learning to read, the large, colorful illustrations helped her follow along by herself."
2,CARNIVAL OF THE ANIMALS BOOK,"The book was excellent, however the CD was not included with the book, so was disappointed I did not receive it after writing to seller."
2,Didn't really work,"it didn't really work for me, tried it for my chinchilla and they just licked it off the things i sprayed it on"
3,Puppy use,"To be fair, the product states it is intended to be used on ""small furry animals""- bunnies, Guinea Pigs, etc. My sister recommended it to me when I brought a new puppy into my home- a puppy that likes to chew. Anything. Unfortunately, this spray did not deter her. Well, it did slow her down a wee bit- she had to lick the spray off first."
4,Good purchase,"Good purchase; item received in good condition, as expressed by seller.Will do business with again."
1,Help Your Kids Get it Done Right at Home and School!,"This book was so poorly written, if I had looked through it in a book store I would not have purchased it. The 109 pages could have been put into 5 containing the basic facts. Horrible book, she should be embarrassed for writing it, I am for actually owning it."
2,craftmanship not as expected,The rack worked well. Machining for the custom fit saab mount was off on two of the four mounts. I had to drill out the holes to fit properly.
1,Terrible craft book,"This book is almost laughably bad. One of the art projects is ""make a bookshelf from cardboard boxes"". As you can probably guess it involves turning a box on it's side and decorating with markers or what not. I would say there are five crafts in the whole book that I would actually make. You would be better off printing some craft projects off online, or getting inventive."
1,Not worth a dime.,"If these crafts were loved by these readers then when they found really great crafts they would go crazy! These crafts are extremely generic, not at all creative, and laughable to be printed and bought in my opinion. I definately wasted my money on this one and am disappointed. I was hoping I could find some nice crafts for my toddler but I wouldnt' care to give this book away as a gift even. I'm hoping the art books I also ordered wind up being a million times better."
3,THE LITTLE HANDS BIG FUN,El libro tiene mucho que aportar aunque nos toma un poco de tiempo traducir las actividades por el idioma.
3,convenient,"rather than travel to japan or the south seas, why not buy your pearls here? completely as described, black-green color was strong and size matching was good. I candled a few pearls, and the pearlescent layer was pretty good over the core.still...buying pearls online is....Not everyone is going to have the same experience."
4,Great tips and photos,"The book's strong points are the photos and some of the practical tips and ideas. It's not an easy read so I don't see myself reading it again, but I will flip through it from time to time to get ideas from the pictures."
3,Some helpful ideas!,I think the book is worthwhile...even if just for the photos...in the case of those that have some concept of how to put things together or make those photos come to life. I was inspired by several pictures that I plan to implement. However there may be those who find the book is lacking in detail as to how to create some of the purposed ideas...so in that respect it may be frustrating. The book doesn't focus enough in my opinion on small spaces...as much as it does on being more organized & utilizing creative organizational methods to enhance a space. It appears that some of the rooms could be categorized as medium to large in some cases...so I deducted points for BH&G for not sticking to the main so called objective of the book. Overall I'd recommend the book though...however try finding it on sale to ease your conscience.
4,"Warning, Libretto not in English","Despite the Description in the Amazon listing, the text of the opera is in Czech and German, not in English."
1,Betty Boop Seat Covers,I was hoping for better quality. They don't fit well and the material isn't of very good quality.
2,Generic,"With a title like ""Symphonic Impressions of Oman,"" I was expecting to hear some Middle Eastern sounds mixed into symphony orchestra renderings. Instead, it just sounds like generic symphony orchestra music, like any 19th century orchestral work. It's okay as far as that goes, but if you're looking for Middle Eastern flavors, I suggest Claude Chalhoub's album instead. It's not full symphony, but at least it's instrumental violin-led tracks that do have a Middle Eastern flavor."
2,Not impressive,"I thought this CD would have some Omani traditional music blended in symphonic music, it was not. Neither ""impressions"" of Oman were in this CD nor middleeastern music for that matter. So do not be decieved by the titile, this is a UK orchestra with no Omani or arabic tone to it."
3,A bobby soxer Christmas,"This is a collection of Christmas songs by Young Blue Eyes, by his first record label, Columbia. Sinatra certainly had a good voice, but he hadn't quite developed the great phrasing that he later became famous for. Also, the arrangements of the songs aren't really all that interesting. For some reason, a lot of the songs are alternate takes, instead of the master takes. There is also a ""V-Disc"" and three songs performed live on the radio. This is a decent enough collection, but Sinatra's later Christmas recordings are better."
3,We're oooof to outer spaaaace...again!,"Spinning off from Star Blazers, Galaxy Express 999, and Captain Harlock, this 13-episode series is set in what's called the ""Lejiverse"". Leji Matsumoto, who created Queen Emeraldas and Maetel Legend, did this showing what went on with the Earth forces after their war with the Machine Men, as shown in the Galaxy Express 999 movies. Earth has signed a peacy treaty with the Machine Men and is working together with them. But renegade pirate Captain Harlock(also known as Herlock)relentlessly keeps attacking the Machine Men cargo ships. So Earth sends a reformed battleship made of both humans and machines to stop him once and for all. Lead by Captain Zero, this crew tries to get along despite their differences. Zero gathers more allies along the way, and runs into various resident characters like the piano-teethed samurai/engineer Tochiro. Cosmo Warrior Zero is a decent sci-fi series, but mainly for old school anime fans."
2,not what I expected,"I was in hopes that this would be worth while watching, but it's pretty bad all around.Bad acting.(English/Japanese versions.)Bad animation which reminds me of crappy U.S. cartoons.(no offense intended to Bugs show and friends here)I bought it because I am a captain Harlock fan. But, he was portrayed very badly."
1,Anti-Beatle,"This film has no involvement, musically or otherwise from the Beatles, except for archival newsreel footage. The idea is that its director will turn ex reporter Ruth Anson's idea to re-connect with Paul McCartney after he made a facetious marriage proposal to her during an interview decades ago into a joke on Anson's age, desperation and ""out of it-ness"". Supposedly Anson is in on the joke but it seems more like she was too deeply invested in the project and too fearful of not seeming like a good sport to withdraw when it took that change in direction. The positive reviews on this site must have come from people involved in the project. The film is tedious and boring. It is never ever funny and it is despicably mean. To try to ameliorate its cruelty by claiming it to be a mockumentary is a futile and transparent gesture. There is absolutely nothing here for fans of the Beatles, music or film. A complete and utterly vile undertaking that should never have seen the light of day."
5,Clever Mockumentary,"Desperately Seeking Paul McCartney is a clever mockumentary that appears to be making fun of itself, reality television, and the dreams that most of us harbor. DSPM isn't really supposed to be about Paul McCartney; he's just the catalyst. Come on; did you really think that they would get to Sir Paul? It's showing how a reality show can make a huge deal out of, well not so much, but once the project gets going, it must as they say remain married to the idea that ""the show must go on.""Here's a review of the movie from someone who seems to understand what it is really about:[...]And the music can be heard here:[...]"
5,Same Stuff as Stars,"I thoroughly enjoyed Katherine Paterson's book Same Stuff as Stars because it is an excellent example of realistic fiction. The themes that are present in this book are common to many children in today's society. Imagine being motherless and fatherless and having to rely mainly on yourself for support. Angel is eleven years old in this story and is trying to take care of her younger brother. She is desperate for a real home, unlike her current situation of living with her poor-grandmother. A stranger who is able to explain the night skies is truly all she has to make a difference in her life. Will this stranger's wisdom be enough to eliminate her loneliness and overcome her tragic circumstances she faces each day?"
4,Angel's Life,"Has your dad ever been in jail? Angel's dad has. Angel is a girl that is about eleven. She lives with her mom, Verna, and her brother Bernie. She doesn't have a normal family though. Her mom is trying to get by in life and her brother is not helping. Her mom is tired of waiting for their dad to get out of jail. One day, they packed their bags and moved to their grandma's house. This grandm isn't like every loving grandma. She doesn't give them very much food and doesn't do what every grandma does. For instant she doesn't tuck them in and read to them. Angel finds a mystery man in her grandma's backyard. Will he help her or cause more problems? Read the book The Same Stuff as Stars by Katherine Paterson and find out. What will Angel do? What will her family do? There are many things to come."
5,Why do we act the way we do?,"Why do we act the way we do? Is it because we are the same stuff as the stars and are as stable yet unstable as they are? Paterson has again written a book about forgiveness and acceptance, which to me is the theme of many of her books. I was hooked on this book early on and reminded a little of Bridge to Terabithia (a favorite) as well as The Great Gilly Hopkins. Paterson's story may help readers understand life. For folks (old and young) who wonder if life is worth living, this book should help them figure it out. It's a great ""read by one-self"" or ""read-to-others"" book. The characters are very real and the situation quite plausible. The trio of books (Gilly, Terabithia, and Stars) would make a fabulous author or theme study."
1,my tirade on cover art,"OK, you would think that Katherine Paterson is famous enough to get decent cover art on her books. Haven't read this one yet--sounds intriguing, but the cover art is so pathetic I'm not sure I want to pick it up! What is wrong with publishers? Can't they tell that this cover art is just horrid?"
4,An Interesting Book,"Zanshin is an interesting little book. It is a little unfocused on its overall purpose as Morris seems to cover a wide variety of topics, but does so in a pleasing way. The martial artist can get some great insights from this book such as:Being a martial artist is not what you do, but what you are.If you just want to win fights, then go and buy a shotgun.In short, Morris takes you through some of his history in the martial arts and at the same time gives you some useful insights into martial arts philosophy. He spends a great deal of time focused on how meditation fits into the martial arts. I found this book interesting and enjoyed it. It is a book that addressed a part of the martial arts which many books neglect to address - meditation and the mind.Bohdi Sanders, author of Warrior Wisdom: Ageless Wisdom for the Modern Warrior"
4,very useful addition,This works very well with the Pawleys hammock stand. The drink holders should be a little deeper for more stability. The table area could be a little bigger. The metal tube that attaches to the leg of the hammock stand should be padded some how so as not to scrape off the powder-coat and subject the whole thing to corrosion.
1,Hi-Quality Sound Bytes...,"If what you're looking for is a collection of really well-recorded clips of a single chorus of each of 48 great big band tunes - this is the CD for you. Tragically, I failed to read the reviews before purchasing this item, and the ""track"" list led me to believe I was getting the whole thing -- shame on me. As always with Enoch Light, the quality of the performances and of the recording are exceptional. Unfortunately, there's only enough to whet your appetite; it certainly didn't accomplish my intended replacement for vinyl recordings."
1,Severely Abridged,"The Strangest Secret for Succeeding in the World Today is a valuable CD / tape course that I've listened to often (having borrowed it from the public library), and I was looking forward to adding this title to my personal reference collection. Unfortunately, this book - with the same title as the audio course, and denoted as being the ""Deluxe Edition"" no less, seems to contain about 10% (maybe less) of the audio program content. From this perspective, this tiny volume is a big disappointment."
3,You get what you pay for....,"If your looking for temporary wine rack that will hold you over until you can buy a nice one, this is the one for you. Cheaply made and does not stand up on it's own. If you do not anchor it to a wall it does not stand up. Holds the bottles fine and for something to put in my basement and be seen it does the trick. But like the old saying goes, you get what you pay for and I should have payed a little more and gotten a nicer one."
3,It'll work,"Nice and sturdy, but it doesn't appear that it would be at first. I was a little disappointed that the bottom rows are for small bottles and the top rows is for bigger bottles (but you could put a regular sized bottle in any of them). I thought I'd be able to put my big heavier bottles on the bottom... seems a little backwards to me.Overall, I'm glad I bought it. I would buy again."
5,Great Retelling of a Great Classical Tale,Part of our homeschooling curriculum on Minoan culture. Kids loved the book nice easy read for them and well illustrated.
4,Ishtar is the best from Europe,"This album is one of the best by Ishtar. If you like a different kind of music from than a typical western or Eastern music, then this album is for you. Ishtar combines Middle Eastern and the Western music into a fasinating and beautiful sounds and lyrics which you can listen to over and over. She is the best singer to come around in a long time."
4,Insights into Nazi Germany,"""Thinking of Germany at Night"" provides a perspective on Nazi Germany through the eyes of an impressionable young man. From the strict disciplinarians of prep school to the National Labor Service and finally as a soldier on the Russian Front, Rainulf Stelzmann depicts the struggles of a German student preceding, during and following World War II. His account shows no one was immune to the evils of the Nazi regime. It is a poignant book that both illuminates a bleak era in German history and is relevant to our own time!"
2,"very average,but some laughs","I saw this Movie the Other night&it was a very basic type of Film,but it had some Moments in there that made Me Laughing. I dug it when the Cats were Capping on a Couple of other dudes.the Owner of the Cleaners was rocking a Red Suit&One of the cats called Him ""BeattleJuice"" which had me rolling. it was some alright Snaps on One another in this film."
1,RED GRANT MEET,I WAS HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE--THERE WAS ONLY ONE SCENCE IN IT THAT WAS WORTH WATCHING...............................
1,High cost for delivery and very poor packaging.,"The card itself is pretty neat - for my three year old. However for a $4.50 delivery charge I would expect firm packaging which is not the case. The manufacturer ships themselves so the shame and blame is all on them - card was dinged/bent.For the card, if not damaged, I would give 4 stars."
1,only for die-hard Paxton fans,"Are you the type of Bill Paxton fan (like myself) who admires the actor so much that you are driven to see movies like ""Thunderbirds"" and ""Spy Kids 2"" simply because he is in them? If so, then you will definitely want to check out this amateurish anthology flick, which features Paxton as a nutjob who preys on weak college students to find a place to live. It's not exactly Paxton at his finest, but then, he's got fairly terrible material to work with, so you can't fault him too much.The premise is that customers at a Virtual Reality psychology clinic have nightmares while they are undergoing whatever procedure they are undergoing. Possibly this is based on a comic book, as someone is holding a comic named ""Future Shock"" during a short behind-the-scenes in the special features. Does it matter? No. This is a bad movie no matter where its sources lie.Paxton fanatics, check it out. Everyone else, donate the money you were going to spend to charity."
5,Bill Paxton Rocks!,"Sometimes Bill Paxton accepts suckie-movie roles obviously for the big-studio paycheck (such as Disney's dreadful ""MIGHTY JOE YOUNG"" or the painfully bad ""MORNING STAR""). But occassionally Paxton appears in really cutting edge entertainment just for the craft (i.e. ""NEAR DARK"") and is this case ""FUTURE SHOCK."" Granted, some viewers might not like the three-part structure of this independent thriller. But for pure entertainment, you can't find better than Paxton's super-dark and hilarious turn as the demented ROOMMATE. This is really classic stuff."
5,Perfect for hammock storage,This item works just as described and suits my needs perfect. The length is great and it has a drawstring closure that will protect your hammock while it is in storage. I keep my hammock in this bag on my covered patio when not in use and it has been great. I would recommend this for anyone that wants to protect their hammock from the elements.
4,At Christmas the Heart Goes Home,"The item sent is just what I ordered. We have listened to it a couple times so it seems to be in good shape. We listened to our previous tape so much it simply wore out, so hopefully we'll get another 20 years out of this one.Thanks."
4,great deal,"I looked for this book based on a recommendation in Stephen King's autobiography, and was very happy to find it on Amazon. I received it within the promised time, and it was in good condition. Would buy from this seller again."
4,Great optics,"Bought this for my dad's new .22 hornet.After getting his loads down the way he wanted, he's getting excellent grouping at 200 yards with this scope. He tells me this is now one of his favorites."
3,Guns N' Roses - Welcome to the Videos,I guess I am a fan up to November Rain and then the Videos get a little goffey for me. I enjoy the music but did not care for the last few videos. I thought they were stupid. Call me an Appetite for Destruction fan more than the later stuff.
3,Incomplete!,"Why is ""You Could Be Mine"" not included here? Maybe it's related to Arnold or the song being in the movie, but it's very unsatisfying to watch this and see no YCBM on it. Also, I wish Sweet Child O'Mine could have been the full version of the song (without the truncated intro), but that's not the band's fault I would guess, but the record label. Anyway, this is a standard DVD so it looks lame in terms of picture quality, but converted to 320x240 AVC and playing on my PSP it looks great!"
3,Nostalgic but weak,"Seeing the old videos for Gn'R was cool but it needed more. Some live cuts, interviews about the videos, something. I guess for the price it's worth it. Would like to see an official release of Live at the Ritz in 88'. I don't know if it's up to them or Mtv but that was a great show."
5,I LOVE GUNS N' ROSES,"HI,I just want to say GUNS N' ROSES are dead,it's hard to say but,we're realisticts & we've to understand the truth,I REALLY REALLY MISS THOSE GUYS,ILREALLY MISS the best W. AXL ROSE,I'm so sorry,cause they're gone & us the fans,what 'bout us?.I HOPE ONE OF THESE DAYS GN'R COMEBACK & they could be the same of 7-yrs-ago.We can write 'em and tell 'em ""COMEBACK PLEASE"""
1,Sound is horrible!,"I was very excited when I heard that the whole video collection of my favorite band was going to be released on DVD. I've been waiting for this for a long time.I finally received the disc a couple of days ago, but oh, what a disappointment! The sound is just horrible, unbearable.The sound is too harsh, contains a lot of treble, it seems like it's over-compressed or something, and then they have raised the high frequencies. At Patience, the whistling is scratchy and noisy, and after that I couldn't watch it no more. I've asked to return this."
5,I'm Axl Rose,"people, this is Axl rose as i fxcking happen to be here so just fxcking buy this damn awesome video you fxckers Its simply the best rose"
4,Great....unless your a skint tosser,"i luved it, missing a few videos (u cud be mine, dnt cry-but u hav the 2nd version i think, cnt remember if its origianl lyrics or not)true there isnt addtional features but hopefully this is a step forawrd for the band with their new album chinese democracy cumin out this yr i think (dnt buy it if slash aint bak and they still hav the f*kin keyboardist-what's wrong with axl???????? if any1 noes any more info about plez tell me!!!), if ur a fan buy it, if ur a skint c*nt who cry's over noffin the just f*k off"
5,Great Vids!,Just a well done compilation of Guns n' Roses song 'videos' along with awesome footage from past concerts for the Paradise City cut.Very enjoyable to sit back and enjoy these guys doing what they do best.A must for anyone who would turn up their radio whenever GNR came on!Get one and and enjoy...
4,Nice addition to my collection,"I could give it a 5 star rating but it has only dolby 2.1 stereo sound, i just wish it has a 5.1 or a dts option."
5,greatest videos ever!!,"GN'R made the best rock videos ever. ""November Rain"" was voted MTV's music video of the decade! If you are a GN'R fan, u should buy this video. It has all the hits: ""Sweet Child"", ""Welcome.jungle"" ""Patience"", ""estranged"" ""Paradise city"" ""the garden"" ""Live..die"" plus more hits"
5,The best music videos ever made...,"This is one of the greatest video tapes i have ever seen. It has all of the great Guns n' Roses videos that EVERYBODY knows and loves. Even if someone doesn't like Guns n' Roses, they will love the videos on this tape. GNR Forever!!!"
1,BUYER BEWARE ~audio is bad~ DVD RECALL IS NEEDED,"Dear GunsN'Roses fans, I exchanged this DVD and the 2nd copy had the same problem as the first. The audio has these high and low points. The volume on a few of the videos went from the volume I had my television set on, then it went down to a lower volume on it's own, then back up. It's a shame because I would really like to have these videos on DVD, however I will be returning this 2nd copy and demanding a full refund. If you bought a copy of this DVD and the audio isn't messed up, hang onto it because you're lucky. I did notice after the fact that there are some other reviews from people that had the same problem with their copy. So buy at your own risk.(...): Exchanged once again because refund was refused. Same problem with 3rd copy. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM!! Save yourself the trouble, time and money."
5,read it you will like it,A very interesting and well written book. If you enjoy reading a historical novel that is true to life you should read this book.
5,The Shiloh Legacy,"Excellent series. Made me cry. Gives you a taste of what it felt like to be a black person after WWII, and also what it felt like to lie through the great depression."
5,Great Read,This book is such a great read. I read it before and rarely do I read the same book more then once. This got me emotionally invested now as it did the first time around. I am reading book two of the series and I highly recomend these books.
4,A Great Book,"Bodie Thoene has always been one of my top Christian authors, and this was another great book. I really enjoy how the Shiloh Legacy, Zion Covenant, and Zion Chronicles all involve the same group of characters. You really establish a relationship with all of them when you can see how their families have intertwined over the years. Though I've read both of the Zion series, this is the first chance I've had to read this book, and I liked having a background to all the characters in the other series. For everyone who enjoys good books with a complex plot and compelling characters, this is a great book to read!"
4,fall out of the chair funny,"This album is basically a collection of absurd commercial jingle parodies with convincingly overwrought synthesizer, memorable melodies and easily some of the funniest lyrics I've heard. The bulk of the good tracks are in the first half of the cd but is extremely listenable throughout even if you're not zooted.This is an excellent live group as well."
2,"Well done, but worthless","I realy like the artwork and the level of detail of the different traps that are described.So for that part, the book is surely worth your money.However, there is no rules on trapconstruction (sure they are in the DMG and ""Song And Silence"".The traps you find have no calculated prices.The advice on building puzzles is nice, but building a puzzle that fits in your campaign still is up to your imagination.Some of the traps are smart, but all in all, I feel this book does not offer you anything.As a DM setting up traps is the fun and joy of the game and if you need this book to do that, I think you should consider asking one of your players to take over DM'ing.After all, what is being a DM about besides setting up traps and ""ugly"" encounters?The content of the book would urge me to give it one star only, but the pro's mentioned in the first lines have raised it to two..... (doubt doubt doubt doubt....)"
3,Reasonable for generic adventuring,"I'd hoped for a bit more emphasis on traps and puzzles, and instead found a tome filled with what I would describe as ""encounters.""At the worst, there are some rather odd interpretations of what sort of odd encounters one might theoretically find in a dungeon, but there are so many presuppositions to the encounters as to render them useless in any but the most generic ways.That said, there are some interesting ideas in a few of the encounters, and the scaling of the encounters to match party levels is solid.If you're desperate to add some random (and I do mean random) encounters, take a look, but generally speaking I'd recommend finding longer modules with better story arcs."
2,Book of Challenges -- a challenge to use it!,"The format of the book is less useful. I was expecting something closer to a Monster Manual but for traps, and I was disappointed. Each ""challenge"" is formatted like a mini-encounter rather than a single trap or puzzle explained. Some challenges are 2-3 pages long. I prefer a bit more quick-use format structure so I can just pull out the encounter and plop it into my adventure just like a monster from the Monster Manual. I prefer Traps & Treachery by Fantasy Flight Games which has that type of structure."
1,what a waste,"I thought this book would be chalk full of traps and challenge ideas for dungeons/caves etc, but it turns out to really just have four examples of setting where there are challenges. So you buy a book, to possibly place four ideas in your adventures and that's it. It is the worst buy I have ever made for a role playing acessory."
4,Not quite as billed...,"This book makes it sound like it's a primer for playing logic games with your players. And it's got those. But about half of the book is also how to make combat creative by putting the creatures on superior footing and giving them tactics to match. Even so, I'm still satisfied with my purchase."
1,New to both authors,"Based upon listening to this program, I'm not inclined to hear any more of what either guy has to say. Dyer takes the first half - starting with a long, metaphorical story before s-l-o-w-l-y filling out his time to (finally!) state that you need a firmly fixed idea of what you DO want, because concentrating on eliminating negatives in your life only gives them more power/energy from those thoughts. Chopra takes a scientific approach with a long discussion of energy and matter. Their talks did not seem not integrated; they must have split the promotional cost of the event, each guy gave his own (individual) spiel, then they split the take at the door afterwards."
3,Not the best way to buy this music,"This 33-minute compilation consists of the remastered contents of two 12"" EPs. However, if you don't mind losing the original artwork, all eight tracks are also available in freshly re-mastered sound onLullabies to Violaine, Vol. 1, along with 24 other tracks, at a modest price."
5,Great album,"This is a really great album. I really enjoyed listening to it and the best part is I got it from a local Half Price Books in their CD clearance for only $1. Best $1 ever spent, but would have paid retail for it."
3,This is sad...,"I can not believe Amazon would price this CD so highly when I found it elsewhere for 8 dollars. It may be overseas but for crying out loud, what type of smuggling ring are you guys doing here?"
5,This CD is great for Inuyasha fans,"This album is really great. The disc contains every beginning and ending song from all seasons of Inuyasha. It contains very great music from J-pop and J-rock artists like Ayumi Hamasaki and Do As Infinity. If you dont like J-pop or J-rock then I suggest you stay away from this CD.Even though I don't own this CD, a friend lent it to me and I practically fell in love with it on my first listen. I think that the best songs on this CD are ""Dearest"" by Ayumi Hamasaki, ""Shinjitsu No Uta"" and ""Fukai Mori"" by Do As Infinity, ""Owarinai Yume"" by Nanase Aikawa, and ""My Will"" by Dream. I like to think of this CD as an Ultamate J-pop/J-rock compilation album. It's really a really good CD with some really good songs. REALLY!!!"
1,Restricted from Importing - Not Indicated by Amazon.com,This CD is great but I do not support any mechanisms that restrict me from importing the music into my iTunes software and iPod. This CD does not allow importing the songs.
4,My Son Likes it - He's 4,"Lot's of songs. Some are a bit of a strange fit - purple people eater, a song about the waltz, do your ears hang low with the biggles.....and a very long commercial at the end. All that being said, my son loves it. ""See you later alligator"" is his favorite because of the catchy tune and the good video footage of alligators. They should have a choice to jump past the commentary and into the songs but they don't......it's a bit long."
5,Technology and the Fate of Modern Society,"George Grant, is a subtle and penetrating thinker with regard to technology and the fate of modern society. In this slim volume, Grant in a series of essays details the need to find a way to think about technology, i.e., the way we view technology and its impact on society.By discussing a diversity of thinkers such as Simone Weil, Nietsche, Plato and Heidegger as well as that on the issues of euthanasia and abortion, he has shown to us the historical fate of modern society which is infatuated with technology. The picture he painted is not pretty but I believe that one must have the courage to see historical reality as it is and not shy away from it. Only then, can we begin to look at ways to avoid the coming ruins of modern technological civilization.All in all, a very important book for anyone who is concerned with the fate of modern society."
1,Recorded fro vinyl and at different volume levels,Real shame this one as this out of print cd is finally available via Amazon HOWEVER!!!!!!Dont waste your money as this is recorded from a bad vinyl source whos volume drops half way through songs!!!!.Really dont know how Amazon can say CD R audio quality as this is i think is missleading.I think this product should be withdrawn.
1,SHAME SHAME SHAME,WELL WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS CD THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID NOTHING JUST STAY AWAY DON'T BUY IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE. YOUR BETTER OF TRYING TO FIND THE REAL CDON THE 2001 LABEL AUDIO BOOK ABM THATS THE REAL DEAL CD.AND YES I HAVE IT I ORDERED THIS FAKE SOUNDING CD FOR A XMAS GIFT FOR MY BROTHER AND HE HEARD IT AND SLAP THE (SHUT YO MOUTH OUT) OF ME LOL!.
2,an aquired taste,"This type music is an aquired taste, and is like nothing you have heard unless you live within 1000 miles of this part of the world. When you first hear it it sounds like cats fighing or fingernails on a chalk board."
3,Updated old school thrash,"Gave this album a listen through the Rhapsody online service. Surprisingly good stuff! These metalheads from the Basque Country mix up old school thrash with a smattering of power metal here and there. If you like old Megadeath, Overkill, etc. it's probably worth your time to find a copy of this album."
3,"PLEASE DIADORA, MORE POCKETS!","Being a lifetime soccer player, I am no stranger to Diadora products. They are usually the better ones in the soccer line. As for this bag, it is sturdy and well made, and I really dig the soccerball net.However, one thing that really makes me think I would not have purchased this bag in the first place had I known: It has ONE small pocket on the side. Cmon really? Any athlete in the world will tell you various pockets are needed for keys, wallet, cell phone (can't be together for fear of being scratched), ipod, etc., etc. A little suprised D. would release this bag.That being said, if dont mind that, it is a good bag otherwise."
4,Perfect for my purpose,"The description states 4 zippered pockets. I only see the main compartment, an extremely small and vented side pocket, and a net on the other side. There are no zipper pockets elsewhere. The description is misleading!Other than that, this bag suits me for everything I need it for. I commute to college everyday so I carry books, laptop, change of clothes, towel, and food. They all fit in with some room to spare. I use the net to carry my water bottle and attach a padlock to it as well for gym locker, which this bag is the perfect fit. In the zipper pocket, I store my writing utensils. There is a pad on the bottom to provide shape to the bag when its not as full. The black is much darker than what appears in the picture.Overall, this is a great bag and I would recommend it, just make sure you know it does not have all the pockets as described."
4,decent,"was smaller than i expected. Be aware of how small it is before you purchase this to make sure its what you're looking for. Also, the fact that it doesnt have side pockets is pretty annoying. The side string thing is pretty useless."
4,Great Bag,PROS:+ Sized for gym lockers.+ Fits everything.+ No gripes.+ Good-to-go.IMPROVEMENTS:~ Could have a couple more compartments on the sides.
2,Disapointed in this gym bag,"This bag looked great in the picture, and the reviews were good. However, these were the issues I had with this item. The first things is the the netting on the end pocket is very thick (the rope used could be much, much thinner, this thick rope is cumbersome and unnecessary). Also, the spaces between the netting is way too large, anything I put in the pocket, just falls right through onto the floor, such as keys (not a good thing, unreliable pocket). Also, I expected some kind of side pouch/pocket with several little compartments inside, for like a gym card, jewelry or pad lock. There was none. Only the two pockets. The zippered one on one end and the horrible netted pocket on the other side. This bags is not very functional, could be a lot better but really missed the mark."
1,Won't last long,"This pedometer lasted about 4 or 5 days. After that the display went all strange and completely unreadable. It didn't get wet, I didn't drop it, it just suddenly stopped working."
4,Great Fishing line!,"I purchased some of the 10lb. Fireline in green. I have used it for many hours for trout fishing on my spinning reel. I have no curl or coil problems like I did with mono lines. The line has a solid feel when a strike occurs. When I hang a limb and need to break off, the line does not fray and it breaks at or close to the knot. You may be tempted to buy larger pound capacity line because it is so small a diameter, Don't! Get the poundage you normally get and enjoy the better lure action and catch more fish! I have noticed that the crimp on weights slip easily up the line if you don't pay special attention to crimping them real well. I have fished with Berkly products for over 40 years, this is the best line from them to date.I give it only four stars because of the high price of the product. While I agree it is way superior to mono, it is still to costly."
5,Great for bead stitching,"I'm not a fisherman, I use this line for beading. It's strong, inconspicuous, and the ends don't fray when you thread a needle. I rarely use anything else for bead stitching."
5,Not just for fishing anymore!,"This stuff is amazing.......for beading. It's super strong, very easy to thread through a needle and unlike some other beading threads, doesn't give a stiff feel to beaded jewelry. I've used it to make bracelets, rings and necklaces and even though it's white in color, it's fine enough not to show or detract from the color of the beads. If it came in clear it would be perfect. I've also tried the smoke color but it's coating tends to slough off and bunch up and needs to be cleaned as you go. If fishing isn't your thing but beading is, you need to try Berkley Fireline."
1,Pathetic Oxford. Very Pathetic,This is the worst attempt by the people at Oxford. I am a big fan of all of their books and series but this one needs to be redone. The writing by all of the authors is terrible and no detail is given. While it is tough to cover the whole history of the country in one book this one fails miserably. Not only do you not even get a sense of how Italy developed you is left wondering what the point was. It does not leave you wanting more information in a good way but just disappoints. Stay away!
4,"the ""volk"" at oxford have ""done it"" again...although this time less vigorously","The first essay begins with an obscure reference to a former pupil who, ""in those few fleeting moments of ecstacy during my office hours instilled in me enormous feelings of guilt because so much blood rushed from my neo-cortex in her presence that I knew then I would change my academic specialty from Etruscan Art in Etruria to Etruria and its Etruscan Art"" and then concludes with, of all things, a clarion call for Anschluss with Canada. Strange. The essay on Mussolini was brilliant, hampered only by the author's insistent mis-spelling of Mussolini's first name (""Young 'Bonero' earned early for himself a reputation as a pugnacious little turd, although he was an above average speller!"")A weird book from the weirdos at Oxford. They've done it again! I only wish I could do it again. Just once."
3,My Seat Covers,Dodge Ram Head Logo Universal Bucket Seat CoverWell I got it alot sooner than expected.As a female trying to hook my car up it was fairly easy and I just love how it complements the rest of my dodge stuff for my car.Only flaw is if you have a newer model like i do then the two strings in the front won't stretch to the back.Just tuck them under and it will be fine.
4,Corvette toe ring,"Hard to purchase something like this on line. Turns out the logo is not as visible as it appeared in the photos, and there is sort of a ""barb"" on it that we will have to file down a bit, otherwise..."
5,Understand the basics of quantum physics in an afternoon,"As an adult reading this book, easy enough for children to understand, I absolutely loved it! The basic concepts of quantum physics is explained in fun and easy-to-follow formats with examples and experiments for you to try. This book has definitely perked my interest in physics and I intend to find similar books to learn more. I borrowed this book from my local library, but now intend to buy it so that my children can read it and we can discuss the experiments suggested in the book. I think this book will inspire children and adults to learn more about the world we live in. I read this book in an afternoon. It is easy, fun, and interesting reading, and only 53 pages of larger print writing with many diagrams."
4,Kid Friendly and Thoughtful,"As an elementary school teacher previewing science books for my students, I can appreciate how well this book speaks to kids. Patricia Topp has done a wonderful job breaking down quantum physics concepts into kid friendly language and diagrams. This book helped me clarify my own basic background knowledge in physics. The simple experiments that she suggests in every chapter are completely age appropriate and illustrate complicated science concepts in an accessible way. I'm excited to have this on the classroom science shelf this year!"
1,Size is not standard,"I bought 2 shoes from this brand:Stacy Adams Men's Madison 00049 Cap Toe Shoes,Black Kid/Lizard Print,12 DStacy Adams Men's Madison 00049 Cap Toe Shoes,Chestnut Kid/Lizard Print,12 DThe size was not standard, it is larger than the standard size. I paid price, international shipping and customs duty, but It was larger than my size about 1 inch. I do not advice to buy this item online."
2,Rehash of free TV,"The material and presentation are decent, but this look at Pope John Paul is basically a ABC free broadcast from quite a while back, transfered to DVD-- and asking for your money. Some of the bonus features are strong (tho, again, rehashed TV), but Diane Sawyer in the Papal Apartments is typical annoying Diane: the focus is all on her, not the Vatican and certainly not John Paul II. A better bet is NBC's DVD, ""NBC Presents: The Life of Pope John Paul II"" -- with fresh material created just for DVD release."
4,Serves its purpose and great customer service.,"I bought this to make a hot/clammy memory foam mattress bearable. While I hated to throw more money at a new bed that wasn't working out, it has saved an otherwise unfortunate situation. The bed is now comfy, breathes well and has much better temperature regulation.I'm not sure how the straps will do in the long run, but sofar its OK. The only thing I don't like is how my new bed already looks like it sags in the center b/c the wool is a bit compressed. -Then again, thats understandable so no real complaints here.Overall highly satisfied. The customer service team both emailed and called to ensure they had all the proper info and to let me know the expected delivery date. Very pleasant staff."
1,Wrong Description,This will not fit a BR style box. It is a CH style breaker.The ad states specifically for a BR load center.
4,How I wish for the paperback!,"I teach on the Civil War and Reconstruction at the college level, and I so wish that LSU Press would publish this book as a paperback.It is available only in hardcover. The resulting price tag is the only thing that keeps me from assigning Sanders to my students. It's ideal for undergraduate history courses, as his writing, arguments, and revisions are all crystal-clear. I applaud Sanders."
5,Light duty vinyl garden hose,"Exactly what I wanted and needed for my small garden, a light weight, easy to use hose. Very flexible, extends easily and stores in secs. Love it."
4,Excellent CD for Chess Lovers,"My children absolutely love all but the last track. One of the songs ""Queen's Rook Pawn"" is now one of the most popular music selections in my second grade son's class. Good for children and adults alike. The more you know about chess, the more you will like this CD."
1,Unsafe?,Although I've never tried this [in searching for an adult soft mattress] I recently came across a warning against soft mattresses [like air beds] for infants because of the risk of SIDS. I'm concerned that a soft mattress pad might offer the same risk so I thought I'd raise this concern here. [Probably will not check back for responses though.]
4,One of Her BEST,"Awesome book, great charactors as usual. Susan Elizabeth Phillips gives us one more book with a spin off the the Chicago Stars' (which began back in ""It Had to be You"" You'll be captured in this lovable tale of two people needing everything and finding each other."
1,"Hey, this is not a good story","I enjoy reading Susan Elizabeth Phillips and I think that she is an excellent writer. My favorites are KISS AN ANGEL and NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE. The latter story was a bit silly but it was funny. I didn't care for the hero in Dream A Little Dream. Reminded me too much of Linda Howard's earlier work, Sarah's Child, another story I didn't like by another talented writer. I couldn't finish this book, if that tells you anything. I thought the hero a jerk and just couldn't sympathize with him despite the circumstances. I just don't care for plotlines like this one and will avoid them all in future."
5,I'LL GIVE THIS A HUNDRED STARS IF I COULD!,"It is a very heartwarming story. I've read almost all of Susan Elizabeth Phillips books and this one ranks as one of the best . It is about a story of a man who almost lost hope when suddenly a woman brought him back from from his grave and made him live again. It has a different twist from all the other romance books I've read, and the twist made it more lovable and definitely a tear-jerker. It delves deeper on human emotions... it's not a mushy, mushy kind of book but a very realistic one. Often times we find ourselves on the brink of giving up like Gabe had but then people that surrounds us gives us comfort and a reason to move on... And yes..... I've read the book 20 times."
4,An enjoyable novel,"Considering it was an impulse buy, I must say that I felt this novel was quite good. SEP managed quite successfully to engage me for the hour or two it took to read the book. The character of Gabe was veryinteresting as I don't think I ever grew to really like him...but that isn't really the purpose of a book. Rachael was in love with him and their romance was the object of the book. The mother and child relationship evoked a strong response form my sister and I, and I applaud SEP's sensitive and engaging presentation of one of the most important facets of our lives."
4,Amusing but poignant,"Susan Elizabeth Phillips writes the best dialogue of any author I've ever read. She's never trite or ""cute"" but can be downright laugh out loud funny. At the same time her story line is interesting and her characters are well developed. I have read her books over and over but don't tire of them, rather it's like revisiting old friends and this book is no exception. I ordered this book on tape but was disappointed in the quality of the tapes. Only one or two of the tapes weren't distorted. It was used and had been a library tape before being sold to me."
5,Great Read,"I have enjoyed all of Susan Elizabeth Phillips books, this is one of the better ones. Always engaging and full of fun!"
4,"different from her other work, but still excellent","I just finished this book, and was a little surprised. I didn't like it nearly as much as Nobody's baby but Mine, and I found myself wishing for a little more of the humor from her other books. However, this book was very sexy, but you found yourself wishing that Rachel had run over all the Bonners with her broken down car! I don't know if I could have put up with being a pariah, even for love."
5,Not a true SEP fan,"With a 'million' reviews already written, I just wanted to express my opinion. It is a good book. Great dialog. Rachel is one of my favorite female leads. Definitely a keeper."
4,not her best,"I have read all her books and loved every one of them. This latest was not as funny, the characters were not as well developed, and the story was not as good. It is a good book, but all her other books are better."
4,"Yay, a new author to read!","The first I've read by SEP. I don't want to repeat what so many others have said, so I'll just tell you my favorite part. I read tons of romance books and this one was really different. Not only the plot, but the characters were really believable, really grabbed at the heartstrings, especially the main character and the little boy."
5,loved it!!!!,"I loved this book....but I was a little sad because she's told the story of everyone in the Bonner family, and now will have to start with a new set of characters. Susan Elizabeth Phillips' books always deliver, and provide hours of entertainment, although Dream a Little Dream wasn't as funny as some of the others.....but definately a great read. I highly recommend her books."
5,Thank goodness for mistakes!!!!!,"The book club I belonged to before my Amazon days accidentally sent me this book instead of the Nora Roberts book I ordered. I stayed up all night reading and the next day bought every one of Phillips' titles. Susan Elizabeth Phillips is a master of the craft! Dream a Little Dream is a bit different from most of her others. You'll need Kleenex, but by the end of the book you'll understand the redeeming power of love."
5,Read it,Wonderful continuation of Nobody's Baby but Mine. Getting to know Cal Bonner's 2 brothers and more details on the family are highly delightful. I was delighted!
5,Sassy,"It was a briliant balance of class, attitude and strength. The kind of woman you would treasure as a close friend. She seemed brutally honest and darring to a fault. Discovering that life is not black or white but contains several shades of gray. i am biting my nails waiting for a second run with this author."
4,Susan Phillips is always welcome,"When I want to relax at the end of the day, I do so enjoy firing up my Kindle and hving a new Phillips book waiting for me."
4,"Feasted On: Chicago Stars Series, Book 4","4 out of 5 stars!! This book was GREAT!!!!!! I LOVED Rachel & Gabe as a couple!! Plus, finding out what else happened for the Bonner family was icing on the cake! Then the cherry on top was the secondary story of Pastor Ethan (Gabe & Cal's younger brother) & Kristy. =0) If I gush any more then you'll know what will happen in the book so ... I just say .... GO READ IT!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and two teasers on my blog)"
3,"Page-turner, but romance for the Mommy-van crowd...","Enjoyable, but sappy with the son Edward and all her holier-than-thou sacrifices for him and the sudden turn of Gabe's feeling for Edward (a.k.a. Chip - how dumb was that?) was all too quick and convenient. Give me a break, in one day? I enjoyed the story, and read it quickly. Rachel & Gabe had good chemistry, and I loved the scenes at the cottage which sounded dreamy."
3,14k yellow ball lever-back earrings,"The ball is much smaller than expected. Apart from that, we are happy with the product."
2,Not very good,If you are interested in old school rap do not buy this album. It doesn't even have any catchy beats. I advise you to leave this one alone.
4,More realistic than POW-film,"Master sgt Frank Detimore was captured during cross border operation in 1970. Held as POW until 1981 he manages to smuggle a letter to his family. His wife meets with Frank's ex recon team members (curiously .. usually only 3 Americans in a recon team: one-zero, one-one, and radio operator -- see Plaster, SOG, 1990). Five ex Green Berets begin PT, shooting, jumping, planning, avoiding DIA. They are infiltrated by a private military company ... with fund from Frank's family.They recon the camp, eliminate sentry, and storm. To their surprise, Frank inform them another POW camp is exist. The PMC refuses to exfil them, they are pinned by battalion sized Vietnam army, casualities are mounted ... their angel now is CIA-led mercenary. More realistic than a film."
2,Not to pleased,"I have used the 1st blade of ten received. I found the metal soft and tip of each end seems to fold over causing the balance to be off and the edger shimmies un-controllably. I have double checked the installation of blade, it's correct. When I took a grinder and took the folded edge off, the unit was stable again....maybe I received a bad batch or the blades just aren't good quality. This is the point where I wished I paid the extra at home depot so I could simply take them back without hassle."
4,"Good, easy read","Makes you think and consider your own existence and contributions. A book that makes you reflect on your own life, and sticks with you awhile- I like that."
2,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP....","These sheets feel like hotel sheets. (Even after a few cycles in the washer and fabric softner)The fitted and flat sheet is only printed on one side as well as the pillow cases. The fitted sheet and pillowcases aren't of any concern because you only see the printed side anyway. However, the flat sheet looks tacky. The quality of the rest of the bed set is great and looks fabulous. I expected more out of these sheets! What a shame."
5,Love Whitman,Walt Whitman is by far my favorite poet of all time. I can read his poems over and over again and find out more and more subtle meanings and I just love it. This collection is a must have for Whitman lovers and poetry lovers alike.
3,not much on growing aloe vera,less than a page on taking care of the aloe vera plant. This is why I miss book stores - I would have known in a moment the book wouldn't say much about growing the plants. I just purchased 3 aloe vera plants from amazon and wanted some advice.
2,eh ok....,"Not a big fan. Maybe its my fault for not researching this book before I bought it. Its an extremely small book, like 45 pgs. Good information, but nothing the internet could not tell you for free. Its a cheap book so dont expect much."
3,Nice handbook,"This book is cheap, can be skimmed through quickly, and is small enough to be a handy reference guide when needed. I keep mine by my Aloe plant. (I skimmed, but actually haven't gone back to 'read' it fully yet, though my friend did & liked it). :)"
5,SHAZZAM! WHAT A VOICE!,"Jim Nabors becomes a totally different person when you hear him sing, especially at Christmas. His rendition of ""O Holy Night,: stands among the most pure and inspirational renditions of that immortal Christmas solo. For our family, it's just NOT CHRISTMAS without his voice as part of our Christmas traditions."
1,Overated former teacher tries to cash in.,The author sells herself as a concerned teacher but what is obvious from the book is that she is just another businesswoman trying to sell some vague pontifications to the general public.
4,Good Capture of Offshoring Movement,"Stuart Morstead and Greg Blount have developed an excellent book on ""Offsourcing"" - outsourcing to an offshore vendor. Of particluar interest to me were the numbers - over 9000 companies providing offsourcing services, 900 in India and 1000 in the Philippines, cost savings in the 35 - 65% range, etc. Their treatise on business case -> roadmap -> restructuring was very enlightening and can be used as a guide by anyone tasked with making the case for offshore outsourcing.The Offsourcing Maturity Model (OMM) and its similarities to the bulky SEI CMM was an interesting sideline discussion. Case studies and advice on operational methods are also included. It is very clear that the authors have a large level of experience in this area of offshore outsourcing. Overall, one of the best books on this topic!"
5,just what i needed!,This was just what I wanted! Works great! Priced right! Such an easy program! I have to use Lotus Approach at work & wanted the program at home in case I need to key in something or check something. Was so excited to find it since it was '97.
2,Donated to the public library......,.....just not for me......I've bought three of his books...I just don't care for them...Journeying - the Soul's Path to Freedom....I will be donating this one to the public library also!~
5,"Answers, Finally.","So mucy of what happened during the political development of Micronesia now come to light as a result of this well researched book. Until now, much of what transpired during the political status negotiations required tedious search in US government archives or the Library of Congress (if unclassified). Insightful!"
3,"Sanyo VAR-L20U, worth it but same as you have.","Sanyo Battery Charger works great. From the picture it looks like it's one piece and plugs directly into the wall, perfect for travel, but it isn't. It has a power cord just like the OEM... Nothing different"
4,"Small, Compact, Gets the Job Done.","I'm glad I didn't purchase a universal charger for $14; it's well worth the extra money for the official Sanyo charger. Plus if you are signed up for Prime, you get 2-day free shipping!Negatives:- Need to use provided power cord- Gets alittle warm when chargingPositives:- Gets the job done- Not as big as $14 universal battery chargers"
3,Good Defensive Racket,"After purchasing the Carlos Chiu racket, I was curious to how the Kenji would feel in comparison. The latter is significantly slower than the former, and it's enough to affect my gameplay. I lean more towards offense, and this racket wouldn't allow me to hit the ball as hard as I like, unlike the Carlos which completely whips the ball. Another thing that took a little adjusting was the curved handle, something I haven't seen before. I didn't like it too much, but there were other players who found it appealing.If your gameplay is more defensive, this would be a good racket for you, and the price is very modest. The spin is good and control is excellent. Just don't expect insane ball speeds during gameplay."
2,It's so & so,The spin & speed not worth the price marking. A $20 paddle could have provide similar performance.
5,The perfect book for cold war history readers.,"The Spy Who Saved The World has been one of the best cold war reads I have discovered. It is well written and provided me with a vivid and detailed glimpse of the lives of all involved. If you think the cold war is an interesting topic, then you owe it to yourself to find a copy of this book, read it and then display it with pride on your book shelf."
5,An enjoyable read!!,"I picked up this book at the grocery store when I was desperate for something to read while visiting relatives. What a joy! Although this was my first Jan Jeffry novel, it's not my last!Jane Jeffry and her friend Shelly Nowack offer some laughs while they work to solve a crime. In this case they signed up to take a gardening class when the instructor is attacked and the substitute instructor is killed. While Jane juggles house work, raising children and a gardening class, her and her friend work to solve a the murder.If I could rate it a 4+ I would have done that or a 5-. Mainly because I thought the ending was a little bit abrupt. However, it was a great read and I'm buying more of her books today.Enjoy."
3,Not Churchill's best outing,"As a big fan of Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffry series,I must say this isn't her best effort. Of course,her writing is fun as always with a good ear fordialogue between her characters. The students(the suspects) in Jane and Shelly's botany classare interesting and entertaining as are the quipsbetween the two lead characters. What missing here,however, is the mystery. One character is injured atthe beginning, but the actual murder occurs so late inthe novel that is feels like an afterthought. Oncethe murderer is uncovered a few pages later, it seemslike a cheat because there is little in clues to guessthe identity of the killer and the motive is a weak one.Churchill always writes a good yarn and never failsto entertain, but this time ""mulch"" is missing fromthe actual crime."
2,Definitely Not Her Best Work...,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I wouldn't miss a Jane Jeffry mystery novel, but this is something that even a fan like myself can pass on. This book is lacking in plot and concentrates too much on the gardening. The mystery is mentioned in the beginning, and seems to falter off as the story slowly wears on. With a few mentions every twenty pages or so, the mystery seems to be forgotten. Suddenly, the reader is hit in the face with the solution and the killer. It comes to an almost abrupt end, and is definitely not Jill Churchill's best work."
3,Not enough red herrings in this one,"As usual, Jill Churchill pens an enjoyable novel with lots of entertaining dialogue between Jane Jeffrey and her neighbor Shelley. The plot is a simple one. Jane and Shelley decide to improve their gardening skills by taking a botany class. Before the class starts, the instructor is beaten and ends up in the hospital with amnesia about the event. She is replaced by a stodgy old fellow who manages to bore all of the participants with his overly-detailed lectures. When he encounters an untimely end, Jane and Shelley decide that there is a connection. Their suspects include all of the eccentric people in their class. There is very little intrigue in this one, and the false leads that make mysteries so much fun, are missing. This book is fun, and I wouldn't miss one of the Jane Jeffrey books, but it is definitely lacking in plot and suspense."
3,Pleasant and Entertaining,"While this isn't the best of the Jane Jeffry series, it is still entertaining and worth reading. It is summer and Jane and Shelly decide to take a gardening course at the local community center, unfortunately, the instructor is attacked and left in a coma. More of the standard mayhem follows. Formulaic, but enjoyable."
3,"Good Book, but more to do with other Various Scientists","Stephen Hawking's Universe is a book that attempts to explain Stephen Hawking's theories of how the universe was created. Under Stephen's theories he supports the Big Bang. In the Big Bang theory it states that the universe was created by a big explosion. Aside from explaining the Big Bang theory, the book also talks a little about Hawking's personal life before he developed Lou Gehrig’s syndrome which has paralyzed him for life.Although the book talks about Stephen Hawking's Work, it mentionsvery little. The book focuses mostly on the history of cosmology and various other cosmologists who have attempted to find the beginnings to the universe. If you are looking for a book that describes in depth Hawking's work and his theories, then this is not the right book."
3,Brief Explanations and Pretty Pictures,"I have no doubt that Stephen Hawking is a genius. I also have no doubt that he knows what he is talking about. However, given the reputation that precedes him, I was not terribly impressed with the explanations found in this book. I suppose given the fact that the book was meant to compliment the television series, I should not expect too much explanatory detail. Assuming that this is the case, I would have to say that this book presents a good overview of cosmic phenomenon and includes some spectacular stellar photography. But those wanting a more in-depth understanding of black holes, white dwarfs, and pulsars should probably look elsewhere."
4,Non-Fiction,"A layman accessible look at the various sciences supporting cosmology.As you can see from the author, the only actual Hawking here is the beginning, but his work is referenced at various stages throughout.A pretty interesting and decent looking book, but obviously out of date pictorially, now"
5,OK without the tv series but great with it,For this book you need to have seen the television series but if you the book won't be as good. However since I have then it was a great book.
5,Cliff's Notes on the Universe,"This simply written book is a delightful introduction to the the universe and the history of cosmology. Written for non-scientists, it gives the reader a basic understanding of what scientists know and don't know about the universe, its origins and composition. From quasars to black holes to quarks and string theory, the book gives the uninitiated an unusually clear interpretation of the often baffling language of physics and astronomy. Great pictures, too."
3,Great beginners book.,"Editors note:- I have a previous review which I would like to change for the following... * If this contravene's your rules just leave it out.As noted by another reviewer, this book was written by a journalist and uses Hawking's name for promotional purposes. It is a great book for an introduction to relativity for begginers but if you are well versed and are looking for some new idea's then look elsewhere.* For an example see Http//www.i-o.net.au/members/norileah/ I have started an on going home page dealing with relativity.Readers comments are welcome..."
4,Great race tire,Grippy and much more puncture resistant than other light race tubulars I've used. I usually have to change these when they've worn down to the casing. Only complaint is that they're a challenge to mount the first time.
4,First Inspection,Haven't installed or riden tires yet - it is winter here! Will comment more next spring but seem like a good product thus far.
1,Emmbroided Mesh Bustier,"when this arrived I was disappointed on sight. It is not made very well, the material is itchy and uncomfortable . When I washed it, it fell apart. I would not recommend this to anyone. I felt it was pricey enough to be of good value, but I did not like anything about it. Even my hubby commented that I have many others that he liked so much better. The color of this was the ONLY thing that was good about it."
1,"Noise, the demise of Lengsel","I liked the first album Solace alot, but this one rubs me the wrong way. I hated every track on here. To me it's just noise, better than other noise bands, but still noise. I wouldn't even call this stuff metal. I'm sure some who like the first release will still like this, it is weird and somewhat unique sounding, but for me it's just creative noise. The members of this band also managed to aid in making Extol lame as well, Extol became lame after Undeceived and got worse with each release. You could probably even consider The Kiss, the Hope a screamo album, it's certainly lousy enough to qualify. I advise anyone who liked the first album to listen to this one before buying it first, you may be disappointed and it always sucks wasting money on a dud album (such as this). To sum it up, this album sounds like 3 talented guys got high on multiple drugs and recorded the jam session. Boring............"
3,Mrs Warren's Professional daughter,The play Mrs Warren's Profession was one of Shaws plays unpleasent and he wrote it at a time when many people shyed away from the mojority of political and social issues of the time. Shaw had an ability however to lay down the facts of many things that were happening in society and he often gave the reader or audience a sense of responsibilty that many of the people involved were receiving. In Mrs Warren's Profession he focusses on the hidden world of prostitution without ever mentioning the word or even spelling it out to the reader/audience. With this he is able to descibe the effects it has without crudly embarking on a course of discrimination. All in all it is a powerful piece which shows how women had had influence over the world in all aspects.
2,So-so,"As other reviewers have said, the secondary characters are better developed and mean more to the reader than the two main characters. I found myself more interested in the story of Estelline and Ruth than Dani and Grace.The writing style is also average. It doesn't take much thought to read this, but I guess sometimes you're in the mood for that."
2,Was hoping for better,"The story seemed promising. The writing seemed decent if not outstanding. The characters had potential. But something went wrong.The characters turned out to be wooden and never developed beyond the surface. After awhile, the dialogue became boring and trite. The story meanders on with frequent pointless details.Maybe my expectations were just too high."
5,Reads Like a folk Classic,"I LOVED this tale. My daughter enjoyed it, too. Set in ancient Japan, the story unfolds like a centuries old folk tale that has been lovingly passed down through the generations. What a surpise to discover it is new and original to the author. ""The Long Silk Strand"" represents the life of an old woman as recounted to her granddaughter, a different tale for each silk thread wound into a ball. When the ball is complete, the grandmother dies, and her loving granddaughter goes in search of her in heaven. But the living and her life ahead call her home again. The story is beautiful and simple, its rich texture wonderfully rendered in the illustrations. I can well imagine this tale told by a storyteller in a candle-lit room -- how lovely to find it in a modern book."
3,Decent swing.,"Sometimes using this swing was the only way we could get our son to sleep. This one plugs in so you don't go through a bunch of batteries. Also it has a small footprint so you won't be wasting valuable floor space. Would be nice if it swung from side to side. Babies tend to prefer that motion. TheFisher-Price Baby Papasan Cradle Swing version has that motion, but is more expensive and takes up a ton of space."
1,Great swing...if you WANT your baby to get a head injury,"I bought this for my son when he was about a month old. When he reached about 15 pounds, the swing kept stopping swinging...I returned twice andboth replacements had the same problem. I used it anyway, even though it would often stop swinging, and when my son was old enough to move his head and lean over, his head banged on the metal railing holding the swing. I called Fisher Price and I am shocked to see that they have not recalled this product, it is downright dangerous!"
1,What age is it good for?,"In the product description, I don't see what baby age this swing is appropriate for. How much weight does it support? How tall can the baby be to fit? One star."
4,great swing for the price,"Having the option to plug in the AC power cord is a great option. So many devices take batteries, it's expensive and bad for the environment. The AC also charges an internal rechargeable battery so you have the option of running the unit on DC if not near a power source. Lacks the option to recline seat and no head support for wobbly new born heads. Rolling up blankets and placing on each side of the head aids in support and having the child sit on a blanket keeps him higher so that his head stays back and his chin does not end up in his chest. Improvement needed here from Fisher. Nice option that mobile animals swing out of the way when entering and exiting the child, would be nice if mobile would go a little lower, small children are oblivious that it's there."
3,its ok,overall i love this swing but my son is 16lbs and if i put him in there with a blanket on his legs it slows way down i put it on the highest setting anything else and it hardly moves. the volume is very loud or so low you can hardly hear it. and the three seat positions are not that great it dosnt go back far enuff and the mobile is kinda outa sight with the way the seat reclines but other than that i love it and not having to buy batteries is great
2,Didn't Last Long,"I bought this becuase it seemed to be everything I wanted. Great price, multi-speed, the ability to plug into an outlet. Unfortunately, its ability to swing began degrading after the first week, and now barely moves (its been in use periodically for a about 1 month). I will say it did put her to sleep pretty well, but her head would flop over (I also didnt realize it reclined until reading these reviews... which is not the swings fault). Anyway, I'm returning the swing to Target fior a refund since it no longer swings. May look into a graco or the FisherPrice 3 stage swing."
5,Love this swing,"I love having a swing I can plug in. We haven't even used batteries in the swing yet. I like that the mobile swings out of the way and the storage nets on the sides of the swing are very helpful. I also love the size of this swing. It is smaller than any of the swings we looked at before we found this. I love that this swing reclines in 3 different angles (recline feature in the back) so we can use it for all of baby's stages. The only things I would change would be to add a head support for newborns, and the slowest speed seemed a little fast for a newborn, but as she grows and weighs more, it won't be a problem."
3,Pretty Good,"I got it as a baby shower gift, and mainly liked it since it can plug into the wall. My son is only a month old right now, but he doesn't really like to nap in it. It's good when I need to get something done though, because he likes to be constantly held by me. And I tend to make the swing go a bit faster by just helping it along abit then it keeps that speed going. But it's fine for what I need right now.ETA: 3 years later. The musical part broke within 6 months. I forgot that I wrote a review. I wanted to add this in for people to know it may break."
4,"Great Function, Okay Looks","The songs are nice. I'm glad there is volume control. And I am over the moon that it doesn't require batteries! I've used it with two babies now, and it was a winner with both. Just wish it has more attractive to the adult eye. But the kids seemed fine with it."
3,Cute Idea but frustratingly disappointing,"This is a very cute set-up, but very soon into the book conversations and information was regurgitated again and again and again to make sure I understood what the problems were between them. I love relationship stories; I don't care if the plot/conflict is weak, but the writer hit me over the head with this one so many times, she must think I'm brainless. It would've made a great ""short"" romance, but at this stretched-out length, I couldn't finish it. I'm sure her other tales are better."
2,"Doesn't look like a printed book, but a b/w photocopy","I bought this Bible for an elderly person that can't read english, so I was very excited about the book. It took around 10 days to arrive. When I opened the box I realized that is not a regular printed book, is more like a photocopy (not very good quality) from an old Book, so is little bit hard to read, even more for an elderly one. I bought it from Barnes & Noble, when I went to the store to return it, they told me that they can't refund my money in Store, so I had to sent it again via UPS (B&N paid for the Shipping), and wait more time to get the money back, so it was a very long time for a book that was not really useful for the person that need it."
5,He was shot!,I guess I saw the original version too. Jock was accidentally shot at the end. Hard to watch. Kinda like Old Yeller.
3,Beware - not the original Jock of the Bushveld,"I am a South African and very dissapointed that 2 whole scenes were just cut out of this movie, possibly to make it ""politically correct"". Though the scenes are disturbing it is part of the movie and must be seen in that light. Please warn your buyers that they are buying a watered down movie and not the original."
1,Jock,"most disappointing. bought this movie thinking it was the original ""Jock of the Bushveld"" but instead got an absolute botch up. editing was probably done by a 2 year old. this movie is a mockery of the orignal and the book. don't make the same mistake I did and get this movie thinking it was ""jock of the Bushveld"" African version. Just shows how mainstream movie makers think that by throwing in a big name actor (Robert Urich) they'll make it better than the original. In my opinion the original vs. this movie are not even in the same league."
1,"The horror, the horror of bad remakes!!!!","Gray Hofmeyr's 1986 version of this film was true to the book and gave your hearts some major tugs, especially at the end of the film when Jock dies. In this one, the only bright light is the late Robert Urich, who endeared himself to everyone here when he arrived to shoot his scenes.An awful film (with a wimpy hero and an even more wimpish heroine, the actress playing the role of Lilian complained that ""South Africa is so dusty, I'm glad I don't lay bricks when I go to the toilet"") one that should be missed by all.[...]"
1,Dissappointed!,"I too was really dissappointed in the remake of this film, I honestly thought I was buying the original I saw in South Africa as a child. The whole film just seems so unenthusiastic, even the ending is not as it was in the book or original film. Alot of the scenes do not match the book as the original film did. Im sending the film back as I am now purchasing the original from ebay. what a waste of time and money!"
1,Made in China,"Why gamble with your dog's health? These are made in China.Since Chinese manufacturers have proven that they don't care if they make Chinese children sick and die,why would they care about American dogs??I wouldn't have checked even ONE star but this review would not postuntil I checked one.Check out Nature's Variety Brand products instead."
4,Chicken Jerky in a Jar,My three dogs enjoyed the treats. The plastic jar kept the mess to a minimum. What else can I say?
4,Nice book.,"Although this is not an exhaustive academic study of the Declaration, this is a very useful and informative book. There are many illustrations and other props included that add to the literary content. When I bought this book the intent was to use it as a coffee table book that folks could pick up when they come to visit. It serves that purpose well, but I believe that it could also be an interesting book for an adolescent who is very interested in American history."
2,Missleading,"Did not call out the width and the picture is missleading, product is only 1"" thk. Should give dimensions was not able to use product."
2,Kinda bummed.,"We've had this stand for 3 years & have always enjoyed our hammock, but yesterday we went to use it & the wood snapped in half right at the metal connector right as my husband sat down in it. As if it wasn't bad enough that our awesome hammock broke, the beam smacked him in the shoulder when it snapped.It was all very sudden & unexpected. For such an expensive hammock - especially one that claims it is ""long lasting"" - we were quite disappointed."
5,Content Description,"These delightfully animated myths and legends from many times and places not only promote an interest in literature, but teach valuable social values as well. Designed for ages 3 & up. Features Bill Cosby and Vincent Price."
4,Great live set,Great live set. Not quite as good as Gratitude (a very tough standard to go by) but better than live in 75. The horns go wild on this. Shows what great musicians these guys were. Great energy and a definite add to the collection.
2,EWF - Live in Rio,"I am a huge EWF fan and have been as far back as I can remember, but I was somewhat disappointed in this album. The sound quality is not very good, and it just seems too loud. Like all you can hear is the crowd screaming and not the music and lyrics.It has great songs on it if one could just hear the music and not people screaming and clapping."
4,Soul Surprise,"I had never heard of this group until I saw it on my Amazon ""recommended"" list recently. I love 70s soul music, so I was intrigued enough to order this one without hearing anything first. I'm very glad that I did, and pleased very much with the music on here. Supremely silky soul sounds; strong songs and good harmonies. It's the total package. I'm just blown away that I missed out on this band back when they were recording. If you like 70s soul groups like the Spinners, Blue Magic, and the Stylistics, this might be up your alley too. I liked this album so much that I ordered another one by this group too. A shame they aren't better known."
4,A great group few heard of at the time,"Ace Specrtum only put out three albums, but they were all good. It's hard to say which one is the best, but this one has some really good stuff on it.I was not impressed with their cover of ""Laughter in the Rain,"" on the Low Rent Rendevous CD, but they did a really good job with ""Don't Let Me Be loney Tonight"" on this album. This album definitely has a Philly Soul sound to it, as do the others (though Just Like in the Movies has more of a disco/late 70s element to it). So if you like that kind of music, then you should give Ace Spectrum a try."
4,"An adorable story, with the very lovable Frances","This book in the Frances series tells of Frances' trouble with having to share her parents with her new baby sister. In typical Frances style, she makes up songs about what she is doing, and complains loudly about things that she doesn't like. Her decision to run away to under the dining room table was a running joke in our family for months. Now if someone's nose gets bent out of shape we say ""are you going to run away to under the dining room table?""It handles the needs of older siblings and their feelings very nicely and is a great ice breaker to help older kids talk about how a new baby impacts their lives."
4,Baby Sister for Francis,"I bought this book for my 5 year old grandson who just had a baby sister. His baby sister had not been brought home from the hospital yet when I gave him the book. He likes the other Francis books, but seems mystified by this one. It may be that Francis is having some disappointments because of having a sense of being left out because of her baby sister - I think he cannot relate to that. I recommend giving this to a child who may already be experiencing some of the difficulties Francis is. It is a delightful book that I think my grandson may come to enjoy as much as he does the other Francis books - but later in his new brother-sister relationship."
4,"Back to TRUE stories, feelings, music...","The music from movie ""Mrs. Henderson presents"" will bring you to the mystical world of music shelter, where people kept their souls during the terrible world war.Pure voices, talanted retro music, unforgettable lyrics...Just lysten to Will Young singing ""All the things you are"" and you'll fall in love with this album."
4,"Works well, but poor software OCR","The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is the poor quality of the OCR software...it just flat out works poorly. On top of that, the pen only includes the light version of the software - and then nags you to upgrade. That said, I only wanted this device to save handwritten notes, so I can go back to a certain day and look at my notes for that day. So for what I wanted, this works flawlessly. For those who complain about it not picking up handwriting, my suggestion would be to read the manual. You do have to setup correctly the orientation of the device so that it works properly and when attaching to a new sheet of paper, you have have to move the device a bit to get the orientation just write, but other than that it works great. I get the power of a REAL laptop, and most of the functionality of a tablet PC."
3,Poor accuracy,I purchased this item to sketch physics graphs. This product is not accurate enough for this purpose.Intersecting lines on the paper do not intersect on the computer image. They are about 1 mm off.
2,Script Recognitioon,The script recognition program did not recognize me handwriting. As a result I had to edit most of what got picked up. So I returned it for a refund. Was a great idea though.
2,Sent it back,"All the pen allows you to do is write notes on their software and use it as a mouse; if you want to convert it to text, you have to buy their premium software. The pen works quite well, but odds are it won't provide you with all the functionality you want unless you dump more money on it. The mouse works, but I can't imagine using it on a regular basis. I quickly found myself missing both the mouse-wheel and the right mouse button. I can't recommend it."
1,beware software bait and switch,"the radio signaled pen never work well and also locked you to the PC.included penscript software is a lite version with limited function--no correction option and very inaccurate recognition with 50% mistake in changing handwriting to text. Upgrade to full version costs around $30 which is 1/2 price of the cost of pen!!the pen tip can easily get stuck.Here is my main objection, why get a digital pen when it requires the users to tie to the PC?"
4,fun toy,my two year old loves to draw and watch me draw and this product was well worth the money. it keeps her busy in the car too.
4,Good Buy,"My daughter is almost 2 and played with one of these in a doctor's office with a little boy. She loved it so much, I got her one and she plays with it a lot. She likes to also watch us draw things on it and experiment with the different stamps and stylus. It's handy if you're traveling, as there is no mess to worry about in the car."
1,Where do I start?,"Let's start with Shateh, can he make a decision? Killing babies goes with being shaman and chief, don't get me wrong, he is about the most honorable character, despite putting his sons out of the tribe for not being brave enough, at five years old! Poor Warakan is so confused, so is Cha-kwena (he never wanted to be a shaman) and his Mah-ree can she ever please anyone? I feel sympathy for Ban-ya, her whole life generally [is not good]. I don't recommend reading any of this series, starting with The Sacred Stones, because you will have to know what else happens and you will end up speed reading (or skimming,in my case) to an unfulfilling ending only to find there is another and another and another book in the series! I recommend reading Beyond the Sea of Ice through to Walkers of the Wind and STOP. Nothing gets better than Torka and Lonit."
3,Sarabande,"I got through the first two books of The First Americans Series. Ordered them for a friend. She read five and they got more gruesome in each book. I quit after 2 and few chapters of the 3rd book. I kept hoping they would become less cruel, but that was not the case. I think Sarabande might have some issuess he needs to deal with. Not reading his stuff anymore."
5,something different AND great,"i picked up this cd at an independent bookstore and am sooo thrilled i bought it. it is different than most music we hear today, and that will turn some people off - but having recently listened to ani difranco (a great female musician) a hell of a lot, my ears and mind were very open. i got hooked on this cd in about 2 listens! it is so much fun, and you can sing a long, and i can imagine how great live Ember must be. her words are very sincere and the music is unique and just beautiful. unfortunately i lost this cd, but i am going to just buy it again. sorry this review isnt more detailed, but like i said, i lost the cd so i can't give the review it deserves right now!"
1,Real Eyeballs,"Ember Swift's songwriting left me cold. While I like her politics such as on ""H2O,"" the songs sound like they were improvised more than written. She tries to stick in lots of words as on ""Disarming,"" ""I like those who crave to engage, strip down, who don't fuss with protective real conversations, with real eyeballs, no smoke screens."" Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of musicality to back it up other than the rat-a-tat of the rhythm guitar bursts. As a vocalist, she has a strong voice. Her band is pretty good. However, there isn't one track on the disc I want to hear again. Taxi!"
5,Let's Party!,"What a fun album! It is the perfect background music for a summer party. Both discs are strong all the way through. It even includes one of my all time favorite songs ""Me & Mrs Jones"". What a great value."
2,Nothing Special,Disappointment. These songs are on just about any CD collection. Where is all the really good 70's soul hiding? Don't bother buying this one.
5,Incredible Soul Collection,"If you enjoy Soul music, this is a great collection of songs! (That is if you don't already own the ""greatest hits"" collections of the Temptations, Ben E King, Aretha Franklin, etc.) However, even if you do own those collections, this set is still a worthwhile buy, as I haven't seen CDs sold for some of the artists, in this collection."
2,spode plate,"Whereas spode might be collectible, the size of this dish is rather useless since most challahs are larger than this particular plate. I received this as a gift and am returning it for something more useful."
4,Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs Kit,"this was purchased as a new method of training both puppy and adult dogs I have as petsGood all around purchase.I have a 13 year old son, and this is a great kit for us to work together with for our dogs.The treats are well received by all the dogs. Need to get more :)"
4,"Karen Pryor, Getting started: Clicker Training for Dogs Kit",My granddaughter had asked for this item for Christmas. She is a big animal lover and wanted to find out about training her dog.
4,Helping clicker training,You don't have to reinvent the wheel. This will help you train with theclicker. Material is well thought out. Dog and master are training each other.
2,Not impressed,The clicker type training didn't work nearly as well as just giving a treat at the time of obedience.
2,I thought I already knew this,"This is a cute idea that has gone terribly wrong. You are told how to use a clicker to train a dog, ...and then you have to train them again with the words. It takes twice as long to teach them a trick with the clicker as it does to just use a hand motion or word to teach them. The ""tricks"" taught are, ""Here girl, Hide and seek (how easy is that?) Gimme five....(come on), Fun with a box (put your dog in a box) Find the Keys, sit and down (okay, there's one majorly lengthy idea that could be accomplished by pushing their butt down)...need I say more? If you want to pay a large price, plus shipping to learn how to teach your dog to sit down, this is the book for you. Otherwise, look farther. Not impressed."
2,"Outdated, black and white photos, overpriced","Cover looks great, has some good info but if you like pictures they are mostly poor quality black and white. Older book, about 15 years, so no mention of late model motors. To pricy for what you get."
2,Great for those with low expectations,"I put this disc in expecting big things because of all the hype it's gotten and because it has the same director who did the Ghost in the Shell series, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, I had to take it out 15 minutes into it.The animation is decent by today's standards, not Ghost in the Shell quality, but passable. The storyline is what turned me off. Unfocused and at times silly. I expected a story on par with the Ghost in the Shell series and I was disappointed that this disc fell flat. IMO, save your money. Anime is dead. Where have all the good directors gone?"
4,POWERFUL,YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!I'm not sure why others did.you have to see this movie all the way thru.
5,NICE,NICE TO SEE IT WAS OK.I REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING THIS SHOW. CANT WAIT TO SEE THE NEXT ONE IF THERE IS ANY
4,Nice.,"The ending could had been better because it just didn't touch me right. Overall, it was sweet and a good movie to watch.The ending could had been better because it just didn't touch me right. Overall, it was sweet and a good movie to watch."
4,Has some of the answers we need,"The net surrounding Saki and her group is closing in. The identity of Mr. Outside is revealed, and so is the secret behind Akira's memory. The series left many questions and this movie answers many. All the great things about the series are represented in this anime too. If you're a fan of Eden of the East, then Paradise Lost is a good movie for you to watch."
3,More Eden of the East,"This is currently the last foray into Eden of the East. The series is great. The previous movie, The King of Eden, was a nice follow-up. This last movie was a disappointment. I hate ambiguous endings. I had a feeling, from the title, it wasn't going to be ""happily ever after"" - and it wasn't. Of couse, that just leaves them open for more follow-up movies. If one comes out, you can be sure I won't miss it. Sigh........"
1,Traumatized by it's hateful statements about men,"In the supposedly liberal Bay Area, only an hour from San Francisco, I could not find a single book about male homosexuality at a time when I was questioning my sexual orientation. I bought this book figuring it would be a good source of some knowledge. Was I in for a shock. It describes that women ""as sexual beings are by far superior,"" because of how multi-orgasmic, and more errogenous they are. That the male orgasm is a pitiful 5-second experience that renders him exhausted. That the French call this exhaustion the little death. Almost every gay man I met has said that although he is gay, he has had positive sexual experiences with a woman. Although, I am gay I have always wanted to have a pleasurable sexual experience with a woman. I will never have a positive sexual encounter with a woman because of this book. Surely there must be a better book on sex out there."
4,Excellent read!,"The Penn Central was the failed attempt at combining the storied Pennsylvania Railroad and the historic New York Central Railroad -- both major lines in the Northeast United States -- during a period of time in which all railroads were suffering under strict and burdensome government regulation and the obligation to carry passenger traffic. The wreck of the Penn Central led to Conrail, Amtrak, and, in many ways, the railroad industry we have today. This book is an insightful, on the ground view of the creation and destruction of the company. Very readable for railroad historian, business historian, or simply by one who enjoys a good read."
5,Fantastic,"A wonderful book that tells in detail the disaster that was the Penn Central. A must for those studying Labor Economics, Labor Law, or Railroads in general."
3,Basic Training,"Ed Bott provides a clear and concise easy-to-read snapshot of Windows XP. The book is geared toward more of an advanced user. But it is not; it is completely a beginners manual. If you own Windows XP Inside and Out you do not need to spend money on this book. I am a strict critic when it comes to reviews so sorry Ed this only gets three stars though this review might be a little late. Some of the content material (I say some) I could not understand why it was located near the beginning of the book. I won't belabor that point but there was one point in the book, and because I am a techie, I cannot help but notice the language concerning a simple driver was poorly laid out. I do recommend this book, however, it is a basic and beginners guide. If you have a good grasp of the Windows desktop you don't need this book. There is nothing technical in it. It's an easy read."
1,Two batteries stopped working within one month.,Don't purchase as they didn't work in my cordless phone for more than a month.But company did refund me.
4,WOW!,"Amazing footage on and off stage with RockStar: INXS' runner-upMARTY CASEY & LOVEHAMMERS. This band has something no oneelse in the business can measure up to; besides extreme talent,they posses a chemistry that cannot be denied! In an industry filledwith one hit wonders... these guys have more songs under their belt(perhaps why Marty wears two ;-) LOVEHAMMERS have a fan baselike no other... So, don't miss out viewing history in the making!!"
2,Not a good crossfire board,"The layout of this board is horrible.The largest issue with this board is SATA placement. All four internal SATA connectors are right under the second PCIex16 slot. If you're running crossfire with a full-sized card and sata drives, be prepared for a nightmare. It's impossible to attach 4 sata drives without issues. I've yet to get a ""problem free"" layout.Add in the fact that the floppy connector requires you to WRAP the fdd cable around the second video card causes more problems."
4,It is a good motherboard.,"This motherboard is simple but good, it does not have many accessories but it works superbly well, if you search for something simple but good, this is what you need."
1,Extended Warranty,"I purchased a WACCA warranty and discovered it would not be of value for the item I purchesed.They have a 30 day refund policy.I have spent most of the 30 days receiving ""You will hear from us in two days.""My review is to carefully consider ANY extended service or extended warranty policy but don't expect WACCA to respond.They can have the $24 because it is more effort to get the refund they guarantee."
1,Error Board,This thing is the cause of nonstop trouble for me. If you plan on running a 64 bit machine get a different mobo. The audio drivers for the integrated sound card don't work for a lot of people. Spend a little more and get a nicer board. I'm going to fill out my second RMA for this piece of junk.
1,Goode's,"Awful I will not put a star at all, I order the book for mine GEO class, I order August 28, I pay 6.99$ for express delivered, today is Sep 12 I do not have any idea where my book is because is not tracking number for me to see, I will never again will buy from them, I have 3 weeks already in Geo class and it will be over in 3 more weeks...............SO MAD"
1,Without Motive (or Talent),"Not very good. Ross Kemp was good in Eastenders, but he has a very limited range -- glowering and rage, and very little else. I'd skip this one."
5,Awesome band,"Number One Gun is an awesome christian band putting out good music, good mixture of upbeat emo and slower emo. Buy their cd, tell your friends about them, they are awesome. Good stuff."
2,I'm really not sure why this was in the video store at all...,"I was hoping that a plot line might save the obviously low-budget quality of this movie, but the plot was weak, far too coincidental, and just cheap all-together. It's like somone wanted to make a movie about a threesome... so they could talk about it throughout the movie for a while. Sorry--that cannot possibly be entertaining for two hours. Granted, it did have it's funny moments, but it's definitely a guy-flick, since they paid more attention to how the actors looked than whether or not they can act.I must admit, the ending was cute, but the movie consisted of far too many Kevin Smith movie references (Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) that were way too obvious. If anything, this is a poorly put together homage to Kevin Smith's movies."
2,Its ok for a few laughs not much tho,Wasnt all that good. Some scenes are ok but over all crap Being uncensored it was really crap do not get unless its under a buck
1,Leave the cue on the rack,"Movies which divide opinion attract my interest so I gave it a try. I can say I watched it all the way through, which is something, as I have little patience or hesitation in dumping a bad movie after five or ten minutes. Was it the acting, plot, interest in character development? No, none of these. And it wasn't for any of the actors' visual appeal.It is not even really a pool movie. Despite most of the story happening inside a pool shop, the actors didn't seem very comfortable with pool cues. Perhaps I saw it through (once) just for the sense that the film's makers were trying to be original and do something a little daring or different. Some of the incidental characters brought amusing moments.A small niche of `B' grade movie watchers might find something of value here."
2,Kisses and Caroms,"I think this movie had a production budget of $1.98. Maybe I over-stated it. The movie was done as well as can be expected for what it is, but what it is, is short of expectations."
5,Best movie ever,"I have four words for you, ""You're gonna love this film"". I've watched it a dozen times and every friend I show this film to loves it as well. Many of my friends swore to buy their own copy ASAP. This is a must own!"
3,where are the directions?,I'm not sure what we think of the hammock yet since it is in 15 pieces with no sign of instructions on how to put it together. Come on now...this is basic. Payley's Island could at least supply a diagram!
1,Rotting,I have had the hammock and swing stand for 2 years and they both collapsed due to the wood rotting. Fortunately no one was hurt but the company was totally unsympathetic and offered to sell me new parts at retail. Very poor product and support. Pretty but dangerous.
1,Don't Do It !!!,"I own this product. Received it as a house warming gift.I has totally rotted and fallen apart.Contact with the manufacturer indicated ""It has a one year warranty"".Good luck in year 2 if you decide to buy it!!!"
5,Soak up the breeze in the hammock!,"I recently purchased this item, and I love it! It was easy to assemble, and so comfortable to lie in. I set it up in my backyard where I have a view of the ocean. I go back there often to read a book, listen to music or just to take a nap. I've spent hours in this thing in the past few weeks, and I plan to spend many more.If you want to create your own little tropical paradise, buy this hammock!"
4,Good but not great,"This book has a lots articles of different genres that talk about pop culture. Personally, I found all these articles very helpful in the way that they require much of mental thinking to deeply comprehend what the author tries to say. With that being said, some authors has very abstruse style of writing that slows down your comprehension unless you read it over several times. If you are someone who seeks some pop cultures books for reading pleasure, this book is not for you, but those who read it for academics this book is definitely the one. It helps so much when you discuss the article with your friends; some new insights will be gained during the discussion.Overall, it should be best if each article has side notes or something that summarizes the main ideas of the article. I give this book four stars because it is a good book but needs small adjustments."
3,Discovering Popular Culture,"So I bought this book as a textbook for a class. It's not the type of book I read on my own. If this is the sort of thing you like to read about I would recommend it, it has a few interesting articles, but I didn't feel there was anything really incredible. A great book to look into if you're into studying culture."
4,Does What Has To,Haven't any problems yet...good option for a S-video cable. No need to spend more money than you have to when this cable is available.
3,S-Vid cable,First set of cables were the wrong ones. (camera to usb) Getting a hold of customer service was a joke. The number on the web site just disconnected you. Did my own internet search for another phone number and after numerous attempts finally got a hold of a person. Had to explain the problem multiple times before she understood the problem. Finally got the correct cables another 10 ten days later. The cables work fine.
4,EYE OPENING HAYDN!,"There is something very special about those old Hanover Band recordings on the Nimbus label(late 80's/early 90's) and this is another one of those fine examples. Great symphonies, a nice performance and the sound is just wonderful in that Nimbus way.Enjoy!"
5,Excellent to the extreme,"One of my all-time favorites--both the movie, soundtrack and novel. Well-written. One of the best things to come out of Jamaica!!"
1,awful,"I'm a huge Barbara Wood fan, but this novel is awful. It's so repetitive! It's a creepy, almost incestuous story. Choose from her MANY other terrific books; skip this one!"
2,"Love Barbara Wood, didn't love this book","I've read just about every Barbara Wood novel and am a real Wood fan but this book was a disappointment. I agree with the reviewer who said that Virgins of Paradise is a beautiful work and Yesterday's Child isn't up to the author's usual standards.I kept reading, hoping that the book would reel me in but it just didn't! I would pass on this one and choose any of Ms. Wood's other novels."
4,Very nice ear candy!,"This CD is very well done. It has an extremely mature and professional feel to it. It is relaxing and tranquil from beginning to end. My favorite cut is track 3 ""Tyrian"". I look forward to hearing more music from this terrific artist! Brannan Lane, Nashville,TN"
4,"Pretty cool, but...","All I have to say is that this guide is excellent, it reveals a lot of secrets and has pretty good and detailed maps. The only reason why I didn't give it all 5 stars is because a lot of pictures were in the wrong place. Great guide for a great game."
1,Worst guide I've ever seen,"This guide was the worst piece of crap I've ever bought. For one, almost every single picture in the whole guide was in the wrong place. It also left a lot of unanswered questions. One is why the kaiser dragon is a piece of crap."
4,Could've been better though...,"It didn't help me very much, but that may be coz I'm the best B of F-player ever known to humans..... So long buddies! ""Tifa"""
3,Few Problems With BOFIII Guide,In the guide there was a great amount of mistakes. But even with them it still included all the necessary information.
4,This is a good book if your a begainer.,"this book shows a lot of secerts, but it leaves something to be desarred about the maps. There kind of hard to follow. But over all this is a realy good s.g."
3,ehhh,"I bought this awhile back and yeah..it came with fast deliver in a USPS package and was neatly folded...but when you actually get this pants the colors look faded which was not expected...friends says that its fake also.So nothing much is lost, my fault for not getting the right one i guess.Thanks for your time."
5,Awesome Camera Case,"I bought this item and used it in the Cayman Islands. I took 432 pictures, 400 of those were underwater. The case didn't leak at all and the photos came out crystal clear. Highly recommended."
4,Self-Help or Group Study Text~Leadership Training,"Good study text for some insight and Leadership Training on how to become more like God wishes us to be to lead our families, churches, and influence our communities. Based on Characteristics listed in 1 Timothy 3, and Titus 1. This is part of a Video based study set that is available that includes a 3 disks of lessons and helps, an instructor's manual, Student manuals, and this text"
5,Great for Individual or Group Study,"I wasn't able to attend the group study, but followed along on my own. Simple concepts that can be applied to daily living."
5,Good value,"This radiator was a good value, but installing them is a little difficult due to the oil cooler and transmission cooler lines. This is not due to the radiator, but rather the vehicle design. I installed it about 1500 miles ago and have had no problems since. I should point out that I am not a professional mechanic and this was the first time I have installed a radiator. The fact that I had some difficulty is not surprising.I saved a lot of money doing it myself! It took me about 3 hours."
3,Like them,"But I think a little expensive for what you get. I ended up buying some other ones when it was time to refill. I originally bought these to help my 7-year old clean her braces, but ended up using them myself since they seemed to big for her."
1,Very thick. Not for tight teeth.,The circumference of this gum pick is way too wide. Unless you have huge gaps between your teeth there is no way these are going to fit in. I cannot get it to fit between any of my teeth. Very wide and very disappointed. A warning to those with tight teeth. There is no way this is going to fit you. I give it zero stars.
4,Best all-round indentification guide to dolls,"This book has more information in one volume than any other doll ID guide that I've seen. I especially appreciate the doll size charts--helps to determine what size head goes on which body for many makes of antique dolls. Newer dolls are covered, too. It's my most-used book!"
3,TOO EXPENSIVE FOR TOO LITTLE,"The pamphlet is too expensive for what it has, but it gave some pinpoints the rest is up to me."
4,Informative,"This book is very informative and you MUST own it if you are considering working in a field related to forensic psychology. Many of the chapters are well written and concise. However watch out for a few portions of the book--namely Chapters 12, 13, and 14. The authors of these chapters did a terrible job--you may need additional resources to understand the concepts. But overall this book is very good and (generally-speaking) easy to understand."
5,Forensic Psych,"Book is completely fine, but took over FOUR WEEKS to ship. I was wayyy behind in the class by the time I got the book!"
4,I think this is one of the greatest books on psychology,I'm a highschool junior. This book helped me greatly on a research paper for english. I especially liked the way it described the meaning of psychology. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology.
2,"this book is supposed to be for parents, but the writing is for teens","i found this book annoying. you can tell that mr. hancock is more comfortable speaking to youth because he can't seem to write decently for adults. i found the style so distracting and, at times, condescending, i finally had to quit after chapter 3.4 (numbering the chapters with decimals doesn't make your book cool, by the way). too bad, because it seemed like he had some valid points."
3,Works for what I got it for,"This keychain works for what I got it for, which was I had more keys than would fit on my ROOTS Multi Detachable Keychain. The latter is high quality and cost about $20. This product did not break but the key rings do not go all the way around because the notch where you put in the keys gets in the way. That means to get out a middle key, you have to get out the others in the way. I keep the keys I do not use very much on this ring and the ones I use and take on and off a lot, I use with other rings (I have a lot of keys). The reason I take them on and off is that I read that weight is bad for your ignition, so I take off my car key when I use it. Also for work, I go to a variety of different offices so I add the particular office keys to my normal ring when I go to that office. If you do not want to remove your keys from the ring very often, and only want to remove one or two keys, and want to save money, this item may be for you."
1,"Looks good, stainless steel, but the latch is junk","I had high hopes for this, I have had a similar-looking keyring for my keys for years and years, and I was very excited to find this. I purchased two, one as a backup and one for my wife.I was VERY disappointed. The overall construction is very cheap and flimsy, the rings and the ball-attachments for them are not well made, and most importantly, while the central part does appear to be made of stainless steel, the spring-loaded latch on the inside has been very poorly constructed (not machined, appears to have been pressed somehow).The latch/slide on my wife's broke within two weeks. Do yourself a favor and don't bother buying this unless you like losing your keys."
3,Where's the quality?,"When I ordered this I expected the same quality as the one I was replacing. Not so. While it does what is supposed to, it's clearly not as well made. I guess I got what I paid for."
1,Broke within a month,This product is garbage. The keyring holder fell apart and was cheaply made. Do not buy if you have more then 3 keys on your chain.
2,worked for a short time ...,"First, I am hard on keyrings and pockets. I have many keys(12, of which two are car keys - so thick bases), and carry many other things in my pockets. My previous key ring has been wearing out, and I thought this would be a good replacement. It worked for a while, then the knob used to ""open"" the key ring broke off, and now there is no way to keep the seperate elements on the main ring. I will keep hunting for a better ring."
4,Got what I was looking for...,Received the product in record time and found it to be exactly what I was looking for; allows me easily organize my keys for various settings so that I don't have to carry all of them all of the time.
5,Lighten up your pocket,Unnecessary keys in my pocket? What a drag. Lighten your load with this valet key ring. Easily remove the keys you don't need. Less bulk in your pocket. Nice.
1,Fell apart in a week,"Glad I didn't spend more than a few bucks... the main spring popped out in just over a week and made the whole thing useless. Also, it took forever to arrive."
4,The most useful keychain ever,"I have been using this Chinese keyring for about 5 years. It keeps breaking and I buy another of the same model and design and continue using it. Why? Am I crazy? No. It is incredibly useful. You can leave your car running and take out the trunk key, or house key, or mailbox key without trouble.Don't expect quality or looks. This is strictly a convenience item.Buy it at or under $5 and even when it falls apart and you replace it, you will still be happy with the device."
2,I thought this was going to be so great.,"For work and home I have SO many keys and this looked like the answer to my prayers.It was great for the couple of weeks or so, but then it fell apart. It was easy to put back together, but it kept falling apart! And not from a lot of use either. I would just put my hand in my coat pocket only to find that the key ring had fallen apart again! I finally lost one of the pieces so now I've scrapped it. Back to the drawing board I guess."
3,Is there room for improvement? Yes.,"I don't quite understand why they insist in a blend of horror and comedy movie, they just don't go together!I understand a little humor at the beggining of the film,just before the action starts,but when they over do it, it just dissipates or softens the suspense,and there is when it gets corny,if it wasn't for that, believe me,it would be a a lot better.The effects are ok and maybe the story too,overall...worth watching once."
3,Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Jeepers Creepers meets Duel meets Road Trip meets . . . Abbott and Costello?,"Ok. First off, this film ain't Lord of the Rings. But if you're an Evil Dead fan, or a fan of low budget horror films in general, you'll probably enjoy it. The bottom line is Monster Man is fun. It looks like those responsible for this movie knew they were making a low-budget feature and therefore didn't take themselves too seriously. As a result, it seems like the cast was having fun during production and ultimately, the audience has fun too. Although it's not that scary, the laughs more than make up for this deficiency. There is quite a bit of gore, but you'll still find yourself laughing even through the biggest gross-outs. All I can say is, if the writer is considering a sequel -- please, please call Bruce Campbell."
3,Worth watching just because of Aimee Brooks.,"This movie was pretty good. I wouldn't consider it a horror movie since it was more like a comedy with horror elements; still it had a fair amount of blood.Two guys who can't seem to quit bickering are traveling to another state to stop a wedding. First they are stalked by a hearse then finally a ROAD WARRIOR-style monster truck that's driven by a large disfigured freak the two guys name F***face. Things brighten up though when they pick up a hot hitchhiker named Sarah, but Old' F***face stays on their trail and next thing you know the three travelers are meeting F***face's clan up close and personal.The first time I watched MONSTER MAN I really enjoyed it, but the second time around it was kind of lame. The energy and humor did not hold up well at all. Aimee Brooks was still sexy though, but sadly there is no nudity."
3,Not too Bad...,"A Lion's Gate release can't be all bad, right? Right. The acting was very good, the plot and formula different, the filming clear and not grainy. The only reason why I gave it three stars instead of four was because of the lack of action, the brunt coming towards the end, and too little of Monster Man--but enough of an ending to pack a powerful punch, nevertheless. I do recommend this movie due to the strong character development, if not anything else, and a very good ending."
4,horror comedy that works!,"Soooooo tired of lame unfunny horror comedies but this one actually delivers. Even more shockingly, saw it on ScyFy or SciFi or whatever they call themselves these days.Biggest reason--characters you can care about. Without that it doesn't matter how good your monster or special effects are or how much nudity you throw at us. Kudos to the folks behind this!"
4,Its ...far fetched FUN!,"This comedy/horror takes the best things about ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Wrong Turn"" and, ""Jeepers Creepers"" and turns them on their heads!! It blends these types of horror films and adds its on twist! The two male stars have good comedic chemistry as they embark on a road trip to a friends wedding. As they drive thru an eerie town full a people mysteriously missing arms and legs, they discover the truth of why a madman in a converted monster truck has been following them and terrorizing them. The macabre and sinister plot thickens when they pick up a beautiful young girl with a few secrets of her own. Gore fans will find plenty of blood and guts to feast their eyes upon and, also a far fetched and funny story to go with it! This on is truly not for everyone.. some will hate it from the start, some will hate the ending. I thought it was pretty good thru out, I really bought into the whole idea of the ending and just went with it!"
1,NOT FOR THE SELF RESPECTING HORROR FAN,"I really do not know where to begin. This movie is simply insulting to all who watch it, not just your self-respecting horror fans. This movie is poorly written and directed. It feels as though the director really has no clue about horror movies. This is clearly demonstrated in the fact that he ripped off so many great horror flicks, but mentions none of them in the commentary. If you are a true fan of horror movies this will be of no interest to you. If you, on the otherhand, think I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine were cinematic masterpieces then by all means rent or buy this movie. Why anyone would give this movie more than one star (if it were an option I would have given it ""0"") is beyond me. Maybe friends and relatives of the cast and crew (those poor souls). In closing, I would just like to say that if you don't have money to burn, dont' bother."
5,a diamond in the rough,"It's funny. The only reason I even picked this movie up was that a few of us were at Blockbuster and we decided to try and look for the worst movies possible. The cover and info on the back had it looking so bad all I could think of was "" Yeah, no way can this be good. "" Not only did I watch it 3 times when I rented it, I knew I NEEDED to own it.It's not so much scary but the gore,comedy, at quite possibly the best monster truck ever made make this a movie to watch. There are also a good amount of high quote-able one liners which are a staple of any good horror type movie.I'm pretty picky when it comes to movies that are worth buying. It may be low budget but that doesn't mean a movie can't be good. I've watched it about a dozen times and it honestly has just gotten funnier and is still very enjoyable to watch."
2,Poor book for students,"This book does an OK job up to about the 5th chapter. After that point, the exercises at the end of each chapter get considerably more difficult. Up until that point, the assignable problems and the sample problems in each chapter are very similar in terms of difficulty. Once chapter 5 begins, the sample problems in the text are completely useless as for deriving the differential equations necessary to solve the assignable problems. The only sample problems given in chapter 5 and beyond are real simple ""plug and chug"" type examples compared to the difficult problems at the end of the chapters. It's like showing someone how 2x4s can be nailed together and then asking someone to build a skyscraper. No fun."
1,Horrible Text,"As the prior reviewer stated, this book is awful. Saying that the book is full of typos isn't even a correct statement; saying that the book is bloated beyond belief of typos would be more correct. What's even worse, is that the same editions of the book have DIFFERENT typos. For example, my classmate would have an error in say, Fick's Law of Diffusion for One-Speed Neutrons, but my book would have the equation listed perfectly. And they would be the EXACT same edition of the book! It's ridulous. I'm honestly glad that I'm done using this book, because I never, ever want to see it again.LaMarsh killed my inner child."
3,Many Errors,"Read the book cover-to-cover. For a third edition, it has an astounding number of typos and errors - dozens per chapter - many math blunders - a few conceptual mistakes. It's fairly distracting from the material. The reader is constantly second-guessing the text - looking for the next mistake, which is never far away. There's something dysfunctional about this publishing team - to continue ignoring the huge number of errors - now into this third edition. (The 'errata' list at Prentice-Hall website is obsolete. All those have already been corrected in our copy, printed 2005. Their list says nothing about the hundreds of errors in our copy.)"
5,A must have for all nuclear students,"Very concise. I actually used this for all of my nuclear classes, from the introduction courses to the more difficult ones. The tables in the back are invaluable."
5,Perfect!!!,"I work at a popular Spa in Vagas and we play this CD and the other CD's from the Uptown Maestros at our centers. We offer Pilates as well as massage, etc. We also carry the CD's at our centers and can not keep then on the shelves. The Maestros CD's are a huge hit for us. Very hip commercial music. I have heard songs from the jazz album on the radio. Great stuff!"
1,Same River Twice,"I recieved the Cut version - 85 minutes vs. the original which is 103 minutes. The original is unforgettable, stunning scenery, fabulous whitewater, great stories. The cut version is sloppy, has no transitions between scenes, is a discredit to the original director. There is no swearing or ""adult scenarios"" in the original. I don't understand the need to ruin a wonderful movie in this way."
2,Can't find replacement bulb,"Got as a gift when we moved to the country. Have used it daily with good results until yesterday when it got dropped. Can't find a bulb, and the mfg co is in Canada. Replacing it with a name brand. Spend the extra and get a better one."
2,READ THE BOOK!,"We read the book, The Chosen, by Chaim Potok, in my 10th grade English classes. The students love the book, but the movie doesn't do it justice. It skips parts that the students most wanted to see, and doesn't come close to the moving experience of the book. The movie does provide a look at the cultural aspects of the book, including quite a few minutes of a Hasidic Jewish wedding, which is not part of the book. I would not recommend the movie, however, unless you have read the book, which is an amazingly rich literary work, first."
4,"Deeply human tale, lovingly told","On the surface this seems to be a story concerned about conflicting forms of Judaism. This is true but there's a lot more, too. There are universal themes that apply to any ethnic group: young people who are born into a strict culture but want to see more of life, conflicts between the generations, what constitutes friendship, the relationship of head to heart, the place of silence.The film achieves a nice balance, I think, between presenting the ideological concepts and the simple human events. The cast is first rate; the two fathers and the two sons are all splendid.I'm not sure why I couldn't assign five stars to the film. Maybe just because it was so male-dominated that the sparkle that comes with more interaction between the sexes was lacking. Towards the end I felt it began to drag and I was happy to see it resolved. All in all, it's a very fine film, one that most anyone would enjoy. Good for children, too although the real young ones may get antsy."
4,Prompt Service,"I was impressed with the promptness of the service, both from the seller and from Amazon. Both were quick to send e-mails with detailed information on the product as well as the estimated delivery time. I would recommend using this buyer and have already done so with many of my friends. The movie itself is a very intense, serious, and deeply moving film that deals with the differences between peoples/& or groups & the interactions (good & bad) that often occur between them."
4,Go HBO,"This is a good movie about the strengths and shortcomings of the Orthodox Jewish community. Originally an HBO movie, I'm glad they put it on DVD so that it is more archival than it's much older VHS version. Good story, great actors. The difference between two Jewish communities is outstanding."
5,Exactly the right one--finally!,"My previous attempt at purchasing this item failed as the vendor (NOT this vendor, a different one), sent the wrong size, then told me via email that I probably wasn't 'understanding the directions' which I translate as 'you're too stupid to understand how to install a toner cartridge.' This one arrive quickly, it IS the right size, and I'm happily printing away now. Rockin' good. Use these folks."
2,Old-fashioned detective,"The greatest charm of this book is seeing what was taken for granted by the characters living in NYC in the 1930s, large staff, a ""small"" apartment with only 4 bedrooms.... The puzzle itself is fairly obvious, and the set-up, Gamandge an older man married to a much younger woman who wants to please him, and his strange lab assistant, sounds more interesting than it is."
1,cornice,the cornice arrived without any end caps so there was no way to attach it to the wall so it was unuseable.
2,No Tyrant,"Buy this album only if you are a die hard Panzer ethusiast who feels he must own the set. The music on this album is much different from other releases by Jag Panzer, most notably the absense of Harry Conklin on vocals. At their best, Jag Panzer are a highly talented and inspirational power metal band, and if you are new to the camp, you'd probably be better off getting 'Age of Mastery' as a better introduction to J.P."
2,Forgettable,"Don't buy this whatever you do. Everything with Harry Conklin on vocals is awesome, and well worth the money. This has a different singer, and most of it is extremely lame."
1,What was I thinking?,I used to like this group when I was about sixteen or seventeen. I recently went back and tried to listen to it again and it's definitely one of the bands where I started wondering what I was thinking when I was listening to this.
1,Really bad. Not Caedmons Call quality at all.,"I love Caedmons Call. I thought my love for them would transfer to this CD. Boy, was I wrong. Ponderous lyrics are made more unbearable by songs with no real tune and almost no listen-ability. Stick with old Caedmons Call CDs. I recommend 40 Acres."
1,That mockingbird don't sing,"I'm not sure what these positive reviewers heard. My first impression was what in the world was he smoking? I can't even express in words how bad this album is. Even after being a long time Webb fan, I can't give this anything positive whatsoever. Every song sounds identical and the overall sound is just weird. You can download this album for free on his site. I'm glad that is what I did. I do see why he is GIVING it away though. Go buy the ""She Must and Shall Go Free"" album. It's excellent."
4,Why the voice synthesizing?,"Big fan of Derek Webb, especially his Caedmon's Call years and She Must & Shall Go Free. There are some gems on this album, but why the synthesizing of his voice? I don't remember that appearing on his previous albums. There are only a handful of songs on Mockingbird without it. To me it smacks of an artist feeling that their voice is not strong enough to stand on its own. And Webb's voice CAN. It just distracts."
2,Great message ... Lousy music!,"Bold, daring, fearless in communciating Biblical truth ... that's the spirit and power of this album. Derek's message is right on target, and needs to be heard by America's conservative Republican pseudo-Christians, who conveniently leave out any concern for the poor in their theology. Yet, the album's appeal is limited by the frankly low-quality music. The songs are poorly constructed, overly repetitive, and not helped at all by Derek's grating, hoarse voice that trails through them. I really fear the message of this album is greatly hindered by the low quality of music."
1,Amazon ripped me off,"I ordered a 3.4 ounce bottle of cologne called Aramis Life. Upon delivery I received a 1.7 ounce bottle that was empty. The box was old, worn,dented and faded ect... I just can't believe someone over there thought this was acceptable, and needless to say I'm extremely disapointed!!!"
5,"Dus is a mechaya(It's baaad,man)","I usually start this 12-tune mechaya of mostly Yiddish jazz with 'Brider Gib Mir Khotsh Eyn Daym'-and with even the slowest name that tune talent,in just a bisl time,the reaction is 'Brother,Can You Spare a Dime' in Yiddish?!'Harshl' is a real shtarker of a tune about a gangster that would've had the Purple Gang kvelling-and 'Belz' which kicks things off,reminded my tatte(my old man)about 'The Jewish Hour' radio show in Detroit,followed by Father Couglin...Oy.Someone who heard this compared Theresa to Barbra;nah man,Theresa kicks Barbra's tuchis."
4,Great tool as a design reference,"At first glance, I was disappointed. I expected the photos to be somewhat more artistic. However, after sitting down and read it, the photos are very detailed, and that's why I wanted to order this book in the first place. It contains several photos in a page that shows the different views of a flower: close up of pedals, open & close etc - which I find very useful as a design reference. However, I must say I am not very impressed with the demonstration of the teaching, how to paint or photograph a flower. I think if the author is going to enclose this part in his book, it should be in detail, or else better off just leave it."
5,i'm a playaaaaa,"This cd is a reflection of Asher's versatility whether it be a hit for the ladies or a completely made-up story concerning relationship drama. Asher possesses a natural talent with words which became apparent years ago, specifically with the track ""Situations"" on his Ezia Sed Den Dun cd. his lyrics have depth and he enjoys making people think while listening to his music. but dont you dare call him the next Eminem, he's the next Asher Roth."
1,Nick,This book is poorly researched. Its missing The Air Crew Europe Star from WW2- a puzzling omission being its the rarest of all the WW2 Stars. Colour pictures of the Ribands is not good- dont rely on these colours!. Not enough background on the medals and what the colours on the Ribands represent. No mention as to why there are only 2 WW1 stars (they were not issued after 1915 as the soldiers were all considered to be 'conscripts' and not worthy of a Star) etc. A very basic book- for raw beginners only!
5,The Cat's Point of View,This is a story about a cat and a girl who move to the city. The cat's name is Puss and the girl's name is Jenni. Puss gets lost and Jenni has to find him. The chapters alternate between Puss and Jenni's points of view. I like the fact that you can read what Puss is thinking. This is one of my favorite books that I have ever read.
5,40-30-30 Cookbook from Balance Bar Company,"This is a wonderful cookbook. Though used, it came in very good condition. For those unfamiliar with 40-30-30, it is a nutrition concept that recommends one's calories be balanced with 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 30% fat. There are lots of nice recipes in this book that call for common ingredients---not things that you have to go out searching for. They also tell you what to serve with the recipe and how much to serve per person. There is also nutrition information provided. Great book!"
3,Well....,"The book I received was in great condition, however it was not in a slipcase, and not the same as the photo. It was cheap so I'll keep it but definitely not what was advertised."
3,Hot Rod Girls and High School Caesars:,"This is an impressive collection of public domain 50s movies that fall into the Juvenile Delinquent genre: that is, low-budget drive-in pictures exploiting the post-Rock 'n' Roll teenage culture of the time. I love this stuff, so I was happy to pick up this 3-DVD package for a cheap price.One complaint: 2 of the movies don't belong on this collection at all. JAIL BAIT is Ed Wood's early 50s attempt at Film Noir, and has about as much to do with this genre as Gone With The Wind. THE GIRL IN LOVER'S LANE is more of a traditional melodrama, and also really doesn't belong here. St. Clair should have gone with movies that better fit the collection's theme, or shortened the running-time and lowered the price.All in all, though, it's worth picking up if you're a fan of all things ""J.D."" related...let's hope there's more budget movie boxes with this theme coming out!"
4,Frozen People,I'm better at appreciating the insight the book gave me into the extremely difficult life these people had in their land of hardship during this time than I am at assessing the writing itself. I believe that the writing is masterful (if not always transparant) but I know that the description of life in this land frozen out of abundance by both nature and politics will give me a lasting memory of this book.
2,Unfulfilled expectations,"I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for ""breaking in"" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks. I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be ""broken""."
4,Nice and comfy... but get dirty pretty fast,"Nice pair of slippers with great looks... I love the way they massage the feet when walking... if I had to choose one downfall, I would say they get dirty pretty quickly, and since the massaging spikes are hard to get into, it's harder to clean them... otherwise a decent pair of slippers... I'd definitely buy another pair in the future"
4,Good classic sandals,"Great versatile sandals for the price. Will never go out of style, and you can wear them almost anywhere, with almost anything."
1,de mala calidad el diseño del calzado,hola escribo para publicar que el diseño de esta sandalia es de muy mala calidad en menos 2 1 mes se rompio. Es una perdida de dinero comprar este producto. saludos.Hello I write to publish the design of this sandal is very poor quality broke about a month. It is a waste of money buying this product. bye
2,Cheap imitation!,I have had these massage sandals by a few different manufacturers ... the little nubs on these which are what massage your soles... started breaking within a few days of wearing them.. I have had some that lasted a year before breaking down... Don't buy these!
1,Good but well...,"I am way to lazy to write a full review, so heres the basics, those things on the bottom hurt, and they store dirt,, yuck!!Get nike!!"
5,excelente,excelente producto lo recomiendo es muy bueno cumplió con todas mis expectativas y el envio fue rapido seguro y confiable
2,cheap shoes,these flip flop are cheap they were ripped after a month of wear? if you want good sandals that will last for a year or more youve gotta buy leather sandals that are glued and have the soul stitched together? like these....... [...]
3,Uncomfortable at first,"The ""Massage Knobs"" hurt the bottom of my feet at first but they've worn down now so they feel better. Don't wear shoes much, just these."
2,"Nice looking sandals while new, starting to disintegrate after a month.. maybe""replicas""?","This sandals were nice looking while new, then after a month or maybe less they started to disintegrate. The little rubber things that massage your feet started to appear everywhere in the floor, the adidas logo is starting to dissapear. I would have to guess that this sandals are replicas or maybe adidas quality is not so good today. Now I need to buy another pair of sandals, but what brand?"
2,9.99 bootleg quality,I don't know about this seller but the $9.99 on amazon (which doesn't even exist right now) has terrible quality. All of those painful massage knobs bend in and fall off and maybe that's a good thing for some people but it is just a proof of poor quality and I was very dissapointed.
3,Really hard to wear,"While this is a popular type slippers, however, it is really hard to wear. Especially with bare feet. Maybe not all the people can enjoy the massage bubble."
1,Self-Torture Appliance,The single most uncomfortable zhoe product I ever bought. Hard unyielding inner sole that doesn't massage just hurts. If you've nerver wore shoes before and went barefooted all you life you might like these.
1,Santiossage Slide,Being heavy the Santiossae treatment is not at all comfortable. I would recommend a smooth sole if you weigh more than normal.
2,I really like these at first.,"I agree with ""Fargo Chowder"" (review from 2007). These were really nice at first, but they trap sweaty foot odor, and about half the nubs have fallen off. Additionally, I get little red spots on the bottom of my feet when I were these (and not with any of my other sandals), which I can only describe as little pinching of the skin."
2,Adidas flip flop slide,"Sorry, but these are the most uncomfortable shoes ever to be worn! They are like walking on needles. The plastic nodes on the sole look intimidating, are intimidating and shoes at the Dollar General are better value. This has to be the first product I ever regret buying online. :("
4,Nice shoes Year Round...,"I have owned these slip-ons over the year having bought them locally for about $25.00 a pair. They are great in the summer. I also use them as slippers at home. I'm a Bug Guy and ordinary slippers do not give my feet the support I need. So, I end up getting aching feet. With these, the aching feet are gone. Plus, the sole area against your feet make you feet feel like their getting a massage while you walk. Lastly, the velcro closure provides a snug fit. I highly recommend them."
2,meh,"Great looking and great feeling sandal. It takes awhile to get used to the massagers. Sadly, the massagers break off within a few weeks. This happened with a similar style sandal from Adidas too. I was hoping that the more expensive Santiossage would not do that. For $30, the sandals should last longer than 2 or 3 weeks."
3,"Comfortable, Not Durable","These are comfortable sandals, but they don't look new for long. The adidas logo on the sole faded off in a few weeks and the color started to fade, too."
2,Power 90 Master Series - Plyo Legs,The instructor is so irritating that I couldn't enjoy the workout. Thankfully there's an option to turn off his idle chatter and use cues only. Not sure why he has music playing because he never utilizes the beat.
1,Not a great bra,I gave it to my daughter for dress up because there is no way I'm wearing a bra that ties in the back. Not a good buy.
3,Wished it followed the TV episode more closely.,"I almost always prefer book versions to their TV counterparts, but it's not true in this case. The ""Tummy Trouble"" TV episode of Clifford is one of my daughter's favorites, so it was disappointing the get the book and discover that lots of the story had been left out, i.e. Mr. Bleakman's fence and the dogs trying to clean mud from Clifford's backyard."
2,Dumb Doggie,"Don't buy this book if you want to help a toddler cope with stomach aches brought on through no fault of his or her own. This story is about Clifford and friends pigging out and making themselves sick--probably a useful message for kids, but not particularly well done. My grandchild, 2 years old, adores Clifford, but in my opinion these books are not terribly well written. I'm sticking like honey to Pooh for life's little lessons."
4,great reading !! captures kids attention.,"My 4 yr old is like all other PBS watchers.He became an instant admirer of Clifford.I searched bookstores and they just have beginners topics like - 'Cliffords manners' or Clifford and pals' etc.He didnt like them very much.Since this book is based on an actual episode that they showed on TV,my son was even more excited to read this again and again.It has sure made him more interested in reading and i'm sure ur kids will too.But be prepared to read this to them multiple times."
4,overall - good product,"Overall, good product. The pulleys and winching mechanism are well-constructed. The instructions I thought are very deficient. Be sure you think through your position before drilling holes. The screws they give you are concrete screws - not sure how many of us have concrete garage roofs."
3,"Works great, but...","After getting this hoist installed on my garage ceiling, I've been happy with its performance. Happy enough, in fact, to buy and install a second one. But it was quite the frustrating experience installing it. My garage has a very high ceiling and is completely finished off so that the overhead studs were difficult to find. The first hoist took me about 5 hours to install. The second one took about half as long, since by then I knew what I was doing and knew where to find the studs. Overall, it's a good product and works well, but allow plenty of time for installation. One last comment: I'm still not sure why this gizmo costs over $100 because it is basically a very simple device and should probably run about $60."
3,Not Bad,"I bought the Thule 571 after I priced out building one out of scratch. I do like how the product is engineered..so I broke down and bought it.I found some of the hardware to be great...and some just crap. I replaced the pullys/rollers and the rope...and used everything else. The original stuff came apart and bent after installing. Instead, I used eye bolts and clip on industrial pullys (that I bought for about $3 bucks each)...reinstalled and I have had no problems.So...Since I had to replace a bunch of the hardware...I could not give this a great rating."
3,Thanks to Amazon reviewers of this product,"Many thanks to all of you who offered excellent tips on how to install this product!The tips for using 1x4 strips of wood and creating a paper ""template"" of the wheel and bracket hole placement (tape it over the ceiling mounted 1x4's) made this project much easier (and *safer* when working from a ladder 15 feet above the ground!)Thule: Please improve the tiny instruction ""manual"" and post an installation video on YouTube!"
4,Works Good With Modifications and Additions,"Out of the box, forget it. The screws provided are for concrete, if using rafters buy 1/4"" lag bolts and washers. I choose to build a 2x4 wood frame the proper size for the storaged unit. Putting 1/4"" Hook screws into the rafters and eye bolts and S-hooks on the frame, they were connected with heavy chain. I mounted the hardware for the lift unit on the bottom of the frame. I read a complaint in the reviews about having to turn the hand crank to many turns. A 1/4"" shackle and pin on a 1/2"" x 36' Aluminum Rod and a 1/2"" variable speed drill did the job, just watch the speed. The rope was about 12 feet short of the loop reaching the floor so I rplaced it with a 50 foot 3/16"" rope. The extra rope makes a bigger wind-up roll so it goes up faster. The rope tends to jump the guide wheels very easily."
4,"If you build a frame, it'll work fine...","Installed this system on a 2x4 'H' frame I built, lag bolted to our 10 ft garage ceiling - and it works fine. Our car top box now has a very practical storage - resting above the garage door as it's opened by 5 or 6 inches... Now, we can easily mount our ski box just when we need it - and use the drive-thru car wash too. :-)"
2,small but good,this producs looks huge in the picture but is was very tiny once i received it. I bought it for a gift and was disappointed in the size but the nuts were good.
4,Too much of an okay thing,"I picked this book up because it was suggested ""in addition"" to another book on hospitality that I read recently and thought was life-changing. This book is very good, it includes interesting and thoughtful ideas and it is pretty well written. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading some academic paper prepared in graduate school. While I liked the book fine and it definitely worth reading, I think if fails to measure up to some other books on the market right now. I would certainly suggest it for anyone doing academic work, preparing for a class or inventing some church program."
3,a fun read,"this is the latest dr. who novel from chris boucher, writer of several dr. who scripts during the 4th doctor/leela time period of the series. overall, it's a fun read. parts of it were genuinely spooky and suspenseful, although several of the stock-suspense sequences weren't as successful, perhaps because of their stock-ness. the characters are witty, although at times the wittiness got a bit annoying--the characters are perhaps a little too pleased with themselves. oddly, the characterization of the doctor and of leela seem off to me, albeit not by much--although boucher created leela to begin with! still, the characterization is strong in places, and there are some laugh-out-loud lines, especially near the end, that i can pretty much hear tom baker saying (no spoilers here, but they're the lines to the rats and regarding evolution). i found the ending a bit of a letdown, but i was quite pleasantly entertained throughout, and although i could put it down, i eagerly returned."
3,"Interesting book with the 4th Doctor and Leela, at a college","This book was interesting read with the 4th Doctor and Leela. The Doctor and Leela land in a forest outside a college. They get involved with the college 's ESP department and some college students. Something is wrong at the school. There are students trying to call up the dead with terrible results. Other things are wrong as well. Of course Leela belives it's a Tesh from her home planet. Eventually the Doctor finds out who has been behind all the madness. The villian(s) get their reward. The Doctor and Leela leave. This book was a interesting read as I felt like a part horror/ science fiction book. One of the author's better books.If you like the 4th Doctor and Leela, you might like this novel."
1,razor but not sharp,"This is the worst martial arts feature ever made! As a martial arts instructor, I applaude Mr. Ashford's martial arts technique, however his film making leaves much to be desired. This film was apparently filmed with home movie equipment and with a script in dire need of editing. Don't waste money or time with this ""production."""
1,Not Much To Look At,"I have to say this guy is some thing else.He looks like he could paly cartoon hero, and the film is a joke. It was shot on dad's video camera, with know scrip to read. Save your money......"
5,Jeremy Piven and Jon Favreau made this film,The only thing I didn't like about PCU was that it had too many Liberal Undertones but the movie is funny enough and the cameo by George Clinton and Perliment Funkedelic at the end is priceless.
4,"Finally, someone who realizes being PC has gone too far...","Loved the interaction between the different ""groups"" represented in this movie. The overall theme of ""can't we just all get along"" proves that political correctenss has spiraled out of control. This hysterical comedy targets a rather taboo subject while delivering a consistently laugh-out-loud storyline. Grab a few friends, some party favors, and turn this one up loud so you can hear the great lines over the laughter."
4,Oh yeah,"PCU is a great college comedy. It is a classic, Jeremy Piven is a chicago boy and he is also one of the funniest people currently on tv (Entourage). If you have never seen this movie, it is an absolute must!"
5,MEAT TOSSER!,"If you often find yourself hung-over with nothing to do, PCU is the cure. It will remind you how important it is to have a good time, even if you have to pay for it later. Remember, we're not going to protest PCU. Just order a pizza, take some asprin and enjoy!"
3,It needed a new cast selector while it still had a chance.,"The basis of the movie needed help, the people who selected the main character needed to put the glue down. However, the movie was okay."
3,Animal house of the '90s ... this movie is worth watching,"If you are looking for an Academy Award winner ... look elsewhere. But, if you are looking for a great movie you can laugh at you have found a winner in PCU. Anyone who is sick of political correctness would enjoy the way a group of college students get revenge on just about every group on campus."
2,Not Even A Minor Classic: Missed Opportunity,"...It might have been a good idea but it doesn't come together. PCU doesn't bother to give us any memorable characters or plot. No one has a major part in this movie. Think about it: Tom,the new preppy freshman,after a promising start where his orientation goes horribly wrong, virtually disappears except to be chased. Jeremy Pivens, playing John Belushi's Animal House character, gives a weak John Belushi-style speech rallying his housemates but doesn't have much else to do. David Spade appears from time to time in the thankless role of fraternity snob villain but its hard to feel menaced by such a snide, toothless twerp. Movies like ""Animal House"" (ancient as it is) and ""Real Genius"" - even ""Revenge of the Nerds"" - were far superior in presenting people we remember after the movie is over."
4,College flick with a great cast,"If you like politically incorrect, and you like college movies, this one is for you. It also includes a killer cast of Jeremy Piven, Jon Favreau, David Spade, and even George Clinton!! This isn't a cookie-cutter college movie, it has it's own style."
