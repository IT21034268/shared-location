5,Great Watch,"An awesome conclusion to the show, and it will not leave you disappointed. Just try to pace yourself on episodes, unlike me."
5,House Episodes,All House episodes are great ... it was one of the best series on TV... too bad it had to end I enjoyed all of them.
2,House has sank low,"Sad. The best show on TV sank so low. In this episode we had some poor acting of the new girl whinning about losing her job for smacking a doctor who sexually harassed her (seriously? in this day and age she has fear of fighting the bully?), a new model hot doctor with a non-story, House and Wilson with silly bets and a rich guy that House is trying to blackmail. Boooring! It was my favorite show and now I can barely watch it. The banter between characters is so so forced, overdone and repetative I would catch myself tuning out."
1,House Twenty Vicodin,"Give this less than 1 because I ordered it & was not able to get the show to play....followed the process instructed...a few times. Love the show, looked forward to seeing a re-run but never saw it. Got the bill though......would like it charged off."
3,A bad way to send out house!,"First off I am a hudge house fan and hugh laurie fan so when I found out this season would be the last it was like loosin a family member . This show has been on sense 04 and for 8 years I expected this season to be one of the best. Boy was I wrong. Ok first NO CUDDY I was reallu dissaponted by that, house has a whole new team most of the orignal cast isent even there anymore. No cammeron just awfull the story lines are not as exciting ang from the looks of it willsons gonna die or cancer the one rae of sunshine I had left in this show. Idk I jus think david shore could of sent this show off in a way better fashion espically with all the love and support fans have given the show. Still gonna buy this dvd to add to my house collextion but def not one of my favorite.seasons :("
2,Lost interest After season 5.,"I've Watched House since the pilot episode. Went sideways after season5 and stopped watching. Will miss Olivia Wilde's character though.Someone gave me season 6 and 7 on blu ray as a gift. They are still sitting on my shelf unopened. Will not miss the series.I have moved on to Justified, Homeland, and falling skies."
5,House,"I love House. One of my all time favorites! It's a shame that it's over, but if you've not seen them all finish them! They wrapped the series up so well."
3,Weakest season of House MD,"While season 1-3 were 5 star Television, they startedthe ""same old, same old...."" syndrom with 4-7 and 4 star at the most.Season 8 is only for die-hard House fans. An OK conclusion of a greatTV show at best......"
4,house last season,the stories were not up to the usual standards. the last one was totally bizarre i didn't understand what the heck was going on.
3,Not the strongest season,"I admit, that I was sad to see this series come to an end, but I expected a little more bang for my buck when finally saying goodbye to these characters. The series deserved better."
5,great job,Writers did an excellent job with series finally! I will miss this series. Top notch acting and happy to see how it all ended
5,house,is the best serial is a form of life very interest i saw all serial complete he said very good words and very inteligent
5,The ending is so good!!!!,"A great ending to a great show. The end brings everything together for a show that seemed have lost it way,"
2,Terrible,House was my absolute favorite television show of all time. It should have ended with season 7. This season (season 8) was an awful mess. How something that was so amazing for so many years can take such an absolute nose dive so quickly is beyond me. I'll miss the show but the terrible writing that I forced myself to sit through for the final season will help me let it go. Ouch.
4,House DVD,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas in addition to the other seasons. She has enjoyed watching them. Very good price.
5,Good show,"The movie was priced just right and it showed up when expected, No damage and picture quality is very good."
4,3.5 to 4 stars,"This episode was also enjoyable but also again not like the riveting episodes we once saw in earlier seasons. The case itself is exotic, as usual, and involves a young boy who got sick while trying to emulate his long dead father by becoming a clown. The illness again got so convoluted in diagnosis that I was lost about half way through and just waited for the defining moment when House ""gets it."" The diagnosis was quite surprising and interesting.The interaction among the usual cast of characters is back again. Taub has child issues as he doesn't want his ex-wife to take his daughter to Oregon. Chase gets to know the young woman doctor better and he tries to pry her background out of her (which House wants to know). And, best of all, there is an intricate subplot going where House wants to see a fight in Atlantic City with Wilson but his ankle bracelet and rules of parole stop him from going...or do they?"
4,No table Space Needed,"I bought this stereo for two reasons. 1. I have had Tech stereo equipment before with good results. 2. I very much liked that it could be wall mounted.I love the wall mount, It is totally out of the way. The sound is a little too bassy (as another review wrote). I do not have any problems with the CD door as I use the button to open and close it. I was a little hesitant to buy this as it was a repaired unite... but everything works and looks fine. I also like the sleep timer. I use it every night.All I need now is a FM antena that will pull in more stations (maybe a power one). I live in a country town."
1,Just plain junk.,Do not buy this product. It is exceptionally hard to load and then it will not work. Broderbund has a tech support that hits a new low for not caring about its customers. Sorry stuff period.
1,Impossible for me to install this product,Even though I had all of the system requirements listed to properly install and use this product and followed instructions diligently I found it impossible to start........After many attempts by me and others to get results I ran everything through my shredder and now I feel much better.........I hope you have better luck than I did...........
1,Returned Product,"I was not impressed by the images and less impressed that it was all online. I have a fast computer with 2 hard drives and WiFi internet service which is fast and I had to wait forever for the clip art to load. It does have a nice editing feature, but not nice enough to keep the product."
2,Disappointing.,"Most of the images that I would like to use aren't on the DVD but have to be downloaded from the Internet. I bought the set for its anatomy content, but many of these are cartoons. They would serve the consumer better by separating these collections into categories that were aimed at specific audiences."
2,Misleading,"I cant believe I am reviewing such an old purchase, but I would like to point out that a lot of the content listed in the product description is only available online. Unless I majorly misunderstood something."
5,AWESOME QUALITY,"The only glass wall shelf that doesnt look cheep if you know what I mean. Extra wide glass, high quality and holds an impressive 40 pounds. You will not be dissapointed!"
4,Really nice shelf.,"Nice shelf. Looks really chic and hides cabling well. I bought 5 of these to make an on-wall equipment rack, and the A/V equipment looks like it's floating in the air.I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I found the wood to be easily scratchable. I accidentally scratched the wood panels of one of my shelves to the point where it's easily noticeable upon casual inspection. But the thing is I wasn't really being overly careless (but not being paranoid careful either), thus I've concluded that the wood is just easily scratched. So be careful in handling it."
4,Good Solution for Wall Mounts,"The Omnimount shelving systems are a nice solution to handling components with a wall-mount TV. They have a nicer look than most of the products available and the unit was well-built. A little more attention to cabling options would be nice, but they do provide reasonable flexibility."
1,Do not buy!!!!,"Item was very flimsy when arrived and after 4 small letters were put in it, it broke into 3 pieces."
2,Not well made,I have bought this because i needed an organizer for my mail. It is small and suited my needs. It is not well put together. The front piece was loose and finally came off. I was able to fix it by nailing it back together. It is more sturdier now.
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this item and it was in multiple pieces upon opening the box. It was very low quality and does not look nearly as nice as the picture. Even if it wasn't basically shattered during delivery, I would have returned this item."
1,"Junk, look elsewhere","This sorter looks ok, but it is very flimsy. I'd only recommend this if you are looking to, e.g., sort envelopes. If you want to put file folders or anything bigger in it, the dividers flex and I expect will crack or break any time now."
5,Makes mail sorting a breeze,"Before getting the rolodex mail sorter our mail was stacked haphazardly on the foyer table, the end tables, and pretty much wherever. Groupons and living social deals were being printed over and over because we couldn't find them when walking out the door. Now we have the desktop sorter and life is much easier. We have it sitting on the magazine table in the foyer, incoming mail on the top, outgoing mail next, groupons and living social vouchers, coupons, etc, next, then little reminder notes or whatever needs to be dealt with. It is attractive with a good space between each rise, allowing for a fair amount of mail or paper. The wood is nice and thick and the design is attractive. A good helpful product."
3,"Reasonable pricing, looks great on desk but slots are wiggly","I've ordered these components before- it might be this one has an issue. I actually ordered two- which were shipped separately. When I get the second, I will see if this is a one off issue. Also is smaller than I imagined- make sure you look at the dimensions."
2,meh,Not very attractive on desk. Poorly built and not very useful. the printed grain only kind of resembles mahogany ... kind of. Built my own with spare hardwood I had in the shop. Much better.
4,I like it alot,Love the straining glass lid.Love the size.Like the price.Hate the super glued label that's impossible to get off.I still have glue on the front of the pot even after several washings.Still worth buying.
3,I like the serie and it's a nice size pot,"First of all, I absolutely love that serie of Pots. The lids are well thought (able to drain through them) and The pots seem to be of good enough quality. The only bummer is that my pot had a little bump in the bottom... months later It still bugs me and I wish I would have returned it for a replacement."
5,what you would expect,for a wedding gift not sure worth the price other cheaper options out there to fit the need but hey that is what registrys are for right. their mistake morons
4,"pan OK, beware of label","This pan looked like exactly what I had in mind for my friend. We haven't yet had a chance to cook in it, which I think will be OK for the price. However, biggest complaint is the label on the pan: whoever designed it as far as adhesive should have been FIRED from their job. I spent whole evening scrubbing it off, still not finished. The label is quite large and the sticky stuff does not come off with any trick I tried from google, feeling very frustrated .... I do like the pan but horrendous job on the label, just plain horrendous..."
4,All purpose dutch oven,"I grew up in a household that used stainless steel cookware. But when I left the confines of my parent's home I tried anodized aluminum, cast iron, enamel ware and found each and every one of these ""better"" and more expensive type equipment to have their own particular drawbacks. So I've come full circle and have rediscovered the simplicity of stainless steel. It does everything. The pour spout which is helpful for straining pasta allows steam to escape even when the strainer holes are not lined up. So it's not ideal for low slow braising on the stovetop for hours on end. But for everything else it's a wonderful all purpose dutch oven that I would recommend. It has become an instant celebrity in my kitchen. It's inexpensive as well which is a welcomed bonus."
2,Not worth the money,This pan is nice in theory. If you only plan to use it for big noodles it will work ok. Plan for everything to stick to the bottom. And if you ever strain anything small the pieces will get stuck in the lid between the glass and the metal. Getting those out will take a thin knife or lots of sloshing and hoping. The space is too small to get a dish cloth into. The handles on the pan and lid get almost as hot as the rest of the pan.
5,Love love love it!,"I ordered this pot because I had a larger sized enamel cast iron one and a smaller sized enameled cast iron one.Well this size is just right! The size is perfect for my family,the weight of the pot is heavy enough to not get hot spots,but light enough for me to lift and move around easily. I love the drainage holes in the lid.The stainless is so pretty, I leave the pot on one of my stove burners, that way it is always right there when I need it! I have used it for soups, stews,cooking pasta, and making sauces. It is like my little soldier ready for whatever I throw at it! Get one today!"
2,Wear Ever is stuck on their stickers,"We purchased a beautifully finished and affordable WearEver pot, complete with their patented ""Forever Sticker"". O.K. J.K. maybe they HAVEN'T patented it...yet.After we mucked up the finish using cleaning pads to remove part of the sticker (the NOT ForeverSticker part, apparently...) we were exhausted and disappointed.Our arms and fingers hurt, our beautiful new pot was marred and scarred, and we traded the pot to Wear Ever for another of their products which we could use, but still lack the product we purchased and wanted in the first place.Now, four years later, Wear Ever has maintained and even fortified it's ""Forever Label"" technology, if I read all the reviews correctly.Wake up Wear Ever! The FIRST thing your customer wants to do with your product, even BEFORE cooking with it is...cleaning it for it's first use. And you are relentlessly a problem thanks to your continued refusal to purchase easy to remove labeling."
5,Great pan,"This pan is such a great buy. I can now vent steam so the pot does not boil over, and drain my pasta with ease."
4,Lots of features,"I gave this pot 4stars because while the features are great but the build quality could be better. As a medium duty pot this is worth the money. Two sizes of strainer holes in the lower lid lip, hole sizes are marked on the glass. S for small and SS for large. nice and functional pour spouts, note: the cover handle gets hot and the pot handle gets hot if you grab too close to the pot. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with carpal tunnel or sore joints. Because you have to grab half way back on the handle creating a lot of negative leverage pressure on your wrist. Ok if you use a pot grip or rag, but I have a gas stove and have burned a few dish rags (yes, that is lame but it happens). Good pot for the price."
2,Good thing for the WSJ subscription,"I am really glad the book came with a subscription for 10 weeks of the Wall Street Journal. If it did not have that, I would have a hard time finding justification for the price. It is a very basic and introductory pamphlet."
2,"Shades of Schumann, but Not Enough to be Interesting","Despite a fetching third movement allegretto and a Schumannesque first movement which I found attractive after several listenings, this symphony falls under the weight of a relentlessly boring second movement andante and a concluding movement which tries but fails (to my ears) to pull everything together by restating themese of the preceeding movements. Much of the musical material is of little interest; you'll certainly not walk away humming melodies to yourself. And even in the best moments of the symphony Martucci relies too often on orchestral tuttis to bring musical phrases to a conclusion; I found myself tired of the technique, even at first listening.The performances seem committed, and this disc was a winner of the ""Grand Prix Du Disque de l'Academie Charles Cros"", whatever that is. But I was bored by the music, the first of Martucci's that I have heard. I am not tempted to try more. ."
5,This is it,This is it for Billy Sheehan fans. The long wait is over.This is rock bass at its finest.
3,Could've done better...waaaaay better,"Billy Sheehan...when that name comes up, the image of a bass god comes into mind. Then to top it off I can imagine him touring with Steve Vai and helping him create albums (Real Illusions: Reflection). When I first opened the album, I was anxious to see on who was helping him work his solo project. Guess what? Billy Sheehan...as much as he is a bassist he should NOT sing or play the guitar...it's not that great and it was a huge disappointment for me. The few saving grace for this album is that he demonstrates some of his insane bass chops..."
4,Powerful Modern Music,Bizarre modernist atonality. Addicting Argentinian tunes. Pulse-pounding Latin beat. All this and an awesome orchestra to back it up makes this CD a must-have! This is quite definitely the most powerful and well-written harp concerto ever. It is from this music that other composers like Leonard Bernstein probably got their ideas (think West Side Story).
2,Nellyboy,bought this with a photo ring and was really disappointed in the product. dont waist you money. this product doen't fit the celetron telescope viewfinder. I had to take it and modify it to sit further down into the viewfinder shaft so that my photos would be in focus.
4,Opteka T-mount Camera Adapter for Canon,"Works as intended and has good construction. I wish it would utilize the lens lock mechanism, but it doesn't. I wish it had a visible white line on it to assist in lining it up with the lens opening on the camera when it's dark outside, but it doesn't. But for the price, it's good in my book!"
1,NOT Opteka,"I just received my T-Mount, and discovered that it is a Vivitar, not an Opteka. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, so I don't know if it will have the threading problems that some Vivitar pieces are reported to have, but be ware."
2,Pure quality.,"The first time I attached this piece to my lens the inner part got separated and never came off. considering how careful I was in doing so, I am very disappointed. To prevent damage to my lens I have to find a repair place in order to remove the piece professionally."
5,Works well,"Well made, tight fit on Canon XS Digital SLR. Used to mount camera on telescopes using T-Adapter."
4,Fits perfect...,"PRO: Fits perfect, very fine tuned threads.CON: Bit expensive for what it really is.Other: Best to error on the ""You get what you pay for"" when dealing with telescope equipment."
2,Works- sort of,"I got an Opteka T-mount to adapt a reflective telephoto lens for my Canon. It arrived with the lens and seemed fine, sturdy and well fitted. While it worked properly at first, after a couple of days the inner threaded sleeve came loose from the outer housing, allowing the lens to rotate freely and wobble a bit. It still holds the lens on the camera but makes the lens unreliable; I've ordered a replacement (from a different vendor) that hopefully will hold together."
5,Across The Great Divide,"A good companion read to Levon's ""This Wheels On Fire"". If you are a true Band fanatic, you will not learn a whole lot more but it will jog the older brain cells a little. It will be hard for any group to surpass what these individuals did to revolutionize music in general. When I first took home Music From Big Pink and put it on my Sears phono player, my musical horizons were broadened immediately. I still play it at least once a month, it's my number one disc. I keep to 2 lp's, 2 cd's, a cassette and have a digital 5.1 copy. Concerning has anyone band gotten close, some reviewer or maybe the author mentioned Little Feat. I'm a Feat Fanatic, however I would argue the band that is closest conceptually and overall strength of material and musicianship is Los Lobos."
3,Hmmm..??,"Well this is hard. It's been noted by others that there are inconsistencies with the truth, and they're surely there. Yet, this is the first book I have read that has dealt with the Robbie Robertson vs Levon Helm running feud in a different way. As in.. SHOCK.. it isn't all Robbie's fault and that was refreshing.I read Levon's book, wish Robbie would write one, or Garth too. For that matter maybe John Simon should too because a few things are obvious to all: their first two albums were awesome and it went down quickly (IMO) after that although there were great songs later.This different look on the feud is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it would be 2."
1,"Why is there no ""zero stars"" option?","The only good parts of this book are those that are taken from--and attributed to--other sources. Then, of course, there are the many passages that were out-and-out lifted without attribution. Hoskyns obviously assumed that everything in print about The Band was accurate, because he even lifted the errors.A fun exercise: see how many pages you can find that DON'T contain blatant errors. Better yet, see how many PARAGRAPHS you can find that don't.Hoskyns would love people to think that The Band conspired to not grant him interviews, but that's not the case. The Band was very accessible when Hoskyns was penning this comic book; he just didn't try."
2,WARNING!!!,This book not only contains lessons but LOTS of exercises. If you are buying this book used you should know that whoever USED it before you most likely wrote in it. I did not know this (should have read the reviews) before i bought it. The seller really should have included that in the description. I ended up erasing pages and pages and pages(obviously exercises done in pen couldn't be fixed). It is a HUGE discount to buy this book used. You just have to weigh the options. Would you rather spend 3 times the money for a new one or pay way less and spend hours erasing (and buy some white out too)??
3,beyond toying around,"The Sonic Sleuth is an inexpensive item, but it can be used for more than a toy. It works nicely for listening to things in nature like birds and frogs. The gain control allows you to amplify the sound a lot, and there is a sound cut off to prevent you from getting your ears blown out."
1,False advertisement,"This thing blows. My wife and me stood outside on the sidewalk. I had her test it with me. She would talk then go to the next section of sidewalk. As she moved farther away she would simply say ""do you hear me?"" After about 3 sections of sidewalk I could not hear her anymore. Granted this is a ""toy"" per say but easy on the advertisement. I felt like I could hear her better if I didnt use this device."
2,Fun while it lasted,"Lasted for a few weeks of sporadic use- maybe 20 minutes total time. I never pointed it at anything that made any loud noises so I don't know for sure how the safety cut-off works, but now it routinely turns itself off after just a few seconds. Maybe the safety shut-off just got way too sensitive? The frequency dial works well. This would be lots of fun (and educational) for people who want to spend some quality time with the kids or grandkids. As for quality and reliability, I think $1 per minute of use is excessive."
3,Mommy of 2,"My 9 year old wanted this to spy on family conversations. Little hard to use indoors. ALL sounds are picked up in the home. (ex. TV,running water,radio etc.) He is still having fun using it to magnify other noises besides conversation. We are hoping it works better outside in the summer. Goofy boy is hoping to target neighborhood deck conversations. If it works I could have fun with that too!!!"
2,poor capability,The Sonic Sluth has vsry limited capabilty and is affected by the amount of noise in the areea it is being used in. Handle broke on the 3rd time it was used. Luckily some Locktite glue was available.
1,ccb,cheap junk/on button broke within ten minutes of use/barely amplifies sound/don't waste your money/would have rated total zero if I could
3,I got this for parts,"To be honest, I bought this to take it apart and to try to make an ultrasonic detector. But I did try it in its normal state and it didn't work well at all. It is a toy, so I shouldn't complain too much."
4,It's fun,"it's fun for the whole family, my kids love it, they can hear different birds outside. I can hear some of the conversations going on outside, of course you can't breath cause it picks that up while your trying hard to hear your target."
1,Boo!,This thing worked fine when I first got it in December. I've honestly only used it a handful of times. Now it's March and the last time I recorded a TV show it played half of the show and then it gave me a 'No Disc' error. Now every time I try to watch ANY DVD it won't load and tells me there is No Disc. I'm going to suck it up and spend more for a better brand now. I wish I would have done that in the first place. Don't waste your money.
2,"Good for a quick fix, but not long term","At first this machine was fine, despite not having features found on better known name brands..But after a few months, I started getting error messages for recordable DVDS that were types that had previously been accepted and listed as compatible.Now, it won't accept any blank, recordable DVDs.Getting service was an even bigger problem. I could never get an answer on their phone lines and no response at all to e-mails I sent."
2,Unhappy with media,"This machine works well for store DVDs and burning from TIVO, but when I attempt to view DVD-R discs (all types), I OFTEN encounter the dreaded ""No DISC"" message for discs that play in a variety of other players."
5,savage conquest,"loved it. are there any savage books after this? , would love to know what happened to reis, amanda, randy & blazing star"
2,A Sequel That Doesn't Live Up to its Predecessors,"As devout fans of Poirot and David Suchet who are familiar with all 12 sets of the television series and all the movies up to this set, my wife and I are both saddened and disappointed by the sudden drop in quality. One of the presnt episodes, ""The Hollow,"" typifies the shortcomings of this series, which include highly improbable characters, poor scripts, and some overacting. Suchet is wonderful, as always, but seems to have lost some of his edge here. Part of the problem with these newest films may be attributable to the absence of the trio of excellent characters--Hastings, Chief Inspector Japp, and Miss Lemon--whose interactions helped make the earlier efforts so delightful. Regrettably, we cannot recommend this extra series."
2,New Poirot,"Lacks humor and is boring. Don't bother. Ms. Lemon, Lt. Japp and Hasting do not appear in this set. And it shows."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Poirot fans-Beware! The sloth mongers at A&E; are offering EDITED version of these programs. Some 33 minutes or approximately 8 minutes and fifteen seconds have been removed from each episode. You can pruchase the UNedited version from Amazon.co.uk -- if you have an All-Region player for 13.18 GBP or $US 19.05.Don't be fooled as I was.A&E; should not be allowed to sell edited versions, especially as they are notorious for making bad editing decisions as anyone who has seen the unedited Lovejoys can attest.Caveat Emptor."
5,ADORE POIROT,"I get the biggest kick out of David Suchet's talent and how he has successfully created this whole personality of Poriot. I have been lucky enough to see him perform on the London stage several times & he amazes me. As a result, I just had to have all of the DVD's of this series & I have traveled to some of the locations which are romantized.....escape into the life our grandparents lived & then add a little murder mystery-what more can you ask for!!! ha"
1,Not Up to Suff,"Did not like this series at all! There seems to be a move away from the original stories and an adding of questional material that would not have been in an Agatha Christie novel--shady at best--pitiful at worst! In some cases I felt they tried to change the story altogether. Will not keep this series, plan to sell or give away."
1,Extremely disappointed...,"I'll have to say that I was disgusted with the change in production for the ""New"" Poirot movies. Granted, the filming is quite modernized and very appealing, but the wholesomeness that the older movies had is severely lacking in these 4 videos. I only watched two of them, and decided to send the whole set back. I'm staying with the old colored sets. The production may be cheaper, but I thoroughly enjoyed every one, and that's the Poirot I want to see!Lastly, and maybe the least, the familiar (maybe annoying to some) theme song is sadly missing.I hope that any new videos may go back to the same wonderful nostalgia that I've come to enjoy with Acorn Media films."
4,did not received what I expected,"I LIVE IN MEXICO AND SAW THIS INTERESTING COLLECTION BUT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THESE DVD'S HAD CLOSE CAPTIONS SO I WENT TO ""DETAILS"" AND IT DID SAY IT HAD CLOSE CAPTIONS SINCE I BOUGHT THEM FOR SOMEONE WHO CANNOT HEAR, WELL I RECEIVED THEM AND THEY DID NOT HAVE CLOSE CAPTIONS AS INDICATED UNDER DETAILS AND THE WORST PART IS THAT I ORDERED TWO SETS THE HERCULE POIROT AND THE MISS MARPLE SET. I WAS VERY MUCH DISSAPOINTED IT DID SAY SOMETHING UNDER DETAILS AND I DIDNT GET WHAT I EXPECTED......"
5,classic Poirot,"These films are classic Poirot. Very well photographed, very well casted. David Suchet is awesome. I think he is the best Poirot yet."
4,Happy with purchase,If you like Agatha Christie and/or mysteries this purchase is a no-brainer. The scenery and locations are wonderful.And David Suchet is the consummate Hercule Poirot. At times the plots diverge from the original novels but are interesting and in a way it's almost as if you're reading a new Agatha Christie book.
3,not as good as the Acorn series,"While, thanks to the wonderful presence of David Suchet, this collection of Poirot is enjoyable - they are just not as good as the Acorn releases. Trivially, that delightful theme is missing. Not so trivially, this collection relies on the tawdry and sensational rather than the characters and plot, as the previous collections did.Overall, good but not as good as Acorn's."
1,THIS BEYBLADE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,DO NOT GET THIS BEYBLADE I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS BEYBLADE!!! When I first got this blade I thought it was going 2 be good but when battled it didn't beat any of my brother's or friends beyblades. Zeus is a BAD BLADE! THE Attack ring kept on falling off and it was getting on my nervse!!!! So I'd Highly Recommend u do not get this blade!!!!!
1,Save your money,"Save your money. No need to buy the travel shoe bags. They are over-priced, made in China merchandise. Even my husband's size 11 shoe will not fit in these bags. They are useless! Basic drawstring closure. There has to be a better product out there. Keeping looking. NOT RECOMMENDED . . . ."
5,Perfect !!!! works like a charm,"These shoe bags are perfect. $6-7 for a set of THREE, you can't beat it - Amazon Prime.They fit a mens size 12 shoe just perfectly... anything larger i'm not sure of...Simple draw string - they could add one of those plastic draw string spring clamps, but then again they work perfectly just the way they are.for the money and amazon prime free shipping - there's nothing that will come close !!!!"
3,plastic-like,"I got these for my husband. He travels and is always sticking his shoes in plastic grocery sacks. Thought it was time to upgrade to something a bit better, and that's what these are a ""bit"" better."
5,Wish I'd found them sooner,"I am a fitness instructor and I always need to change into my workout shoes when I get to the gym. My newest gym bag didn't have a special shoe compartment, which led me to finding a way to keep my dirty shoes off of my other things. These bags are great and not only do I use them for the gym, but also in my suitcase to pack my spare shoes.The bags are a black nylon with drawstring. For me, the size is just right and I can easily fit a pair of my shoes. My husband's shoes fit easily as well. I will be buying more for the whole family.P.S. If you use these for gym shoes, you need to take your shoes out when you get home and let them air out. If you leave sweaty gym shoes in this bag for long, you'll soon be doing an Amazon search for ""shoe deodorizers."""
5,nylon travel shoe bag,"Item was as advertized.I have smooth transactions when ordering from Amazon.com. If there is a problem, Amazon.com takes care of it very quickly."
1,Over a million sales and no book review todate !!!,"With over a million sales, one would think that someone has taken the trouble to provide a review !!!The following is the "" Amazon.com Sales rank "" for this book1,217,385And mine is the "" first review "" ???Give me a break !!!"
4,A Great Doom Metal Band,"When I heard about Yob being signed to metal blade I thought great! a doom metal act that'll get exposure. Before Yob I don't think Metal Blade had a doom metal band since Trouble. But I did wonder, what kind of doom metal band would Metal Blade sign? Whoa! Musically I would say they have a stoner/doom feel to them, but they don't have a huge drug user image about them. The music is true doom, slow and heavy, with very long songs and very few songs. If you like doom metal, you will like it. If you are just a true metalhead, you should still give them a listen."
4,See relapse isn't all crap.,"This is more for the doom, and not as much on the stoner as the previous album and their demo. But still worth adding to the collection. For me it is a no brainer b/c I like the doom even though this is on relapse, it is still good."
4,Desk Combo,"works well and is as described, no issues. This is the second one of these in our household. Would recomend it."
2,Would not recommend,"I find that the LapWorks Laptop Desk does not significantly cool your lap or laptop. I use my laptop on my lap, not on a desk, and I even tried using this product on my lap in the folded desk position to further lift the laptop from my legs- my legs still got hot. It may prevent burned legs, but the comfort level leaves too much to be desired. Also, it would be nice to have the mouse pad a permanent feature and on a hinge so that it would fold under for packing in a computer bag. Maybe if the frame had support legs that would lift it off your lap. All in all I cannot recommend spending $30+ on this product. Linda"
2,Not Impressed!,I thought this would be great to use until I got it and opened the package. It's very hard to try to balence it on your lap if you have it folded and tilted up. If you lay it flat the middle of it bumps up and whatever you have on it is not evenly balenced. It's a piece of plastic! That's it!...It's ok on a hard surface like a table to use and if you have a larger lap top forget this because it won't fit!
1,Save your money,"Product just a piece of flimsy plastic. Computer slid off, unit awkward to use, bought a much better, similar type unit at local dollar store for lower price!"
5,Practical little volume on English prose rhythm,"This is an excellent companion volume to Saintsbury's A History of English Prose Rhythm. In a practical manner, Tempest discusses the nature of rhythm, prose-rhythm, and cadence; he then compares rhythms and their usages in select passages from Ascham, Browne, Burke, DeQuincey, Dryden, Gibbon, Hobbes, Ben Jonson, Samuel Johnson, Taylor, and the Authorized Version of the Bible. Includes a brief glossary and bibliography. Both Tempest's and Saintsbury's volumes are hard to find, but are worth the effort if you enjoy the study of English prose style."
2,Dated,These are seriously dated and do not read well almost 20 years after they've been written. Give them a pass.
4,just good music,"One of the really good albums, by far their best work. The song ""Where dead angels lie"" is quite possibly one of the greatest metal songs of all time. A definate must have for any fan of the genre."
4,Midisport Uno MIDI interface,"I used the Midisport Uno MIDI interface to connect a Concertmate 990 (aka Casio CTK-601) keyboard to a computer running XP and NoteworthyComposer. The arrangement is not entirely satisfactory but the problem is in the software, not the Midisport Uno.Installation of the Midisport Uno is simple and straightforward. However, the auto-install CD directed me to connect the USB at start of installation. It appears to me that the connection should in fact be made after installation is complete. This flaw (at least I think it is a flaw) is why I gave less than five stars."
2,Stuck notes with UNO on a Roland keyboard,"When I upgraded to a new WinXP64-bit computer, there was no MIDI socket on the back of the sound card, so I couldn't use my music keyboard anymore for my arranging work in Finale.I was looking for a USB device to connect a Roland A-37 keyboard to my Dell computer.Software installation was easy on the first try.However, the device had a problem: there were repeated stuck notes (ciphers) where I had to re-press the key on the Roland to make the sound stop. After a few minutes of this, I started looking for another solution, which I found in the EDIROL UM-1ex, built by Roland.The UM-1ex worked flawlessly on the first try.If you have a different keyboard, the UNO might work for you; it didn't work for me with a Dell computer and Roland A-37 keyboard."
1,Midisport Interface,"I have not been able to get my midisport uno to work. Maybe I am not loading the software correctly. I have not been able to get any support from the websight. I have tried pursuing support from others but haven't gotten it to work, yet. Hard to rate item since I have not seen it work yet - if it will.Missy Merritt"
4,Works OK here,"Works fine for me with an old Yamaha PSR-500 on my Gentoo Linux desktop PC. The latest kernel (2.6.27) recognizes it as soon as I plug it in. KMidi will play MIDI files on it just fine, and I can record into Rosegarden without problems. I don't seem to be having any of the problems other folks are having with PSR keyboards. Guess I'll have to wait and see how it holds up long-term.Based on some googling, there seems to be two primary issues with this device: some marginal electrical connectivity that works with some keyboard/controller MIDI outs but not others, and a broken implementation of MIDI input running status. The Linux driver actually compensates for the latter issue. The former is a crap shoot."
2,Incompatible with Yamaha PSR-530,"It's not completely unusable, but every 100 notes or so it suddenly lights up the entire MIDI stream with random notes in all Octaves. I was playing a choir and the sudden devil shouts and screeching almost gave me a heart attack. I guess this is a common problem. M-Audio makes a real nice 49-key USB controller that's only $99... I'd buy that instead unless you have a real nice keyboard, but do a Google search to make sure it's compatible first."
3,Big Goof!!,I should have read the reviews before I ordered this interface and it may have saved me many hours of time trying to get it to work. I have a Yamaha PSR keyboard and this interface does not work on it. I suppose if you had a different keyboard that it worked on it would be fine.
1,M-Audio does not support 64 Bit OS (Windows),This is a horrible company. I would recommend staying far away from anything M-Audio makes. They don't support their own hardware. They refuse to make 64 bit drivers for some of their devices (Radium49 for example). I would recommend getting a different brand because you can be guaranteed that this company will not provide updated drivers for any product you buy in the future.Buyer beware.
1,don't trust them,"i've tried to use this on two macs. terrible resultsm-audio does not have forums on their site.there is a reason. their drivers are unreliable and highly incompatible.absolutely refuse to provide any documentation nor do they accept returns.if you value the stability of your computer, stay clear. stay well clear."
1,A real puzzle,"I bought this interface to record my Yamaha Drum DTXpress III on my PC (Windows XP) using Magix Music Maker and Quartz Audio Master. I have to follow instruction of one of the reviewer here (Araki) to install the UNO correctly. But, then I was not able to record myself using the two software specify above. So I spent time reading their Help Guide and do google search in an attempt to understand MIDI, sequencer, etc. I download Midi-ox to see if commands was sent when i hit a drum trigger. Midi-ox confirm that USB uno is working. But... why the software didn't recieve the commands (no MIDI notes appears on the editor screen and the volume gauge stay at zero). It did one week that i got the UNO and i'm still not able to use it well. Maybe i'm dumb! For all this trooble, if i had know... i had not purchase it."
1,Doesn't work with Yamaha PSR GX76,"We just spent a lot of time trying to configure this MIDI device, to work with Sibelius Student Edition. Our keyboard is a Yamaha PSR-GX7. It doesn't work properly; we are trying to download newest drivers but after reading all of the reviews don't have a lot of hope it will work. We have Windows XP. I hope I can return it. Good luck if you buy this, make sure you can return it."
3,"Faulty unit, no recourse --UPDATE","With this type of product, if you run into problems, you might be left wondering if you have a software issue, a driver issue, or a glitch somewhere else in the chain.Whenever I've used it, there are stuck notes, and a random note-on here & there. Always assumed it was something else, but after over a year, I'm officially giving up on it. Too late to take back, and it does not fall into the range of serial numbers that would be affected by a recall (for a defect that causes the same symptoms).I tried contacting their customer service, but the link did not work (for a few days, anyway).It's a brick.AFTER ANOTHER FEW MONTHS I SENT THE UNIT BACK WITH A LETTER EXPLAINING MY SITUATION. I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT THEY SENT A REPLACEMENT THAT HAS BEEN WORKING PERFECTLY."
5,Works like a charm!,"I actually bought this without any real research, primarily because of an immediate need. Once I had it, I noticed a lot of negative reviews around the web. However, I've had no problems. As a matter of fact, this thing works great and I highly recommend it! I set it up with my Mac and it works like a charm. Thought it was faulty at first but it turned it to be my own error. It's the right price and does the job."
1,Does not work with yamaha,"After trying to get this to work for hours, I discovered that this was just sending random messages to my computer. Later I read that this does not work with yamaha keyboards. Very disappointed."
4,"Simple, Easy, Effective Midi In/Out addition","Installation was a snap, works fine with the MIDI keyboards I have,I did not experience the lag that some people mentioned, and my keyboards were both $50 specials, since I do not use onboard sampling, etc, I use the MIDI keyboards as a controller, and this little unit did the job.I bought one of those El-Cheapo generic ones off ebay, it arrived broken!Even then I highly doubt it would have worked on my Mac.I used this cable on Windows & Mac, and it worked without a hiccup.My only gripe is, its not made out of rugged material, and for the price they could have easily slapped it in an aluminum casing. So its ok for home use, but if you take this on the road, you better bring a backup one."
1,It broke,"I used this product successfully at first, but then I unhooked to move. When I went to hook it back up at the new house, the metal connection on the MIDI-out thing came out of the plastic casing....busted. I think a product should be able to stand up to being hooked up and unhooked. Piece of junk. Looking for an alternative now..."
1,Please - check the M-audio forum before you buy,"If you have Windows Vista or Windows 7 chances are it will NOT work. The company is still in the process of developing drivers that work and it is completely hit or miss (MOSTLY MISS!)The Uno was developed for XP and works for that system.Beware - check out the forum and judge for yourself.According to the M-Audio website, my uno should just connect to my Vista 64 bit OS without ANY needed driver.Needless to say it DID NOT WORK. Even trying 32 bit drivers did not work. Completely frustrating. NOT RECOMMENDED.UPDATE:I ordered a generic ""USB MIDI Cable Converter"" PC for Windows Vista by HDE from Amazon at 1/10 the price! According to several reviewers it works for Vista 32 and 64 bit! It worked for me on a Vista 64 bit system out of the box without a problem. I am using Band in the Box 2004. Now why can't M-Audio do the same?"
1,Doesn't work with Yamaha,"Doesn't work with Yamaha keyboards, including my P140. Waste of time. The new driver on their website isn't helpful, either."
1,Save your $$$,Only used it once since it would not work. It did not work well when I connected my Roland AX-7 Keyboard Controller to it.
4,Works with Roland MT-32 on Win and Mac,"This device was used to connect an old Roland MT-32 to PC. It worked with the default Microsoft drivers (built-in to Windows) just fine. SysEx messages were conveyed properly. I did not notice any issues with dropped notes. The same is true with OS X. Just worked. However, when I did try the latest M-Audio drivers from their website, Windows started crashing, naming the driver as the culprit. I un-installed the driver and things went back to normal. I also tried E-mu Xmidi 1x1, and it did not send the SysEx messages, causing all the music to play with the wrong instruments."
1,Waste of money,"After countless posts and tickets opened with M-audio technical support I went out and bought a Roland EM-2ex. All the issues I was experiencing (random notes playing, device not recognized, etc) are a thing of the past. The only thing that really bothers me is that I spent around $50, and could have returned the product for a refund if I hadn't spent time trying to get it to work (as the M-audio technician said it would).The last update to my technical case was the technician saying that this unit did in fact not work with my akai ewi, and I should instead go out and buy a 1x1. The uno seems to work fine for some, but if you are one of the unlucky few, good luck getting any kind of support or firmware update. I would recommend you avoid at all cost."
1,MIDI input did not work,"DO NOT RECOMMEND - HDOA (half dead on arrival). Got this device, installed it, connected to my Casio WK-3000 keyboard. MIDI output (to keyboard) worked great, input did not work. Since I bought my Casio used, I thought it might be the keyboard. Took me a while to round up another to try (out of town for a while) - but same thing when I did. Bought a new (MUCH cheaper - $10) MIDI USB interface, had in working in two minutes. Unfortunately my return window had expired :(DO NOT RECOMMEND - there are much cheaper alternatives, and they work!"
4,For my delay Update,I used this Cable for my timeline updating its very nice the only problem its that you will need to update drivers for your computer. And you do not know what driver is so you have to looking knowlege base from the website.
5,had them for a bit and still going well,I am totally happy withy it. I use it with my Alesis DM10 Studio Drum Kit. very easy to setup and install. Awesome to have for a MIDI Interface. AWESOME!
2,Not for the faint of heart,"I found this book difficult to follow and understand. I bought it as a supplement to my children's history program and found that it just wasn't ""readable"". I found the material disjointed and incomplete. It's Christian text, and I am a Christian, but the book is on the shelf collecting dust."
3,Every young student should examine this book.,"This is a book that can be judged by the cover. The painting on the cover. ""The Prayer at Valley Forge"" by Arnold Friberg makes the purchase of the book a bargain. The Theocratic Historical perspective will offend some. The weakness of the book is that it one sided and does not present a secular point of view as an alternative. This book when placed on your coffee table with the cover visible always will stimulate conversation because of the cover.This book has a definite ""Christian"" or ""Evangelical"" perspective. It makes a broad sweep of history and misses important debates and details. The photos of the founders and images of the original documents are helpful and instructive to younger students. Three Stars because it is presents only one point of view. It is a minority view point that is not generally heard today. It is worth a purchase because it will give you a good snapshot of the American ""Evangelical"" world view."
1,Doesn't Square with the Facts,"As pointed out by other reviews, this book twists historical facts. A large portion of it is an 1800's protestant style rewriting of Church history made for only one purpose - to shamelessly discredit Catholicism. Don't waste your time reading fictional history."
5,A real eye opener,"I love how this book shows the way Gods plan has worked in the making of the United States of America. It shows how our leaders followed Gods ways in forming the Bill of Rights, Constitution etc.All Americans should read this book. My husband used it for adult Sunday school. Everyone loved it."
1,My Poor Ignorant Niece,"My mother is using the mis-information, deceptions, and out right lies contained in this book, and others like it to brainwash my niece.Only a fool, ideolgue, or a liar would write a book based on the premise the United States is a 'christian nation.'This should be ""tagged"" fiction and consigned to the the ridicule bin.Want a good history book, check out Thom Hartmann's ""What Would Jefferson Do?"" :A Return to Democracy (ASIN:1400052092) or the 'classic illustrated styled' ""We the People: A Call to Take Back America""ASIN:1882109384 ] Well written and more importantly, factually accurate."
1,The reviewer below has no clue what he's talking about ...,"The reviewer below has no clue what he's talking about ... what evangelical seminaries study today IS Koine Greek, not modern Greek. Any biblical linguist can tell you that. My piece of advice for the previous reviewer: don't talk about what you don't know; it helps avoid embarassments like this."
5,Languages change.,"Some people,sadly a vast majority have not realized languages change down through the years. The Koine Greek used 2000 years or so ago is no longer the Greek language many bible institutes study,and even the Strongs Concordance uses. Also ""The Greek manuscript"" is not accurate either there is more than one Greek manuscript out there. So for these critics to listen to their modern scholars and use thier modern Greek, and modern bibles to criticize it is sad the ignorance out there. I recommend anything Laurence Vance writes,unless you follow down the slippery slope of modernism."
3,Morgan's Biography Missing One Big Player,"A&E;'s Biograghy of Pierpont Morgan is an excellent account of Morgan's life as told by many biographers. Yet it is missing the huge role that Anthony Drexel played in his shaping of Morgan's life and business career. Tony Drexel took Peirpont on as a partner in Drexel & Co., already a well established banking house, which had ties to Junius Morgan in Europe. It was Drexel that purchased the land for Pierpont in New York and he served as a role model and the principal decision maker in the combined firm. Not until after Drexel's death, when Pierpont was 56 years old, did the Drexel, Morgan & Co. bank get renamed to J.P. Morgan as we know it today.After watching the biography or reading ""The House of Morgan"", I'd encourage you to read Rottenberg's, ""The Man Who Made Wall Street"".The Man Who Made Wall Street: Anthony J. Drexel and the Rise of Modern Finance"
2,Intro to UML,"Perhaps I should have read more into the title, but this book is really just an intro to UML. I was looking for a DB architecture book to boost my design skills but instead I got a basic UML book that just happens to be applied to data modeling. If your looking for a book on database design, look elsewhere. If your looking for a book on understanding UML applied to databases, pick this one up."
2,More Like a Rubber Mallet Than a Sledge Hammer,"My thoughts on this album...RADIO FRIENDLY If you like this band my predictions are that they will be on MTV in a blink of an eye. The album ""WE ARE THE ROMANS"" surpasses this twenty fold. If you are looking for a spastic band to call your hell listen to ""IF HOPE DIES"", This isn't so repetitive in every way"
5,Genius punk metal,This is an amazing album. It is innovative and intense. I wish I had discovered their music before they broke up.
5,Kids Dig Into Egyptian History,"Our grandchildren, ages six and 13, were delighted to ""excavate"" their sand blocks and find the four Egyptian ""artifacts"" hidden inside. They learned new words; were introduced to a remarkable civilization that existed for thousands of years, and loved the treasures they found.This product was a fun way to peek their interest in the Egyptians, and when this subject comes up in school they will already have some positive experience that I am sure will boost their interest to pay attention!For a more extensive Egyptian project try the Slinky Brand Experiment #156, ""Our Amazing Mummies"". This kit has a very informative brochure, and the project involves using a plaster-of-Paris mould to make two mummies, a small amount of sanding, painting, measuring and cutting small strips of linen. Kids get to practice several skills, which makes this kit is a favorite mine."
3,Nice Gift,This was a gift for my god son along with some other Egypt themed stuff. He liked digging for treasure.
3,Can do better,"I bought the CD 'cause I love ""Una vita da mediano"", but most of the songs in the album are not Luciano's standard. ""Buon compleanno Elvis"" was another thing...."
4,"Avant , 21st Century composer music and UK jazz","The fusion here is not of jazz and rock. It is a rather odd (but it works!) mixture of Avant , 21st Century composer music and UK jazz. Many well known players such as Ian Carr, John Marshall and Chris Lawrence appear. Well worth a listen!"
3,Skips theories and gets right down to semantics of .NET,"The book covers most of the building blocks of the .NET platform, such as the Language Runtime, Framework Class Library, ASP .NET Web Form, Server and HTML Controls, Windows Forms, GDI, ADO .NET, XML and Web Services.The book's style is more like a manual due to the abundant use of bullet points. It's good for those who'd like to skip the theories and get down to the semantics of the .NET platform fast.It does not stand out compared with some other .NET books because it does not go deep enough in each topic. Sometimes, I feel like reading an abridged version of the Visual Studio Online Help Topics with simple sample codes added.I'd like to suggest that practical, more in-depth solutions be provided as examples for using the .NET platform. -- Reviewed by Timothy D."
3,A bit goooey,Lip gloss is supposed to be nourishing and moisture rich but this lip gloss takes it to another level. Goes on gooey and dries sticky. The color is pretty just don't eat anything.
5,itll be your new favorite shade no matter what your skin tone is,"great product as mary k products usually are. this item arrived quickly and brand new as described. its think and has the lip feel of chapstick, only lighter, smells great and is a subtle grown up girly tint of pink. must have. purchase two because the tube is small and youll run out quickly because its just that pretty"
5,fantastic product,"Great product, works and cleans very well! A must for ice cream lovers,terrific! Love it!"
1,The design is great but the coating peels off easily. Avoid.,"As are most Oxo products, this scoop is easy to use but unfortunatly the coating peeled off within a few months even though we always hand washed it. Unless you like flakes in your ice cream, avoid this one."
2,non-stick coating flakes off,"I have many OXO products in my kitchen and will continue to buy them, but the non-stick coating on this one started to flake off (and into the ice cream). I tossed this one and am buying a different one."
1,Color changing,Saw this in a store in Branson and later found it on Amazon and bought it. Works good looks good until it got into the dishwasher. The silver appearance turned to a dark gray. Figured we shouldn't of used the dishwasher even though the package mentioned nothing about it. It also started to corrode on the edges. Ordered a second one from Amazon making surenot to repeat the first activities. After washing it in the sink in hot water the second one turned dark gray also. Now I have a matched set. Don't recommend this item unless you like corroded dark gray metal utensils.
5,Very nice wood pencil cup,"This is from the same people who made the contact organizer that I reviewed. It is very nice wood and looks nice on my husband's new desk. I highly recommend it. Very rich looking, as all the pieced I got in this line are."
5,Good one in this price,"It's a cheep little one.However, the weight is kind of light but it's ok for me.If you are looking for a simple pen holder with good price, I think this one is a right choice"
3,Pencil holder,This product is very light a smaller than you would think. If you news this for an office or need to hold alot of items and pencils don't get this this is just for aprox. 12 pens or pencils. Very nice collie though.
4,"Very interesting, quite informative","Very interesting, quite informative, not bad at all. I enjoyed it, even thought it was a bit light. I wish there would be more in-depth review on Confucius's philosophy."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Something is missing in this biography and it's called depth. There is so much more that could have been said about the great Confucius but all we get is a very shallow overview. Budgetary issues and picture confusion doesn't help much either. If you don't know anything about the man's history it will be average. Otherwise, your score will be lower, I suspect. ACCURACY: B minus to B; INFO IMPARTED: C minus; PASSION FOR THE PERSON: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: early April 2011; MY GRADE: C."
1,Cheap budget,"This is a good overview of Cunfucius, however, the document material was so poor, they mixed the picture of the Ching dynesty (which is 2500 years after the death of Confucius) with the Confucius life."
4,Smooth transaction,"Product represented accurately. Shipped out quickly and arrived in fine condition. Overall nice, smooth transaction."
5,A definite must-read!,"This is one of the best mystery anthologies I have ever read! The stories are well written and contain twists that will have you thinking about the story long after you have moved on to the next one. If you like short, engaging suspense stories, you will love this book."
2,No separate compartments,"This underbed storage does hold sixteen pairs of shoes, but the dividers do not go all the way down, so the shoes easily slip into the next section, particularly when it is pulled out from under the bed. Because of this, it is only slightly better than throwing all your shoes in a clear underbed storage container."
2,Dissapointing,"I was unable to make this under-the bed shoe storage work. The plastic folded and it did not allow me to view the shoes, as anticipated. It was not what I expected."
4,50 Pound? No. Vault? Yes,Doesn't meet the 50 pound tare with large kibble (I use/buy 52 pound sacks of Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition from Costco). Perhaps smaller kibble would meet the advertised specs. I still give the vault a high rating as it keeps the kibble very fresh. I just wish the vittles vault company would more clearly explain kibble size to vault size proportions.
4,Cheaper at Costco,Great dog food container but might want to check Costco first. I saw the 60 lb one there for 23.00ish. The 50 lb one was 31.00ish on Amazon. :( Too late for me to return but thought I would save someone else a buck.
2,Seals food if you could screw on cover,"I ordered these because of the high review points on Amazon and have been using these containers (3) for over a week. trying to screw on the lid is a long and frustrating experience and most of the time I can't do it, or anyone in my family. They were advertised as stackable-but the containers will slide right over each other if you push on the lid at all. But if you have alot of time to try and put on the lids and don't stack them they probably seal the food well."
4,convenient kibble storage,purchased 2 of these as we buy 40lb bags of kibble for our dogs. glad i ordered the 60lb stackable vaults as our dog kibble would not fit into the 40lb vaults. all-in-all quite convenient. not hard to open.
1,"Defective: lid does not seal properly on the one I got, so buyer beware!","Just a quick note to let you know that the lid of the 50 pound Vittles Vault that I just purchased does not fit tightly, no matter how carefully it is screwed on. I am returning this product for a refund. If you buy any Vittles Vault product, be sure to check the lid! On the one I got, I can feel it rocking and hear it groaning when I put pressure on opposite sides. No way is this air tight. I have used gamma seals for many years and have never had this serious problem! Buyer beware!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DJOOI/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details"
3,Not Squirrel Proof,"My mistake. I purchased the item without reading the fine print. I purchased two vaults to hold bird seed. The squirrels first ate through the lid. After I placed ceramic barriers on the lids, they ate through the side of the vault. Only took them two days to discover the seed in the vaults and make quick work of entry."
2,Its ok it does the job,The rubber seal falls off but other then that it does the job. Opening can sometime be difficult. My dog doesnt like it because he cant get into it.
2,Questionnable seal?,"We just bought the this storage container a few months ago. We're not sure if the dog food we bought was contaminated with moths, but when we got toward the end of the dog food left in container, it had moths and larva in. It made us question whether the lid seal is bad or if strangely the dog food was bad. Needless to say, we are disappointed and may try to fix the seal."
4,30-pound container,"Found 30# size at my local pet club store for about same price. They had large selection of sizes too. Amazon's prices are better for the larger sizes. I was hoping costco still had the front loading ones, but they were out. I buy 15# bags of cat food and the whole bag fits nicely into 30# without emptying. I like keeping the food in bag so container needs less washing and added freshness for food. Oils from food will coat inside of containers, not healthy over time. Plus I don't always trust plastic. A bit pricy, hope it holds up, time will tell."
5,This works perfectly,"I use this to keep my grains for brewing dry, bug and critter free. It holds a 50 pound bag easily. Quite easy to get the grains out on brew day as well. May have to get a couple more of these!"
3,Food containers,"This item is very well made, however it does not stack-as it claims. The 30 pound container as well as the 40 pound container, which I bought because it claimed to be stackable, does not stack what so ever. Be extra careful with these conatiners because they simply do not stack. I do not recommend this product to stack, only to buy as an individual container. It was too costly to send these back, so I had to give these away."
5,"Nice Size, Fits On Shelf","Purchased the 40lb container after reading the reviews. I will be putting a 30-35lb bag of dog food in it. Fits great on our wire shelving unit. (See photo.) The bin was $10 on Amazon than in the store, arrived in 2 days. Sturdy and the scoop is a good size."
4,Excellent Pet Food Container,The Vittles Vault works very well. It has a good seal which helps keep the dog food as fresh as possible. I also like the way the lid screws on - no hinges or clips to break. All in all we feel we received value for our money.
5,Easily Holds a 30lb bag of dog food and keeps my dogs out,I was looking for something that would store a 30lb bag of dog food and successfully keep my three retrievers out and this does the job! My three dogs never even bother the canister!
2,Bad top,This is way overpriced for what you get. The twist off top doesn't close well it is hard to line up the top to close. The picture shows two on the amazon web site but the price is per container of one
2,"Almost fits a 30 pound bag of dog food, so lets call it a 27 pound vault","Just call it what it is and don't waste my time. Works and looks great otherwise, just know the size."
4,Great buy,"Great product and the lid is fine to take on and off. Just don't need to tighten it too much or else it could be difficult, but overall this is great and much better than an open bag!"
5,Love it!!!!!,"Big container that can fit plenty of food. It seems to really help keep food fresh too. My dogs will get less interested in food as we get to the bottom of the bag, but this has not been an issue now that we've got the container. Anyway, I would highly recommend this product if you're looking for a container that will keep your dog's food fresher longer."
5,Excellent Container,"I now own four of the VIttles vaults used to hold anything from dog food to horse treats, to grain. They work fabulous and keep the rodents away!"
4,"Pricey, but good","I don't know if anyone has noticed, but dog food smells. Now, I'm not the kind of guy who complains too much about the smell of a bag of dog food sitting in the garage, but I'm not the only one who notices it: critters (squirrels, etc) tend to have olifactory systems as well. And while I don't mind the smell of a bag of food, I certainly do mind the smell of raccoon feces!So I bought the 50lb Vittle Vault and filled it with salt for clearing the driveway of light snow in the winter.As for the raccoon... I bought a Sig 522 and an AAC Suppressor. :)"
2,"Huh, wha? I only get one?","Picture and description are not very clear. I see a pic of two containers that show a 40lb capacity. I assumed that I was getting two 20lb capacity containers, meaning that half the food stays VERY fresh during the two months it takes Fido to consume it. I got one large one. A 40lb bag doesn't quite make it in there. All said, this is the best food container out there so I'm keeping it."
1,Buy a paint bucket instead,Like the other person that gave this item only 1 star I would say to buy a paint bucket instead because that's just what I did.
2,"Fine containers, not stackable",I love the Vittles Vault series - they hold a ton and seal well.I bought these units for their stacking ability and that is whatfalls short. There really isn't much of an indentation and thetop unit is constantly shifting and attempting to fall off.
4,Sturdy and works great,We ave 3 of the 60 lb units and 3 of the 40 lb units. We have the 60 lb vaults placed next to each other with a 40 lb vault stacked on top of each. The stacking works nicely although they can move around a bit when empty (as expected). The 60lb vaults each hold a large bag of chicken feed or large bag of dog food. We use the 40's for our cat and older dog. Overall the system works quite well with the lids fitting securely but easy to open (my wife has no issues opening/closing them). The rubber gasket which create the lid seal can come out on occasion but is placed back on the lid easy enough. Overall a great buy.
4,Doesn't stack well...,"This is an excellent pet food container which seals the food against insects, rodents and the occasional hungry canine. I have two of them which I purchased to hold 30-pound bags of two different varieties of dog foods.This is the reason I reduced the rating to 4-stars instead of 5-stars...The problem when these units are stacked is that 30-pounds of food comes well over the lip of the container and will flow out. If you absolutely need to stack the units, be aware that you cannot fill them anyway near their capacity.However, since I have room to keep these containers side by side, the caps are at the top of the container and I can fill them with 30 pounds of dog food. I have not attempted to fill these with a full 40-pound bag and I am not sure the unit would accomodate that much food."
5,"Lots of reviews, yet good product","I purchased this a few weeks ago. I placed this container right where we are having issues with ants. I put some dog food in it. Not a lot just enough to test it. Absolutely no problems.I find the reviews for this item to be more about other complaints then just keeping bugs out.Why would anyone throw a full bag of expensive dog food in a container before testing it ? Why leave it out side ?If you need to leave out side one would think a person would know critters will eat through plastic to get the food. Some complaints are over stacking. Yes it says stackable, if its protecting the contents in side the container isn't that a major plus.Most reviews for this item are are not about how it protects the food inside but rather what it doesn't do out side the container.My only complaint is for something so simple and made of plastic. It sure is expensive, yet so is the dog food my dogs eat. They don't eat the cheap junk, a healthy dog eats good healthy dog food."
5,Exactly as advertised,"Nothing fancy, but well constructed. Bought to store organic dog food that must be kept in a dark, cool area. Fits 30 lb bag of food, if not a little more. Air-tight and fits in the cabinet under the kitchen counter. No complaints!"
4,Air tight,"I purchased 2 of these-one for dog food and one for cat food. In the summer, I have always had trouble with moths getting into the dry food in my garage so this year I purchased these. They work really well at keeping the food safe from bugs and moisture. The only thing I don't like is that you need both hands to unscrew the lid -one to catch it when it falls. I find it hard to grip without it sliding out of my hand. Item is well made and worth the investment."
3,It works but is slightly misleading,"First, I am happy I purchased this unit for holding my dogs food, but I will be pointing out what I didn't like. I wish it was a little higher quality build (probably just thinker plastic would do). You notice this sometimes when you are putting on the lid and it cross-threads a lot giving you that cheap feeling.The biggest issue is that it is 40-pound non-stackable or around 30-pound stackable. To fit 40-pounds in it you would have to lay it on its back so the lid is on the top. It will hold it, but it is no longer stackable. In the stackable position (with the lid in the front) I was able to get close to 30 pounds of a 35lbs bag in it without having the dog food spilling out the front whenever the lid is opened.As I am not planning on stacking it or needing to put 40 pounds in it, these problems don't both me that much, but to someone expecting such a claim might be disappointed."
3,At least it does the job!,"I ordered this vault to help keep my puppy's dry food fresh and out of reach of creepy crawlers. I usually purchase a bag of the 35 lb. Nutro Large Breed Puppy and thought that the entire bag would fit into the vault... Wrong! I had to keep 8-10 cups of food in the bag until a couple of feedings passed. Despite not being able to fit a 35 lb. bag of dog food, the vault does seal securely and the slanted neck at the opening is easily accessible for leaving it on the bottom shelf in our dry-storage. And they included a 1-cup scoop with the purchase! Overall, I would consider purchasing another one if the need ever comes about, but will be more cautious with the size that I choose."
4,battle against the ants,"For some reason this year the ants have decided to invade the inside of my house. In years past I spray around the outside foundation of my house and leave the ants alone to pursue their interests outside that perimeter, but for some reason, this year they have decided they want to party inside the house as well. I try not to spray insecticide inside the house. The ants were particularly focused on the bags of dog food and cat food stored in a closet. I had seen these vittle vault containers at Petco, so decided to shop on line for them. The ants are at bay and I saved some money and am very happy with the quality of the vaults. The lids work great and they are made in the USA."
1,I expect better,"Vittles Vault 40-pound stackable? How is it stackable? First, there are no fittings for it to be stackable. When the top container is slightly emptied, it slides around on the bottom container. There should be fittings (feet, indentations to fit into, so that it does not move off one another?!!)that make this stackable! Secondly, when the top container is full, the bottom container lid can not screw on because the weight misshapes the opening! One has to lighten the weight, in order for the opening to go back into shape. The purpose of a 40 lb. container is to hold an abundance of dog food. Third, the lid does not screw on easily and quick, each and every time. There are times that one has to try and try again to get the lid to fit in and start screwing. I am not sending it back because I found shelving that holds the containers seperately. But believe me, I will watch for a better way of storing my dogs' food.Stackable Vittles Vault 40#"
5,Great size and ease of use.,"After researching for a while, this product had the best reviews. This product is exactly what we needed and is well-made."
2,NOT Raccoon proof,"Raccoons were getting into my bird seed, and this container thwarted them...for a month or so. They got it open once, and then it was a buffet on the porch again - no challenge to them at all. So for my purposes, this turns out to have been a useless purchase. What a disappointment."
4,50Lb Vault only fits 32LBs of dog food,50Lb Vault only fits 32LBs of dog food.... Everything else is great.This is the best way to store dog food.
5,Interested in The Templars? Try this one....,"There are many reasons why I am proud to own this book, and I am delighted to find material relating to The Templars (and other Monastic Fighting Orders) in this historical ""expose'"" of Freemasonry. I am also quite happy to finally find a book that mentions ""The Odd Fellows."" The author makes a bold claim, that he will ""Teach Masonry to Masons."" I also thank Amazon.com for their recommendation system, which inspired my girlfriend to send me this one as a surprise! If you are caught-up in the Templar-craze, check-out this historical work and measure fact with fiction. You will not be disappointed."
3,Disappointed,"I guess it depends on what you like, but I expected this to have a bit more of an oxidized look and it is very shiny, which, to me is kind of inconsistent with the style of the design."
5,My toddler loves it and it's very accurate for east-coast ecosystems,"My toddler loves it and it's very accurate for east-coast ecosystems. Has detailed illustrations of native species including mammals, birds, insects, and plants."
5,Perfect fit,They are exactly as they look with color and fit very well. Its a good product and it arrived quickly and on time.
3,Anti-rattle clips on two of four pads,All four of my Nissan Sentra original brake pads had anti-rattle clips on top and bottom. The first two new pads I pulled out of the package had them as well. I installed them on the right side and reinstalled the caliper and wheel. When I pulled out the last two pads there were no anti-rattle clips. I didn't want to backtrack and reinstall the old pads so I pressed on and used the supplied silicone grease on the backs of the two left-side pads to prevent rattling. I broke in the pads per the instructions. They work great. No rattles so far.
1,"Isn't Ceramic, Is Ferro-Carbon Brake Pads","Maybe the pads are good quality, i don't installed yet, but if they sold like ""Ceramic Brake Pads"" and you receive a Ferro-Carbon pads, that's a fraud.That is what i get, the same part number HB268F.665, but Ferro-Carbon pads.so please, put the right description for this product, ferro-carbon pad, no ceramic"
3,Does not work with Infiniti G35 coupe,"Despite Amazon part checker, my trustworthy garage said that those pads would not work with my 2005 Infiniti G35 coupe. I was looking forward to having them on my car, but had to go with another brand of brake pads that would work with my car."
1,another dead wine cooler,"It worked well for a while.Sure it took a couple days to truly cool stuff, but then it totally died days after the warranty.Zero. Nothing. Nada.I'm very sad it was a wedding present with best intentions, and we enjoyed it immensely.Now this ""thing"" is in a Florida landfill.Consider a real refrigerator if you really care about wine temperature.Refridgerators cost more to operate, but failure is rare, even at the low-end. Add up your costs and you will conclude as I have that this technology is unreliable. Search the internet and you will discover many like me.Say no.So sad..."
2,Read the fine print,"I totally agree with the first reviewer. I never thought to check the book's dimensions when ordering. Buyer beware -- I guess -- but I think this should to be listed as a ""pocket"" dictionary right in the title. Suddenly it doesn't seem like I got such a good deal."
2,Not a basic but a 3 inch compact dictionary,"The title is misleading, the basico version of this dictionary is a mini 3 inch book that fits easily in a purse. The compacto version of this book is a full book size dictionary. The product information does not specify size nor content. Very disappointed when I received this mini book with very simple one word definitions and the seller wanted to charge me for the return postage."
5,Watchfreak,"I have always had a thing for watches! I am not rich, so I really can't do Pateks, etc. I have had this watch for over 4 years! I can not kill this watch! I am hard on watches, and this thing is amazing! I haven't even had to do the battery change thing. The coolest thing is, that I had several compliments on this watch. This is a bad little dude! For the money and the coolness, the no maintenance thing, and being indestructable- on my scale this gets COOLEST BUY AWARD!!! Later!"
4,Nice Watch,"I typically buy timex analog w/ dig window for chrono since I exercise quite a bit. This is first with analog chrono. For that purpose I think digital window is better; easier to read.I rated this watch a 4 since I think it looks great; not too ""jewelry"" but a big step up from timex.Like other bracelet styles, its kind of heavy and slides around."
4,good watch,"This is a nice watch, but it came little bigger on my wrist. SO, I had to adjust from local watch shop and cost me 15 bucks more to do so.ANd, during certain month of 29 and 31, the watch gave me wrong date at the start of the month, so I'm adjusting the date every month.Other than that, this watch is very stylish."
3,Take with a grain of salt!,After reading this book I found many things that were not accurate! For example the authors claim to use recorded statics and go on to cite the1850 Census for Benton County Minnesota. They also cite my family in thecensus but they do not cite every person in this family. In the Genealogythey leave out my 3rd Great Grandmother that was in the family census. They further make the same mistakes online at there website. This is ineteresting since they also claim to have decended from the same familyso one could expect them to what to atleast get this correct.
5,Top of the line chess clock.,"I am US Chess Federation candidate master ( current rating 2188) and have been playing casual and competitive chess since I was 7 years old. I have been using pretty much every analog and digital clock which is currently on the market.I consider new chess clock from Saitek : Competition Pro Game Timer to be a top of the line chess timer. It has all the functionality, yet it is economical enough to compete with other brand names like Chronos and DGT. I recommend it to clubs and individuals. It comes with time delay feature which is a must in Major US Chess tournaments (like World Open, Chicago Open, Foxwoods Open,etc.)"
1,Disappointed Item,"This item did not function, it would freeze up after being turned off for an extended time and turned back on. Returned item to Amazon and my refund was returned promptly."
5,good clock,"I am a club player and I used many clocks in my chess games...and I decided to order this one after using it...It is a very good and durable clock, and even the somehow high price for the the technology used, it was the cheapest quality chess clock that I could find available...The settings are not very easy for different times but I mainly play with the same settings 95% of the time, soI do not care much about this.If you do not plan to use Fischer/Bronstein style of Increment you may consider to buy the blue model which is a bit cheaper, and has exactly the same structure/quality (by the way, the silver looks better only because of the color)"
2,Saitek Timer is NOT suitable for official Scrabble tourneys,"I used my Saitek timer at the National Scrabble Championship in Orlando, FL, this year and it was promptly decided by the directors that it was unsuitable for Scrabble tourneys. The reason is that once you start the clock at 00:25 (25 minutes per person is the default start time for Scrabble tournaments), the seconds counter does NOT appear until much later! It immediately starts by showing 00:24. What is really happening is that it has started counting down: 00:24:59, 00:24:58, 00:24:57, etc. but the seconds are NOT displayed on the timer until later when it has counted down down to 20 minutes at which point, it will show 19:59, 19:58, 19:57, 19:56, etc. I have no idea why it behaves this way, but as it is, the Saitek timer is disallowed at official Scrabble tournaments. Sigh!"
3,Arco Clerical Exams,"I'm taking the Civil Service Exam for Library Clerk and some of the exams in this one look similar. I haven't taken the exam yet, so I don't no exactly how helpful this will be"
5,"Designers Edge L-1710 12-Inch Indoor One-Light Downward Farm Light Fixture, Powder Coated","We have an unfinished basement with standard ceramic ceiling sockets. These fixtures add two things; increased light down where I need it without added watts and it really adds a finished look to the lights. The fixture was simple to install as it just screws into a standard light socket, then you screw your bulb into it. It is fairly heavy gauge metal and the fixture appears to have a ceramic socket. I would definitely recommend these to anyone with a basement like mine, or anywhere you have a simple light socket like a garage. Thanks! Kevin"
4,It's good for you who are interested in ESD..,"Recently, I studied the CMOS layout. And I attended at the project about that. I fel the need to know the ESD phenomeon. At that time, I found this book. I understood this phenomenon and the ways to protect it easily. Because the book provided many graphs and photos and it treated the phenomenon in depth relatively. But this book didn't deal with the antenna diode issues. The importance of the antenna diode issues increases. So I hope that the authers will publish new edition.On the whole, I am satisfied with this book."
5,Whitney learned from the best.,"What a wonderful piece.First of all, this songs are amazing. They don't write this kind of songs these days. Every song has a story, it talks directly to you.Second, Cissy's voice. This lady knows how to sing, how to put her heart in every line of a song. That's why it is so beautiful and touching.And last but not least. Whitney. Not yet the Whitney Houston. But Whitney, Cissy's daughter, doing her backing vocals, learning and evolving.These two voices sometimes sound like one, but they have their own colors. And it is beautiful."
5,Spice and Laughs,"I have all three of the series of Two's Company.. I love the fun that these two characters have with one another.. Their banter and repartee is what makes it so much fun.. These two actors are good in their own right, but together they are extra special.. I watch them often and get such a kick out of their play.. I would recommend it to anyone that loves the British humor and a Brassy lady from the stage..Elaine Stritch is still going strong even after all these years.It is nice to see her appear with her late husband playing her cousin in series number two ""A Loving Christmas"". Two's Company has weathered the years nicely... Kudos to all involved..C. F. Marsh"
3,SOG Trident disappointment,"I bought the SOG trident without first seeing it in person and was disappointed. The handle feels weak and it is not well balanced with the blade weight. There is no protective latch or cover for the handle notch use for cutting line so it is very easy to hook it on your pocket and cut your pocket. The opening mechanism is weak. Rather than a spring loaded system, the lock flops around until you fully extend the blade. So, to open the blade, you have to apply the force to get the blade open. Very difficult to open with one hand.On the plus side, the blade is very sharp and durable. At $110, it is a bit to expensive for the quality of the handle."
4,"Good locking knife, slightly awkward controls","There are three controls, one to flip it open, one to unlock it for closing and one one to lock it shut. It's this last one that is rather small, in a normal right handed grip it is under the ball of your thumb, you'd never feel it, but if you need to use it then it's hard to reach. Small as it is it sometimes gets pushed in to the locked position, when you discover this you need to roll it over in your hand so the thumb nail can click it back into the unlocked position. I carry this knife unlocked and it hasn't ever opened unexpectedly.With a little practice the opening becomes very easy, which is perhaps a little disconcerting for anyone watching the blade suddenly appear from a pocket.These things are so light that I don't notice I am carrying it, it clips in to my front right pocket and most people would have no idea it is there.I can't imagine what someone would need to do to this to break it twice in a year."
3,Super Reader,"To continue on with the sporting theme, Superbaby is a book about producing a superior athlete, as well. In this case, a group of scientists does the genetics and gene therapy thing to build a prodigy.The kid they get becomes world chess champion, he is Tiger Woods but at a younger age, and also becomes heavyweight champion of the world. Then, he takes up baseball.As an adult, he has to deal with his own adult problems, and is not that successful."
5,"Mystical images, symbols of the spirit.","Byron's poems range from beautiful clarity in his early works to the mystical, almost eerie in his later ones. I have seen his paintings online and find them well matched by the poems, symbolically. Images stand out: dark birds, angels' wings, rain at night. The other-worldly quality of the collection is a challenge and a pleasure to the reader."
4,Great gift,"My son is obsessed with WWE and this tin is his pride and joy! It came with a lot of cards - I think 75. There aren't more that 2 high value silver or gold cards, but the quantity made up for that.The tin itself he loves and has really made his collection special.As usual Amazon delivery was impeccable!"
2,Do what you gotta do...,"This product really is cheap, I'm glad i didnt pay full price for it from delta. I purchased this to replace a broken on that was allowing water to drip back into the wall and cause damage to the floor below it... I would expect more from delta but its just cheap plastic inside so be careful not to drop or pull up on the lever very hard..."
1,Plastic! I should have read reviews first,"Well, I usually read the other reviews before placing an order but this time I screwed up. I didn't notice the spout was plastic until I received it. The Amazon description said it was metal (bronze). The only metal part is a brass adapter that connects the spout to your pipe. The spout looks nice but it feels cheap and sounds cheap when you bump/tap it. After reading the issues the other reviewers had I decided to return it.Delta seems to have slipped into the ""economy"" class of fixtures. I returned it and re-ordered a Moen 3857ORB Tub Spout (It wasn't that much more). I called Moen and they verified it was metal. I haven't received it yet."
1,Didn't last long,I thought it is a genuine part for $50 spout but it only worked 3 months and the diverter does not response to shower. I had to buy since my whole trim is bronze to match same type.
2,Just not as much fun as I had hoped,"I've no specific complaints about the game, it was pretty much as expected, and being able (since I was MUCH younger) to distinguish ""play"" from ""reality"", I had no problem with the mayhem filled subject matter. I'm a big fan of ""First Person Shooters"", and tho' I am also a decent real life sports shooter (you know, with REAL firearms) myself, I've never been tempted - by a computer game at least - to go out and do violence.But honestly, this game wasn't all that thrilling for me. I remember the thrill when I first got my Motor Vehicle Operator's Permit, but now - some years later - driving has for the most part become just a chore to get done with as little trouble as possible.And I'm not even considering buying a Minivan yet....Somebody else might find this game a lot of fun - just not me.The game did laod and run fine with no special PC upgrades. Sometimes that's the biggest problem.Maybe I'll give it another try in a year or so. Or not."
5,Great Fun!,"This CD was well worth the wait! It contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years. I took one of the CDs out of the box, put it in the player, and within minutes my wife and I were dancing. The sound quality, in my judgment is solid, the packaging is fun and creative, and the booklet containing the Cameo Parkway ""story"" was an interesting read. There will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included, but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era. What great fun to hear the Orlons, Chubby Checker, The Tymes, The Dovells, Bobby Rydell, and Dee Dee Sharp once again."
2,Nice to have these out on disk and not bootlegged BUT!!!!,"The Selection was great, the book was put together very well.BUTNot one review talked about this so I'm assuming not to many people have listened to these disks closely on a good set of headphones. there is not one single track that does not reek of distortion. I find it very hard to believe that the first generation or even the second generation tapes would be this bad. I have heard Bootlegs which were taken fron albums sound far better than these. I know I have heard better masters for the Kinks, Sound Orchestral and The Ivy League. What happened? Fans have been waiting for these for a very long time and this is the best ABKCO could do. For those who want to know how bad. Take a 45 RPM only cheap record player from the 60's with a penny on the tone arm so it won't skip, take a worn out 45 turn up the volume all the way and you got it. All that's missing is the scratches."
4,cameo-parkway,"I ordered this mostly for the Bobby Rydell songs as it was the only place I could find his top hits together. I'm enjoying the entire complilation but not as much as I'd hoped. The sound quality is excellent but the content, for the most part, is much more doo wop than I prefer. If you are looking for those more obscure songs from the late fifties, this is the collection for you."
3,Cameo-Parkway,"it is a relief that these recordings are being officialy released after so many years, but there are some rarer sides that should be given a official release(a bunch of doo wop rareities unoficially released)...so hopefully there will be a second box set called ""Cameo-Parkway Sixties rareities""...but for the average sixties fan, you will be pleased with just this."
3,good info,"the book has good information and is very throrough, but chapters are wordy and could probably be condensed. overall, the book is of good quality."
2,Difficult to read,"This book is extremely challenging to get through and understand. I was lost a great deal of the time and did not learn what I had hoped. I appreciate the inclusion of the spiritual aspects of theories in the book, but the authors seemed to forget about teaching in an understandable manner."
2,Pretentiously written and difficult to understand,"As a person with a reputation for using ""big words"" amongst my family and friends, I found this textbook to be unnecessarily difficult to understand. The authors tend to be biased toward certain theorists and theories instead of presenting the material objectively, and some chapters seemed to piece together strings of quotes from other authors (I don't know about you, but that's what I do when I'm not quite sure I'm grasping something). The chapter on phenomenology in particular was EXTREMELY difficult to understand what the authors were saying. I have my BA in Psychology and have been exposed to some of the theories presented in the textbook, so it was easier for me to understand certain chapters better than others, but without my previous training I would have struggled with those chapters as well. The structure and topics covered were good, just not written to be student-friendly. My 5 MSW classmates agree."
3,Reads like a Master's level text,"I am an undergraduate social work student who had to purchase this book for HBSE class. I did not like this book. It was difficult to understand, it seemed more like a Graduate School read. Most of the people in class did not like the book and our professor did not rely heavily on the material. For once, I was glad that we were using two different books in class. The time that the teacher did use material from the book, I had to go to the library to do additional research to put the pieces together so to speak. If you are a undergraduate student, find another book to understand social work theories and perspectives."
4,Good Story,"I love werewolf novels. This was a very good story. I enjoyed the various characters. Athena was crippled at an early age. Her family is very powerful. She lives with her brother and her life has been very sheltered as a society hostess. Morgan Holt is a werewolf who was convicted for the killing of his father. Once he left prison he deserted mankind and traveled with the wolves. One day he is badly hurt and changes into a man and collapses in front of a circus. The circus people, meeting another ""outcast"", take Morgan in. Morgan decides to stay with the circus because he owes it to them, and they need his help to earn enough money to support them through the winter. Athena's brother just happens to meet the circus, and then Athena meets Morgan. This story is pretty much about Morgan and Athena's growing relationship and how she will have to learn how to let her fear go, and Morgan will have to learn how to love and trust again. Very good story."
5,Great book!,"This book was a great opener for the first day of Kindergarten. The children were engaged, talking about the things we did the same at our school. Loved it!"
2,Took too long,I ordered this book with several other books from various vendors. I am a teacher and wanted it for the first day of school. I received all of the other books a good week before I received this book and needless to say I didn't receive it by the first day of school. I went out and bought another copy.
1,let down again,"I was disappointed with Distant Mirrors, and this CD does not do much for me , either. It lacks originality."
2,From a flutist,"I do like it that Ms. Larson plays on a great deal of different flutes. I wish more people would do that. But the down thing is that on her ""Vocalise"" her playing so much of the time sounds like A Sax! How does she do that?! I would not want my flute students to get that kind of sound in their ear. I have them pick up Elaine Shaffer, Paula Robison, Alexa Still and Katherine Kemler. That is real flute playing! I don't mean to be insulting, but this is what I hear."
1,dangerous...,"I gave it to my 2 year old son and he went nuts. I thought it was really great but then he went around going ...""Boom,Boom"". It scared me. Sorry wish it was better"
3,A nice book,The two main characters were very likable and the romance was good. The problem with this book was the plot. It took waaaay to long to get to a trial that didn't take place. Their was way to many subplots that didn't have any real development. The ending was very lackluster in fact the ending was more for the first book than than this one. If you haven't read the first won or loved the first one than you will love this book. I believe the author will have to develop another book to tell the story of Tangi and Steele because it felt like the story was incomplete.
1,Stopped working for no reason!,I used it sporadically for about a year and rarely travelled with it.Now it won't read any of my DVD's.That is $300 I could have spent towards a better brand.
3,Weak magnet/small loading hole,It's exactly what I really wanted for looks and size - but the magnet inside the rim is really weak and the opening quite small.
3,fine product,The product is as described by the seller. It looks nice. But I wish the magnet is stronger.
3,Whats Missing,"The analysis is very detailed on a conceptual basis, not a technical one. Its promise to use Wal Marts modeling as a primary example is only partially met and that is very disappointing."
2,Disappointingly Shallow,"This is a technically light and highly subjective book, which gives no real depth on any aspect of establishing a substantial data warehouse. All the buzzword boxes are ticked, all the subject areas touched upon, but that's about all."
3,"Interesting content, difficult read.",As a martial arts student I am facinated by this topic and make a willing audience. I purchased this book as a present for my instructors and have read it myself.Although we all enjoyed the content and found it facinating we all found the book difficult to read. It requires knowledge of literature and politics from the period in which it was written and the explanations are not as straight forward as other works on this topic.I think it is a good book to read to gain an understanding of the code of behaviour embraced by the Samari and the reasoning behind it but only if you are prepared to persist through the more difficult parts of the book.
1,good LUCK if you are trying to download from Broderbund!,"I'll never know if I like this software or not. Technology/downloadable software,etc... should be a one-click experience not 3+ futile hours of your life you will never get back. 4 emails, 2 password resets, numerous phone calls all in the span of 3 hours with nothing to show for it but a 10 day wait for my refund. Oh, and a destroyed house where the kids were keeping themselves 'occupied' while I obsessed over this ridiculous foray into the technological glitch that is the Broderbund Website/SmartApp/Customer Service Department."
2,Cheap copy,"The disk arrived in a plastic box used for CD's-- not a regular package. The installation directons, printed on the disk itself, state that auto-run will begin when the disk is inserted in the disk drive. Nothing happened and I had to use My Computer and the Setup.exe file to start the installation. About halfway thru the process, it stopped and would not restart. Our son (a computer guy) said the disk is a standard cheap copy type that we can purchase anywhere-- not the usual higher quality that Broderbund would use. Finally we got it installed on the main computer but it would not install on my laptop. I guess it's true-- you get what you pay for. This was cheap enough and that's good. If I have any more problems, I will return it to Amazon."
4,Good books,Good the kids love em would recommend this product glad I bought them. Good good good good easy book for the kids
2,Not for beginner readers,The purpose of phonics readers is to teach kids to read. But these books use far too many complicated words. Kids who are just learning will only get frustrated trying to read these. And kids who are stronger readers will enjoy longer books with better stories.
4,Next step.,"Great stories! Zoinks, this book isn't perfect but like Scoob stories are really fun to read. This is a set for kids reading at a level between the beginning phonics books and chapter books. I recommend the ""Now I'm Reading"" books for beginners. If you purchased this set thinking it was for beginners hold on to them. In a few months your kids will love them."
4,Good starters,"These books are great books to practice sight words and introduce new words and blends. The are not overly creative, but they hold the attention of a 6.5 year old long enough to practice skills."
1,"nice outside, cheap, poor quality inside","I rec'd one of these as a gift. The motor ran for maybe 10 minutes, then went dead. I replaced batteries, to no avail. In this case the giver lost the receipt so had the choice of tossing it or trying to fix it. I opened it up to see if it could be fixed. I was appalled at the poor quality electronics inside. A cold solder connection was the culprit in this case, but the wires soldered were barely touching, then globs of glue were slathered over the wires and components to cover this up and attempt to hold it together. Also, the unit runs only on 2 C batteries, no AC adpator. You are better off getting a hand-cranked manual sorter, or spending a bit more for something better. Avoid this product and this company. Note they sell this same thing at Brookstone for $50, what a rip-off. Beautiful wood finish does not a premium item make."
4,Ridge 8003 is a great boot,"I work part time for the sheriff's department in the courthouse. I am standing much of my shift. These boots have been great. Before this model I wore the 8002 which was the old version. The zipper on these is great as well, quick on and out the door. I have had no problems with the zipper coming down. I cannot speak about the polish, I keep a cheap instant on black polish for when I scuff them up. Overall, a great boot for the money. You can also get it in the 8003-ST which is steel toe model."
1,Terrible,"I work for a DOE contractor that supplies all our duty gear and they just went to these boots. The first problem is that the don't hold boot polish, it flakes of. Whether a brush on or spit shin, after a day it all flakes off. I've spent more time putting an awesome spit shin on and they flake...drives me nuts. The BIGGEST problem with these boots is I'm constantly pulling the zipper back up. Sometimes I'm walking around and the boot flops right off. I'm back to wearing a pair of Danners."
2,Sea Hunt Volunm 1 &2,"I purchased both volumns i and 2 of Seahunt. The quality of picture is good--that is when the DVD is playing like is supposed to; freeze-ups were consistent on almost everyone of these DVDs. Hardly none would play all way through without freezing up. I was very disgusted. I have never purchased a series of DVDs that I had this kind of trouble. ISea Hunt, Volume 1do not recommend the product."
2,*shrug* Could have been worse.,"This thing is HUGE. The case itself measures 10cm in diameter and 34cm tall, don't let the picture fool you into thinking this set is portable. The case without all the internal bits is quite heavy, as the lid is metal plated. Also, this is NOT an 89 piece set, the label on the product states clearly that it's only a 43 piece set. Overall, the product is acceptable, but the product information should be more clear about what you're getting yourself into."
2,Disappointed,"Bought two of these, one for my son and one for my husband. I was VERY disappointed with the size (I should have read more carefully the full size of product). It's ok for a novely item but really not worth the price."
1,This book kills alcoholics,"If youre a hard drinker looking for tips and tricks to stop drinking this book is great. But if you are an alcoholic and looking for a solution in this book, you will most likely die drunk."
4,Living Sober,This book was a suggestion of a friend. Very informative. Very insightful and soothing. Would recommend it to anyone with an addiction.
5,Excellent transaction,I recieved the book in the exact condition it was described to be in and was very satisfied. It arrived on time and I would definately use this seller again
5,Comfort and information at last,"I am so thankful to the author for writing this book. I finally have information that does tell me ""I'm not crazy"" and informs me way beyond what I had hoped on the problem. I feel I can live with my situation now and have hopes for some life for myself without the constant absorption of someone else's situation. Plus I can be more understanding with the affected person because I have a better understanding of how things happen and happened."
5,Don't always listen to the critics!,"If I had listened to the critics I would never have had the chance to read this wonderful trilogy. No, it's not the Shannara series and no, it's not the beautiful Magic Kingdom For Sale - Sold! series but it is still excellent in my opinion. It was exciting and very easy to picture everything he wrote about. And if you don't like a story that sounds much the same as the prequel (sp?) before it, give it a rest and read another author completely, than go back and read the next one in the series. I have loved the first two in this series even better than I did the first time some years ago and I'm sure I'll feel the same about the third one when I read that again."
3,"OK, but not up to his ""SHANNARA"" or ""MAGIC KINGDOM"" series","I enjoyed this book but was a little dissappointed after having read all of his ""SHANNARA"" and ""MAGIC KINGDOM"" series. The hero seems to be a reluctant one at best and the story-line is a little obscure. It seems as though there should have been a book before this one which created the setting. I also felt that too much of the book was devoted to the mundane and not enough to the main plot line. In short, this book (and I am sure those to come) remind me too much of Steven R. Donaldson's ""The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant"" series - I wasn't that wild about those either. Come on Terry, how about so more ""SHANNARA"" stuff!"
5,A great example of what fantasy writing has evolved into.,A great novel protraying a complex and awesome world of fantasy that takes place and evolves smoothly thoroughout the novel and brings you to suprising conclusions and graphic endings. It reall y is a great example of what fantasy writing has evolved into since to Lord of the Rings. An overall great novel.
4,What this book is about.,"Sinnissippi Park, in Hopewell, Illinois, has long hidden a mysterious evil, locked away from humankind by powers greater than most could even imagine. But now the malevolent creatures that normally skulk in the shadows of the park grow bolder, and old secrets hint at a violent explosion. The brewing conflic draws John Ross to Hopewell. A Knight of the Word, Ross is plagued by nightmares that tell him someone evil is coming to unleash an ancient horro upon the world. Caught between them is fourtenn-year-olf Nest Freemark, who senses that something is terribly wrong but has not yet learned to wield the budding power that sets her apart from her friends. Now the future of humanity depends upon a man haunted by his dreams and a gifted young girl--twos souls who will discover what survives when hope and innocence are shattered forever..."
4,A great new mythos,"Brook's portraits of his characters here are superb. Especially wonderfully drawn is the Knight, which shatters any other book's misconceptions about who and what a Knight could be. Wonderful"
1,An utter waste of time and paper,"Terry Brooks' only brilliant move was glomming on to the popularity of Tolkein's works before anyone else did. Recently I decided to try any book that didn't have ""Shannara"" in the title just to see if perhaps he had an original thought of his own. [He doesn't--this is a bad melding of THE GOLDEN COMPASS and WATCHERS.] It shows the same limited vision and writing ability that his earlier works demonstrate. I tried to like it, I really did. Bottom line: The book was awful."
4,Good introduction to the fantasy genere,Buying the book at a discount store and mistaking it's title for a horror book i started reading with no real expectations. However as the story started to unfold I started adapting myself to the fantasy genre and let myself relax and like the book. Although it took quite a while to identify with the characters once past the first section of the book the person characteristics start standing out. I especially liked Pick's character and sympathised with the granny. I'm really pleased at having read this book and as soon as i get some spare money I'll get a couple of other fantasy books maybe the more acclaimed ones by the same author.
3,Reminds me very much of Clifford Simak's writings,"The combination of a folksy, small town setting along with magic, sorcery, and demons reminds me of the novels of Clifford Simak. The book has frantic, non-stop action, but like Brooks' Shannara books, it's not especially original. I did enjoy it, and it would be great reading on a plane. The sequel is already out."
5,Bravo Brooks!,"Having read other demon inspired stories, such as Steven King stuff, I can say I really liked this story. In fact I noticed that one of the character's name is Derry and in the ""Knight of the Word"" there's major references to the Wizard of Oz, just like in DT4...probably just a coincidence or is it a very, very subtle nod to King? Anyways, on to the book review. It's a cool mix of fantasy and neo apocalytptic threats, which makes it extra interesting.I really liked how Brooks makes all the characters seem human. Some critics complain about how the characters complain.... but that's often how life is. You aren't exactly satisfied where it's going or you aren't sure if you can fit in and you wonder how you can make it all work out. This book does a good job dealing with these issues and I love all the characters in this book because they aren't perfect and don't strive to be stereotypical heroes."
3,Not as Good as His Fantasy Works IMO,Terry Brooks is one of my favorite authors and this was a solid book but I did not find it to be as enjoyable as his fantasy series books. The characters were very good but the book is pretty slow in several sections.
5,Running with Terry,"Bought this book in the drugstore - no category given, but the name was intriguing. Have been dining on romances for the past few years and have just about had my fill. Have worked through a few mysteries - Carol O'Connell is wonderful. But,this was definitely something different - it was fascinating! Extremely well written, vivid characters and scenes. I am ordering ""Knight of the Word"" today. Might edge my way into the ""Shannara"" series and run all the way with Terry."
3,10? Are you joking?,"You folks throw ""10s"" around like they were dimes. If Running with the Demon is a ""10,"" then we need to add zero or two to the rating scale. It was OK, I guess. My ""5"" is generous, but then I'm in a good mood right now. The demon in the book is a nitwit. Stories are driven by their villains and this one's a loser. The knight is a whiney drip. Nest is fine, her friends are retards. I wanted to throw Pick in the microwave. Gran is pretty cool: at least her character develops. Grandpa's a stiff. Running With the Demon is nothing new. Buy it, if you must."
4,"Not my favorite Brooks series, but the guy's still a genius.","Okay, Running with the Demon was Brooks' attempt of making a fantasy-type story in modern times and in an actual location. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great either, but it's not my personal favorite. It's dark. (That's not the reason why I didn't like it as well as his SHANNARA series, but for the sake of saying so, it's dark.) The thing that's memorable about this is that is suggests and basically fantasizes that maybe there are some people with magical powers in a REAL world. Well, anyways. I didn't toally expect Brooks to understand a teenager (that's the main character, Nest) but it wasn't as bad as I'd thought it might turn out to be. The only reason I ever read this in the first place was because I love Brook's writing. I did give it 4 stars, though. What can I say, a good read but.. the SHANNARA novels are better."
5,"I Live Near ""Hopewell""","Hopewell Illinois is actually a fictional name for Sterling, Illinois, which is the town where Terry Brooks was born. I found Running With the Demon to be a fascinating novel. The book kept me on the edge of my seat, and I couldn't put it down. I am familiar with the real Sinissippi park, and I especially liked all the action that took place there. It is a very large park, so its easy to see how Nest, Pick, John, and the others found adventure there. Mr. Brooks has a way of storytelling that creates vivid images in the reader's mind. This makes the story more enjoyable. The characters truly come to life, and you can actually feel their emotions."
3,Mediocre in the beginning...speed at the end,"I trudged through the first half of the book, praying that something interesting would happen...FINALLY! And then, happily, it did. The stories pace picked up and the characters personalities began to meld and come together. I found some of the plot development a little bit weak, such as the grandmother and Wraith combination at the end (seemed convenient to the story)and that Nest was able to use her powers to help heal the kid in the very end (when all she could do was destroy the feeders throughout the book). But the book was 'entertaining' and the characters you came to care about (slightly). I doubt, however, if I'll read the next book in the series. Just didn't grab me that much. Not like Dune or Lord of The Rings or Foundation."
4,Not what I remembered,"I read this about 15 or 20 years ago. I'm glad I'm rereading it now that it's the start of the whole Word/Void/Shannarra series. I don't remember ANY of the plot or events int he book. It's great knowing where all this is heading. I DO recall thinking ""Hmm... this would make a good prequel"". Well there you go."
3,Almost Liked It,"Simply put, two out of the three main characters make the book very interesting to read, meanwhile one of the main characters is quite dull. The demon and the demon chaser provide a classic battle that I enjoy in Brooks' other books. Typical flawed characters that attempt to transcend themselves or embrace the dark side, yet Terry unique. The young girl around which the story revolves is too young, weak, and boring for an adult reader. Brooks usually takes the young characters out of their home to journey (of course many other authors too). In this book the young girl never leaves the small sleepy town and is probably why her character sucks."
2,A sad new start,"The Shannara series was the first series I *ever* stayed with. I commented to friends how wonderful it was and drew them into the mystery. The ""First King..."" was an excellent work and I wish Terry would continue filling in some of the gaps of Shannara....(What ever happened to Shea's parents, Amberle's? The meeting of the Highlander and Shea?) I even met Mr. Brooks while on a business trip to Philadelphia. But I must say that I was disappointed by the book and will not continue reading the ""The Demon"" series. 'Nuf Said."
2,The Worst Terry Brooks Book Ever!,"I thought that this book was terrible. The story line was so predictable. I knew what was going to happen all through the book. The characters were stick figures. They had no depth, color or interest. I have read five other Terry Brooks books and thought they were all pretty good. But I keep wanting to leave this book on a park bench. What a waste of reading time. The only reason I finished the book was because I was on an airplane with nothing else to read. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,"Another good read, but stick to Shanara","I'm a devout follower of Brooks, having read all of his books while considering him the best of his kind since Tolkien. And this was a strong contemporary story that I devoured during a crosscountry flight. However, Terry, if you see this, stay with your Shanara format. I can read contemporary stories like this anywhere, but only you can follow Tolkien's enchanting stories."
2,Didn't get cover image,"I'm disappointed the publisher didn't feel including the cover image for the Kindle was necessary. All you get is a generic picture of the publisher's logo, not what's shown on the product page. I've contacted customer service but could not resolve this problem. This is not the first book I've purchased from the publisher that didn't include any cover art. Very disappointed."
3,Super Reader,"John Ross is a Knight of the Word, doomed to opposed the forces of the Void, with only his staff for comfort. His dreams are a test, every night, of what may come if he abuses his power, leading to a post-apocalyptic demons eat humans horror world.Nest Freemark is a teenager, and the women in her family have a special magical heritage and are able to talk to, and see some of the supernatural entities surrounding their decaying small town. She opposes the demons in her own way."
1,Disappointing,"It's been years since I last read his books. I couldn't remember the story but I did remember enjoying them immensely. However, Running with the Demon is really weak. I had difficulty identifying one character from the next.I don't think the book even deserved to be call a fantasy novel. I am inclined to belive that the Freemark women suffered from a hereditary mental problem and imagined all those feeders.Frankly, who would want to be a Knight of the Word if all he gets are nightmares and nothing else. At least the Knight of Solamnia (Dragonlance) have their glory days before. This Knight of the Word is one big loser."
2,I'm confused,"I don't understand this book. John Ross dreams about a horrible future every time he falls asleep, a future that will happen if he doesn't stop it from happening. He's suppose to stop the Demon from getting to 14 year old Nest Freemark. But the Demon was never going to get to Nest because her grandmother had already taken care of things. The horrific, end-of-the-world future was never going to happen in the first place because of grandma! This book would have turned out EXACTLY the same without John Ross. Such a wimpy hero!!! I'm just surprised that more people don't find this fact really annoying."
3,Just so-so...,"While I think that the overall plot was okay, there was just something missing. The story in general was very predictable almost from the first chapter on. Brooks also has a tendency to restate the same thing over and over...i.e. every character cocks their eyebrow at least one time if not more. The characters themselves were alright. Nest and John Ross were well done, but it was also a bit aggravating and unbelieveable that someone could grow up knowing nothing about their parents, all the while realizing that their grandparents are keeping secrets from them, and not explode emotionally. I did finish the book, I must say I had to, even though all that I thought would happen, did happen. It was not a horrible read, just predictable and a bit lacking in suspense."
1,Predictable,"If the author had the ability to make the journey enjoyable, this book's utter predictability would have been less problematic. As it is, the book has a flatness that derives partly from the fact that it's all been done before, and done better. Terry Brooks has ventured deeply into Stephen King territory here, practically duplicating the plot of one of King's novels. Brooks fails to provide suspense, unpredictability, or interesting characters. His characters' magical abilities and his descriptions of their use fail to evoke the slightest sense of wonder; they might as well be mechanics describing the repair of a carburetor. There are long descriptive passages that are dully written and don't advance the plot or tell us anything we need to know. They are padding, and it shows. For the undiscriminating only."
2,Not Terry Brooks best work,I am a great admirer of Mr. Brooks. I loved every issue of the Shannara books. Unfortunatly Running with the demon temporarily put me off of Brooks. The book was extremley slow. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. It finally did in the last two chapters. I am almost scared to read his new one.
2,A major disappointment !,"As a devoted fan of Terry Brooks, I was looking forward to reading his latest novel, in spite of the somewhat mixed reviews that it had been given. I was quite disappointed with the novel, and found myself skipping pages while only half way through. I finally gave up and skipped to the last chapter. No surprises there. Unlike all of his earlier works, this book dragged on, lacking the character development and fast moving pace of everything he has previously written. The ending was obvious from the half way mark, and the plot became tedious. In the mean time, I plan on re-reading all of his earlier novels, safe in the knowledge of how outstanding they all are. I hope he resumes writing in his original style, and do look forward to his next novel."
2,Running with the Demon is The Stand Lite,"Brooks has made an industry out of borrowing others: first Tolkien and now Stephen King. Basically, Demon is The Stand Lite (it's got the Walking Man demon and unwilling knightly hero and manipulated villains and the threat of a post-apocalyptic age of darkness and pseudo-religious overtones). The writing is competent, the characters are cardboard (except for the well-crafted Gran), the story is flat and predictable. Good v evil is sooooo very tired. The teenagers are laughable. Brooks, how many teenagers do you know who talk like these stiffs? Give it a pass."
2,Been There-Done That,"Is it that difficult to break the mold?? Well, it shouldn't be. Sorry, but I get angry when an author assumes that the audience is so dim witted as to not recognize the same basic story over and over and over again. I think I must be dim witted though, because I bought this book and now I have Mr. Brooks and many of his compatriots to blame for my condition!"
2,Bromidic Sermons,"A good casual read, but lacks the depth suggested from the other reviews. More enrichment can be found in Charles R. Swindoll's book on the same subject ""The Bride"" written two years earlier. Maybe ""Many of today's believers jump from one congregation to another"" in search of guidance less trite. Probably why you can buy this book new for 39 cents."
5,One of the Best,"First heard this on cassette in 1995 in Romania. Great lyrics and singing. Chris Norman is very little heard of in America, which is a shame. Recommend this CD for all ages. Have purchased a used CD through Amazon."
5,At long last! A super map holder,"I had searched all summer for a good map holder and finally found one on Amazon.com. It's just the right size for a quarter-size 8/5 x 11-inch cue sheet; plus it's waterproof with the opening at the bottom. Clear, durable plastic for easy readability and strong velcro straps that attach to the handle bars. Love it!"
5,Works As Advertised! Even in Monsoons,"I bought it for a century ride in the New York Finger lakes region with over 6,000 feet of climb. What I also got was 7 hours of constant and often torrential downpour and 30-40 mph wind gusts! The bar map cover kept my cue sheet dry through the whole character building experience, and given the conditions, the directions were essential to surviving the 105 miles. The Velcro seal works. Great job."
4,Great cue sheet holder,"I have been using it for the last few months and I am quite satisfied. Major issue is that I have a GPS, and jot is not ideal to have both. But I put it upside down and it does the job for me."
2,Below Average Characterization,Slow moving book. This is a psuedonym for Chelsea Quinn Yarbro of the St. Germaine books.
3,Give me Sherlock; this book was a disappointment,"All in all, this book was a big disappointment! I liked the idea of a story about Sherlock's smarter brother, but I found the story unengrossing and the characters ultimately uninteresting."
4,A start,With 35 recipies this is more of a book aimed at people wanting to start cooking in a Japanese style rather than an in-depth cookery book. It is somewhat in the chatty style ofFrench Women Don't Get Fat: The Secret of Eating For Pleasureand has a lot of the flaws of that book. However if you're looking for a different style of cookery to maybe start controling your portions this probably isn't a bad start.The concept of eating small and if you need more going back to the bowl is something that a lot of people (including me) need to work into our lives. I found that there wasn't quite enough variety for me but it did make me consider finding more Japanese recipe books to use it to jar me out of my complacency.It tries to cajole rather than force change and sometimes engages in some hyperbole but it's interesting and does make you consider how to make changes to improve your life.
1,Not very informative,"More of a biography of the writer and her family. A few recipes. We all know eat fich, lots of veggies, seaweed is good and eat in moderation. Boring uniformative book- I skimmed it in less than 20 minutes.There are many much more informative books out there with better recipes. I could get these recipes form a recipe website a lot cheaper ."
2,not as expected,I thought this book would share secrets to health & longevity by the practices of Japanese women. It is basically a cook book and not a good one at that. I couldn't even finish it. Mostly the author reminisces about her childhood diet.
4,Interesting but somewhat obvious,"I'm not sure what I was expecting. On the one hand it's interesting to read her comments on her own experiences having changed cultures and lived in both Japan and the USA. On the other hand, the entire book can be summed up as: eat more rice and fish, preferably with Japanese seasonings.So if your just looking for some light reading on the musings of a Japanese woman living abroad, you'll enjoy this. But don't expect any magic secrets here on weight loss.Though if you have no clue what constitutes Japanese seasonings, I suppose some of her lists might be of additional value to you."
3,Not meant for serious chefs,"This book has fine dieting advice (small portions, lots of veggies and complex carbs), and is a fun read. That being said, the recipes are not as advertised. Use the recipes and advice in this book for inspiration, and then find recipes to USE elsewhere."
3,I love the title of this book,"Do Japanese women get old or fat? Well they do get old after a long time. They don't get fat but they have been known to get a little chubby. Do French women get fat? No (because they don't eat) but they do get old. One reviewer asked what's next? Italian women? Actually I think Italian women do get fat. These books are great for learning about a culture through it cuisine and like I said, I can't leave the title alone!!! Just remember, the moral of the story is don't eat like a pig, don't eat a lot of fast food...and move around some."
1,Shallow Book,"The author offers a one-dimensional opinion as to why Japanese women are thin. The traditional Japanese diet is only part of the answer. Cultural pressures in Japan to be thin are overwhelming. If you live in Japan and gain so much as one kilogram, you'll hear about it before the needle on your scale can even register it. Both men and women watch every bite of food a woman eats in public. At the workplace eyes will roll knowingly if a woman eats four small rice balls for lunch. Conversely, women are chided or quized about ""being on a diet"" if they consume only two rice balls. The incidents of eating disorders is skyrocketing in Japan. Underlying everything is a feeling of superiority about being thinner and more youthful than people of other countries and cultures. Witness the title of the book itself. The title alone rates a zero in my mind."
5,This is such a great book.,"Lots of valuable information, and recipes using easy to obtain ingredients. I'm looking forward to trying them all."
3,Interesting Way To Lose Weight,"* Lots of new information on how to lose weight* Yum dishes and easy to make* Love the part about walking 10,000 steps a day - I believe it has helped me!* The 'Country Power Breakfast' has been a great success in our family.* Now I understand why it's so rare to see an overweight Japanese. Howabout others from Asia? How do they stay slim?"
3,Jumping on the trend bandwagon,"This book offered some good nutritional advice, especially about eating until you're ""80 percent"" full. I also enjoyed learning about Japanese attitudes toward food presentation, freshness, and everyday exercise.The recipes do look delicious, although I'm not sure how easy it would be to adopt a Japanese diet exclusively. It seems a bit daunting to use some of the ingredients she discusses.All in all, I found this book's content interesting, but the title and format are very unoriginal. It is almost identical to ""French Women Don't Get Fat."" Same type of story: author moves to the U.S., gains weight, returns home to horrified relatives, loses weight, reclaims her cultural wisdom. As a well-known ad agency in Texas is known to say, ""Imitation is the sincerest form of a lack of imagination."""
3,Buy the French book instead,"This book was... okay. The writing style tends to be a bit text-booky; the author probably could have gotten the same points across in half the amount of pages. There are some interesting bits of history and some anecdotes, as well as plenty of healthy Japanese recipes, but I didn't really learn much about living a healthy lifestyle. Instead, I suggest buying French Women Don't Get Fat by Mireille Guiliano, which is a beautifully written and inspirational book that will keep you intrigued and make you want to change the way you live your life."
2,"Oh, please. The Frenchwoman did it better!","As another reviewer said, this is a total ripoff of ""French Women Don't Get Fat,"" only with seaweed, dried fish flakes and soy instead of apple tart, vegetable soup with pesto, etc. (Which would YOU rather eat?) I can't imagine eating fish, tofu and/or seaweed for breakfast, no matter how healthy and slimming it might be. Every single recipe calls for at least one ingredient that I wouldn't have a CLUE how to find -- and frankly, not one recipe appealed to me. All the stuff about how bad the American diet is, is true -- but come on, we've heard it before. I am giving it 2 stars only to be nice, and because I'm not particularly a Japanese food fan in the first place, so I figure I'm slightly biased."
5,Enjoyable,Ms. Moriyama takes reader into her childhood and the healthly Japanese lifestyle during the first half of her book. The second half offers readers how to add just small amounts of healthy foods into thier western eating habits without starving in the process. I enjoyed reading this book- a good tip I picked up was to add brown rice to meals- even my kids like rather than some other startchy veggies.Very good tips on brewing green tea as well.Recommend for someone wanting to add something different to thier diets.
3,Informative,"This was informative, but not exactly practical. Naomi often talked about how easy it is to do these recipes, but unless you live near an Asian market or can afford insane shipping prices, you're out of luck(like I am, the closest thing I have to Asian food around here is a small section in Target).This book would have done a lot better with pictures. Not just because I'm a visual person, but hearing her try to describe a food item I've never heard of is just hard to imagine. Pictures with the recipes would have helped too.I did learn a bit though, things like how Japanese meals are prepared(separate dishes for each item rather than all on one plate like we do), and what are common ingredients(like tofu).This book is more suited for those that can cook and live near Asian markets. Sadly the only thing I've really cooked is Hamburger Helper, so the instructions in this were very confusing and overwhelming."
4,Japanese Woman Don't get Old or Fat,Although some of the writing seemed sophmoric I felt that the general idea was a good one. It is fun to try to cook healthier and incorporate one's love for japanese foods. The recipes are not difficult however finding some of the ingredients are a challange. Sometimes it is easier to buy ingredients online-like the rice oil instead of trying to run all over town. We can all use a little help in changing our daily diets. The book is also an easy read.
1,Useless,"This book is not worth the money. The only useful advice it gives for losing weight and staying young are common sense things that you can find anywhere: don't over-eat; exercise regularly; watch what you eat, etc. Everything else is just the author saying how much better her family and her country do things than any other country. Even some of the Japanese recipes (the scrambled eggs and steak breakfast recipe) are actually western meals with added Japanese flavor (soy sauce). I would say, don't waste your money. Just buy a Japanese cookbook, don't over-eat, exercise, eat a variety of foods and lots of vegetables, and wash your face regularly."
3,Mostly Self-Promotion,"I put this book out for a garage sale recently, because after reading it once, I found no reason to keep it. I have other Japanese cookbooks that have the same recipes. I have other books that give more information about Japanese culture and culinary history. The book is mostly self-promotion with very few recipes."
1,Hate to tell you this but..........,"I am currently living in Japan as an expat and have been here for 10 months ( 2 more years to go). Japanese women have very high metabolisums and eat twice as much as we do, all of the expats here currently have gained at least 10 lbs( at least all of the ones that we know). Eating like the Japanese is not a diet or a weight loss plan, they eat allot. Please keep in mind that in Japan many people walk instead of drive so they are always on the go, it is much easier to walk most places and if you take a train of course you are still looking at tons of walking.Also if you like beer, it is heavy and has more calories than American brews.This is not a diet trust me!!"
1,Not true,"Can I just say that Japanese women do get old , and not as fat as in other countries, but they do not sustain the figure of their youth. Immediately after marriage and after the desired number kids they usual turn into a obasan. Live life as it happens, and accept what you are."
1,BORING,A WASTE OF JUDI DENCH'S TALENTS. WE COULD NOT GET THROUGH THE WHOLE SERIES.I CANNOT EVEN GET RID OF IT ON AMAZON. SAVE YOUR MONEY.READ A BOOK.
5,great,THis one little book is going to be a very big help for me when I need to do my concept maps for nursing school
3,last of the Rock Stars ~ Ronnie Spector,"Since ""Be My Baby"" I have loved Ronnie Spector. This latest collection of songs is good. Ronnie still has a wonderful voice. The ballads are excellent and I feel this is where she needs to continue singing. I did not like the ""rock"" songs that tried to recapture the Phil Spector Wall-of-Sound."
1,Has Ronnie even heard the original sah loh nay?,"Ronnie? sweetheart? have you ever heard mickey lee lane's original version of sah loh nay? It is SUPER transparent that you've only heard the Detroit Cobras version. You used the cobra's arrangement to a T! There is NOTHING of the original in the song. Everything about it is verbatim. how kooky! Guess what else? the cobras released it in the late 90s. They also have an eerily similar album cover on their record that has the song on it.shameeeeeeeeeeeee on you. i bet you didn't throw the cobras a single dollar for ripping them off.Life, Love and Leaving"
4,Works just fine,"I bought this when my old fashioned mallet-style pounder finally died (the head flew off the stick after years of making chicken piccata). This one works great and has a comfortable grip. I like to use it for ""chopping"" chocolate that is going to be melted - just put your bar of ghiradelli or sharffen-berger in a ziploc bag and smash away. no melting on your hands and no messy chards of chocolate all over your counter."
5,Perfect for the task!,"I have to say, I have been needing a meat pounder for a long time and this one is great. I used it on chicken and it did a great job with very little effort on my part. Plus is was very easy to clean, just some soap and water. I am very pleased with this item!"
1,NOT dishwasher safe or designed well,The good: It looks niceThe bad:1) It is not dishwasher safe. Finish flakes off and aluminum corrodes after only a few washings.2) The handle is too short to use for pounding on it's side.3) Prolonged use inflicts pain on your hand while pounding using the large round surface. Our hands don't work well as hammers.I would not recommend this particular model to anyone.
2,"Three years later, paint peeling off into food","It was good while it lasted. I've had this piece for three years and was surprised yesterday to find the silver paint (which I didn't realize was paint) chipping and peeling off, nearly falling into our food. Naturally, no one wants to eat paint -- and it could be toxic. The item promptly went into the garbage. It's not as functional as more traditional, hammer-style mallets, so I'm glad I have a chance now to buy a better one."
1,disappointed,"I generally like Oxo products, but the non-stick surface on the Oxo Good Grips Meat Pounder is flaking off the surface. The design is good, but the material is not acceptable."
5,Very Well Pleased,We have had the meat pounder for almost a month and are extremely pleased with it. It is of sturdy construction and the shape and weight make tenderizing meat almost effortless.
3,$14.95 for Italian lamb chops and smashing ginger,This is the preferred style for a meat flattener and it has the necessary weight. This is the best priced product with these qualifications.
3,Non-stick surface flaking!,The non-stick surface started flaking after short period of use. I love the design and feel but the flakes are coming off onto meat. Would have been better without coating.
5,Great!,"This is the first meat pounder I have ever owned, and I've wanted one for a long time. This one works really great, having a larger flat pounding surface, and it's easy to use and clean. Great product!"
1,don't buy this,"the coating flakes off...I liked the pounder itself, but the flakes of coating can't be good for us to eat!"
5,Very cute and soft rocking cow!,I really like this product. It is nice and soft like a stuffed animal but stable enough for the baby to rock on it. My little one has not quite figured out how to use it but she loves to pet it and even hug it when she sits on it. I still love to look at it as it just looks as adorable as it did on the picture online. The fabric is very soft and nice to touch.I recommend this to all my friends
1,Infomercial,This video is pretty much a waste of good money. It is little more than an infomercial for Bennet Marine. There is nothing other than VERY basic info about using a GPS on it.
1,Tedious,This book was unintresting from the start. It was required reading for one of my many history classes. At best an average micro level history of the topic with good primary sources.
1,Poor Poduct,I must say it was rather disappointing to buy this product as it did nothing for my acne scars and dark spot. I wish I could send back the product and get my money back.
4,Useful book,This book is not a complete guide but is a good self-learning help.It can be also used as a quick reference.A good starting point for combustion studies. Then other books are required if complete treatment is required.Small but nice part of useful mathematics in appendix. Not a rigorous treatment but quick explanation of some topics related to CFD.
3,Grounded beauty,"Neat to see. The dragonfly doesn't stay in the air very long no matter what I did, so if you are looking for fun flight times, better go with an RC helicopter. The design is great to look at, and the sounds and feel of the dragonfly are really pretty incredible, but I think it needs work to keep it in the air."
2,"Cool concept, poor execution","My 8-yr old had this dragonfly on his Christmas wishlist and got it from a relative. We read the instructions, took the dragonfly out of the box and flew it for a few minutes - indoors - and on the fourth or fifth fall, from not very high up, the wings broke in two places. I was helping my son, and we were not at all rough with the toy, but still it broke incredibly easily. My son was really disappointed, so I phoned WowWee customer service and was told to take photos of the broken wings and email them in. So then I did that, and received a one line reply telling me to buy new wings on the WowWee website; apparently, the wings are not covered in the ""warranty"". When the dragonfly broke so quickly, my son said, ""This toy sucks!"" and I have to say the same of WowWee's customer service. Needless to say, we won't be buying any more of WowWee's products."
2,Lovely toy . . .breaks easily!,I came across this toy in Walmart on sale for $25 bucks and my 8 yr old son LOVED it. It is a really cool and fun toy for a boy that age. It broke in 3 days. I assumed it was just my son being rough and he was devastated so I ordered it on Amazon. It broke after another 3 or 4 days. This toy is not durable.
1,not worth it,This toy was easy to break thats for sure it only lasted 2 days. no i would not recomend this product.
3,Looks better on TV,"My son wanted this toy really bad so we got it for him on Black Friday. Within an hour of playing with it he had bent the antenna about 4 times by running into walls, etc while trying to play in the house. Finally it broke off so we lost some range right off the bat. The toy does not fly as well as it does on tv and seems like it doesn't want to stay in the air for more than a few seconds before it crashes. My son, who is 8, is happy enough with it, so I'm not going to complain about it too much. All I can say is i'm glad I didn't pay full price for this toy because it is not worth it. They need to do some work on the toy and bring it out after they work out all the defects."
2,"Breaks easily, horrible customer support","I bought this dragonfly because I had always thought it would be cool to have a flying toy with actual flipping wings. I got it - and it was defective. Amazon shipped me another one, and I shipped the original back. I got another one, and it was the coolest toy I had ever tried out. It needed a lot of space though. The second time I was flying it, it hit my dining table. I thought it should be fine because of the hard, durable shell they advertised, but I was wrong. The dragonfly wings came off. It comes with a second pair of wings - that wasn't my problem. The actual plastic that HELD the wing in was broken! I contacted their customer support twice, and both times they told me to buy a new dragonfly body[...]. I had originally bought it from here for [...] and wasn't willing to spend another [...] on it because it broke after only the second time!"
2,"Fun content, abominable reproduction...","I have a first printing of this book, so hopefully Marvel has fixed the problems I'm about to discuss...No hard sell necessary for the stories and art, right? Starlin was coming into his own in the first half of this book, and it's a wild, cosmic ride that's perfect for a 13 year old boy (the age I first saw these)... the art has some rough spots, but Starlin was still pretty young when he was doing these...The downside to this is Marvel's horrible reproduction... the muddy look of the ink lines (particularly when you've seen the originals) is ugly and distracting... they really cheaped out on this collection!!! The second half fares a little better, but still not as good as the original GN... how could they not notice how bad the ink lines reproduced!?!?! The editor should be fired for allowing this mess to be published!!"
4,A good way to get a clue,"As long as you go in with realistic expectations of how much you'll be learning, this is a great book. It doesn't go deep into any one topic, but it does cover many of the essentials of accounting and finance (with some econ thrown in near the end), explaining concepts clearly and using well-chosen examples. It succeeds in being basic without boring the reader, and it somehow comes off as better written and more engaging than anything in the Dummies series.I'd especially recommend it as preparation for college students about to take their first accounting or finance class."
1,Download this publication free on the internet.,"After doing a simple Google search, I found that this publication was available for online download at no cost. Be advised that this book gives no concise explanation or plans for building devices, only a summary of magnetic properties. To pay anything for what I consider a brief summary is a rip-off."
4,INTERESTING,"He was adjusting air gaps in his magnetic circuits at to drop the magnetic resistance at one pole and increase it at the other pole. The difference in magnetic resistance external capacitance becomes asymmetric. Asymetric capacitance also occurs in bifilar coil designs. Heres where it gets complicated. The differences of the pole resistances alter the center of the magnet and bloch walls form at the centers and reverse magnetic currents create a small south pole at the north side and visa versa. When a metal conductor is comes and out of the field on the side of the end, it creates back emf. The back emf is compensated by the small opposite poles at the end of the magnets which normally dont exist. Therefore friction somehow gets turned into a magnetic boost to create a Perepiteia like generator. This book has allot of illustrations."
2,"Check your facts, dude",Dale's was not the World's First Micro in a can. There were a number of micro's available in Canada well before 2002.
3,"Worth seeing, but not great","I'm fascinated by Jim Jones and Peoples Temple, and read and watch everything I can find. I got a good deal on this OOP video at another site, so if you're a completist, you can find the DVD at a more reasonable price.The PBS Jonestown documentary has more archival footage and interviews than this A&E; poduction. The dramatized scenes are good, but I prefer the original films and sound recordings. That said, this video is worth seeking out and watching."
3,From the back cover:,"Spirited Filly. Born and raised in the backwoods of Virginia, Tawny Blair knew that her dream of being swept off her feet by a handsome nobleman would never come true. But when she met Lord Bart Montgomery, Tawny saw at once that reality could far surpass her fantasies. And when he took her in his strong arms, she thrilled to the desire in his searing caresses, knowing that she would soon surrender to his manly embrace, no matter what the price of passion would be.Seductive Stallion. The dashing British Lord had voyaged to America for only one reason; to acquire Diablo, the magnificent black stallion, for his famous Montgomery Stables in England. But from the moment he feasted his eyes on the bewitching barefoot beauty leaning on the paddock fence, he vowed to tame and comquer the high-spirited Tawny! He would woo and win this velvet-skinned enchantress until, burning with a rapture only he could satisfy, she would willingly bestow upon him her ultimate kiss of fire."
5,THE Best Basic Strategy Book!,"Although Revere's counts aren't as good as some others out there today, this book was the authority on blackjack when it was published. And you know what? It still pretty much is. This is a great book for beginners. The numbers were done by Julian Braun of IBM so the basic strategy is second to none. This book is a must for any player, beginner or advanced!"
4,Playing Blackjack As a Business,"This book is well written and covers basic through advanced play in a way that should be easy for any level of player to follow. Especially insightful and useful are the charts on strategy. Some people argue some of the concepts in this book are out of date; however, if studied and mastered you should find they still hold true depending on the rules of the particular casino your are playing. It is a worthy complement to other books on the subject written more recently. The more you know and the more you have mastered different stategies the better you play will be. This is a great resource."
5,Book holds solid advice that still rings true...,"I purchased & read this book a few years back, it reminds me of the book by ken uston (which was the 1st book on 21 i read). even though it may seem dated to read it now - it's solid advice. i took his advice while in vegas 3 yrs. ago, dated or not it still holds true! i first learned basic strategy when i was 21, and i go to the casinos in lousiana just to practice my counting skills (i can count up to 6 decks accurately w/ up to 6-7 players at the table). no one is going to learn this overnight, but you can do so - my only question to anyone reading this is: how bad do you want to?"
5,Card Counter Understanding,"This was the second best of 23 BJ books that I read, but an absolute prerequisite to understanding the probabilities. His work on statistically what to expect, how often is a requirement for success."
3,Good but out of date,"It is a pretty good book but it is out of date. It was first published in 1969! Since then, there have been lots of advancements in the game of blacjack. Overall, I do not feel it is must reading for todays player given that the player has read the other great books that are probably better."
5,Timeless BlackJack Book!,"This 1960's Lawrence Revere textbook, and that's what it is, is a very thorough technical offering that covers all aspects of card counting, the game itself and strategy without the go-go fluff we expect today."
4,Needs updating,"I read this book when I lived in Reno about 15 years ago. I thought it was the best book on blackjack in the world. I recently read ""The Ultimate Edge,"" and then I re-read this. I now see that ""Playing Blackjack As A Business"" is missing a lot.It has a good basic strategy and good tips on how to practice, but doesn't give a good betting strategy, and really doesn't tell you how hard it is to actually win money and get away with it.Also, there is really no way to tell which count to use. The book has a bunch of counts, and you can buy two others for $200 each, but you really can't tell which is better than which."
2,Love Joan Baker Art Glass - but this one's poor quality,"I have four other pieces of Joan Baker art glass varying from small to quite large and love them all. So I didn't expect this piece to be significantly different. But it is! It has dull dark gold lines between the glass colors - where the tiffany foil would be in real stained glass. For a small glass piece, there's no room for this in the design - looks kind of crude - not like my others which are much more refined/detailed in their design.Also, there are violet colors added at the bottom of the piece, and it's done so poorly that it almost looks like a child had dotted the glass with a felt tipped marker.None of these differences are visible in the product photo, but they're clear when you're holding it in person. I hung it up for a day to see if it would grow on me. No luck. Thank you Amazon for allowing this return."
3,Total Exposure,"I watched this VHS tape only once because the tape got caught in my machine. I was able to get it out and rewind the tape but a piece of plastic was rattling around in the casing so I decided to throw the tape out. It was an okay movie, so not that much of a loss. The acting was good but the story was just average."
1,Looks Nice,"My 10 year old son bought this product because he wanted to make Utube videos. He spent a fair amount of time building this which was actually great for him. He made videos for a couple of days and the arms broke. This is not a play thing like the Star War figures. It is fairly fragile and not really meant to be ""played"" with. If you want to buy it and put it on the shelf or play ""nicely"" with it then that is ok. My sense is that someone somewhere realized there was a market for something that looked like these things and made them but they are not that durable if you want to actually play with them. My son was upset when it broke and it took him a few days to recover. Everything that the company did was great........it was on time......they delivered a product........but I would think twice about getting one of these if the intended purpose is for a little boy to play with it."
4,A couple of kids are hiding from the Nazis in a house.,As a sixth grader I rate Hide and Seek a 8 because there are some bad words in it but it is really interesting. I don't think there should be bad words because it's a book that a kid would read more then a adult.
1,Be Careful of DVD-R Recorded On Demand Products,"Like the previous reviewer, I enjoyed the televised program. The problem is with trying to play a DVD-R on many of the newer DVD players. I'm not a ""techie"" so all the different DVD-R, DVD-RW, etc. confuse the heck out of me anyway. Just a warning to be sure know when you're buying a DVD-R Recorded On Demand product and that it may not play on your machine."
4,Very enjoyable,"I caught the series on TV and thought it was very interesting. I liked the mix of both former Devil's Brigade members and those who were going through the ""recreated"" training. It gave two different perspectives from two different generations. Overall I thought it was a very good show."
1,Shampoo,"I have used this shampoo for 5 years . This is the first time I have ordered this thru Amazon, and am very dissatisfied. The shampoo and the conditioner I purchased are very old , which gives this product a very stale smell. The shampoo has also been diluted to half it's strength by whoever distributed this for Amazon. Your help in this matter would be appreciated. Thank You"
2,Few reviews,".There is a reason this book has few reviews.On the one hand, it deals with an interesting subject - the election of a pope. Yet, on the other hand, it ignores too many of the rules and circumstances which actually elect popes.It is likely both the subtitle of this book 'Murder in the Vatican' and its ideology were taken from the true crime blockbusterMurder in the Vatican: The CIA and the Bolshevik Pontiffwhich recounts in hard-hitting fashion when the politicking that goes on when a pope is elected really turns to murder.I would suggest the author go back to the drawing boards on this one. Yet, when the murder of a pope succeeds as true crime, it most often fails as fiction."
2,"Too hard to use, very focused on major skills","I just bought this to use with my almost 7mo who just started crawling. Rather than exercises, it seems to be better described as tips to help your baby hold his/her head up, roll over, crawl, stand, and walk. My child can crawl, but doesn't meet the skill requirements for standing. Yet, the book gives no suggestions to help with those requirements. It just describes some things that may make learning to stand with stability easier. I didn't find the ""exercises"" all that helpful at all, and will be reselling my copy."
1,Not worth Buying,"You will require microscope to look at the stones.The chain is so thin, not sure how manys hours or days it is going to last.not worth buying,"
4,"Pretty, delicate, and feminine","I bought this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day and I think she will like it a lot. It's a very delicate shade of light blue. My only reservation is the size of the chain which is quite short and very lightweight, but the pendant has a large space in it for the chain so she can easily change the pendant onto a heavier or longer chain. I bought this as a daily deal and feel that I more than got my money's worth."
4,Dainty!,"The necklace is very feminine and makes a beautiful ""special occasion"" necklace. I am happy with it."
5,About this CD (Informational),"Works on this CD:1. Schnittke, Sonata for Cello & Piano.2. Denisov, Sonata for Solo Clarinet.3. Kasparov, 'Sonata-Infernale' for Solo Bassoon.4. Ekimovsky, Piano Sonata w.Funeral March.5. Pavlenko, 'Tapestry' for Wind Quintet.6. Vasks, 'Landscape with Birds' for Solo Flute"
5,Perfect for my Integra!,well it comes with more than I needed but it is cheaper to buy this set then each gasket individual gasket. Everything fit perfect.
3,Very predictable,"Very formulaic, not very original. I almost bought several books by this author when I purchased this one ($2.99), now I am glad I only bought the one."
5,Perfect for cubicle,Very light and velcro sticks to a cubicle. Great value especially because there are 2 included for a low price.
3,Nice size,"Pros: Good size, clear, looks nice on cubicle walls. It brings up the professional look of your cube.Cons: Needs a little stronger Velcro. They are little tough to stick and are easily knocked off your cubicle wall.If it were not for the Velcro, this product would rate 5 stars."
4,One of my daughter's favorites,"I'll add my voice to the many that have stated that this is a terrific book. My daughter loves the characters and the rhyming. The only (minor) caveat I would add is about the ending. The characters come to a house where no one is home, so ""tippy-toeing on 14 feet"" they go into it, eat a snack, make a mess, and then climb into a child's bed."
5,Our favorite book delights every time!,"My 12 month old daughter is literally obsessed with this book! She loves pointing to all the animals and learning what each one is. There's a page where the orange cat is yawning big, and my daughter always puts her hand to her mouth and ""yawns"". It's a joy to read this with her because she has so much fun, and the story is sweet too."
5,My daughter's favorite book!,I now have this book memorized and my 19-month old daughter yells out the last word of each line. It is her absolute favorite and she requests it daily. It's a fun book!
2,Schizophrenic Bug Breaking and Entering,"Am I the only one bothered by the mathematical innacuracies in this book? Does anyone else notice at the end when the bug is counting up his new friends, HE INCLUDES HIMSELF IN THE COUNT! Does he have multiple personalities? And is breaking and entering really behavior we want to encourage for children - these so-called new friends are as bad as Goldilocks in that regard. Not to mention the burglary. Now, when they're tippy-toeing on fourteen feet, the author is obviously basing this on the fact that there are seven of them, and they're all on their hind feet. But pigs don't have feet - they have hooves. Doesn't seem to have bothered my kids, because they all love the book."
2,a mom,"After reading other reviews, I purchased this book for my 14month old. He loves book and most especially if they have animals in them. I have been disappointed in this book. My son hardly ever picks it up only when encouraged. There are so many other better books out there to purchase."
5,Hurray,"The last page of this book sums it up perfectly, ""Hurray!"" My 17 month old loves this book. The rhymes match perfectly and she loves to look at the animals. She has begun to say some parts of the story with me and always yells ""Hurray!"" at the end of the story. This is another book we will read repeatedly."
5,Cheerful rhymes,"My 2-year-old grandson loves to chime in on the last few words of every line in this story. We have fun poring over the details where all the animals are having their own lunches and discussing who's eating what. The message about friendship is well portrayed by the cheerful text and exuberant illustrations. (And the issue of animals entering a house uninvited is perfect for initiating a discussion of boundaries, and perhaps a literary comparison with ""Goldilocks."")"
3,"Good read, but a bit thin","A lot of great pictures but not much technical detail. A good coffee table book but don't buy it as a reference. If you're looking for a book with more information about the technical specs of Naval aircraft I suggest ""Carrier"" by Tom Clancy, if you want to know what it takes to be a US Navy fighter pilot get ""Bogeys and Bandits"" by Robert Gandt."
4,Mississippi Bridge,"In Mississippi in the 1930's, Blacks were very excluded from others. They were considered different and bad. In this book, Blacks were kicked off a bus because there were white people who wanted to ride. The bus then took a horrible turn, and went into the river. The Blacks who were kicked off tried to save the drowning passengers, even though they were treated so badly. I think this book shows how badly some Blacks were treated. It also shows that all people should be treated fairly."
1,The Event that stops discrimination,"The genre of `Mississippi Bridge' is realistic fiction. In Mississippi during the 1930's whites were given special treatment over the other people who were `of color'. The theme is hope because it does get better for everyone at the end. In the story the conflict is that blacks are mistreated and that whites have more `power' over what happens; also that when more people who were white came on the bus Josias, Stacey and their grandmother off the bus in order to make more room. We did like the ending and how the town comes toghter. Though, what we did not like was how the Josias, Stacey and their grandmother had to get off just to make more room for other people who were not in the same `social class' as them. This book was very good and had many exciting parts in the story; all kids would love reading this book."
5,cute,"The J-Team makes another comeback, as they are seen committing crimes... or you would think. The title of this episode will tell you why, and it leads to some rather humorous scenes. One of the better episodes of this season, that is for sure!"
4,yes!,"Love this episode, it has some funny bits but there are also some plotholes which prevent me from giving this episode 5 stars. Two big questions I have are...How did Valmont get Tohru from the shop to his apartment by himself? Tohru is HUGE.How did Valmont become part of the monks in the first place? What is his history with them?This is still a pretty good episode, but the plot holes are hard to ignore."
4,Cute episode,"It is off to Scotland to find the sheep that has inherited the power of the Sheep Talisman, Astral projection is a interesting power and is used a lot here. Turns out animals can talk on the astral plane, who knew."
4,Cute episode,"This touches on Mayan mythology and brings El Toro and Paco back as the search for the rat holding the power of reanimation is on. A statue of Quetzalcoatl is brought to life, making for quite a mishap as EL Toro and Jade are mistaken for gods - a evil god and a good goddess, respectively."
5,Excellent,"This Video/CD was called ""Rain of Ruin"" when it was shown on the History Channel. It shows the history of the Manhattan Project/Silverplate from start to finish. The last 30 minutes deal with the dropping of ""little boy"" on Hiroshima and ""Fat man"" on Nagasaki. Most people do not know that Nagaskai was actually the 4th choice of cities but weather prevented the dropping of the bomb on target # 2 which was Kokura. This film uses a tremendous amount of raw footage. Its very impressive."
1,Not for Poodle Fanciers,"My awful rating of this Video is stricly intended to be a alert to the wrong message that the title of the tape flashes.This single tape is about how to groom your baby pet at home. It is correct on all it's procedures, shows correct practices and is full of sound advices on how to handle your beloved pet so you can do your stuff, BUT there is NOTHING in it about POODLES!This video only shows you mixed breed dogs! There is nothing specific about the breed. It teaches how to bath and do a plain vanilla trimming on mixed breed dogs!Do not expect to find here nothing about the multitude of trims that can be done on this fabulous breed or even how to do a single one of then on a pure breed poodle.To be more specific there is not a single poodle in the entire tape!Good how-to-do-tape, but is is not for Poodle fanciers."
2,Not Pleased.,"I have an English Bulldog and English Bulldog Breeders seem to give Fromm Good reviews. Since changing my Bulldogs' food from Blue Buffalo to Fromm my bulldogs sheds more than he normally does. Also, his gas is worse and more frequent. He has gained more weight. In the morning his eyes have that morning gunk in it and his stools are more runny than before. This is the only thing that has changed in his diet. I take really good care of my dog. By the way, I did not change him suddenly from Blue Buffalo to Fromm. It was gradual and I only feed him a cup and a half in the morning and at night. I will try the Senior Low Activity Version and if I do not have any luck I will switch back to Blue Buffalo."
1,This was AWFUL!,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It was filled with mindless biographies of, at best, individuals who are marginally affiliated with Judaism or, at worst, self-hating Jews. Reading this book was like watching a car-wreck...I can't believe that anyone would seriously consider Judaism worthwhile after reading these shallow biographies. If this is the best Judaism has to offer today, we're in a lot of trouble!"
3,I WAS going to read it...,"...but then I saw Jay Leno interview Dustin Hoffman last week. Hoffman may have been ""born Jewish"" but all it did was sadden me to hear about his Christmas tree in his home while growing up and the Christmas gifts that are still shared in his home. All this interview did was sadden me and now I don't even want to know about the rest of these ""Jewish"" celebrities."
5,Enlightening,"It was very enlightening to see that ""famous"" people struggle with the same issues of faith that the rest of us do. While most don't hold on to traditional Jewish customs, most are fiercly loyal to their heritage.A very interesting read."
2,disappointing and uninspiring,"What a disappointment. These people are prominent, but not for their connection to Judaism. Sarah Jessica Parker chooses to have a mezzuah because she thinks it's a cute good luck charm. Many of the people highlighted had no Jewish upbringing and know little about their religion.Boring, disappointing. I expected much more."
2,ignoramuses,"For the most part, these people whom the author thought are prominent Jews are either ignoramuses as regards to Judaism and our heritage (especially the 2 Supreme Court Justices, who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek) or are not even Jewish at all. A waste of time."
2,Major disappointment,"When I first heard about a Ramones box set, I thought it would be like the Misfits, or the Nirvana box set, i.e. a collection of studio outtakes, demos, B-sides, etc. But then I find out it's yet ANOTHER best-of compilation, did we really need this?. The ""Lifestyles"" DVD was needed, but that could have been released on its own. It's sad how record labels cash-in on dead artists. It is also ironic how Johnny was cashing in on his dead bandmates, and not long after he died too..."
5,Awesome!,The Ramones rule forever! Wish I woulda heard there music before 1992 when I was in college!
2,Not for Prostate Wellness,I tried it and had no improvement to my problem with frequent night time urination. Was going every 2 hours. I tried a plant sterol product called Super Beta Prostate. That did completely resolve the prostate issue. My brothers have had success with it as well.
5,The best extract & formulation,"Out of all the brands, formulations, etc. this is the best I've found. It has the CO2 extract of saw palmetto, also has the organic pumpkin seed oil--in an appropriate ratio (ie: not too much, relative to the saw palmetto extract).The only downside for me is the $4.99 shipping. Otherwise this is a great product. I take 2x/day with AM/PM meals.."
3,Laptop surface,"This is an ok product. It's made of a hard black plastic, with slots in it to vent the heat. It is just wide enough to use a mouse on it if you open it all the way up, but it's flat against your lap in that configuration, and less effective against the heat. My laptop is 13.3 inches, so if you have a larger one, don't order this product if you want to put a mouse on it. I find that when I fold it up so that I can use the tilt, it was easier on my neck, and not as hot against my lap, but then its work surface was much too small to use a mouse on it.Mine arrive opened and without all of the accessories that were supposed to be included."
4,Worth the money,"This book was a lot of fun to read, and I am not a particular fan of time-travel stories. 'Nick of Time"" was my first Casey Claybourne, and I really enjoyed it -- recommend it, especially if you are looking for a 'new' author and haven't tried her. Claybourne's plot and characters were believable, and they made you WANT to follow them through their adventures. The way she handled the time travel was really creative and interesting and let you have the 'willing suspension of disbelief.' This book is a keeper and will be re-read."
5,A FABULOUS READ!!,"NICK OF TIME is a story of two people from two different times destined to be together. This story is filled with suspense, tragedy, hope, miracles and a passionate love. It is a wonderful book with an ending that is to die for. I recommend it to anyone. You'll enjoy the journey. Trust me!"
3,an OK read,"A modern man sent back to the past - it makes for an intriguing story. I liked the way he tried to adapt to new circumstances. The growing love was quite nice to see, even though all the abuse the heroine had to go through was a bit too much. All in all, a nice afternoon read."
4,Sound advice from a guy who's clearly done his homework,"Pring makes an excellent case for his premise thatevery investor's worst enemy is him (or her)self. Investing evokes a host of emotions - fear, greed,panic, hope - all of which drive the investor to make unsound decisions. The key is to develop an objective plan and stick to it - not necessarily because it's foolproof, but more importantly because it allows a means of acting outside our emotions. He gives many good examples of how emotions cloud sound judgement, but after he's made his point I felt he ran out of gas. Though there is some insight into how the market reacts to news and other events, there's a lot of repetition and a lot of gratuitous summaries of other people's advice - filler for what is essentially an excellent magazine article stretched into a book."
2,Complicated Psychologocal Hypothesis,"His book is clearly written with fine examples, however, its not presented in a retainable, usable format. There are other books that present the same topic in a more effective manner. The main premise of the book: ""Do not let market concerns drive your investment strategies."" There, I just saved you $16.00."
5,Very good book for the beginners & a review for the advanced,"This book as the title suggests rightly attacks the psychology of a trader. It points out what all challenges comes in the life of a trader & contrasts the usual trading approach that amateurs take with the actual right approach to tackle them. It has convincingly established that just controlling our moods, attitudes & actions towards investing can save us from loosing much or all of our money, which most people do in real life, & in turn we can make profits.I have myself made a lot of mistakes while trading & found all of these in this book as an example, then got embarrassed of why not reading this book earlier. I strongly recommend that every trader should read this book thoroughly."
3,Knowing yourself,"A serious trader or investor can never dismiss this book. It's a must read considering there are not very many investment psychology books written with a comprehensive coverage. And if you know Pring's background and have read more of his books, you will understand this work better. He has done a good work in nailing the points of Investment psychology specially by dedicating a section on ""Knowing yourself"". Easily one of the best books written on the subjet. One reading is not enough if you want to really get ""IT""."
2,a series of chatty essays,the book describes events without giving a clear cut advise. a good bed-time story book but useless for serious investors
3,Conversational Style,"This book is divided into three parts: Individual Psychology,Crowd Psycholoy, and Trading Rules.Perhaps it is because I've not read about Contrary Opinion,I find this section enlightening. It is to be used in conjunctionwith TA and conventional valuation methods. If some of thepoints could be enumerated in Arabic symbols 1,2,3..., they would be clearer.The strength of a retail investor is flexibility. Sticking tothe Trading Rules religiously like the Constitution doesn'tappeal to me."
1,Poor Product,"I have been pretty dissappointed with this TV/DVD combo. The fifth time it was used the DVD player stopped working. We couldn't get it into DVD mode and so the player wouldn't open. And, unfortunately, it had to be shipped to Texas to be fixed. And, the shipping was a LOT. I could have purchased a regular new DVD player for the cost. I don't recommend purchasing this product."
3,"Cute, but...","I originally purchased this TV for my kids more than a year ago and it is great. My kids love how it looks and the picture quality is great. The only problem I have with it is that the parental controls don't work. The TV won't take the code printed in the instruction manual so I can't program it to only play movies rated for children. I returned the TV for a new one, but the new TV does the same thing. It's not just me- I've had many friends and relatives follow the instructions and try to input the code to no avail. Aside from this, the TV is great."
4,Saved my sanity!,"I bought this TV for my kids and they love it! I finally have a little peace! The remote is a little difficult for them to use but that's easily fixed with a universal that is a little less complicated. My only real complaint is that three times now we've managed to ""hit a button"" on the remote that causes the picture to go black and white and the only way we can fix it is to turn off the TV, which is a pain if you're in the middle of a movie. Other than that it's one of the best products we've bought so far, I finally got my living room and sanity back!"
3,"didn't last, good tv, bad dvd player","dvd player broke after a few uses- got stuck and had to pry open with a knife, now, less than a year later, dvd player still only works occasionally"
2,"No doubt, this book is plagued with errors","I participate in an MCSD study group out here in the Washington, DC Metro Area and we have been using this book, as well as the first New Riders' Book published. While this book does not contain as many errors as the New Rider's book - it contains so many that my group gave up on trying to prepare an errata sheet to send in to Sybex. Imagine Chapter 6 stating that it will discuss transactions in Chapter 7 and Chapter 7 saying only ""see Chapter 6 for more information on transactions"". This is not a typo error, or incorrect code - it is blatantly incomplete. If you wish to study for the Access exam, I suggest the following - take the Transcender simulation tests and use other non-test books as your textbooks such as Access Developer's Handbook and Building Applications with Microsoft Access. Better yet if you live in the Washington, D.C. Metro area, join our study group - it is free and you will be in the midst of some strong developers."
2,Ugh... This is going no where,"I have the 70-069 in two weeks and this book is driving me insane. There are typos, as well as wrong answers on the cd. The exercises rarely work typed in the way the book has them. You'll need to figure out most of the debugging yourself. Bad book, don't buy it."
1,Move on and look for another book......,too much typos in the text book. too many bugs in the test engine. unrealistic review questions (too shallow compared to the real exam)
3,"Good hard-copy, exam engine error-riddled.","OK, here's the deal: I used Howard Hawhee's book and passed the VB5.0 test in 3 weeks. Moving right along, I tried this book next. Second chapter exam has 3 errors (Peter, see modulus, Property Get, e.g., and PLEASE correct!). Nevertheless, the text portion of the book is good, not difficult to understand, and head-and-shoulders above the other Access 95 book, from New Riders, which I also purchased and immediately shelved."
1,Horrendous,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!The book and CD both contain errors to numerous to mention. Typos and incorrect information are rampant throughout the book. The CD has a barely functional testing engine with incorrect answers, it also can't seem to calculate simple percentages.How this book ever got past an editor has to be a story in itself."
2,Not a winner in my book!,"I've found more than a half-dozen errors in the first 100 or so pages, including code that fails. I think all code in a study guide should have been tested and proved correct prior to publishing."
4,it makes me want to fall in love,I love the sound of this cd. I heard it many times and never asked who the artist was...so I went on the web to look for song titles that resembled the music I heard. Finally I've found it...Ginuwine!!! How embarrassing. Its such a summer-bump-the-music-have-a-fling-or-fall-in-love cd!!! thanks for the help Amazon!
1,FAKE AND GROSS SMELLING!!!!!,"This is NOT a real Betsey Johnson lotion. It smells so gross like soap, not her signature scent at all. Be warned - buy elsewhere. Terrible!!!!"
2,:(,"I bought this product hoping to get rid of my gnat problem in my house plants. I recently purchased and planted them, so I was quite annoyed to see that they were crawling with bugs. The bugs are driving me crazy and after reading a few reviews here I decided to give this product a try. Well...so far, I only seem to have angered the bugs. I'm hoping that they are dying, but as it is only day one can not be certain. I have no idea how long it takes for this product to take effect... in other disappointing news, the canister came to me with a broken seal...and it seems to be only half full. I am trying to resolve this new problem now. I might have been a little more easy going about the lack of a full container of product had the gnats not continued to fly around!"
3,Not thrilled,"I dislike giving such a neutral review, but I still have white flies and the Bonide did not seem to do much of a job ridding the plants of them. If there are other measures I should have taken, someone can let me know and I will try them and revise my rating."
3,Active Ingredient,Systemic Houseplant Granules by Bonide contains Disulfoton as the active insecticide. Disulfoton is an organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used as an insecticide.
5,I Think It Worked!,"I had a pretty severe infestation of fungus gnats on my houseplants. I tried all the home remedies like soapy water, repotting, letting the soil dry out, etc and it didn't seem to help. I even went to a large home improvement store and their employees could not help. I found this product on Amazon after seeing it in a video when I was searching online for how to get rid of these pests. I put it in my plants according to the package directions and it appears to have worked. I had such a severe infestation that I couldn't shake any of my plants without a swarm of them coming up. It's been a week since I put the stuff on my plants and I have not seen one gnat in my house."
2,Didn't Work For Fungus Gnats,"To combat a severe fungus gnat infestation, I applied this product according to the instructions to my indoor houseplants (pothos). After several weeks, it has not stopped (or even slowed) the fungus gnat population.I have also tried:- Letting the soil dry completely between waterings- Neem Oil- Insecticidal Soap- Hydrogen PeroxideNone of these methods have been successful in eradicating the gnats. My plants have stopped growing entirely (probably due to larvae eating the roots), and the larvae and adults can still be seen crawling and flying around.As a last resort, I have thrown out my plants and sterilized the pots. In the future, I will:1. Be very careful to buy high-quality, well-draining potting soil!2. Apply BTI (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), which is the bacteria found in mosquito dunks."
2,"Received a previously opened package, only 2/3 full",Bottle had been opened. It was not sealed closed. Just used some this PM and don't know if the product is any goo but I am disappointed with the packaging or lack thereof. I think I was ripped off. The bottle was only about 60% full of granules.
1,It didn't work,Not happy with the product followed the instruction and was still leave with the pest in my house plants. Won't try again.
1,This stuff kiils honey bees,Do not buy or use this product - it contains Imidacloprid which poisons the environment. It is the toxic substance recently found to be responsible for the bee Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) now devastating bee colonies in Europe and North America.
1,killer stuff,All the leaves have fallen off my bouganvilla. I was treating it for aphids and gnats. I'm not sure about this product.
4,Sound rebirth,CDs sound fresh and the clarity is unbelievable; delicious sound in a smaller package. Add a small subwoofer and you're set.
3,amazon's 3 listings are for the same camera,"The various listings on amazon for the dxg 506 are all the same cameras.The only difference is the colors be it black, blue, silver, or pinkso the reviews that purtain to one of them would apply to all of them.If you want a low priced video recorder that will fit in your pocket, store on an SD card, and use AA batteries this would fit that bill.Aside from the weak low light performance the worst thing I've foundon the camera is the lens cap tends to fall off."
2,Julian,"La compre hace algun tiempo los videos son regulares de calidad vaja, las fotos son pesimas, y gasta denasiada bateria, se que es muy economica pero deberian mejorar el producto"
5,Fine music with outstanding performances. Concerti grow on U,"Strauss's violin concerto starts out with sounds and tunes that can be unpleasant during the first or second hearing. But, Xue-Wei is terrific. Christopher Headington is a new composer not even listed in Amazon. But, his concerto is very pleasant and beautifully played. Glover keeps the London Philharmonic at a superb level. I love this CD and am buying a duplicate, just in case. Patience may be needed for Strauss is more known for symphonic works and horn concerti. It is a five * for me. Crisply recorded. It is in my top 20 CDs. Let's get more Headington, too."
3,Briefing,"I found a reveiw of this story:Persephone Snow had a problem -- criminals were after Buster, her pet, a real live unicorn. Her family's run-down mansion seemed like the perfect place to hide out... until hunky Mack Lord showed up. He wanted to make the mansion his own. And when he set eyes on Persephone... he seemed determined to make her a part of the deal!"
2,just kinda dumb,it was just kinda dumb. stopped watching it after jeremy renners character died. it wasnt hilarious. i think it took the worst of the gangster pics of late 1990s- early 2000s and crammed it into one low budget flick. its like a crap book you buy at the airport- it wastes some time without leaving too much to think about behind
1,viewer beware,This is perhaps one of the most mind blowingly wretched pieces of celluloid to ever steal away precious moments of my life.
5,Life changer,Simply put this book is nothing short of life changing and the ideas contained within will astound you! This book brings true power to affirmations and positive thinking!If you have ever bought a positive self help book on affirmations or positive thinking this book is a must!As a race we have been fools to ignore this books advice for so long!Thank you Paul - you changed my life. Christopher Rees
4,"great watch, bad junk mail","I bought this watch for my husband. It's a great watch, but the day after I ordered it I started getting junk e-mail after junk e-mail about watches that were for sale. Very annoying."
1,Nice Heavy Watch: Band Sux,The band that came with this watch was impossible to adjust for me and so it sits in a drawer never worn and collecting dust.What a waste of my hard-earned money it was. NOT RECOMMENDED.
3,My NASB is cheaper and needs no reference work to understand the language,"I love Laurence Vance for opening my eyes about a good many things like military ""service"" and the morality of war. But I can't figure why the attachment to a beautiful but obsolete version. I think if you have to write a book of this length to explain the words, it proves the point that the book is trying to disprove. If I am a new believer should I buy a Spanish Bible + Spanish dictionary, a 400 year old English Bible + Archaic English dictionary, or should I pick up an NASB or ESV that I understand intuitively?How long will this attachment exist? In another 400 years will people still be insisting this is the only version a Christian should use? I mean, what is the endgame? What would it take for the KJVO-ers to finally put it down and pick up an English translation? What do they want?"
4,wealth of information,"I've been pleased with the book and find it an excellent companion for bible reading and study. It does fall short in one regard, to-wit: it does not include many words found only in the inter-covenantal books, or so called Apocrypha, which are included in the original Authorized Version. Denominationalism aside, I would love to see the author address this issue with the same degree of thoroughness, perhaps in a follow-up volume."
4,Fun movie to stream but EDITED,"Baffled! was a 1973 TV movie/pilot made in the UK distributed by ITC (The Muppet Show, Space:1999). It was also shown theatrically in some places. In the early 80's it was released to video by 20'th Century Fox video. Since then it was out of print until the mid 90's when it was released on another label recorded in EP. It also was edited compared to the 20'th Century Fox video version (I estimate the editing at about 5 minutes). That video is also now out of print. Now, Baffled can be streamed from Amazon, but alas has the most recent master which is the one that was used for that video and carries the edits. Still a worthy movie to check out, but I wish it was complete."
2,"Ok, Blues written by others or whatever you want to call it.","This was just a OK.Would I buy it again, Nah!!!! SorryI will sell it to you if you like,I missed something on this even though she is without a doubt a very important part of the Legend of Blues in America and deserves every mention of the word Legend.We just didn't hit it off if you know what I mean....She is not bad. Just not for me."
2,Weak Sound and hard to keep them on.,"When I ordered this Item I was expecting excellent quality sound out of them, but I was disappointed since the moment I place them on my ears.The sound is weak. The bass isn't good. They are hard to keep in place."
5,Great for toddlers!,"My child loves this movie, but it's not great for an older child. My 9 year old gets bored watching it, but my 2 year old loves it!"
4,artie65,Just a easy mystery read. If you like Marcia Muller you will like this author. Enjoyed Terra Cotta Dog equally.
4,For a good time.....,"For a really good time, obtain the audio version of The Snack Thief, put it in your player, and relax, because you're in for a treat. Inspector Montalbano reminds me of Donna Leon's Inspector Brunetti in his determination to see that justice is done while retaining his essential humanity, not an easy task for a cop. In love with the lovely Livia, but not entirely sure he wants to settle down as a married man, Montalbano's insecurities are multiplied when an orphaned little boy lands in his lap. What do the boy's prostitute mother, a murdered Tunisian fisherman, and a Sicilian businessman found stabbed in an elevator have to do with one another? Listen to this skillfully narrated version (by Grover Gardner) and enjoy the scrumptious food, the sunshine of Sicily, and the workings of a great detective's mind, and find out. A great MP3 book for the beach or that long flight."
4,Almost as good as a vacation,"It's so hard to get away these days -- between terrorist alerts and high costs of travel and vacation days being used to visit families, reading a book like The Snack Thief is a like taking a mini-vacation. Camilleri's village is fictitious, but his Inspector Montalbo is true to life. He also likes to read international crime thrillers, savors fine food, and has a laughably volatile temper that can be aroused even if the day is windy. There are episodes in this book that are truly hilarious, some that are horrific, and several that are sad. A good mix. And we're always anxious to see what has been left for his dinner in the refrigerator. Like the Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency series, this series in its entirety presents a portrait of an unforgettable way of life in a specific place with a person I'd like to spend some time with."
5,A Fascinating Writer,"This is my very first Inspector Montalbano book and I am already hookedwhich means by the way that now I am going to have to find every otherbook by this very fascinating writer, Andrea Camilleri. A man is stabbed todeath in an elevator in an apartment building and all kinds of problemsevolve from this one death semingly with no connection but the author tiesthem up perfectly. In the back of the book is a wealth of informationexplaining certain Italian phrases and actually Italian foods. It is veryhelpful. Inspector Montalbano is similar in some ways to Donna Leon'sCommissario Brunetti. Brunetti has a delightful family and Montalbanohas a delightfull girl friend whom I think he is planning on marrying.By the way both books make your mouth water. The food sounds delectable."
3,Lotus Guide Review,"The Ten Commitments By David Simon, M.D. ISBN 0-75730-406-0, HCI Whenever I see someone take a fresh look at old worldviews I feel renewed somehow. As we become more conscious, we realize more and more that we create what we focus on. Sometimes it's as simple as taking all of our ""shall nots"" and turning them around--""Thou shall not steal"" becomes ""I commit to abundance"" and ""Thou shall not kill"" becomes ""I commit to forgiveness."" It's another good example of East's meeting West and the synthesis is nothing less than a shining example of our own spiritual awakening in progress. David Simon's workshops are held at the Deepak Chopra Center. For more information call 888-424-6772 or [...]"
5,Moses v. 2006,"If Moses was in tune with the Divine millenia ago - enough to be entrusted with that era's 'Rules of the Road': The 10 commandments, then it's totally appropriate that Dr. David Simon has progressively revealed v. 2006 in his new book The 10 Commitments. David and Deepak are definitely 2 of the world's greatest healers, and they bring the Divine into their practice with many enlightening insights and practical, user-friendly action steps! I highly recommend this book for all healers AND all those in the process of healing."
5,"A Path of Awareness, Responsibility and Freedom","This is a ""must have"" book for anyone who has the desire to cultivate awareness and take full responsibility for their own growth and transformation.Ten Commitments offers a path to freedom from the control and limitations (whether conscious or subconscious) of an external authority as presented in the text of the biblical Ten Commandments. Dr Simon invites us to explore, contemplate, and then translate each commandment into a personal commitment. Personal commitments then become the vehicles for the exploration and expression of our deepest desires, intentions, and actions as they emerge from the core of our being into the world of our creation.This book is very clearly written, easy to understand, and smoothly accessible for the personal integration of the subject matter. Its message is inspiring, spacious, and very timely as a gift of healing in this era of spiritual and religious diversity and tension."
5,I am grateful for this book's message,"I am impressed with the sensitive and profound way in which the ten commitments are related to the ten commandments. Throughout my life I've struggled with the idea that God is angry and I appreciate the presentation of God in my life in a more loving and nurturing way -- which of course, I truly understand Him to be; a true representation of love. My health and well being is available to me at all times, and this book tells me exactly how to get there. It's a great gift for anyone focused on being empowered in their life."
2,Not so great dye,"This dye will give you a really bright pink if your hair is super light. However, it fades really badly, even after one wash. Great if you want something short term, but if you want something long lasting, you better look for something else."
1,Not a Dot-to-Dot book,Was shocked when I opened the book and it was not a Dot-to-Dot book. It is a Do-A-Dot book which I have not idea what that is. This looks like a coloring book that is for a younger child. Very disappointing I didn't read the Do and instead read Dot. My loss ... hope it helps you in your purchase decision.
4,Nice book to color.,This is a nice coloring book with thick lines and simple pictures. It is meant to accompany the dot-a-dot paints but our daughters (4 and 7) didn't like that most of the coloring doesn't match the round dotted end of the paints.
1,Expensive with few dots in it!,"I bought the dot art paints and bought this book specifically for my children to be able to fill empty dots with their pens.It has very few dots in it throughout. I'm extremely disappointed and wouldn't recommend this expensive book (for what it was) to anyone. Go to Oriental Trading Co to find dot art sheets. Much cheaper! Their product isn't in book form, but they actually have dots on their papers!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A humourous book about a bar that anyone can end up in, anyone from anywhere in time and space. Well, almost, anyway. They gather to drink and spin yarns, and tell jokes ranging from funny to truly awful groaners, and also to compete, it seems, at times for the worst pun award.An amusing diversion."
3,Books,I thought that this was a good book to read. It was kind of disjointed but entertaining. Spider Robinson can write some interesting books and I look forward to reading more of them.
3,Callahan's Crosstime Saloon,"""Spider Robinson is a raunchy son of a bitch. Maybe it's not the best career decision, but my ultimate goal is to write like him. Everything he writes is so full of puns that it's hard for a master punster to keep up with, and very real for science fiction. Unbelievably painful social and/or moral dilemma that you can't solve? That's ok, you're not alone. There's no fairy tale, aside from some hopeful future technologies. It is what it is, it's not what it ain't, but at least you've got some buddies to toast to it with.""Read the whole review at:[...]"
5,great instructional video,There are a lot of good tips for beginner and intermediate player in this collection.It really helped me improve my game.The video is simple but all the info is there. The best video collection I have seen so far.
5,Great Fun for everyone,"As a history major, I truly believe that the ""Book of Yanks"" is the funniest and one of the most revealing versions of American History that I have ever come across in my readings. Not only does it reveal our shortcomings as a nation in a satirical way, it shows us how we came by our defects and our misadventures.I also have to mention the Book of Dave as one of the greates treatments of American Pop Culture that I have ever seen. I would rate the Book of Dave right up there with the films of John Waters and David Lynch inasmuch as what they do to try and explain American Pop Culture.Anyone who has a healthy sense of humor, believes that everyone is basically too full of themselves, and knows peope who take themselves too seriously, need to read this book. However, if YOU take yourself too seriously, or think that there can only be one bible, take a sedative and skip this book."
2,Doorstop,"Parts of this book are funny. But not 1000 pages. Insightful? Maybe, if you're new to insight. I paid $4 for it remaindered at B. Dalton's. It, uh, doesn't float."
5,Simply brilliant and mind-boggling.,"I received it as a gift from my brother when it was first released. I was awed and amazed by it's insight into our modern culture. But, the thing that amazed me the most was the hundreds of cross-references in the columns.An incredible book to read through once and then read again in a random manner by skipping through the references."
5,A Fine Base to Stabilize your Ball,I bought this base to keep my ball in one place. It does that quite well. It is nice to have this if you intend on having an alternative to a regular chair. When you are working at your desk you can count on being in one place. Also it's snap to put it together and it's very sturdy.
5,"Just right, works well, functional to say the least","Price good, easy to put together, and very functional. Looks good, fits my ball just fine. Thank you, would purchase again. Shipping went well."
5,A supreme success,"This video represents the highest in production quality and content that such videos have to offer. It is a fascinating glimpse into the martial arts for those who have never studied and a challenge to improve for those who have. The Shaolin monks in particular have stunning technique. There is a short demonstration of chi (ki) power as well which is the foundation of hand-healing and of the highest levels of the Asian martial arts. This in itself is worth the price of the video (I would have bought it for fifty or sixty bucks without a second thought). Hand healers are rare and amazing people, whether they come from a healing perspective, a martial one, or both. At this level, there is very little difference."
1,very disappointing,"This is the worst, and incidentally the most expensive, belly dance video that I own. I would give it 0 stars, if it was possible.The video production is poor, the background is flickering and disruptive. There are couple combinations worth watching, but the rest of the choreoraphy is unimpressive, especially that leap step. The choice of costumes is wrong for her body type, and music is boring. Save your money!"
4,"Good for modified,","I bought this a few years ago, and at first (as most would expect with a bass this inexpensive) it was not terribly great. The pickups are a weak and the action is not the best. Heres what I did:-Fixed the action (alen wrenches, and some nights with weights on it)-Bought 2 sets of P-bass pickups and installed BOTH (replacing the old ones and adding another at the neck, about $40 on ebay, great deal)-Repainted it with a black gloss, gold and silver on the pickguard (sanded it down but retained the cool looking red underneath)-New strings (ernie ball hybrids)All in all, the work took about 4 hours cumulative, and only cost me about $50-60. Sure you could get a better bass for that much more, but if you want to have fun and make a bass truly your own or want to experiment on a bass, this is the one. This bass has good quality wood and hardware that can be used with the same, new and improved bass.Regards"
2,Ok I guess...,I recently bought this and was not at all satisfied. I had it for about 2 weeks and it broke when I unplugged it. The sound wasn't even that great. So I'm trying to return it. Spend the extra money unless your a VERY beginner.
4,A Bit Disappointed,"I've been an AC/DC fan since a wee lad, Back in Black was the first album I ever bought. I don't have their entire collection so I thought this 17 album box set would be great. I sourced it for $139 USD and it arrived and man am I glad i didn't pay $400 for it. Basically it's a box with 17 CD's in it. Nothing more, nothing less. I was expecting a lot more since they want $400 USD for this box. The Bonfire box set i bought years ago had way more AC/DC trinkets in it. There's just nothing in this but the discs. I figure each disc is worth $10 USD in the store X 17 albums so it would cost you around $200 to make this box set yourself off retail shelves. So i still think i got a great deal and getting them all at once remastered is a nice have it all now move. But no way is this box set worth what Amazon's got it listed for. Look around, find it cheaper. As i said, it's nothing but 17 CD cases inside the box."
5,ac/dc is the best of the best,"this is the box set ive been wanting by ac/dc for a long long time. im glad its here now... this is one you'd want to have for yourself. i know almost all- if not all of the songs on this box. and they are all great... but to me any thing by ac/dc blows me away. they are the kings of hardrock. and bon, brian, angus, and the band will always be my favorite among favorites. if you dont have this one yet, and you want a box set this one is for you for sure. bonfire is also a good one.. proud to own it. kds"
2,Nice idea but...,"it lauches the marble so forcefully that the marble bounces off of the ramp it is being lauched to. Instead of using it for the fridgits set, my youngest son used it to launch M&M's (but that's another story)..."
1,Launcher breaks easily,"My kids used the launcher for less than two months before it broke. The U-shaped tube that pivots is held in place by two tiny and flimsy little pieces that broke from the force of the marble being launched. While the rest of the Frigits are awesome, this piece is to be avoided."
3,"Good idea, bad execution","Echoing much of what the other reviews said about this piece.It would have been a great way to enable smaller kids to launch a marble from a higher ramp... BUT the spring is WAY too stiff. It's too hard to pull down for younger kids, and it launches it way too hard. Sometimes the force of the marble even knocks down the ramp it hits!But you can get creative with it and even use it upside-down or sideways to catch a marble and channel it in a different direction.Overall, the Frigits set is loads of fun and my kids still come back to play with it after a couple years. But this one component isn't worth buying separately."
3,The only part of fridgits I wouldn't have done.,"We got a bundle of fridgit stuff. This is the only part I would skip if I did it all over again. There's just no need. It fires way to hard and the marble flys accross the room. Easier to just put the marble in and let it go on its own. That said, the fridgits are the best toy ever. I got a piece os sheet metal froma friend and mounted it on the wall. Painted it to match the wall and presto! the best play area ever!"
2,"Would be great fun, if it worked consistently.","We were warned that this might not be very durable, and it isn't. It works sort of, but is very inconsistent. The spring mechanism quit working properly within the first hour."
2,Nothing special here...,"Granted, I've only had this CD for 3 days. But it really doesn't do much for me. I loved Night Ranger in the 80's and I think Keagy is quite talented. I love his voice.But this album doesn't really grab me. I have listened to it beginning to end about 4 times. The only cut that really stands out is the title track. This is an outstanding and very catchy song. Too bad none of the other cuts stands out the same way..."
3,A Solid Performance by Keagy but...,"As a Night Ranger fan, I looked forward to ""Time Passes"" with anticipation. Though there's some good music on this CD, I found myself disappointed with the songs written and performed by Keagy's Night Ranger cohorts -- Jack Blades, Brad Gillis, and Jeff Watson. The songs that they co-wrote and played on were bland and undistinguishable. The best songs on this album are those written and performed by Kelly Keagy himself, with help from his friends Brian Bart and Jim Peterik. Songs like Time Passes, Too Much to Ask, and The Journey are the most memorable songs on the album. Keagy delivers meaningful lyrics and sings from the heart on these songs. It should not be a surprise, as Keagy wrote some of Night Ranger's most powerful and enduring songs like Sister Christian and Reason to Be. All and all, this is a great debut album for Keagy... the best songs being those WITHOUT his Night Ranger buddies!"
5,Frickin' Awesome,"Oh, it's been so long since I've heard from Gus Gus. Not since Standard Stuff for Drama. Well, Ladyshave is groovin', though sounding more acid-jazzy than some of the previous work. I'm diggin' the remixes. And finally we get the full 9 minutes of Sasha's remix of Purple. Que bueno. And lastly, Love vs Hate, a track from the upcoming THIS IS NORMAL! Isn't it awesome? I heard the album version of Teenage Sensation too. They're both frickin' awesome. I am very much looking forward to the release of THIS IS NORMAL."
4,Good introduction,"This book provides a good introduction to Event History Analysis. It is a good first step for people used to OLS regression and logit models, but it does not highlight the differences in using this kind of models."
3,"Pretty cool, but I feel there should of been more of a description...","First off, I think knowing the diameter of the Stout would of been helpful to know before purchase (it is about 1 3/4""), then gets slightly bigger in the middle. My experience with it---well, it kinda hurts. It'll take quite a bit of dilation before it becomes comfortable, and more so enjoyable. Secondly, the bulb works well, but it's quite awkward since it feels like it might slip out. I've considered making a harness for it so myself and my partner can enjoy ourselves without worrying about it falling out in the middle of the act. O_O The vibrations are gradifying enough, I think.Overall, well, part of me wished I got the normal sized Feeldoe because it's a bit large for me. But you know your limits, and I hope with the measurements you will know more of what you are purchasing."
5,Amazing Grace: The Stories of Power and Forgiveness,"This is an excellent book on the art of forgiveness. Corey TenBoom has several books on her life and this book almost reads like a devotional, Short chapters with thoughts to ponder. This is a book that you can read over and over and get more out of it every time. Corrie is so devoted to the Lord and doing his work and she talks about the hard times and how she got through them. She gives all the credit to Jesus and His love for her. This is not a ""one read"" book but one you can keep on your bookshelf or by your dresser and pick it up and read it over and over again."
4,A helpful book about helper dogs,"This book demonstrates the complex dynamic of helper dogs and their owners. It is beneficial to readers of all ages. How often have you come into contact with a helper dog and wondered why you couldn't pet them? They are so well-behaved and friendly looking - why not? Well, if you read this book, you will learn why not. Buddy the golden retriever is a hard-working helper, but he is also a good friend to his owner. This would be a great addition to any school library."
5,I Need It In E-Format,I am in a wheelchair and have a service dog. I have started substitute teaching and have read this book to kindergarten and 1st grade students. They absolutely loved it. I would really like to see it in e-book format. With my disability it would be easier for me on my Kindle Fire or IPad.
5,oh. my. god.,"this album is ridiculous. i think this band might contain the most talented guys to hit music ever...period. THAT'S how good this record is. their drummer is AMAZING, and their guitar player is mind-blowingly good. if you like grind, BUY THIS NOW. if you like metal, BUY THIS NOW. if you like math rock, BUY THIS NOW. if you like ridiculously talented musicians, BUY THIS NOW. you won't be disappointed."
5,Dethrones Calculating Infinity,"Need I say more?Well I guess I will anyways:Think of The Dillinger Escape Plan's Calculating Infinity; for the most part it was a technical bombardment of insane music, but at the same time it had some soft parts, some crude sampling and was as tight as anything I'd ever heard.Now imagine that, but more technical bombardment, less everything else and with the same rock solid tightness.Yea, it's that awesome. I've listened to this album 15+ times now and the only parts that really stick in my head are the weird carnival song and the explosion of every member of the band playing as complex as possible at the end of ""Death"".Yea, it's pretty sweet."
5,Unexpected pleasure,"This was an unexpected find compliments of Amazon's associative recommendations. As a collection of essays drawn from a series of lectures, Professor Mises provides a consistent and encompassing view of hisorical change that challenged the revisionist tendencies developing. What is remarkable in his presentation is his challenging the assumptions of academic attitudes that were only beginning to dominate. It is particularly illuminating to read his defense of liberty, as oppoed to the misappropriate appeal of equality."
1,There's more and better information in the man pages,Anyone with 3-6 months good experience in Solaris knows all of what's in this book plus some.
1,Very Introductory,"If you are looking for a reference that provides industrial-strength Solaris, this is not it. Practically all of the subjects covered by this book are cursory overviews. Disappointing."
1,Total confusion,"When the book tells us how to install a LOCAL printer, we are first told to give access to a printer before the printer is installed on a SERIAL port (Solaris does not seem to support a parellel port). Like the SUN documentation: a big mess and totaly ridiculous."
2,SUN should find a better book to officially sponsor,"I have both the Winsor books(Solaris SA and Advance SA) and the only good thing about them is that they are perhaps the only books in the market which are Solaris specific. I don't know what I would have done without the ""little red book"" (Evi Nemeth). Winsor's books contains some useful info about Solaris but the topics are not organised well, the topics covered are lacking in depth, and the lack of technical knowledge of the author is evident more often than not."
1,Not a very good choice,Countless typos. Plain wrong information in certain places. No in-depth info required for understanding of the system. The whole networking chapter is only a few pages (netstat command is not even mentioned). The author miscalculated on the audience. I'm not satisfied...
1,Where's the beef??,"Any system administrator who had to rely on J. Winsor's ""Solaris System Administrator's Guide"" would be in a very tight spot indeed; any querry into the index will usually result in sucessfully finding a listing, pointing the reader to a one or two sentence explanation of a subject that almost always leaves the main question unanswered. I understand the need for balance between space and the need to cover a subject, but this book is glaring in it's ability to list a subject in the index and then say almost nothing about same. While the book touches on many tasks, touching on them is all it does; and most of the direction this book does give is wasted on generalizations and things that practically any Unix user will already know. Much too simple for any administrator, and too non-specific for any Solaris user, I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone."
1,What book are the 5 star people reading???,"This book does not fare well against any other sysadmin book I've read. I'm new to Solaris, but quite experienced in the freenixes and BSD. I bought this and the Advanced guide based on the Sun name. Ouch. Don't make the same mistake I did. I still haven't gotten IP networking up, and there's nothing in the index of this book that I can find that says anything about installation and/or device setup other than modems and printers. All I need is to set up my danged ethernet card! Frustrating to say the least!I swear those users that are giving it 5-star reviews are probably Sun employees directly involved with this book."
1,complete waste of paper,"For anyone planning on buying this book I have just one piece of advice...DON'T. This was the first Solaris admin book I looked at and all I can say is ""this book is appalling."" It is poorly written, poorly organised, doesn't cover enough topics, and those topics that are covered are not covered in enough detail. Fortunately for me, I got a copy for free. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for such a shocking book. It would have been a complete waste of money. Buy ""A Practical Guide to Solaris"" by Mark Sobell instead."
1,Not Good.,"I bought this book when starting my first full-time Solaris admin job. I read the bad reviews, but bought it on the basis of the Sun logo. MISTAKE. Any useful information in the book is easy to find (and usually easier to read) online or in man pages, and useless information abounds. The whole thing is in a disjointed, un-fun style. It's dusty now, but I use it as a coaster anyway."
1,"Not so good as expected, want my money back!","After read, just got little about Solaris , it's for users more than for system administrator. Not so useful. Want my money back!"
3,Reviews are for a different CD,"Some of the very negative ratings given for this CD were intended for a different CD, Superman (Ultimate Collection). Some of the negative reviews refer to music from Superman III and the play; these pieces are not in THIS CD, Superman- The Ultimate Collection, but are in the other CD, Superman (Ultimate Collection). Hope this helps some of you."
5,"Not the ultimate collection, but a great basic compilation","If you own all of the stuff, it's probably the worst. However, it's a good basic on the music of Superman movies and TV shows. It primarily focuses on the Christopher Reeve films, and mainly uses just the themes from the other stuff. In other words, it's a great disc to start out with. Being as cheap and lazy as I am, I haven't bought the CD that I probably should buy, the extended soundtrack for Superman: The Movie."
2,If your looking for Original Recordings...,"From the Superman films, play, and the TV show then avoid this collection. these are rerecordings. And badly done rerecordings. While they do sound similar to the original. They sound like they were done by a second rate orchestra. What's sad is that you can easily get the original recording that are on this set. Sure it would cost you a bit more in money, but in the end you would be glad you did. After all, it's the original recording that you fell in love with. not these bastardized versions."
5,love it,great product......fast service.......would do business with these folks again...item arrived as shown in picture and will make a great gift
4,Excellent useful corner shelf!,"A relatively inexpensive but practical item. has cleared up quite a bit of space for me on my desktop, as it: allows me to file letter/legal size papers in the sides; i can store small post-it notes or any small gadget/electronics on the middle shelf unit; i can store magazines, file folders, etc. on the top shelf; and, finally it optimizes the corner space on my desk, which normally would not be utilized because of the 2-dimensional thinking behind other desktop shelving units."
3,Interesting and eclectic,"Wasnt sure about this CD, but the cuts sounded interesting enough to try. It has an international flavor with 4 Italian songs, a couple Spanish, an Arabian, and good old American sentimental tunes like Stardust, Moon River, Somewhere My Love. I wouldnt have put all those tunes together, but it is a compilation of various artists. Makes for a diverse taste in your collection with a lot or a little mandolin in every song."
5,Motivational music,My 15 year old niece recently began playing the mandolin. I thought the cd may have provided some good inspiration for her and it really has. She is quite eager now to play many of the songs on the cd and is trying new arrangements on her own daily. A good motivational gift for young players.
4,Solid story by Waid,"To Serve and Protect collects the first seven issues of Captain America Volume 3. The story is solid but unspectacular.The idea that a Skrull was leading Hydra and the plan he sets up are good though the idea of a Skrull being obsessed with Cap also seemed forced and a little strange they normally battle the FF. I wish Ron Garney had done the art for all seven issues as his work,in my opinion, is clearly superior to Dale Eaglesham's art especially in the action scenes. Still a solid volume that is worth buying"
1,"Yeah, okay.","I am so confused, did John Mayer play or didn't he? The writer of this book should've figured that really big John Mayer fans just wanna find out whether or not he actually did play at their prom and make it an easier answer to find. I am a huge John Mayer fan who knows pretty much anything that you can know about John Mayer and I accidentally forgot which schools prom he played at and so I checked out this book. I hated the whole John Mayer is such a jerk who only cares about himself thing near the end. Ugh."
1,I won't buy his works ever,"Honestly when a sports reporter interjects his ego over the career event of a lifetime of a budding superstar he or she losses my attention.Bamberger should have left well enough alone concerning Wei and the ""misplaced"" ball. I dropped my subscription to S.I because of this whiney ""sport reporter"" nosey display.Hope you are proud guy! Your name is mud to people I know."
1,bad writer,This book was absolutely terrible. This is several hours of my life that I will never get back. And he writes for sports illustrated????? Thank goodness I cancelled that subscription 5 years ago.
3,Not that interesting,"This book follows a certain group of people in the high school. There were too many people and sometimes I lost track of the characters. Also, the book wasn't as interesting as it may seem."
5,Good read!,If you are as addicted to this series of books as I am this is a must read. Emerging authors with unique stories set around Flint's initial premise.
3,Good but reeks of US propaganda,Great story but the constant super American hillbillies is very draining if you don't live in the fantasy world which is the current USA.
4,Grice as father of a field of linguistic philosophy,"Studies in the Way of Words, by Paul Grice, is a collection of papers by the late British philosopher of linguistics. His concepts such as the Maxims of Conversation and the basic ideas behind presupposition and implicature are vital to a robust understanding of communication through language.As a philosophical text, Grice's work is a bit difficult to plow through. His prose is quite full of flourishes and there's enough amusing references in there to keep an interested reader going, however the reader must indeed be interested for this book to be of much use. Anyone expecting to fully digest any of the papers in this book would do well to plan on reading it 3 or 4 times. However, if done successfully, the concepts you'll take from it will indeed do much to expand your view of how linguistic communication works.Rated 5 stars for its philosophical importance and 2 for readability, the 4-star rating given here is a sort of weighted average."
3,Dynamite Dud,"I've been around a lot of the boys who worked with Dynamite over the years and they all admit he was a hard worker and he liked to work stiff on occasion as he illustrates in the book. He was also a great ribber and it's alleged that he and Davey Boy hated the dog Matilda so much they used to pill the dog and the WWF went through several versions of Matilda. I liked the book for what it was, basically a ""poor me"" tale of sorrow and woe. It did highlight what Dynamite went through in his career buy I don't see what exactly made sheet guru Dave Meltzer cry, as he once said."
5,Perfect,"Buy two if you are using a flood tray with soil that has to soak @ 6""+ for a few minutes before draining..."
1,Missing an extention.,"The product image is misleading. The picture shows three extensions on the overflow drain, while the product sent to me only has two extensions. If I knew this I would of ordered an extension."
5,I love it,"This is the spatula I prefer out of our 7 or so spatulas. Just don't leave the handle on the edge of the pan like some reviewers (duh). Works great! Thin and flexible, but feels sturdy. Well worth $10."
4,"Flexible, Nice and Thin","A nice spatula. Works as described, is thin and flexible. Not for use on nonstick as it is rather sharp and will scratch (tried it on an older pan). For a wide piece of fish a horizontal turner is more convenient. That said, it is also good for burgers, etc."
4,"Handy, high quality","Excellent for pan fried and deep fried foods that need a bit of draining before completely removing from the pan. Very high quality build, seems sturdy and will last a while."
1,garbage!!,"I bought this fish spatula because it was from france and figured it would be solid. I used it once, put it in dishwasher and it came out with rust spots and worse, broken! Very disappointed, waste of money. Adamantly recommend not buying this product as well as recommending that amazon stop selling it. (only reason for 1 star is i had to rate it) Garbage!"
3,Country of origin,Although they list this product as from France it is actually from China hoping they will be good. I will keep you updated
1,Made in China,"These disingenuous 'MIU France' products are manufactured and distributed by Xinhua Corporation.Xinhua Corp started in Hong Kong and moved production plant to Dong Guan, China in 1988.-Built new factory in ZhongTang, China in 1991-Expanded production of stainless steel products in 1996-Expanded production of silicone products in 1999-Expanded production of wood and bamboo products in 2002"
3,Works well but the handle melts.,The turner works as advertised but a errant flame on my gas stove reshaped the handle a bit. A wood handle would be nicer.
3,Say No to Internet Tax!,"Purchased this item from Amazon and it came in the mail in good time. Cudos Amazon.Item was ok, not spectacular as I expected: I researched the item on the internet, decided that it wasn't a big risk, so I bought it. I found the spatula was ok but a little too flexible.The State of California wants Amazon to collect State Sales Tax for purchases made over the internet. Say NO!"
3,Light weight,"This works great for light duty. Scrambled eggs etc. But dont squish a burger patty with it or half will shoot across the room, half of the turner that is. yep snapped right of at the handle. Think I'll find a heavier one."
1,flimsy piece of junk,"I bought this to turn over fish and delicate items. I guess it works, but it is extremely flat and I wanted it a little slanted. To get what I wanted in this spatula I tried to bend it a little and it snapped immediately! Very disappointing. Not flexible at all! will stick to OXO."
1,MIU Slotted Stainless Steel Flexible Turner,Fell apart after just a few uses.Disappointing considering it was expensive and came from OXO.God bless.Rev. RB<><
5,xmas gift,It is nice to use great for turning things over wide area and a great handle. Light weight and washes well. A good item to have..
4,"Compact, handy, works well, and inexpensive","I purchased this turner along with the Matfer Pelton spatula (see my review for that item). I like this turner because of its compact and handy size and the fact that it has a slightly (you really have to look) beveled front edge for sliding under whatever you are cooking. Some turners of this type are almost double or more than the price of this one. I have used it and found it to work well. Some of the other reviewers have remarked that it broke when pressing down on hamburgers or whatever. I am not trying to discredit them, but must say that this is a turner, not a grill press. However, I do agree that it is a bit thin in the tang portion that is riveted into the handle. Accordingly, that is the only reason I limited my rating to four stars. Otherwise, I would recommend this item subject to its proper use."
3,The Handle is too SHORT,"The Handle is too SHORT. It would be great if the handle were longer. It's okay, but not what I had hoped for."
4,"Very good, but not really a fish turner",This is a well-made turner and a great tool for sauteing and stir-frying. But it is not the best choice for turning delicate items like fish because it is almost completely flat and quite stiff. I bought a similar-looking spatula at a restaurant supply store and it works much better for getting under and holding a piece of fish because (1) the end of the spatula farthest from the handle curves-up a little and (2) it is much more flexible.
2,It rusted!!,"It's hard to believe this flexible turner is stainless steel. I left it soaking in water for about 24 hours and it rusted. Maybe in France, their standards for stainless are different than USA. Oh well......"
5,Great Turner,"This is an excellent, high-quality turner that is still cheap. The construction is good, so you can tell that it's not about to fall apart anytime soon. This makes it easy to get under fish or any other food that you have to worry about flipping without ruining the dish."
5,For the price you can't beat it,"Handle is solid, and spatula part has flexibility to it-not completely rigid, yet clearly sturdy enough to hold a big piece of fish. The last inch of the spatula has a slight bend so things won't slide off."
4,Good product---slightly smaller than described,good writing surface---and it looks good too---flat finish cleans with a damp cloth. Mine measured 18x23--slightly smaller than described. Good product
1,"Nice looking, flimsy, but not for laptop...",I bought this about a month ago. I have my laptop on this and the laptop's heat warps it in 2 places. It is not very attractive anymore... I also expected a tougher surface. It is more like construction paper with a thin foam backing.
2,Don't Bother,"A very bland, boring book. Predictable, too-often-used plot that dragged on and on. Perhaps it would have been better if the author hadn't dwelled so much on Nixie's beauty. Or maybe if she had developed the hero's character more. Or if the ghost was important to the story (instead of a requirement for the ""haunting"" series). It doesn't matter, in the end, I didn't care."
4,Great boots,I highly recommend this pair for those who like too look stylish and at the same time ready for some action... It is lightweight and the soles grip the floor like magnet.... which is good especially when you are in a combat zone.
5,Cirrus is great dance music!,"Cirrus has created a very grovin' album that will get anyone on the dance floor! The hit ""Back on a mission"" (first heard on the mortal kombat 2 soundtrack) has a killer house style, where as ""The answer"" holds more of a Crystal Method sound to it. All in all, this is a great CD. If you like Crystal Method, Lunatic Calm, or Chemical Bro's pick this one up."
3,"OK cd, somewhat boring and annoying at times.","The beats can be good, but the lyrics are a bit ridiuclous at times. Found some of the songs generic."
3,the memories,"This album is alright but the memories are priceless. In a musical opinion I would call this a medium of the road album for EDM acts. Decent breaks, decent vocals. Nothing outstanding but nothing really bad"
4,Good CD,"This CD is not a must-have, but it's worth a few bucks. Cirrus has better stuff. If you get a chance to pick it up on the cheap, go ahead."
5,"Mighty Voices, Humble Lyrics","The Consolers are blessed with powerful voices that harmonise, a grand vision and passion to match it. Of my increasing gospel collection, the Consolers are my favourite."
1,"Awful, but with some nice descriptions","The more I read this book, the more I couldn't believe I had actually paid for it (true, I was getting on a plane in San Francisco so I could forgive myself). The plot plods along in incredibly predictable fashion. I couldn't have cared less what the mystery was about because it just wasn't original or interesting. The author's attempt to craft a female character is laughable and the constant aikido references are grating. I usually don't like to criticize but this book is so poorly written that I feel I have to submit this review. All that being said, the book does at times capture the unique qualities that make San Francisco such a beautiful city. Although he can't come up with an interesting plot, the author is capable of the occasional effective descriptive phrase. Take a pass on this one. You'd be better off picking up just about any other mystery."
3,A Disappointment,"""The Magician's Tale'' was wonderful. This is ordinary with outlandish villains. At times, Hunt captures the same San Francisco atmosphere he did the first time, at other times, he seems to be more interested in making sure Hollywood will buy this. Perhaps Hunt should start fresh each time. His first Janek book in his previous incarnation was by far his best. (He got a TV series out of that character). Kay Farrow is much deeper and darker than Janek, but Hunt seems to be going in the same direction."
1,Storyline Interesting; Writing Style Mediocre,"The plot of ""Trick of Light"" was pretty good with interesting twists and turns. However, the writing in this book was awful. I love books, including murder mysteries, and read about 4 a week. Nonetheless, this one was so bad, I actually had to force myself to finish it just so I could find out how it ended. I didn't enjoy it at all and that is VERY unusual for me. I would not recommend this book to anyone; even if that person does not know, or care, about correct grammar and sentence structure. Even the most inept English student will become annoyed at how bad the writing is in this book. If you want to read a murder mystery, with a stong, leading female character, I strongly recommend Patricia Cornwall or Laura Lippman. Both are skillful authors with entertaining novels."
2,High-school level writing,"I read this book at my mother's insistence, and was horribly disappointed--- both in the writing and in my mom's taste in books. The writing style is what I would expect out of the average 17 year old. The author has gone to great pains to create a character that (at least) he feels is unique. The protagonist's distinguishing characteristic is her colorblindness. So what--- it adds absolutely nothing to what little plot there is. This, combined with the character's constant references to her martial arts training are more irritating than anything. Although I hate to put down a book without having finished it, I simply refused to torture myself any longer with Trick of Light."
2,"As a book on tape, 'Trick of Light' is no delight","As often happens in the abridged books on tape, the book is too abridged. In this case, the plot was herky-jerky. I thought that it was perhaps the fault of the abridgement, but after reading some other reviews, perhaps not.Regardless, our heroine's motivations are ill-defined at best. Is it revenge, curiousity, the desire to get a story? Why does she think a camera is on a par with a high powered rifle when she breaks into buildings? Who knows?The reader was, at times, right on the money. Other times, she was simply too emoting, nearly maudlin. I didn't jibe with the images of her doing her martial arts, going after the bad guys with her camera and so on."
2,"A very poor follow up, after a great first novel.","I have just read the customers review of EBO@aone.com (in Washington) and feel that their review is right on the money and probably better written than mine would be, so I would refer readers to read that review also. I felt that in the case of the introduction of the characters, much seemed to read exactly like the Magicians Tale. I understand that characters have to be described for the new reader, but in this case I found myself skimming over words and paragraphs while in the first novel I hung on every word. I shall not be a reader of his ( or hers) next book."
1,this headphones suck,"i bought this item and the sound quality was soo bad, and the left headphone stop working the same day i bought it."
3,My Review on these Ear Peice.,"Ok so I wanted a quick cheap headphones and so I found these they look good but they sound very bad compared to other high priced Headphones. But I mean you get what you pay for... Am I right? But listen they do work, the sound quality could be better but hey! They are less then a dollar so there you have it! I will rate this 3 Stars because they are cheap and work!"
5,World' Best Praise & Worship Is One of the Best!,"""This CD continues to uplift my spirits, no matter how many times I listen to it. Listening to it is like being at a contemporary Christian concert. These songs inspire me and put me in a worshipful frame of mind. They are contemporary, yet very reverent. I recommend this CD to all of my Christian friends."""
3,fast shipment and good quality,"i am satisfied with the shipment and it's tracking.the product is good, there's no sorry from my side for buying that stuffregards,nasution"
3,Solid construction but made from cheap materials,"This is a very flashy Chinese-made knife, and it is something you would find at a Chinese antique shop. It is a solid construction, however, the material used to make it is very cheap. The handle is some kind of wood covered in black paint; the one I have has already started losing the black paint exposing the wood underneath. Opening the knife is not smooth and takes some effort. The blade is very dull out of the box. To be honest, this knife cannot be used as a tactical knife or a hunting knife. I guess this knife could be used to impress kids in high-school, but I wouldn't recommend buying it if you're a collector or hunter. If you're looking for a classy hunting knife, don't look beyond the brands ""Buck"" and ""Knives of Alaska"" - both are made in the USA."
1,Maybe if I were Catholic...,"Maybe if I were Catholic I would be more sympathetic to this book, but I hope not. The character Allegra, instead of being as a front cover blurb suggests..'a likable, unpretentious protagonist'...is instead a mean spririted woman who snipes and bites at others for no apparent reason other than it's her nature.Instead of being forthright in asking others about her mother's life she sneaks and snivels her way into asking questions and berates even senile little old ladies.The ending is amazing. Allegras final opinion of her mother does not take into account the free will and actions of others involved. God forbid,if there are actually people in the world as small minded as this character.Without doubt, this is one book I wish I had never picked up."
2,Bound by Catholicism,"I wish I'd read the reviews before I picked up this book. As someone else said, the main character is mean-spirited. She neither knows nor cares about human feelings. The author knows Catholic doctrine backwards and forwards, and knows how to keep a reader in suspense, but isn't conversant with much more. The ending was a total disappointment. Many details were implausible and glossed over: was she the oldest? Why didn't she ask her brothers about their mother? Why do people die so suddenly, is it just for the author's convenience? And, the biggest question left unanswered--is the narrator's father who she actually believes he is? DUH! The author needs to get out of the convent and attend an Iowa writers' workshop or three."
3,herbal deck,the images on the deck are very nice and traditional to a point but expected more info about the represented herbs. great deck just not what i thought it was
4,WWE Legends-Superstar Billy Graham: Tangled Ropes,"This book was very insightful to the life and times of ""Superstar Billy Graham"". I would highly recommend reading this book to anyone whom grew up in the 1970's and watched professional wrestling."
5,Tangled Ropes,This is one of the best books I have ever read in along time. The story is just heart breaking what this great man like Superstar Graham had to go through.But what I love about this man is that he never gave up.With the help of his preciuos wife who never gave up on him. With Gods help they made it.Superstar Billy Graham God bless you brother. Frank Gonzalez
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL WRESTLING FANS,"THIS IS THE STORY OF FORMER PRO WRESTLER SUPERSTAR BILLY GRAHAM. HIS STORY IS TRULY AMAZING. THE AMAZING PART IS THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE. HE TELLS US OF HIS BODY BUILDING, EVANGELIST, BOUNCER AND PRO FOOTBALL CAREERS ALONG WITH HIS WRESTLING DAYS AND ADDICION TO DRUGS AND STEROIDS. I FOUND HIS STORY TO BE INTERESTING, TERRIFYING, HUMOROUS AND ABSOLUTLY RIVOTING. I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS ABOUT PRO WRESTLING AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST. SUPERSTAR CERTAINLY DOES A GREAT JOB TELLING US HIS STORY. HE DELIVERS A POWERFUL MESSAGE ABOUT STEROIDS AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS WIFE AND GOD. A MUST READ."
5,Superstar is A++++++++++++++,"This book was outstanding from page 1, to the very last page.Outstanding job and life story!Superstar, a man ahead of all times!!"
4,enjoyed it,"Other than the chapter on religion, I found this book easy reading and highly enjoyable.Highly reccommend it to anyone who grew up with ""Superstar"""
2,label hard to get completely off,"Product is fine - I mean it's a plastic box that you attach to the wall.But, why, why, why, do companies have to put these sticky labels on their products that take an hour to get off! Scraping and washing, scraping and washing, then a trip to the store to get goo gone.There are labels that come off easily. Why don't they use that kind of adhesive?"
5,Great storage!,"I put it up on the wall over my computer/printer desk...holds any important documents I may need to see, and some excess paper for my printer! It's great!"
4,Pocket for Patient Charts,We use these pockets to organize patient charts outside exam rooms. It is hard to find clear since most pocket organzers are smoke colored. They're just what we need. Would have given 5 stars except we had to return 2 because they arrived cracked. However the exchanges with Amazon were quick and easy.
5,organizer,We looked all over town for this item and no one had what we wanted. We purchased 3 of these since they were hard to find.
2,Don't bother,This stuff didn't do anything for me. It was merely a lubrication and not very good at that. I didn't notice any help at all after using it twice. Maybe I will try a different product and see if that works. At least it wasn't too expensive.
2,"Gets a 2 because of price, shipment, and being harmless","Long story short (lol) I was better off with my usual lube and a Tenga. Tried several times under different conditions, just did nothing for me. No ""tingly"" sensation, even. The woman got nothing out of it either. The gel that is :-)"
5,Arousal gel works,"This stuff actually works. It's like a quick acting topical viagra. You use it to get erect, and it helps alot to keep you erect."
1,"Homiletical, not academic discussion.","This book evaluates literature and films in the apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic genre based on the degree to which they conform to a predetermined set of theological convictions; it is not an academic work, but an extended homiletical reflection."
2,"Not as loud as expected, like background noise","Buzzer has the tone of water hitting the kitchen sink with the faucet fully opened. Since it sounds similar to that, I opened on the kitchen faucet and measured the sound volume with a sound meter which was about 80db. Next I measured the buzzer from about 2 feet away. Even though the buzzer acheives the 90db claimed while uninstalled, the tone is like background noise so it is easily ignored and makes it seem quieter than it really is. It sounds about twice as loud as the water hitting the kitchen sink. Once installed it will probably be even quiter since it will be attached to a stiff wooden rafter that will deaden the sound. If there's other noise in the area, don't expect to be able to hear this over the other noise. This is not what I expected. If you need something loud try one the devices with a bell attached to it."
4,Nice Beginner's Project,"I was looking for a simple electronics project to work with and this was perfect for what I needed. The instructions were clear. It took maybe an hour to put together. I'm very happy with the results.A tiny negative is that the kit was supposed to come with its own solder and Elenco enclosed a note saying that it no longer provided solder with the kit.Other than that, it was a great product."
1,All Erase OK? by Coil (Japan),"Be warned. I bought this album stupidly thinking it was by Coil, the industrial ambient noise band of the same name, whom I love. This is crappy Japanese pop music. I guess it's ok if you like that sort of thing."
4,Easy read with lots of good info!,"I had to purchase this book for a class, but found myself pleasantly surprised by the content. It was an easy, informative read for me. If you're interested in Japanese history, this is a great place to start. There's not a whole lot on modern Japan, but there are tons of other books and TV shows you can find for that."
2,Bought this for class,"This book is incredibly dry. That said, it was required reading for my Japanese History & Film class which was a required class. I am (apparently) interested in Japanese history and culture, but this book did my interest no favors and I shortly stopped reading it and jumped to other sources."
3,The bottle is not 2 oz. I oredered it and got 1.5 oz. bottles.,"Rootone has been an industry leader for many years and I have no complaints about the product. The advertizement and the actual product should not be different as was my order, even though I double-checked all the data, I still ended up getting 1.5 oz. bottles. Perhaps it is the seller who is at fault. Either way, I paid for 6 ounces and got 4.5 oz. That changes the price drastically!"
5,New plants coming,I actually will not be using this product until next spring. I plan to start a new smoke tree and some others from some plants I already have. I was unable to find it in area stores and was pleased to find it on the internet.
4,"Nice unit, functional but a bit fragile.","Hi, bought this for my patio bar and am glad I did it's a very attractive piece don't let my title scare you. The reason I put a bit fragile is that I managed to break (actually just crack) one of the legs. Like an idiot (that would be me) I tried to move the table fully loaded sideways, didn't pick it up all the way and when the leg ""stubbed"" the deck it cracked. So my recommendation is simple, buy this you'll be glad you did BUT when you want to move it, move it empty not full like someone who is too lazy to spend two minutes to do that (that also would be me again). Very attractive finish, have received numerous compliments and inquiries about where I purchased....yes I recommend this table."
4,INFORMATIVE,This book is very informatiove to both the beginning collector and the seasoned collector. A great reference book for any collector. Gives you all the information on where to find the mint marks to what makes each coin different.
1,Review or recording,"If you are expecting to hear another recording and interpretation by another amateur aritst published by another unheard of record label, then you will recieve preciesly what you expected.The recording and intepretations provide another 'intepretation' by another rather unestablished 'concert pianist', lacking the profound musical understanding, performance and interpretation only attaintable by the greats.It is better to trust reputed record labels when buying recordings of these works"
1,SHAME!,"I saw the pragram notes inside the CD... LISTEN to this:""...for him (Scriabin) the inspiration of his 4th Sonata was a faint blue star, gradually transformed into blazing sunlight.."" ...And I'm wondering..HOW is possible to hear and feel Scriabin's thoughts when Mr Gordon plays everything from the beggining to the very end as loud as he can? Is this a serious approach? If someone sees the score while he listens to Gordon's ""performance"", he is going to laugh and cry the same time.Mr Gordon.!.. where are all these rests that Scriabin put for a reason.?.. where are the dynamic changes?where are ALL these markings that Scriabin asks from the performer? ..where is the rhythm? where is your ""professional"" taste?If you hear the 10th Sonata, you have complete sense of what NOT to do.. no rhythm, nothing.. only notes and noise.. Is this the great Sciabin? No, for sure no.. and this is a BIG SHAME for Mr Gordon as well as the ASV who produced this horroble recording.Shame, shame, shame...!"
5,Hot Album,"I've been listening to O'Ryan's cd everyday since I bought it and even three or more times a day. It is a really good album. It's not like most albums where you might like one or two songs out of the whole cd. With his you'll like every single song that's on there. I kind of figured his style was different from his brothers', but I didn't know how much. His style is more on the style of Musiq and some of Usher, but with it's own twist. You can just lay back and chill to his cd. There's not a lot of is any refrences of all the material pocessions he has. It's all about what all of us feel and go through with relationship and dealing with our feelings. You won't mind putting this album on repeat and let it play over and over again. I believe O'Ryan's going to be here for a while. If you don't have this album you have got to get it. It's worth whatever price you pay for it."
4,Off da chain!!,Dis cd is bangin... like WoW. The whole album is full of tunes u wana bop your head to ... the only thing that lets O'Ryan down is the fact he's tryin to hard to be like big bro Omarion. He needs to have his own musical talents and style... but even though its da same... boi u got game! I love Omarion and i love o'ryan... keep it up homie!peace out
5,Great Album,"I really like this album. As much as he sounds like omarion, he still maintains a individual style that will definatley have your head bobbing. It a really good cd to just chill and vibe to."
5,What's there to say,Well when I first bought the album I already knew that it was going to be a good album and as I said it was and I think everyone should buy it so I give this artist and his album 5 stars
4,New Artist Surprise!!,"Oryan's first CD really surprised me considering what type of record company he comes from. His brother was the lead singer of B2k and he has successfully made the transition of not sounding like them. I would recommend getting vocal lessons so that he won't sound so much like Omarion, because in some of the songs he sounds exactly like Omarion. But for his first time out he has really done a great job, keep up the good work and he will go far.Diva1"
3,"Good, but not special","Honestly i wasn't feelin this at all at first, but with a couple more listens, I was like okay it's not bad, I mean i heard worse. I think production was on point, but the vocals of O'Ryan wasn't all that. I mean he really doesn't sound much different from his brother. I read one review and it said it was album of the year, I totally disagree. But I respect anybody elses opinion. Alot of these songs I believe could have been done better with a better vocalist."
5,HE'S SO AWSOME,"ORYAN IS JUST AMAZING. I MEAN HE IS JUST A WONDERFUL PERSON IN AND OUTSIDE. I RECOMMED THAR EVERYBODY GO AND GET HIS NEW AND 1ST ALBIM ""O'RYAN"" CAUSE IT'S OFF THE CHAIN"
3,Review of The New Curtain Book . . .,"This book contains many ideas for curtains and drapes grouped in a logical order. As a drapery maker, I found it useful as an idea book for clients, but not as useful for the do-it-yourself at home sewer. I agreed with most points in the book, but there were some ideas that I did not agree with, as if it were written by someone who had not actually sewn the draperies. It had many examples of different fabrics, and, thus, was very colorful. Great for some one in my line of work, but probably not as practical for someone who wishes to sew some drapes for her/himself."
2,Misleading Title?,"I was disappointed in this book. The title suggests that it is a how-to book and I was expecting ""lessons"" in curtain making. This is not at all what this book is about."
3,Not for your average home.,I was looking for a book that had some practical ideas for the average home. The ideas in this book were pretty elaborate and very pricy. There was not one picture in this book that remotely resembled a room in my house. If you have degree in interior design and live on Park Ave you will probably like this book. But if you fit that description you probably have a designer on speed dial and would not need the book at all.
4,"Useful book, not only curtain but also ambient around","Book:Good content, good pictures, useful mixture with furniture and spaces. Helps ambient designers in work with clients to show examples (curtain are delicate topic, people tend to neglect it, this book helps to open eyes) .Delivery:Ordered new book, received one which tend to believe is used (picture also available in case are requested). In general weak packaging for Europe deliveries with standard delivery option (4 packages received, mostly damaged)."
3,It started out great,"The book started out great. It was cute to see the kids and Dale trying to get along. But somewhere along the way, I failed to understand what the conflict was...The romance was okay, but Dale had some hangups. I don't know what they really were - had something happened in his life to cause him such turmoil? If so, I missed that part of the story. I just didn't understand the big deal...The story of the parents was okay I thought it was a bit strange in some parts - a bit too Hollywoodish for my taste.I did like Annie's announcement. I thought that was pretty special..."
3,"An okay CD, but B2K still has nothin' on New Edition","Was anyone surprised when B2K broke up? I wasn't. I knew that they wouldn't last long anyway, especially with Omarion acting like a diva and all. I thought that you had to have been out for a certain number of years or have put out a certain number of albums in order to have a ""Greatest Hits"" album, but Iguess the rules have changed. Might as well make as much money as you can before it's totally over. I was never a huge fan of B2K, but they have some songs I like that are conveniently on this 'Greatest Hits' CD. Out of the ten songs on the CD, my favorites are: Gots Ta Be, Bump That, What a Girl Wants, Why ILove You, Girlfriend, and Uh Huh. I only paid $2.50 for the CD, so I consider it a good investment. I wish Omarion good luck going solo. Maybe J-Boog, Lil Fizz, and Razz B can form their own trio like BBD in the early 1990s."
2,Don't purchase anything from T.U.G again!,"Chris Stokes I see is still trying to cash in on B2K's success. Oh, well, but I know I didn't like it. They haven't even been out that long to have enough greatest hits. Chris Stokes needs to stop producing artists and throw them away when he's done with them. I advice you to keep your money close to your side people."
2,Just Ok&way too early for a greatest Hits,"aside from the R.kelly material I wasn't feeling B2K too much on a whole.""what a Girl Wants"" is a smooth Joint.""Bump,Bump,Bump"" was a cool joint.Girlfriend was a cool cut as well. the rest of the cuts are Hit&Miss at best.vocally they never quite developed fully to me."
1,Never received it,"The seller whom I purchased this CD is not trusted in my book. I have always purchased from amazon, but in regards to the cd, I have never received it!"
1,Greatest what? is right,"Nothing they've done has been great. Their music is annoying. They sound SO young in their songs....how old are they? 13? ""Girlfriend"" is extremely aggravating. And they sound like they have lisps in the chorus of ""Uh Huh."" 'Can you handle thith? Can you roll with thith? Maybe you can roll wiiihhdit.' (dont know the actual lyrics, and who the hell cares). So, no. Don't buy."
2,WOW!!,I can't believe they put this CD out. They have 2 good CD's and they want a greatest Hits album!! some songs aren't weren't even singles. I admit I used to be bigg on B2K but with this whole raz getting locked up and the fact that all they sing about is the opposite sex!!come on. each generation needs a boy bad(a african american one to be specific)and B2K WAS ours.
2,"Oh, Please!","I did not even know that this exsisted until I saw it on here. These guys basicly only had two hits and those were ""Uh Huh"" and ""Bump Bump Bump."" They had a few other charters, but those only got airplay on R&B radio. I mean, c mon! They just came out three years ago. At least when the Backstreet Boys put out a GH's album, they had released four international albums previous to it. Don't buy this. They were not that good to begin with."
2,Not as good as the original...,"Not nearly as much fun as the original, less for the inquisitive mind to do. We prefer Pat the Bunny, Pat the Cat, and Pat the Puppy."
3,The fur is the best part,"I have not seen the original (Pat the Bunny (Touch and Feel Book)). This review is for the one with the circular cut-out and fur sticking through. We also have the soft cloth crib book (Sleepy Bunny (Pat the Bunny Cloth Book)) which I will review separately.I like the truncated story and the interactive, tactile nature of this Golden Books edition. But the illustrations are a little odd: the children's eyes are set very far apart and the bunny looks like an alien. Maybe that was part of the charm in 1940? And good luck getting a real bunny to let you pat his tummy!Really solid pages, this has held up extremely well.I found a nice story about the author (by her son, himself an editor), on the quinquagenary (50-year anniversary) of the original's publication. See Comments section below for the link to the NY Times."
3,Decent read,"I found the beginning of this book (which has a great deal of action set in a very original setting) to be great. I was deeply intrigued. As the book wore on, I found that the greater plot (beyond the basic conflict of the introductory action) to be a series of very sparse vignettes that did not make much more than a skeleton of a story.In the beginning of the book, there is a great deal of time spent on describing, in detail, the actions and relationships of the central character. As the book progresses, it feels more and more allegorical. At the end (without giving it away), I felt as though I had been smacked on the head with a BIG FAT MESSAGE.I frankly read Modesitt's books for the story and the interesting characters. I found the story here interesting but incomplete and I found him to be far more preachy than usual which was disapointing."
5,deserves it's 5 stars,I read this book a few years ago and many books since then. But this is a book that I can remember every detail. It wraps you up into the storyline that is a mix between one man's life and a society of religious fanaticists. A great book to read and then read again.
3,You will like the hard action.,"The cover of _The Parafaith War_ claims echoes of Haldeman's _The Forever War_ and Henlein's _Starship Trooper_. The plot is traditional: hero is ambivalent about war he fights against hard-to-understand enemy; hero thinks too much; hero pulls rabbit out of hat, changes history and gets girl--we are in neutral storyline territory. There is a good complement of interesting props, and the hard action marches on without major hiccups, enjoying some good moments. Modesitt storytelling, though, is woody: the hero Trystin Desoll is flat, as are most support characters, and the contrast between the stilted secular and sacred cultures at war is handled with the depth of a grade-school textbook. This is _Starship Trooper_ many decades too late. Don't look in it for what you found in _The Forever War_: it's not there"
2,"Parafaith War- Interesting Ideas, Slow Book","While many of the concepts in 'The Parafaith War' are interesting: Quazi-Mormon religious fanatics, brain implants controlling 'modern' warfare, time delayed space travel, reverse racial discrimination, etc... the story is just too long with too many jumps of logic that it will put an end to any possible 'suspension of disbelief.' Besides that, it's just plain slow. Throughout an interstellar war the protagonist shifts through so many jobs that the reader can barely keep up. He's an infantry man, no, he's a pilot, no, he's a secret agent, no, he's a false prophet. While the ending did have a few nice surprises I fear most readers will have put the book down long before then, I almost did. Also, Mormon's and a few other religions might be a little offended at the parellels between their church and 'Parafaith's' antagonists."
2,Mediocre Sci-Fi with an anti-religious bend,"I picked this book up at a grocery store on a whim. A good chunk of the way into the book I figured out the evil religious society was based on Mormon Culture. This isn't an anti-Mormon tract; the book is filled with broad based anti-religious cliches that targets religion in general.If you are a Mormon you may find the book kind of funny, if you are looking for a great sci-fi book, look somewhere else."
2,I did not find it interesting.........,"Alright, I can not, say really what this book is. I DID not like it one bit. My brother on the other hand LOVED IT, why I don't know. I never finished it, and could not get into it. The story line looks good, But it just didn't grab me. It was boring, VERY boring, even when the attack came onto the station he was in, It just wasn't good! Just alot of blarring warinings and messages that make no sense. I see that quiet a bit thought it was good, but I am sorry, I Disliked it ALOT!"
4,Good action novel with some technical faults,"This is a good, fast-paced, action story that is an interesting read. The societies involved are fairly well thought out and the reader does not get hung up in the backgrounds, which, nevertheless, support the story well.Two problems do not detract much from the story line. The author seems not too familiar with weapons, even though the first half of the book depends upon use of military firepower, For example, the author has the hero ""switch to semi-automatic"" fire on an assault rifle and has the rate of fire increase! using more ammo. The opposite, of course would occur.The other problem I had was with the homelife and society of the religious fanatics being apparently a clone of common American 20th century society. Any religious society I know of has the fanaticism imbedded within their cultural interactions at home as well as when addressing foreigners."
4,Not so much a novel as a piece of Literature,"This book has created a world, a bunch of characters, and some motives for these characters. But what is most interesting is that LE Modesitt has created a belief system for these people that his characters fight against and come to know eventually.I was impressed by the writing in this novel, the story was interesting enough in it's plot twists and use of futuristic technology, counting only that, this novel was good.But then add to that the facet of religion, and the role it plays in bringing about the downfall of a culture, how one man uses this influence in religion to speed up this process, and how this book makes us reevalute our own values and you have a book that approaches literature.The arguments Modesitt makes arem't always right, nor on the conservative side in terms of religion, but all his points are thought provoking, and it is for this reason I suggest reading this book."
5,Michael Moore on Steroids,"Greg will take you beyond where you would go with Michael Moore. This is information that's hard to come by in the current media world, Mother Jones, The Nation, Atlantic Monthly all included. Greg is not affraid to tell it like it is and go where other journalists fear to tread. Hat's off to Greg for this book. I'm eager to dive into his next selection!"
4,Busted,"If you or I were caught influencing or changing 1 single vote in an election, we would likely go to jail for 20 years. Palast shows how the entire electoral process is fixed, yet no one has even been scolded. This is just one of a thousand points where there is absolutely zero accountability. Palast has better access to hidden material and connects the nefarious dots of the neocon agenda better than anyone. This book is mindblowing, even if you think you know what is going on. The problem with Armed Madhouse is one of tone. The glib and sarcastic tone, while a method of dealing with frustration, makes it seem cavalier. Palast is a brilliant and brave warrior, and I only hope he stays alive and well."
5,The Truth Shall Set You Free and Make you Angry.,"Greg, writes about what many of us knew from the beginning of 2000 and the rigged elections in Florida and the Supreme Court selecting George Bush as President and refusing to COUNT ALL THE RECORDED VOTES. How the neo-cons set out to destroy our economy under George Bush and Dick Cheney. By lying to the Congress to start a war in Iraq and take control of the worlds oil supply, even if that meant allowing 9-11 to happen.And the killing of over four-thousand American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.With the economic and financial crisis we are NOW seeing taking place with Wall Street,their Banking Institutions,the mortgage crisis,the closing of our major Industries, record number of forclosures,a record number of bankruptcies, and over 1.5 million people losing their jobs under the Bush/Cheney regime. While their CEO buddies receive millions in bonsus's and salaries.We come to believe that Palast is a prophet of his time."
5,Very good,"Read this book and learn what you can. Google North American Union in google video, Watch America Freedom to Facism, Watch 9/11 mysteries. Then decide for yourself how free we are in America, and where we are headed. If you are pissed off then get out and vote Ron Paul for President 2008 and help to get our country and our rights back."
3,"Read the book, avoid the audio version","The material presented seems to be meticulously researched, and clearly and systematically presented. The problem is -on the audio CD edition- the sarcasm with which the lines are spoken. The sneering, cloying sarcasm is so intense, so pervasive, and so grating that it detracts from the narrative. Is it really necessary to emulate Anne Coulter's style?"
3,Palast is highly critical of the Bush Administration,"Palast looks at the conduct of the Iraqi war from 2003 through 2006,the reconstruction period after the war ended,the administration of Iraq,as well as other events in the Bush presidency,such as the slow and unorganized response to Hurricane Katrina that had destroyed the city of New Orleans in 2005.Palast is highly critical of the manner in which these events were handled,as well as criticising the individuals picked by the Bush Administration to administer the aftermath of the Katrina disaster,the recovery and reconstruction of Iraq ,etc.Palast emphasizes what he considers to be the Bush Administration's incompetence and managerial failures.He definirely has some grounds for his conclusions."
5,Millenium miracle,"One Sunday morning I was browsing in the neighborhood bookstore when I happened upon ""Columbus."" To paraphrase E.B. White in his Elements of Style treatise, 'good things often come in small packages.' To categorize this work as a ""sports"" novel, a relationship novel or a work of any paticular genre is truly a disservice. The work is in the tradition of Salinger and Hemingway. The message it delivers is as much unwritten (between the lines) as is succinctly and economically stated on the page. I have thrusted this book upon three of my friends with the proviso that once they start reading, they must allocate two hours to complete the work. It is compelling, eventful and destined to be a classic."
3,Good first novel,"I thought this was a great idea for a novel, to really explore the emotions of brothers who had a tough time communicating and understanding each other. But as I read this novel, all I got from Joe Columbus was jelosy and pettyness. He had no introspection as to why he and his brother didn't connect, which made it hard to know the characters or their real feelings. CJ Columbus was interesting and possessed not only a baseball tallent, but an almost mystical understanding of the universe, which wasnt really explored enough. I did enjoy reading this book, that could have been a great book."
3,It was okay,"I thought this book was okay, but for some reason I was not as enthralled by it as ""Escape from Sobibor"". Maybe this was because I found it difficult to relate to the author of this book so much. It is definitely worth reading, though, for anybody who is interested in knowing about the resistance to the Nazis."
2,Ouch,"Well, I am typically an OXO fan and was quite excited when I received this as a gift. I am not excited anymore. I have used it twice, and both times I cut myself pretty badly. The guard is clumsy and doesn't fit all types of vegetables; and as another user mentioned, it also leaves a significant piece of the vegetable behind due to it's style and poor functionality. I'm rather surprised that OXO crashed and burned on this one. A better design for the guard could transform this kitchen weapon into a far better, more user-friendly tool."
1,Useless,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I purchased this thinking - as did another reviewer - the higher price would buy a better product. It was useless. I could only slice cucumbers (no tomatoes or carrots) and tried & tried to julienne but couldn't get it to work. Since I've never owned or used a mandoline, I thought it was me, so I put it in the box & stuck it on a shelf.A year or so later, a friend who is a chef came over & saw the box and commented that it was great that I got one. So I asked him to teach me how to use it properly to julienne. He took one look at the setup and told me the design was defective because there was no backstop to the height adjustment for the teeth. I felt a little less stupid, but only slightly, since so much time had passed I couldn't return it and was out the 80 bucks! Save your money and pass on this item."
1,Terribly disappointed,I bought this mandoline recently because I julienne a lot of carrots and celery and I was hoping to speed up the process. What a waste of time. I could not even get a carrot through it without a great deal of effort. My hand held julienne peeler is faster and safer than this mandoline. I'm returning it this weekend.
2,A good chef's knife is better,"This may be an exceptional mandoline, as all the experts say. But a good sharp chef's knife does a better job and, most importantly, requires a lot less clean-up.My first use of the mandoline was julienning carrots for chicken soup. While it did a find job on the first two-thirds of the carrot, it couldn't slice the last third. That last third was a ragged mess that only the chef's knife could finish. I think this limitation is inherent in any mandoline."
1,Dull after moderate use,"I cook for a moderate size church and throughout my cooking experiences I have used many different cooking gadgets. Although I think the mandolin slicer should be in everyone's kitchen, the OXO brand version does not live up to the reputation that has been achieved by the other OXO tools. The blade was almost dull when I took it out of the box and the julienne blade protrudes too far beyond the slicing platform."
1,Does NOT cut it,"I have a German V-slicer that works great, but only cuts in two positions. I wanted adjustable thickness. I got a Japanese slicer with an adjustable blade. It works great, but is a bit narrow. I wanted an adjustable blade wide enough to slice a good sized onion. I got the Oxo slicer. I have a number of Oxo products and have been pleased with all of them.It is pretty. It is sturdy. It stands on it's own legs. It does not cut. I don't know why I didn't return it. I got it in 2004 and have attempted to use it maybe 3 or 4 times. It is just too dull to cut anything. It is safer than my other slicers-I don't think it could cut my finger. It is fairly effective at making tomato puree and crumbling cheese."
2,not impressed,"Like others have mentioned, the blades on this mandoline are very dull. There must be a quality control problem since others give it good reviews. In my case, it simply does not work well at all. This has nothing to do with reading the instructions or inexperience. My wife is a pastry chef. The simple fact is that ours came with a dull blade. It is useless! Big dissapointment.I though about sharpening the blade but I don't want to void the warranty. It is only one month old so I am returning it."
1,Tomato Killer,"My wife stopped me punishing any more innocent tomatoes when the Oxo Mandoline, my chopping board and the kitchen floor and walls were dripping with red 'stuff'.Captain Correlli could not have played this gadget. It is totally useless and now resides half way up one of our trees 50 metres from our kitchen door!"
1,Oxo Mandoline,"A FAILURE OF A PRODUCT FROM THE NORMALLY RELIABLE OXO COMPANY; HORIZONTAL BLADE MAKES A HASH OF ANYTHING BUT A POTATO, AND RESULTS IN A GREAT DEAL OF WASTE. HAVE ATTEMPTED SEVERAL USES, AND END UP SLICING WITH A CHEF'S KNIFE EVERY TIME. PLAN ON A PROMPT RETURN. OXO SHOULD RECALL THIS LEMON OF A PRODUCT -- IT IS TARNISHING THEIR NAME"
1,Great For Slicing Air,"After months of waiting, my wife finally pulled out our slicer from its box and we eagerly made our first attempt at slicing cucumber and carrots julienne. Then we made our second attempt.....then third....then fourth....then re-read the instuction manual.....then fifth, then sixth....then we got into an argument b/c that's what married people do when a kitchen appliance doesn't work: we take it out on each other.....then i went online to look for more instruction...couldn't find any...we tried a few more times and now both our meal and our marriage is a wreck.For $60+, this thing should slice vegetables in our sleep. In the end we did it the old fashioned way: with a knife. Now we have this thing taking up space in our kitchen and it will be a cold day in hell before we pull it out again. If you want to buy ours, we'll have it at our next garage sale, next to the old toaster oven."
2,"Ok, but nothing like what I expected.","Overall, I'm totally disapointed.I'd like to kick myself for not checking the reviews on here before buying this product at the store for FULL price.The ""handle"" is useless, so I just push the food through the slicer with my hands, which sooner or later will probably end in a hospital visit.I have sliced some basic veggies without too much trouble, but not like I expect an $80 slicer to. I haven't even bothered to do anything but straight slicing b/c its obvious to me it's just going to irritate me.The ""dial"" that adjusts slicing size doesn't stay - I start slicing something thin, and wind up with half inch cuts by the time I'm done.I wouldn't buy this product again, and I wouldn't recommend it for the price."
1,Did not work well at all!,"We were so excited to have this tidy gadget in our kitchen--and after removing the plastic tape over the blade, were seriously disappointed. We tried sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, carrots...and made a mash of veggies all over the counter with a few julienned carrots and a couple potato slices on top.This will definitely be going back to the store."
1,Junk,I expected more from the Oxo brand. I was hoping the mandoline would make quicker work of meal preparation. The knives are dull. You have to wiggle the vegetables through the unit. Spend your money on a good chef's knife.
1,Hunk O' Junk,"Like the other customers, I have the same complaint...Mainly, the gripper does not grip the food firmly and does not glide over the blade (the gripper is too wide). It is very awkward to use, which makes you inclined to just hold the food with your hand...not safe. My friend badly sliced two of her fingertips because the gripper was so awkward, she just went at it hand held. I'm not saying it was the products fault my friend sliced her fingers...just saying it probably wouldn't have happened if the gripper worked worth a damn. Not to mention the food waste...this slicer wastes 1/3 of your vegetable due to lack of proper gripping. Slices of potatoe and cucumber worked well (although still wasted a lot), but like the other folks, I could not julienne a carrot to save my life. Pretty disappointed with this product. OXO - please take heed and design a better/safer/more effective gripping mechanism and gliding action."
1,If I didn't know my inlaws loved me...,...I would think they were trying to kill/injure me by giving me this Mandoline. I received it as a Christmas gift and was very excited. Opened it up to slice some onions and the could barely get it through the onion once. I tried a tomato and it more crushed than sliced that. The blade is so dull that is dangerous to use. Buyer be ware.
1,Complete waste of money!,"If you are going to use a mandoline I would assume that you are at least an accomplished home cook. You respect the blade and use it with caution wheither knife or slicers. With that said, I am a fan of OXO products and decided to purchase this one after my Benriner Japanese slicer of 6 yrs became somewhat dull. BIG mistake.The blade on this thing is a joke! It's so dull that it renders it dangerous,(its never a good idea to put a lot of pressure on any blade) a sharp blade will always give you a clean cut with very little pressure. It failed the most simple of task (simple slices of tomato, potato or cabbage). My old Benriner was sharper then this slicer which was brand spankin' new. I've tried sharpening the blade but to no avail. The blade itself is too soft and flimsy for sharpening. For a third of the price I could just replace my trusty Benriner which is simple, compact and easy to clean."
1,Completely disappointing. The negative reviews are for good reason!,"I was not completely confident when purchasing this Mandoline due to the mixed reviews. I tried making waffle cut fries out of a sweet potato and it did not work at all. The fries came out too thick to have the holes in the waffle texture (after turning the sweet potato 90 degrees after each cut). Instead they were merely wavy on each side. It was also difficult to push with the perpendicular blade. It left food chunks after each push on the waffle setting. I also tried the large julienne setting with a regular potato. Again, it was hard to push and left chunks of food. This mandoline is NOT worth the money. My mom's $20 bowl top mandoline works SO much better. After trying this product I will look for an angled or v-bladed mandoline. OXO gets a big thumbs down on this mandoline."
3,Not the best mandoline,"I purchased this because I'd had positive experiences with other Oxo products, however, this mandoline really did not work out well on a few points. First of all, I found the guard/guide for the veggies to be too large and clumsy for my small hands. The blades weren't as sharp as I'd hoped, I quite often had to really force/push hard to get potatoes, daikon or carrots through (even more difficult because of the issues with the guard/guide). Finally, part of the plastic on the legs and the handle area broke pretty quickly.This is an OK product, but I'm now in the market for a much higher quality, stainless steel mandoline."
3,Good and bad points,"I've had this mandoline about 4 months after reading the recommendation of a Washington Post writer. It has worked well enough, but I sometimes wonder if the Boerner V-slicer would have been a better purchase. The blade is *not* that sharp, although it does a good enough job on potatoes, my main use for it. It is easy to clean and the blades are all right there when you need them, but I have one big gripe. The holder/pusher seems to ""grasp"" a lot of whatever you are cutting, leaving huge chunks of leftover potato, cucumber, carrot or whatever. My objective is not to throw away 15-20% of my vegetables.Addition to review: returned said mandoline and replaced with Boerner V-slicer. No comparison! The V-slicer is sharper, easy to use, and doesn't waste large chunks of vegetable. It Sliced cukes and tomatoes with ease!"
2,Pros and Cons,"I longed for a mandoline for years. When I finally decided to buy, it seemed the OXO mandoline would be a good choice: trusted brand name, decent price, good features. This mandoline makes interesting cuts and stands nicely on the counter. However, the food holder makes no sense to me, and the manual explains nothing about its use, only says to not use the mandoline without it. That's the only way I've been able to successfully slice anything--without the food holder. I have such a hard time removing the blade for washing that I finally resorted to prying it out with a table knife to clean it. I've enjoyed slicing cucumbers and carrots; have given up on tomatoes and cheese. I wish I'd known these drawbacks before I bought and used it, because it isn't meeting my needs."
2,Not one of OXO's winners,"I am a huge fan of OXO products, so when I saw that they'd come up with an inexpensive mandoline, something that I'd coveted but could not bring myself to spend $200+ on, I was thrilled. But when I assembled and tested it, not so much.While I liked the design, its performance was completely unacceptable. No matter what thickness I adjusted it to or what vegetable I tried to slice, the results were thoroughly disappointing.Judging from the fact that other reviewers found the same problem, and yet again others seemed quite happy with the performance (which is why I decided to try it out myself) I'm wondering if maybe some but not all of the blades were manufactured poorly. A mandoline blade should be frighteningly sharp. When I pulled the blade from the unit and tested its edge, it was much duller than any of my kitchen knives.Anyway, I am returning this item and going mandolineless again."
1,Not the mandoline of my dreams - more like the nightmare,"It is helpful to read other reviews. I thought it was me. I thought it was the vegetables. Now I think it is the mandoline. I'm also an OXO fan, but this tool doesn't make the cut, literally and figuratively. The holder is a pitiful design. I often feel as if I'm risking my fingers' well-being as I grip the holder and drive the vegetables towards the blades, praying that I get a semi-decent cut of vegetable and not my knuckle. I also risk cracking my hand on the counter as the vegetable sticks and my hand keeps flying on by. I agree with other reviewers who complain that a major portion of vegetable is left to be cut when the holder decides it has done enough work. Folks, find another mandoline. This one will not make you love the kitchen."
1,OXO Good Grips Mandoline Slicer,"Don't go with this product. It has a much lacking design. I am returning mine and returns are a hassle. Even using their suggestion to cut firm tomatoes in a zigzag pattern, it won't cut tomatoes. My cheap plastic model does that very well.I am buying the V-Slicer by OXO. I have determined I need one that stands up rather than me holding it up and I have determined that the V-Slicer is the only mandoline that will cut the softer foods.So, we'll see how this goes. I would get the stainless Borner V-slicer, but it's 100 dollars...and I am trying to go less expensive. My plastic Borner is about worn out, but if you want a real cutter - and non-dulling blades, just buy 2 or 3 of those - if you don't need it to be self-standing."
2,not the best,"I have on old Borner V-Slicer that i was ready to replace with something more streamlined. I liked the way the OXO stores the blades onboard. I liked the dial feature. I really wanted to like this slicer. I was sure that the negative reviews were due to the inexperience of those using this product. (Using a mandoline takes practice.) I needed to chop four onions today. I figured that was a good way to test the slicer. After mangling and mutilating the first three, I switched to my old Borner V-slicer for the last onion. It was like slicing through butter after using the OXO. I packed up the OXO which will be returned tomorrow."
1,Don't Bother,"I have purchased Oxo products in the past and have been satisfied, but this one was a dog. The blade was not sharp and the hand guard would not grip food very well. The guard has these pins that are supposed to hold onto the food, but they are arranged on a section that moves up and down like a plunger. When you meet the resistance of a dull blade the pins would shred the food from the top. Very awkward to use and wasted a lot of food. Good grip in the hand, poor grip on the veggies. I ended up throwing it in the garbage after the return period was over."
1,Major dissapointment. Potatos only:-(,"I received for Christmas. And YES, I did remove the blue film. The blade is Not sharp. Every knife I own is sharper. We tried lemons, fell out of the holder. Tried Carrots, they fell out. Cucumbers only if peeled, if really chunky (and if it a reg. one) it falls out, ""english"" cucumbers only.Tomatoes, forget about it. a heavy chunck of iceberg is ok and potatoes. So, as we eat few taters and rarely shred lettuce it it going back. I will buy the salad shooter. I am glad Presto is offering them again. OXO really missed the boat on this. I will think twice about that brand now. I use to trust it with no questions. I have used real ones. The blade is suppose to be like a razor blade. That is why they are so risky and tricky. But the way the food slips off their grip/holder, you may well cut yourself anyway. Funny they show sliced lemon and green pepper on their packaging, yet we could produce neither!"
2,"Maybe in the hands of a ""professional""","I don't know what I am missing. The so-called ""razor sharp"" blade mutilates citrus fruit and bell peppers (yes, I removed the blade guards). Moreover, the handle is large and awkward to use -- good luck trying to julienne a carrot. I agree with another reviewer who wrote of food waste because of the spikes that stick the food to the handle, if the blade doesn't cut the food then the handle tears out of the food, leaving large tears through it.I am very dissapointed with this, and am returning it. I gave it a fair chance, but someday I am going to need to slice a tomato."
4,OXO mandoline,"I really like this mandoline. The fold out feet make it very sturdy. Most of the other mandolines I looked at did not have feet. You would have to hold it with one hand and whatever you were slicing in the other. Another nice feature is the easily adjustable thickness; you just turn the dial to adjust the blade, nice. Others that I looked at had lots of exchangeable blades. I don't want to be handling those super sharp blades much. Nice product."
2,Just didn't work for me,"I was so excited about getting this for Xmas, but I could not make it cut right. You can use the holder for slicing but it loses grip at about 3/4"" meaning your potato or whatever gets stuck in the blade and you have to cut the remainder by hand. I expected this to work effortlessly but it didn't and I am returning it."
3,OK Mandoline,"i usually cook this asian vegetable spring rolls that requires a lot of julienne and shoestring slicing of carrots, potatoes, jicama etc. so i went on a lookout and try out of mandolines. this one has a great design, safe and clutter-free. all attachments are in one place. i was also VERY IMPRESSED with the packaging. it slices OK, after a few clumsy try and the right height to operate it (im not that very tall).i gave 3 stars coz the safety grip thing is still too huge for my medium size hand and it needs a lot of strength/force to slice thru the blade (maybe IT IS that dull). it also wasted 1/3 of the vegetable on the grips, ending up cutting with the knife.for now i'm keeping it.but if im able to find another one (not the $140+ ones) that works better on the sharpness and handle, i'll replace it."
4,A Great Product at a Great Price,"I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about. The blades on this kitchen tool are razor sharp. I wouldn't dare try running my fingers over them. This slicer cuts through anything you throw it's way. Sometimes you need to approach the blades with a little speed going down the runway but it definitely does the job.It's true that you may not be able to slice the entire vegetable because some of it is in the holder, but that's my biggest complaint, and it's a small price to pay for avoiding a sliced knuckle or worse."
2,Dull Blade,"I purchased this product and am very familiar many with kitchen ""gadgets."" Although the design is nice and less bulky than most, the blade makes it impossible to cut a tomato or an onion. Very hard vegetables are okay. I do not recommend it and in fact returned it. My $25 plastic model, that I've had for years, does a much superior job. The key is in the sharpeness of the blade."
3,could be sharper but works ok,I agree it is not sharp enough. I found it a lot easier to hold the item I am slicing in my hand until three inches is left then use the food holder. The food holder is too clutsy before that. I am satisfied with the performance though. It is easy to use the settings and it is sturdy.
2,Sorry -- incomplete review,"My previous review complained that the blade on this was so dull we were sure we were missing a part. We now have been informed that we ARE missing a part. Whether it wasn't in there or if we just somehow threw it out with the packaging, we won't have a basis to go on until we try a completely assembled version of this product. MY APOLOGIES!!!"
1,Big disappointment from OXO,"OXO is clearly out of their leaque with this one. I'm almost embarassed to donate it, but that is probably all it's good for."
1,Not worth it,My wife wanted one of these so I got it for her birthday. She was so dissatisfied that we gave it to Goodwill.
1,Oxo Mandoline,"Item received with dull cutting blades. Oxo has replaced one, will probably have to purchase the other. No excuse on a $60.00 slicer."
1,OXO MANDOLINE,"This is an utterly useless item. Both my husband and I were able to run our hand completely along the blade with no ill effects. I was unable to find one vegetable that the blade would make so much as a crease in, much less actually slice. I have an inexpensive Asian mandoline with a blade that is razor sharp-even afer 12 years of use."
1,Oxo should be ashamed ...,"...for putting out a product this bad under their name. I own five other Oxo tools and I like all of them. They are well designed to do their job and comfortable to use. I have yet to find a single task that this mandoline does well and few that it will do at all. I don't know if the blades are too dull or the slot too large, but it will not slice potatoes, so don't even think of taking on carrots or beets. This is the worst waste of money in my kitchen full of tools. The avocado slicer is more useful."
3,Flimsy,"When I first saw this item, I would have never thought that the first thing that would happen is it would break.Don't get me wrong; it didn't break to the point that I couldn't use it (one of the lower plastic pivots busted, but it was still usable). Heck, I even sliced up a bunch of potatoes to make home made chips yesterday. Unfortunately, or maybe stupid of me, I didn't use the holder and wound up cutting my thumb on the VERY sharp blade.This slicer has a VERY sharp blade and continuously adjustable thickness setting until it gets to the shredder settings.I would have given it the highest rating were it not forr the fact that it broke the first time I used it."
1,"An ok slicer, poor french fry cutter",This mandoline straight blade is sharp and good for slicing. The food pusher barely pushes 2/3 of a potato through and the other 1/3 is wasted. The smaller cutters seemed sharp enough to work. The mandoline is not very good if you cannot easily push food through. I returned mine. It was not worth $69.99
2,Not as Good as the Borner,"I had a Borner V-slicer for about 8 years, and after much use, the blade seperated from the plastic, and food was getting caught underneath. So, I decided to replace it with a much more expensive OXO Mandoline. The Borner is no comparison. It's much sharper, so it's easier to push food through, and the food gripper is better. The OXO is being returned to the store today. The one feature that I did like about the OXO was that everything fit conveniently together, there weren't a ton of parts. That feature is not worth keeping it though."
1,Not pleased at all,I am not pleased with this slicer. I bought it to make french fries. Half the potato doesn't slice. It seems like the food holder doesn't let the whole potato go through the blades. I am sorry I spent so much money thinking that OXO was a good brand name - who would think that they would make a slicer that didn't work...I wonder who did the testing??
1,"Ugh! Love Good Grips products, but this one is a stinker","Rarely do I return anything that I buy on my own accord but I purchased this based on the Mario Batali infomercial demonstrating this product.When I attempted to use this product, the grip was awkward and did hold a chunk of the food product - the blades were really dull mangling the food I was trying to slice.I tried to slice green peppers and mushrooms - both did not slice well. I packed up this and returned it promptly.Trust me, you would be better off using a knife than this product! If I could give this zero stars I would!"
3,sharpening stone not included,"When we got this 'tool,' it could hardly cut butter. Before throwing it out, my husband went to work on the blade, and now it cuts onions, at least with the straight blade. We haven't worked on the other one.We had a hard time picking stars for this review. Straight out of the box it deserved no stars, but after some work, we got at least half of it to work.If I had it to do over again, I'd stick with the V blade design."
1,Useless blades -- OXO's big loser,"I simply can't imagine why this tool has gotten some good reviews from newspapers and magazines. My favorite locally-owned kitchen shop quit stocking it when customer after customer had exactly the same experience noted by the low-star reviewers here: The blades aren't sharp at all. It is no exaggeration to say they are as blunt as a butter knife.You can have the straight blade sharpened, but not so with the julienne. Since a nice, even julienne is one of the only things you really can't do sufficiently with a knife, this mandoline gets a big zero from me.It's too bad, because the body and overall design are the best I've ever seen -- much better than the French all-metal ones used in commercial kitchens. I was very disappointed to have to return this, as most OXO products are definitely best in class."
3,The turbo bomb,"This blade is okay. Its not the best and I don't reccomend buying it, so don't. It looks good but only the attack ring is any good."
3,Probably too early to tell,"I've been taking these for about a month. Haven't noticed positive or negative effects, but will probably continue taking them a while longer. Only a very minor fishy smell when you take them, but not to the point that you really taste it. No issues so far."
1,Flimsy garbage,"Nearly every case broke when I opened it. Black pieces fall off and the cases don't work properly because of it.Flimsy, fragile, useless."
3,Poor Packaging,"These jewel cases are pretty much like others I've tried. What distinguishes them is the very poor packaging. The cases are not firmly packed, so they bounce against one another during shipment. Two of the boxes were broken upon arrival."
1,not much to say for it,"The appearance of this case is retro without being cool. There is a tacky Targus logo button sticking out in front. You might almost think, someone resurrected this model from 30 years ago and called it a notebook case.It is somewhat misleading to say it fits up to 15.4 notebooks. The interior has no special sleeve or casing for your computer. It would hold a much larger laptop equally well or equally poorly.However, the solid molded construction probably affords better protection than many nylon backpacks. The handle is comfortable and won't come off in your lifetime."
2,OK if you have no other options.,"This is a ""everything manual"" lens. Difficult to maintain sharp focus, even at 500 mm and more so at 1000 mm using the 2X extender that comes with it. I no longer attempt to use it without a tripod.I think you will get much better results if you use a 2X extender on your 200 or 300 mm lens. That is where I would put my money as you would retain most or all automatic features of your present lenses. And, if you have a decent camera/lens combination, you can even crop for more reach."
4,my book review #1,"""Shattering Glass,"" by Gail Giles, tells the story of a group of teenage friends. The leader of the gang takes a geek under wing and everything falls apart.The book is extremely well written, just a little too easy, with a story of love and loss, joy and hatred, and mind control. Giles puts her own unique flair into her novel"
1,Bad book,"I read about 50 YA books a year, and this is not a good one. The characters are stereotypical, and the way the plot develops is totally implausible. This is a perfect case of a writer telling but not showing. The characters have no emotional depth."
4,Shattering Glass,"Shattering Glass by Gail GIles is an amazing book. Simon Glass was the nerd of BVale but Rob, a popular kid at BVale, had an idea to change Simon's life. Rob wanted to make Simon Glass class favorite by the end of the year. Even though they do not see it but Rob has control over his friends. As the end of the year and the prom approches Robs tells his friends to make some favors so Simon can win class favorite. These favors will later hurt Rob's friends and if you read this book you will see if they pay-off for Simon for class favorite. I recomend this book for middle schoolers."
3,Reality Check,This book was a real reality check. It made me realize how cruel kids can be it really scared me because I know that it can really happen. You have to be careful of who you trust.
4,Captures contemporary dialogue brilliantly,"An impressive window into high school culture and relationships, especially of young men. More boy-related lit like this is needed!"
4,An Unexpected Twist,"Although Shattering Glass told you the ending of the book at the begining it was full of suspense that grabbed you with the irony that this all can happen to you. This is a great book with a contempory edge.A group of popular teens in a small town try to ""fix"" the class goat, when in the end the class goat (Simon Glass) uses and threatens the boys lives and future.Simon pentrates the boys very lives to find their deepest secret to use to his own pleasure.The boys retaliate the only way they can, murder."
3,Not the best of its kind,"Though this book was exciting and insightful, some of the things that happened in it came off as implausible. The interview fragments at the beginning of each chapter were a very effective way to build tension and I enjoyed trying to fit together the clues left in them. Still, for a better book with a nearly identical premise (Cool kids try to ""popularize"" a nerd in exchange for computer hacking favors only to have it go awry), I would recommend Shades of Simon Gray by Joyce McDonald"
5,One of the Best books I've ever red,"So far I've read this book twice and it has surprised me both times! I plan on reading it many times more in the future. The characters are 3-dimensional, the story is very much plausible, and Gail Giles takes a tired premise and gives it a Gritty Reboot the way Christopher Nolan revamped Batman. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
3,Could be better,"I bought this unit as an upper body exerciser, UBE, only since I'm a paraplegic and am unable to use it for leg exercise. Overall I had higher expectations for this unit. The biggest disappointment for me was it is not bidirectional so the pedals only move in one direction. The resistance levels seem ok and are easy to adjust but the unit does make more noise then I would have expected in use. On a table or the floor the unit is pretty stable but the feet aren't attached with anything, just slide onto the tubes, so they can come off. I've also had the peddles come unscrewed and fall off during use, though they are pretty easy to put back on. If I had it to do over I would not purchase this unit."
2,I would not buy if I could go back.,"I couldn't get the hang of using this sitting down, so now I use it exclusively as an arm exerciser. I don't do that very often either, though, because the right petal unscrews itself with each rotation. I chose this one for it's low, wide stance. I would not buy if I could go back."
4,Great for home exercise,"I bought both this deluxe model and the basic model for rehab after torn-meniscus knee arthro surgery. Besides having the monitors, the deluxe model is smoother and feels sturdier while pedaling, has a smaller rotation diameter than the basic model, and of course less mobile than the basic model. If you can lift it to a table, it works well as an arm pedaler. It's short of a 5-star rating because one of the pedals unwinds itself periodically., and also the feet are more slippery than the basic model. A 24"" square of spongy rug underlay material works fine as a base over carpet or hard flooring. I would recommend it even as a general exercise piece for the home."
1,Waste of money,"Little tension and stiff movement coupled with having to place this on a very sticky surface to keep it steady and in place, which I have yet to do very successfully, lead me to advise skipping on this product. I was very excited going in, but it has not panned out as I had hoped."
4,inexpensive arm exerciser,As a Post Stroke survivor. The arm and hand require the most additional exercise the leg and feet get daily exercise if one regains the ability to stand and walk. So this exerciser is just one more inexpensive way to try to regain arm use.
2,peddler exerciser,it is ok wasn't what i thought it should have been for the price i paid for it. it does work pretty good.
5,"Excellent, a page turner","I seriously read this book in a single day at school. It was very involving. I, personally, wasn't dissapointed at the ending like some people were. I think it was a nice turn on the old cliche's of most romance novels, it gave credit where credit was due. Humans fear things they dont understand. It was pretty unexpected. If you like werewolves, or just like fantasy-romance novels, I highly recommend it."
5,I was lost in this book!,"I remember my grand-daughter, Star, coming home from the library with this book. I was unsure of it. Especially when I found out she was into this stuff. She'd talk about how wonderful the book was, so I tried it out. I read the first ten pages, and I was in shock of how Annette Curtis Klause writes! This book was deffinately different, and VERY interesting! Star checks it out of the library almost EVERY time we go to there, and she's bummed when it's already checked out. So, I've ordered it for her. I HIGHLY reccommend this book. You can really get into it. I did. And I'm sure you'll enjoy it, too."
5,Fantastic!,"I absolutely loved this book, I spent only a few hours reading it, and I only put it down when I finished."
3,What was the point?,"First off, I liked this book. I loved the way the author told the story, and for three quarters of the book, I was pretty sure this was going to be one of my favorite books ever.What I didn't like about it is that the story seemed to develop a wonderful relationship between two characters and then drop it totally, there was a totally plausible reason why, but I thought that the character in question was made of sterner stuff than that.The relationship that bloomed out of this tragedy between the main character and the male lead was not developed enough in my opinion to make sense.Also, I thought that for once I was reading about a strong female character that defied gender roles. But she wasn't, she ended up acquiescing (in my eyes at least) to her given gender role and it really disappointed me.Overall, I will still say I liked this book. But it would have benefitted from a stronger, more plausible ending."
2,Not for me,"My friend raved and raved about this book, so finally, if only to get her to stop talking about it, I read it. Probably the only I finished it was because I was stuck in the car for six hours. I found myself having a hard time connecting or even feeling at all sympathetic for any of the characters. The plot wasn't put into action very well and sometimes seemed jumpy. Also, just a word of warning, this young adult novel is really only for rather mature young adults."
4,Blood and Chocolate,"The first thing that caught me about this story is the name. Something that is as sweet as chocolate and as bitter as blood. The story revolves around this female werewolf, which loves the wildness in herself. She falls in love with a regular human guy, but there is something going wrong every time she wakes in the morning. In my opinion it is a book that really makes you think. It is beautifully written and has get descriptions. I completely recommend it to anyone who loves the supernatural of werewolves."
5,Gift,Bought this as a gift for a werewolf lore lovin' friend. He'd never heard of it before but was really impressed with it and said it was a good read.
4,I liked it but...,"This is my first all-werewolf-book (no vampires)and I wasn't disappointed. The details about werewolf ""culture"" were really well developed. The story started great, but somewhere in the middled the book lost its pace. The end seemed a bit rushed and left me feeling something was missing. It was a fun read though."
5,Better Than Chocolate,"A compelling piece by Annette Curtis Klause. I love the way it's all pieced together. Anyone with love for the supernatural HAS to read this. Especially werewolf lovers. The story has more than one line, running together, which makes it much more realistic. Another great aspect is the stunning invention of Vivian's cultural background. Great length was gone to in order to ensure that this story would be,even if briefly, considered by many to have potential to be true. Klause also does not throw in idealistic love pictures, like many authors do. She writes love as it is. When it's obsessive, it's bad, and when it's true, it's simple. Most authors cannot understand this concept well."
3,"smart, sexy, bad ending","Vivian is a werewolf belonging to a pack. Since her father (he was their leader)died, the pack has been at eachother's throats. Vivisn feels that she doesn't belong there. At school she talks to no one and no one will ever talk to her. Until one day a picture she painted was put into the school newpaper and she noticed a writing by a boy name Aiden and decided to meet him because he wrote of Werewolves so well it seemed as if he should be one. She falls in love with him. But when Gabriel (werewolf, tall, broad shoulders, arrogant) decides he wants her for a mate she has to decide which world she wants to live in and with who. Very believable depiction of werewolves."
2,So-so,"I don't know how this book could possibly have earned it's 4 1/2 star rating. I gave it 2 stars because it was interesting enough to read all the way through. Granted, it was a very short book- if it was any longer I probably would not have read it all the way. The characters lack complexity, the plot was just plain stupid, and the main character was not very likeable. Oh, she's so gorgeous and horny all the time. Geez, really? If I rolled my eyes one more time whilst reading this novel my eyeballs would've fallen out of their sockets. It's like a high school kid wrote this book; the writing was terrible. The only good writing was the werewolf poem. I have no idea how this book even got published. 'Twilight' is 'Hamlet' compared to 'Blood and Chocolate.'"
3,Too sexy for teens,"I would be cautious about recommending this book to a teenager due to the sexual overtones. Nothing super explicit, but it is pervasive given that the main character turns 16 in the book. That being said, the book is interesting if a little uncomfortable at times (Mom and daughter are both pursed by the same guy).I would be interested in a sequel if the author ever decides to write one."
3,how'd i miss this as a teen?,"I did enjoy this book. The writing was very amateur, oh well though. But more importantly there should have been a SEQUEL. She could have done so much with these characters and continuing the story...I think it fell flat as a stand alone book. I probably would have appreciated it more if I was 15."
4,Good Quick Read,"The characters were well developed. I wished there was another chapter just to give me more closure at the end but otherwise it very good. Vivian's mother Esme was an annoying character in that she did not care much about her daughter problems and was not trustworthy but I guess that can be expected of a wolf mother. I would love to read more about Vivian and her new mate, see where their new home is and what troubles they encounter there. The mystery part of the story was easy to figure out but Klause kept enough evidence there that I kept doubting own conclusions till it was revealed."
4,Loved this book,"I bought the book after seeing the movie trailer.I have to say that the book is definitely better than the trailer. It seems to miss everything that made the book interesting.This book has spicy complicated character development, who often do the wrong thing, that make this book so very unlike other books out there. It does have a strong sexual base which is just as steamy as any romance novel, only it is better because it is just loads of build up and none of the smut. It was more explicit that I thought a teen book would be, but if I think back to being a teenager, I was ready for it."
5,Blood and Chocolate is one of my favorites!,"I really liked this book. I was very happy to find it at the bookstore. I read it in about two weeks. It has a darker atmosphere than a lot of books I've read, but I enjoyed the ending. Now, I want to go out and get The Silver Kiss!"
4,Sometimes you get Suprised,"Two years ago I went to the local library on a 'summer-reading-assignment' quest with my teenage niece. On a whim I picked this book out of her pile of rejects, and to this day I can remember how suprisingly good a read I had.This book deals with the rollercoaster of emotions that all teens go through, but with the twist of also having the more base instincts of being a werewolf. There is some really excellent sexual tension and a uniqueness to the main character that has made me remember this book. And for a person that eats books for breakfast, lunch, and dinner....it speaks volumes."
4,howl at the moon.........,"I thought this book was quite good. Vivian is a werewolf, I think living somewhere in the northeastern usa with her mother and other family. She eventually ""falls in love"" with aiden(who's human) at first by reading one of his poems. Some of the other werewolves tease her because she is dating a ""meat-boy."" The hardest thing for vivian to do is to control her shape-shifting when in sight of aiden. That's the only thing I didn't like about the novel, because how can anybody hide that 100%? Eventually, things happen between aiden and vivian. Another werewolf wants vivian to be his instead of aiden's. But I won't go any further. Also, there is some sexual content in this novel, but not alot."
4,A good read.....,"I've bypassed this book quite a few times and it's been overlooked because of one thing....I didn't realise it was about werewolves. Had I known that, I'd have snapped it up long before now. How I missed this one I'll never know.I was drawn into this within a few pages and the story just grabbed me. It's a story about teen angst and love and decisions and betrayal and loyalty and just generally growing up and coming of age.... but with werewolves. I very easily got caught up with the story of Vivian, who has as many problems, if not more, then your average teen.This book may be geared towards a young adult audience, but it can definitely be enjoyed by those of us who are young at heart and can still remember their youth. Klause pulls off a sensual story about the supernatural without making it seem cheesy. The characters are believable, the shape shifter culture is well rounded and Vivian's world comes alive on the page."
1,Just couldn't get into it...,"I just couldnt seem to get into this book at all. I have heard great things about it so picked a copy of it up at my local library and got about half way through and had to put it down, I was disappointed!"
2,Not entertained,"I bought this book based on the reviews and I thought it was very disappointing. The way the book was written was also one of it's drawbacks for me, it kept switching from first person to third person every few paragraphs. I think there's better werewolf stories out there."
3,I'll stick to vampires,"As a teenager, Klause's The Silver Kiss was one of my favorite books, so I was really looking forward to Blood and Chocolate. I'm sorry to say that I was pretty disappointed. In conveying a pack, Klause involves too many characters, most of whom are not fully drawn, and I had trouble keeping them straight.I did like Klause's take on werewolf lore, though. As she did with vampire lore in The Silver Kiss, she took the commonly accepted wisdom on the supernatural and modified it to fit her own story. She created a werewolf pack that existed as its own society, with its own rules and traditions. This allows her depict Vivian's coming of age within the pack rather than telling the same story with the same human characters that have been used many times. However, she does include interactions with human society, giving the reader something they can easily relate to."
3,young adult novel,"I knew this was a young adult novel when I picked it up, but it had an interesting premise. The novel works out more or less, though its ending seems a bit forced and contrived. I found myself rooting for one set of people when Klause takes us in reverse, and rather abruptly. It's really the ending that I've trouble with."
3,"Good Writer, Terrible Outcome","The book was really well-written, but my problem was when Vivian exposed herself to Aiden. It was the most unrealistic thing I saw come out of the book. He reacted very unrealistically, I admit a real human being would be frightened -- at first. In the end, he would had come running back, rather into his ex's bed, which I found a bit disgusting and low in its nature.Although, I did like the pairing in the end. Some had a problem with his age, but he could relate to her and he was of her kind.I would suggest this for older teens, it may be a little explicit for the younger readers with some sexuality. If you're looking for a well-written book, then read. if you want something not overly dramatized, look elsewhere."
4,Capturing,This book will grasp every feeling in your body. Its amazing how youget pulled into Vivian and feel everything she does. The reader gets to feel her love and hate and her curiosity as well as her fear. The indulgence of sex in this story can unfortunatly capture everyone. I definately suggest reading this book.
4,Blood and Chocolate,"I found the book, Blood and chocolate, a very interesting read. It covers an entire range of problems faceing teenagers today from trying to fit in as the new kid, to thoughts of suicide. There are questions about sex, prejudice, love, trust, independence and coming of age, to name a few. the book is a mixture of fantasy, horror and romance but the author persents it in such a way that a ""young adult"" reader could identify with the many situations that the main character goes through. The transformation from human form to wolf is artfully done. the book covers many serious moral, social and family issues but still maintains its essential entertainment value, thereby keeping the reader interested. I think it would be an excellent book for 14 - 17 year olds. This would be a very good book for a parent to give to his/her teenager to bring up some of the subjects broched in this book for further descussion."
3,Blood and Chocolate,"The book is about a young girl who also happens to be a werewolf. Although it is well written I would not recommend it for teenagers for the following reasons: violence, sex and the use of alcohol by 16 year olds.The book is definitely not to everyone's taste and it is clearly not my choice of a 'good read' in fact quite the opposite I find it offensive."
1,"I tried. I really, really did.","I'm a vampire girl, I'll admit it. I decided to try giving werewolves a chance, so I picked this book up.If anything, this made me more ""team vampire."" It didn't make me want to read more about werewolves. In fact, I had to force my way through this book.I understand that everyone has their own opinion and everyone has different taste, but I don't know how anyone could give this book 5 stars, or say it's a favorite. There's no depth to it, at all."
1,I cannot STAND this book!,"I understand that many people like this book, and if you're the type of person that likes werewolves and vampires being portrayed as gods, you will adore this story. The descriptions are good. (...)"
5,Howling for More,"I first picked up this book while browsing through my school library; it was so good I finished it the same day.Having read ""The Silver Kiss"", I found this novel much more fulfilling than its award-winning predecessor. This is a story for any age level, and is extremely easy to read. Klause captures the teenage anguish of acceptance, friendship, and alienation in a powerfully atmospheric tale. This is a tale of the self-discovery of a girl caught between two species. Not only is this an enjoyable novel, its depiction of werewolf customs are also fascinating.If you like romance and action mixed in with your ""horror"" (which this novel isn't), read this book."
5,Spine tingling romance!,this is a very unique novel with the thought of a young female werewolf who has lost her father and or parents and now must choose between the pact of wolfes which is her home or a boy who seems to understand. a really good book that is worth reading it has tons of action and a slight twing of a bloody after taste but an overall life decision that could the main character forever. So which is sweeter blood or chocolate?
2,Trying too hard - not a great read.,"This book seemed to be trying too hard to sound interesting or glamorous. I found the story to be tiresome - how many times do we need to hear how beautiful the main character thinks she is, or the sexual tension in the wolf community? A little of that would have been fine, but I wanted more character development. Perhaps this is too much to ask of teen fiction."
3,Good werewolf story,"A paranormal romance written before the current craze, before YA was even a genre. Definitely worth the read. A little darker than some, but good."
3,Good but with a few irritations!,"This book was recommended to me by a lovely woman in a bookshop in Canada. I'd given her an idea of the sort of thing I do enjoy reading and so she reckoned I wouldn't be disappointed in this one.It's quite a 'small' book so it didn't take too long to read it. Although the story was very good, I found that I just couldn't gel with the lead character, something usually very important to me. I hated the way she kept referring to people as boy or girl and I felt that she seemed much older than 16/17. It just bugged me a bit.However, I am pleased that I persevered though as I found it to be an enjoyable read and well written by Klause. I would read others by the same author."
2,So-so...,"Maybe it's just me, but I have NEVER liked books or movies where the heroine is a stunningly beautiful girl with boys hanging all over her. And having her be a tough, in-your-face, nobody-messes-with-me don't-even-try-that-girlfriend stunningly beautiful girl makes it even worse. I do like strong heroines, mind, but there can definitely be too much of a good thing. Aside from the fact that I strongly disliked the main character, I did sort of enjoy the book, although the premise is overdone. There are some beautiful passages and strong descriptions, but aside from those points, this book isn't one of the best I've ever read."
3,Too mild to be suspenseful,The relationship between Vivian and Aiden was not as intense as it could be. Nor was the break-up. I didn't like the fact that the author turned her into a jealous girl pining after a boy who she knew she could never have. Vivian was portrayed like she was more human than wolf
4,Not at all like the movie,"I saw the movie first. Some of the names are the same but it is an entirely different story. The book is much better in my opinion. The teenage girl in this book...I really had to feel for her. She just wanted to be with the boy she loved. But if you're a wolf girl, things don't really turn out the way you want them to I guess."
5,WOW!!,"There has never been a better book, well, maybe Harry Potter, but this book is top notch! I've read it at lease 12 times.Great charactors, wearwolves, teenage life, what could reach more people.I highly recamend it!"
5,Definitely an AwESoMe novel.....,"This book is just GrEaT...the story, and all the poetic words Annete Curtis Klause used in th book...I couldn't stop reading it...the whole thing of this book is AwEsOMe...this is definitely a 5 StaRs book....:)"
5,A great Book,"I thought this was a ripping book, and is one of the best books written. It talks about a girl who lost her father and meets a nice boy named Aiden. She loves him, but when she reveals her true self, he despises her. I wouldn't want to ruin the ending for you, but all I can tell you is that the ending has a tragic and happy event. Its a great book for any young teen reader!!"
5,Must Love Blood and Chocolate(but we all know chocolate is better heehee),"I LOVED this book.I was kinda sad when Aiden didn`t accept Vivian for what she was.But I did like the ending.If only she could continue Blood and Chocolate to like where Vivian has a little werewolf baby. (Oh and by the way,Im seriously a girl Brent is my father)"
1,Blood and Boring,"The title says it all. I had to force myself to pick it up again after putting it down many, many times, the exact opposite effect of a good book. It's very slow, very dull, very irritating. The main character is completely unlikeable, vain, arrogant, nasty and shallow, she sounds like the ""bad guy"" in the story we'd normally hate, so how are we supposed to like her or even care about her! I absolutely hated this book and now I'm regretting having ordered The Silver Kiss before knowing I'd be so disappointed by this one! So much for the rave reviews."
5,Blood is just as sweet as Chocolate,"This book (Blood and Chocolate) is such a good book for teens. I say for teens because younger kids will get, well, bad influences from the book since they cuss a good amount in there. But then it is sssoooo descriptive! Whenever the characters kiss, Anette Curtis Klause makes it sound everlasting, well, like passionate. It is a real page-turner! I mean you WANT to turn the page to see what happens next, when you read it, at one point, you won't be able to put it down. I mean, it takes you to a whole other world with werewolves and fantisy. Bottom Line: This book has everything you would want in a fictional fantisy book. It's really terrific. ;)"
5,A modern Romeo and Juliette retold with a twist.,"Vivian is in love, but this is not a normal teen crush...she's in love with a ""meat boy"". Vivian misses her father, who was killed in a fire, her mom is running around with a new boyfriend and Vivian is just trying to find herself. A modern ""Romeo and Juliette"" recently praised by Seventeen magazine(although the book is 3 years old). Oh...by the way Vivian is a werewolf, so can she and Aiden overcome their differences? A great book, full of fights, broken hearts and it will leave you wanting more...so be sure to pick up The _Silver Kiss_ by Klause, a novel about mysterious stranger, with a secret as big as Vivian's.Waiting with great interest for a new book by Ms. Klause"
3,Par for the Course of Horror Romance,"This is a werewolf romance book. I don't feel like I need to explain more.This book is about par for the course of horror romances with lots of occult references, suspense, sexy scenes (but no sex scenes), and a couple of mysterious murders. She really makes her werewolves like wolves, which makes things more interesting than they would be otherwise.I'll admit that the horror-romance is not my cup of tea though I have read a few. I do know plenty of people would eat this book up. I feel like those people who would like this book would know that they like this book."
5,Perfect,Just what she needed. Great service and quality products. Will do business with again in the future. Thanks again for quick ship
2,inconsistent size,"I ordered two file folder hangers and I was sent two different file hanging folders. They looked like they were the same manufacturer, but one must have been manufactured differently than the other. I also had one of them damaged during shipping. It remains to be seem what the company will do about it."
5,Perfect for CLEP,I read this book the day before my US History 1 CLEP and scored a 71! What else can I say? If you want to pass the CLEP - read this CHEAP book!
5,american History 1866,"Great for the AP courses, used thru the year, and was great for the prep of the AP final Exam"
1,Warning: This is a facsimile of the manuscript.,"Although it may be interesting to own a copy of Bach's manuscript of these pieces for study, I expected an edited edition when I ordered. Bach doesn't use the treble clef and it's hand-written not type-set. Furthermore, the inventions are printed landscape to the binding making playing from the book almost impossible."
1,Can't agree more,"If you had any doubts about whether to believe the first reviewer, consider them assuaged. This volume is only useful if you want to return to the ur-text. If you want to actually play the inventions, look elsewhere."
5,Outstanding!,"Great book! Everything that a dentist needs to practice. Could use a little more on cbct, but overall very well written and easy to navigate."
5,An essential book for your dental collection,"I bought this book because it was required of us in Dental School. What a great resource it has been! So many great pictures make getting the hang of differential diagnosis much easier. This book is definitely a keeper, and a must buy for any other dental students!"
5,Oral Radiology,This book arrived on time and is new as stated in description. Beyond excellent customer service!! Will certainly purchase from them again.
1,Poop with a view,"DO NOT BUY!!! I'm getting ready to return the second unit I've gotten from Wal-Mart, BOTH of which have had the exact same problem. In less than one month's time, the TV loses all audio output. Picture still works fine (Hence the title of this review...), but nothing from the speakers, nothing from the headphone jack, just absolute silence is all you get. Seems to be some sort of manufacturer error, but nothing about it on Emerson's (the manufacturer's) or Nicktronics' (The distributor's) site. This is an inferior product."
2,wore out very quickly,This tv worked great for about a month then it started to act really funny changing channels by itself then the buttons on the screen quit working altogether
5,Great Sock!,These socks are the best socks I have ever purchased and worn! Very well made and very warm! Perfect for the cooler months ahead. Thumbs up!
1,CAREFUL! The size given is incorrect.,"Notice that the product name includes ""Size 10-12"" while the size selection clearly indicates size 9-11. These are in fact the 10-12 socks. Silly me, I went by the size selection. Now I'm stuck with several pairs of socks that are WAY too big."
2,Poor Quality,I've worn Gold Toe socks for years because of the quality. I got holes in the socks the first time I put them on because of my fingers. I don't have long fingernails. That was definitely not the quality I'm used to with Gold Toe socks.
1,"lies, lies in ad for Gold Toe Women's Plus 10-12 (brown)","The ad states 10-12 and unlike V.K. Williams, I received size 9-11. What the hell, Amazon! I am very upset!"
5,Well done!,"I found this how-to book to be very easy to read with many clearly written tutorials. It starts off with a good foundational explanation of illustrating with vector graphics, then a comparative explanation of the other comparable illustration programs, it then gives an explanation of MX 2004's newest features. The many tutorials take the reader through various illustration basics as they apply to this latest version of Flash MX. The step-by-step tutorials, along with the suggested illustration techniques, are the highlight of this book. The included tutorial CD complements the contents of the book and allows the reader to ""test-drive"" their newly learned illustration skills with a trial copy of the software. Overall, an excellent resource for those who want to develop or expand their illustration skills using Macromedia's Flash MX 2004!"
4,"A ""different"" translation","Contains extensive introductory information, including discussion of recent archeoligical discoveries, and interesting endnotes (although I prefer footnotes - less fumbling with pages).However, I found this translation to be a bit difficult. One of the reviewers on the back of the book refers to it as ""poetic"" - well, maybe; mostly I found it a bit of a struggle to make sense of it, and had to read through it with several parallel translations to figure out what Roberts was translating. However, in that situation, read with several parallel translations, this translation provides an worthwhile ""spin"". I find Mair's translation much cleaner, simpler, and more comprehensible. The two together are nice."
3,"Good overall, but don't buy as your first translation!","This is by no means a bad translation.But the translator clearly sacrifices clarity of meaning for preservation of poetry and rhythm.For that reason, I would recommend this book only if it isn't your first copy of a translation of the Dao De Jing."
1,On China and the Progressives Effort to Redefine Logic as Solely Mathematical,"It appears as though we have an effort from China and the progressives to claim and redefine and act as if they think in the manner that logic is solely defined by mathematics in order to have China remove the minds of the white males, force communism on them and have them serve the progressives with mathematical minds while the progressives propogate evil on them and then China forces the white males to take the blame for the evil.Logic is wise, not mathematical. Love is logical, not mathematical. Pleasure is logical, not mathematical. Morality is logical, not mathematical. Happiness is logical, not mathematical."
1,Don't buy this hunk of junk.,THere is no interface with this surround sound unit besides the remote. After 1 month of owning this unit I try to turn it on with the remote. 5 seconds later it automatically shuts off and wont turn on again for an hour or so for another 5 to 10 seconds of surround sound. There is no product support. Go to their website and try to dial customer support. YOu will hear a loooong beeping sound in your ear. Try to send them an email from their website and you will get an error message or a page cannot be displayed. All and all..a big waste of my precious time and money. If the store won't take this thing back. I'm putting it on Ebay.
3,French Dictionary,The mercahndise was delivered in a timely manner. The product was not in as good condition as was indicated.
4,Solid foundation of lighting!,I found this DVD clear and straight to the point. This instructional DVD unlike others I have viewed is one to be watched over and over with out being annoying. This DVD is awesome for a 3D users getting started and for others 3d users maybe pros in one field and want to branch out into the world of lighting in SoftImage.Oh yeah this would be 5 stars but hoping to have a little more interactive-ness with sweet beats on the intro main menu and maybe an Easter egg or 2. You know fun little DVD things.I have read other advanced tutorials from this author. I hope in the future he produces a Mental Ray advanced topics in lighting DVD.Anyways like I said straight to the point and great to watch!!!!
4,CANINE LOVERS WILL GET MORE THAN A FEW CHUCKLES !,"Dogs can do the craziest things at the most unsuspecting time. Others plan their day accordingly. I have an English Cocker Spaniel who all but leaps through the drive-through window of his favourite do-nut shop, and has been known to devour the bag with those little ""bits"" still inside! The staff all know him and he takes great delight in flaunting his fame, not to mention basking in all the attention he receives. A dog's life, as portrayed through this book, will bring a fair share of chuckles to your day. It's cute, amusing and sometimes just plain silly..but that's exactly what our little canine friends are, isn't it? Ahh, but to live a pampered dog's life!"
4,Summertime Doesn't Get Better Than This,"I have read this book time and time again. Ellen Conford's characters are incredibly realistic and easy to relate to. Since I attended several camps each summer of my childhood and youth, 'Hail, Hail, Camp Timberwood' became the experience to strive for. Like most girls, I too wanted a romantic camp relationship! The only way to express how much I love this novel is to confess that this was one of the books I brought with me to college! When life becomes too hectic or complicated, I enjoy returning to Conford's world where average worries include adolescent crushes and camp food."
3,Not amazing... but does get the job done,"I might have had too high of hopes for this tool. I was replacing a headphone amp by instead running this off of an existing monitor speaker cable. According to the description, this should have been the PERFECT application. Unfortunately the amp level that worked great for a speaker was WAY too LOW(?) for this headphone tap. I had to move the amp level from about 35% to 75% to even make this box work adequately.Not the ideal situation because now I can't hook up an actual monitor to this line since it will be extremely loud."
3,Yakima Lock Cores,"Horribly expensive, but they work. Easy to remove old lock cores, whose keys are lost, and to replace them with new, lockable cores. 2 new keys included."
5,Great accessory for 2009 Honda Element EX,"I recently installed these lock cores (part 8007204) with a complete roof rack set from Yakima. These fit into the control tower openings without issue, and provide some comfort that your roof racks are secured."
4,ok but pricey,"I bought these a month ago along with two ""frontloader"" racks. As others have said these are good for keeping would be thieves honest as they lock the knob that loosens the rack to the crossbars (if someone really wants to steal your bike they will rip the whole thing out, and damage your car). Overall I'm happy with them, two comments though. One they seem a bit pricey to me for what they're intended for. Two, when installing these I struggled for about half an hour until I realized that yakima had sent the wrong keys! This is probably rare but when you get them check that the A# etched on the lock matches the one on the keys. I ended up calling Yakima and their customer service was great. They apologized and mailed the right set within a couple of days."
5,Product does it's job,"You really don't have much choices when it comes to parts or locks. I got this to give thiefs a little deterrent for during day time. I go snowboarding so I use the locks and I don't think anyone is going to go that far during day light when there's people walking by to pry the roof rack off your car. During night or otherwise not in use I remove the rack and leave it at home. So I'd say the locks are good at keeping you that much more at ease. On top of it, it's also another reassurance that your roof rack stays bolted down to your roof and doesn't come loose."
5,Lock em up.,I now have my whole Yakima Q Tower set and bike rails locked to my car nice and tight. Makes you feel a lot better about having so much money just sitting on the top of you car.
5,Great!,Added security to protect my surf racks. Bought the 8-pack because I have racks on 2 cars and love having one key fit them both. Stainless steel to protect from rust and they were easy to install in less than 5 minutes!
3,Good locks,"The Yakima SKS Locks really should come with the racks. Making them à la carte really chaps. But they do work well as intended, keeping the bike from being walked away with."
1,Didn't stop a rack thief.,"I had Q-Towers and Q-Clips on a 2010 Prius, and installed the SKS lock cores to make sure nobody stole them.Now I have a car with dents and scratches all over the roof, because they used a crowbar and stole them regardless.Lesson learned. Get permament racks, like the Landing Pad series, if you live in a big city. Or take your racks off when not in use, because these so-called ""locks"" aren't gonna do jack shoot to keep your racks on your car if somebody really, really wants to take them.Sad face. Teardrop."
2,Good info but seriously outdated,"Written in 1990, ridden on no-suspension bikes, travels the wrong direction for most (Moab to Loma), trail has changed considerably (about 12 miles) since published - not accurate! This is badly in need of an update.That's the bad. The good is very detailed mile-by-mile breakdown (when accurate) and does an admirable job condensing a very long trail. Also has accompanying (purchase seperately) trailmap good for planning purposes, but also outdated & flimsy.Be careful trying to ride the trail based on this guide."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This is an omnibus edition of three books. Woundhealer's Story, Sightbinder's Story and Stonecutter's Story, or the first, second and third books of lost swords.In general, I found these stories fairly dull. Prince Mark runs around, with the swords ominpresent, seeing what they can do."
2,Disappointed,"I must admit it's been a couple of years since I read this and I frankly can't remember it very well at all. But I do remember being disappointed. I recall plodding through it, waiting, searching, and coming up empty-handed. Perhaps it just wasn't what I was looking for in an analysis of Tolkien's Catholicism within his works. To each his own ~ this one definitely didn't speak to me at all."
2,Not quite the Catholic study of Tolkien we've been wanting,"This is almost the Catholic study of Tolkien we've been waiting for. But not quite. Though diligently researched, with 800 footnotes, it somehow manages not to engage with its subject very much. Birzer says occasional odd things like describing ""Mythopoeia"" as ""a poem written to celebrate"" Lewis's conversion, surely the wrong word, and claiming that Ilúvatar bypassed the Valar in destroying Númenor. I found it diffuse and nowhere near as interesting as I'd hoped."
4,cute little lamp,"At first, I was a little concerned about the fuzzy material with the heat source but it acts as a nice gentle reading light for a child."
3,Joshua Loper Reveiw,This story is based after the civil war. Joshua and Doom are the only black people on the herd. They start out in the very back at drags but joshua moves to the front when one man slips up. There are some you could say sad parts like when joshuas horse dies but there are some good parts like when he is asked to go on another trail from texas to oregon.
3,OKAY BUT NOT GREAT!,"I read all of this MY NAME IS AMERICA book. But like some of the other books in this series, it lacked excitement, suspense, and was not entirely accurate. I did not feel that the book was written by a 16 yr. old cowboy, though it kept my interest and gives children a feeling of what it was like to live in the 19th century. Much better and more accurate historical novels are THE JOURNEY OF LEROY JONES, A FUGITIVE SLAVE and THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO."
3,The Black Cowboy,"Joshua Loper and seven others are driving a herd. Joshua is pushed harder by the captain of the drive because of his race.In the end Joshua is one of the best known herders and in the end gets paid the most money because of his hardwork. The captain and Joshua have more respect for one another at the end of their trip.I have two opinions about the book good opinion it is very discriptive well written, exciting, and enjoyable. Another opinion is the rambledon and on about things I thought were less interesting to me"
2,named but not known,"I bought ""The Journal of Joshua Loper"" hoping to read a true account of a cowboy. I did not have to reach page 158 to notice that the ""journal is a work of fiction."" While the library research was quite extensive, he missed the realities and language of the culture. No normal, free young man in a ranching environment would still be fumbling with a rope at 16. He would have a good handle on it by age 11.I cannot imagine a South Texas cowboy of that era calling men ""guys"", black people ""colored"" and horses ""animals"". These terms are more midwestern, perhaps more educated than was common among the people of that time.Finally within a week of Austin he has blacks picking cotton in May. Cotton might be picked in August, but even in Texas, cotton takes a while to mature after it is planted.The one thing that saves this book is the humor. Otherwise, it is the college description of a description. For the real thing read the real thing, or better yet, do it."
3,The Journal of Joshua Loper,"This is a story about an adventurous 16 year old boy. He is a boy who wants to have more adventure. A coincidence was that he got to go on the Chisholm Trail. He worked as a cowboy. The Chisholm Trail is from Texas to Abilene,Kansas. Once a boy goes on the trail he become a man. What will the hardships be for Joshua? To find out you should read this book."
4,Holds a lot in a limited space.,"I had limited space on a shallow bookshelf over my home desk that I wanted to use to sort and hold incoming papers - financial, medical, correspondence, etc. - until I could act on them. This fit perfectly (it doesn't hang out over the edge of the 9"" shelf), is visually unobtrusive, and is very convenient. It could also be used freestanding on the desk if you have room there.Rubbermaid 96080 File folder/organizer rack, clear plastic, 13-1/8w x 5-7/8d x 13-5/8h"
5,A definite Keeper!! Money well spent and then some.,This story is very real and well written. The chemistry between Jaunie and Trenton is hot. And we also have several little mysteries along the way to keep one aptly entertained. She also tackles some serious topics like child runaways but in away that fits with the plot of the story. A definite must read.
2,Could have been more interesting,"I'm a fan of what Anthony Robbins does - trying to teach people to better themselves. If we had learned this stuff at school we would all be much happier as adults. This doco is low format, made for TV and could have been much more insightful with decent journalism. The thing I remember most is Anthony's Mum's BIG Hair:)"
3,Not really about technology,"If you are interested in the philosophy of technology, skip this book and keep looking. Borgmann defines technology as developments since the industrial revolution. Many of his claims may stand within this narrow definition of technology but lose their force when considering technology in a broader sense.Rather than a critique of technology, the book actually critiques consumerism. In this, the book is thought-provoking and worth reading. Although Borgmann assumes (incorrectly, I believe) a linkage between technology and consumerism, the linkage is not necessary to the critique of consumerism. Unfortunately, like most social critics, Borgmann does not present tangible suggestions for changing course."
3,Take with precaution,"When taken as directed, I get headache and nausea every time I pop this in. Please take with precaution. Consume as much liquid as possible if you must use this product."
5,Masterfully done!,"I have read this book so many times that I am embarrassed to admit how much. On the surface it seems simple but every read provides a different and actual more complex, but pleasing layer. I enjoyed it the first time and devoured it on the tenth! Well worth the read....again and again."
5,What a romance book should be,"Lady Julia Markham has no chance of a good marriage. Brader Wolf is man who made his money, so the chances of marry a member of society are zero. But each has something the other could use, so they agree to marry. But both Brader and Julia are carrying scars from their past, but they must work together to ease the pain and have a future together.""All things Beautiful"" is the the third book by Cathy Maxwell I read, it the best! Both of the main characters are people that belong to but just don't realize it. Ms. Maxwell bring read feelings in these two characters and makes the reader want more. I have to confess that it only took me a day to read this book and I was sorry that it ended!"
5,One of the best books ever!,"It's a pity this is out of print, because it is one of the best romances ever written. No boring, cliched regency set histroical here. This one is a masterpiece without equal. Brader is so wondrful that words can not describe him. If you like romance, do yourself a favor and seek out used bookstores until you find it!"
1,Beware - this is not a self-ballasted lamp,"This lamp may be a perfectly fine lamp. However, from the description and the picture you probably assume that this lamp can be used anywhere a mogul-based incandescent can be used. This lamp can only be used in fluorescent 65-watt fixtures with ballast. The lamp itself does not have a ballast. The 1 star relates to the poor job of describing the lamp, rather than the quality of the lamp itself."
1,I agree with the first review,"It looked as if you could just screw it in and light up, but NO, you need a special fixture to put it in."
2,poor packaging,I never got to try these bulbs. They were so poorly packaged all four bulbs arrived broken. They had no bubble wrap or packing peanuts. They were loose in a box.
4,Excellent light for multiple purposes,"First of all, this lamp is usually sold in a kit that comes with a mount and ballast, so you should not be ordering this, unless it is a replacement for an existing lamp. This lamp requires a mogul fixture and will not screw into a standard light fixture. Also, this lamp requires an external ballast to function. Personally I love it and I am currently trying to assemble or purchase individual ballasts so that I can use the a little more freely in my garage. The light does not light up to 100% on start-up, but it only takes a few minutes to reach 100%.The only change I would like to see with this lamp is an option plug in ballast so that you could directly replace obsolete energy consuming incandescent lights.BTW: On my security lamp box, it states that it will illuminate an area 40 x 40. That's fairly accurate."
4,My soul has been put to ease yet my heart out of beat.....,"I finally found it! The best recording of Lezghinka! Full of pounding cow hide! It's so great, it knocks my heart out of tempo from time to time. Too bad there's no much Gayanah on this CD. You will enjoy this well done music from a not well known orchestra though. The Ippolitov-Ivanov is very soothing. Until that is you get to the conclusion with an almost patriotic sense (if villagers can have some). This CD has all kinds of moods. Happiness, sadness, anger, love, rage, sleepyness, clowny, and other moods depending on who you are. Yes buy it. It's good! Not perfect but good."
4,Essential tool for understanding the foreclosure process!!!,"If you are interested in learning about the foreclosure process, this book is a great resource! It provides you with not only with solid information on how the process works but also with invaluable insight on how to use that process to your advantage!!!"
1,Worse book I have ever bought,"This book has no content - about 15 pages worth of data you could easily get off the Internet for free! I thought this book might provide knowledge that is not easy to obtain, but the book has no content at all. The book has a whole bunch of contact info for the state of New Jersey, but that info is easily accessible from the Internet. Do not waste your money!!!!"
3,Speakers,"Product was not packed very well. Inside box was damaged. But what got me was in the bottom of the inside box were two old cigaret butts!This is definitely a poor vender.However, speakers are good, so no complaints with NXG."
5,"Great product, perfect timing","We have an Initial 7"" portable DVD player which we have misplaced the battery charger to. A year ago, I couldn't find a replacement in a pinch for a flight back home, so I made do with books and toys for my toddler. For Thanksgiving, I found this universal battery JUST in time for our family's flight back home. Kids were completely silent the whole trip. Perfect for a 2 1/2 hour flight, not sure about anything longer than that. Instructions were easy, not too many parts, but you do have to make sure you have all parts - KEEP IN SAFE PLACE. :)"
4,A good backup battery,"This battery comes in handy if you like watching movies on a portable dvd player.I Don't get a chance to watch a lot of movies at home, so I watch them on my portable dvd player away from home with my external portable battery.The battery was purchase from Amazon.Thank you Amazon.com"

4,Nice workout!,I thought this was a nice workout. Karina and Katrina are alot of fun and make the workout entertaining. I did find the workout a little on the easy side so if you are intermediate to advance level in fitness this might a little easy. But over all nice workout and nice for those days you want to take it down a notch.
1,was good until bugs crashed it...,"i am 16 hours into this game, and was very close to finishing. i enjoyed it a lot up to this point. but i cannot recommend this game to anyone, and i can only hope to steer clear any that try and buy this. after completing the slaughterhouse i went back to iris hq. funny thing is i was able to walk through double hh, which i thought was odd because he was usually in the way. well that's the last i saw of him. he never appeared again so i can't finish the game. WHAT A BUNCH OF FU@KING BULL$#IT. now i'm glad this game didn't sell well because what a crock of sh#t."
4,Cute interactive book,"I got this for my son for his upcoming first birthday, and my 3 yr old daughter loves it! It is very eye-catching with bright colors and bold illustrations. It is a cloth book with a different cut-out shape through each page (triangle, circle, square). It has a 3-D stuffed fabric caterpillar attached by its tail on the cover, and as you read the story, you maneuver the caterpillar thru the shaped holes. At the end, on the back cover, is a crinkly attached fabric butterfly showing how the caterpillar changes. Above the butterfly's wings is a slit for you to put the caterpillar's face thru (although this one is somewhat difficult even for an adult's fingers to manage---my daughter doesn't seem to mind, she still loves it!)The other pages are easier to manage, and she is able to do these. If you are familiar with Lamaze books, you know how wonderful they are. My son is drawn to them more so than any other brand. They are high quality and durable. Recommended!"
2,This is not a pretty picture book,"Again, I was expecting a picture book with colorful illustrations. Not so! I should have been more careful before I bought this. It's not for really young children who like to see pretty illustrations with the story."
1,review of CD,"If you are expecting to hear another recording and interpretation by another amateur aritst published by another unheard of record label, then you will recieve preciesly what you expected.The recording and intepretations provide another 'intepretation' by another rather unestablished 'concert pianist', lacking the profound musical understanding, performance and interpretation only attaintable by the greats.It is better to trust reputed record labels when buying recordings of these works"
3,"Deborah Gray's Wish on a Spell, Vo. 1 by Deborah Gray","This arrived quickly even though it was ordered during the busy holiday season. I was marginally disappointed overall, however. While the content was well presented, I had hoped the subject matter would have been a bit more advanced. I would recommend this to anyone new to the Craft. The visuals are lovely."
2,REALLY TINY -- LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FOR CHILDREN,"I ordered these for my wife for last Valentine's Day. I was VERY disappointed. Very tiny, cheap looking. Looked like they were for a small child. I gave a 2-star rating, but I felt that was too high."
5,More about Amazon than jewelry,"This is more about Amazon than the earings. My wife loves them, and I think she looks great in them, so we're very happy. She has a box full of jewelry that I bought her that she never wears, that's where Amazon comes in. First I bought a diamond bracelet, but Duh, she can't really wear it all the time. Amazon took it back and issued a refund three days later. Then we researched clarity, color online and customer reviews.I'm a grumpy old man, and I don't tolerate poor customer service. I've fired a lot of online services but I alway come back to Amazon. I think you have to be cautious with outside vendors offered through Amazon, but you can alway check the ratings, and even better you can call (I did that with an unbelievable $100 wool suit). Hence the rare 5 stars."
1,Did not work at all out of the box - HUGE dissapointment,"Plain and simple, this item SIMPLY DID NOT WORK OUT from the minute it came out of the box. We opened it, installed the batteries and followed the instructions. We inserted a slide, chose ""Quiz"" and tried to enter the slide's code with the letter keys. Every time we hit the letter keys to enter the slide's code it just repeats the instructions ""Please enter a slide's code to begin"". We tried to reinstall the batteries, and we even tried to use the reset button on the bottom. That did nothing. The instruction manual says to reset the toy, just remove and reinsert the batteries. There is no mention of how to use the reset button nor any description of what it should do. Very frustrating, especially since this gift was from ""Santa""! Now I have to return it and find a way to explain that to my child. Shame on this educational toy company for selling such a sub-par item that SIMPLY DID NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX. Booooooo!"
2,Interest won't last with only 12 slides,"This toy was great for the first couple of days. The facts about the different bugs are interesting and educational, and my son really enjoyed playing with it. It is well made and should last a long time. Unfortunately, it only comes with 12 slides and you cannot purchase any others. After the first couple of days my son had memorized most of the facts the microscope talks about and started losing interest. If GeoSafari would have thought through the design of this product and made it so you could purchase additional slide, they would have additional revenue coming from me for a few years to come."
2,Wish I'd Known....,"The slides are photos.The slides are limited in number to what you get with the microscope, so once you've memorized them, the ""educational value"" becomes limited.The stage of the microscope is on such an angle as to make it difficult to place ""found objects"" on it to view under magnification.Really, is this the best we can come up with for the 5 to 7-year-old crowd interested in science?"
2,Greatly disappointed,"I purchased this toy for my son and when we first opened it up, he was very excited after looking at the slides on the microscope. However he was highly anticipating learning facts about the bugs on the slides and when I put the batteries in for him, that feature did not work. We entered the codes just as the directions stated and it never not once told us a fact about any of the 12 slides included. I am very upset, my son is upset and I regret buying this product. I will write to the company and ask for a replacement or that I get a full refund."
1,Seems like a good idea,"This is a great idea and my 3-yr-old was really excited to work with it, but the buttons didn't work and wouldn't let me enter the code for the slides. The slides are pictures of bugs and aren't really magnified. I'm waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the faulty buttons. I'm probably just going to return it. Wish it could have worked!"
1,poor zoom,"This toy does not meet my expectations.It's a good brand, but in this microscope the zoom don't increace the image. :-("
2,Tricky to use and doesn't magnify,"My 5 year old and I were both very frustrated with this microscope when we first received this gift from his Grandma. The microscope wouldn't recognize the codes we were entering. It turns out that we weren't pushing the slide down far enough (they snaps in on the right side and then sits in the microscope a little crooked). It feels like the slide isn't in right but this is the only way the codes will work for us. That said, it's difficult for him to get the slide in just right and when he plays with it by himself he puts the slide in backwards so the code doesn't work. As other reviewers have noted the slides are only of bugs, you can't purchase other slides, and you can't magnify anything (and isn't that the cool part of a microscope?). A little disappointing."
4,"Great fun, but LOUD","I got this microscope for my children (ages 6, 4 and 2) for Christmas, and they fought over using it. Once I emphasized the importance of caring for the slides, the 6 year old took over that duty. I'm delighted by their interest, and hope it sparks desire to learn more science. I plan to get them a more sophisticated microscope in a few years. My big girl has already looked at her own hair and a few other tiny things that are not on slides. My only quibble is that the talking voice is VERY LOUD with no volume control, and I wouldn't want them hanging over it for too long at a time."
4,Pretty good!,"This was a gift for my 4-year-old. Bugs are inherently interesting to boys, of course! And this toy will reinforce his letter identification skills. (It requires that a letter code be punched in before a bug is identified.) The only bad thing so far is that it is hard for him to put on the slide box lid by himself."
2,Not really worth $30,"I thought this was an actual microscope. I also thought it would have a lot of cool slides with lots of interesting microscopic things to peer at. It's just a kids toy. And a very juvenile one at that. All that is included is bugs, and they are not really magnified. It's just a picture of a mosquito or a beetle on a white screen. Do you remember the old red ""View Finders"" from the 80's? This is a much more base-level version of that - only not nearly as much variety and not nearly as cool. My kid liked it, but I am sorry I spent $30 on it."
4,Fun and Easy learning time,"This is a fun and easy to use, easy to learn from educational toy. We love being able to see the little bugs get bigger under the microscope. My children were able to play the game with me supervising, but children under 5 will need help to operate the game, but children under 5 can easily put the slides under the microscope to view them.To see my full review check out: [...]Coming from Mom's Thumb Reviews"
5,"Amazing music, great performance and recording","Based on the above review, I purchased this cd, and it is already one of my favorites. The Brahms quintet is one of my favorite works, although the second piano concerto still ranks at the top. However, the Schumann quintet is my favorite work by this composer. The pairing is very nice, and you can definitely hear the influence of Schumann (although which Schumann...Clare or Robert may be up for debate). I can't recommend this cd with any higher enthusiasm"
2,Brief descriptions with poor explainations,"The book is okay if you don't want to learn the entire physical examination. The pictures do always go with the explainations and the chapters are entirely too short to give an accurate description of the test performed. The nutrition chapter is a joke, and sequence of chapters is terrible."
3,A Disappointment,"This CD should be wonderful, after all, Leroy Anderson was a fine composer and arranger, and three of the pieces on the CD have been unavailable for decades. However, it's a disappointment. The three Suites of Carols are for orchestra sections (brass, strings, or woodwinds) and are undistinguished. The recorded sound is mostly thin and harsh. Even though the CD includes two recordings of ""Sleigh Ride"", the total time is only 50 minutes. Even at the bargain price, I can recommend this CD only to the most fervent Leroy Anderson fans."
5,The Pacific,Purchased this for my husband at Christmas. He was thrilled to get it. We've been watching it together and enjoying it tremendously. It would certainly be a good film for the younger generations to watch so they can understand the sacrifices made to give them the freedoms they have today. Wonderful series.
4,Pacific,My only complaint with this order was the time it took to get to me after I ordered it. I did return it because someone gave it to me as a present for Christmas.
4,The Pacific,"The question that everyone asked, myself included, is this as good as Band of Brothers? In a word, no, but that does not mean it is not a good show. It doesn't have the character developmnet of Band of Brothers,we don't get to know them as well, I found myself wondering who was who several times while watching. The story line was little off pace,it wanderd a bit, it just seemed like it was maybe a rushed project. But-- a story worth telling and definately worth watching. Every American should know what our boys went through for our sake, something we can't even imagine today --God bless 'em all! 4 out of 5 stars."
4,The Pacific,"If you view this series expecting another Band of Brothers, don't. I thought it dwelled a little to much on the background and personal, off-duty side of things. I would have preferred more from the military view point. All in all, not bad."
3,The Pacific DVD set.,"Well, we loved it up until the 3rd CD, straight out of the box was damaged. NO problem, customer service was excellent and it's gone back and they are replacing it."
4,WOAH,"This HBO series was pretty intense and gruesome as to looking at the other part of the war. (A.K.A on the Pacific side) It really opens your eyes. However I also own the HBO series ""Band of Brothers"" and I find that Band of Brothers is better than the Pacific, but in all they are good and educational to watch."
2,"Historically Correct, Utterly Forgettable","I couldn't even finish watching it. The acting and directing is dismal, the characters dull and uninteresting. I did not feel like I was there, in the South Pacific in 1942. You could make an animated movie with those stick figures speaking in monotone computer voices and it wouldn't be any worse. Not even in the same league, not even in the same universe as Band of Brothers. Big disappointment!"
5,Amazing.,"Former Marine here. This struck such a deep cord with me that I could not watch the whole first episode as it was just so true to the Corps. In other words, so well done that it made this former grunt burst out in tears. Absolutely amazing production. You want to really learn something about the U.S.M.C.? Watch this."
2,The Pacific is NOT family-friendly,"I purchased this series hoping that they would be like Band of Brothers. In their graphic depiction of the horrors of war, they match up well against that earlier series. I suspected that, like Band of Brothers, there would be some profanity and obscenity and probably a sex scene. But I believed that the overriding benefit would outweigh those factors. To those who are thinking along those same lines - be forewarned. The Pacific includes literally hundreds of uses of the F-word and S-word, at times peppering the dialogue in every single sentence, especially during the fighting scenes. There are also at least three graphic sex scenes, two with extensive breast nudity and movements, and references to pornography and masturbation. Whether these will dissuade you from watching this series is up to you, but I want to ensure that you are aware of this before you set your family in front of the television."
4,Another Great WWII Series,"A great series! Not quite as good as band of brothers, but still intriguing and educational. Definitely for adults only."
4,The Pacific Blu-ray,"The Pacific blu-ray is great. Item was shipped over to me very quickly, and was at a conciderable savings verses all other majior in-store prices I checked out. This is just an awesome series for anyone who is into the WWII genre. Would highly recommend this miniseries to everyone."
2,Very disappointing,"After seeing Band of Brothers, I was very interested in seeing the other side of the war. Band of Brothers is a masterpiece. I understand how difficult it is to try and document a war fought on so many fronts (islands) for the Pacific theater. That being said, it was too disjointed and had too many subplots to follow it accurately. I also found the gratuitous sex scenes unnecessary and even unrealistic for that period of time. Of course premarital sex was a reality but popping into bed twenty minutes after meeting someone in 1943 would be more appropriate for 2013. I'm thinking the writers parents were my generation and did not grasp the moral leanings of their grandparents generation. The carnage was true and accurate as well and who would doubt that this was the norm and not the exception. But, jeez, did we need to have so much of it to get the pont across?!"
2,the pacific,2 discs were pretty scratched up and couldn't watch them but I have not watched all of them yet and will try to do so next week.
2,Waste of time,"Don't spend money on this cheesy film. If you are looking for a Band of Brothers type show, this isn't it. It's predictable and poorly acted. Waste of money."
4,"Good, but a bit too much gore","We loved Band of Brothers, so we went ahead and got a copy of The Pacific, expecting something along those lines. It was made close to ten years later when the HBO viewing public expects more gore, more cussing, and more sex. A lot of it was unnecessary, especially the unnatural amount of blood and guts (literally) toward the last few episodes. All that being said, it was very entertaining and told a story not often heard... but more in a drama setting and less of a docudrama."
4,The Pacific,"What's to say - Good Flick.Have to get, as of now - seven more words here.So - would I purchase it again - if I hadn't alreadyseen it - and own it - I suppose I would."
3,The Pacific rating,It was good but not the quality of Band of Brothers. Spent a lot of time on life at home and not as much on the Pacific Theater.Close but no cigar.
1,Beyond disappointing,"Having read all the books that were used in this series, I looked forward to it greatly. I am more than dismayed by actually seeing the production. It is disjointed and incoherent with a paucity of character development. One star is all this deserves. After looking closely at the authors and directors of each episode, I noted that they are all different persons. I suspect that the disjointed series is due to uncoordinated authorship put to film by different directors. The outcome is mediocre at best (and not worth watching more than once)."
5,Stirring and Respectful,"I thought this film was very stirring and respectful of the great sacrifices made by Marines. I read Sledge's book ""With the Old Breed,"" so I was excited to see a movie about his experiencens during and after the war. The acting was great, some bright young stars with promising futures. I also appreciated the commentary from the Vets. Every American should watch this movie."
5,Wonderful,"This series, originally on HBO is a keeper. It is much like ""Band of Brothers"" as to quality of content but obviously about the Pacific. If you didn't see it on HBO I definatley reco. getting the dvd set, it will hold your attention. Well done!!"
2,The Pacific,"I did not like this item. Somehow I thought it would depict all the U.S. service in the pacific, not just the marines and some navy. Also, I expected historical footage, not a hollywood movie. Was disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"Sorry I wasted my time watching this......very disappointing. Acting was horrible, Direction was horrible. Hanks is a jerk!"
2,Can one take Tom Hanks narrating seriously?,"I am strained to believe that Tom Hanks would ever step out of his cubicle and engage in an act of bravery when he runs such deceitful propaganda for the current oval office holder. I have two family members who fought in the Pacific and might have come back, but never made it really back. He hasn't the right to speak of military history in the Pacific written by others that was acted out with real flesh and blood by brave men. That he could support suck ilk that is gutting the Marine Corps now just because his agent says it's good publicity and Speilberg loves him is an affront to brave men indeed. They should chose believable narrators. Hillary Clinton could have done this series and been similarly received as an interloper...ACK!"
2,"Disappointing, at best.","Yes, I was expecting Band of Brothers II - The Pacific. But even without setting the bar that high, I was greatly dissapointed in the series.There was a lack of cohesion between episodes, the characters were all over the place, you weren't sure who to follow, or who to like, and the writing was poor. Cliche-City.To me, the most disappointing part of the whole thing was that I felt I lacked the sense of what really happened over there. In Band of Brothers, you saw D-Day to the fall of Berlin, step by bloody step. In Pacific, there were disjointed battle scenes, between all the scenes of R&R; in Australia, psych-ward stays, military hospitals, etc. Just a big, weird jumble.About the only character I felt was up to par with the group from Band of Brothers was Sledgehammer.Disappointing."
1,Paints a negative picture or our Marines,"Unlike the Band of Brothers series, this series paints a very negative picture of the war and our Marines that fought for us. Virtually every episode focuses on a Marine doing some either stupid or dishonorable."
3,It's no band of brothers,"It's clear that war is a brutal and horrible thing. I am just not sure that it's a good use of my entertainment time to watch soldier after soldier stare off into the distance and see how he's clearly dehumanized as a result of war, emotionally scarred and likely to do something reflective as such on screen.Not to mention that the pacing is really strange (Melbourne ep, Lecky recuperating etc...), I actually found myself fast forwarding (PVR) on multiple occasions to get to something interesting.I loved Band of Brothers but this is a shadow of that effort."
1,Never received order RIPOFF,"THANKS FOR NOTHING. REALLY MADE A NICE VALENTINES PRESENT FOR MY HUSBAND WHO REALLY WANTED THIS AND HAS AN ABDOMIAL AORTIC ANURESYM AND THREE BLOCKAGES IN HIS HEART, ORDER THIS IN JANUARY TO BE SURE AND HAVE IT BY VALENTINES DAY. THANKS FOR NOTHING AND I HOPE EVERYONE WILL QUIT USING AMAZON."
3,good,"Good but not nearly as good as band of brothers; i know that's not exactly fair, but i just thought band of brothers was much stronger, a better drama. The look and feel of the show though is excellent.As far as the delivery of the product though, the experience was excellent - delivered quickly, in stated condition. One minor gripe is that one of the disc holding hub things is cracked and doesn't hold its DVD well, but it's not a big deal."
2,"Not nearly as good as ""Band of Brothers","Seems like someone said ""let's see if we can squeak even more revenue out of the Band of Brothers success"". The acting fell far short of the original, although the filming was decent. The story line was disjunct and you never quite got to know any of the characters. I'm not a prude but I didn't appreciate the unnecessary nudity (somewhat of an HBO trademark I guess). Finally, as a music lover, the score just never hit home for me. I'll probably donate this to the library. I won't want to watch it repeatedly as I do with Band of Brothers."
2,Starting really slow,"OK, maybe I need to wait until I've watched the whole thing, but I've gotten through the first three discs and this is sloooooooow!Well, I made it through the whole set of discs and have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. The pace of the story did pick up and the Marine Corps never looked better. But, I think they could have done a better job. Doesn't compare to Band of Brothers, and I'm a former Marine!"
2,A sad and pathetic attempt.,"I couldn't wait for this series to come out being a huge fan of band of brothers, unfortunately in the end it was rather disappointing. In band of brother you got to learn about the characters and you started to feel as if you knew them personally but with the pacific you have a random group if guys you doing ever really connect with. The series was 95% dialog, 1% sex, and 4% battle wich in my opinion made it rather slow and uninteresting. All in all it, to me, was a disappointment and nothing I would ever buy."
4,The Horrors of War,"The horrors of war vs. entertainment. That's pretty much what a lot of people are trying to do when I see all the comments about Band of Brothers. Two seperate series and it's a mistake to look for BoB in the Pacific. This series was about the horror of war and the marines that had to live through it, plain and simple. It was violent and gruesome but it was honest.Not that I'm knocking BoB as that was a true story but the Pacfic lacks the comradery that BoB shared and for entertainment purposes that's a big thing to be missing in a war series.The special effects, costumes, performances...all first rate. Anyone that is gun ho for war and combat because they play too many video games should watch this first before they rush off to fight in a real shooting war. War is hell and this series shows you just how much it is."
5,The Pacific on Blu Ray,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He really loved the Band of Brother's series and wanted The Pacific to go with it. I got it at a GREAT deal and I'm extremely happy with my purchase! I'd do it all again...
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"After having enjoyed Band of Brothers, I was looking forward to gifting my 16 year old son, a history buff, with this sequel series. We watched the first 2 episodes and, thankfully, I checked the rest of the series ahead of my son. This material should be X-rated for the prolonged and graphic scenes of sex and the extreme and unnecessary gore. What happened to the film producers??? This is perverse and polluting. Nothing in common with the appropriate reality (even harsh) of Band of Brothers. I only wish I had thought of checking IMDb before removing the clear plastic cover of the metal box, so I could get my money back."
5,The Pacific,"If you like American history (or history in general), this is a good series. It is about the PTO, and shows the battles of Guadalcanal, Peleliu, and Okinawa. Different to ""Band of brothers"" as The Pacific does not focus on one particular company."
5,Shows a different side to war.,"The Pacific is definately not Band Of Brothers. Nor was is made out to be. Band Of Brothers was about how war created a brotherhood between ""Easy Company"". The Pacific on the other hand shows an accurate protrayal of the brutalities of war, both physically and mentally. The Pacific shows what was going on on the western front during WWII, when most of the American eyes were concentrated on the War in Europe. This series shows what our Marines went through physically and still are going through mentally in the War against Japan. IF you're looking for a mushy war movie that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, this isn't your cup of tea. This is the realities of war."
5,one of the best,"if you are old enought to appriciate, ww2 movies, this is the one for you. enclosed in a tin, you will treasure it like no other."
1,Never received,"I bought it on Amazon.com by oct 2010 and today is dec 25 and i didnt receive my stuff, so i can not rate this."
1,Disappointing Mini Series,"I cancelled HBO after their cancelling of Deadwood without a decent ending, but I looked forward to the Pacific and watched it at my daughters.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! What was HBO thinking? I know this isn't Band of Brothers, but with the same people in charge you would expect somethingcomparable. Not even close. This is pure rubbish with graphic sex scenes that add no value to the series. The series protrays the marines in a veryvery negative manner and it is an insult to those who fought and died in the Pacific campaigns. The acting isn't good so it is hard to connect to thecharacters, plus it jumps around to much. I purchased Band of Brothers to watch whenever I want to, but this mess is something I won't buy or watch ever again."
2,NOT THAT HOT!,"I know Tom Hanks worked on this, and that Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece, but this was just not that good. I know that there are time constraints when it comes to film making, but the way they glossed overthe battle for Guadalcanal was disservice not only to all who fought there, but also to the true telling of the story. The US Marines started the battle on August 7th 1942, and the Japanese didn't finally leave untilFebruary 7th of 1943. To watch the battle in the HBO special, you might think it was over in few days and not all that bad. And Tarawa was even worse. The Pacific Theater was a horrible dirty war. If we want to try to never have war again, maybe our ""specials"" on WWII should be more accurate. They should show just how bad it really was."
1,"Horrible Writing, not nearly as good as Band of Brothers","Really disappointing. Nothing like Band of Brothers. Great production value, but just no story, bad writing, and characters I didn't care about. Really didn't even want to finish watching it. Sold mine back on Amazon"
4,Superb Complement to Band of Brothers,"If you have already enjoyed ""Band of Brothers"" which was focused on the European theater around the time of D-Day through VE Day, then you will surely like this story of the other side of the world during WWII.The environments and conditions could hardly be more different. The enemy and the terrain was a just as brutal but so dissimilar. In this series, you get to see the conclusion of the largest war ever fought, told from an insider's perspective.This is a must-see documentary."
4,The Pacific,"The movie I found to be moving and fast paced. As a former Marine I felt compeled to relate to the individuals in the film. As a matter of fact many on these Marines portryed were much like those men I served with and lead as a Marine Squad Leader and Platoon Sgt. It reflected the concept that the Corps is a calling. I was told once by an old warhorse GySgt, ""the Marine Corps is the only branch of service where you become. In other words, all the other services you join but you become Marine"".During my years of service I have discovered that Marines are truly a breed unto themselves and there is no way others can see and understand them for who they are. But this pressentation came a long way to reflect the Corps and the caliber of those men and women who servicedIn closing,those who put this film together really did their homework. It was like being home again. Sempra Fi!"
5,The Pacific is EXCELLENT!,"The Pacific is an EXCELLENT mini-series! It is not entirely historically accurate, but still very, very good! My husband and I both loved it and watched it as quickly as we could!"
5,Life changing.,"Another great series from HBO on the events of WWII. If you haven't watched this, order it right now you will not be disappointed. This series will make you lie in bed and really think about your life and realize what a nation we really are. 10 out of 10."
5,Must see WWII Pacific Theatre film!,"The Pacific (HBO Miniseries) [Blu-ray] is a MUST see for any WWII movie fan or history buff. I first watched ""Band of Brothers,"" also an HBO Miniseries, and just naturally progressed to this series. They are both incredible productions! Too graphic for children but really tells it like it was.The Pacific (HBO Miniseries) [Blu-ray] or the DVD would be a little cheaper but I thought the Blu-ray was worth it.The Pacific (HBO Miniseries)A true tip of the hat to HBO for this great miniseries! Thank you!"
5,The Pacific,"Great mini-series bringing a little different and in depth view of what it was like for the US soldiers in the Pacific during WWII. This isn't an up beat series....somber, sad, and real!"
4,Must-Have for WWII buffs,"If you own the vintage DVD edition of Band of Brothers, this is a must-have complement featuring the brutality and extraordinary personal sacrifice of our troops in the Pacific theater during WWII. Some extremely intense and gory scenes, but highly realistic and combined with impressive depth of character development. I have already watched the entire 6 CD set twice through, and there are some unforgettable episodes and scenes in every one."
3,Not Band of Brothers,"After watching Band of Brothers with my husband several times, I decided to get The Pacific for him for Christmas. This is not Band of Brothers. Very little time spent developing characters so we get to know them and can recognize them under all the mud and blood later on. Too much gore! Maybe the PTO was just bloodier than the ETO but - way too much reality. Maybe it's a guy thing. It took a few episodes before we figured out how to get to the historical perspectives and interviews with actual survivors. That does make it better to hear about the action in the words of those who were there."
5,Not your Band of Brothers..,"I had not seen any episodes on HBO, and went ahead with my BluRay purchase knowing that anyting Speilberg and Hanks put together was worth having. This is one of the very best films I have seen on the ""real life story"" of our Marine Corps and the horrors of the conflict in the Pacific. Not for the young at heart but I do hope many of our Generation Y will watch and undestand what sacrifices were made to make this county what it is today. War is not a video game ..... this is the price paid for our freedoms so litely taken for granted!"
5,Speedy Gonzales,Awesome!!!My Father Will Be Happy...My Grandfather Would Be Happy Also If He Were Here...So In The Mean Time...Visit killloverbleed.ch ; )
2,Not Band of Brothers,Formulaic and full of cliches.... this is not band of brothers. It's saving grace is that it accurately outlines the timing of important battles in the pacific during the war and makes it feel more intimately tied to the people in combat rather than the generals pushing markers around a hexagonal grid.
5,Great,"My favorite subject is WW2 and i think that Tom hanks did a great job again, i Loved band of Brothers and I love the Pacific it showed a great story of the Marines during WW2"
3,"Great show, not what I ordered though...","When I ordered this collection I was expecting to receive the metal cased edition, since I have the metal box cased edition for Band of Brothers. I received instead the cardboard boxed set. I was disappointed, but because it was such a great price, I didn't bother about it. All of the pictures showing the product I was receiving indicated to me that I was going to receive the metal box. Oh well I suppose. Besides that, it shipped quickly and arrived in great shape. The Series is also absolutely fantastic (totally on par with Band of Brothers). Defiantly NOT for children, EVEN with guidance, but great for history buff's like myself who enjoy detailed storytelling and dramatized facts of what REALLY happened. The show gets 5 stars. This order gets 3 because of not getting what I thought I was going to get. It would be nice to let the buyer know if it was the cardboard box set or the metal boxed edition... just saying."
3,"Seen better, Seen worse","After falling in love with ""Band of Brothers"", I had to purchase ""The Pacific"" to go with it. I was disappointed in the movie. Perhaps if I had watched it before ""B.O.B."" it would have been better. There was so much hype that my expectations were high. Unfortunately, it's only been viewed twice, yet we still watch Band Of Brothers. : ("
3,"""the pacific"" book vs video","While I enjoyed the video series ""the pacific"", it had good military action based on the marines 1st division,it did not include much from the book it was taken from. As usual the book was much better, but that is usually the case."
3,soap opera,"The emphasis on the soap opera detracted from the full story of the Pacific campaign of WW II. I expected to be educated, not titillated ( I already knew that men on the eve of battle and the women they are with have a lot of sex, but some of it was beyond unbelievable. The lovely daughter of Greek immigrants sneaks into his room in her parents' house? give me a break.) It would have benefitted from more about what was happening (and why) in the bigger picture. Production values were outstanding, however."
3,Something lacking...,"I never felt close to these characters the way I felt with the men from Band of Brothers. Somehow that earlier series was done better... Can't really figure out why, but The Pacific lacked something..."
3,I wish I could have ranked this higher,"Band of Brothers was better. The people who made this series worked very hard I'm sure. I compliment them for that. However, if you do not have familiarity with the WWII Pacific war, you will find this hard to follow. Band of Brother followed one unit for a shorter duration of the war. The Pacific has to cover a longer time frame with three different soldiers. A big piece of history to bite off. Band of Brothers also focused on the combat unit not the home front. The home front aspect of this series I found wandering and drawn out too much. I wish I could rate this higher but I cannot."
3,"Not as good as ""Band of Brothers""","While I enjoyed ""The Pacific"", I compared it to ""Band of Brothers"" which I found superior. The pacific war is not as well known as the european war. Fighting in the pacific was brutal - Japanese marines and US marines fought til everyone was dead. I thought the characterization was weak - it was hard to identify the personalities and get any feeling for their personal situation. It was also hard to place the events - Guadalcanal, Pelieu - in the bigger picture."
5,excellent,Like most people I was very excited to hear that HBO was making another series I do agree Band Of Brothers was much better I still think The Pacific is also very good. I have family who fought in this war and to this day they will not talk about what happened in Guadalcanal. The great thing about both series is it gives us an up close and personal look at the war and the brave ones who fought in it and when I think about it how can we say one show was better then the other when this is based on actual events so I change my review by saying both Band of brothers and The Pacific are amazing.
4,"Pleased, It's not Band of Brothers","Overall I was pleased with the series. Like many other reviews I too was disappointed only because I was expecting something more along the lines of BoB. With that aside, The Pacific was a very good series. It tells of the hard times the Marines had, the suffering they went through, the sleepless nights for fear of the Japs might sneak into camp and cut your throat. If you are expecting another Band of Brothers, it isn't here. If you want to watch a good series about the War in the Pacific, this is it."
2,Warning... Basically SOFT PORN & TOO MUCH SOAP-OPERA DRAMA with good war scenes,"Just FYI... I loved BAND OF BROTHERS. Just about my favorite war series ever. However, ""The Pacific"" starts off well-intended, but soon turns into a soap-opera & semi-porn drama. Can't believe this had the same directors and production crew.Great acting, but dives way too far into the personal lives of the soldiers. There is nudity and a lot of needless sex. Even if you're okay with that, it's simply distracting and out of place.When it came on I DVR'd and invited my dad over (thinking it was another ""Band of Brothers""-style movie. Very uncomfortable to watch, especially with a bunch of other ""dudes"" around. You better keep this far away from the kids too, of course.Sorry, gets a 2 star from me. Very sadly disappointed. I need more of the inspirational Band of Brothers type of productions."
5,great service,I received this product very quickly after my order was placed. I will order from this site again. Thank you
5,Unconditional surrender...resounding defeat of militant Japan...!,"I have decided to buy this mini TV series for showing to my family and friends because some of us have experienced the horror and barbarism of the Imperial ""Bungsai"" Jap armies when they invaded my country of birth, then British Malaya in 1943. These savages inflicted harm, rape, plunder and massacre throughout South East Asia, until the two Jap cities - Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuked at the expressed order of President Harry S. Truman thus these brutes sued for unconditional surrender. There were then loud cheers throughout the land of South East Asia when finally these brutes laid down their arms and bowed to the landing couquerors...the British troops to which their fellow POWs were traumatized and tortured by the japs...Cheers!"
1,Written by 12 year olds,No focus of story and dialog that sounds like it was written by a 12 year old kid playing with his plastic army men. Hanks and Spielberg should publicly apologize for creating this load of crap.
1,Disappointing. At best.,"I knew before I sat down to watch this that I wouldn't like it as much as Band of Brothers. I'm a former paratrooper, not a former Marine. But I still thought I would at least enjoy it on some level. After 4 episodes I realized that I really don't care at all for this miniseries. I didn't care for the plot. I didn't care for the relationships being built (or not built) between the characters. I didn't even care for the characters. I'm sure my love for Band of Brothers set my expectations pretty high for The Pacific but I didn't realize that I'd be so disappointed that I wouldn't bother watching any episodes after the fourth one. I'm so glad I rented this before buying."
2,Liberal Spielberg and Hanks,I was disgusted with the leftist bent in this series. Hanks and Spielbergallowed GI attrocities but never showed the much greater attrocities madeby the Japanese. Their leftist bent dishonored the GIs who faught thePacific war.
1,THEY BLEW IT !,I was hoping it was going to be as great or even better (if that is possible) like Band of Brothers.It had the makings of being a great film but they BLEW IT!It was so slow and boring I was hoping it would kick in at some point and when it never did it was a big let down!With Band of Brothers I bought the DVD and have watched it over and over and over.With The Pacific the thought of buying the DVD never entered my mind. It was that bad
4,The Price of our freedom,"I have seen the first 2 episodes of The Pacific and am truly in awe of the production. It is so well done, so authentic and, quite frankly, a bit scary. Scary to think what these people went through - this was the price that was paid for our freedom as Americans. Besides being informative and educational, this mini series inspires a great sense of pride in being American and a great appreciation for what we have in the 21st century. I would recommend it without hesitation, however, it is not, in my opinion, suitable for children under the age of 18."
2,Too explict on the sex scenes ... unnecessary.,Too much sex when telling an important story. How can you sit and watch this with family or friends without feeling uncomfortable. Hollywood mucks it up again.
2,pacific,"The history was not great like band of brothersWas contentdull and some parts very strong content, band brothers 10 times betters"
1,DVD's scratched and marred.,"I received the DVD's, opened them carefully. Dvd's # 2 and 3 have large defects on the playing service. I tried to clean them but they were either large scuff marks on some other unremoveable material. The residue of marks caused the DVD so stop, skip and stutter."
1,Male Porno,"This movie was not even close to the same caliber as Band of Brothers. It is poorly written, boring, hard to keep track of what's going on. There is no lack of male nudity which definitely takes away from the movie. To be fair, I stopped watching the series half way through on account of not wanting to see any more full frontal nude body shots of men. Tom Hanks, is there something you want to share with us?"
1,Not worth it!,Was expecting something similar to Band of Brothers and was VERY disappointed! Could not understand half of what was said and the scenes at night were impossible to see....even on my 60 inch tv.....
3,This is no Band of Brothers,"I do not get or want to pay extra bucks to get HBO where I live in Montreal. But I did see part of one episode (can't even tell you which one) while vacationning in Cuba of all places...yes Varadero Cuba and get this they also had CNN! Anyway...I had high expectations and like many of you was hoping for this series to be a second BOB, well BOB it is not. Perhaps we got attached to the men of Easy Company so much that our expectations were too high but I found that the actors in Pacific were just that, actors. In BOB they were soldiers. I did not see the sex scene and can not ""appreciate"" it's pertinence but it is part of life and sometimes part of a soldier's experience (yes even in WWII). What I find odd is that it seems perfectly acceptable to some to show graphic violence and totaly revolting to show graphic sex. People often die from violence, rarely from sex."
4,The Pacific,This mini-series was the perfect solution to yesterday's snow day. I went into the viewing expecting Band of Brothers- Pacific edition. This was not really the case. The Pacific is far more character driven than B of B. I was a little disappointed by the introduction of interesting characters that then disappear to bring in new ones. I enjoyed this mini-series immensely; just wish there had been more consistency with pacing and character development.
3,Don't expect a Band of Brothers Part II,Just finished watching this series. Its good but for sure not as good as Band of Brothers. A few very poor episodes combined with a few good ones are not making this mini series a must have/see. I expected better from Hanks and Spielberg.
3,Not what I expected,"With all the tension and drama within this movie, I was most inspired to know that a U.S. Marine can get laid anywhere in the world. Of particular note was the blonde pounding a headboard against a wall while the marine is driving home the object. Never saw this nonsense in Band or Savings Ryans Privates."
4,"Very realistic,BUT...","A truly great series, my ONLY complaint is the back and forth shooting being very difficult to follow.If only there was a better way to portray such action for viewers. Also, difficult to tell who's being shot as everyone seems the same, being a 50+ viewer, it is difficult to follow such scenes. Very enjoyable otherwise and would highly recommend. Didn't even hear of Basilone before watching this series. +++"
4,review,"got it in perfect time, great shape.i returned one of them because my son-in-law already bought it. so far no hassles."
2,Shocked,Shocked & surprised at how much nudity was in this series. Not even close to being as good as Band of Brothers.I would not recommend this series.
5,The Pacific,This is an outstanding personal account of what happened in the South Pacific in WWII. It is better than Band of Brothers. I totally recommend.
5,Better than expected,Blu Ray disk came in canister with lots of extras. Very satisfied. One of my favorite movies of all time showing the rigors of the soldiers of the greatest generation.
3,This isn't a john wayne flick,"I've been blessed to miss war in my lifetime, but after watching this film you walk away praying for more peace.That young gun ho kid, can't believe Marines were like that, trigger happy?, I mean many of the scenes showed GI's using their field knife to pull out Japanese teeth like it was some medieval prize, I don't see any honor in that. I was expecting a film, like many before it, about bravery, honor, and protecting the helpless. Instead, the film makers painted a picture of monsters.The ending fit extremely well with someone who has a guilty conscious... PTSD?The only reason I gave it 3 stars is due to the fact they had a great intro."
3,Band of Brothers in the Pacific,"I do NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, mean to denigrate the Corps, and what they did during WW II. My Uncle was a Marine at Iwo, Saipan,Luzon,and island hopped all the way to Japan. (He later went to Korea) But, even he, who was a MARINE to his dying day, laughingly called himself a "" Seagoing bellhop "". This was a sideways tribute to the Navy which got them to where they had to go; often during sea battles. As a Navy Vet of Viet Nam, I thank them for saving my life. Remember Midway, Coral Sea, and the USS Indianapolis. That aside, it is as touching, heart-rending, and moving as ""Band of Brothers"" was before it"
1,Major disappointment,"I had heard that this series was comparable to the Band of Brothers. It is not even close. The battle scenes shot at night are very difficult to follow. Most of the battle scenes shot during the day resemble a mob running blindly into gun fire. Watching this made me think that the Marines of WWII were the most poorly trained soldiers on the planet who could be psychologically broken en masse and were guilty of absolutely brutal mob behavior. This was basically a Hollywood Vietnam War interpretation of the WWII Pacific theater of WWII. It was a completely inaccurate portrayal of some of the finest soldiers in the world and not entertaining at all. There was little character development, weak story telling and continuous foul language. This series is an absolute waste of time and money. I am currently trying to figure out how to get rid of it."
4,For the History Aficionado,My dad loves this time period and he loved this film. He could not stop talking about it after he watched it the first time.
5,PACIFIC,"HAVE YOU WATCHED BAND OF BROTHERS? SIMILAR TO IT , WATCH PACIFIC IT IS WORTH THE TIME IF YOU LIKE WAR MOVIES. ONCE YOU SIT ON THAT CHAIR YOU WON'T MOVE TILL IT IS FINISHED, IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO I MEAN."
2,Dull pacing and lack of quality direction ruins a great story,"The Marines who fought in WWII deserved a story similar to what the Army soldiers who fought in Europe received in Band of Brothers. Sadly, this is no where near as good a story as that. While the fighting stories are exceptional, this lacks the focus on the unit and the men that was found in BOB. By the end of that mini-series we knew who each guy was and we could feel their feelings and cared about their survival. The Pacific doesn't drive that feeling. We just see a bunch of guys who fight in WWII but the soldiers are just blanks and we are not allowed to feel a strong link to them.I would wait until History starts running it around the clock to watch it again. But this is a weak follow up to Band of Brothers."
2,Fighting Scenes-AWESOME Rest-BORING,"The scenes of the action in the pacific are awesome. Some of them I almost couldn't believe except I knew they had gone to great lengths for accuracy. What those guys went through was pure hell. I do wish they would have spent more time on the battle scenes on Guadalcanal. They seemed to fly through that part. Their defeat there was one of the biggest turning points of the war for the Japanese, and lasted much longer than shown in the movie.For the rest of the movie, I fast forwarded after 3/4 of the first DVD. Trying to watch those scenes that weren't actual fighting or showing something that caught my attention was brutal. To me they were mostly boring, with a few light comedic scenes thrown in.2/10's of this show was AWESOME! with the fighting scenes.2/10's of this show was alright with comic scenes and 1 or 2 of the telling points in the movie.6/10's of the show was absolutely boring...and I mean boring too tears."
2,an ok series,I found the problem with the pacific being that you cant really connect with the characters. They series prevents you from getting to know the characters because true to life alot of the marines died. with main characters continuously getting killed it was hard to get into.
3,Good - It was a mini-series needed!!,"This mini-series was one of the final wishes of Stephen Ambrose. His son finished the book about the war in the Pacific. Read the books by robert leckie, and Eugene Sledge before watching the series. It is not as well done as the Band of Brothers series - But it is a story which needs to be told."
1,Poor Manufacturing of DVD,"After three purchases and three exchanges of this DVD, I have given up trying to find a workable copy. In every case, the DVD locks up at the Root Menu and will not proceed to the 1st episode. Obviously, a real manufacturing failure. I hope they correct the problem and re-manufacture. I really wanted to have this!!!"
4,Entertaining,I love War movies i just wish this series had more combat scenes. I enjoy this series but in my opinion its not as good as Band of Brothers. I wish they would have focused more on conditions of the war in that theatre and gotten deeper into the dirtyness of War. Seeing a few flame thrown soldiers running about and a soldier collecting Gold teeth just wasnt Gritty enough. I want to leave a film with a sense that ive been moved or disturbed i want to feel something besides a little action. I did not get that after seeing this series. That is why i deducted 1 star.
5,GREAT!,I bought this product for a christmas gift and it works great! didnt take long to get here at all. Great job!
2,Disappointed......,"I had such high hopes for this series..especially after watching BoB. Yes...I knew it was going to be totally different then BoB...but I also expected it to hold my interest as much as BoB did. Sadly it hasn't. I think I stopped watching around episode 5 or 6. Nothing I saw in TP compared to excellent portrayal of Major Winters by Damian Lewis from BoB. I just couldn't latch on to any of the characters. For some reason none of the battle scenes were as compelling as say the Brecourt Assault depicted in BoB. TP did have some moments, ""We don't have enough men"", but just not enough to keep me watching."
1,.A Piece of Crap!,The only reason this review is a one star review is because the window wouldn't allow a no star rating. The storyline is impossible and unbeleivable. soldiers and Marines that were in the pacific tell a different story. I agree with all of the other one star ratings. I noticed in the third program that the primers were missing from cartridges for a machine gun belt that was going to be used. The cartridege heads looked like wood plugs that someone tried to pass off as bullets. Don't waist your money.
1,HBO DVD Production Stinks,"I loved this mini-series when it was broadcast. This review is of the DVD set, not the series. WHY do I need to be forced to watch a 5-minute HBO commecial (can't skip to menu, can't speed through) at the start of a DVD that I have purchased?The box set is minimal. The metal box is made of tin-foil thin metal that does less to protect the DVDs than cardboard."
3,A little bit of a let down,"I watched The Pacific first, prior to ""Band of Brothers"". I found that this series jumped around and never really established a main character or unit. It seemed more at times that each episode was almost it's own movie, occasionally one or two of the episodes were tied together. Still with it's short comings, anything done by Spielberg & Hanks is worth veiwing and diplicts the horrid scenes from the Pacific front. Along with a few episodes about Medal of Honor winner John Bisone at Guadalcanal."
4,"It's good, but a little limited..","This is not a failing of the movie, or the quality of the acting, directing, etc... its just that the Pacific theater of the war, IMHO, while much more horrific than most of the European part of WWII, just wasn't as engaging a story (guys in jungle on uninhabited islands, fighting an enemy that is hard to relate to). Band of Brothers was a bit better in this regard. This one, because of the lack of engagement, spent whole episodes following guys in more mundane stuff just to give the audience something more...character development, drama, change of scenery, etc... This was something that wasn't as necessary in the original Band of Brothers. Still very worth watching/getting though."
3,Former Marine Dissapointed it the Series,"After watching Band of Brothers a historic story of the European Campaign of Army's Easy Company I was more than excited when I heard there would be a series following the Marine Corps Island Hopping Campaign. Having served in the Marine Corps Infantry myself from 91'-98' we studied and heard the wars stories of ""Chesty Puller"" and the battles in Guadalcanal 1/1, Pelilu (sp). The series just doesn't do a great job of capturing the war at all. It jumps around quite a bit and spends too much in my opinion outside of the combat theater. I was disappointed it just followed the lives of just 3 Marines. I wanted a series I could watch over and over like I do with band of brothers. This was a one time series for me. I guess it was just too hard to follow in the ""combat"" boots of the first series.I want to love it, just couldn't.Semper Fi"
3,Outstanding visual but poor initiating.,"The visual and effects are superb like what you expect from a movie but as the series continue on you will find the explosions repetitive. Run, explosions, run explosions, etc. Each battle does not tell you location or name of the battle. The director just want to glorify the war and put every battle as victories. So basically your watching an action thriller movie. Also like to note not once they present the japanese side of the story. If you like a quick thrill but dont want to learn this is for you."
3,the miniseries from the perspective of a 91 yr. old,"i ordered this for my 91 yr. old father who fought in ww II in the south pacific, mostly guadacanal. it was for his 91st birthday and he was so excited to get it. he said that he was there over 2 yrs. and never heard as many swear words as he did the first 2 min. he also said there was some sex in it (he was going to share the dvd with his pastor; not now) while it is my fault for not looking into it closer, i just assumed that it was actual footage or at least, interviews by actual marines and that it wouldn't be hollywoodized! i am sorry that i bought it and am ashamed that this greatest generation was portrayed this way."
3,Slow start,"Like everyone, I love Band of Brothers and had high expectations for this series. Perhaps too high. The first four episodes are very slow, leaving me wondering if the Marines faced any combat at all during this campaign. Finally, the story begins to concentrate on the trials and tribulations of the war itself, rather than hours of back story that leave us feeling no closer to the characters than when we started.My advice: if you feel bored and disappointed in the first two discs, stick with it. It gets better."
5,Realistic and moving.,"This movie will make you appreciate Marines even more.Very moving and realistic presentation.It will scare you and make you cry for those who served in Hell.Tom Hanks director, Nuff' said."
4,Nicely done as a tribute to our WWII Heroes.,"This series was done very well, but I still liked how ""Band of Brothers"" was produced better...that's why I only gave this 4 stars. I will definitely watch it again as I am sure there are areas in the series that I missed because there was a lot to absorb. It initially was difficult to match the characters when they were young men compared to their aged selves as the story line jumped around a bit from character to character. Bottom line, I would definitely recommend purchasing this series to add to your American History inventory. I saved $$$ by ordering it through Amazon.com."
5,Great Story,Purchased this as a Christmas gift for son. He watched every DVD in the set and said that they were in perfect condition and he enjoyed the story.
3,The Pacific,"The Pacific is very good, but lacking compared to Band of Brothers. The individual interests not as good, but I am into WWII anyway."
2,Its Alright,Good film. Again this is NOT Band of Brothers. More drama/sexual encounters and personal lives than war.No Hiroshima. No Nagasaki by movies end. Just OK.
4,well produced,"this is one of the better miniseries that I have seen in a long time , very well documented and produced."
1,Heavy Profanity and Sex,"I am very disappointed with this mini series. It is garbage compared to Band of Brothers.There is no actual testimonies of veterans fighting in the pacific as there was in Band of Brothers. This lack of testimonies makes it feel like this is a realistic fiction TV show instead of the real life anecdotes of American Heroes. There is no clear relation between the different characters, the use of profanity is excessive and mostly unnecessary and the sex scenes are way too many and irrelevant to the plot. Men in full frontal nudity, sex in every disc! OUTRAGEOUS!This series was made just for profit, no real story to tell, no connection with or between the characters, boring.DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
2,Male & Female Nudity! ***,"I bought this for my husband because he loved Band Of Brothers.... but this is not as good or as ""clean"". Band Of Brothers is a much better pick with a whole lot more actual war interaction. Also there is male and female nudity, both could be done without... not needed! Actually ruins the short amount of time they have for plot : \"
3,It's ok but could've been so much better...,The main reason why The Pacific isn't as good as Band of Brother is pretty simple. Band of Brothers is nearly twice as long as the Pacific. That extra time gives the ability to develop the characters more. While watching the Pacific you're almost begging them to give you more background on the key players. To watch the relationships develop between the men like you did in BoB. It's still a good mini series don't get me wrong but it just could've been so much better. The music score is amazing. I just got it for $38.99 on their Gold Box Deal of the Day. If it was any more I wouldn't have bought it.
2,Not worth the $.,This movie focused way too much on the battle fatigue (currently called post traumatic stress syndrome). You never connect with any of the characters except the Medal of Honor winner. And that was just depressing. This movie is biased by hollywood-speak and political correctness. Both thumbs down.
2,Could have been better,"I loved Band of Brothers and thought this would be a great series based on that. I was disappointed. There were several episodes that were basically soft porn and added nothing to the story. They could have left that crap out so my kids could have watched it. But besides that, there were long episodes that had nothing to do with the war. Band of Brothers was a 5, this is lucky to get a 2. I would not buy it or recommend it to friends."
3,The Pacific,"Not as good as The Band. Has no historical anchors and a lot more steamy sceans,I think they had to add the sceans to make up for the loss of quality content. Our family are real history buffs, had to limit what our teens could watch. We were so disappointed that we gave it away after watching it once."
4,The Pacific,"It is a good series. I am helped to understand what the series is about since I read the book ""Helmet for my Pillow"" and know a little bit about the war.IF a person didn't have a history background, the scenes, battles, characters, etc, might seem disjoined and suspect.From my understanding of these battles, the Marines, etc, my feeling is that this series is EXTREMELY accurate and unvarnished.If a person wants to know more about Peleliu, they might want to read the book ""Devils Anvil, the assault on Peleliu""Good series but might be disturbing."
3,More cerebral,"As opposed to other miniseries com remind WW2, ""The Pacific"" offersore time spent on the effects of combat, not kist the combat itself."
2,The Pacific,"The second CD was damaged and we just watched it in the past week. I will probably return it and request a replacement. It was a Christmas present for my husband, so I am disappointed."
5,Must Own,"I am at a loss of words after watching the series over 2 days. PQ, AQ--outstanding. Just sit down with you HD TV and enjoy this series. You won't be disappointed."
1,The Pacific 9HBO Miniseries,I didn't like it. I watched only one disc of the set. I was greatly disappointed. Sold it to Media Play for what I could get for it.
2,disappointment,"dont expect anything like Band of Brothers. weak and dull non combat scenes, dont get to appreciate the characters and their roles. does have some good, but brief fighting scenes. could have been MUCH better-must have spent the money they made on Band of Brothers and used that series to entice you into buying this one. Best advice, wait until you can watch it for free."
1,Not happy,"Bought HBO mini series ""Pacific"". Discs had scratches and last disc was so badly damaged it would not play. Product looked used and abused including the box it was in."
2,AFTER 9 HBO episodes,"Mediocre acting, about 40 min of story per hour and too drastic hollywood rewrites of Sledge's real life experiences. With the fine book ""With The Old Breed"" to build on, I think they could have made a much better film."
4,Good but not Band of Brothers,"I thought it was a good series but it was not at the same level as Band of Brothers. This should have been called ""The Marines in the Pacific"" rather than just the Pacific because that is what was concentrated on. It was a good series though and definitely worth watching. Hope Hanks and Co continue to make more of these types of series. I'd like to see as many as they want to make."
2,Not worth buying,"I have my own copy of Band of Brothers and I loved it. I can watch it over and over! So I decided to see this when it comes out. I went and got HBO just for this show. Boy was I disappointed. It had great action and special effects, but the story line was so dull and boring! I do not recommend this movie even if it's for $50. It sucked! Stick with Band of Brothers; better actors and story line."
1,Don't Buy This Book! Its wrong.,On the numerous pages within: the information that pertains to Allaince and Horde is hopelessly confused. The publisher www.bradygames.com is completely full of poop. If you want good info goto www.thotbot.com its free and acurate.
3,Dissapointing,"I was hoping to get a pure atlas revision of brady's strategy guide. (ie no class or armor information)What I got instead wasblown-up pictures with only npc's listed, no quests.30 Pages of NPC by alphabetical order.2 pages of flight paths, that don't have them all listed.It's perfect bound, not spiral, so its hard to keep open an flat.It's not a bad book, but I would save my money for a revised brady strat guide"
2,Disappointed is too mild at statement.,"Although I didn't buy this from Amazon, I still wanted to state my feelings for this book. And I feel cheated. I was expecting highly detailed maps, showing spawn areas, NPCs, etc. I would have also expected a series of maps for dungeons/instances. Instead, I've got a book of maps that, like others have said, are nothing more than blown-up versions of the maps from in-game. And there are some major errors; from mislabeled flight routes for the Alliance, to NO DUNGEON MAPS!! My advice for others looking to buy this. DON'T!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ATLAS !,"Sigh. What a rip-off. World Maps are just copies of the completed in-game WoW maps with little or no additional information on them. Town maps are hand-drawn and sorta nice, but since towns in WoW are very small, they are also pretty useless. In fact the maps and info in the original guide are far, far superior to this, so buy that guide instead. And the final insult, my hard-bound copy of this guide was bound upside down."
3,Maps ok--outdated--but ok,"Not bad, not brilliant either. Saves toggling to the world map, and allows for generic route planning.The tables at the back are nice, but poorly organized."
1,Waste of money.,A complete waste of money. I expected detailed maps of everything on World Of Warcraft. It is just blown up maps from the computer. Don't make the same mistake I did by buying this product!!!
1,treasure island 1989,"was very disappointed. this movie was made in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio when it came out on tv.IMDB and AMAZON also state that. Yet the movie studio puts it out in ""letterbox"" form witha lot of material MISSING from the top and bottom of the picture. I will stick with mylaserdisc copy until a full screen 1.33:1 copy comes along on dvd."
1,Fools Gold!!!,"I have to be honest about this DVD. This movie blows,....HARD. The acting is almostlike watching a low budget soap opera or home movie. I thought that, after reading someof the reviews posted here, I was possibly getting a hidden gem. Not so. While the starsin this are good, the acting, script, and directing are terrible. I tried to watch this with my twokids (11 year old boy, 14 year old girl) and we couldn't get through the first hour. I would givethis movie away without feeling bad."
4,Cropped!,"I'm so glad to finally have this film on DVD, a feeling that is somewhat tempered by the inexplicable decision to crop it from it's original 4:3 aspect ratio. It mostly doesn't look too bad, but there are a few scenes where bits of people's heads are cut off. Given that DVD players and HDTVs generally have zoom functions, I can't understand why someone thought it was a good idea. I also agree with previous reviewers that the video is a bit dark. Another minor quibble is the lack of a scene selection menu. I suppose we should grateful to have gotten this movie at all, but whoever mastered this needs to take a little more care with future DVD releases."
5,The Best Treasure Island ever!,"This was always my favorite of all the versions of this classic. Any time you can get accomplished actors like Heston to play Long John Silver and Christian Bale to play Jim Hawkins you know it is going to be great and I was not disappointed. I had to watch it on VHS for years but am finally glad somebody with sense put it on dvd. Thank you. Robert, Indianapolis"
2,Not good at all,"very boring, lousy acting , just overall a not good buy i cant even give this away it sucks so bad"
3,Decent movie,"I purchased this movie when I finished reading the book. It was fairly good overall, but missed on a couple small points. I guess I'll see if there are any decent movies that are a little more recent. (not a huge Christian Bale as a kid fan)"
4,Loved it,"This is the best version of this movie I have ever seen. It was in Blu-ray and the quality was very good. The acting was good, the people were interesting and the story was good. What more could you want from this movie."
2,skips,I love this movie and I bought it for a fairly reasonable price but it skips alot. Just wish it was in better condition.
3,Terrific film - lousy DVD,I have been waiting a long time for this film to be released on DVD. Unfortunately the picture quality of the DVD is poor and many of the scenes are too dark to see clearly. The video looked better...
5,The very best is finally on DVD!!,"In my opinion, this version of Treasure Island is the very best ever made. The locations are brilliant, the music score by The Chieftains is thrilling and since the dialogue comes directly from the book, it is excellent. The cast of characters are well played and of course, it is a great story. I liked it so much that I created my own DVD from a VHS tape that I bought. Now I can get an original DVD. Many of us have been waiting a long time for this.If you want more info on this movie, see the VHS version listed on Amazon. Many fans, myself included, have provided commentary on this fine movie."
5,Best treasure Island.....hands down!,"This is without question the best movie version of Treasure Island ever made. Charlton Heston plays Long John Silver excellently, a teen-age Christian Bale a superb Jim Hawkins and the other cast members are all Oscar level actors: Christopher Lee as Blind Pew, Peter Postlethwaite as George Merry and Oliver Reed as Cap'n Billy Bones. Directed by Heston's son, it's masterfully done. Wish he'd direct more films because he has a masterpiece here. The tragedy is that this version is so poorly known and hard to get. Quality is the biggest casualty in contemporary American cinema. With this Tresure Island the whole family will be entertained, experience superb acting for a masterpiece of literature."
5,one of my favorite movies (finally) on DVD,"It took awhile (just 20 years) to for this movie to make it to DVD, but now I can finally watch my favorite childhood movie without digging the VHS out of the garage.Admittedly, the quality of the DVD is not the greatest; there are noticeable video artifacts and fuzzy sounding audioI am no film critic, but I guess some criticisms of the film itself could be made, such as the sparseness of some sets.But the bottom line is, there is no better film adaptation of RL Stevenson's classic pirate novel. Heston and Bale are excellent in their roles, and honestly there aren't any actors in the film who play their parts poorly."
5,Finally!,I love this movie. It is about time that they released it onto DVD. I am so excited to watch it.
4,5 STARS IF THIS IS A WIDESCREEN FORMAT?,A terrific movie in every way. Hope it's transferred in an anamorphic widescreen format (assuming it was shot wide)? Can't find format info anywhere.
3,I wanted to like this more but...,"I guess this book is a bit too simple. The insights not that great. It feels too much like the 'chicken soup for the soul' series which I don't particulary like. I read a few stories and the stories got the points across, but it just wasn't very interesting or exciting. It feels like this book is targeted at elementary school kids or high school kids, so though there may be good lessons, I just got bored with the presentation. I guess if you want to communicate very simple ideas, maybe short stories (some of them are several pages long), are too lengthy. Maybe I already agree and live the lessons, so the stories and meaning at the end weren't so impactful. For young adults and kids, I think this is a great book to have them read, but not for anyone who already graduated from college and already somewhat mature."
2,A Medicare book,The short stories simplifies reality to the point that I found most of them useless.A Medicare book.
5,The best Christmas gift imaginable.,"It is hard to imagine anyone who will not delight in this book. Forget it is written by a Buddhist monk. Instead, enjoy it for what it is -- a telling compendium of wisdom wrapped in laughter.If you read, remember and apply only one of the 108 stories -- the one about Ajahn Brahm's father -- then you will have received your money's worth. The other 107 stories will come as a delightful bonus.I have already given away four copies of ""Dung"" and have just ordered another six.It's the best Christmas gift imaginable."
4,Enjoyable light reading,"I found the stories inspirational and some had me laughing out loud. Each story is short so you can read a couple at a time, and come back to it throughout the day. It is nice to have real life short stories that illustrate Buddhist principles in today's world. I would recommend this to readers who want something easy to read....""Buddhist Lite"" but very enjoyable!"
5,Wonderful book!,My kids age 7 and 11 ask for this as a bedtime read. good way to impart wisdom without being preachy. The stories speak to adults as well!
5,"""If You"" is the best song I have heard by silk yet!","What's Up! My name is Victoria Beck and I attend Hamilton High School. I love to listen to ""If You"". It justs makes me wanna do things that I want to do that people don't ever do. The song is very romantic. Some guys dance really nasty off of the song because it makes them hot! Silk is so sexy and all of them are sexy! Love Victoria ! Playa Victoria ya hear me!"
5,Elegant and Holds Up Over Time,"I purchased this watch 5 years ago and it has been running fine until now. Given its elegant two-tone look and how well it has held up, I would definitely recommend this watch."
3,SHOP THE ALL THE STORES FIRST,"This is the weed wacking string I needed. Home Depot didn't stock it, and since it was for the WORX weed wacker, I figured I wouldn't be able to find any that thin. So, I ordered through AMAZON. Fortunately or unfortunately, I found this string at Wal Mart. Wal Mart charged a little less for the product, but I ended up paying an awful lot more because of S&H.;As for this company, they delivered what I ordered and it was delivered quickly. So, if I can't find what I'm looking for locally, I would certainly use this site again."
5,Pass Through Panic,Excellent!!!!!!!!! Claire Weekes has to be the most knowledgable physician ever on the subject of panic. Her voice is so calming yet so filled with authority. Loved these CD'S.
5,This is womderful,"I bought the tape version of this several years ago. I've had problems with anxiety and depression for years.Claire Weeks was a God-send for people suffering from these problems. She describes how it manifests itself, how to handle it and how to remain free of the problems. But you must listen to what she has to say. I can't recommend this highly enough. Wish I could give this 100 stars.By the way her books are wonderful too."
3,Get her books instead,"I found this CD somewhat disappointing. It's two discs, but disc one repeats itself over and over in each track. It's the same message as in her book ""Hope and help for your nerves"" and I found the book to be much more effective."
5,Excellent,"This is my second copy of this cd as the first one got scratched. I've loved Claire Weekes for years and this cd is the perfect companion for her books. I listen to it in the car when my agoraphobia starts creeping back. Her voice is soothing, and the information is helpful. If you like Claire Weekes approach to anxiety, panic and agoraphobia, I think this cd will quite helpful."
3,?,"I am a psychotherapist and hoped this cd would be simple enough to understand and have a soothing, gentle approach so I can suggest it to my clients towards their recovery. Even though her books are good,Claire Weekes voice is, I found very stern and harsh for anxiety sufferers and lacked a soft gentle touch.Would it be possible to hear a preview of a cd before purchase?"
1,This is very outdated material!!!!,"Pass Through Panic: Freeing Yourself from Anxiety and Fear [Audiobook, Unabridged] [Audio CD]I'm a clinical psychologist who works with many patients with anxiety and panic disorders. I ordered this CD because I am always on the lookout for CDs I can recommend to patients and like to try them out before recommending. I was impressed by the reviews here of Claire Weeks ""Pass Through Panic"" and decided to give it a try. When I received the CD today I was very disappointed to find that the CD does not contain original material is in fact an eight-part radio series that Dr. Weekes recorded in 1967! Dr. Weekes herself died in 1990. The treatment of panic and other anxiety disorders has changed tremendously in the last 45 years since the material was originally recorded. I really think it is deceptive to be providing such out of date material to individuals suffering from anxiety and panic disorders. I plan to return mine without listening to it. Dr. M. Bridges"
5,Really helped stay on track,"Really helped especially after not having attacks for a while, this helped me get back on track and not give into the fear.... This woman knows what she's talking about and it really reasures people especially with the way she narrates:)"
3,Pass through Panic,"I was intrigued by the authors insight on the many different panic disorder. Unfortunaley it didn't apply to me and although it was great to get the insight on my anxiety she didn't really to it much. This is more of a refresher on what a Panic type is, rather than a recommendation for treatment."
4,"Keep coming back -- to ""Came To Believe""","I dip into this AA World Services publication daily. I find it best to read one story at a sitting and reflect on the comments and experience of the recovering person -- most of the short reflections are peoples' spiritual experiences in recovery and they range from the ""bolt of lightening"" to the slow emergence of everyday spirituality. Keep it with your morning or evening meditation book(s) and dip into it. You'll ""keep coming back."""
4,"essential thought on ""the God thing""","I love this book. I'm a twelve-stepper who came to the program from a Christian fundamantalist childhood by way of a period recovering from that.One thing I came to believe from reading this book was that a higher power is not comprehensible by me or anyone else living or dead. Many traditions have been established that attempt to essentialize something greater than the individual in ways that suit their own needs.I'm fortnuate enough to be very well educated. I'm not into fairy tales. I do, however, experience many things about life that I cannot explain. This book helped me to understand that whatever shorthand various humans have assigned to the phenomena of life and their experiences is just that. Some power greater than myself, however, is a simple concept.(I'm a literary sort and rate this book within the context of recovery literature and books that have made an impact on me. The prose is not where it's at with this one.)"
3,It was a good read,"This helped me in early sobority. It was a good read,helpful in selecting meeting topics and good for literature meetings."
1,Not what I'd hoped,"While I love the writings of Bill W, this insipid, badly written and smarmy book was just not my cup of tea."
5,Best. Pooper Scooper. Ever!!!!,"Man, my days of digging around for that little turd stuck to some piece of wet grass are over! And the tread gently massages the lawn!"
5,Well-Crafted Debut Novel,"As Long As There Is Loveby Karen White-OwensReview by Barbara PatteeKaren White-Owens has written a stirring romance novel composed of complex, yet realistic, characters. Throughout her debut novel, the super charged emotions and palpable tension can be felt.The roller coaster relationship between single mother and business owner Cameron Butler and her former lover pediatrician Marek Redding, as well as the impact of interfering family members and a threat to Cameron&#65533;s business will keep you riveted to White-Owens&#65533;s great story development.I recommend this well-crafted novel to anyone interested in a beautifully written romance, and I look forward to more from Karen White-Owens."
3,Ok read,"Would like to know who the brother is on the cover seeing that Marek is either white or very light skinned. The story of pregnant woman having baby without telling the ex lover father is not new to this genre.I never understand why any woman would deliberatly do that to their child unless they fear for their life from the father. This is one tale where I sided with Marek from the beginning, Cameron despite raising her child singlehandledly, running her business and still being a young girl of 26 came across as someone with very little backbone at first. Once her father came on the scene I understood why she was the way she was. I felt sorry for the Greg character and hope he gets the love he deserves in a connecting story. I agree with the other reviewers that the families reasons disapproval of the relationship is never explained - is it racial or class or what? So this does not make sense to the plot hence I give it 3 stars."
5,Polished Brass Table Lamp,"I am de-lighted with this lamp! It is beautiful and has a broad, weighted base for stability. The brass finish is gleaming, the swing arm is easy to use and locks in closed position if you want. The shade is pleated and perfectly complements the lamp in size and color. I was a little worried after reading the review of the customer who said two deliveries of this lamp yielded a broken lamp both times. But in my opinion, this lamp was responsibly packed in a styrofoam form that protected lamp and shade perfectly.This lamp is even better than I expected, and for $20 it is a fine value!"
1,Arrived broken -- twice!,"I ordered this from Amazon, and it arrived in a crushed box within a box, and the switch/knob broken off. The lamp was functional, but not user friendly -- I needed a pair of needle-nosed pliers to turn it on and off. I figured this was just a fluke, so I exchanged it for another. The second lamp sent had exactly the same problem. I gave up and just fixed it. It's a superficial problem, true, but it's one that wouldn't have happened twice in a row if there was any sort of quality control going on. Oh, yeah, and the lampshade that came with it is sorta rumpled. I may replace it."
3,What a find!,"This was such a find! When I first ordered and received Choch (my name for our lobster), I must admit that my boyfriend and I were salivating.However, as soon as Choch got friendly with our cats Lucy and Linus, it was love at first sight. We couldn't bring ourselves to cook their new best friend ... especially since he was kind of the father figure in the group.We've had him a year now. He's even learned to use the cat box and catch his own decomposed food. He's an inspiration to us all. This year, he's responsible for our Thanksgiving Grace ... and he's threatening to pardon our turkey."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE... BAD QUALITY!!!,"I ordered 2 2.5lb lobsters for christmas dinner. These were no where even close to 2.5lb. The steamers tasted like they came right out of the SAND on a beach literally! One of the lobsters was cracked, with all the insides dripping out. Most of the packaging was cracked on the steamers too... and to top it all off, the chowder was discusting! I called the customer service, and they said all they could do was upgrade my next full paid order. I reported them to the Better business beaurau. Pay the xtra couple of bucks and order from legal seafoods. At least your guaranteed something good, fresh, and in good condition, with great chowder!!!"
1,Smaller lobsters taste better,"Not only is this item irresponsible ecologically, and obviously not from Maine (because of laws there,) but take it from a former Maine girl, smaller lobsters(1-2lb)taste better and are more tender meat. Think of this as eating a tough old creature... that's what you'll get."
2,Major Issue with Collosal Ten lb Lobster,I searched everywhere looking for a way to plug this in to recharge it but there doesn't appear to be any suitable receptacle in my house to get the job done. I really wish the seller would specify if this is a european type outlet or some kind of 220v receptacle that I currently don't have access to.PRO'SVery fun bath tub toy for my 1 year old son.CON'SBattery life is literally 20 hours tops.No way to recharge it.
5,a wonderful meal for two or three,"I got this as a surprise for my wife for our 10th aniversary. It is huge...... you will need some help to eat it, but it is a wonderful flavorful treat!"
1,How Disgusting!,I thought that amazon.com had a policy against selling live animals. This is really the pits.
1,Really? So sad.,"A 10lb lobster could very well be 40 years old, I think it's sad that someone has to indulge on a creature who's been around since the 60's so they can gorge themselves. I love lobster and eat lobster so this isn't some hippy vegan complaint. I find lobsters greater than 3lbs. to be tougher than the younger ones. Just my two cents. I haven't or never would order one of these out of principle."
4,Moderate views on legendary films for non-fans and students,"""The Marx Brothers: Their World of Comedy"" is essentially a research document for people not immediatly familiar with the classic films of Harpo, Chico, Groucho and (sometimes) Zeppo. The true obsessive Marxist can find better, more doting treatment elsewhere, but the beginning film buff will find solid background material, well-researched biogs on the Brothers, and serviceable summaries of the film plots. Out-of-date, but a good additin to a research collection if found"
4,dope,"This album is mad old school. Tracks like the humpty dance, wild thing and rockit give the compilation so much flavor your ears will have an orgasm. All 16 tracks on the cd are dumbhot so there is no need to skip any songs: you can listen to this one staright through. So, if u like old school hits, I would highly recommend picking up this disc."
1,IF YOU LOVE DICK MORRIS,"This dvd is great if you think that Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky were the highlights of the Clinton administration. There is almost no useful history in this at all. It borders on tabloid journalism under the guise of a respectable documentary. Dick Morris is interviewed quite a lot throughout this one."
4,Cute shoe,Used these shoes as part of a Marie Antionette costume for Halloween.. cute and also flattering on the foot!
2,Just OK,"I have to admit that the music was a lot more impressive with the visuals at the actual show. The music, I thought, would evoke those visuals but instead fell flat.It's nice enough music if you just want some noise in the background."
5,Absolutely Stellar!,"First of all, DELIRIUM is not a typical Cirque du Soleil show - in fact, it is a concert, celebrating their wonderful music and use of visual imagery.This show is inspirational, moving and touching. You leave the experience feeling better about life, about yourself.Walk on Water's lyrics (snippit): Walk on water, walk on air. Scratch the surface if you dare, You'll go further if you learn to skim. It'll all be so much clearer. Don't look in the mirror. Lay back, just let yourself slide.Other great songs include Let Me Fall (amazing job with this song), and Time to Go, Bridge of Sorrow is great as is Alone and Too High. This soundtrack rocks! Its all of the music from the DELIRIUM show on CD!I saw the show in Albany, NY and have tickets for both nights in Atlantic City NJ...wooh! Just a heads up that once again, this is not a typical cirque du soleil show - this is a live music event centered around music and dancing, not so much of acrobatic feats, etc.Peace all..."
3,Not Up to Cirque's Standards,"Delirium is not a ""bad"" CD or show, but it is not up to the usual awe inspiring standards of Cirque du Soleil. I am a huge fan, and love their regular shows. This arena show was designed for the masses and the unique essence that is Cirque has been compromised. The standards I expect Cirque to live up to start at ""Awesome"" and work up to ""That's Impossible!"". This music is good by any other standard, but by Cirque's standard, it is mediocre. I attended the show in Dallas and was very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this CD or show; it is better spent on ANY other Cirque show, DVD, or CD."
4,delirium better live,"Tha cd is pretty good, but much more mellow music then in the actual Delirium live show...but still worth it!"
5,What a deal!,These things are not cheap at the dealerships or anywhere you can find them. I bought this for a steal and then had an automotive locksmith program it because you cannot program this particular remote by yourself (as I was told in the description). It took him about 5 minutes to program it and all 4 buttons worked perfectly. He charged me $50. I asked him how much a new one would cost and he said he could get me one for a little over $200. This was a Christmas present for my wife who had lost her keys/remote a while back. She was ecstatic I had done this for her. ALL promises fulfilled by seller. THANK YOU! And my wife thanks you!
1,Only because I had to...,"This was required reading for my terrorism class. I have to say this guy is NOT very dynamic. I felt like I had to scotch tape my eyelids open in order to stay focused on the content. It dragged on and on and on...you get the point. It was kind of intriguing when I first picked it up and looked at the cover, but after that I realized it was not very good. I would not buy this book if I didn't have to and I will not read it again. The cover was the most interesting thing about the book. Since I HAD to buy the book it wouldn't have mattered whether or not there was an interesting picture on the front but hey a little marketing never hurt anyone right? If only the author, apparently sharing his own experiences, would have been a better writer I wouldn't feel so ripped off and duped. It is good to see that people can change though, especially when they come from the complete disgustingness of justifying violent crime because of ethnocentrism."
3,"Good, but not what I expected.","The title (Esoteric Tarot Revealed) and the look of cover with the image from Etteilla's Esoteric deck created the impression, that it would be specifically about Etteilla (Alliette) and his unique Tarot system I'm keen on. BUT, although the book does mention Etteilla a couple of times, it's about tarots in general. So, don't get confused."
