3,Chris Isaac-Baja Sessions,"Real good Isaac product. Demonstrates the uniqueness of his voice over and over and the subtleness of his writting. Many underproduced songs, but that's what is called for this time. His going to Baja to record makes it all seem like a vacation more than work. I saw Chris open for Stevie Nicks this week in Albuquerque and he is a very funny guy, but you can't tell that on any of this recording. I like this CD and think Chris could go farther if he applies himself. How about Stevie Nicks opening for Chris Isaac??? Hmmm."
3,One of Chris Isaak's best work. . .,"I'm not one of CHRIS ISAAK's biggest fan. I've only got one other CD of his - Blue. That being said, I did like this CD, but I'm still not a fan.When I listen to this CD, I can imagine myself relaxing on a tropical beach. It's not an upbeat dance party CD. I wouldn't play it at a beach party or at a gathering of friends. It's more of a mood relaxing CD when I want to chill out.I do have to compliment ISAAK on his rendition of ""Sweet Leilani."" My father was from Hawaii and this was one his favorite songs. He would play it constantly when I was growing up in the early '60s. It brought back memories of my father. ISAAK's rendition was exactly like the original. Who sang it originally, I have no clue."
5,Mmmm!,I think this is still his best! He does Roy Orbison better than Roy does! Really sexy Roy sound! ; )
4,Forget Jimmy Buffett,"Forget Buffett. Mix yourself a big pitcher of margaritas and find yourself a hammock, back porch swing, lawn chair or whatever you have. Then, sit back and let the sounds of Baja Sessions carry you away to Southern California or any other paradise you're long overdue for. The Roy Orbison cover is worth the price of the CD alone."
4,Someone pass me a Margarita.....,"In his followup to his carreer masterpiece, ""Forever Blue"", Chris Isaak takes you with him,to the sand and surf...mostly surf, of Baja California. Re-doing some of his best work, particularly ""Two Hearts"" and ""Back on Your Side"", with a tropical twist, Isaak adds some pretty originals (""Think Of Tomorrow"", ""Waiting For My Lucky Day""), and some gorgeous remakes (""Yellow Bird"", ""Only The Lonely""). The coolest remake, most would agree, is The Roy Orbison one, but I have to say that Isaak's cover of ""South of the Border (Down Mexico Way)"" is my favorite. So sit back, sip that margarita, and relax....let Chris and the Band take you to Baja....in style"
4,Baja Sessions,"Baja Sessions being Isaak's 1996 release was an album mostly featuring accoustic arrangements. The album has a few covers ""Only the Lonely"", ""South of the Border (Down Mexico Way)"" , ""Yellow Bird"" . Isaak has some incredible vocal skills and he is a modern Elvis. The booklet is alright with some ok photos of Isaak. There are no lyrics included but we get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."
5,Wash my stress away,A calming and beautiful mix of tunes that will make you yearn for the beach and a margarita!
4,Change of Pace,"After working through some serious issues on ""Forever Blue,"" this was kind of a surprise release the following year. Some delightful re-interpretations of his own work and some covers, notably a glistening version of ""only The Lonely."" Not seminal work, but a very nice album."
5,"Laid back; ""driving a rag-top on a tropical island"" music","Every selection on the cd transports you to Baja. It is, in a word, ""dreamy"". Isaac has a smooth and melodic voice reminiscent of a younger Elvis, however Isaac does it even better. A must have for ""grown ups"" who are tired of the progressive and alternative rock set. BUY IT NOW!"
5,Baja Sessions,"This is one of my all-time favorite albums!!! It makes for excellent ""mood music"" and it's also great for road trips. It's the first CD that my fiance' and I pop into the player when we rev up to go on a trip. :-)"
5,depression on a beach never sounded so good,"In a relaxed set, this album is easy to listen to. Isaak is a great singer (one of our generation's real gems!) He took his heartfelt song writting to the beaches of So-Cal, and out came the Baja Sessions. Every track is great. His songs go deep inside you and invade your soul (that is if you let him) He is a very depressed young man in this album, but he also is a helpless romantic. Anyone who loves great music, should own this album."
4,Alternate Song Versions on Vinyl Reissue,"This is a great album. I have the original 1971 vinyl and also the 2009 vinyl reissue. The reissue actually has alternate versions of the songs vs. the original. It seems that they used a different master tape to make the re-issue. Songs on the 2009 reissue have different lenghts, different details, etc. Also, the song order listed on the reissue sleeve disagrees with the song order on the record label, which disagrees with the song order actually cut in the vinyl, which is different than the song order on the original album. The pressing quality on the reissue is OK, but not super - a bit of surface noise (not too bad)."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Good Either","Red Alert was filmed in 1977 with William Devane play the role of Frank Brolen, Michael Brandon plays the role of Carl Wyche, and Adrienne Barbeau plays the role of Judy Wyche. In a small town in Minnesota sits a nuclear power plant that goes into meltdown follow by a sudden explosion. Enters Frank Brolen and Carl Wyche who must figure out what started the meltdown. Enters Henry Stone who's the plant manager and he's the by the book type. When employees start to die Stone orders the plant in lock down mode. Wyche calls his wife Judy and tells her to get out of town and fast. Brolen and Stone get into an argument over the lock down which leads to Wyche going in any way. Things start to get worst and it's up to Brolen to get in to not only **** his Partner but the other workers. I bought this movie because of Adr8ienne Barbeau and I was disappointed. She didn't have a big part and for that reason I'm giving this movie 3 weasel stars."
4,America's Secret Courts,"Scully tells the story of the United States Court for China (1905 to 1943) well. Through meticulous research she has traced the history of one of America's few extraterritorial courts. She includes reference to numerous cases decided by the court as well as the the dirty politics behind, sometimes successful, attempts to get rid of the judges."
1,Couldn't imagine a bigger waste of time,This book's author is condescending towards the reader. The answers are out of date. Topics are only superficially covered. For a good review book for the family practice boards take a look at Marshal's book (ISBN 0-8151-2785-5).
3,Good for StepIII but too much editor propaganda,"The book was helpful for step III, although it just covers the bare minimum. I would supplement with another review book, especially for surgery and emergency med. The main problem is that at least one question in each section has no real answer (it get's really annoying after a while!). The purpose of these phantom questions is to provide a soap box for the editors to make politically correct statements, mostly blowing hot air about drug companies and big bad ""business"", etc. Good luck on your exams."
3,Great introduction to the Hugh Corbett series,"The series, especially the later novels are wonderful reads. This is the first of that series and sets the groundwork for the stories to come. In its own right a very good novel."
4,Great pictures & stories,"That pretty much says it all, I guess. One caveat: the book deals pretty much exclusively with Wisconsin fiddlers & traditions, so ""the rural midwest"" isn't really an accurate description of the area covered."
1,Be careful,"I purchased an inexpensive Timex watch from the seller. It arrived on time and looked great, until I presented it to my mother as her birthday gift. We took it out of the box. The band immediately fell apart. Pins attaching the head of the watch to the band were actually missing (we confirmed this with a jeweler)."
3,Just ok,the spray smelled very artificial and didn't last very long. Doesn't seem like a high quality product.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This is book is pretty bad. The pictures are not very good for a pictorial about the restaurant - and a lot of the dining scenes look staged. The stories and anecdotes about Charlie Trotter are hokey and relatively uninteresting. A waste of your time, don't bother with this one. If you want mine I'll give it to you."
1,Not the Soulstice you're looking for!,A word to the wise... This is not the electronica band Soulstice!This band is a punk-rock band and the music is nothing like that of the real Soulstice. Buy at your own risk!
4,showerhead,"Good showerhead, the three settings change smoothly and are all usable. The design and finish is fantastic."
2,"good information, bad graphics","I was very disappointed with this purchase. Naturally, all of the written info is adequate, but the drawings are awful. I would recommend Trail Guide to the Body Flashcards by Biel/Dorn. The illustrations are great, the format is more efficient and user friendly..."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The graphics were ridiculously crude, and served no usable purpose. The information was ""ok"" at best. You can find better cards that are considerably less expensive. Keep on looking."
1,what is that,"honestly these muscle cards are a failure, how can something complex as the human body be shown with these stick figures of a drawing. It is hard to actually get a body to see these muscles so i relied on these cards to do the job for me, big mistake. When I saw them I couldn't tell which way the fibers where running, where the attatchment sites were (the bones have no detailing.) I'm now looking for another set of muscle cards hopefully not put together by a kindergarden class..."
1,Not so efficient,The vacume cleaning idea is not that effective with the sensor and the swabs are not evenly pressing on the sensor so it was a mess I had to use the normal swabs with a drop of cleaning solution to have the camera done.
5,I couldn't put it down,"For three days every time I had a free moment i was reading this book trying to understand just how our justice sytem has sustained for so long when everything that is wrong with it is exposed through the Terry King murder trial. I remember hearing about this case on the news a few years ago and all I ever really got from the media was how distirubed these children must have been to have committed these crimes and what was wrong with the children in the world these days. Little did I know that all the faults in this case were do to people simply not doing their job and just trying to put this case to an end and get a convition the easiest way possible. But even though most of the media just portrayed these kids as uncaring terrible children, Mollye, a news reporter genuinely wanted to find the truth..........something my be our justice system should have been interested in as well. VERY VERY VERY good and thought-provoking book!"
1,these 2 lil punks deserve death!,"NO WAY WAS JUSTICE DONE! THEY KILLED THEIR OWN FATHER BECAUSE THEY WANTED TOO.. NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT IT!SAD THING IS I WORK IN THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM AND WITH THESE KIDS, AND ONE DAY THEY WILL BE SET FREE TO KILL AGAIN! THEY CAN NOT BE REFORMED!ENOUGH SAID...."
5,The best of Kasse Mady!,"This album is an all time best album by Kasse Mady. It is a typical traditional Malian Music that mixes cora and balafon and the best male griot voice of Mali. If you are from Mali, born before 1980 this album will remind you of part of your most memorable childhood back home."
2,Not for my cat!,"I have a male cat who tends to be a 'high sprayer."" This box proved not to be for him--the filter at the vented opening at the back became quickly saturated to the point I had to block it with foil or plastic. I also found the top was tricky to put back in place--seemed to be slightly malformed and needed to be ""coaxed"" to fit. Once it was in place, it fit fine, but didn't go easily. Liners ordered with the box were also not particularly effective--held in place by adhesive tabs that didn't seem to work effectively for very long. They were supposed to fit the sculpted shape of the box and didn't overlap the edge. For cats who scratch a lot to bury waste, these are quickly displaced. Overall, this was a bad purchase for me--I tossed the box and liners after only a few weeks of use and went searching for a better product."
4,the Thirst for guitar riffs has been quenched,"This ""Intended 4 private use only"" C.D. Isn't that Bad, It takes a Few Listens but you start getting it, This Was an obvious way for prince to get back at his former Record Company WB, The Fans who like Prince's Glitter and gold stage will be sadly disappointed, Prince spouts Raw Expression with these Album, spouting dumb catch phrases like ""I Rock, therefore I am"" But still its great!, From the catchy Dinner With Delores to the Outro Had U, This is what Prince sounds like when he goes back to basicsGreat For Partiesinjoy"
5,An undiscovered gem,This album rocks. I like to play it for my friends who think Prince just makes dance records. They are blown away when they hear this because there is just so damn much good guitar work from the man.
5,Highly Overlooked,"I think people who trash this cd didn't really listen 2 it. With songs like ""I rock there4 I am""""Dig U better Dead""""Same December""and ""I like it there"" It is easily one of his most underated cd's. His guitar is amazing all thru out. GIVE THE MAN HIS PROPS and forget the fact that it was intended as a ""throw away"" album. Prince's trash is far better then most artists hits and any real music lover knows it. The only good thing about this cd being overlooked and underated is that 4 those who don't already own it U should be able 2 buy it at a discount. Lucky U!!!!!!!!Keep on keepin on Purple Hippies"
4,Greatly Underrated,"This CD caught me off guard. I am a long time Prince fan and I have most of his albums. This CD is one of the top 5 ever released by Prince. It has nice guitar work on just about every song. If you like Dirty Mind, Purple Rain, or Controversy I highly recomend this album. I can't believe that it was thought to be a throw away CD. If you like to here Prince rock then this is the CD to buy."
3,One of his most enjoyable '90s releases,"After ""The Gold Experience"" and 1992's ""O(+>"", this just may be my personal fave '90s Prince record. Sure, its merely a tossed-off set of throwaways designed to fulfill his Warners contract, but its just so much fun. A lot of rock-oriented tracks, with plenty of loud electric guitar (something we haven't been hearing enough of on the last few Prince CDs). Particularly good are ""I Like It There,"" ""Dinner With Delores,"" and ""The Same December.""Funny how much better this is than his previous contract filler, ""Come."" Yet somehow ""Come"" is often cited by fans as superior to ""Chaos and Disorder."" Huh????"
3,House of Blues,"This album sounds like some blues based band at ""Live At THe House OF BLues"". The songs are guitar driven and pretty good if you like Lenny Kravitz. Nothing really out of the pocket here. Good but not great or overly creative. Most of Prince's music is blues based anyway."
2,Hated It,"This was not Prince but instead this was anger toward his old record label. Only buy this if you are a collector as I am of Prince albums. Otherwise, go buy something you can enjoy."
2,Chaos and Disorder,"After much public feuding with Warner Bros, he agreed to deliver them one more new studio album, and promptly knocked this out over a long weekend. While the production doesn't sound rushed, the tunes seem like he made them up on the spot: routine funk like ""Dig U Better Dead"" and ""I Rock, Therefore I Am"" is prolonged by boring guest rappers; ""Dinner With Delores"" recycles ""Money Don't Matter 2Night""'s pop sound; ""Zannalee,"" the most enjoyable track on the CD, is just an uptempo blues. Lyrically too, it's all reruns. The silver lining is that, under pressure to create excitement quickly, he falls back on the exquisite lead guitar playing that he often displays in concert but has rarely recorded; the otherwise generic rocker ""I Like It There"" and ballad ""I Will"" benefit from this treatment. Michael Bland's drumming is also spotlighted more than on earlier releases. He's capable of so much better that you'd have to be a completist to want this."
2,Far from his best,"Well, after reading all the other reviews from very happy listoners I was supprised, I believed it to be one of, if not, the worst albums he has recorded. Not a single track stood out, even the single was not worth releasing. I must admit I have not heard a lot of this album, I rushed out to buy it when it was released, and was so dissapointed with it. It is a lot heavier than all other of his albums and is to me a simple Rock album, I am not saying it is not worth purchasing as an album but I just expected better from an artist that has produced such classic tracks as Purple Rain and Cream. A very dissapointing album."
3,I FINALLY caught up!,"The first time I heard this CD a few years ago as a teenager I hated it because ""it wasn't like his other music"". But as my musical taste has grown and understand that Prince isn't genre specific I actually like this album. While it's still not one of my favorites it's most definitely not trash. Less Funk/R&B more ROCK, so If your looking for Diamonds & Pearls this one isn't for you. A good Artist not only challenges themselves but their audience as well and Prince is definitely the master of that! Now if I could only find a place in my heart for Parade and LoveSexy LOL!"
4,The Final Cut,"The feuding between Prince and Warner Bros. (sort of) ended with this 1996 release, the final album of new material for the company.The 11 tracks were recorded between 1993-1996 and clock in at 39:13. A single was not released, though a music video was issued for Dinner with Delores. Prince billed the songs for private use, which is an obvious shot at the label and the tepid success on the album chart - reaching only #26 - shows that fans were leery of plunking down cash at the record shops.But out of all the chaos is some solid guitar-work by Prince and a cohesive package of music that is not a throwaway to simply fulfill a record contract."
4,"Chaos and Disorder, by Prince.","I know this record catches a lot of heat from fans, but this album is not bad at all. There are some real gems here, and I think that fans sometimes don't take this album for what it really is, a thrown together record, that wasen't mean to be some big time commercial hit. You can't go into this album expecting a ""Sign 'O' The Times"", or a ""Purple Rain"", because you'll be dissapointed.Most of the tracks on here are rock, and Prince puts his guitar skills to use. The best songs on this album are ""Right The Wrong"", ""I Like It There"", and the title track. I suggest you buy this if you're a diehard fan and don't already have it."
2,not his worst,while not his most average disc this one isn't the worst but it seems very by the numbers.it's patterened after his albums of the 90's in style which is lacking.
2,Title Says It All,"Chaos & Disorder is a bunch of outtakes that Prince gave to his record label merely as a means of helping fulfill his contractual obligations. Prince felt as if he was a slave to label and the music included here has a hard, angry edge. It's quickly obvious why these songs were outtakes, they're not very good. The album's one saving grace is that it contains some viciously good guitar work by Prince. He is a highly underrated guitarist, but he let's it rip throughout the album. This one is for Prince completists only."
2,Who Stole the Funk?,"""Chaos and Disorder"" is the final album Prince recorded for Warner Bros, and it sounds less like an album than an effort to satisfy a recording contract that apparently ended acrimoniously. The CD sounds unfinished, unfocused, and without direction, filled with several tunes that lack the hooks and passion we've come to expect from Prince. ""Dinner With Delores"" passes along nicely, but elsewhere, it's a nosedive. Half-hearted rock and funk stompers abound; the lamest of which is ""I Rock Therefore I Am."" However lackluster ""Chaos and Disorder"" sounds, it never approaches disaster. Still, the music represents a pale version of the former Prince who churned out classics like ""Dirty Mind"" and ""Sign O the Times."" A lot of chaos, and much disorder."
3,PRINCE NEEDS A GODDAMN LIFE FOR ALL THESE ALBUMS,"P E R I O D! ...but if youre a complete junkie who cant get enough PRE-ENCE..than this is one of those thrown-together ones, if you like raw rock & roll guitar etc (BUT THE GUITARS ARE ""RAW""...NOT POWERFUL). We all know Prince rarely made outright bad music, but this should not be high on your list..."
3,Bigger Than They Appear,"This Spanx Hide & Seek Wide Lace Shaping Panty is a lot larger than it appears in the picture. I thought this panty would be a ""cute"" way to control the shape of my bottom, but this panty is way too big to be cute. If you don't mind a panty that is large and in charge, then by all means, buy this! If you want something cute yet firming, pass on this panty."
4,Pleasing the Ghost,"If you have ever had a ghost come through your window, you can relate to Dennis. He is a regular nine-year old boy, but odd things happen to him, like he get's visted by ghosts.But the main ghost is his Uncle Arvie, who asked for three pleases, (meaning three favors.) While doing the three pleases, one more promblem gets in the way. The school bully, Billy doesn't belive he can see ghosts,and he must show him before Billy breakes all the window's in his house! All the three pleases have somthing to do with Uncle Arvie's wife. A painting unfinised, digging up his wife's favorite roshbush, and a sweet poem. Now, if this sounds like a good book to you, you can get it under Sharon Creech Pleasing the Ghost at your local libary. What are you doing just sitting around? Go get it!"
3,A fan of Sharon Creech,"Have you ever met death? Dennis has. In Sharon Creech's book Pleasing the Ghost, Dennis learns how to over come his father's and uncle's death. Dennis, a nine year old boy, is seeing ghosts and has actually met them, but his mother doesn't believe him. When Uncle Arvie's ghost appears Dennis starts talking to him. Uncle Arvie wants three things, and they all have to do with his wife, Julia, Dennis's aunt, because he misses her so much. Sharon Creech describes how Uncle Arvie moves in very little detail and yet still gets it out to you.. At the end of the book Dennis changes because he knows that he is very thankful for meeting his Uncle's ghost.. You will find out what happens if you read Pleasing the Ghost by Sharon Creech.As you can see the conflict in this book is Dennis vs. death.I give this book a three star rating because it wasn't as descriptive as I thought it would be and I like to really picture what is going on in my head"
4,Liked the plot,"I love Sharon Creech's books, however I could tell this was one of her first. Most of her books have deep meaning.I wasn't impressed with the description but thought the book had a cool plot, knowing Shsron Creechs writing she could have done better."
4,Pleasing book for fifth graders in New York!!,My fifth grade class enjoyed reading and decoding the dialogue between the characters in this bbok. The mystery of the buried treasure and the words spoken by Uncle Arvie kept the class interested and motivated throughout the book. Quick read and funny.
1,the worst book ever writen,"I Think this book is O.K because Uncle Arvie was a ghost, he had his own langauig and he could fly. Iliked how Dennis got to dig up a garden, paint a picture. if I were Uncle Arvie I would kick people in the face because they cant see me. My favorite character was Billy Baker because he broke two windows with rocks. The problem in this story was that Uncle Arvie was asking Dennis some stuff. But Dennis could understand. In the story, if I were a ghost I would eat the chocolates instead of smashing them. The end of the book was boring because the illustrations gave it away. I think it would be hard to write this book because you would have to make up your won language. The writer must have a good imagination. I recommend this book for young people because it is really fake and that it is boring, but little kids have good mental pictures."
3,Too much Waltrip,"I was disappointed that the Daytona 500 is not the complete race which made it hard to follow at times when laps were skipped. It does offer fun and unique features for following the racing action. Some sections are basically panel discussions with way to much of The Darrel :& Mikey Show. How can you have a feature on the Daytona 500 and its history without interviewing The King. There are a few quick segments on his wins, but not in comparison to his accomplishments."
5,Daytona 500- 50 years of the great American race,Gave this product to son-in-law for Christmas and he was thrilled with it. He said it is really good and he enjoys all of it very much. He can't pick out one thing.
2,Very disappointing.,"I bought this book because of all the rave reviews here and I feel as if I've been conned. It was not a very exciting read and, in fact, I nearly gave up on it several times. I'm not quite sure how the author could sustain so many pages of the same ""action,"" over and over. The ""secret narrator"" asides were informative -- if you know the code names of all the secret projects the US government has cooking -- but they were mostly distracting. It appears the author was trying to write two books in one. The first was a first person account of his wild experiences with a telecom startup. The second was a highly disjointed account of the US government's secret dealings in the Middle East and China. Why the author chose to present these two stories in one book is beyond me, since the two stories don't naturally interact in any way. In fact, the presentation of the spy stuff is rather forcibly achieved through contrived dialog and the asides of the ""secret narrator."" Why?"
2,Disappointed,"Don't believe the reviews here, if you have any interest in character or plot don't waste your money. The characters are caricatures, the plot is ""high-flying telecom company dies on the vine when the Internet bubble bursts"" coupled with repetitive accounts of people engaging in debauchery (which I guess is supposed to be shocking). It seems like half the book is people laughing about how drunk and incompetent they are and the other half is the author crafting painfully elaborate circus metaphors to describe how the company is deceiving investors. The only interesting bits are some random conversations about US black ops and subterfuge. You'd be much better off buying a non-fiction book on the subject and giving this a miss."
4,Devoted Brother and Sister,"Kerry Sullivan needs a computer expert to prove her brother Mark did not embezzle money from his bank employer. They have taken care of each other since tragedy took their parents too early and would do anything to help one another. Kerry tries to obtain help from security specialist Rafael Dawson, but he won't talk to her. When Rafe arrives in Tampa to work for the bank Mark is accused of stealing from, Kerry greets him at the airport and kidnaps him.Together they work to prove Mark's innocence.This is a exciting book with very likeable characters. Not just Kerry and Rafe, but the supporting characters are important and well written. A very hot read with a little light bondage!!"
5,Erotic Explosion,"I got really focused on the kink in IR erotica for a while so, I moved away from mainstream, then my girlfriend dropped off this book to me at the firehouse and I couldn't put it down. This was a sexy erotic explosion that is really fund and a great storyline. I'll give it five stars for being original and for giving me some new ideas for this weekend."
2,kinda snoozy...,"not nearly as kinky as the title would suggest.Sure there are toys and situations, but it's always what ""might"" happen, or have happened, but never does.Overall other than mild double blackmail, and a buxom virgin, pretty tame stuff."
3,Expected More!,"I didn't like this book as much asDecadent, from the Wicked lover series, the background plot seemed forced and sometimes things seemed out of character. It was a typical alpha-male who helps damaged damsel rescue her brother- but with very descriptive intense sexual experiences. The writing was not up to Shayla Black's normal level. The next installment,Strip Search, was recently released but, I haven't had a chance to read it yet - I am hoping that it is better."
2,Disappointed,"Was not a fan of this book for a few reasons. First~ The story line. I kinda had to start skipping pages because it just got to boring. Second~ While I did like Rafe(he is what made me finish this book), I could not stand Kerry(she was just dumb and whiny). Third~ The price is rediculous($12.99)?! Fourth~ This is just a personal preference, but why are the covers on the kindle books for this series so ugly and the paperbacks are beautiful?"
2,skip it,"kerry is quite possibly the worst female character of all the books i have read by shayla black. she is just so stupid and so consistently lacking any common sense it is actually hard to get through some of the pages esp those that describe her thought process. On the other hand, rafe (the alpha male)....is much more likeable. the book isnt bad but kerry abs ruined it for me; she is as dumbass ignorant redneck stupid as they get and it makes you want to root against her not for her. I would rec. many other books by this author tho, delicious, wicked ties, decadent.....all good...interesting likeable characters and good reads. skip this one."
4,"Exiting, romantic and erotic...","Very well written. A little unreal at the beginning. Great descritions and what is perfect is that the sex scenes dont repeat the same pattern, moves and descriptions. Really enjoyed it."
4,"Better than ""Strip Search"" (the second in the series)","Not as erotic as other reviews had led me to believe. I liked it enough to get the second in the series, ""Strip Search"", which wasn't as good as ""Bound and Determined""."
5,Rhymesayers do it again,"This is a great hip hop album. Slugs delivery and rhymes shine throughout. It is nice to listen to a rapper who has his own unique style, and is able to capitlize on it. Slug shines on this album and songs like ""The woman with the tattoed hands"" ""mama had a baby and his head popped off"", and ""free or dead"" will get stuck in your head. I personally think ""Lucy Ford"" is Atmosphere's best album followed closely by God Loves Ugly."
4,Not their best,"I love Atmosphere alot and all of their work including this album. I just dont think its their best LP out there. I still give it 4 stars but i dont think it can hold a candle to ""Godlovesugly"" or ""Overcast"". I would recommend this album to anybody anytime but if you are new to Atmosphere i would recommend picking up the albums i named first and get a feel to what kind of style and rhymes they kick. If you like it pick this one up.Once again im not hating on this album or saying its bad its just not thir best LP"
5,Huntsville Mobile Notary gives this book 5 stars!,"I was fortunate enough to hear about Laura's book before I started in the notary business. The advice the author shares is honest, unbiased and valuable. This is no ""get-rich-quick campaign"". She provides step-by-step instructions on how to get listed in important directories, prepare press releases and more. What's best is that she responds to your email if you have a question about her book. I may have to buy another copy, I've marked up my first copy with underlining, arrows and other important notations. If you are serious about the notary business you will read this book over-and-over again because each time you do, you'll find some new information that you overlooked previously. Looking forward to her writing Part II of this excellent resource material."
4,Inexpensive leather boots,"I could not ask for more for these boots, the price, quality (strong leather) and design. After all, Charles David is a high-end shoe designer and I got these for $59.99 and they're ""worth"" $259.00. However, if you have wide feet, prepare to having to take these boots to the shoemaker to be stretched. I'll never buy shoes that I intend to wear very often from Guess? again."
2,These Boots Are Not Meant For Walking,"In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big ""shoe collector"" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose !"
1,What a joke!,"What a joke! I baught it for my girlfriend and just got it today by UPS. When I opened the box, I found there is a huge crack on the sole. Also there is a scratch on the leather. The workmanship is not so good too. I'm going to return it. Still not sure if I have to pay the shipment by myself."
3,"Oh, Dear, What Can The Matter Be?","A puzzling, if promising, book. The writing veers from hopelessly inept to breathtakingly good, often on the same page (Where on earth was the editor?), but a large and well drawn cast keeps the complex plot moving and the pages turning. Be forewarned - I was disconcerted by the fact that some of the good guys get punished at the end and most of the bad guys go unpunished, and some of them even get rewarded. Victor J. Banis, author of TALES FROM C.A.M.P., JACKIE'S BACK"
4,A Great Cast of Characters!,"Maybe it's because I read this while reading the abysmal ""Flowers in the Attic"" but I really enjoyed this book. I absolutley loved the cast of characters. Everyone from Kenny to Ruthie to Inez had a wonderful story to tell. This is how novels should be...He was so cool. Oh, and I agree with the reviewer below me. Pablo rules. The whore with the heart of gold but with a gay twist..."
3,mexican flag,"These flags are a great price and worth the money for decorating.One of the two flags purchased did have a mild imperfection woven into the fabric, so if your looking for a perfect flag I advise a better quality.If you are using for decorative purposes as is my case, they are just fine, and a great value."
5,Great product,The flag was as described and I received it very quickly. I am happy with this purchase.
3,It's a $5 flag,"You get what you pay for... I think they made it out of tissue paper, but for 5 bucks it will serve its purpose during our winter olympic games."
1,"TOO THIN, LOOKS FAKE","THIS ITEM IS ABOUT AS THICK AS THE CHEAP-CHEAP TOILET PAPER FROM THE 99c STORE.. THE BIRDIN THE MIDDLE LOOKS LIKE SOME 5YR OLD DREW IT WITH A BLINDFOLD ON. DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP FAKE FLAG, THERE'S BETTER ONES OUT THERE."
2,"B- movie,not that good","movie is like a B- movie didnt like at all, wouldnt buy it again or even give it awayvery cheaply done"
2,mild monotony,"This album is pleasant enough, but it's weak. Few covers are better than the originals, and many of these sound really strange. Particularly disappointing is ""Every Time You Walk In the Room."" I couldn't help wishing some guitars were evident rather than the programmed accompaniment that dominates this album. Cliff whispers his way through all the tracks. It was not a good idea to team up with Alan Tarney again. He needs to team up with Bruce Welch and see if he can work a miracle similar to the one they pulled off in the late 70's. Cliff's had an amazing career since 1958 (yes, he really is 61) and doesn't seem to be your typical hedonistic star, but this album is a disappointment."
4,Over The Rainbow,"This is Cliff's first release of all new recordings since his year-long sabbatical in 2000. It has a different feel from many of his lushly orchestrated 80 and 90s albums. There is a stripped down feel to the music and heavier rhythms are used in the forefront. For the most part, the music simply serves as a frame for that incredible voice. The lead track is an unusual arrangement of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" with ""What A Wonderful World"" that really works! (...) An excellent CD. My only criticism is with the engineering in a few places. In a those places, the background is a bit too thick and threatens to muddy the sound. Cliff's powerful and crystal clear vocals is what saves those moments. Most other singers' voices would have been swamped. That's the only reason I can't give it 5 stars."
3,Somewhere maybe,"The guy has an awesome voice, you have to give him that. However the opening track ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is not entirely convincing. The rhythm track sounds canned, for one thing. The whole thing is loosely based on Iz's version, and Louis's clearly. But it just doesn't quite come together. There is too much automation, not enough emotion. I bet Cliff can do better. Nevertheless, it's worth a listen."
5,you can listen to this album forever.,"Freedom Call put out a great album in 2002. you can start with any other of their albums, but this album is great. it is for fans of HammerFall, Edguy, Gamma Ray, Saxon, and Blind Gaurdian. however, even if the above bands are not in your collection, you will probably enjoy this one. keyboards add a nice touch. get this album if you are a metalhead."
5,Happy Metal?,"I picked this up in a random moment because it was in the metal section of the CD store and had a cool cover. It could have been a hundred different styles and luckily it isn't one I hate.When I first listened to it, it was thinking, ""Oh no, not another Christian album."" However, after a few tracks, I realized it is not that at all. This is positive metal, an almost unheard of concept lately.The musicianship is top notch and the production is practically flawless. I really could care less about the production but when I do happen to pay attention, I notice things that many times add charm to the recording. In this case, I noticed nothing a miss and the music had my full attention.Really good power metal and I highly recommend it."
3,The Final Countdown?,"This is a 4 star album crippled by uberultramegasupremocheesy keyboarding. I'm a big believer in keyboards being felt/sensed not heard and it's obvious these guys are not. I hated the band Europe, I still wince at hockey games when they drop in the openening notes, and each song on the CD has a little bit of Europe woven into it. I'm not a fan. I mean, I HATE it! Other than that this is a fine CD that the vast majority of power/prog/orchestral/whatever-metal fans will like. Buy this CD, but don't complain to me if you find yourself sub-vocalizing ""we're headed for Venus. . ."" at odd times."
2,Cute but cheap material,"So I've had this dresser for almost 2 years now. I loved it at first. It's adorable and looks great. But the main part of the dresser is particle board. The drawers are so poorly made that if there is any stress placed on them, the board shreds and then the railing falls off. This is the problem I'm dealing with right now. The rails keep breaking off and the wood is torn. I'm having to buy a new one because it can't be fix. Very frustrating...So...basically. If you want a dresser that will last at least until your little one turns 2, don't buy this one."
2,Cheap...not pleased,"I would not recommend this furnature, after a year of use it has not held up well. Very disappointing"
1,Looks so much nicer on line,"We bought this dresser for our daughter's nursery. It is a much lighter color than featured on line and is very small as far as drawer size goes. The inside of the drawers are very cheap and we didn't even get the right peices when it was mailed to us. Also, it is shipped so that we are required to assemble everything. We are so dissapointed and hope that this review helps you. For the ammount of money we pay for this dresser, we might as well have spent $50 more and gotten a much better one."
1,Worst Customer Service Ever,"I ordered this dresser and a crib from Storkcraft. I have yet to receive the crib, but did receive the dresser only to put it together and realize the top piece has a crack across the length of it. I have been trying to get in touch with Storkcraft for the past three days. The customer service line is supposed to be open from 7am - 3pm M-F. Well, I called at 2:30pm PST and they were ""closed"" according to the recorded message. Today, I have called at least 5 times throughout the day and keep getting a busy signal. Additionally, I have faxed and e-mailed them twice with no response. I am very disappointed and am very tempted to cancel my crib order."
2,Not horrible but not what expected!,"I purchased this dresser mainly because of the price. It is exactly what you would expect for the price, but would def spend more money for a better quality dresser. Very poorly made, directions were incorrect on how to assemble, and what is done for you is done wrong. We will make it work for our 1st born's nursery but would suggest finding something a little more durable and that will last longer for anyone else who is expecting this dresser to last for more then one child."
2,Cheaply made,"When assembling this product, I ran into 3 problems.1st-the draw rails, that were previously attached to the side panels were not flush. With this being said, the drawers would not go in the dresser completely. I was able to get a drawer completely in, but when I went to pull the drawer out, it was completely stuck. I had to take the drawer rail (with the rollers) off, in order to get the drawer out.2nd-knobs do not get tight when assembled, so they will constantly spin.3rd-when pulling the knobs to slide the drawer out, the knobs come off their screws.For the price, you would think it would be higher quality. Find something else to buy. Don't waste your time. I am returning mine."
2,not a good book!,I was reading the book and there are so many mistakes in it! the author should have done more reaserch on Mandy! overall the pictures were good!
3,good book for its price,"Good information on mandy! Most pictures were very nice, but there were some not so great pictures and there were also mispellings in the book. If you had more money to spend, I'd buy other books on her."
4,Great price for two funny movies,"I enjoyed both movies, however, I think The Devil Wears Prada is funnier. I have watched both movies several times."
2,Not all widescreen,"The movies are both great but the product is not as described here on Amazon. 27 Dresses is wide screen but The Devil Wears Prada is full screen, pan and scan. No where is this stated on the packaging but only on the disks themselves. I truly resent the studios making you think they are giving you a bargain and then dumping disks that they cannot unload any more on the unsuspecting public. No one doesn't have a wide screen TV any longer and no one wants full screen disks anymore. If they are trying to sell full screen disks they need to label them prominently."
1,Stay Away!,"Even tho' ABKCO is still sitting on the ORIGINAL Recordings, this set is not worth it. For years now, ""they"" are saying the catalog will be released. The rumor is VERY STRONG that this is imminent. Do the artists a favor and remember them as real hitmakers. Chubby Checker, Dee Dee Sharp, The Dovells, The Orlons, Bobby Rydell and the early 50's Cameo hits like Silhouettes/The Rays, Bad Motorcycle/The Storey Sisters, Dinner with Drac/Zacherle are almost here. WAIT!!!!"
2,"Disappointed, esp. after reading reviews here","This is a bit cheeky, but after reading this book, which I got as a gift, I was reminded of how my ex would always complain about his ""Playboy"" when it would come.""Such great pictures,"" he would say, ""now why the hell do they think they can improve them with a lot of pretentious writing.""I felt the same way about this book. Except that the pictures weren't as good as Playboy, either."
5,Classic freestyle jams!,"This CD sure takes me back! I thought I would share that fact that the song by Trinere ""All Night"" is the original 12"" version."
3,an appropriately adulatory book,"This book is less a biography of these great philanthropists than a catalogue of the generosity they have displayed over the years. It gives ample information about the Greens' early lives, and it has useful appendices detailing the many donations and endowments these remarkable people left behind at MIT, the Colorado School of Mines, Austin College, UBC and so many other places.This probably of limited interest to an audience not already acquainted with the Greens and their philanthropy. Nevertheless, I am pleased that such a fine account of their lives and fortune is in print."
3,Mis-tagged size,"I bought 2 of these fleece jackets. Both XL size. One was charcoal and the other was merlot. The material feels soft and nice. However I was very disappointed to find that the charcoal one was much smaller than the merlot even though they were both tagged XL. The charcoal one was more like a M size with an XL tag. I had to return the charcoal one. BTW, the merlot one was not a generous XL size. If you are on the bigger end of XL, you might want to consider XXL."
1,Trust the Reviews,"This is a crappy fleece, the zip tore open the first day, looks nothing like whats shown. Has this crappy, cheap look, I am sorry i saved a couple of bucks buying this.Ok, ill make it simple, DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Crappy Item,I normally am a size L when it comes to a jacket. I am wearing a size XXL comfortably in the charcoal. The item does come with a funky smell that doesn't go away when washed. I did saturate the item with Febreeze fabric refresher and that seemed to help with the odor of the item. I do not recommed that anyone pruchase this item.
3,XL Charcoal is wrong size,I agree with the other review. I wear XL everything but the Charcoal XL is way too small. It appears to be mistagged. The sleeves only went 3/4 of the way down my arm. I wonder if other colors are the same or if this was just a manufacturing error.
1,Was sent the wrong item!!!,"I don't have a rating for the item itself because I was sent the the incorrect item. I wish there was a negative star rating system for Amazon's customer service. I promptly followed Amazon's return procedures and returned the item the day after I received it on 1/19/07. I followed up with an email to customer service a week later when I had not heard anything on the matter. I was told to give them until 2/16/07 and they would notify me when they received my return. I was emailed by Amazon on 2/1/07 that my return was received and they would let me know if a refund was due for their mistake. I have yet to hear from Amazon since being notified that they received my return. Think they lost a customer?; yes, indeed!"
2,NOVA: Solar Energy - Saved by the Sun,"Ok. Interesting, but not the DVD I expected it to be. I could have used a better description."
5,Great album,"Although I love Hitchcock the eccentric, he's not as much in evidence on this album. Nevertheless this, I think, is one of his very best - it never fails to touch me. Its a dreamy but mature meditation on memories and loss, with the feel of a song cycle, perfect for a fall or winter day. Robyn introduces violin on some songs to great effect, and his guitar playing and voice have never been any better. His songwriting remains on par with his best stuff, too - check out: ""This is How it Feels"" ""She was Sinister"" ""You and Oblivion."" And ""Heliotrope,"" sounding like a Childe folk tune, with this great line: ""I lie beneath the grass/My eyes are unseeing/My name is gone from all their files...."" Sad, beautiful and highly recommended."
4,"It would be 5 stars, but...","...it's just not suited for everyday listening. I love this record, don't get me wrong. I don't have such a difficult time interpreting his psychedelia like so many others do, so this record really struck me as very heartfelt, honest and very emotional. The lesson I learned with Moss Elixir is that losing someone you love is devastatingly painful, but for better or for worse, you do get over it. However, you just can't listen to an album all about death and mourning all the time...it gets to you! Be sure to occasionally switch to a happier record like Fegmania!"
3,"Way way overproduced, as usual",I wish he'd resist the temptation. He produces away all the great stuff we hear in his concerts. (I really only like his live albums because of this).
3,"LED's are ok, tailcap isnt as good as I expected","I had been kicking around buying one of these kits for some time to upgrade one of the 8 or so AA cell maglights. The LED's are pretty cool, long battery life, decent light output (less than the standard bulb though). The tail switch is weak and flimsy, feels like I am going to break it. The button sorta flops around in the base. Nothing like the switch on my SureFire, but its also a lot less expensive. So LED's Good (4 stars), Tail switch could be better (2-3) stars."
1,"Didn't fit, didn't work, no help from Nite-ize","I've bought the nite-ize LED upgrade, tail switch and IQ switch for a mini-mag 2xAA flashlight.I've thrown it all away. What a disappointment. I was hoping to get a reliable flashlight that would go easy on cheap batteries.The IQ switch worked for about 5 minutes before it broke.The (non-IQ) tail switch didn't fit my older mini-mag. Plus it is not sealed. I bought a new mini-mag light to try this on. After a few weeks, it quit working too.The LED ""upgrade"" was very dim compared to my original bulb. Then after a few months, one of the three LEDs quit working.Terralux is much better. Their TLE-5EX is brighter than the original bulb and it rocks.Their tail switch fits properly and works great. Plus it is sealed and still allows for a wrist strap, if desired.I need a reliable flashlight in my job. I emailed Nite-ize outlining the problems I've had with their gear. No response.They have obvious quality control issues. Buyer beware.Go get Terralux instead."
3,Adequate - that's all,"If you get this and decide to use the switch, save your tailcap. My switch failed after very little use (you don't have to use it, twisting the head still works). After about 3 years, one of the three LEDs has gone out - probably a bad solder joint since it can be made to go on by bending it a little.All in all, it doesn't match the durability of the MagLite itself. I'm replacing it with a new MagLite and their own LED version. I still have the old incandcescent head parts, so it will go back to what it was and live on as a spare."
4,works as advertised..,The photo shows 4 LEDS but it is actually 3.I am not having any problems with my LED or switch. Decent brightness..not focusable like they incandescent bulb. I also have terralux LEDs for my other mini mags and that is much better and brighter but for the price I paid for this nite ize updrage...worth 4 stars.
5,Great up grade,I recently purchased one of these upgrade kits for a Maglite mini I got as a gift for my wife. I am impressed with the amount of light it produces from such a small 2 cell light. I wish I had known about the upgrade when I carried the Mini Maglite as a police officer. Highly recommend and simple to install.
1,Destroyed 2 Mini-Mag's,"Looked like a good way to get better battery life in my lights. Worked great at first, but one day, nothing. I changed out the batteries, and it was ok again. Next thing I know, it's not working again. I switched it to my second Mini-Mag, however, this time, time it was worse. It must have been draining or shorting out my batteries the entire time it was ""off"". The batteries exploded and destroyed the inside of the tube of my Mini-Mag. I had to hammer the batteries out and they were split.When I looked back at the first one, same thing.I spent the extra and bought a real LED Mini-Mag. Love it.Just get the real thing and get on with life."
1,No stars for Niteize,If I could rate it with 0 stars I would because that's how well it worked. (In other words it didn't) I tried installing it on two of my Mini Mag lights and it didn't work on either one. I had bought two of these kits so rather than try the other kit I didn't even open it and returned both for a refund.
2,Only to avoid replacing bulbs....,"Pros:LEDs are supossed to last much more than bulbs (one LED broke in one of my kits)Push buttonCons:Not so powerful light.I'd rather buy a LED Mini Maglite, (it costs almost twice however) that really has a much stronger light."
5,Cuisinart DLC Work Bowl Cover,"Exactly what I needed to replace same item with broken clip needed to activate motor (broken clip is design flaw on Cuisinart's part). Researched what I needed prior to ordering. Amazon seller offered the bowl cover at a reasonable price, shipped it quickly, and packaged it well. Buying items through Amazon insures great service throughout the buying process."
3,not an exact fit,"The cover is supposed to fit the old Cusinart DLC 7. It fits over the bowl but needed additional force for the spring that trips the interlock to work. After putting in a small piece of plastic it seems fine. My Cuisinart is about 30 years old, so I'm impressed to find a part that works, even if it needed some ""tweaking."""
1,Didn't fit!,"although this was the product that came up as the one to fit my work bowl, it does not work with it which is very frustrating and now I have to send it back!"
1,Had to send back,"This product did not fit the cuisinart it was ordered for. Had to return product, still did not get a refund!!"
2,Look Forward - the Definitive History is Yet to be Written,"What a fascinating and under-studied subject. What a shame that the author was able to give us only one side of the story - no information of any consequence from the Japanese side. What a shame that the author is clearly not a native speaker, and the prose is stilted and clumsy. So many rough-cut sentences, so many baseless generalizations. I dislike sentences of the type ""They were x'ing and y'ing,..."" and ""They would..."", when discussing actual events which are interested in their own right. Analyses of battle outcomes summarized by saying ""they weren't lucky,"" or useless trivia about officers' reputed orientations. The book whet my appetite for more information about the history surrounding the battle and what led up to it, but far from answered the call."
3,"A full, but not brilliant history of a footnote war","The tragi-farce of the Russian Baltic fleet's around the world trip in 1905 to confront the Japanese at the battle of Tsushima is worthy of a good sized essay, but perhaps not of a book of this length. I read a lot of naval history when I was a kid, and was always intrigued by this story, so the book scratched an itch. But this version has no great insights or heart-breaking prose to raise it above the mass of historical works. Recommended thus only if you have a particular interest in the subject.On a side note, the science fiction novel ""Singularity Sky"" draws heavily on this incident for its plot."
4,Tsushima gives birth to HMS Dreadnaught,"It was refreshing to finally see something published on the Russian ADM Rozhestvensky. I would've rated the book with the highest rating had it contained the following: l. Britain laid down HMS Dreadnaught about 3 months after Tsushima, whilst awaiting the results of that battle, e.g. all big guns verses mixed main batteries. Tsushima proved it was the big gun which carried the day. HMS Dreadnaught was launched in 1906, consequently battleships built prior to 1906 are referred to as PRE-DREADNAUGHTS. 2. ADM Rozhestvensky should be credited for having conducted HISTORY's only all steel, coal engine powered, battleship fleet voyage of l8,000 miles. 3. Tsushima was history's ONLY decisive steel battleship fleet action ever fought."
2,Elvira -Great! DVD quality - poor!,"It is great to see Elvira making appearances on DVD again.Unfortunatly, the video quality of the DVD's leave something to be desired.I have a High definition TV and when I played the ""House on Haunted Hill"" DVD the video quality was terrible!Nothing like the single ""House on Haunted Hill"" DVD issued earlier, which is crisp and clear.The movies in this DVD set seem to be of a poorer quality than their single release DVD counterparts.If you like to see Elvira, then this set is ok, but if video quality matters to you, I'd suggest that you get the original DVD releases instead."
2,Eh...Not the best,"I love Elvira but this set of videos is pretty crummy. Every time she pops on the screen, the video literally stops...Elvira pops up with her witty quip and the video stops again before returning to the movie. It really sucks. If that were the only problem, I could probably live with just watching the movies without her commentary (and make my own). Unfortunately, the video is pretty poopy as well. The sound is so muffled you can't understand a word of what is happening and there is no option for subtitles; so if you are hearing impaired it is a definite pass. I'm happy to have this in the collection, but it will only collect dust."
2,Mixed bag of old horror movies,"I am (or at least once was) a big Elvira fan. I even went to see her perform live, twice, at Knott's Scary Farm in Orange County, CA. So it is with some regret that I give this sloppy compilation only two stars. Four of the six movies in the set are actually pretty decent, and one - Night of the Living Dead - is even considered a classic. But two - Brain, and Dementia 13 - are rabid stinkers, and even Elvira's campy comments can't make them watchable. Plus, the print quality of these movies varies from mediocre to poor. If you like creepy old movies, go get high-quality prints of ""Living Dead"" and ""Carnival of Souls"" and skip this mish-mash!"
3,looking back,looking at the other peoples reviews i agree but they don't take in consideration tvs werent that great back when these were filmed and it would cost to use software to fix the resolution.it would be nice to refilm using original elvira mixed with the better res and in choice of screen formatts .its just the tv show as it was broadcast minus commercials. wish they would release more soon. i don't think they plan on this going to blueray. they could put all 6 on one blueray even combine the classics with the movie mcabra in a blueray boxset.maybe call it a super set with elvira mistress of the night and elvira's haunted hills with transilvania 6-5000.
4,A Good Collaboration,"This is a very nice album, pretty mellow and relaxing but with a bit more depth than you might think at first listen.Kirk Whalum has a great saxophone style. And I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed Bob James' music, used to have BJ4, also a great album, on vinyl."
3,Nice,It is just what you see in the picture. It is thin but not so thin it will bend. Got a good deal on it and the little girl to match. Both are 3/4 of an inch high with the height of the ring on top and they are 1 inch high. Because they overlap you'll need spacer beads or something else between charms if you want more then one on the same chain (one for each of your kids for instance.) I went to Hobby Lobby and picked up some glass beads to space them out. Worked out well.Good choice if you want to honor your kids but don't want to spend $300 or more on the Kidz charms.
2,Read Winston Churchill's bio on Marlborough instead,"John Churchill, better known as the first Duke of Marlborough, is commonly compared with the Duke of Wellington, Admiral Nelson and even Napoleon as one of the greatest military leaders of his time. Despite this comparison and the accomplishments garnered by Marlborough, Jones fails to properly explain or highlight Churchill's abilities in his essay. Jones reveals little if any new material concerning Marlborough, in fact he quotes Sir Winston Churchill's book most often for a preponderance of the evidence provided.Marlborough can only be considered a brief, incomplete overview of the subject's life and achievements. Extensive prior knowledge is needed to understand the events discussed in this book. The contribution by J. R. Jones is a complete waste of time and money."
1,Has a clever title...,"I got suckered in by the title. Made it about 15 min. in. I think this might have been funny on paper, but in execution on screen...not even. Very amatuer in all ways."
1,Supra terrible Good,"This film was SO funnyBad it now just got defined by that word. the production, acting and well all of it was so comically bad, and there was No Nudity , which by definition of low budget films is required. It is the stuff of futureMST 3000 like shows for sure.IF your drunk , Stoned or just a freak of bad films you will have a Blast at how bad it is."
2,Pretty rough cut,What an amateur movie. The acting was awkward even for a put on movie where it was supposed to look clumsy.
1,I think they just got up in the morning and decided to make a movie??!!,"This movie was absolutely terrible.The lighting is bad the acting is terrible, the plot is bad, the story is bad. The girl in the black dress is good :)It is even worse than Killer Clowns from Outer Space.That is an hour of my life I will never get back..."
4,Strength in Weakness,"This is a classic Kung Fu film. Starring the same martial artists from the legendary ""Five Deadly Venoms,"" ""The Crippled Avengers"" aka ""Return of the 5 Deadly venoms"" because of it's use of the actors is everything you'd expect. Over the top Kung Fu, insane plot, bad dubbing and cool costumes. it's Saturday Afternoon all over again!Five men are crippled by a ruthless despot and his men. A kindly Kung Fu teacher and monk take them under his wing and retrians them to take revenge. Simple but to the point. It has a great pay off and the fight sequences are all top notch. If you grew up in the era when ""everyone is kung fu fighting!"" then this film is for you!"
3,Return of 5 Deadly Venoms,"Like most martial arts films made in the '70s, they're very cheesy, silly plots, filmed on low budget sets. However, the fight scenes are some of the very best and this film is all that. I really enjoyed it."
5,the most incredible physical stunts ever!,"First off, the REAL name of this movie is ""Crippled Avengers."" I guess some marketing dweeb thought he could sell more videos if he changed the title. Therefore, the plot of this movie has nothing to do with ""The 5 Deadly Venoms"" (but it does feature 4 of the same actors). 5DV has a better plot actually. The storyline of Crippled Avengers is pretty silly, but it's good to laugh, right? The gore is so fake and funny. But to the point--it doesn't matter whether you believe these guys are crippled or not, they are amazingly talented, they're wonderful acrobats and martial artists, and a joy to watch in action! This film does a much better job of showcasing their skills than 5DV does. No digital effects here, Baby!!!"
4,"Excellent Movie, Poor Quality Audio","A five star kung-fu movie, it even has a plot. Video quality is acceptable. Audio sounds like a mono record. DVD version is superior to the video version and a must buy for true fans of this genre."
5,AWESOME TOO,"I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE FIVE DEADLY VENOMS FOR A WHILE. I DIDN'T THINK OF LOOKING AT THE NET AND ONE DAY I HAD AND I'M HAPPY I DID. AND TO FIND IT ON DVD WAS GREAT. NOT THAT IT IS REMASTERED GREAT BUT TO BE ABLE TO REWIND BOTH THE FIVE DEALY VENOMS AND THE RETURN OF THE FIVE DEADLY VENOMS AND CHECK OUT THE FIGHT SCENES QUICKLY WAS AWESOME. SOUND SUFFERS, BUT THE DRIVE-IN MOVIE STYLE OF THE 70'S IS STILL THERE! FORGET AN INTRICATE PLOT WITH THESE TYPE OF MOVIES. WE KNOW THEY KILLED THE TEACHER OR OWE SOMEONE SOMETHING. THE SPEED AND QUICKNESS OF THE FIGHT..."
1,IT AIN'T NO CELESTIAL PICTURES RELEASE !!!!,"THIS DVD LIKE SO MANY RELATED TO THE SHAW BROTHERS COLLECTION, THAT ARE NOT RELEASED BY CELESTIAL PICTURES ARE A SHAM !!! I WILL NOT SUPPORT SOME LOW DOWN PIRATES LOOKING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK !!! IF IT AIN'T A CELESTIAL RELEASE IT AIN'T WORTH A DIME !!!"
3,"good, but had nothing to do with the original story.","Great fight scenes, neat ideas. I had hoped it was a sequel to the 5 Deadly Venoms and would feature the further exploits of the Poison Clan but alas, this had nothing to do with that movie except for the actors."
3,Return of the 5 Deadly Venoms...,"It doesn't compare to it's predecessor, but still, the Kung Fu action and storyline are decent. Three stars!"
4,A TRUE CLASSIC,"This movie was great, I have this version and I found the picture quality just fine, not quite as good as my Master Killer series which is crystal clear(distributed by Red Sun, who I had never heard of). But the movie itself is just wonderful. If you don't know the story, I'll tell you real briefly. A guys son gets his hands chopped off at the start of the movie, after his son gros up and finally gets his iron hands, he, his dad, and his dad's sidekick go around crippling people for the fun of it. So that is why this movie is really called the crippled avengers. The only reason that I didn't give this movie 5 stars is that the fact that the fighting is really good acrobatic wise, but I just did't get a sense of realism. If it looked a little more real, I would consider it like a top 20 movie ever."
5,They did a better job then 5 Deadly Venoms,5 Stars one for each of the Venoms!These guys really rock. They must have know the success of 5 was awesome because they took even better care and more time to get this Kung Fu stuff right. This is a must see. Even better then 5 Deadly venoms. I think everyone knows its not the original title. The venoms died in the last one. This one has some pretty amazing scenes in it. Just get this version. Its pretty good and clear. I don't know about the Hong Kong Celestial pictures and the rights. What I do know is that some company's sell this DVD here in the USA and its good that they do so we can enjoy it. I have seen bootleg dvds before and this sure don't look it to me. So enjoy and Kung Fu Rockem Sockem Get this DVD now!
5,One Of The Best Self-Improvement Book of the Century,"The Millionaire Mindset is one of the best self-improvement books of the century. The concepts mentioned in this book are awesome and mind-blowing. If you seriously WANT to become wealthy, you must read this book!!!"
1,unhappy,"I bought this torque wrench and was pleased until it gave an ERR message and would not work properly. It has had light use and should have lasted years, not just long enough to be out of warranty."
2,"Ratcheting device broke after two uses, no customer support","The ratcheting device broke after only two uses. Unfortunately, since these two uses were a few months apart, I was unable to return the items and the company which makes the product was impossible to contact for some kind of warranty replacement. I can still get it to work (for torque) but have to hold the ratchet lever in place with my finger as I do it or else it pops out. It is very annoying, especially when torquing things down in awkward places under the car. I also have the 1/2"" version and have had better luck with that one so far."
1,Torque Wrench: Good For Display Only,"This torque wrench has a beautiful mechanical build quality. You could display it in a glass case at a museum. I love GearWrench tools. I have a toolbox full of them. However, this is one tool I cannot recommend. I purchased this item 3 months ago and used it twice to torque the lug nuts on one BMW (90ft-lb). The first time it worked great. It failed on the second use. It displays ""ERR"" on the screen. According to other reviews this is a common problem. It is similar to the Craftsman wrench which is having the same problems. I assume they're using the same internals. Go with a mechanical wrench or step up to the Snap On model."
3,Not Recommended!,"Get her early albums - I recommend 'Blue' or 'Court & Spark', her two finest - but definitely not 'Hits'. While it does serve up a fair amount of her succesful singles, it is neither a definitive retrospect or a smooth listening experience. Spanning such a lengthy career, filled with so many new directions, I don't see how it could be. Her classic period isn't given nearly enough attention, and the last half of 'Hits' is rather weak.Mitchell has put out some great albums and classic songs, but does not lend herself to compilation very well - at least one that attempts to go over her entire career in just fifteen songs. And I don't think this record even takes a very good shot at it."
5,Blast from the past and more,"The 1960s had their share of sad and wistful hits, and Joni Mitchell was behind more than a few. ""Both Sides Now"" and ""The Circle Game"" were coffehouse favorites well into the 70s, when folk rock was fading and mindless disco was taking over the AM and FM airwaves. But even in the post-modern world of the early 21st century, Joni's sweet, sad sounds still satisfy. ""Hits,"" a compendium of Joni's most popular music, gives us the exquisitly-produced and syncopated big hits like ""Help Me"" and ""Free Man in Paris"" but a few lesser-known work as well. ""Hits"" covers the peak of Joni's career and stays firmly on the pavement, but even the casual listener will appreciate the strength of her melodies, the complexity of her arrangements and the bittersweet soulfulness of her lyrics.I listen to ""Hits"" over and over and love it more every time."
5,Highly recommended!,"This recording is a must for horn players and aficionados! Wallendorf and Willis, both hornists with the Berlin Philharmonic, deliver technically masterful and musically exciting performances, playing three of the four known concertos for two horns written by Antonio Rosetti. (The fourth can be heard on CPO 999 621.) This includes the oft-recorded E-flat major concerto that is usually (and erroneously) attributed to either Joseph or Michael Haydn. These performances are more driven than the lovely yet somehow-too-polite recordings by the Tylsar brothers, and more musically sensitive than the bravado-laden blows of Hermann Baumann. It's quickly become one of my favorite horn CDs (and I have a lot!).The Notturno, while pleasant, is really just an afterthought."
5,Poirot Entertains Again,I have all the modern(BBC) David Suchet DVDs of him playing Poirot. All of them are very entertaining and are more enjoyable than 98% of anything else on TV. Watch them all and be happy.
5,poirot series 6,"great series, great stories great plots a timeless classics as always i really loved this series especially the interaction with all the characters"
5,He IS Poirot.,"Hands down, David Suchet does not define Poirot, he has captured the essence of ""Poirot"". Others are interesting, Suchet isthe ""standard""."
5,poirot,This was an excellent quality DVD. There was no duplication on this series with the other episodes in the series.
1,Aruba,"Plastic plot, terrible acting by Insp. Japp. The Poirot series has lost it's allure and could do with intellectual characters."
5,"The best of the best, all in one place!","I love this book!! There is space for over 1,000 recipes, and pockets on all the dividers to store clippings. I have all my favorite recipes permanently written in, and if there are recipes I would like to try, they go in the pockets. The front of each page is lined all the way down, and the back is lined and divided into two spaces for two recipes. There are six different sections. There is also a space to write in your favorite cookbooks, and in each section there is room to index your recipes so you'll know where you found them in the original book and which page they are on in that particular section. I couldn't recommend this cookbook more!!"
3,not all I hoped for,"The book description, (one book for writing 1000 favorite recipes), is not accurate. There is only room to write 285 complete recipes. There is, however, room to write 648 recipe titles and the name of the cookbook in which they appear."
1,Not New,The recipe book has recipes written in it... And on the Index pages. A huge disappointment. Plus the binder has broken after only a couple times of opening the book.
5,Buy it with 'Power To The People And The Beats',"I have read many complaints about Public Enemy's installment in UMG's '20th Century Masters' series here on Amazon. And I definitely understand why people are complaining. There are tons of missing tracks, most notably 'Rebel Without A Pause.'But if you buy it with 'Power To The People And The Beats,' you have a great PE collection of all their hits. Each collection features songs the other one omits. This one has their duet with speed metal legends Anthrax ('Bring Tha Noize') while the other one has 'He Got Game.' This one has classic hip hop radio staple 'Night Of The Living Baseheads' and the other one has 'Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos,' just to give an example.Overall, I wouldn't buy this without 'Power To The People And The Beats.' If you buy both, you have a great collection of Public Enemy. Recommended. ENJOY!!!"
2,needs more tracks!,it is missing some other hits by p.e. that are awesome. for instance: rebel without a pause is a good hit not on here.
1,Avoid this if you're a PE fan,"This is a poorly structured greatest hits collection, and it is not endorsed by PE. It completely disregards great songs from ""Yo! Bum Rush the Show"" as well as PE's later (and granted weaker) albums like ""Muse Sick..."" Even if the later albums are not quite as strong, there are gems on those albums that are ignored here. Wait for a collection that is blessed by Chuck, Flav, Terminator, and the S1W's."
2,Poor,For those who care about such things you might be interested to know that (according to www.publicenemy.com) the band is not behind this CD. Apparently they also have a proper three disc set coming out soon.It'd be hard to make a bad PE compilation (because they made such good songs) but this CD is lacking.
2,Too Few Tracks.,The tracks on this album are great of course because it's Public Enemy. I just want to know why there where so many omissions. I could name you 15 but let's just say that in order to really get the Public Enemy experience you have to listen to all their work.
2,HAHAHA,"Wow! I've never laughed at something so idiotic before. This is the worst compilation ever. It's got 11 tracks which for one doesn't even cover 1/5 of Public Enemy's hits. Forget ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"", I'm upset ""Can't Truss It"" isn't on here. DONT BUY THIS. get ""Power to the people and the beats""(My personal favorite GH compilation by P.E.) or ""Greatest Misses"" instead.2 stars for having fight the power and still being Public Enemy."
5,Great Item,Once assembled they're so easy to put on and remove that you won't need to buy locks. Strong and solid they look like they'll last a long time.
2,Consider Other Programs,If you are interested in learning the Persian language via a computer program you should consult someone who has already done that. See if it'll work for you too. I know of a web site that has commentaries from people who have used Persian teaching CD programs...select COMMENTS from its side bar. See what they say before you purchase any program. Most CDs are junk. From this web site there are links to numerous Persian Teaching programs that you can easily find what you are looking for.My advice: do not purchase this or any other Persian teaching CD unless you have the facts.
4,"Persian Tutor , a great product","The Persian Tutor is unlike any other language learning system I have seen. It an easy to use computer software with games, quizzes, organized charts and notes that are easy gain from and simple to read.Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak has designed program with a fun interactive game, which enables the Persian (Farsi) student to travel a city in Persia.Check into hotels, shop in a bazaar, and go to a restaurant and more.The program teaches the Persian alphabet, words, and basic dialogue. A lot is voice activated, which a great way to learn correct pronunciation.This would be my first suggestion to some one who is learning Persian, especially beginners. It is definitely a fun and fast way to learn with easy reading unlike thick text one might purchase in order to learn a language."
1,Not worth the money.,"This should be a $5-10 piece of software. The ""interact"" scenarios provided are few and not all that helpful. Essentially all you can learn is directions or saying very simple pleasantries. I can say with confidence that anyone would be better off with an audio recording and/or book to learn farsi."
1,Absolute garbage,"Not only is this product a piece of garbage, it is made by a very horrible teacher. Its an all around waste of money. The program itself is outdated, slow and follows no real logic. Checking into a hotel or restaurant at a Persian city??? Ok, maybe for the retarded. The only good thing about this program is that its on cd. That means that it can fly a lot farther when you realize the mistake you have made."
4,Nice looking hat,"This hat is very nice looking. My only problem is having thick hair makes this feel like it won't stay on and I have to keep pulling it down to keep it secure, otherwise it is very nice."
2,crappy dvd,The dvd skips and it doesnt work properly. I was dissappointed when watching this dvd after i had spent the amount of money on it in the first place.
5,The hyper can,"Now this is good stuff!!! I love it!!! I'm excited!!! I think maybe I've had too much caffien!!! Yeah, I'm pretty sure of it!!!But really, this stuff is good. I was one of the first people to get my hands on a can of Jolt Cola way back when. They used Denver as a test market and I just happened to be living there at the time. I've been a fan ever since.It gives you a nice boost of energy when you need one. So drink this stuff and get a hyper energy buzz."
1,Poorly made,"Poor and sloppy craftsmanship. its not a very nice looking pin the color edges are not defined if there were another place to buy a ""love my wife pin"" i would buy it there"
3,Nice case but cheap clip.,"I love the aluminum case. It looks great and protects my ipod and has holes in all the right places for cords, etc. (unlike previous belt clip cases I have had). However, I have had it for only two months and the plastic belt clip broke off, just from normal use. I was at the gym with my ipod clipped to my waistband, and suddenly it was on the floor, the plastic clip still attached to me. The plastic bit attaching the clip peg to the back of the case had snapped in two. I would be interested to learn if there is a way to get it repaired or replaced."
1,Disappointed,"This is the message I sent the book seller: The Book is: Ant and Bee and the RainbowAnt and Bee and the Rainbow (Ant & Bee)Dear Mary, I am not going to ask for my money back. I should have gotten more information about the printing company and location before my purchase. The $50.00 price led me to believe that the printing quality would have been original. I already have a copy that was printed in England. The book you sent me was printed in Hong Kong. The colors are not accurate. The color ""red"" in your book is almost orange. The color ""violet"" is truly brown. This is not just being picky: a book about colors should have the colors printed accurately. The poor printing of these two colors will give the child the wrong information. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.Sincerely, Rochelle"
1,Not for new learners,"Probably a good format for people who know some Hebrew, are ready to travel, and want to practice key phrases. It has a map that lets you 'travel' around the city and speak with people. I had hoped to use it to learn Hebrew and so I was disappointed in it. It does not go into great detail so if you really want to study the language then this is not the right CD. I rated it only one star because for the money it didn't have a lot to offer even to the audience it addresses. Language products are of such high quality these days that I thought this just didn't measure up to the standard most consumers would expect."
4,"Really, really good.","This book was a pleasant surprise. For those of you coming of age in Manhattan and female, this enticing peek at what many semi-single women go through is really really good."
2,Could have been better,"When I picked up this book, I expected to find a more compelling story about a young woman coming of age. Instead, it seemed to be a collection of short stories centered around a main character. The players in this book were not developed well, I lost interest in them rather quickly."
3,"Self-absorbed story-teller, but touching insights","I felt this story inhabited the mind of a slightly narcissistic storyteller. That said, I found some wonderful things in it, including the spare, fluid style of writing. I also thought the author had many wise insights into the human heart, a couple of which really touched me."
2,monotonia incandescente,"neil young a lo largo del tiempo nos ha sorprendido por su talento, vehemencia y audacia...tambien es cierto que a veces, en merito a su afan prolifico de permanente busqueda, suele ofrecer material de dificil acceso para el publico. hemos escuchado discos de young adelantados a su tiempo, incomprendidos en su aparicion y venerados luego, pero a mi sincera opinion, este no es el caso.....broken arrow no deja de ser un intento fallido de remontar al grunge. canciones monotonas, desprolijas, inconclusas que se pierden en divagues eternos..sonido atronador por momentos, muy sucio por otros..en fin, no estamos hablando de una obra que merezca mucha atencion...."
1,Such a nice guy it's a pity the music is so horrible.,"No question Neil Young is one of the really nice people in music. Too bad he has such an unfortunate whiney voice. Magnanimous with his time and money he contributes both to a variety of causes. From education to the environment Young has made his mark as a generous sensitive person. So it is with Crazy Horse. Evey few years Young dusts off these weary old 1960's dinosaurs and gives them an opportunity to bring their tired, boring sludge to the fore. What they lack in actual musical ability they more than make up for in volume and cliche'. Ugh."
4,Young and Crazy.,"It took me a few years to get this album, but once I did I was glad. It's not far off from most albums he released in the 90's. Any fan of ""Freedom"", ""Sleeps With Angels"", or ""Mirror Ball"" should get into it easily. The majority of the songs are long jams, and ""Neil"" and ""Crazy Horse"" rock as expected. ""Music Arcade"" is the only real softy, and would fit well on ""Silver And Gold"". Overall, casual fans might look elsewhere, but true ""Neil Young"" fans should like this ""Big Time"". I actually heard that song on the radio today."
4,Listen again,"Everybody, including those who should know better (critics) has missed the central point of this album: the death of Crazy Horse producer David Briggs. He has shaped the sound since '69, and these songs are the first without him. And they are beautiful songs, musically and lyrically. As Neil once said, ""a broken arrow usually means someone has lost a lot..."""
5,THIS IS REALLY GOOD!!!,"Granted, ""Baby, what you want me to do?"" is not the greatest song, but other than that there is not a weak track on the album. As for some of the songs being too long, what is wrong with that? Are you telling me that Cowgirl In The Sand, Down By The River, Cortez The Killer and Like A Hurricane are not good songs because they are long? Get real. This album rocks. I agree with several of the other reviewers in that these songs are mesmerizing. It also contains one of Neil's best acoustic songs, ""Music Arcade"", which alone justifies the price of the CD. An absolutely beautiful song. Indispensable if you are a Neil fan."
4,Good album,"Not one of Neil's best albums, but it still is amazing to listen to. Totally worth buying for any Neil Young fan!"
5,"""We are not saints""","""Bill W."" I feel is a very good book about Bill Wilson and even though I did not like reading it the first time, I read it again with an open mind. It helped me understand the man and why he was able to become co-founder of AA and write the Big Book ""Alcoholics Anonymous."" If he did not have problems, he would not have been able to do this, and in reading ""Bill W."", it has helped me understand what we all go through in life. Be as honest as possible today, do the next right thing and remember ""We are not saints."""
1,disappointed,There is much conjecture and minimal facts. There is a focus on drawing conclusions for the reader and not much substance. Poor read.
1,Jumbled and Pointless,"Can't follow author's writing style or points he is making. Other Bill W bios, Pass It On or Thomsen's Bill W have same info and read better."
1,Makes A Good Doorstop,"Most of us know that Bill Wilson was human, not a Saint. It's a shame that St. Martin's Press would see fit to publish a poorly documented ranting such as this, written by a disgruntled former servant of Bill's widow, Lois Wilson. I can only hope that a properly researched and documented biography will be done, to put Bill's humanity in perspective. A shame that the formerly solid St. Martin's Press has now joined the ranks of the lesser tabloids in their editorial due diligence process."
5,Very cute,"With a son named William who loves trains, I couldn't pass this up. I love the illustrations. The story is cute."
1,We found it boring.,We ordered several train books from Amazon for our 3 yr old grandson. He is a train fanatic. This book was the most boring one. Neither the child nor the adult reading it liked it much.
4,ROOTIN' - TOOTIN' GOOD WESTERN,"This is an oldie, but goodie, dating back to 1984 #62, and this time Longarm finds himself in Virgina City with all the bawdy houses, back-stabbing outlaws, fine felines and folks needing help from "" a real US Marshal."" Longarm meets his match with a struggling lady journalist - she's hot and anxious to learn the ropes. As always, a good western yarn with lots of action and bad guys biting the dust."
5,An elegantly written Oral Mexican History.,"Victor E. Villasenor cleverly leads the reader into Mexican and Mexican American history through his own journy and the journy of his family. As a first generation Mexican, Victor Villasenor struggles to find meaning in a world that has been all but welcoming. In his search for meaning he begins with stories/Oral history handed down to him by his mother, that at times seemed surreal. In his quest, he finds himself back in Mexico were many of his family stories originated. It is through this passage he find the magic of perseverance and the ture meaning of healing and pride. Walking Stars is the light inside all of our hearts."
3,Not what I expected,"I found his writing to be easy to read, it was not the type of book I expected with the subtitle ""Stories of Magic and Power."" I found this book in the New Age section of my book store and after reading this book, I believed it should have been with the other Christian books, that it showed the magic and power of the Lord. I felt I was mislead in the title."
4,Great product in a convenient little package,"Chances are that you're already familiar with this product, but probably not these tiny little packets. Well, it's the same great stuff, but in a convenient size. Ladies, put some in your purse, your car, your desk drawer, or anywhere else you think you might need one. Guys, keep one in your pocket with a condom on date night, or anywhere else you think you might be when you need one. Very convenient package for people who need lubrication but are away from where they typically keep their larger bottles of lube. Package is even small enough to be accepted by TSA when taking a flight.My only complaint with Astroglide is that it's too thin, it's not very thick. In use it dries out quickly and often needs to be re-energized with water...or spit."
1,B-o-o-ring,"I don't know what it is about this book, but it's totally unappealing.The writing style is dry and completely uninspiring.Didn't matter what page I turned to, I could not connect with either this book or its premise."
5,One of the three best books on the JFK assassination,"Along with Dick Russell's The Man Who Knew Too Much and Garrison's On the Trail of the Assassins, Gaeton Fonzi's book The Last Investigation actually provides information that enables the reader to move a bit closer to understanding the truth about the conspiracy that killed JFK. The book contains noteworthy information about key suspects such as David Phillips and Orlando Bosch. On behalf of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Gaeton Fonzi interviewed Bosch and was involved in assessing the possible role of Phillips as ""Maurice Bishop"" who was alleged to have met with Oswald prior to the assassination. The information in this book is a must for any objective reader to assess the liklihood that a conspiracy took place. One almost certainly did take place, and the information Fonzi covers is important to understand what actually happened."
5,Mr. Clean..... Definitely!,I had been looking for a way to make cleaning my apartment easier. With this Mr. Clean product I have found it.It gets in all corners that other cleaning products I have used couldn't. And it really works!!I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends.
2,Mr. Clean Mop Review,"I was disapointed in this product. It is harder to use and does not clean as well as it seems to in the commercial. The handle on mine did not lock in position well and kept sliding up into the mop. I, therefore, did not have the reach that I should have had with it. The pads don't scrub as well as I would like."
2,Same amount of work,"I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub. I am disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so I don't feel too bad about the wasted money."
1,EASY TO USE? UH HUH - DON'T FALL FOR IT LIKE I DID!,"I got this device to help me clean around my place. I thought it would be easy to use, and it is not. The pads do not stay on. When you are trying to put them on, the solution leaks all over you. After working on my shower, I saw no difference. I wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth."
2,Very disappointing,"Generally I like Mr Clean products, but I was very disappointed with this one. When using the long handle I found it difficult to control the mop head, and the mop head material is not flexible enough to allow it to follow the curved walls of our shower and tub. It's also supposed to work around the sink fawcet and behind the toilet, but it doesn't do either of those things at all. It's a great idea, but this model just doesn't work."
4,"Loved my tub wand, where did it go?","Too bad the manufacturers of this item have stopped making the tub pads. As one with back problems, I relied on this to help with my cleaning.It is irreplaceable! I'm so fed up with finding products that I like only to become discouraged when they stop making them! I would recommendthis wand highly to those with physical challenges, or you just want to cut some scrub time! Gets into the corners VERY well!"
5,Easy on the back.,I have 2 herniated disc in my back. This item is a God sent. I don't have to do any bending to clean my shower stall.
4,Mr. Clean,Works wonders for me in the shower. That shower was the hardest thing to clean. Great product to have in your bathroom.
3,Good and Bad,"I got my product in a prompt manner. Now I cannot find refills of the cleaning cloths anywhere except the internet. Also, because of some arthiritis in my hands, I cannot seem to squeeze the blue nobs enough to detach the cleaning unit from the handle. This is very irritating to me."
5,Magic Cleaber Starter Set,I love this gaget!! It sure helps with your back when you are cleaning the tub!! I loved it so much I gave it to a friend!! Not a bad investment!!
4,Love this thing,When I saw this my immediant thought was that this will take away the need to bend over the tub. I was right. We also have a tiled shower; floor to ceiling and it works very well there. The one complaint we have is the pads start ripping and have to be replaced often.
5,Love this kit,"I have the Swiffer, but I like this MUCH better. It gets around corners MUCH better and the scrubbing pad does a great job at removing those stuck on items that are so hard to remove. I use it in my bathroom, kitchen, laminate flooring and even on the walls. I can't say enough about the Mr. Clean Magic Reach. The ""head"" is also removable so you can take it off for close up work, and the wand is adjustable for the places that are too high or too far to reach. I DO wish the head was a bit bigger."
1,Don't bother with this dog (Zero Star),"Skip this entire product. I made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non-scrubbing (mopping?) pads. Now, I can't find the non-scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county. I think they don't want to compete with their own product ""Swiffer"" which they also manufacture. I emailed them and they suggested I buy online. I checked walgreens.com and drugstore.com and no luck. I imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful ""who gives a hoot"" rod."
2,disappointing,"This slim volume purports to treat 700 species of fish in 80 categories in only 132 pages -- of which fewer than half are allotted to discussions of actual fish. Brief, superficial summaries (only a short paragraph in many cases) of the categories are padded with long lists of alternative names. No substantive coverage of, for instance, culinary or nutritional differences among types of fish within a category (e.g. salmon) or wild vs. farmed. Virtually no information about sustainability or health concerns. Six pages of cooking methods that are about what you'd find in a good general cookbook. The nutritional information is thorough and useful, and the extensive lists of alternative names are entertaining and may be helpful when shopping. I'm not sure who this is meant for -- there's not enough depth for serious cooks and not enough guidance for novices."
5,All Night Long In 1983,"I was born in 1983, and 22 years later I will proudly say that ""Candy Man"" is still off the hook! Back in the 80's, R&B music was real and original, fresh and hip. Unlike many of today's singers, they actually had talent. Some might say that these girls were mere sexual fluff under the influence of Rick James, but I beg to differ. ""All Night Long"" and ""Meeting In The Ladies Room"" are fantastic, but ""Candy Man"" will get me on the dance floor every time!!!"
3,Memories Galore!!,"Awww, snap. I just picked this up and ""CandyMan"" is slamming right now! Brings back fond memories of my youth. ""All Night Long"", ""In My House"", ""Boys"" - this CD is worth having if you were a MJG fan back in the day."
4,Happy to find,"I have lots of electrical extensions that I use at my home for a generator when the power goes out , especially during the hurricane season in New Orleans.These storage reels makes it easy to wind up the cords when not in use."
4,Hear With Your Eyes,"I have been a big fan of this album for years, the VHS is just as fun. The attempt at humor from Barrymore and Co. is pretty lame (90's slacker speak), but the live/cartoon hybrid music videos are way cool!"
5,A MUST FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGERS,"As a PhD (Cand.) in finance at the University of Quebec at Montreal and finishing a dissertation on the subject of hedge funds, I have found this book extremely important and superbly written from both an academic and a professional point of view. Mr. Brunel brilliantly discusses the new paradigm of Wealth Management along with its process and phases. His chapters on behavioral finance, tax efficiency of portfolio construction, manager selection and implementing a wealth management plan are a first. A must for every portfolio manager!"
5,Rock and Roll with a Melodious Soulful Funk!,"The Brand New Immortals have easily created one of the best albums of the year in Tragic Show. This CD simply rocks! It is funk driven melodic rock that reflects the Pedigree of it's members. David Ryan Harris was formerly the front man for Follow For Now, and more recently produced a solid self titled solo album, while Johnny Colt was the original bass player for the Black Crows. Music lovers are the beneficiaries of their collaboration. This is a fantastic collection of songs that weds David's soulful singing to an intense rock and roll style that creates a quality of music I find missing in mainstream radio today. Let's hope they truly are immortal and keep on making great music for a long, long time."
5,Exerpts of all the books you mean to read,"While the title is acerbic, this is a dynamite book that gives a lot of terrific information on how unbelievably corrupt this administration is."
4,"Entertaining, Informative, Biased","The author does a commendable job of making what could have been a dry story of a financial scheme rather entertaining and very fact-filled. As the General Counsel and corporate Secretary for the fraudsters, the author's claims that he was an unwitting dupe ring hollow, however. This is a fascinating story of thousands of greedy people...some simply greedier than others. At the top of the list was Patrick Bennet, his family, and the indicted co-conspirators. Further down the ""Greedy List"" are the bankers, the accountants, the lawyers, and the ""investors"" who allowed their greed to overcome the fear and common sense. There ain't no free lunch grandma...you taught me that your self. Stop crying and eat your cat food."
1,Go To The Library Instead,"In what could have been one of the most fascinating stories in US history, the reader instead is mired in a convoluted and confusing rendition of the Bennett family's rise to power and position on the backs of trusting investors. As one integrally involved in the unfolding story, Mr. Weisman would appear to have been in a position to illuminate not only the methods and means by which the largest Ponzi scheme in US history took place, but also the very character of the principals involved - a seemingly ordinary family living in a small city in Central New York. Instead the reader is treated to a frequently disjointed and, at times, self-serving story line which has one asking ""how did I get here"" and ""how does this relate to anything?"" As a product of the sixties, it has been a long time since I have seen the word ""kharma"" used with such frequency in print. I wish mine had told me to wait for the paperback edition."
3,Interesting and intuitive system - but unconventional.,"I have Mr Shine's book,Numerology: Your Character and Future Revealed in Numbers. It is intriguing and interesting, showing how the characteristics of numbers interact to form the whole personality of an individual. I take all this ""stuff"" with a grain of salt, but people I have subjected to the system find it as accurate as other subjective personality systems, and valuable for taking an introspective look at oneself for improvement and personal evaluation. I have not used his software program, but have built my own Excel version from the information in the Numerology book that serves very nicely.Some kind of software program is essential to take all the mathematical figuring out of the process."
1,This version is a dissapointment,"About a month or so ago, i bought this song on white lable pre-relase, sometimes, record companies put our various mixes to test the water. The mix i have is probably by thunderpuss but the lable does not say. The mix is not on the CD single, WHY? The white lable mix is INCREDIBLE, but yet its not on the cd, and the mixes on this cd are just plain awfull compared to what i have on vinly. If you can find a white lable promo of Shackles by thunderpuss, grab it, pay extra for it, do what ever you have to and get it, because it blows this cd out of the water. When will the record companies stop trying to feed us FORMULAS and let us have what is truly the better copies of songs? VERY dissapointed in houston."
3,New blues,"3 1/2Brozman can get lost in his own technical quirkiness at times, but the distinctive guitarist certainly seizes every opportunity to turn the familiar into something new- and often succeeds."
5,Great Glucose Meter,"This is probably the best blood glucose meter on the market. It has a lot of nice features, that many people probably aren't aware of, but are useful for diabetics who are trying hard to control their disease. I've owned and used several other brands and this make and model is the best to my knowledge. It has an optional software package that allows one to export all of your stored data into Excel or Word for further editing, plotting, etc. A good, versatile, low-cost meter with a lot of capabilities."
5,One Smart meter,"Handwriting is not easy for me anymore, so when I saw this meter I had to try it. The meter is easy to setup and use. It does what it's supposed to do, and well. I can still use the same strips as my UltraMini."
1,Misleading Product Info,"I bought a One touch ultrasmart glucose monitor for what seemed like a good deal given what was stated on the product description section. The product description section even now states that the product includes the following - OneTouch UltraSmart Blood Glucose Meter, OneTouch Ultra Control Solution, OneTouch UltraSoft Adjustable Blood Sampler, 10 OneTouch UltraSoft Lancets. All I got in the package was the meter. I have solaced myself with - 'you get what you pay for' ! I was mislead by the details provided for the product. Will keep safe distance from this seller !"
3,The history of the Spanish horses in the Americas,"If you like to know the evolution and the history of horses in the Americas, the horses brought by Spanish conquerors that evolved in the Spanish Mustang to the Criollo from Uruguay, Argentina and southern Brazil."
3,I Prefer the Penn Plax Bendable Bubble Wand,"When my first bendable bubble wand broke after about 10 years of use, I purchased this one as a replacement but it didn't produce the volume of bubbles I was used to. So I tried aPenn Plax Bendable Bubble Wall Air Diffuser, 60-Inchand have been very pleased with it. It produced more bubbles from the start than the Marineland bubbler."
5,Does what it is supposed to,"This mattress pad does the job. My son had a couple of diaper leeks, which soaked the sheet and the pad, but the mattress was protected."
1,Shrunk so much that it is useless.,"This shrunk so much on the first wash that I am unable to use it. When trying to stretch it to accommodate the mattress, the cover tore."
4,Works good,It's product is what it says. It is soft and has a nice waterproof layer to it. It works perfect for our cradle and adds a little padding for comfort.
5,A wonderful piece of Miriam's musical career.,"This is absolutely Miriam Makeba's finest live recording. With the excellent musicians Sivuca, Bill Salter and Leopoldo Fleming Jr this album is an important and thrilling piece of her musical history. She captured the audience in a most enchanting way. I know it because I was there at Berns back in 1966 and I am now very happy that this show has been released on CD and DVD, as the first musical video with Miriam Makeba. We all love you Miriam ! Your friend ke Holm in Sweden."
1,Cracking the GRE 2004: 4 Practice Tests on CD-Rom,The Kaplan one is much better. The CD-Rom has the old format of the test for one and then once you sit one test you can't sit it again. Then each answer doesn't have an explanation. A waste of money.
1,Waste of Your Time,"I have been reviewing for the GRE for a few weeks now and after polishing off the Kaplan book, I decided to try the Princeton Review book - what a mistake!This books is not a great way to study and practice for the GRE. First of all, they are still using ""Games and Logic"" sections on their CD-Rom. I called the customer service to ensure that I hadn't received the wrong CD and the person on the phone assured me that I had the most current CD and that there was no way to evaluate the writing portion. You have to wonder why they don't give you the opportunity to at least practice it.Additionally, I was disturbed that I have to take all the practice tests on the CD before I can do the practice questions. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Shouldn't I practice before I take the practice tests?Do yourself a favor and use one of the other books to study for the GRE. This book will only add to your frustration and confusion."
2,strategies for the stupid,"The casual tone of the book, with its rhetorical ""huh's?"" that punctuate truly too many statements, is annoying. A strategy in the quantitative section is to 'plug in' instead of 'breaking down' the equation. They do not thoroughly explain how to solve the problem because they do not sufficiently explain the logic and formulas used.For example, they have a problem where the answer is radical fifty, but the choices are further reduced to 12 radical 2, five radical 2, etc... Instead of showing how one reduces a square-root, they instead tell you to plug in an approximate figure of radical 2: 1 point something or other. This strategy encourages memorizing useless, abstract information, when it would be easier to remember the logical principle. I found that the information the GRE provides on their own website and their PowerPrep CD-Rom was more useful."
2,PLAIN PITIFUL HOW R&B FANS ARE TREATED ON CD,"I am just sick and tired how R&B fans are treated when it comes to great albums not being available on cd. Switch released a total of 5 great albums, with even some of them going at least gold - why are there not separate cd's available for those albums? In some cases a lot of those great R&B albums are only available on cd in Japan, and then you have to fork over high import dollars to get them! There are tons of rock oriented albums that are now on cd that did not sell nowhere near 'gold' status and yet there they are in the cd bins! Some great R&B artists that are not fairly represented on cd include Shotgun, Switch, Rick James, Andre Cymone, Race, Mandre, Raydio, Vernon Burch, The System and many more to name. Someone needs to step up and set the record straight!"
5,20th Century Masters: Millennium Collection,"Liked the selections and what's not to like with these voices, this showmanship and energy? This is a product I am so glad to get.."
4,old days,"Swith CD being back the old days when music was easy to listen to, this is the only CD that you can get from swith. lot of people think that Swith and DeBarge came out at the same time they wrone, swith came out in the late 70's, Swith has two of the older brothers of DeBarge in it group. this a great CD and the only one you will find that has swith in it, good music, it being back the years."
1,Misguided,"I felt slightly duped -- I had no idea this book was an effort of the Jesus Christ for Latter Day Saints sect. When I understood this was the context, I gave it away."
5,Antler Mounting Kit (RED),Great product for the money. Easy to use and looks good on the wall. I recommend this product very highly.
2,Not the greatest,"I bought this to use on a fairly large set of 8 point whitetail antlers. I trimmed away as much skull bone as possible without weakening the antlers, and found that the covered skull cap did not fit. It's styrofoam base does not really allow for any adjustment. This might work on a small set of antlers, but if they used it in the picture they show, they must have custom fit it. I threw away the skull cap, and I made my own cover using a simulated leather fabric and polyester fiber fill to fill it out. I have used different styles of these kits in the past, and I haven't found any that fit really well. I realize they are a generic kit and must fit different types and styles of antlers/horns, it would be better if the skull cap would be more pliable and adjustable."
2,Not what you might expect.,Pros:- gets the job done.Cons:- Not real wood. Not even veneer. Just a piece of particle board with a face sticker made to look like wood grain.Summary:Cheaply constructed. You could make a plaque from real wood using the original as a template if have the ambition.
3,Good value for the money spent,"I chose this type because of cost, it was cheaper. It is OK for what it does, you can't adjust for different sizes or mold the center that covers the skull, but it is great for the price I paid, thank you."
5,Hunting treasure...,"It was just what I was looking for to mount my deer antler's...Great price, and they arrived right on time...Best ever quility, I couldn't have ask for anything better... Georgia"
1,Cheap screws snapped heads off when hand screwing with little pressure,Cheap screwsPress board material- not real wood.brass plate is slightly crooked.Not a very good buy at all
1,Shoddy research!,"I contributed photos to this piece of poorly researched crock of smelly crap. I could barely stomach the first chapters because I read so many inaccuracies, whether about Blondie, Runaways, Go-Go's, X and others. The author had access to people like myself, who know the dates, quotes, locations, etc. She lifted text from other books, which were not correct either. Terrible research! How can anyone pay any attention to something which has easy to verify mistakes? Horrible horrible horrible. I wrote the author, who said she had researchers. Well, they didn't do their job! Total disrespect for the women she purports to admire. HYPOCRITE."
2,A disappointment.,"I was very excited upon finding this book. ""At last, a book for all the women in punk I've admired!"" I thought. Though the author does a fine job in her selection of women for the book, the writing is mediocre, to say the least.The book could have been an interesting dissertation into what it's like to be a minority in an alternative scene. However, the chapters lack any reference to movements within specific time periods. There is no analysis of what the women have done for the punk scene in terms of musicianship and effects of lyrical content; instead, Raha writes as if she is a starstruck fan, only able to spew praise and nothing but.The author should have thought out a better approach towards writing about an impressive list of women in a scene that already has a roster of many underdeveloped and underwritten books to its name. However, the style of Raha's writing and her lack of insight makes the book ultimately fall under said category."
3,Excellent Bible Study ..... but......,"This is an excellent Bible study. It has helped me grow in faith & to better understand God's purpose for my life. My only complaint (the reason I gave it a 3 star rating instead of 5 stars) is that the author's reflections at the end of each week's study give an example of the author's 'trials & sufferings' throughout her life. Unfortunately, these examples are so insignificant most people would not even consider them as such but rather a hiccup in life's journey. It would be better to have left them out all together as women who have had 'real' trial such as miscarriage, death of husband &/or children, chronic illnesses etc find her 'trials' irritating & they distract from God's message. I recommend this Bible study but don't bother reading the author's reflections!!!"
3,Woman's Bible Study,I used the book for a woman's Bible Study at my church on Sundays. It provided a lot of insightful thoughts on the purposes of women in relationship with God.
2,Living Single Soundtrack,"I got this soundtrack just to hear that wonderful ""Living Single"" theme song and to my great disappointment. ~They~ had the nerve not to include it in this soundtrack!!! What the hell is the point of having a soundtrack that based from a show or film? The ""Living Single"" soundtrack in nothing without that theme song!!!"
5,"Anyone have the sheet music to ""I commit to you""",I would like to use this song during my wedding but I need the sheet music. Anyone know where I can find it?Thanks!
2,"Later, much, much later...","Perhaps some time around the time that the sun burns out, that way, you might not have to suffer the incredibly contrived ending. However, simply beginning to read this novel will subject you to contrived situations, characters and coincidences of plot that will probably nauseate you."
4,Keeps you wanting more,"i thought the book was great actually, even though i must say that now or never intrigued me more. i also wanted to note that i read the book under a different title that of no regrets. Anyway i like the authors style of writing and must say that i'll read more of her books when they come out on salethank you"
4,I couldn't stop reading!,"This was the first book by Elizabeth Adler that I have read and I couldn't put the book down. I went to sleep thinking about the book, I awoke at 3am and started reading it again. I had to go to work and couldn't wait to get home to finish it. Yes, even though we knew who the killer was and we knew why, it wasn't enough for me to stop reading. Ms. Adler kept me in suspense, not only with with the killer's plans, but wondering when Dan and Ellie were going to find out they needed each other. Yes, it was predictable, but so enjoyable to find that wonderful chemistry between two people. That's what keeps me coming back to an author. I enjoyed the book very much and look forward to more works by Ms. Adler."
3,Not the best of Elizabeth,"The story of Ellie Duveen will keep you reading all the time, but the books goes out of the story so many times that has parts really boring, it has two mistakes that could be written in other way, for example if a man is a pervert, completely insane, dangerous, and the family doesn't have money to keep him at the mental hospital, the hospital just let him free even if he attacked one guard?Take this book to your next flight and maybe you will enjoy it."
4,Great book,"I loved this book. I, along with everyone else, couldn't put this one down. This was my first Alder book. When I was done, I moved on to another called ""Now or Never"". That is also an excellent book. If you get the chance - read it. These books, I found, that I would read and an hour or 2 would pass, but it only seemed like a short time. I am in process of looking for more by Adler."
5,Just Mad about Mad Daddys,"Fifty Dollar Baby /Music for Men EP. The ""Jerks from Jersey's"" first ep produced by Lux Interior and Poison Ivy from the Cramps plus"" Fifty Dollar Baby"" which is considered the bands 3rd full length release, combined on one CD. Some studio and some live but all high energy punk and roll with fuzzy guitars and thundering (and sometimes fuzzy) groovin bass. Clever humorous lyrics as only singer Stinky Sonuboni (R.I.P.) could deliver. The Mad Daddys were more then just a Jersey bar band. They were legends! Like all pioneers they never got the national attention or credit they deserved. check out such ""Daddy classics as "" Hip Shake""....""I Just killed the President""....""Give It to Me""....."".I'm so Macho"".....Fans of the Cramps, Girl Trouble, or even the Seeds will find space in their CD rack for this disc! The Mad Daddy's wrote a rawk and roll textbook that todays kids need to learn."
5,Sony 4GB,This is very stylish as well as a great product. I love the way that the USB connection slides out; there are no covers to worry about. I love it!
1,Not what you expect,These say they come with a vinyl handle. I just bought 2 different chisels and both came without the vinyl. Only painted blue.
5,Vigilantes deserve national attention,"Bill Mallonee is one of the most talented musicians I have ever witnessed. Having seen him in concert almost 50 times, I would recommend checking out him out live if at all possible. He's a class act and a real witness to the rest of the world without being ""preachy"" like some Christian Artists unfortunately have the reputation of being."
5,good book,I think it was a good book on the subject. It wasn't amazing but it is beneficial to read it. :)
5,Fun and Effective,"While scouring the local libarary for all their fitness tapes I came across ""Now You Can"" by Rita Moreno. Not quite sure what to expect I brought it home and much to my surprise this workout was not only simple but effective. The dance moves are not as complicated as you might expect and Miss Moreno is highly motivating. I'm not sure it will be challenging enough when my fitness level improves but it does the job for now and is a great starting point for anyone just getting started or reintroduced to exercise as I myself am. Unique surprise at the end with what Rita calls a ""cool up"" using 2 scarves is fun if just a little corny. Over-all a good get up and get started workout."
5,From the Author,"Hi everybody! Of course I review my own book with 5 stars but I would love to know what you think. I'm posting a synopsis here because Amazon wasn't given one to put with the book.---My name is John Doe. I've had a difficult life, but it's not about how hard it was, but what I can make from it. I live by my theories of ""Environment"" and ""Fate Equals Love."" I follow the motto that ""Life is what has happened, chance is what is, and dream is what is to be."" Could you ever understand? Would you want to? Take a step inside, test the waters, and see if you can find a purpose. I've lived my life with mental illness caused by years of abuse and neglect. But, in order to survive the bad, I've had to take a step back and see the good, focus on it, and persevere. And here is how I did it...---Hope you enjoy, Benjamin Brown"
3,Let's call this celtic electro-pop,"I listened to the whole album. It's a good album, not exeptional by any means. Where is the ""afro""? I certainly didn't hear enough of an afro influence to warrant the inclusion in the groups name. If you like celtic influenced electro pop then this will truly rock your boat. If not..."
3,Oddly unmelodious,"This album is full of sound and rythm, but lacks melody to stand out. Songs are uniform and very repetitive (musical transitions are very scarse along the songs). I can think of a few good moments, but not much. Putting nice sounds together is not enough for me. Actually, only the guest artists really cought my attention."
2,Afro Celt Sound System Has Become Too Formulaic,"I really enjoyed Afro Celt Sound System Volumes 1 and 2, but found Volume 3 too predictable and ""New Age"" sounding. Where there used to be an edge to their music, it now sounds canned. I hope with Volume 4 this group will put more effort into producing a quality CD."
5,Another gem,"Consistently interesting if not always successful, this third outing sees Afro Celt Sound System continue to make a wholly original contribution to popular music. They are at their best when giving African rhythms a lush electronic treatment (as in the title track), and least successful when fusing them with overtly Celtic instrumentation to produce a kind of Riverdance Trance (e.g. 'Colossus'). Vocally much stronger than their previous efforts, this album impresses with star turns from Robert Plant and especially Peter Gabriel. But it is the utterly peerless Iarla O'Lionaird who will really have your spine tingling - even on the radio-friendly 'Persistence Of Memory' and 'When You're Falling' (backing up PG). Vocally, this man is a god."
5,Pulchritudinous!!!,"I am not one to write reviews or write anything for that matter, but this album gets that fist sized muscle in my chest beating a lot faster. It makes me appreciative of music, and its capacity to unite an increasingly complex planet. It is jam packed with sounds from afar...I am on my third spin and cannot believe how much is going on. WOW! Afro-Celt Sound System has hit the nail on the head with this one! Kudos!! Buy this album for your sanity!"
5,"""from start to finish...pure energy blends originality!""","The title ~ ""Further In Time"", this third volume of the already successful ""Sound Magic Volume One"" and ""Volume Two-Release"", is appropriate. What almost seems natural...blending Western Africa and Ireland into one entity, is pure energetic enjoyment...outstanding instrumentals and vocals, mixed with ""playful talent"". This group just keeps getting better and better...sit back, spin this CD...and enjoy your international holiday...wherever you are!Hats off to ~ Simon Emmerson, James McNally and Martin Russell (producers) and Real World Music...impressive arrangements, performances blends the past with todays sound...closing the generation gap forever!Total Time: 70:42 on 12 Tracks ~ Real World Records 10184 ~ (2001)"
2,CD purchase,"Unfortunately I purchased this CD based on one cut that I heard on the radio. I found that this was the only piece I liked, the rest of the album was not as good. I was not familiar with the group. This taught me a lesson to listen to other cuts before purchasing music by a group I have not heard in the past.Volume 3: Further in Time"
5,A completely new experience!,"I have never heard anything like this album before. I love 80's dance music and New Age relaxation music, and this album is not like either, but is unique in every way. This is the first album I have bought of this type. I have not heard volume 1 or 2. There are so many varieties of instuments that are full of spirt and life. The grooves are hypnotic and intense. I found myself dancing all around the house to the powerful lively african beats. I love this album so much! This is the type of album you will want to hear over and over again and never tire of. It is a great CD for those long drives, a fantastic dance CD, and a truely unique sound. This Album is an excellent and innovative peice of artwork. Buy it and you will not be dissapointed, no matter what tastes of music you prefer."
5,Unique and Stellar.,"This showed up under Amazon.com's recommendations for me, so I listend to the samples of the tracks, went to the band website, and had to go out and buy it locally because it just impressed me that much. If you're into a world sound, celtic, afro, or Peter Gabriel, this album is worth checking out. The sound is absolutely unique. And the Peter Gabriel track by itself is worth buying this album over. It's also worth noting that you can listen to the tracks in their entirety on the band official website. And that's what sealed it for me with this CD. Take a listen. Make a decision."
5,Leprecoon,"If you enjoy ambient music and an ethereal trip into higher consciousness, this album is for you. I originally just bought it because I am a Peter Gabriel fan. I was not disappointed. Two popular music styles of very different ethnic origins have taken the world by storm; Irish and African. The marriage of these two is what Afro Celt accomplishes in a style often referred to ""Leprecoon."" Two countries rich in myths and legends are represented in a Leprecoon style the whole world will enjoy."
5,Great book! Exiting for all kids but harder for ages 3 to 6,I loved this book. I am an eight year old and still love this book. This book is about a little girl who always gets into trouble. She does things and then blames them on someone else. People that are ennocent are getting into trouble. Read the book to find out more!
3,"A sleek improvement on the T609, but... where's microSD?","I held back from buying a Samsung T609, knowing that this phone would soon be released. The functions are almost identical, and the new form doesn't disappoint - sleek, thin, yet feels sturdy and works great. However, they took out the microSD memory expansion slot! Why the tradeoff, Samsung? Beware if you're looking to use its MP3 functionality or to make good use of its 1.3MP camera: with only its 21MB of internal memory at your disposal, it won't hold much."
4,Rurouni Kenshin Vol. 1,"This was the very first Manga book I have bought and I must admit that I was very happy with my purchase. I ended up purchasing Vol 1&2 at the same time. The storyline and characters both grabbed me and forced me to read through both of the books in a matter of two and a half hours. Even though I've read the books I still believe I will read through them many more times in the future. Anyhow, if you like anime and manga I really think you should check out Nobuhiro Watsuki's work as he has done an extremely good job putting this series together."
4,Not bad Viz.,"Now I'm, not a big fan of Viz and I'm a huge fan of Rurouni Kenshin. So when I heard Viz has aquired rights to publish translated Kenshin manga here in the USA, My eyes rolled into the back of my head as I silently cursed the gods. I'm writing this to take back that curse because Viz has done a comendable job getting this series translated and brought to the USA. Aside from my only complaint which is what they did to the cover, I think this is fine. The translations are on mark, Kenshin still say's ""oro?"" and It's in Right to left format, The correct and only way manga should be read in my opinion.And in case anyone is wondering what the manga covers, if you've seen the anime, it covers episodes 1 and ends right near the end of 4 I believe. So check it out. You wont regret it."
5,Actually...,"""Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story"" IS the translated subtitle for ""Meiji Kenkaku Romantan."" ^_^;"
4,The legendary Battosai,"My grandma bought me this manga, I have seen the anime series on Cartoon Network before but I didn't get too interested into it. One of my friends, who is also into manga told me that this series is better than i though and that the manga is better. My grandma bought and sent me the book. So I read it, at the first few chapters I liked everything, then I found that the story was going downhill. Like others have commented, it is only the first volume, the characters do have personality, although i found one of them really annoying. It is only the first volume after all and some people did say that things do get better later so I do recommend it if you like action, romance(kind of..) and well great characters!"
5,The best fiction created from history,"The storyline is brilliant! With each episode you see & read the more hooked you become. It is a perfect blend of action and romance. The story of Kenshin's sworn atonement is wonderfully written, the way he fights without killing another is a total spectical especially since he was the infamous Hitokiri Battousai. The way this story is based on true history of the Meji era in Japan mix with a fictional ""legend"" of a warrior who seeks atonement for what he has done in his past. I recommend this series to anyone who loves action stories and history."
5,Connie,I have been using this product for several years. It is a great product. Will not cure acid reflux but will help in the journey. Diet change is what will cure it. I have been trying to get off the acid reflux medicine for years. Have greatly reduced my need for the medication and I believe this product has helped that and helps with healing the stomach lining. I would highly recommend it.
3,Academic but boring,"My students enjoy hearing about the personal lives of people in psychology. It helps them to recall the theories. This was a well done book, but not what I had hoped. There was almost no personal information. One short paragraph about Jung? And I missed putting the person into his/her place in time. The anti-semitic, Victorian era for Freud and so on. (This information helps the student to see the theorist in a context). I also thought short shrift was given to Piaget. One sentence... Overall? A dissapointment."
5,Good Vitamins at a Good Price,I have been searching for a high quality Vitamin D supplement at a good price and this is it!
5,Take daily,"I take this vitamin D3 daily. Package arrived a day early, which was nice. Good price for this size bottle."
2,Satisfied BUT.,Excellent item but the door broke almost instantly. Will still go on phone but falls off constantly.
2,"Wonderful Battery, Terrible Plastic Door","The battery works beautifully and stays charged for days compared to the old (standard) battery I replaced, which would often die during the day. It is larger and sticks out the back of the phone more than the standard battery, so be aware of that, and that's why they provide the plastic battery door with it.However, the cheap plastic battery door is just that: cheap. Mine arrived with one of the two insert tabs already broken, although it doesn't seem like it would have fit securely onto the phone even if it had been intact. Don't expect much from this door, you might have to tape it onto the phone to keep it secure like I did. I actually purchased an additional standard battery along with this extended battery, and I've given up using this extended battery and am now using the new standard battery because I can't stand having this cheap door taped onto the phone any longer. Had the battery door functioned well, I would have given this product 5 stars."
4,How to fix the battery cover problem,"Hi,Like others, I found that the battery cover didn't fit properly. I found that with the battery removed from the phone, the cover fit Ok (although not perfect). With the battery in the phone, the cover fit poorly and was difficult to install yet came off far too easily.The replacement battery has a black plastic jacket on the bottom side. The root cause for the poor fit is the additional material that this plastic jacket adds which causes the battery to sit up too high and lopsided (the side with the contacts sits lowest).I sanded this plastic jacket on the bottom of the battery using 200 grit sand paper and removed a thin layer of material, mostly on the side opposite from the contacts. This levelled out the battery and also lowered it within the battery compartment.I'm happy to report that the battery cover is now much easier to install and also is less apt to fall off.Hope this helps someone..."
1,"It might just be me, but...",I can't think of anything positive. Case doesn't even approach looking like it would stay on. Hard to tell if the battery is of high quality because the case constantly falls off. I would suggest going with the standard sized replacement battery or another version with a different case.
5,plenty power,"ordered two to replace the thin one that came with the phone. now there is no need to change the battery in the middle of the day when doing so without being plugged in may reset the clock to 2005. even though the thicker battery means the phone case cannot be snapped, the phone now fits the case so snugly that it cannot fall out by just inverting the case. wish i would have had THIS battery all along. AND the backup battery is still awaiting its first use. perfect!"
1,Excesive shipping form this seller !!!,"I bought 6 batteries formm this seller, even though I bought 6 items they charge me individual shippment but they send it in the same packege!!! abusive seller!!!"
5,fastest delivery,first of all I expected the battery to come in a few weeks and it was at my door at the end of the week. I was very happy and the product did the job
4,"Good extended Door, but...","Here's the deal I bought this extended battery with the idea of getting more talk time, I don't think I am, I think I am getting about the same amount of time with the smaller thinner original battery. I would recommend this as an extra battery but not an extended battery. The extended silver door does not fall off so this is a plus and very much should be noted. My advice is though if you need more talk time go directly to the source of the maker of your original battery that came with the phone. It's bound to be more expensive but you get what you pay for."
4,Lithium-Ion Batter with Silver Door,"The battery works very well. However, the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily."
3,"Big Battery = More Minutes, Not Longer Lifespan","This battery did what I bought it for...extend the amount of time I could use my phone without recharging. It just didn't do it for as long as I thought or hoped it would.My rough guess is it at least doubled my talk time when new; at the expense of making a what was already a brick into a cinder block. With this battery on my phone, it looked and felt huge. For the size, it seems that it should have given even more time in call.After about a year the drop off in performance was very noticeable, to the point that the battery would need recharging daily...about the same as the normal one it replaced.In summary, it does what it says, is huge, and should be considered an annual expense if you use it a lot.Also, price a new case...it's doubtful a snug one will expand enough to accommodate the increase in size."
2,The description was misleading,"On the specs it said the charm was 1 inch long... It however was not, with the oval clasp which was almost a third of the size of the horn it barely made one inch. It is also very light... I was under the impression that it was solid gold... It however was hollow, and you could see the seams on the side... Also, right after the purchase, I went online because I wanted to review it and it was $10.00 cheaper... So I contacted Amazon for a sales adjustment, and they said they couldn't because I got ""the last of the old shipment, now there was a new shipment..."" So they gave me an $8.00 credit to use some where on their site. I didn't waste the time in returning because it was a Christmas present and if I would have done that there's no way I would have gotten my refund and a new charm by the time Christmas rolled around. Overall, I'm disappointed in the quality."
5,Fabulous wriitng and edge of your seat adventure,"Excellent thriller. Incredible in-depth writing. You feel that you have met these characters and have been on this wall, experiencing the intense life and death adventure. This is Jeff Long's best book to date. It grips you from the first page. Can't wait to see it in a movie."
3,This Jeff Long effort is not what I expected.,"I started reading Jeff Long with ""Descent"". I thoroughly enjoyed it and sought out other works by him.""The Wall"" was my second book by Jeff. I'm still not sure if I liked it. I don't want to spoil it, but it was too open ended in my opinion. Ends were left loose. Things were left unexplained. It was an extremely well written and enjoyable novel, until the last 30 pages. Then things got weird. I need a sequel Jeff!"
4,A climber's book,"Jeff Long is noted for writing adventure stories that all have a scary aspect to them, but not this one. Still, it is a well written story about one main character, Hugh, who has lost his wife to a disappearance in the desert and wants to rekindle his youth with one last climb of El Capitan. He is a tortured soul and even before he sets out to climb the mountain with his life long friend, Lewis, a women climber falls off the mountain, literally at his feet. This starts off a chain of events that ends up having him assist in trying to rescue the girls companions.This mis when things really start to go wrong for all concerned. Since Long is a climber, he knows all the correct mountaineering jargon, equipment and climbing moves. It is a sory that starts out slow, but goes faster and faster, until the end comes with a shattering twist. Hey, I never saw that coming."
2,LONG IS TOO LONG,"THE WALL is one of those stories you expect from writers like Ernest Hemingway as man faces off with the forces of nature. Jeff Long's paean is way toooo long; it would have been better as a short story. It seems like it takes forever for anything to happen and the characters while constructed nicely are not that likeable or involving. Perhaps as a movie, it might be more entertaining to watch than read all the technical terms and flashback diversions. As it is, though, THE WALL is just not that exciting, and its ending, though surprising, seems anticlimactic."
4,Always a pleasure to read Jeff Long,I began reading Jeff Long's work years ago beginning with The Ascent. Every book since then has been a true pleasure to read. As a climber/outdoorsman I appreciate the insight and the gritty reality that only someone who practices what they preach can bring to their storytelling. The Wall kept me reading into the wee hours with nervous anticipation. It did not disappoint.
3,Soo close to being good . . . but the ending,"I was totally sucked in by this book--the ambiguous supernatural elements, the main character you feel like you know, the pacing--it's really pretty good. The characters are well-developed and intriguing. There are really only 2 problems: a lot of technical jargon about climbing (which if you are a climber I'm sure you would totally love but sometimes presented an obstacle to the uninformed in visualizing the action)--but I could overlook that because this is, after all, a story about climbing. Unfortunately the ""shocker"" ending I would call a complete disappointment. Sometimes going for too much shock ruins what was up to that point a good story."
2,Disappointing,"After reading Descent, The Reckoning & Year Zero I was excited to read another of Jeff Long's books. This one I got on CD so that my husband & I could listen on a long trip. Unfortunately this did not compare to his other books. It was boring in parts - I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. The ending was a huge disappointment. Definitely not up to Jeff Long's standards."
2,crappy ending ruins the book experience,"the last sentences of this review have some minors spoilers.first off, im suprised people actually liked this book. i stayed up all night reading it. and i get to the end. and it was one of the biggest letdowns ive had reading a book. jeff long's other books are amazing, but in this one he brings up all these ideas of ghosts, or a supernatural power on the mountain and he doesnt even explore it. and the ending didnt really make any sense. a corpse walks away? and somehow cuba knew about his past? also as soon as he told the desert story i knew he left her in the desert. it was pretty obvious. sorry im rambling. basically the story took a lot of cool ideas and built them up to nothing. you throw yourself into the book hoping it will pay off in the end and you are left with an empty feeling. that pretty much sums up the book.check out the descent, year zero, and the reckoning in that order if you want to read some awesome jeff long books."
4,Jeff Long does it again!!!,"One thing Jeff Long knows how to do is develop a setting by creating a chilling atmosphere even before anything really strange happens. He does this well in The Wall as well as in his previous novel The Reckoning. Through the story you have this feeling of foreboding and you know something sinister is going to happen. Strange things happen throughout, but it does not really hit you until near the end when all is revealed.Another thing I liked is how Long handled the details of Climbing. He did not go into long tutorials on the tools and methods mentioned in the story. But for those not familiar with climbing (like me) it will take some imagination or investigation to understand some of the concepts put forth but that is fine. It promotes interest in a new topic for some but does not bog down readers who are familiar with the topics presented while letting the story flow uninterrupted."
5,Great Book,Two aging climbers trying to recapture their youth. Exciting climbing action making one wonder why anyone would do it. The quirky subplot and ending slams you like an avalanche. Sometimes the pace is a little excruciating but all in all I highly recommend this book!
2,"Unless you love endless climbing descriptions: Slow , plodding, dull. Terrible ending.","I'm not sure where all these 5 stars reviews are coming from. I read this book on a plane and found myself skimming/skipping large chunks of the book. I have climbed. But I'm not a fanatic, and I'm certianly not an expert by any means. Maybe if you're a climbing addict and have climbed El Cap yourself, you'd love all the ad nauseum climbing description which is a majority of the book. I frankly found it zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Like get on with the plot/story already! You're boring me!!! Also, sometimes I felt I had no idea visually what was being describing re: their environment when they finally find Cuba 3/4 through the book...which by the way, was when it finally started to pick up and get interesting. All that was then dashed by the absolutely crappy ending which I felt was unbelievable, stupid, and a little bit out of nowhere. I threw the book in the trash. I really should give it a 1."
2,Disappointing,"Jeff Long is one of my favorite living writers. That said, this book doesn't live up to what he has done before. ""The Descent"" is one of my all time favorites and ""Year Zero"" is right behind it. In this new book Jeff steps back from the big themes he explored previously and goes back to the smaller, more condensed types he did before. This is fine, but the entire book devolves into cheesy mysticism that he touches on in his other books, but at least used to a more satisfying effect in the part. His descriptions of the struggles of climbing are vivid and gripping and his prose makes me wish I was physically capable of such heroic feats, but the ending is a disappointing slap that negates all that came before."
3,for beginners only/mainly,"That it's on ""Irwin Trader's Edge"" is annoying indeed.Okay, this book is for starting traders. And for beginners this book isn't all that bad - I even say it's quite okay, informative.However if you've been trading for more than ump years already and still need advice on decision-making, stay away from this book. You'll find books by Robert C Miner or Brett N Steenbarger helpful.If you still want to spend that much money on a book with charts and patterns, buy the Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns by Thomas N Bulkowski instead. Lots of positive ratings and reviews."
5,great!,I got this to check my baby's temperature when he was less than 1 because he would not sit still for the ear thermometer. My mom had these when I was growing up and I love using them.
3,Summer infant forehead thermometer,"They won't stay put after a time or two. It has a sticky side so it supposed to stick right? Well good idea, but in real life there is sweat, oil ... and it's not precise but what can you expect for the money."
2,Save your money,"I thought I would try because of the price, but it wasn't worth it. It doesn't give accurate readings and the ranges are very broad. I am a first time parent and wouldn't recommend this at all."
3,good idea,I HAVEN'T USED IT THAT OFTEN BUT IT IS A GOOD CONCEPT. I LIKE THE STRIP YOU CAN STICK ON THEIR FOREHEAD OVERNIGHT TO MONITOR. I HAVE A FOREHEAD SCAN THERMOMETER AND I USE THAT MORE.
2,"Lots of Stuff, Lots of Errors","I am disappointed at the amount of errors in the text and in figures here. If I didn't have a basic understanding of most of this, I would be incredibly frustrated. Proper names are misspelled, somehow the word ""Conservation"" got switched to ""conversation,"" and figures, meant to teach are out and out wrong. I didn't look at the Princeton book, but if I had the time, I would."
4,Great review,"I haven't taken the test yet; however, I have already received my bachelor's degree in psychology. This book sums up the four years of psych. classes I took. It does miss some things, but it would be impossible to cover everything you learn in college. It is a great review nonetheless. I would not recommend it for anyone who has not already had all of the main subjects in psychology. It is simply a review, not a learning tool. There are mini tests after each section, which are nice. It is a lot of reading, so be prepared to start studying a couple of months before the test."
4,Robert Altman Directed This Episode,"This episode was directed by the now well-known film director Robert Altman (M*A*S*H, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Cookie's Fortune, Nashville, 3 Women, Gingerbread Man, The Player, Short Cuts, The Long Goodbye, Fool For Love, Ready To Wear, and others).This episode stars Stella Stevens as a young deaf mute who finds new hope through the goodwill of Little Joe, and originally aired in April 1961."
1,None,"if you are looking for a book with smart riddles that you can memorise and tell your friends, i'm afraid this is the wrong book. :("
5,Cute,"This is a cute little book full of phrases that a dad would say. This has everything from ""Go ask your mother"" to ""pull my finger."" This book is exactly what the title says it is. Very cute!!"
1,Fatal Error,"I cannot install this on my computer because of a fatal error, something about an invalid digital signature. I'm going to try and return this to the B&M; store I bought it at, but who knows if they'll take it back. If not, then I'll have to call my CC company. Boy, I've heard of and played games that were buggy upon release, but not even being able to install it?!? I hope someone from LA is fixing this problem or calling their distributors to accept returns.If you look at the LA Forums, there are some fixes that have been posted, but it's hard to know which ones actually work. Also, it requires some computer know how on downloading and tinkering with files. If you would rather avoid this, then avoid this game. (BTW, I'm not some computer noob, just someone who thinks a game should be able to be played out of the box.)"
4,"pretty good, but not the best","this game is pretty good when you start playing until you get to about the middle of the bounty hunter part, and get one of the ghosts(takes a long time). then you have to get about 60 gold bricks to get to Lego City. then it gets kind of boring. I've had it for like 2 1/2 years, I haven't even got to Lego City yet!"
4,Fun for father and son,The type of game which makes you work together in two player mode and is alot of fun with a challenge
4,Really cool game,"First of all this game is great for two players and has much more to it than the first Lego StarWars. New features such as riding in vehicles such AT-ST's and Speeders. There is new feature that allows you to create your character and it is awesome! the only problem is it is a tiny bit limiting as whatyou can use. Studs are allot easier to aquire than the first game and bonuses are cheaper. the real object of the entire game is to collect gold bricks by either attaining a true jedis status, collecting minikits, and going on bounty hunter missions. there are 99 to collect and after you pass 50 or so each gold brick it'll give you 100,000 studs. there are more story mode missions and if you have a pc version of both Lego StarWars games you bring character from the first to the second. i thank you for reading this review and i highly recomend this game to people you like playing multipalayer."
4,great fun,i like the game. its pretty close to the movie. the main thing i wish they had was a save feature. you can only save if you finished the chapter.for someone doing it in short periods of time it can get frustrating doing the same thing over again before getting to where you were the last time and having to quit before you got to the end of the chapter. otherwize kids and adult fans of SW would get a kick out of this game!
4,A must have. . .,"If you are a big Star Wars fan, this game is a must have. I always wanted a game on the PC that I could play the original trilogy. This game is loads of fun, even without graphic violence. The only thing I don't like is that I don't have control of the camera angle, and that can get a little annoying. However, it is worth buying and fun for the whole family."
4,Speechless,"Our 5 year old son has played this video game at his friend's homes, but we were apprehensive about purchasing it for a 5 year old. We caved and bought it for Christmas - he's still speechless when people ask him what Santa gave him for Christmas and he absolutely loves the game. We have the Windows version, which our sons have figured out how to maneuver, but it is complicated - you have to use letters, shift keys, etc to move the players around. They sometimes get frustrated when they can't move a certain figure, but we can usually figure it out.There is a lot of shooting, light sabors, etc, but they are lego figures, so it does not appear as violent. There are 99 levels to the game and so far, they've completed the first three. It's quite a fun challenge."
4,Great fun for the Star Wars fans,"I got this for my eight year old son and he loves it. Most games he can master in a matter of minutes. This game has over 29 levels. It will take him months before he gets bored with it. I like it too because the game is made up of the Star Wars characters that I love when I was a kid. With the 2 player action, we both can play."
3,Sloppy release for a great game,My son has had a great time with the new version of the Lego Star Wars game. It is challenging and provides many new twists. Installing this game was a serious challenge and the reason for the lower rating. To get it to work I had to install a massive software patch downloaded from the manufacturer. There are numerous Web sites providing help for the problem that I encountered and other technical problems associated with this release.
1,PC Lego StarWars 2,"I purchase this game on the PC because I prefer to use a mouse and keyboard interface. I found the experance very frustrating trying to move around or do anything in the game, very litte instuction in the manual and the choice of buttons you can use in the change options did not help at all. I purchased a gamepad and tried again and it was even worse. There appears to be no way to change your point of view and you wind up having to move toward the camera without seeing where you are going. I gave up and uninstalled the game. Waste of money but at least it was only a $20 lesson never to buy these types of games on the pc."
1,Lousy Program,"This program would probably be fun to play if you can get it loaded. I spent 6 hours with four calls to Lucasarts Support and finally gave up trying to load it on a PENTIUM III, with 512 ram. I am NOT a NOVICE user and have had PC's since 1982. On my last call, the suppor person told me that you must have Administrator access to PLAY this game. Who wants to open their computer to the wiles of a 5-7 year old?After giving my grandson this access, and finally loading the game...it locked up! No amount of re-booting, reloading, removing, etc. was successful in letting us play. THIS IS MY LAST LUCAS ARTS game. I suggest you look to other brands."
1,How do I play this game???,"The game lacks an in-game tutorial (like those in the Elder Scroll series, for example,) which is sorely needed for old fogies like me who cut our teeth on role-playing, real-time strategy, and (a few PC-type) first-person shooters (think Diablo.) The tutorial(?) included makes references to buttons that either are not apparent (gamepad, perhaps?) I can't seem to control the character; the suggestions for personalizing are non-intuitive; in short, I'm totally at a loss. The manual is less than helpful. BTW, lest you think I'm a total idiot: I'm a former Mensa member."
3,"Fun gameplay, but defective product","The game is very fun, but not challenging. Once I actually got the game working it was great! The problem is some digital rights management trick intended to prevent copying... which apparently doesn't even work because there are illegal copies all over the place...Anyway, even though I own a perfectly legal copy that I got through Amazon, the game wouldn't install correctly. As a legitimate owner of the game, I shouldn't have to go through that! And by the way, I don't know about anyone else out there, but my CDs and DVDs get scratched up after a while, sometimes to the point that they are unusable. It's my copy, I bought it, so why shouldn't I be able to make a backup copy for my own use? Plus, what they're doing doesn't even stop illegitimate copying!No more LucasArts products for me!"
2,Great game spoiled by lack of basic Save feature,"This is a good game which my 5-year old son finds absolutely compelling. BUT, why on earth don't they allow you to save the game as you go through? The box says that it is suitable for people of 3+ years but what the programmers have forgotten is that children take time to get through games like this. Not being able to save the game means that we have had to leave the PC on since Christmas so that we don't lose our progress. What a shame these programmers don't live in the real world!"
4,Incredible Star Wars Game!,"This is one of the best games I've played! I bought this product and it's just like the original trilogy movies! Collecting the gold bricks is the object, and red bricks help you win. It is harder than Lego Star Wars 1, but it has way more features: episode bonuses, bounty hunter missions, and you can build objects with the force AND your player's hands! The driving levels are different, though the regular levels are excatly like the first game. There are 18 levels and great graphics. There are realistic noises and the players do special actions when you press different buttons. The Mos Eisley Cantina is the home place. It is full of secrets! The controls are easy. I recommend this for ages 8-whatever!"
3,I guess I was expecting more.,"It's been a while since I've seen a really good serial killer movie on par with SE7EN or Silence of the Lambs. It's a tricky genre to get right, and Killer Gene manages to get it about three-quarters right with interesting characters and an intriguing motivation for the action. But something about the plotting and the artificiality of ""science"" introduced into the story prevents ""Gene"" from joining the upper ranks. A diverting enough film, certainly more intelligent and engaging than, say, Untraceable, but in the words of Maxwell Smart, it missed it by ""that much."""
2,Another one for the 'torture somebody' category,"Oh, dear. And I do so like Selma Blair. She plays an obsessed, revengeful murderer with a dispassionate coldness that makes her deranged killer believable (her eyes hold a steady gaze and barely blink, her face reveals determination but not pleasure). However, her stooping to take this role is not worth the rent payment. I guessed what lurked beneath Stellan Skarsgard's character after 30 minutes, and Ashley Walter's detective is -- as with so many female detective characters -- relegated to playing catch-up and proving her worth. The serial violence is gory but not to the level of creepy. Suffice it to say, this movie is for people who just can't get enough portrayals of torture and suffering."
1,Too shaky to watch,"Movie made with a hand-held camera. Causes instant nausea and headache. What's with that, really? My cheap Sony camcorder has Anti-Shake feature and could film it better. I can't watch shaky movies and give them the lowest rating possible.Unless shaky flicks are your thing, just forget it."
4,"""Who Do You Love?""...","THE KILLING GENE is a bleak thriller filled w/ revenge, torture, and murder. A past crime has caused its victim to exact vengeance in a most grisly, yet intriguing manner. Stellan Skarsgard and Melissa George play the cops who must solve the case before the killer finishes this grim business. Selma Blair (HELLBOY 1 and 2) is chilling in her cold, almost dead portrayal of the woman out for revenge and release. She is superb in this role. Skarsgard and George are also good, as are the rest of the cast. If you enjoyed the SAW or HOSTEL films, or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SE7EN, or tv's WIRE IN THE BLOOD, then GENE should satisfy..."
3,Being Generous With the 3rd Star,"The movie does make you think a little. There were some twists that I didn't see coming. The script could have been better though. There were just so many holes. For example, early in the movie, so I am not giving anything away, a thug gets released from the killer. The killer doesn't hide from the victims, so this thug knows who the killer is. Instead of going to get revenge with his gang, he just hangs himself. That didn't make sense to me.The acting was so-so by everyone in the film. Nobody's performance stands out to me.I only got it because Tom Hardy was in it, but I found he didn't have a very decent role."
2,"Extremely repetitive, but could be useful to some people","This is one of those books that seems to repeat the same things over and over and over.If you're new to RSI, could be a very good way to learn how RSI differs from carpal tunnel, and many of the ways that you can begin to heal. However they really could've made the book about half the length.The main points that I did take away from the book is the importance of reducing how much I type overall. How did I do that? I found a voice to text program, which I'm actually using to write this review without typing. I would definitely say that your money is better spent buying a product such as Dragon naturally speaking version 11, and avoiding the RSI in the first place."
2,No substitute for medical evaluation,"I ordered this book when I was having pain in my hands when working on the computer as part of my daily work. It was not very useful. Ultimately, I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, a condition that has nothing to do with repetitive motion. I highly recommend that anyone experiencing such symptoms get the condition fully evaluated by a medical doctor."
5,A must buy for any computer professional,"Buying this book has been a life changing event. I still remember being drained both physically and mentally from RSI, as any RSI sufferer will tell you. I almost lost hope and was painfully seeing my software career coming to an end and then I bought this book. It's an eye opener that brings you a ray of hope about a possible recovery. And, that's what happened to me after I read this book and eventually got treated by Suparna 4 months ago. All thanks to her, I am now typing this review without a pain and as an RSI survivor."
2,Not the real cure...,"This book makes a strong attempt to properly diagnose the many RSI-related injuries however if you want to get the real diagnosis and cure yourself of RSI in a very short period of time like thousands of others have, read ""The Mindbody Prescription"" by John Sarno. It is available on Amazon. Just read the reviews for it."
5,Olevia 542i HDTV,"Actually this is my third Olevia. I own a 27"", 37"" and now a 42"". All three are a great value. The set-up was easy, the picture very sharp w/ my Direct TV. I have no idea of off-air quality. I wasn't real crazy on how the OSD worked, but I got used to it. Sure, there are other sets that have a better picture, colors, controls, but also at twice the price. The way I view buying TV's these days is why spend a lot of money on technology that will be out of date within a year. Unless you've got money to burn, Olevia deserves a close look."
1,TV dosn't last,"Bought this TV last x-mas. Worked well until September. Then we started to notice that the screen had burn in. black lines on the sides of the full screen pictures. Called for warranty service and was told that it would be replaced with in 7-9 days. At 10 days I called and was told it would be replaced 'next week' this has gone on for over a month now. I am in the process of fighting for a full refund at this point. Do not waste your money! Get a TV that may cost a bit more, but will serve you well for years(not just months).It took me 5 calls and 3 messages to get to speak to a CS manager. Finally spoke to VP of CS. They offered me a cheaper TV to replace the 542i. He said they shut down all their operations to fix business problems. Now I'm trying to get my money to buy a quality TV from a reputable company!"
1,worst company ever,if you like having a tv that breaks down all the time.this the tv for you. and when you call costumer service and have a ghetto person say to you..wha cha want..this the company for you.if you like buying a tv that breaks down in 6 months..have it replaced and the replacement tv breaks in 6 months too..this is the tv for you.get the word out..syntex olivia is the worst company in america
4,Interesting reading,"As an owner of several Basset Hounds, I can say that I enjoyed this book very much. Mr. Borland truly captured the essence of the quirky basset personality.I must point out that this book disturbed me quite a bit. The dog was allowed to roam freely, and was put in great danger many times. Basset hounds (as well as other dogs) should not be permitted to roam the countryside at will."
2,Not wholesome family entertainment,"The disregard for the lives of animals in this film was shocking. From shooting wolves to abandoning a pet to die (though later resolved), this is not wholesome family entertainment. The most interesting parts are simply the documentary clips of nomadic life."
1,"Badly packaged, high defect rate.","I'll never know how long-lasting these Delkin disks really are, because I ended up discarding most of them. Several were defective outright and didn't burn properly because of problems such as a pitted surface. The wallet concept was also very bad for unrecorded media, since it meant the discs already had too much dust on the surface, coming right out of the package. I tried blowing them off with canned air, but that didn't always get rid of everything. Sure enough, despite my best efforts, I ended up mostly with flawed dye layers. Even really cheap media perform better than this. If there weren't so many defective discs in the two Delkin wallet packages I purchased, I might have considered buying a spindle of blank Delkin discs in the future. Above all, this wallet thing is a dog. Avoid at all costs."
5,"Cute Book, Great Series!","My son is 9 years old and hates chapter books, he would much rather be reading non-fiction. When I found the Chet Gecko series at the store, I took a chance and bought the first book. At first my son refused to read it, but after reading the first two chapters aloud as a bedtime story, he was hooked. He has since read all of the Chet Gecko novels and loves each and every one. I have read most of them to my students, (I teach reading recovery in a middle school)and they have always been a huge hit. While he may not be reading Chaucer, I am very happy to see him reading chapter books and enjoying himself. My six year old daughter also loves having the books read to her. I would recommend the Chet Gecko to any child, boy or girl, as a great introduction to mystery novels, detective stories, and bad puns."
5,great little purse,"I use my half-pint as a purse during the day when I'm at school or out with my son. It has a key holder in the front pocket and just enough room for my wallet, mt daily planner, a water bottle and whatever else I need to carry with me. Plus, you can throw it in the washing machine and dryer when it gets dirty.I get tons of compliments on this little bag."
4,"Cute, basic, well made -- just what I was looking for","I bought this for my pre-schooler. The school required a bag with no wheels. I also wanted a bag that was a little unique that didn't have cartoon characters on it. This bag is the perfect size for my little girl (she's almost 4) and she'll be able to use this bag for several more years as the straps are adjustable. This could even be used by an adult for a small daypack.The inside is roomy enough to fit a change of clothes, small books, lunch and papers. Or for a traveling adult -- some snacks, wallet, guidebook, thin jacket and travel umbrella. My only complaint would be that the inside isn't quite big enough to fit an average size piece of paper so art projects get a bit bent -- not a huge deal!"
4,Great esp. for the price.,I bought this set for a good friend of mine who was having a little girl - and she LOVES IT!! The set is very nice - with applique butterflies etc..and the characters on the blanket are plush. It's a very delicate pink color which is also nice. I had to do quite a bit of searching on here to find this - and I'm glad I got the last one! Great set - for a great price!
4,It makes me look classy!,"Thank you for the fast shipping.I like the watch every much. The leather straps look better than I thought. I know now I made the right decision to buy this one after a long research.Well, I have a question. What are Movt: Philippines and Strap: China? It was made in Philippines?"
1,"Did not work after just 8 days, light went out and so did the time!","After just 8 days, the light did not work and the watch lost time! In the past, I have had wonderful success with Timex watches, but they don't make them like they used to. I bought this watch just for the INDIGLO light feature and past great luck with Timex watches, however, this one did not do well. I was very disappointed with this watch. Would not reccommend this watch."
5,Easy Reader Watch,"Love it! I originally bought a Timex Easy Reader Indiglo watch about 12 years ago and loved it. After several batteries and years of daily wear, the last battery only worked for a few months. Figuring it was old and time for a new one, I bought this one. While waiting for the new one, I took the old one back to the store for a new battery. It's still working and I also have the new one.It's easy to read the numbers and the indiglo is great. The date is a little small, but my other watch didn't have that, so I don't really use it. I recommend this watch very much!"
1,fogged up after two months,"I like the look and feel of this watch but, after only two months, moisture got inside, the face fogged up, and then the light stopped working. When I on went back on-line on Amazon to try to return it, I found out the return period had expired."
2,Date too small to read,"I bought this watch for my wife. Initially, she liked it. She wore it for a day and said the band was uncomfortable. Also, the Easy Reader's date is not so easy to read. It is miniscule. She and I both have trouble reading the date with our glasses on. I almost returned it without showing it to her, as I thought it looked smaller than advertised, and not very sturdy. It is very lightweight. When I tap on the face it has that plastic sound. I thought the whole thing was plastic, but they claim the bezel is metal. It doesn't seem able to withstand any abuse. My wife has a physical job, and we don't think it would hold up. So we are returning it to Amazon. If your looking for a sturdy, comfortable watch, this is not it. The numbers are easy to read, but not the date.I love shopping with Amazon, return shipping is free and easy."
5,Timex Watch,I was very please with this and the wife needed something to wear to work.And i rember back when timex was the best watch to purchase to hold up.And the saying was Timex takes a licking but keeps on ticking.Thanks Again
1,Bad battery,"I ordered this watch from Amazon on December 30, 2011. It arrived in a timely manner, but as of today (January 23, 2012) it no longer works. The box bottom says 2009, so I guess the battery is dead! Lasted less than three weeks for me!"
5,Retro stylish,Nice everyday to dressy watch. It's retro look takes me back! The typical hi quality of Timex is a plus.
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this watch for my daughter who is visually impaired. The first watch did not run. The return process was EXCELLENT. The watch itself had a very small face, not the same proportion as the illustration depicts. With the back lighting on, there is more contrast and she can view the time with effort. Service in ordering this watch was excellent. Product was just ""OK."""
2,Timex womens easy reader watch,"Always bought timex womens easy reader watch, although I'm having trouble with this one! Purchased couple of months ago, and it loses time already, sometimes almost 15 minutes, can't be the battery already!"
3,"Loved watch, hated condition","HelloI was delighted to have received my watch within a short amount of time. It was beautiful, functional and kept perfect time. After a week, however the battery died. If a new battery had been inserted before sale, I would have rated this much higher"
3,"Graceful, substantial watch","This watch reminds me of the M & Co watch that has been priced at $200, except for the thinness of the M & Co watch, which I loved, this watch adds a second hand and a light for the face. The band is leather but the ""graining"" of the band seems to be painted on. As soon as the weather gets warm this graining wears off as the artifice it is. But, you can't beat it for price."
1,"Gorgeous, but not for me.","I was very excited to recieve this watch in the mail. I was stunned by its simplicity and gorgeous finish. I wore the watch for about a week and started to notice the time would freeze from time to time. As a result, the time was constantly off. If my wrist accidentally turns the dial, the second hand stops working. I was always resetting the time. It was very aggravating. The watch is now sitting on my night stand. Even though it is a brand new watch, it has stopped working all together. I am not impressed."
4,"Good Watch, Easy To Ready, Like The Indiglo Light","I'm very happy with my watch...got it about a month ago from Amazon. It's very functional, not super stylish, but attractive. The indiglo lighted dial is really nice and the numbers very easy to read. I didn't have as much trouble reading the date numbers as some other reviewers did, but I agree they could have been just a little bigger. Was super happy with the price. The same watch on another store site (sounds like ""jaycee pemmys"" ;-) was twenty dollars more."
2,The ticking is too loud.,This watch looks okay and is quite sturdy but the ticking noise is way too loud - it annoys me.
3,face is a little to large.,This item is nice. I think the face is a little to large but other than that it is ok. Nothing special.The band is not leather but some type of plastic material.
4,Easy to read,Easy to read but band stiffI hope it will soften upOverall though it's a good quality for the price
4,timex women's watch,The watch is easy to read and the illumination feature is great. I would have liked the watch band to be a little wider.
4,Really cute,"Really great product, the only thing that bothers me, is one of the straps sometimes scratches me, but that happens."
5,"Inexpensive, practical, handy!","This is a great out-of-the-box watch. It's simple, easy to read, has a fairly durable band AND a light for when you don't want to turn over and strain to see the digital clock on your nightstand. Perfect for Mom!"
5,timex,just what i wanted timex is still the best. i am thinking about getting one for my mother-in-law for christmas
3,OK but......band too small,"This watch does everything that I thought it would do except the band was too small for my wrist. I wish that Timex or whatever company it is, would have the size on the package. Necklaces all have how many inches. Why not the watches? So I get a new watch and the first thing that I have to do was go buy a watch band. This is not quite the way that you want to get a watch."
5,Great looking and easy to read; reasonably priced,"So far, so good; keeps great time and is a nice size; easy to read and fashionable too."
4,Great watch but date is hard to read.,"I'm very happy with this watch. It fits my narrow wrist and is easy to read, even in the dark because of the Indiglo feature. The date inset where the 3 would be is the only thing difficult to read."
2,What has happened to TIMEX??,"I have always loved Timex - simple designs, sturdy, comfortable construction and perfect time keeping! Alas, they too have gone by way of the cheaper, less reliable products that inundate our world these days. Why you, Timex???!!!! The watch I bought recently looked great to me - just like the picture and I was very excited to put it on. First thing I noticed is that the band is shorter than I expected and stiffer - not at all comfortable! Then, after only a few days of wear, I looked down to see the time and found the crystal was blurry. As I looked closer I realized it was totally scratched up!!! I am not hard on my watches and Timex has never done that before! I guess the crystal is plastic now... I'm so disappointed! I'm going to try and get my money back and find a watch brand that is a little more sturdy... Good bye my old friend!"
4,Timex Women's Watch,"Timex Women's Watch - I like the face of the watch because the large black letters on the white face of the watch are easy to read. I guess that's why it's called the Easy Reader. I like the brown leather strap, also."
4,"Nice, simple watch","I'm tired of velcro watch bands and digital watches, so I ordered this one. I'm hoping the battery lasts a long, long time, since it's so basic, without a lot of features. It has indiglo, which is nice when you need it, but I'm hoping I don't accidentally knock the button often, which would make the battery wear out a lot faster. The watch band is still a little stiff, but I'm sure it'll conform to my wrist after I wear it a few more days (today was the first day I've worn it)."
4,"Strong, Fun, Funky Album By RHCP","If you are a Chili Peppers fan, chances are you will like this one. Released in 1995 with Dave Navarro on guitar, this album was a huge alternative hit and many of its songs were played constantly on the radio. Grunge ushered in the era when alternative music became cool with the mainstream crowd and Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of the biggest bands of this time. ""One Hot Minute"" is a mix of hard rock, punk, and funk and is a lot of fun though it is not my favorite Chili Peppers album. My favorite tracks are:Warped - reminds me of something Led Zeppelin would have done if they had a little funk in them.Aeroplane - an easy-going tune that gets stuck in your head after just hearing it onceDeep KickCoffee Shop - love the reference to Iggy PopIf you are new to the Chilis, then start off with either ""Mother's Milk"" or ""Blood Sugar Sex Magic"". After listening to them, then pick this one up."
5,FINALLY!,Finally this movies gonna come out! I've been waiting since 2008 & finally it has release date. I've loved t.A.T.u. since I was in 4th grade & now I'm a freshman in college. Disbanded or not I will always support them :) t.A.T.u. forever!<3
2,ok i guess,movie was alright. the acting was ok. the plot to me and my partner was kinda confusing and seemed to jump into the story without much background on what was going on. not the worst movie but not something i'm probably going to watch again
1,what a waste....,This was a complete waste of money....use a few drops of bleach in your fountain to maintain the water..It wont hurt the birds at all...I have been doing that for months...
3,Tedious,"This is not a simple introduction to Frege. It isn't bad, but I found Anthony Kenny's ""Frege"" and Joan Weiner's ""Frege Explained"" to be more lucid introductory texts. If you are very new to Frege, try Weiner's book first (Salerno's book on Frege is also worth a mention and preferred) . But even if you aren't new to Frege's thought, it's hard to see how much is gained by laboring with Noonan's introduction.Don't forget to read Frege himself (see the Blackwell Readers, _The Frege Reader_). Frege is a top notch writer and his own words deserve attention and careful study."
4,Awesome headset,This is a really great headset. I mostly use it for Modern Warfare 2. It lets you hear better so that you know people are coming. The only bad things are the long cords. I ended up using cable ties to shorten them. Also the earpiece sometimes makes my ear sore on one side. Otherwise it's just what I wanted.
4,Works great!,"I got this because mainly it works with both the PC and the Xbox 360. It took me a minute to figure out how to hook it up to the Xbox but once I hooked it up it worked perfectly. I hooked it up via the headphone output on the tv instead of using RCA cables as I have the xbox hooked up via hdmi. I had to adjust the tv sound output as the bass was pretty overwhelming and that had nothing to do with the headphones. According to my friends my voice came through loud and clear. I had no buzzing noise in the background either. Works just as well with the pc. Easy to transfer from one to the other. Construction is solid and does not feel like it will break easily. I have no idea how it compares to the more expensive headphones, but it sounds great to me and I can definitely hear sounds better than just listening to the tv speakers. I wore them for about half a day without any real discomfort on the ears."
4,Great Budget Headset,"Headset works very well. In online games you can hear someone behind you enough to tell if they are on the left or the right. I have had no problems with this headset at all. I barely turn it up at all to make it very loud. No feedback, no problems. I have a friend with a $300 headset, and i could not tell any difference at all. Just because you spend more, doesn't mean you get more. I wear these sometimes for 4+ hours at a time. Your ears will get a little sweaty, but that is a minor complaint. I heard things i never heard before in games, and i was playing while wired through a stereo.....birds in the trees, frogs in swamps....if you are considering a headset this is a great choice. It is ALL plastic though, I am in my 30's, I am pretty sure a kid under 12 wouldn't take good care of these and they would break. I know i won't break it, but i could see they way kids treat things they wouldn't last."
1,buzz,"Used it to play xbox360. During quiet scenes you can really notice a slight buzz (at least on the pair I bought) and the little LED light on the outside of the headset, that flashed when in use, also created a little buzz noise every time it flashed. at first i ignored it and during loud scenes you don't seem to notice, but after a while it drove me a little crazy and i returned them."
1,"Major hassle to set up, tons of wires everywhere!","It's amazing to me that, out of all the reviews posted here, nobody mentioned the fact that there are wires running everywhere when you hook this up. If you think you're going to plug this headset into your controller and be off an running, think again. It is unacceptable to me to have three or four wires criss-crossing the floor from TV to couch and then a few more wires hooking the headset to the controller. It's crazy. I would have never purchased this had I known it was so complicated and that I'd be back in the wired dark-ages of 1985 using it. Really strange that no one else mentioned any of this in the other reviews. Get this baby hooked up and you'll look like you're ready for a research experiment. Terrible."
4,awesome for xbox,it is exactly what i was looking for to hear my action games on xbox. The sound is unbeleiveable and I would definitely recommend it .
3,works good but too much wire,"I personally would buy the more expensive wireless earforce for xbox 360 this had multiple long wires that get all tangled up too easily. wires that connect to your tv, xbox 360, and xbox 360 controller. too much wires for me. but yes the sound is good. the sound is reflected on your left or right side too depending on where the sound is supposed to be coming from on the game which makes that helpfull when things are coming at your from a certain direction. the mic worked well when I used it on xbox live."
3,"Ear Force X1 wired headphones works great with XBox 360, but not at all with my Vista laptop","Positive:- Very long cords- Works great with my XBox 360- Has inline hookups so that you can still play audio through your speakers and headphones at the same time. This is only a benefit if you are playing alone because if you playing with others on XBox Live, you will have the headphones on.Negative- Doesn't work at all with my Vista laptop (Dell Precision M90). I thought I might be able to get rid of my USB Logitech headphones and use only this product, but that didn't work out. Now, I still have two sets of headphones.- Hurts my ears after a few hours of game play. If it had about a 1/4 deeper ear well, my ears would be fine."
4,Great product,"the only bad things about these headphones are that it gets a little hot in your ear the first couple of times. and if you turn up you mic volume to hear people, there's a slight echo"
3,It's good for the money... but...,"It's worthwhile to grab for the money.. however, if you're really looking for professional grade headphones, I wouldn't be satisfied.The bass is -WAY- too loud, and there's no way to change it on the headphones nor on the 360. The voices that come in are extremely muffled and hard to understand. I can easily hear them well enough if I turn the volume up, but then I can hardly hear the game sound when anyone else is talking, which defeats the advantages of having them in the first place."
3,It is a slightly above average headset,The X1 is of great build quality from my experience but I figure I am not rough with any of my equipment. After some time using with this headset I came to realize it really only shines in voice communication. If you have a hard time with your stock xbox mic and can't hear people this is a must upgrade but if you want some real performance headphones to help immerse you more into the game then you should look elsewhere. You cannot raise the volume up or you will get bass distortion and even more so if you are trying to chat at the same time. Get this headset if you are still using your tv speakers and game more in multiplayer experiences over solo campaigns you won't be disappointed.
3,They're allright,"I think they are great. The only downside I have noticed is that there is WAY to much bass, with no means of adjusting it."
3,Xbox 360 HDMI Audio Adapter,"Xbox 360 HDMI Audio AdapterIf you use an HDMI to hook up your 360 to your TV then you MUST have this cable. If not...get one. If you are using regular component AV Cables (red,white,yellow) then you should have no problem. The packaging on the box is misleading. It says it will work with an HDMI hookup but it doesnt tell you that you need the cable attachment first for it to work. It does have a bit too many cables but they are worth it sneaking up on someone in COD MW2 and taking them out. 2 Stars for the misleading box. 3 Stars for the product."
1,The worst possible headset out there.,"This headset is a nightmare. When i got it ([...]) i was pretty excited, thinking that this headset will end my habit of dying headset (this was my 7th headset). Before a week of use, the boom broke. i call support, set it back, and got it replaced. Once i plugged it in, the sound didnt work, called, sent it in, replace. The it work for about a month, in till the part where it connects the controller shorted. Called, sent that back SIX TIMES, and kept getting new ones, in till they said that they dont cover that anymore. I nearly sh@t a brick. Later, i got a Microsoft Wireless Mic for $[...], and i have been using that SAME mic for about 2 years. Dont buy this garbage, but the official wireless mic if you wish to speak freely on XBL."
1,X11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Dont buy now because there is an x11 out now that will be a lot better!!! i bought this and would much rather prefer the x11.
2,dont pay for shipping!,i ordered the x1 turtle beach headphones 8-10-09 and i paid for 3-5 day shipping.the delivery estimate is 8-19-09.what kind a B.S. is this!
5,Amazin,"I have to say, this is probably the best investment I have made in my gaming career so far. With it, my overall performance has increased dramatically. I can now hear when people are trying to sneak up behind me in the game, but not in real life due to the incredible noise canceling. It also works amazing with music playing, too."
2,Good headset - while it works...,"I paid $60 for these at Best Buy. I should have taken the hint the first time, when I had to return them after one day because the left earphone stopped working. But I persisted and got a new pair of X1s which worked OK for about 5 months. Then, the microphone stopped working. Bottom line - it's nice to be able to hear the game sound through the headset, and the X1 does a decent job of that, but the reliability is not good enough, especially for the price point. You can get a Hong Kong copy of these on eBay for about $8 shipped. At that price, the X1's shortcomings would be forgivable."
2,Mic stopped working in less than a year,"When this worked, it was a fine product. Unfortunately within the first year, my mic was giving me issues. I was always the guy on Live whose mic was giving everyone else static. Then just when the product was a year old the mic went out completely. Their customer service was helpful and sells a replacement part they say would probably fix the problem. The part is $5, but another $7 for shipping (for a tiny part that weighs a couple of ounces if that), and no guarantee that it will fix the problem. I might just go ahead and shop around for another headset with a better warranty, but they don't have much competition."
1,cracked in 2 months,"I bought these to use with my xbox 360 and loved them at first. Then I noticed that one side was cracking (thinner plastic part on side) and when I put them on, the part that was screwed together (see the pictue to see the screws) pulled apart and I couldn't wear them. I checked the other side and it was cracking in the same exact spot. I went to their website and checked out their warranty and was surprised that the ""warranty"" doesn't seem to cover anything at all. They lasted about 2 months. What a disappointment."
2,Purchased this twice. Broke both times.,"When they work they are just as good as any other stereo w/chat headset. but the problem is i found out the hard they are made very cheaply. both times the chat puck broke within 8-15 months. I bought this headset a very long time ago when it was $100 then again after it was reduced to $60 all money down the drain, as now Turtle Beach no longer supports this or the other style of turtle beach headset i purchased for another $100."
4,It's Useful,I use my x1 to play cod4 clan matches.I use for people who use dead silence.Overall its a amazing headset but wen u walk u can hear urself.Its comfortable but if u use it for more than 3 hrs it will make ur ears tender and swore.I would recommend this headset over the regular xbox live mic.I havent used the more expensive ones yet so i cant compare it to x3 or astros.
4,A very good headset for the cost,I bought this instead of the more expensive models as I didn't want to spend more than $50 on a headset. But you get what you pay for. It's very good quality for durability and sound. You can hear EVERYTHING on the map when you play games like Call of Duty or Left 4 Dead. There are a lot of wires but it's not enough to get in your way if you set it up right. My ONLY gripe with the headset is the bass can sometimes overwhelm the other sounds of the game so you have to tinker around with the volume of the game and the volume of the in game chatter. Everything else is good though. The set up is quick and painless unless you don't have a basic concept of english instructions... then you might have a tough time... but if that's the case then perhaps you should stick to a simpler game like hangman or tic tac toe.
1,not working after 10 days,"I purchased this Turtle Beach headset for my son for Christmas. He has used them three times and the microphone has stopped working. I have contacted Turtle Beach and have not heard from them. For this reason, I would not recommend these headsets"
2,"Comfortable headphones, but the sound quality is lacking.","These headphones are very comfortable, and seem well made. Unfortunately, the sound quality isnt very good. The bass is too pronounced, and there are virtually no mid-tones. This means that speech is not reproduced well. Voices on XBOX Live are very muffled, and it is very hard to understand what people are saying. Just for that, I dropped the rating 2 stars."
2,snapshots parading as art,"If you cut out two thirds of this book it might be worth the money. This concept of snapshot photography passing as the new art form is beginning to get real old. Wake up and smell the coffee people, Nan Goldin's fifteen minutes is up. In fact, it's been up. If you really need to pay (price) to see unattractive people do unattractive things, here it is. Now, with that said, the other third of this book is interesting. It would have made a nice little book for (price)."
2,Beautiful but extremely fragile,Beautiful and useful but it only lasted two weeks before cracking. It did not hold heat as well as I'd hoped--perhaps not enough air space between layers of glass.
2,"OK, seems better to just check on the internet","Seems to be missing a lot, but maybe the alternative would mean it would be the size of a large dictionary?"
3,Cloud 9?!,"As a very basic, breeze over reference book, it does it's job. However, if more in depth analysis and reflection is desired then look elsewhere. Remember that this book is simply a jumping off point to help you in analyzing your own dreams. It is lacking many common terms. Recommended for the heavy-eyed, light sleeping reader who requires immediate satisfaction."
5,Replacing my 1994 edition,"This is a great book on dream analysis. The symbols are given a broad spectrum of meanings, although I could do without the Freudian interpretations. Fortunately, many other theorists are referenced in the dictionary, including Jungian analysts. I've had this paperback since 1994; the spine is broken, pages are falling out, and I keep it together with a rubber band! Time to replace it. I'll get a new one since I reference this older copy a few times a week, and I'd like one that will last another 15 years.I find it helpful to write about my own understanding of symbols, and previous dreams that used those symbols, and after that, consult this book to add more depth. The dream exercises are probably helpful for newbies. Happy dreaming!"
5,Fun dice,"My three-yr old is nuts for these dice-in-dice dice. We play lots of games with them. I'm not sure how they're distinct from just having two different colored conventional dice, except that they are odd and fun."
3,3.5 stars,"Surprisingly good is this odd effort from a zillion years ago. Trevor Rabin must have been a weee lad when recording this with Rabbit, so that's why it gets 3.5 stars and not the dreaded 2 stars. The songs, albeit very melodic, sound like Bread rejects, but have a bit of progressive flashes that are a sign of things to come from the incredibly talented Rabin. The album has a very cool 70s vibe and very good production values, it's a real timepiece. A crackling cover of Tull's ""locomotive breath"" in here and is rather nifty. Overall this effort won't make your music collection complete or or a joke, but it's a nice listen for the curious casual Rabin fans out there. Me, I'm a huge Rabin fan, so I had to get it."
3,Good but not good enough,This book offers a glimpse at Jeet Kune Do principles as they are applied to the sport of Kickboxing. The focus mitt drills as well as the other drills are explained correctlly but the poor photography really doesn't reveal the tecniques in the best form. Also this book was written in the 80's as a current Asst. Instructor in JKD I can tell you that the techniques and strategies in JKD have changed quite a bit since this book was written. For a better read pick up Principles of a Complete Fighter by Ron Balicki. It gives you a good view of current JKD training and strategy
3,"thick, stiff, hard to adjust, but real hemp","These had extremely thick soles and the straps were very stiff and hard to undo/adjust, which makes the sandals very hard to get on and off. Perhaps over time this shoe would have been more comfortable and functional, but we did not have the patience to endure the break in period. They are the only real hemp sandals I've been able to find on the internet, so perhaps they are okay. Wish I could find some in a men's size 13."
3,Ask the parrot,"It was an easy book to read, very entertaining. Very good kept you wondering who would end up where, liked it"
3,Parker among the straights,"First I have to say that Stark's body of work easily rates five stars compared to anyone else writing crime thrillers that I know of. Three stars for this one is by comparison with the others since ""Comeback"". They just had more going on. ""Ask the Parrot"" (wonderful title) is quieter and works on a smaller stage. In fact, as I think about it, (especially recalling the chapter from the parrot's point of view) perhaps I'm underrating it. Stark keeps on inserting the catalyst named Parker into social chemistry, setting off satisfying new explosions every time."
5,These books get better and better,"There was a point after reading this book (in two short nights) when I realized how deceptively clean this book was. The story was simple, but it wasn't. The characters were clearcut, except where they weren't what they seemed. And the writing was just perfect. The worst thing I can say about this book is that it was too short. I've been reading Westlake/Stark for several years and he just gets better.Oh, and one really noir-ish note. When you read it, look for the sky in this novel. There is plenty of atmosphere in the book, but it's the kind that creeps down your neck as you read."
3,Great subject poor execution,"I love Bruce Springsteen, I have since I was a kid. I never had any desire to read a book about him, but I gave it a try nonetheless. Thinking subject matter like this would be a ripping yarn. It's not. It's ok, enjoyable even, but for every story that rings true, it comes with a coat of gloss"
2,Substance fine; Kindle version editing sucks,"The book is quite interesting. I think the substance is great for casual and new Springsteen fans. But the editing of the Kindle edition is shamefully sloppy. For example, ""Clarence Clemons"" is often identified as ""Clarence demons""! Really? How about a real editing job and not letting some kind of texting autocorrect feature handle those duties."
3,Don't Buy Kindle Format,"Now that I've read this fantastic book on my Kindle, I need to purchase the print version just so I can read and enjoy it without all the conversion to Kindle errors - most notable Clarence Clemons constantly referred to as Clarence demons. This is the first book that I've purchased for my Kindle that I did not enjoy reading on my Kindle."
1,Tedious,This was less of a biography then an extended Rolling Stone record review. The only thing Dave Marsh likes better than Springsteen is Dave Marsh. If you want to read the author repeat his interpretation of the lyrics for hundreds of pages and harp on a couple of his own simple-minded themes over and over then this is the book for you. I found this book almost unbearable to finish even though I am a big Springsteen fan.
3,Good for a while,"This camera has sharp pictures, ease of use, and a good zoom. However, it suffers from a design flaw. To turn the camera on or off, you must slide the lens cover to one side. This design is fragile and thus vulnerable to breaking. We have fixed it once within the first year of use. Recently, it broke again. Fixing it again is more than it is worth, especially given that such a repair would only be temporary. Instead, we are looking for a new camera--one with a traditional (and sturdier) on/off switch."
5,Olympus Stylus 120 35mm camera w/zoom,The camera takes very good pictures and my wife prefers this camera over a digital camera.
2,Too Sensitive,"This camera has it's good points and bad points as do all things in this world, but the bad points outweigh the good ones.First the few good points: The pictures turn out nicely (focus kept in center) and the automatic features are great (the film loading and rewinding).Now for the bad points: It's too sensitive -- mine got jostled once and now it only takes pictures every now and then (I have to press the shutter release a ton of times before it'll take a picture -- and sometimes it just wont take a picture) The focus is difficult to use since the viewfinder is blurry so it makes it extremely difficult to tell if you're getting a clean shot. (focus is best if kept in the center)All in all, I do not recommend this camera I personally don't think it's worth the time, effort, frustration, or money."
5,Very imformative and fast reading!!!!,"I found this book to be very informative and extremely fast reading. I am not one to fully immerse myself into a book, but I found myself becoming more interested in the subject, page-by-page. If anyone is a novice like myself in the field of wines, I highly recommend this book. It will bring you up to speed in no-time!"
1,Fully Disappointed!,Not at all what I was looking for. There are several books out there that cover wine and its origins better than this one.
5,"Must-have kids book with nonsense, geography & lots of fun.","This classic Canadian kid's book crosses the continent with fun poems and stories from north of the border. There are a number of nonsense rhymes, and many others which follow a typical child's line of thought to those surprise and imaginative conclusions that make children such a delight! Once in a while, a good map of Canada will add an extra dimension of enjoyment, introducing the young audience/reader to another country and to the world of maps. It is, however, the whimsical and imaginative poems which will hold the attention of both child and adult. Soon, the whole family will be chanting, ""Alligator pie, alligator pie, if I don't get some......"""
1,did not fit yet to get my refund,This item took a long time to come and then it did not fit on my carriage. Sent it back ups and have not yet gotten my refundnot happy at all
2,"cute, but not of the great","this movie is OK, not a Jim Henson best, but its OK, visually cool, but stories are short and not real interesting either"
2,Don't expect something light like Sesame Street,"This video isn't quite what we were expecting from a box aimed at kids and featuring Muppets. The stories are all very heavy-handed and quite depressing. Yes, I know that the subject mattter (deforestation, endangered animals, pollution, etc.)is nothing to laugh at, but I guess I wasn't expecting to see little Fraggles choking to death."
5,The comfort of a mother,"My baby bear falls fast asleep to this cd; however, I re-burned it to have the lullaby at the beginning and a few more of the nature songs following. I have given this cd to all of my friends that are new moms. I wish you and your baby a peaceful sleep."
3,Good but does not lay very flat,"I bought this for use in my home because I have pets that love chewing wires. It is very strong and durable, but it does not lay as flat as advertised which has made it slightly cumbersome. Still, it gets the job done."
3,alright for the money,"This came rolled up and after a month it still doesn't lay totally flat on the floor on the ends, thats about the only irritation. I don't use adhesive and its on a flat wooden floor (this wouldn't be so hot on carpet). its pretty low profile, my neato robo vac gets over it (and it can be finicky about such things) and I have yet to trip over it. Given the price i'd probably buy it again for the same application, would be kinda nice if it was a bit wider, still would get again regardless."
3,"Protects the cords OK, but the 2 sided tape doesn't hold it down.",The 2-sided tape does not hold the protector to carpet so we had to lay a mat over the protector so it wouldn't slide out of place or get kicked out of place.
3,Beige not Ivory,"Product is good. Works well. The color is Beige, not ivory - much darker then the picture.Good price and a touch item. Making it stick to the ground is an issue with all cable handlers. This one allows you to tuck the ends into furniture or carpet so it holds better. It better to have it anchored somewhere.Rating is because the color name and picture is not accurate. Search the web and you will get a more accurate picture of the color."
1,very bad,"Yesterday, I received this item. I tried to use it and here is the disaster. First, it comes almost gray in color not like the picture in the advertisement. Second, it never sticks to the Floor or the wall whatever I tried to do. Third, can't curve specially when you have angel, it will directly pop up out. finally useless."
4,Floor protector,This is 15 ft so I cut it in half and ran my monster wires in the bottom section and so far its worked perfect. No more wires running under my rug. I'd recommend it to anyone.
3,"Good Product, bad delivery","I ordered from Amazon, as this size and color wasn't at my or any home depot stores. The product is a great item and apparently a little hard to find in ivory in any size over 5ft. But when I received it had already been cut, I'd say about 3ft or so. It was still in the box, but in two pieces. Luckily I only needed about 10ft so the bigger of the two pieces was big enough for what I wanted. I told amazon about this and they offered me a return which would been fine if the bigger of the two didn't fit. I'd say its okay and amazon is pretty good, but be careful."
4,Tape was a nightmare,"I used this in an apartment, one part across a door frame (Ethernet + HDMI), another across the main walk area (Ethernet), and they definitely kept the cords down. Can be difficult to run two cables through at once. The adhesive tape was a bad decision to use on carpet, since it gums up heavily after 9 months of being stepped on, where a typical double-sided foam tape might not."
3,Color not Ivory more like Dark Tan,"I purchased this cord cover to go in a room where the floors are white. The picture looks white. The description said it was ivory. I figured that would be close enough. It's a DARK TAN! I ended up feeding the cord into the closet so it won't show but I am very disappointed in the color. Also, the double-faced tape designed to hold it down, isn't working very well."
2,Wont stay down!,"the quality of the actual protector is great but the quality of the double sided tape that keeps it down it horrible. Since its wound in a coil, it has a tendency to curl up once you put it on the floor and when placed on carpet, the tape isn't strong enough to hold it down."
1,More Internet Hype!,"This book is very useful if one has a table with one short leg (place it under the short leg to stabilize the table). IF you want insightful, RELEVANT information on online dating... look some place else! Look in the mirror, because this book is page after page of cliches and observations that only the brain-dead don't already know. If your reading level is above the sixth grade, you will want to pass on this one! cheers! and good hunting!"
4,Insightful and enjoyable.,"If you've looked for love on the Internet, you need to read this book. Everyone else should read it anyway. Dr. Gwinnell articulates the reasons online friendship and romance are so compelling. The book is full of insight and practical advice."
2,hm,"I bought this cd because i fell in love with the song ""Im Stupid"". I heard the song many years ago, and never knew who sang it. When i finally found out, i was excited to purchase the cd. I assumed that since the song was amazing, then maybe the album would be aswell. I was wrong. The only good song on the entire cd was ""Im Stupid"". Now i can honestly see why this band was a 1 hit wonder. It wasnt worth buying just for one song."
5,alot like Forty Foot Echo - just incredible,"Every somg on this cd is great. Certainly one the best recent cd's I have heard. This cd is alot like Forty Foot Echo - every song is great, they have a very similar style and sound, the vocals are awesome, the whole cd is great. I persomnally think Forty Foot Echo is a more talented group of musicians, with a little more diversity, but I love both of these albums. Hope to hear more from Prime sth."
5,Beatiful earring jackets,I got these extremely quickly and they're just beautiful. They fit perfectly with my 1.6 tcw diamond earrings. I' very happy with them!
4,very good,"It is comfortable for my grandson from 4 Years old, easy to handle and to turn, but more importantly it is safe.Already used sometimes ran 10 miles and I love it."
3,Nice stroller for the price.,"I bought this stroller to use solely for walking/running with my son. We use it on pavement, grass & sand. It covers all grounds smoothly. Compared to other jogging strollers it is an excellent price for similar quality. I love the fact that the handle raises & lowers and it has a rain protector that unzips from the canopy to come down in front to cover my son if we get caught out in bad weather. On the downside, my brake doesn't work & no matter how many times I adjust the front wheel I cannot get the alignment straight. It always veers a little to the left."
4,Great Jogger,"I've tried several different joggers and haven't been able to find one that measures up to the Free Runner. My 2 year old is big for his age and it looks like he will fit and be comfortable for another few years which is what prompted me to purchase this particular jogger. I've run several 5Ks since purchasing in Oct. This jogger is easy to handle as far as steering and light weight (even with a 30 lb child on board). It is easy to break down to fit into my compact vehicle and a breeze to put together. Other joggers I've had required constant readjustment after breaking down and putting back together, but this one does not. The under storage is large enough to hold blankets, breakfast, and a diaper bag for the early morning 5K. I love it and so does my son. He usually ends up asleep when we go for a run in the mornings. The free shipping was extremely fast!! It got here faster than it would have if I had paid for expidited shippping :-)"
3,decent for the price,"I bought this stroller last summer. It is good for what I need it for. However, if you have to make any turns you don't want this one. I wish it had a wheel that would turn in the front. Other than that, no complaints."
3,they don't make them like they used to,"We bought our first Schwinn jogging stroller when our oldest was 6 months old - May 2003. It was incredible! It lasted until summer 2010 with our third daughter in it. Unfortunately I think some of the offroad hikes finally got the best of it and we had to retire it. Having loved the first Schwinn we were sort of fans of the brand so wanted the next one to also be a Schwinn. Overall this Free Runner does as it says it will and provides a comfortabel ride for daughter #3. What I miss about the older version was the built in rain shield, the covered compartment as part of the cup holder feature and the slightly smaller build. This Schwinn is bigger than the older one and honestly feels a bit less sturdy. We won't be using this one for too many off road hikes and instead will stick to using it for jogs on pavement and visits to the weekend soccer games. One plus is the adjustable handle and the drink holder for the rider."
1,"Item not new, pulled hard to the left","The item arrived in a badly beaten up box that was clearly not new. It looked like another customer returned the item then they repackaged it and sent it to me. Some of the parts were scratched and there was no manual or other documentation inside the box.I had read other reviews that also had this experience. I had also read that some folks got strollers that pulled to the left. Sure enough, once assembled, this stroller pulled hard to the left. It would go left about 3-4 feet for every 10 feet traveled.I'm returning it for a full refund."
2,Fabric quality is poor,"I returned this product immediately upon receipt. Stroller looks beautiful and is easy to put together but the fabric quality is cheap!!! The sun shade sounds like paper when opened and closed. The seat is made of the same fabric but not as noisy as the seat cushion muffles the sound a little. For a middle of the line stroller, this is not acceptable in my mind and I knew it would bother me everytime I used the stroller...Very sad because it looks great and I researched every stroller out there...Going to try the Joovey next..."
4,She changed my life!,"Annie Sprinkle is a pioneer in the endeavor of losing America's inhibitions. I witnessed her ""Public Cervix Announcement"" and it forever changed my thinking on sex and sexuality. This book, a compendium of her lifes work, is masterful with its illustrations and Annies own story thrown in to give you more of what you see."
4,KEEP THE RIDE GOING ON ROUTE 66,"AFTER GOING BACK,AND SEEING THOSE FIRST EPISODES VOL. 1, WHEN WILL THE 2ND.3RD,AND 4TH. YEARS TAPE BE AVAILABLE? IT WOULD BE CRIMINAL NOT TO MAKE AVAILABLE THESE NEXT EXCITING EPISODES. I NEED THE FIX."
2,Roxbury takes the low road,"What was Roxbury thinking here? It's almost as if they randomly yanked (as opposed to ""hand-picked"") three episodes out of the vault with the notion that fans would buy anything. There's nothing thematic about this selection (they're not even from same season) and (with exception of casting of Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and Peter Lorre in one excrutiatingly goofy episode) they're not even particularly memorable shows. Take a pass."
5,Bring On Season Two!,The second half of the first season(1960-61)of the great Route 66. A truly great series of the early '60s. Bring on season two!Neal Robertson
4,Route 66 Then and Now,"In it's day Route 66 was one of my favorites, I was a car crazy 10 year old and all my 15 year old car crazy brother and I could think about was how badly we wanted a Corvette. It was cool to see a few episodes of the show but this compilation jumps around too much in it's time frame. It would be better to buy a whole season at one time. One thing that is neat is to see some of the young co-stars that have gone on to be mega stars like Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall etc."
5,The most complete compendium ever...,"I have been a student of military history for as long as I can recall. I have never before found a more complete and more perfectly illustrated source for military service decorations and medals. The awarding criterion, histories, proper wear, order of prominence... all these details are covered, from the highest honor to the most basic of awards.The color templates in the book are not to be missed, and I have to agree with the author, LTC Aldebol... If you can own only one Air Force book, this is the one to own!"
5,An exciting read,"""How NASA Learned To Fly In Space"" is, as the sub-title says, ""An exciting account of the Gemini missions."" Gemini, the bridge between Mercury and Apollo, is often overlooked, yet these missions stand as a testament to the skill, flexibility, adaptability, and creativity of the Gemini engineers and astronauts - taking space exploration from the knowledge that man can live in space (Mercury) through to the successful Moon landings (Apollo) - learning all the way. In this book, David Harland gives the reader an incredible sense of the achievements and dangers of each of the ten Gemini missions. The reader feels as though he has been taken along for the ride with the astronauts. This book is a must-have for any space-exploration library!"
5,great history in easy to read format.,this is the most wonderful american history book i have ever seen. a must have for every student. easy to read and very informative. buy this item.
3,WWE New Year's Revolution --1/7/07--,"WWE Title MatchJohn Cena(c) vs UmagaVery good match here, better than I thought it would be.8/10Carlito vs Chris MastersFiller match, to short.4/10Kenny Dykstra vs Ric FlairIt is sad to have Flair lose to this joke.5/10World Tag Team TitlesRated RKO(c) vs DXAwesome match up until HHH injury, then there are some odd sequences.8/10IC Title match-Steel CageJeff Hardy(c) vs Johnny NitroGreat match here as expected.7.5/10Tag Team TurmoilCryme Tyme vs Worlds Greatest Tag Team vs Highlanders vs Super Crazy/Jim Duggan vs Cade/MurdochFiller, but was not to bad.6/10Women's TitleMickie James(c) vs VictoriaSurprisingly bad match between the 2 best female wrestlers now that trish and lita have retired.3/10"
3,"Cute and Funny, if Short","I've had this book for *years* and just re-read it (it's an insanely quick read--only about 40 pages). It's still funny--often hilarious. Now, however, I wonder about the authenticity of some of the signs, as the book provides absoultely no preface or foreword to tell the reader about the quotes origins. On top of that, most of the pictures look like they were either staged or else doctored in some graphics program. The remaining pictures aren't even photographs--they're illustrations of the signs!Nevertheless, I think the book deserves three stars for its concept and amusement, if nothing else. I'd love to see a humorist take this idea further some day, with better authenticated photographs, but this short book is definitely funny enough for the moment."
1,built to fail,"I have owned 2 different Flotec tanks in the past 5 years, and each bladder has failed after about 2.5 years. When they fail, they cause tremendous burden on the system including the pressure switch and the well pump, unless you are home and realize what has happened... which is not likely. I will not buy another Flotec product since they don't stand behind their products either."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"If you like to waste money, then this is the tank for you. I had this tank for only 3 years before the bladder split. Yes they do sell a replacement bladder for $90.00 plus shipping which would make it closer to $100.00. Problem is it was extremely hard to remove the old bladder from the tank. I can just picture damaging the new bladder while trying to get it thru the small opening. If the bladder only last 3 years then this tank is is no bargain. I finally decided to spend a a few hundred more and purchased a Well-X-Trol Tank from Amtrol. Tank comes with a 7 year warranty. All I can say is that Flotec Tanks are junk!"
1,This tanks specs are a physical impossibility,"Do the math, a 24x54 tank has a MAXIMUM internal volume of a little over 100 gallons, NOT 220 gallons.Roger McCarthy"
1,TigerDirect customer service,"This was the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon, and I've made quite a few.I had accidentally damaged the front-plate of the DVD-player during installation, and called TigerDirect to discuss. I told them that the issue may have been due to my installation issues, but wanted to know what their policy was in that case.They agreed to take the item back. However, they were very rude during this process. At one point, one of the engineers said they couldn't hear me and that my connection must be bad. I think he was joking around because the second I offered to give-up on returning the item, he could suddenly hear me again."
2,"A poor Rock album, but a pretty good Jazz album","Caravanserai contains none of the great rock rhythms that drove Santana's first 3 albums. This is pretty much a jazz album. The great melodies found in 'Oye Como Va' and 'No One To Depend On' are long gone, replaced by long jazzy instrumental numbers. The few vocals you find here are poorly done. As usual, the guitar work is excellent. But without strong vocals, lyrics and melodies, this one falls flat. This one is for Jazz lovers only."
3,Not too bad for all that it does.,"IT was surprisingly easy to set up and I was able to record shows to DVD right away. I don't have an HD TV, so I can't comment on the picture too much. It does have a better picture than my old DVD player though. It has helped me convert a bunch of my old videos to DVD which is great.PROS - Easy set up. Very easy to dub from VHS - DVD.CONS - Wont' record copyrighted VHS to DVD. Can be a coaster burner (a lot of DVDs I have burned have been unreadable in any machine). Seems to have problems with the DVD tray opening about 30% of the time. I have to turn off the machine and turn it back on to get the DVD out."
3,Book is okay.,"I have read several books by this author, and enjoyed most of them. This book did not hold my interest as well as others. It seemed a bit choppy. I was disappointed."
4,"This is a retitled work from 1997, then called "" Veritas """,reviewers need to recognize this retitling of an older work
1,Huge waste of time and money,"If you want to spend 4 times as much money, 8 times as much time, and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately ""politely refuse""--THEN BUY THIS BOOK! The author clearly has NO CLUE that ""less is often more."""
1,"great concept, catchy logo but poor fit","I love the catchy logo but the fit on this t-shirt is poor. It clings to the mid section and looks disproportionate when on. I would definitely recommend the mfr to try again. Keep the logo but offer it in a ""soft women's tee style"" as opposed to just a regular t-shirt style. Please go back to the drawing board and try again. I hate to see such wasted effort. Thanks."
2,"Nice photos, disappointing text.","This book has LOTS of nice photos, so if you're interested in this subject it is worth adding to your collection. However, in many places the text is poorly written and edited (even some of the photos are misidentified), and some of the information presented is poorly researched - not what you might expect from a person with a Masters degree and numerous literary credits to his name. The typo's, occasional shabby grammar, and other inconsistencies are most annoying, so reading it is something like trying to listen to the radio through moderate static. It's not all bad, but this reviewer recommends that you buy it for the photos, not its less-than-impeccable accuracy or other literary ""graces""."
4,Bad pedals and seat,The bike has many programs. But the seat is not soft; it is also hard to tighten the pedals.
3,"Exercise bike, great price and looks great, if I could assemble it...","I bought this because I needed an exercise bike and the price was beyond belief. Well, it is all assembled other than I can't get the pedals properly into the sockets. That may be my own problem, as I am worried about stripping the threads or forcing the screwing in of the pedals. I'm going to use some WD-40 and try again...for now it has been unused. But, will be again attempting the assemblage and assume things will go better in this new year."
5,an excellent medical thriller,"Well-written, good characters, great plot. This book has everything a medical thriller needs to hold interest and entertain. I'm looking forward to the next one from this author. (And it would make a great movie)"
3,Serviceable Malice,"""Malice"" opens with some sort of a lullaby that sounds creepy and lovable at the same time. Jerry Goldsmith definitely knows how to create different moods but, in this case, it's only this track that carries real emotions. It's a great theme.However, I'm not as pleased with the rest of the underscore. While Goldsmith creates an atmosphere of tension and drama, the score frankly doesn't reach total excitement as he once did on ""Basic Instinct"" and the Omen trilogy. The score simply seves the movie well; there is too much restraint. I also expected one track -'Clues' -to be another highlight of this album; even though it starts in a very nice Goldsmith action fashion, it goes down to just atmospheric music. Too bad.The main title is the only thing that keeps me interested in ""Malice"". It's just I wish Jerry Goldsmith had done something better in here."
3,envoutant,"jerry goldsmith a encore frapper avec ce score,malice.oui malice terriblement dangereuse,dans le contexte du film.le cd comme le film s'ouvre sur un petit air de musique,comme jouer par un enfant,surprenant de la part de goldsmith,mais evolue en une sorte de choral mystérieuse,des voix de femme soprano,envoutante. un main title séduisant symbolisant l'innocence d'une femme,interpreter par une nicole kidman secrete et innocente,mais derriere cette faade de puretée se cache d'apres le main title,un redoutable prédateur au long cheveux soieux et boucles,createur d'une machination implacable et terrifiante.hormis le main title des morceaux à l'accoutumé de goldsmith,intense et terriblement géniaux.la reputation de goldsmith n'est plus à faire."
3,Almost everything you wanted to know about rockabilly!,"This is an interesting dip into the world of rock n' roll and rockabilly. It would have been more interesting had the copy that I purchased, not gone inexplicably from page 76 to 19!! Thus I shall never know the finer points about Carl Perkins that I was about to read!Certainly though this book is worth getting...although a properly ordered copy might be an advantage! Deserves to be on every rocker's bookshelf!"
2,BUSH PIECES??,We purchased this product thinking it was actual small bushes that we could glue in place to our son's diarama.Instead we received a bag of loose junk that is very difficult (at best) to work with. The color is good however...but the substance of the product was not communicated very well in the write up.
5,A jewel of a song,"I purchased Neil Finn's latest album, _One Nil_, and this is one of the standout tracks, if not THE standout. It's a beautiful, wistful song, a fragile interpretation of lyrics that display Neil's vulnerable side (nothing new to fans of Crowded House or other solo work by Neil). I echo the previous reviewer's praise of wife Sharon's subtle, yet supportive background vocals. I recommend purchasing _One Nil_ (if nothing else, as an import), but if you aren't up for that, AT LEAST pick up this song."
5,Y*E*A*H*,This is my all time favorite CD in the world!You should download a few songs to see for yourself why.
1,My Husband Suggested This...,What can I say...this was the first and last time I'll ever take my husbands advice on a cd to buy! <laugh> It is poorly mixed. What can I say...it sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage. Sorry guys...better luck next time....if there is a next time.
5,Much more than I would have ever expected!,"Ok, I have to admit - when I got PAX217's cd, I had my doubts. I didn't even listen to it before buying it, so I was just hoping and praying it would be good. Boy was I surprised! This cd is my absolute favorite. You don't even need secular music to have fun when Pax217 is here! Awesome beats, a sweet reggae touch, and music that has you jumpin' up and down to keep up. At first it might have an odd sound, but after a few listens -- you'll be hooked - Jesus style."
4,Baddest Thing On Forefront Records,"These dudes have a killer sound. My bud Little T and I saw these guys in concert with Plankeye back in February 2000 and we were totally blown away. The music was tight and loud, and the lead singer Dave Tosti really made a connection with everyone in the audience. The band is really unashamed of the Gospel and are proud to play the music that gives praise to the Most High. The album reminds me of 311 in a lot of ways...but don't think that they're a cheesy rip-off. This is the best album on Forefront (in my opinion) and I suggest you purchase this one."
5,OS2U Kingfisher,I found the Squadron Publication on the OS2U Kingfisher seaplane very informative with great historic pictures. I recently completed a 1/48 scale model of this plane for a family friend who flew on this plane. The information I obtained from this publication added to the accuracy of the model.
2,does not fit cat6 cable,the opening is way to small for a cat6 cable. there's no way you can fit it through. I have to cut the outer skin to fit it.
5,Great DVD,"LOVE this show!! Highly recommend it!All three of my girls have loved this show since they were toddlers & they still love it (they re 10, 6 and 2 now). It's a show tht my husband and I will sing long to and re quote over and over."
2,Great while it lasted,"This had really nice bubbles for about a week. After that, barely any air made it through. Not worth the time and money."
2,Great (at first),"I bought this more my 60 gallon aquarium. It was awesome at first, but after 2 months it has stopped working almost completely. A HUGE disappointment ."
1,junk,I put this in my tank and most the air came out between where the hose hooks on and the flexable part. I'm trying to silicone it to stop it from leaking there and see how long it lasts but I will not ever buy another one
3,Rokenbok R/C Loader,"I innocently bought what appeared to be a fun-to-use toy for my grandson (I had pretty crumby toys as a boy) and am really enjoying shopping for all of my grandsons. I naively assumed that everything needed for operation was included. Not so! When my daughter called to thank me she said that my grandson enjoyed moving it around by hand but there was no radio control mechanism. So, being a good granddad, I went back to the purchase site and bought an R/C controller. It still did not work. I finally managed to ferret out the fact that this toy, in order to operate, requires a transmitter base station, controller, and keys (that come as a set of eight). It would have really helped to know all of the requirements ahead of time."
4,Rokenbok R/C,Can never go wrong with Rokenbok products except they didn't state if a controller came with it or not and we learned when we opened it didn't
2,I would give this 1.5 stars if I could,"My husband did a wonderful job picking out my engagement ring (a 1.75 carat princess cut center stone and two half carat trillion side stones) but I did a poor job picking this as my wedding band. I knew that we would upgrade our wedding bands later on so I picked this one because I thought that it would look fine, it wasn't a big deal, and it would sit nicely with my ring. I'm glad that we didn't purchase two as top and bottom band. Nevertheless, the ring was initially fine but we're in year 3 of our marriage and the ring has turned some bizarre color that looks horrible with my other ring. I've tried getting it cleaned and it'll come back to a relative state of ehh and a week later it'll look ehh again. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this ring....I can only give it a blah."
1,"Full of trivialities, useless","Bought this book based on some of the rave reviews read in here. Could not be more dissapointed. I threw in the towel after 4 chapters. There was nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing in there that was worth any of my time.Do we really need to define the return on a long trade and the return on a short trade? Some other paper-fillers: The definition of drawdown and ""Percent winning months"". No offense, but if you cannot figure these out by yourself, then your money should be in a postal savings account, not in a hedge fund. And you should not be considering starting a hedge fund.Conclusion: Do not buy this book."
2,A hedge fund book among many,The Author is a below average teacher. This book is likely to establish this fact more than teaching the reader about hedge funds.
4,Great for the price!,This Hebrew Bible is certainly a great deal. Hardcover Bible with both Old and New Testaments in Hebrew! I would recommend it for anybody who wishes to own a Hebrew edition of the New Testament. It is affordable and yet still a beautifully bound edition. I am very happy with it!
4,Missing some things,"good overall book for the price, yet I was concerned in some of the readings as this translation may be missing a few key phrases from basic bibles. then since i speak hebrew (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being fluent) about 5 i consider that i know a little bit, but Matthew 6:13 seems to be missing some of the verse. ""for thine is the kingdom power and glory forever amen."" seems to missing at least from my copy. as it ends with mein hara. which is the first part of the passage. Anyway good over book for the price, not sure what else is missing haven't read the whole thing yet."
2,Cheesey,"My daughter received this for her 6th birthday. I thought it would be a fun project for her to do. When she started we found that the paint tubes were half empty, and very hard to press the paint out. She couldn't get the paint out without help. I don't believe there was enough glitter paint for both wings, and the stickers fall off within a day of wear. The wings were also poorly constructed. If you would like similar quality get a wire clothes hanger, and wrap a pink nylon around it, reapeat for other side, and sew together with a piece of felt. Overall I was very under impressed with the quality of the toy, and wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
2,Cute idea. Nice decor included but wings won't stand up,"This product is packaged nicely with all sorts of decor items like gel paint, stickers, flowers, etc. The kids had a lot of fun decorating the wings. However- when it came time to put the wings on, they were so flimsy and would not stand up. Instead, they just kinda flopped around behind the girls' backs. They were very disappointed. Again- a great idea but I think that I'd look for a more sturdy product next time, even if it meant spending a little more."
3,I was looking for more,"I dont mean to let my 3 star rating discourage anyone from reading this book. Its a good book, with utter sincerity from all indie film makers who participated in putting it together.However, I felt that the amount of total information I got from reading this book, did not justify the price I paid for it.Also, except for a few tidbits here and there, there was nothing that I couldnt have myself figured out once I started to think seriously of my movie making venture."
3,Always wanted this !,"You know there are those trinkets that as a child you want SOOOO BAD,That was this book to me and other stuff that shall remain nameless,Love the awesome read !"
1,Very light on substance,I expected a comprehensive guide on living/retiring in Belize. The amount of material is actually very small in this book which spends way too many pages on info of limited relative importance (how to get there for instance) and basically none on the essentials such as real estate. The book is esentially a sales tool for additional 'special reports' written by the authors.
1,NOT MUCH INFORMATION....NOT WORTH THE PRICE!,"I paid for the book and after reading it wanted to send it back. There is very little information for the person that is interested in moving there. If you want that information you have to buy more books or whatever from the authors,again at high prices. It seemed to me that the authors wrote this book to sell more of there books on Belize. I planned on moving to Belize but have to find other books or information to get real information on living there. Sorry, but I think the book is a ...Funny, but I think the authors think the same way. I also got a video on Belize when I ordered the book. The video still didn't give me the information that I wanted."
5,Expat experts!,"Of all the books I've read on Belize, and I've read plenty, the writings of Bill and Claire Gray are the only works I've found that are written by expatriates actually living in Belize.Their writing is a love affair with Belize.If you want to find out about living in Belize they are where we should start."
5,Accel 8mm Spark Plug Wires,"Much better then the OEM or their equivalent. They fit perfect in length and at the fittings (plugs & coils), and best of all, they look good under the hood."
5,Lovely poems,Freda Howell spent many years in the heart of Kentucky and in her garden. These are her poems written over 30 years as she watched the seasons change and her life change. She was and still is a wonderful person at the age of 99. This book was first published when she turned 93. Book is illustrated by her sister.
4,comfy couch,"my granddaughter is thrilled with this, she is at the age were she likes to watch things over and over so having this show on dvd if great. it cute and she loves to sing along"
5,On 2 Review,until a few days ago i found this cd posted on Luis Marte's FB Page who was part of this duo group and i was very well pleased with the songs i heard. Of course alot had to do with not only the singers but the production by Willie Valentin. I recommend purchasing this if you are a true Freestyle fan/supporter.
1,Saville,"I had great expectations but was very dissapointed. Very slow and tedious with few endearing characters. In the end, I could hardly wait for the end which ended with a whimper."
5,Qualifies for City Rebate,"I had two installed along with my new roof. They are quiet and it is noticeably cooler in my house. My city will reimburse the cost of these units, by giving me credit on my utilities bill. So, check with your utilities company to find out if your city offers any incentive.Even without the credit, I think these are worth the money."
5,Barton,"I was really wary of trying to install a solar attic fan myself. I've never attempted anything like this, especially considering that it involves cutting a large hole in the roof. This product was very easy to install (depending on your comport with heights) and came ready to go right out of the box. I have had it on my roof for a few months now and it works great. I also installed radiant barrier and a new thermostat for the house, so I'm not sure to what extent I can credit each piece, but my house stayed at the thermostat setting all summer, something that had NEVER happened in the 10 years that I have owned my home. This fan is whisper quiet (I have to see it to know for certain that it is on). Love it."
4,"Worthwhile choice for ""crawl spaces""","Our crawl space is very difficult to move around, so the price of installing wire to power a traditional exhaust fan was prohibitive. So, solar was a practical choice.Pros: Installation directions were very clear and easy to follow. Worked the moment the sun hit the panel (so keep it covered until fully installed!).Cons: Not as powerful an exhaust as traditional fans, but does the job.Hints: Strongly advise getting the thermostat."
5,Solid,"Just have it installed on one of my attics - running very quite and spinning fast. I have not measured the temperature before and after - but the difference is obvious - before it was VERY hot, now only slightly hotter than room temperature.The unit is built with quality - very sturdy. I had a concern that it is not as efficient as an electrical one in pumping out hot air - but it turns out to spin very fast even with a 10W fan. I had another concern of water leaking, but the unit has a pretty big ""apron"" and a dome cover so it should not be a problem.Now I am thinking to install one more above another attic I have."
5,all it takes is a light,"Delivery on time. When the candleholder came and I took it out of the package my first thought was ""Way too much money for this"". It is rather unassuming at first view. Then when you put the candle in and light it.....totally lovely. I sit and watch the variations of shadow on the wall and no longer feel that I paid too much...well worth it!"
5,When Beaver was Very Great,Anne M. Dunn wrote a powerful book when she wrote When Beaver was Very Great. I loved dancing with corn stalks and how turtle cracked his shell. Reading the book puts one in touch with our natural side in connecting with all things natural.This book truly is a teaching book with words to live by.
4,Great shirt,"The shirt came very quickly, and it runs kind of small but other than that great buy. I am satisfied"
5,GREAT!,"Nice design, easy to assemble. I ordered this table last summer has remained in good condition thru our midwest weather. I would purchase this table again!"
2,wrong cd,"this ""scrabble complete"" is inferior to my previous cd of the same game...You claim there is no more complete ""scrabble complete. My old one placed my letters for me. It also had a much larger vocabulary...I don't like being challenged on a word (examples..Qi, za, etc. MANY words are not allowed that WERE allowed on my other disc. These are just a couple of my complaints. I DO NOT appreciate being told I'm wrong about this...That's a straight out lie on your part...There definitely IS a more complete version. I know, because I have used the better version for YEARS..."
2,Not funny - she is no Dave Barry,"I was very disappointed in this book. I could barely finish reading it. As a big Dave Barry fan, I thought this would be up my alley. She seems to copy Barry's style but the book just is not very funny."
3,"Beautiful Item, Major Flaw","This item is just beautiful, but it has a major flaw that practically makes it useless. The external pump spout is so narrow that lotion or soap harden in it. Product is wasted because those hard little plugs that come out in front of the liquid product are not usable. I wish there was a wider nozzle so that I could actually USE this dispenser. It really is lovely."
3,"Looks great, but bad pump!","This is the 2nd pump that was bought because we had originally broken the 1st one (accidentally dropped the dispenser). The dispenser worked well for approximately 2 months and then it became very difficult to get soap out. The pump appears to be defective. We try to wash out the pump, but could not get it to work. It is now a paperweight since we have not found a replacement pump.The original unit and the unit we currently have had different pumps. The 1st unit was plastic and the 2nd unit appears to be out of metal."
1,I do not recommend.,"I do not recommend this!!!!I have a lot of Lenox Butterfly sets. I satisfied all of them except this.First, the problem was the pump. The stain came out, so I had to clean the surface of it every time. It was terrible! Also it was peeled of the metal coating.Second, it was the butterfly on the bottle. Ironically, I decided to buy this for the butterfly. It looked so well but it was broken when the bottle fell down to my sink. I was so sad, because it happened soon after buying it. Today, my thumb was cut on the broken butterfly ~_~ ...... I threw away...."
4,Neat training book for dogs!!,"I knew absolutely nothing about scent training but this nice little book was a good primer and I was able to get my dogs following scent, using the techniques presented here. I am a horse trainer, not a dog trainer, so I wasn't sure if I could do it, but it works!!"
2,Quality,On these pliers the shank bending parts were not lined up making it VERY hard to bend ring shank without messing the shank up. I'm having a hard time this time around with my purchases. This is the third one.
5,A Breathtaking Study of Vermeer,"This revised and enlarged edition is an unusually thoughtful, intelligent and eloquent offering from a scholar of remarkable insight and rare passion. Until I read the book (in one night as I couldn't put it down), I didn't know why I had always liked Vermeer. Dr. Snow's book is a journey of pleasure and discovery. Light, space, colour, desire and luminous revelation fairly crackle with intensity. An historic contribution to the art world, or as Dore Ashton observed, ""an authentic contribution to the literature (yes, literature!) of the visual arts""."
1,Barking Up The Wrong Tree...,"This book reminds me of Rolling Stone magazine style rock music criticism in which the lyrics are discussed ad nauseum and the music is barely mentioned. Snow has no feel for painting or visual values. The book begins with his reactions to ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" which are a preposterous mish-mash of psychological nonsense. One has to feel sorry for someone with so little sensitivity to beauty.""Everyone wants to understand art. Why not try to understand the song of a bird? ...people who try to explain pictures are usually barking up the wrong tree.""-Picasso""I'd give the whole of Italian painting for Vermeer of Delft. There's a painter who simply said what he had to say without bothering about anything else.""-Picasso"
3,"Good intensity, poor execution","I have to say that I was very disappointed with this video. In my opinion, Tracey is not a high level instructor. Her cueing is awful. She doesn't explain much, she cues at the very last minute and her execution is not very good in kickboxing. I can't say for her other videos. The dubbing on this workout is terrible...I am an avid kickboxing enthusiast. My favorite instructor is Janis Saffell. Tracey is not even comprable to her. Janis cues very well and explains what she is doing. The positive aspect of this dvd, is that you do break a sweat, so in that respect, I wouldn't disregard it completely. However, had I known, I probably would not have bought this dvd..."
4,great music. good thinking!,"the music is far out. light tribal and afro beat. i only wish for every d.j. that releases a mixed set, to follow this path and release a singles box that containes all the tracks in a single format!"
1,Like reading a high school essay,"I had to purchase this book for a class I was taking. The writing style seemed juvenile in my opinion, and the author's supposed revelations were practically common knowledge. Further more, a book that should have been objectively written (it is passed off as being an unbiased study)appeared to me to have a clear agenda. As a side note, the rest of my class likewise seemed to independently reach this conclusion."
5,Produces great bubbles.,I use this in a 75 gallon freshwater setup and it works perfectly. I put it under the substrate for a different look and it has stayed buried and produces bubbles along the entire length.
3,Didn't work as I had expected,I expected the bubbles to be of more varied size but all of the bubbles this thing emits are super tiny 'fizzy' bubbles.I was hoping for larger bubbles like some of the bubble stones that I own. no such luck.
1,Buffalo Bill: Showman of the West,"I purchased this DVD and when I tried to play it on my TV via my Philips DVD 711 DVD player, I found it impossible to play it. It was a total waste of money. I have had no trouble with other DVDs, only this one."
5,Experience the triumph of the human spirit!,"Mr. Norman did an excellent job of relating the unimaginable horrors of the Vietnamese prison system. The prisoners will come to life as you learn of their collective and individual exploits. These men are the true definition of what a hero is, though they think of themselves as ""just doing my job"" This book is a must-read for the inspirational story fan."
5,Excellent Story from the Prisoner's Point of View,"I found this book to be very captivating and informative. The author allows the reader to experience imprisonment through the eyes of the POW. I read this book because I was born after the war and did not know anything about it...I have more respect for the people that actually lived through it now, and I think it has done me more good than if I would have read a book dealing with all the political viewpoints from someone who was not there. Could not put it down, very inspiring."
4,A witty mystery,"The year is 1979 and Don Strachey is hired by a wealthy couple to find their son Billy. Billy is wanted for murder, and since both he and Strachey are gay, the detective must have some ideas as to where the young man has fled. Of course, because all gays know each other, right? Soon Strachey is drawn into a complex puzzle as he becomes determined to prove Billy's innocence. Now if he could just find the young man before it's too late. In this lively mystery, Stevenson introduces his plucky detective and spins a great tale that belies the social commentary contained within. ""Death Trick"" is not only a great example of the mystery genre, but also a compelling slice of gay literary history."
4,The gay storyline blends well with the telling of the events,"around a murder. I like the angst that Donald feels when he becomes involved with a central figure in his case. The patronizing parents are a good, but overdone touch. In all, it is a pleasant read."
2,Watered-down cocktails at the Orbit Lounge,"With the exception of a few tracks, this lame collection of laid-back electronic beats doesn't live up to Shadow Records' fine reputation. Apparently, other labels have snapped up all the good lounge tracks, leaving them (and us) with this mediocre assortment. ""Hi-Fidelity Lounge"" on Guidance and ""Om Lounge"" (1,2 &3) are a few discs with much better material. The bottom line - if you happen by the Orbit Lounge, keep walking!"
3,Gundam seed BGM CD 1,"Here's a review by a Gundam fan for Gundam fans.This CD contains back ground music from Sunrise's latest Gundam show; Mobile suit Gundam Seed.There are 30 tracks in all, most of witch are just a little more than a minute each.This does NOT include the opening theme ""Invoke"" by T.M. Revolution.There are a lot more BGM then I thought in this serie and this CD covers only the first 12 episodes.A must for all fans of this serie, but incomplete without all upcoming Gundam Seed sountracks."
3,"Guilt, A good lawyer of a bad man","I have to say that English is not my first language but I found in Guilt a writting easy to read. Even do with a good quantity of law technical words. The first part of the book I found it ""slow"" after some pages I still asked what is the subject or the point of the book? After thinking How would be a real situations and escenarios like the author tray to show, It was hard to imagine some of them. Also did not tell many things and circunstances and let them to our imagination (which is normal in books), perhaps details of normal (real) life. But still let basic situations unshowed. Any way a good one with lawyers, trails, witness, detectives and so, Its OK for a quick trip."
2,It just didn't work for me. . .,"I read this book last night. While I found the plot compelling, I would have to do a lot more than just suspend all my belief systems to buy into the author's story of greed, amoral behavior and utter coldness.Why didn't the author explore more of Dooher's dark side...like, at the funeral, nothing is discussed about the cause of the bitter estrangement between him and his children. Nothing was ever discussed about Mark's knowledge -- or lack thereof -- of Sheila's anti-depressant habit.I was also puzzled as to Wes Farrell's absolute loyalty to his best friend. I have a wonderful best friend, but I don't turn a blind eye to her faults like Wes did to Mark's. It seems to me that the only person in Mark Dooher's circle of friends that couldn actually see his dark side was Sam and she had only known him a short time when she figured it all out.I was disappointed in this book and am curious as to how so many others found it so wonderful. Oh, well."
5,Loved it. Worth the time.,I didn't have any idea of what to expect with this novel. It was laying around so I read it. I was blown away. I didn't care that it took almost 300 pages to find it's true course. I was hooked by the characters. I loved the fact that they made you wonder about Mark's innocence. Truly worth the time.
1,"No offense John Lescroart, but this was not good","This book was absolutely horrible! It took me months to get into it. It was very predictable. To me, the worst thing about this book was the editing. There were grammatical and typographical errors all over the place. I thought that the errors would stop. Instead, they just went on and on. I also thought at the beginning, ""Yes, an author that does not think he has to use profanity with every other sentence."" I soon found out that there was profanity laced throughout the story that simply did not need to be there. The Editors of this book should be fired! (sorry kids) It's obvious they did not read the book!"
4,Great Mindless Thriller,"This was a very fun and painless read, which is just what you expect books like this to be, so I definitely recommend it. It was as soothing and unchallenging as an episode of Law and Order. There was a villain you could feel very good about wanting to get caught-he was so evil you really wanted him to be, too. And it's always fun reading about the crimes of an honestly wretched character.The best thing about this book is that its hero was memorable, which is pretty rare with these sorts of thrillers. Abe Glitsky-half-black, half-Jewish, hardened police detective of San Francisco-is really likable and unique. That's definitely the key to making a successful franchise-creating a recurring character people like. So, please buy this book and dive in, it's perfect for the airplane, train ride, or whatever other thing you have to do that you'll need to be distracted from."
3,too easy,From the start you wonder about the main character Mark. He's too good and the way he is read by the audio artist he comes off as a pretty nice guy. Short for suspect him. You see him rigging the situation because of his love of a woman. Then I spend the rest of the book wondering how he will get caught. Abe Glitsky's story overwhelms the story of Mark. Lescroat has written better stories that are less predictable. tom the bread baker
3,"A likeable read, about an unlikable guy","Slow starting novel that hums along easily enough to wait out those first 100 or so pages. We then get the meat of the story and the book becomes hard to put down. Mark Dooher is a compelling figure, the classic clash of ""what you see"" vs.""what you get"". A few missing details and an ending that drips on too long keep this novel from being more than just a decent read."
3,Pretty good...But Lescroart can do better,"This book was pretty good, but the first half was very SLOW. I didn't get into it until Sheila Dooher was killed---even then I had a hard time believing Mark Dooher could be so two faced. Lescroart did not develop Mark's character well enough to the point where the reader could understand his *dark* side. Nor did he explain why *having* Christina Carrera was so important. I suppose the story does bring up the question, do we really know anyone? Is anyone really who they say they are? I still think the 13th Juror is Lescroart's best work. That is a novel that is truly shocking! I would suggest the 13th Juror over Guilt any day."
2,good only to kill time on an airplane,"I bought this book to kill time on an airplane and it accomplished the task. It doesn't require much thought and it reads fast. As a courtroom drama, it is only fair. As a suspense novel, there is very little suspense. I felt like I was in the midst of a soap opera made up of very unbelievable characters. I will not read any more of this author's work unless I have need to kill time on another plane ride."
2,"eh, not what i expected.","i guess if you never went through grade school in the US this would be a good book for you but it was certainly useless for me. i give it two stars as opposed to one, because the content of the book is good if it is exactly what you are looking for."
5,Scrubbing Pads,This is a very good product. It does an excellent job of scrubbing the tub enclosure and rinses clean.
5,Worth every penny!,"Mr. Clean Magic Reach Scrubbing Tub and Shower Pads 8 refill padsThe tub my husband uses is always heavily coated with grime. These cut through the grime with ease allowing me to clean it without as much bending and reaching. Also, we have really hard water and these cut through the hard water buildup on my shower. It takes a little more elbow grease for the hard water stains, but it's the best cleaner I've used. I don't use the handle thingie as I find it awkward, but that's not the part that does the cleaning, anyway!"
3,Sharon's opinion pole,It was to expensive for what I received. I will probably have to throw the Mr Clean scrubber away. I cannot afford this. I love it but the price is outrageous
3,Convenient cleaning,"I find these pads very convenient and effective. I use them not only for the bathroom tiles and surfaces, but they do a great job on the gunk that builds up on the kitchen vent, which I can reach and clean with the pad on the Magic Reach tool.The only reason they don't get a higher rating is the fact that they only last one cleaning. I would prefer if one could buy the cleaner and the pads were reusable."
1,Did Mr Clean change this product???,I was so excited to finally find these refills again....only to discover they don't magically foam anymore! As a matter of fact they didn't have any cleaner on them at all. So I ask you all this: Was I sold a defective batch or did Mr Clean ruin a perfectly awesome product??
5,Mr. Clean Magic Reach Shower and Tub Pads,"It is an excellent product; however, I cannot find it any more in the stores. This is not good to have to order and pay for shipping everytime I need them. Why did this product have to be changed like this?"
2,too expensive,The Magic Reach Scrubbing pads work fine. I miss read the amount I was buying when I placed the order. When I read 8 refill packs I thought it was for 8 refill PACKS. Because of my mistake I paid way too much for this product.
5,"Simply Incredible, fantastic sofware for beginner and pro","Especially for the beginner, now you can have a rhythm section to back you up. You can change the key, follow the notes on screen, change tempo. And your accompaniment never tires, always is on the beat, and always in tune. This is extremely valuable for anyone learning jazz. This is probably the best single investment that a jazz student could make."
4,Almost a 5 Star purchase!,"I recieved this Band in a Box from my husband for Christmas. I had been introduced to it at the college during a Jazz Combo class I am taking. It seemed like it would be very helpful for learning to solo and things of that nature.I find that there are TONS of things in the program that I can't understand how to use. I have read the manual for specific things to try to do and the manual isn't very reader friendly.I find the program to be very entertaining though, and I am glad we got it."
5,A Great Program,"Band in a Box has everything my husband needs for the music he uses in different music programs, he really loves it. The only problem he has with it is that it is difficult to learn how to get the combinations of back up tracks he needs. But it has all the equipment for groups and the different back up tracks. After he figures out how to make it do all the things he wants it to do, we will be ordering more up grades for it. He thinks it is a fantstic program for musicians from beginners and professionals."
4,A Great Read,An unpredictable Trinidad romance with a lot of twist and suspense. I can't wait to read more of Carrington's books.
2,Didn't do anything for me.,"I did not find this book useful, but to be fair I wasn't entirely sure what I was looking for. I was hoping it would help me to remove myself from a lot of the negative dreams I have been used to having and I would have liked to have found some help in it to get me dreaming better, but it didn't work for me."
2,curious book,"Because the author questions whether the unconscious exists I question whether she knows what she is tallking about. The book delves into waters much of which the author reports about second hand (then why doesn't she question if what she reports second hand exists?). Much in the book is interesting, much is questionable. Questionable how useful also. While the author makes many suggestions after each section of the book, the book isn't very practicable; a lot of steps are missing. I personally found it objectionable how the author seems to boast of her fantastic abilities to dream. One rapidly grows tired of that sort of reporting. There are a lot of better and more useful books on dreaming than this one."
2,only 1/4 of order,"The way this item was advertized is as all four support towers and both laod bars, what I received was two support towers and the end caps to the load bars...the load bars that are not included. After receiving this item I found everything is sold separately"
2,Depressing and Pessimistic,I bought this book for inspiration on how to help my lower back/leg pain from a herniated disc. Instead it pretty much told me that I had no chance to improve without surgery and just surrender. It was a pessimistic book. do not get it....seemed outdated as well....pictures of exercises were confusing.
4,Works well but setup definitely needs work,This product is certified to work with only a few printers. The list is on NetGear's site. I tried to make it work with my Lexmark x2350ve(Color All in One). Failed miserably and tech support politely declined any further help. Then tried with Samsung ML-2010. Still did not work. Then read FAQ online and found out that Win XP SP2 interferes with setup so disabled that and now it works just fine. Pls remember to download the latest setup wizard from NetGear otherwise you will not get all the tools. All in all a good product but the 10-15 minute setup is not.
4,a pleasant surprise,"I was a litte concerned after reading a few negative review. But, it was $10 AR, so I went ahead. The installation was not exactly smooth sailing (30 minutes). Once installed, it worked fine. I also found out that you do not need to set up a home network group to use the printer server. I can even print from my work laptop to the printer server. A pleasant surprise."
1,MAC users beware,Netgear does not provide free warranty phone support (1st 90 days) for MAC users.You will need to pay to get phone support to help set this up.The CD software only works on PCs.SummaryNo support for MAC. Poor documentation.I was able to get it up and running in a couple of hours for my PC.
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7!,"Just as the title states, this print server will not work with Windows 7. I couldn't even make it through the setup wizard without having to plug the printer in directly to my computer and install the drivers that way. Then, the setup wizard would finally finish, and it would allow me to print a test page. I still can't print anything at all. I've talked with technical support, followed directions I've found on the internet, and nothing works. And from what I gather, Netgear has no intention at all of ever making this piece compatible with Windows 7. Save your money."
1,"Bad product, poor customer service","I have worked with PCs since 1985 and I could not get this print server to work after many hours of trying. There is no point in explaining my experience, it simply should not be this difficult"
4,Netgear PS121 print server,It works great for printing. I would have given it 5 stars except that the fax and scan functions don't work with the Panasonic KXFLB811 I have attached to it from network PCs.
1,Would not work with my system,This product was a disaster. I hate is when you spend a few hours trying to figure out how to make a product work land find in the end it is incompatible with your system. I sent this one back for a credit - waste of at least 3 hours of my time.
2,Finally got it to work with my Mac!,"My dad bought it so that we (2 PC's and a Mac) could all share 1 printer (HP OfficeJet 5610). It was easy enough to install it on the PC's, but the Mac was impossible. The documentation was incorrect, the CD was useless and Netgear's technical support was a joke. I called them and was told that it was an Apple problem and I should call Apple. Then I emailed Tech Support and they replied but what they told me did not work. Finally I added my printer as an IP printer, using HP JetDirect as the Protocol and entered the IP address and chose my driver and the test page printed!"
1,The good reviews must be by shills; mine is junk.,"Completely unreliable. Printing is hit and miss. More miss than hit. And I need reliability. EVERY print job comes back with a ""failed to print"" message, whether it prints or not. When jobs do go through they are agonizingly slow. If I owned a gun I'd use it for target practice; it's that aggravating.Installing the printer driver on the remote computers is a pain - do it over and over until it decides the time is right. It was loaded and kind'a working on one laptop, but has simply stopped and won't be reloaded. Called Netgear about a different piece of equipment and the experience was so bad I refuse to call them again. All the guy could say was it's 'software and the software is out of warranty.' I didn't fight 'em; trashed it and bought Linksys. Now I'm going to trash this ""thing"" and see what Linksys has for print servers. Do NOT waste your money."
1,2 Days wasted trying to install,"I bought this PS121 (new) on the web (not from Amazon) and spend two days trying to get it to work....nada ...zilch.. I work for a computer company and consider myself pretty good with networking, computers, etc. but this thing drove me nuts...it must be defective (why are they selling so many reconditioned units ???). I could ping the address, but could not get the Wizard to see it, nor install the port. You should be able to use the diagonistics button to print a sample test page, but that did not work with two different printers. I called India, but they could not help. Going back or in the trash."
1,I gave up after two hours,"My old SMC Barricade Router/Wireless Access Point/Print Server died on me after seven years of faithful service.I replaced the Barricade with a Netgear WGR614 Wireless-g Router and a PS121 Print Server. The Router set up and worked flawlessly. The PS121 is another story.I inserted the setup CD and it ran through most of the setup steps without a hitch -- then -- it came to the point where the setup routine said ""Installing Software."" The progress indicator quickly ran up to about 95 percent installed -- then stopped. And it remained stopped for two hours. I pulled everything loose and started from scratch. Same result.I'm returning the PS121 to the dealer tomorrow and will try to find a new SMC Barricade router -- it has a built-in print server which is a true print server, not just a fancy USB hub."
3,"Great compatibility, does not last a year","I've had two of these USB print servers in the last 18 months, and although they are compatible with a good range of printers, and relatively easy to set up, they die very quickly. The first time I had the print server it died after about 9 months of being always on (although rarely in use). I originally thought it was my printer, but later found it was the print server. I couldn't replace it, because I didn't have the receipt anymore, so I purchased a replacement, thinking it was just a one-time issue. Now, after another 8-9 months of being on 24/7, it has died again. But this time I saved my receipt and the box, so I can hopefully get a replacement from the company, since they have a 1 year warranty."
4,"Convenience, plan and simple","This is a great product for both Windows and Linux machines. I've been using my Linux box as a print server for my network for several years, but this is so much easier. In Linux I use it as a ""Networked UNIX (LPD)"" printer; the Server is the IP address you assign it from your router, and the Queue is the ""Serve Name"" found on the ""Server Status"" tab of the web page of this device; you can also find it's IP address there. Once you get it set up, it's really awesome!My only reason for not giving it a 5 is that there seems to be some sensitivity to the order in which you connect things. I find cat5, then power, then printer works without a problem; however, other orders probably work as well."
1,Don't buy this product,"Every time I look at this overpriced piece of junk on my desk it makes me upset that I ever bought it.To cut to the chase: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When I was in the market for a print server I wanted something that would be reliable and always work; this product isn't it."
2,"Mac Owners, Look Elsewhere","I purchased this print server only to end up returning it because it was too much of a hassle to make it work on my all-Macintosh network. Although technically it *is* Mac compatible, it requires the use of a Windows computer for the initial setup, which in my book might as well be Mac incompatible. I replaced this with the similar USB 2.0 print server from Buffalo Technologies and I was up and running (using OS X Tiger, Rendezvous and AppleTalk) within 15 minutes of receiving the Amazon package at my front door. PS: Netgear elects NOT to include an Ethernet cable in the box whereas Buffalo not only includes one, but it's a super-slick, long and ultra flat Ethernet cable, all for about the same price as the Netgear."
1,Netgear Junk,Do not even bother buying this thing the software that comes with it is totally unreliable!This thing is a total waste of time and money!A one star rating for this thing is generous.
2,Slow,I've had this on my network for the past year or so and it is very slow in time to spool and print.
2,My Print Server would stop working every two to three weeks...,"Like the guy said above.. ""But then my Print Server would stop working every two to three weeks"" exactlly the same thing here, and we bought three of these. The ps110 and two of these, ALL the netgear print servers would work ok.. for about 2-3 weeks then I would have to 'reboot' the device. Sometimes this worked others it didnt. This is not a good product. Also like another guy said above we have had an HP print server, the Hewlett-Packard HP JetDirect 175X, for years and has worked flawlessly."
1,only 1 problem with the PS121...,"It doesn't work. I spent 3 days trying but it just doesn't work. I have a an Epson R200 printer and I run Windows XP. Probably my fault it doesn't work? Nope... I purchased a Linksys WPS54G and 10 minutes after I had it out of the box it worked. All 3 of my computers print just fine now. Netgear support is worthless. Yes, I tried turning off my firewall... turning off Epson print monitoring, disabled bidirectional support, different spooling options bla bla bla... the thing does not work. Do yourself a favor... spend the extra $40 or so and buy the WPS54G. The wireless ability of the WPS54G is cool since I can put my printer anyway in the house now..."
1,"This whole thing was pretty much a ""bust""!","Never have got this product to work. No documentation sent with product. Website for Netgear was confusing, as two different products are posted and there are no markings on the delivered product to tell me which product I have. Could not get telephone support from Netgear due to serial # being marked through due to reconditioned product. This whole thing was pretty much a ""bust""!"
1,Worked Great with XP. Watch out with Windows 7,"This product has remained in a drawer since I brought it home. It did not work with Windows 7 and Netgear did not appear to be working on fixing new drivers. Multiple posting on the net proved I was not the only one with this problem and complaint. Recently, some people have begun to post encouraging solutions, so I will try those next. If they work, I still won't change my review because Netgear seemed deaf to the problem for so long."
2,Finicky setup and unreliable long-term operation,"Unfortunately, we did not have the best experience with this product. Initial setup was tricky, requiring the device to be unplugged/replugged, disconnected/reconnected several times before it was visible on the network.Once installed and working, it mysteriously stopped working in about a week. Print requests would error out with 'device is busy.' If we then unplugged/disconnected the device, then replugged and reconnected it, the pages would print out. Made no sense.We switched to the Zonet product and have not had any of these issues."
2,"easy installation, but stop working after 4 months","I bought this print server back in December 2005. I used it with my All-in-One Brother printer MFC-4800. The installation was easy. It worked great......for 4 months. Then...then... it just stoped working after 4 months. I tried to disconnect and reconnect the power, Ethernet cable etc...nothing helped.May be I just got a bad product."
2,Super simple till you run into a problem,"I bought the print server and followed the super simple directions and no luck. I was trying to attach to an Epson printer that was neither on the supported nor the will not work with lists. After many hours of trying different settings I got the thing to work. In depth manuals and self support tech support are non-existent. The unit worked with out problems for the last couple of months till I unplugged it to move it to another outlet. Now all I can do is get it to print the first couple of lines and then it hangs and has to be unplugged to get it to respond again. I've tried emailing support with no respond and I have tried calling support and after wading through a very long automated menu, the system told me that I had twenty minute plus wait and then after a few minutes hung up. So my review is buyer beware! It may work right out of the box, but if it doesn't don't expect any help from the documentation or live support."
1,Setup Is Complex,"It took me ages to get this product set up, the set up modules are cumbersome and didn't work out of the box.If you are not savvy around configuring TCP/IP services on your home or small office router choose something else!"
1,Works great between frequent crashes,"I purchased this Netgear print server based on my experience with their enterprise line (big mistake). The Netgear print server was easily setup and configured with the printer (OkiData 6100 Laser Printer), and I configured the computers on my network to print via the print server. The problem arose when the computers would lose contact with the print server. The only way to get the thing back was to pull the power cord on the print server, wait a few seconds and then plug it back in. After the print server rebooted, it worked fine again. This happened once or more per day which is totally unacceptable to me. If something can't work for months (or more!) between failures/crashes, then I am not interested.Over-all a lesson learned: Only buy blue (enterprise tier) Netgear equipment."
3,Ordered a Print server got a network usb hub,"If you want a real printserver that suports spooling and those features, then I recommend you to buy a REAL printserver.What this is is basically a USB hub that runs over ethernet and you get an application that binds your computer to the hub when you ""reserve"" the printer (which means that the name print server is incorrect for this product).One cool thing I did was to connect another USB hub to this thing and I could have a Mass storage device and a printer remote.Good for a 1 computer enviroment, but bad if you want a real printserver."
1,"Piece of junk, backed by the WORST customer service in the industry","Do NOT buy this product. I have used several wired print servers before, ALL without problem, THIS is the only one I have ever come across that doesn't work well. The print driver repeatedly goes to ""sleep"" and may or may not wake to print. FORGET about Netgears customer service, unless you like wasting your time. Netgear's policy is, the first THREE responses will be canned ones that have NOTHING to do with your issue, then they bump it to ""level 2"" who then proceed to waste AT LEAST another week providing more canned responses that indicate they have no idea what they are doing and no training. Well, at least Netgear employs people in 3rd world toilets so they won't have to starve. Buy a different product, this is junk."
3,"Not easy to setup, but easy to maintain.","Once setup the system works well. I'm using it on a USB printer in an office setting for one of our printers. To allow a new user to print on this printer we need to install the printer locally, and then change the port settings to allow the user access... its ""OK"" but probably not a turn key solution for anyone without a decent amount of IT experience."
1,Of no use,Cannot get this device to work with Windows 7. I guess it us just too old and the drivers are incompatible.
2,Check Compatibility Beforehand,"I installed a new HP all-in-one inkjet and then attempted to install the Netgear PS121. What a mess! Seemed like I almost made it through installation... then hit a brick wall. Waited for 40 minutes to talk to a nice gentleman in India who tried helping for 30 minutes before announcing that it wasn't compatible with the HP printer. In the process it sabotaged the printer drivers, so I had to uninstall the Netgear software and re-install the printer - in that order to make it work. Side note: Windows Vista made installing the printer an ordeal. I wish I'd waited a while before getting Vista."
4,Rural awakenings rarely more poignant,"Short & sweet - I loved this book. A throwback to the time when innocence was a wonderful thing when you were a boy growing up, until you hit dreaded puberty! AND, confounding that - you like boys! Strong on narrative, never twee; growing up on a farm was never more accurately portrayed. Aitken's descriptions of Billy's infatuation with a farm worker and sneaky goings-on with a mate are spot on. One warning - don't watch the movie first. It'll spoil the book for you. The casting director should go back to casting school!"
3,timex watch,a little bit small.the light can not been seen at night.looking for another watch?dark face is to dark.will buy white face next.
4,This disc is a very nice surprise...,"I ordered this because I love jazz, especially with a Hammond organ in the mix, and especially the funky kind of jazz. I did not know about this group, but the samples sounded good so I took the plunge.Wow! I don't know where these guys came from, but they can play! This is a great disc! I couldn't give it five stars since ""Peaches En Regalia"" was just too short! But it is well worth the money. They should be wider known in the jazz cirles after this disc."
3,Didnt use much,workouts weren't the best on knees if you dont use proper body mechanics and was very old in its approach
3,hard to suspend disbelief,"Mr. Grossman is a fluid writer with a polished style, but I was disconcerted by errors of fact and setting. The prewar apartment of the mysterious Went family - building, doorman, view, everything - is totally unbelieveable, at least to anyone who knows the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Later in the novel the main character drives north from Manhattan through a landscape that nobody who lives here has ever seen. He eventually crosses the Hudson and watches the sun set in the east, no mean trick. There's a big setup with the ominous parallel plot of the computer game MOMUS, but no payoff. The passages about rare books are fascinating, but given the errors elsewhere I wondered if they were accurate."
2,Not For Me,"Very strange book -- just when I'm getting interested and the plot seems to move, it bogs down but I kept plugging along. Edward Wozny is a very unsympathetic character, as is everyone in the book. I did learn some things about old books, but that wasn't enough to make up for the letdown ending. Just not my type of book."
1,well..,"I read it and it was painful. The only thoughts that saved me were:1.) proof that critics are critics because they can't write (wow, now I'm a critic, what happens if you are a critic of a critic who can't write?)2.) I was hoping that Patrick Bateman from the wonderful book ""American Psycho"" was going to pop up and gut all the charaters in this book. But even that would have been bad, since when he cut them open he'd only find ... nothing."
2,Would you hire an investment banker as research librarian?,"I really wish major publishing houses (ALL publishing houses) would have tests of reality perceptions for their authors, even if one is the book critic for TIME. Thus, the principle pretext of this book -- that a 25 year old investment whiz kid would be hired to uncrate and research a valuable library of rare books --someone, presumably, who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing-- is untenable from the getgo. I think the author was watching a dvd of The Lawnmower Man whilst contriving this oddly unconvincing tale of computer games and medieval codices. I live and read in London and I have met one or two duchesses myself. Believe me, no one above the level of a Cornwell crabber would hire Edward Wozny to even touch one of their books let alone entrust an entire library to him. This will become a film, no doubt...hopefully with the very talented Adam Sandler in the lead. That way, we can be in on the joke from the beginning."
2,Three Quarters interesting,"I agree with another reviewer that his was a great read for about 3/4 of the book. Then you think, ""The author must be planning a sequel. Right?"" Only to find out that No, there are only a few pages left and no sequel. Very unsatisfying. It doesn't have to be a resolved ending... just better.. so many details left out."
4,Highly entertaining!,"I went through this book in nothing flat, mostly because I couldn't stop reading! The mystery here is set up well, and the writing is superb. I knew the game in this story was tied to the search for the codex and was pleasantly surprised to find out how. I don't want to give anything away, so you'll have to read it yourself to find out how. You definitely won't be disappointed in this one."
4,Solid literary thriller,"Much more clever (and better written) than the DaVinci Code but not as dense as Umberto Eco, Codex weaves Edward Wozny's search for a missing book together with his obsession with an interactive computer game. I liked the slightly snarky characters and anti-climatic ending, which I found refreshingly realistic. It's nice to read something that doesn't tie up every loose end neatly. The only part I thought was weak enough to detract from the plot--and it's a pretty big detraction, IMO--was the precipitating event that was driving the frantic search for the manuscript...as if it would really matter in modern day society.This is the kind of book, with the kind of flaws, that makes me hopeful that Grossman's next novel will be a 5 star read."
2,Not nearly as good as the Da Vinci Code,"The book starts off quite intriging, with Edward Wozny roped into working for the Wents in their old library. He is asked to look for a ancient volume referred to as a codex.He also gets hooked on a cult computer game; MOMUS, But for me, the sub plot of the MOMUS computer game does not tie in at all with Wozny's search in the Wents'library.Wozny is at a cross-road in his life, where he is soon to take up a new job in London but he seems to have lost all his focus on his career, partly because of the Codex & MOMUS.Where the book should increase in tension and pace, it slows down with more library searching! And ultimately it has an awful ending, the climax, when he returns the Codex to its desperate owner only to find that they DON'T WANT IT!POOR"
1,Truly awful,"I am now wondering why I wasted 45 minutes on this thing. The plot(s) are laughable; the characters wooden, there is a sprinkling of quite implausible sexual allusions and attractions garnished with yuppie brand and product placement. I wonder why I got beyond ten pages of this drivel, and then remember that I wanted to find out if the whole book was quite as bad as the opening chapter. It is."
2,"""Cerebral Thriller?"" Only if you've just had a pan-galactic gargleblaster!","I was really looking forward to ""Codex"" because of all the advance praise I read. I read reviews that claimed this was an intellectual thriller on a par with Eco and Iain Pears' later novels.Oh well. Grossman has a garbled plot that leaves the reader holding a bit of twine at the end, wondering where the story disappeared to. The characters are flat, but even worse, the story leads nowhere with nary a red-herring to get in the way. Caveat emptor!"
2,What a letdown,"I'll be honest, I flew through this book (unfortunately recommended off of the Rule of Four - which is much better) - I was pretty stoked to see how the hell MOMUS was going to link in, and what exactly the mystery behind the CODEX would unravel. And then there were fifty pages left. And then I started getting worried. And then the ending just flat out sucked instigating a vocal expletive as I closed the book. Completely turned my opinion sour - and I'm embarrassed to let a friend know who was going to borrow it based upon my initial reaction that I uh...lost the book...hopefully to never be found."
2,"Yeah, the ending was a let down.","SPOILER ALERTI thought the biggest flaw in this book is that it never answered the question why, if this book is so dangerous to the Duke's family, didn't they simply destroy this book centuries ago.My second biggest grip with the book is that the reader never finds out whether Margaret was working for the Duke from Day One, or whether she somehow suddenly switched sides. If we take Margaret's character as a scholar seriously, her natural ally would be the Duchess, rather than the Duke, because the Duchess wants the manuscript to be published and become well known, while the Duke wants to suppress it.I actually liked most of the book, it just needed a better ending."
2,Have I missed something,"Have I missed something?What a let down. The books cover reviews should be against the trades descriptions act. The basic idea of a 14th century mystery and even some supernatural connection with a virtual reality game could have yielded a great novel. But it didn't. There are no explanations of a lot of the key plot twists. Maybe I missed the hidden message. I admit I couldn't put it down, but only in the hope it was about to improve. I felt very let down by the end, which as others have said seamed to have been written because the author ran out of pages.If you are considering buying this book don't. Go to the Library (you may see the key characters!) first. If you intend reading the book don't read on.[...]I was left wondering if I took the second word of each page and jumbled them up, maybe I would find an hidden meaning in Lev's own CODEX."
4,Pretty good weekend book,"This book came highly recommended to me. I did not, however, find it to be the ""great"" book it was supposed to be. Having said that, it was an enormously enjoyable piece of escapism, and I can highly recommend it as such. The writing is excellent -- actually beautiful in some places. I imagine we will see some fine future books by Grossman. I, too, found the ending to be a bit abrupt -- and the computer game did seem a bit off subject. But I actually think both the end, and the game, play an integral part in the story. I don't want to say too much, because I don't want to spoil this lovely story about the search for a missing 14th century manuscript. It is a fantastic mystery. For the sake of argument with those who objected, however, I will say this (and hopefully it will only make sense to those people, and will not give away the story): Think about disposability -- and think about easter eggs. It really does connect with the entire story.I do recommend this book."
2,Contrived,"Contrived--one word perfectly sums up this novel. Why do the characters do anything? I don't know. Sometimes the author tries to give them some motivation, but it never holds water (the big secret is that 600 years ago there was a bastard in an aristocratic English family--wow! talk about front page headlines). We are told time and again that the actions described MATTER, but it is never backed up. I've given it two stars because the writing is competent, but there is nothing here that is important."
1,Not the Least Bit Engaging,"CODEX is being marketed as a thriller, which is a shame, because it's not really meant to be one. Instead, this is an literary novel by the 35-year old book critic for TIME magazine. If you're looking for excitement and fast-paced suspense, you won't get it with this book in any way, shape, or form.This novel has little going for it. The plot of CODEX is nominal, the characters are uninteresting, and the medieval subject matter is dry, The prose is very decent, but tends to meander from page to page, with no clear direction in mind. In the end, I simply couldn't finish this book. From what I understand from the other reviews, the ending of this novel is terrible, so I don't regret giving up on this one.My advice is to skip this book unless you have a strong interest in medieval history."
2,No Code(x) Required,"Easy to read from start to finish; requiring little thought. Characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed - perfect for summer reading. A pleasant time-killer but not as rewarding as, say, stamp collecting. The author should be faintly embarrassed."
5,Totally cool book,"I found this book completely fascinating. What Lev Grossman has done--comparing the rise of gaming culture to the evolution of reading for pleasure--is thoroughly insightful and entertaining. I've never read a smarter, cooler book. And I thought the ending was totally perfect. I think it may be the kind of ending that people resent because they don't see it coming. I'm no expert, but maybe all the readers who have been complaining about the ending just didn't get the book? Maybe they should have read a bit closer? I can't wait for this author's next book."
2,"A ""DOUBLE-HELIX"" THAT FAILS TO CONVINCE","I found this an irritating book, which failed to live up to its promise. It operates on two levels; the real-life search for the Codex of the title, and the parallel universe of a computer game. They fail to mesh satisfactorily, although clearly they are intended to do so. The characters themselves are unconvincing, particularly the hot-shot hero who spends half his time in a state of exhaustion. The plot is based on two hypotheses; first, that members of the English landed gentry are fabulously wealthy and powerful, secondly that news of bastardy in the ancestral line would undermine the holder of the title. Both are patently absurd. Added to which, the text contains a number of solecisms which really should have been spotted and weeded out."
3,Good story; could be better written,"I tried to like this book. I really really did. Especially since it was a book in the genre of novels that I enjoy so much. Namely a book that has some fact mixed in with a bit of fiction. But if this is a novel which by all rights I should have liked, then why not a higher rating?Simply put, the writing style in this novel was very difficult to get through. Unlike other novels which focus on blurring the line between truth and fiction, there was no flow to the way the author went about the story. Are we trying to feel sorry or relate to the major protagonist in this story? Or are we to focus instead on his quest to find the Codex? Will he abandon his 'life plan', or won't he? I found all of these questions to be a big distraction from the books main plan - find the Codex.Overall though the book was fairly enjoyable, and for anyone who enjoys a good truth or fiction novel, then this book is for you. Just don't expect a big page turner."
3,Almost great,"This could have been a fantastic novel but the story completely fell apart at the end. The author drops several plot lines and the book ends very abruptly. I was really into the story and couldn't wait to get to the end but the ending was terrible and left too many hanging questions. If this book had had a great ending, it would be right up there with anything by Arturo Perez-Reverte."
1,Worthless Book,"This book was such a disappointment. It was weak on plot. The characters were poorly developed and the character interaction was awkward and stilted. I loved the idea of a novel that revolved around books and lovers of books, but the plot was often nonsensical and at best poorly constructed. And, I won't even get into the weird sub-plot of the video game that seemed to be completely irrelevant except maybe as something to fill space. The book, especially toward the end, was long on overly-detailed descriptions of minutia. I kept wishing the author would just hurry up and put the story out of it's misery. I just wish the author had spent some of that effort on plot and character development instead."
2,Relationships between characters not believable,"Whether the relationship between characters was business, friendship, or lovers, the connection between the characters did not make sense. If was full of opposites attracting. I also did not like the connection between the video game and the hunt for literature."
2,Where's the rest of the story?,"I enjoyed the book until I got to the end. Like many reviewers I went back and reread several pages to see if I had missed something. I had not. I got the same feeling as when watched the second ""Star Wars"". There must be a part two coming. I won't be reading it."
2,"Promising, disappointing but not completely useless","It starts as a promise of an exceedingly clever literary thriller only to tumble over by the midpoint and to ultimately fall sadly short of the plot's great potential. The initial plot idea is great - an old medieval codex, the existence of which is not certain, is pursuit by two young people in modern times. There is so much expectation, but unfortunately as the novel unfolds there are too many inconsistencies (e.g. in terms of time frame) and logical errors (e.g. Why exactly Duke would be destroyed if Codex became public?) to enjoy it. I won't argue that the book is intelligent, but the plot twists were absolutely nonsensical. Not believable characters did not believable things that were so far-fetched that makes you wonder how Lev Grossman couldn't have seen it himself."
3,An entertaining read.,"I did enjoy this novel, but felt it was not nearly as good as advertised, and altogether unrealistic. I thought the writing style attempted to be more clever that it ever really was, and sensed this novel followed a pattern that so many others before it have established. MOMUS greatly intrigued me in the beginning, but soon became anti-climactic. It was, however, an easy read, and the frustrating finale actually garnered another star for not being a typical hollywood ending."
1,Not worth the effort,"I am not in the habit of complaining or whining, nor am I an habitual reviewer of other people's literary efforts, but really! This book would incite the most docile personality to action! I have never before read such a badly written book - and I have read many, believe me.Apart from the ending, which was rushed and left much unresolved, my main concerns arise out of the story's lack of veracity. Grossman's characters were just not believable. There were massive discrepencies between speech pattern and characterization....... I could go on, but why waste more time on this book reviewing it - I already wasted enough reading it!I wonder if anyone at the publishing house actually read this book before it went to press? If so, I can only guess that it must have been a half-brained teenager on work placement."
4,"Really quite good, but marketed wrong","I couldn't put this book down. I enjoyed the nominal plot, holes and all, but I kept reading for the tone. This is essentially a character-driven literary novel dressed up as a thriller, and I can see how that could be irritating for someone expecting Dan Brown. The ending doesn't follow genreconventions, but read within the context of a literary novel, it was well timed, properly hinted at, and generally sound.In many ways, it does feel like a first novel, but I found it most enjoyable and immediately passed it on to my partner, who also read it almost without stopping, and who also enjoyed it very much. (And I didn't stumble over many editing errors, and I'm pretty picky, so it's a surprise to see other reviewers complain about it.)I look forward to the author's next book."
2,Complete Mediocrity,"I picked up Codex after reading a few pages and a few reviews. I should have read the Amazon customer reviews. While not outright horrible, it was far from the exciting thrill-ride it was made out to be. Some of the reviews likened the book to Brown's The DaVinci Code.There are absolutely no thrills in the book.The characters are underdeveloped and the twists in the plot are painfully exiguous. The ending is abrupt and somewhat disappointing. I do like that there was no happily-ever-after; however, it seemed like there was a publishing time-crunch at the end. It seems to me that Mr Grossman had the demands of a due date and thusly ended the book prematurely.The plot, the characters, the setting, the ""thrills"", were, at best, mediocre.My recommendation is not to buy this book."
2,Disappointing ending,"I will have to agree with one of the previous reviewers who said that they were totally involved with the story, but then felt let down by the ending. I love books, and was fascinated by the search for the codex, but the ending felt false and very, very rushed. The various story lines were not neatly tied up at all."
2,Intersting idea that doesnt fully come to life,"I wanted to like the book having gotten a favorable review from a friend whose tastes I am sympathetic with and the fact that it was based in Manhattan and Brooklyn. It appeals too quickly to set pieces that are supposed to evoke the ambiance, then goes on to describe what has already been evoked, e.g., the 25 year old financial company whizkid, the nerd etc. But having said that it held my interest in terms of the intersection of old and new ideas and mysteries. I would have liked something more Borges-esque or Auster-esque, but in the end it was a quick airplane read, similar to Da Vinci Code but without the bigness of idea."
1,Blech!,"Let's just say I agree whole-heartedly with the other reviewers. It was a wonderful premise, lost its way and the ending was HORRID! I, too, had to go back and reread the last pages, thinking I missed something. The only thing I missed was my money and time!"
1,"From Dumb to Dumber, from Bad to Worse","This is a terrible book pretending to be ""complex,"" ""cerebral,"" and words dreamed up the critics. The critics compare it to the Name of the Rose, etc. The critics are wrong (or is it they want to praise one of their own). Everything about this book rings false: the Wall Street whiz, the computer game, the characterizations, the plot, ... I should have listened to my instincts, and quite after a chapter or two - instead I read the entire @#&(^ book."
1,Mezmerizing? Hardly...,"The critics always compare this type of 'literary detective novel' to The Name of the Rose, but 9 times out of 10 they fail to deliver the goods and this one is no exception.Unresearched, uninteresting, and with a spectacularly unfulfilling ending. Reading this book, it would seem that the author's last real experience with Medieval literature was reading the Canterbury Tales in highschool, and you get the feeling he'd have been better off stopping there rather than writing this monstrosity of a novel.Also a good of example why you should take cover blurbs with a (or perhaps several) grains of salt. Mine said ""Mezmerizing from start to finish... A fabulous double helix of a novel."" Setting aside for moment the inapt DNA metaphor, the only way this book could be considered mezmerizing is in the literal sense of 'causing incontinent fits of sleeping and or convulsions'.I really can't recommend this book to anyone other than those with a severe masochistic streak."
2,Wild ride that ends in a ditch,"SPOILERS AHEAD:What a great ride the first 3/4 of this book provided! Effortless segues between modern labyrinthine MYST-like games and medieval mysteries, with enough intriguing characters and a very human protagonist, and as the narrative galloped toward the end, accelerating in suspense and menace, I kept noticing that there were far too many loose ends to be tied up and too few pages to do so (sorry about the mixed metaphors). Authors should not tackle thrillers if they can't resolve them with satisfactory endings. I thought I'd missed something, went back and read the last few pages. Even thought my book may have lost some pages somehow. But reading some of the other reviews, I realize that I hadn't missed anything. There was nothing there to miss."
2,Huh? (Includes Spoilers),"I'm beginning to wonder if Codex is a put on of sorts. Yes it has some highpoints, some great descriptive passages. But nothing about the plot hangs together - why choose a 25 year old hot shot investment banker to catalog a collection of rare books? Why would a modern Duke find the possibility of an 700 hundred year old infidelity so explosive that it could be used as a weapon against him? Is there a connection between the codex and the duke's son's murder by kidnappers. No, after the murder/kinapping is mentiond once, it's dropped. Codex also contains some of the most errant nonsense. Our protagonist grew up in Bangor, Maine which he thought of as being semi-civilized but later realizes is more like the northern fastness of Ottawa!? Old Forge, New York is on the Hudson River (not exactly!). Other reviewers have commented on similar howlers about New York City. And then there's the non-ending."
2,"Good idea, mediocre delivery","As many of the other reviewers have indicated, this book had a really interesting plot. However, the characters were 2-dimensional and flat, and the ending was rushed. I was intrigued by the correlation between modern-day video game and medieval books. That is an interesting prospect! However, for much of the book, the detail on the video game is too much, and for the rest of the book, the detail on the characters is not enough. There were many characters, including Fabrikant, Zeph, Caroline and Nick that I didn't understand the point of including. The Duke/Dutchess issue could have been delved into much more, and the ending could have been given more body and oomph. I was disappointed when I put this book down. I wonder if this could be a case of too much editing? Or, perhaps we need a 2nd edition with some of the issues fixed. Bottom line, good potential, poor delivery."
2,Really went nowhere....slow.,"Even though the readers were supposed to believe that the main character cared about the codex and MOMUS...it was never really believable. The Duchess came off as some strange sort of automaton, and the story plodded along, and then was simply over with, with no satisfying outcome. Don't get me wrong...I don't need my stories to end with all of the loose ends tied-up neatly...but I does help when I care even a little bit about the outcome and the characters."
2,One or two more rewrites and he would have had something,"Well, this book is better than The Rule of Four but not as good as The DaVinci Code. As others have noted, the ending could have been better: my main feeling was ""I'm glad that's over."" I found it very hard to really feel much for the main character. As a character, he lacked depth and his development in the book didn't add much. I did enjoy the subplot with the computer game MOMUS, but that was the best fleshed out part of the the novel, which says something right there. One final note, Old Forge is in the middle of the Adirondacks, not right on the Hudson River. There was no poetic license necessary here, only a map."
2,"It Started Out Good, but . . . . .","This book is like a Sopapilla. It looks wonderful on the outside, but when you bite in, you realize that it is just hot air. Simply put, the ending of the book sucked. I can see why Mr. Grossman ended it the way that he did, but I felt completely unsatisifed at the end. Furthermore, the so-called secret of the book has been dealt with by the wonderful Arturo Perez-Reverte in his book the Club Dumas (which I recommend), and I figured it out pretty early on. While I felt that the book was good, I join my fellow reviewers in saying ""it could have been so much more."""
2,An interesting mistake,"I got this book because amazon had linked it with Neal Stephenson's The Confusion. The two books are nothing a like but subject matter of both was an interest to me and most reviewers seemed to liked it so I go it too. Overall, the book just never lived up to its potential. I would have liked to have given 2.5 stars because it certainly does grab you in the beginning, but you can't here. Nonethess I rounded down because the story never turns into anything interesting. I felt I was reading a high school student trying to write like Eco. The ending is laughable. However, I would suggest that an aspiring writer should read this and something like Arturo Pérez-Reverte's The Club Dumas; Club being an example of a well made literary mystery."
1,Terrible,"This book was truly awful. I read on the jacket that the author reviews books, which is hard to believe, because you would think he would know better. The mishmash of (meaningless) computer games and ancient books was bizarre, and not assisted by uninspired characters. Completely disappointing."
4,An interesting book,"I liked this book. In a way, it is similar to ""The DaVinci Code."" I liked how all the pieces slowly came together, but that the ending was a surprise. I did feel a little let down over the ending, but that's because I wanted to see what Edward would do next and also what happened to Margaret and the Duchess. But it was still an interesting book, and I will probably look for others by him."
1,Another empty promise,Wasted my money. Impractical and improbable story. Thinly - almost transparent character development. People predictable and situations - like the rescue in the jungle by an english speaking native who turns out to be another blood brother - so unbelievable to be laughable. Fit only for 7th or 8th grade readers(...).
1,very disappointing,Was really looking forward to reading this after all the reviews but found the book very disappointing. Not much of a plot and what was there was frequently nonsensical.
1,please don't buy...,"I really, really wanted to like this book, I really tried to like it. The plot is so unbelievable, and the mystery was pointless."
2,"But what about the ""ending""","To some extent, I would agree with all the other reviews. But...as an author, it's simply bad writing to build up the expectations of the reader, only to then offer up a flimsy ending and leave the reader feeling cheated. This book is not Eco, Gaddis, or Borges...if you write this kind of book, then finish the damn thing. Grossman obviously did not know how to end it, so just tacked on a few pages. Disappointing in the same way that ""Ex Libris"" by Ross King was...interesting read but lousy ending. Reviewers so far (New York Times, I'm looking chiefly at you) have given Grossman a pass on the ""ending"" (read their convuluted excuse this coming Sunday) likely because he writes book reviews for Time magazine. I should hope he'd have higher expectations for books he reviews than those he placed on himself with not bothering to actually finish the book."
5,The Da Vinci Code X 100,"I can't say enough about this book. It's funny and sad and scary, and every chapter ends with a bang, but you learn so much at the same time. If you love books, read it. If you love a good thriller, read it. First novel by a major, major talent."
1,Too much to swallow,"I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but . . .A bodega on Madison Avenue and Eighty-Fourth Street?An ugly, old high rise left over from the nineteenth century?An apartment building with a cheap-looking awning on Eighty-Fourth Street between Madison and Park?An archecturally inapproriate new top on a nineteenth century building in a landmark district?The there's the hero's job. I know more about what investment bankers do from reading about various financial scandles in the New York Times than the author bothered to find out before creating his hero's job description and resume.I gave up on page 25."
3,"Unpretentious entertainment, but the game thing could use a reality check","I liked Codex better than I have liked some of its more pretentious brothers-in-genre books (The Rule of Four, etc.). The writing is servicable with no claims to be deep or fancy. It kept me reading. I was pretty willing to buy most of the characters. In general, if you are buying this book for an airplane flight or to while away a few hours on the beach then you should be pretty satisfied.The game element in the book (MOMUS) was a major stumbling point for me. I play quite a few games and I recognized almost nothing of the experience of the main character in playing (except for the addictive part). I hate to nit pick at that kind of an issue, particularly since I do not think it will be a barrier for the majority of readers. However, it stuck in my throat as a reader and the irritation distracted heavily from the reading experience."
3,"Enjoyable for book lovers, with some big faults","As an avid book lover, I enjoyed the parts of this book that talked about organizing libraries, mysterious old book collections and the secrets that they contain, and the overall magic of working with books. I recommend this book if these things interest you. However, the overall story was a bit lacking. I was let down by the shallowness of the unlikable main character and the weak ending. There is also an allusion to a supernatural force at work (via a video game, of all things) on the main character, which never seems to make sense or go anywhere."
2,Bland on bland on not-bland-at-all,"In spite of the pedestrian prose, wooden characterization, and unimaginative narrative construction, I finished the book, drawn by the ingenuity of the two narratives within the narrative: the computer game and the medieval romance fragments which make up the ""quest"" element of this book are imaginatively conceived, even brilliant, and it's puzzling to understand how a writer original enough to develop such fine story lines could have wrapped them in such a perfunctory frame narrative."
2,"A quick, but disappointing read","I read the review of this one in the Times and thought it was worth a try. Unfortunately, the book did not hang together that well. The linkage between the two strands of the story (involving a medieval manuscript and a computer game) seemed forced. The main character was shallow, and consequently hard to like (and hard to root for). It was a quick read, but largely because there was no depth to the plot."
1,Did I get suckered in?,"There have been times when I've felt that the bulk of Amazon commentators have missed the mark. Not this time. Codex is a bad book. The only mystery here is how so many professional reviewers who really should have known better could have taken this one seriously. Perhaps many were authors who didn't want to offend a critic? If you do insist on wasting your time, at least don't waste your money: get this at the library or for less than a buck (a fair and worthy price) right here at Amazon."
1,Arghhhhh!,"Based on the build-up on the dust jacket, I really thought Codex would fulfill my love of artifact thrillers. Alas, that was not to be.It could have been a good read, had the author taken the time to develop his characters, had he answered all the questions he had created throughout the story. But unfortunately he didn't, not even at the end which was so pointless I read it three times thinking I'd missed something.This book was not worth the money I paid for it nor the time I spent reading it. Don't waste your money or your time. Instead try ""The Book of Air and Shadows"" and/or the ""Rule of Four,"" two fun books of this genre."
1,I only give it one star because that is the lowest it goes...,"This book was HORRIBLE. This is the first review I have written for this website and it's only because I feel so strongly that this book was ridiculously horrible. The whole time I was reading, I was thinking ""Oh, it looks like it is going to be good, something is unfolding, I can feel it..."" And then I realized, No, nothing happens. It never gets good. I thought I missed something in the end so I reread it three times. I am only thankful that I was not the only one to make this sad attempt to believe that the book has something more to offer. In one word - WEAK. Lev Grossman, I will never, EVER read one of your books again. I shudder in disgust."
1,ng,"This book was long and plotless, at no point in its uninteresting rambling did it in anyway approach literature or a narrative arc."
2,Is not on the same scale as DaVinci Code,I purchased this book because it was recommended to those who enjoyed DaVinci Code. Not as well written or interesting as DaVinci Code. Would not recommend it to others.
3,"Petrol, anyone?","This is a difficult book to rate. Entry into the book is odd, but it sweeps the reader away fairly quickly into the main plot of the story (as far as the reader knows), and the book carries the reader along fantastically, until the book all of a sudden accellerates to a breakneck speed, hurrying towards the ending, then running out of fuel and stalling in the last two pages.An excellent read, but a truly poor ending. Terrible ending. Big gaping hole, with the reader dangling through it, wondering where the floorboards went. Quite a shame, actually, considering how well the book was written.Oddly enough, there was very little real character development in this book. The strongest character developed was the Codex itself, but the story had enough life to carry the characters along, whether you knew them or not.I give a halting reccomendation to this book, perhaps avoid the last chapter, and imagine that it has a good ending. 3 stars is the max I can spend on it."
1,Don't waste your time,"I bought this book based on the several 5 star reviews it received on this site combined with my interest in antiquarian books. However, I was utterly disappointed. The writing is terrible, the story is dull and has little substance, and the ending is pathetic. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. A huge waste of time and money."
3,Please don't justify your shortcomings,"Ok. The book had its good points. The author managed to include enough interesting plot threads to keep my interest and to keep me in suspense about how the plot was going to be resolved. But the resolution was far less than satisfying. I gave the writer three stars as an average. The first 80% of the book would probably get four stars if the ending were not so disappointing.The author clearly realizes that he hasn't been able to pull it all together and write a satisfactory closing. It becomes obvious when a main character comments near the conclusion that in real life, as opposed to fiction, you don't always get to go home. (Or perhaps have a satisfactory ending?) I can understand not being able to tie up all the loose ends in a novel or to write a satisfactory closing, but please don't try to justify your shortcomings.Of course I'd be satisfied if the author just explained how the final switch of codex for money is supposed to have taken place."
2,Current edition is getting to be out of date.,The book is nicely written but it needs more frequent updating if it is to be of much use. Hawaii is changing more rapidly than perhaps the author would like to admit.Too many pages devoted to names and address of food markets etc. This information can better be found in phone books and such.
2,misleading title,"The book is actually about the big island and not Hawaii as a whole. Little mention anywhere on how to live comfortably on $1,000. The other book mentioned ""So You want to live is Hawaii"" is so much better. Amazing that this book is a new addition at all."
2,Poor Quality,"This book is not worth the price advertised. It has a few pages of color photos, the rest are poor quality black and white. The history of the airport was well done. Just wish that the photos could have been better."
5,Better mpg,We put one in our 2005 Prius and 2010 Mercury Mariner Hybrid and have notice an increase in our gas mileage of about 2+ mpg. We've recommended it to all of our friends.
4,"Classic Du Pre, Unnecessary Release","This CD confirms the great cellist Jacqueline Du Pre in a place of well deserved honor -- in the elite company of the world's best classical performers and conductors as featured in EMI's ""Great Recordings of the Century"" series. The problem is everyone already knew she was great and we have all had access to these recordings previously on CD. However, this mid-line title does make for a much better release than the still available full-price CD coupling one of the two Haydn Cello Concertos featured here with her recording of the Dvorak with then hubby Barenboim. However, the best way to get these magnificent works is in one of several larger EMI collections of Du Pre playing Cello Concertos -- my favorite being the 4-CD ""The Concerto Collection."" Du Pre's artistry is so incredible that it makes any and all purchases worth it."
4,is this the end?,acorn bites snowhite and snowhite bites acorn. who stared it? pam thinks she can help but anna and lulu are figting to! pam thinks anna is mad that lulu is in a show. she thinks acorn is beeter then snowhite and it's true! pam wants to help a lot. will it be the end of the pony pals?
4,excellent customer experience,"I got the SD 2100 and set it up. It showed a solid yellow light (not blinking-as the book says could happen). And I called the 1-800 number and expected to troubleshoot all day before expecting defeat. Instead after the second call I got a service person that gave me a order# and said I would get a new system in 2-7 days!! Excellent. No arguement and no waste of my time trying out a million different options. It seems the wall transmitter may not be functioning well. I don't mind getting a defective system, I just don't want to have to fight to get it replaced. Thank you Innotek!From,Happy New Beagle Owner."
4,"So far, so good","I have used this product with two dogs (1 year old lab, and 2 year old german shorthair/lab) for just over a month now. So far, it is going good. We had a little trouble training our dogs because the beep was to quiet on the collar and they appeared to not even hear it. So we did what we could and then let the dogs train themselves under supervision leaving the flags in extra long, and now they even stop when there favorite toy passes into the warning zone. We fenced in about 4 acres of yard and the dogs love their new fredom but respect the boundries!"
1,Randomly shocking dogs for no reason,"This fence came recommended by a friend. I'm positive we got a defective unit but my dogs and I were so traumatized by it that I opted for a refund, and to build a regular fence. The fence was installed in a perimeter around our house. We put out flags, and followed all instructions. At least one of the collars was definitely defective. My dog got shocked just going down the back steps of our house, nowhere near the boundary. Then it kept beeping while inside the house (not on the dog, just sitting on our table). I'm sure I could have exchanged it and tried again, but I was too nervous I'd get another defective unit or collar and the same thing would happen. Fortunately, Amazon has a great return policy and I was able to send it back via UPS today."
4,Pet fence,"I bought this unit to replace an old radio pet unit I had for several years that would no longer charge. All I needed was the transmitter and the collar since I had the wire already installed and the dog trained. I couldn't find any place that sold the transmitter and collar without the wire and flags. Installation was simply a matter of hooking up the wires to the new transmitter and charging the collar. Collar is lighter and smaller then the older one and seems to work just fine. No problems at this time. Don't need the battery backup, but had to use same system as my son's to contain his dog also. I would buy this item again when replacement is needed. Cheapest price found through Amazon. Four stars only because I had to purchase wire and flags when I didn't need them."
1,Innotek's Defective Product Return Policy is very poor,"The fence works fine except that the collar didn't stay charged very long. After owning the fence for 3 months, I called Innotek to exchange the collar and I had to pay $18 to have them send me a new one. I don't get credited when they recieve my defective collar! Absolutely ridiculous. I will never buy from them again because of this."
3,"good information, but not complete","This book would be excellent for someone who is looking to read a history of scandinavian knitting, but slightly less useful for someone who is looking to knit authentic tranditional scandinavian designs. While this book offers excellent information on scandinavian knitting, it often has just slightly less information than I would like to see. There are not enough pictures of knitted objects to get an idea of the range of items that were made in different places/times, and often there are not pictures of the original object to go with charted designs. Or, in some cases, the charted designs don't match the sample orignal object that is pictured. It has many colorwork charts, but they are scattered throughout the book, so it is sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. I was not as impressed with this book as I was with her book on Fair Isle knitting."
3,Good information,"There's some really good information in this book, but somehow I'm still a bit disappointed. Her book on Fair Isle just seems to have so much more information."
2,Not for Newbies,"If you are hoping to learn how to knit scandinavian mittens, this is not the book for you. I love the patterns, but, will have to pay someone to teach me how to knit from this book."
2,Not the best,"I don't like this tub. The sides are too low and even though I would NEVER leave my little one alone, I still feel like she is going to fall out of it. I like the no slip pad, but you can get that in almost tub. I also think the hook is a good idea. There are better tubs for resonable prices, get something else."
4,Indiglo is King.,"I have a Rolex, but I wear this Timex solely for the Indiglo. I actually used the glow to grovel my way down Old Rag Mountain in Virginia when the sun went down and it was so dark that I could not see my hand in front of my face. Not my choice of lighting, but beat sleeping in the snow. Very durable. I just replaced mine after over ten years of hard use (I never take my watch off for anything). Day-date window also keeps me oriented in the ""big picture"" as I am self employed and often forget what day it is...or maybe it's Alzheimers, not just unlimited free time..."
5,Husband loves this watch,It's simple. It's not all flashy. It's not riddled with unnecessary gadgets. It lights up and it's easy to read. What more do you need?
5,Does what it is meant to do,"I used to like this watch.I am not that old:) but when my father pinched my previous easy reader and would not swap it for a costlier watch, I bought it again- and kept wondering why would that happen(my father foresaking a costlier watch for this watch.)-His reasons were:-I can see the dial clearly during the day, and during the night-without straining the eyes looking for a little radium crystal somewhere.-The watch is not too heavy.-If I lose it I can buy it again(or pinch it) without much anguish.-It was free because he forced me to give to him as a gift (actually, I could not take it off him.)I am coming to those conclusions as well.It actually looks quite decent with brown leather strap.The Date adjustment can be very tricky- and finding the middle station very difficult.Significant loss of time has not been an issue so far- timex haven't mentioned the limits of accuracy in their brochure either.I will keep an eye on that."
2,Bad battery,"I received the watch, and although the minute/seconds hands worked, the date/day feature did not. Brought it to a mall kiosk, where the battery was replaced and the day/date feature now works properly. It appears the watch shipped with a bad battery.Otherwise, the watch looks sharp. It was too small/dainty for my hand (which I think is kind of average in size), but my wife likes it quite a bit if she's going for a little more masculine looking watch for the day."
2,timex men's watch with day and date- leather band,"it is a very professional looking watch. however, i am late to my appointments as the watch loses time and i have to reset at breakfast and at lunch. i don not recomend it. but, for $30 what do you expect."
5,Love the simple design with easy features,"First of all, I'm female and this watch works really well as a field watch casual look for me. I Love the simple design with easy features, like the date and indiglow. Lovely simple design is classic."
4,Love it,"I really like this watch for me...Easy to read dial...Although I can""t set the day...too hard to see the spot..I can at least see the time"
3,"Nice readable watchface, but uncomfortable band","My husband liked the readability of the watchface, but he found the wristband to be very uncomfortable, so we ended up returning the watch."
4,"Good Watch, Dial Not As Pictured","Good watch, I have a smaller wrist and it fits me fine, Indiglo is really nice feature and the date/time function stays current. I would say that the face of the watch is not a bright white as indicated in the pictures, but is more of a ""brushed silver."" Classic. Good quality."
2,Awesome but mine broke after one drop.,"This watch looks stylish. It would get you some compliments and feels great on your wrist. You can tell the leather is cheaply made, but what can you expect. It is worth $30.But what sucked was that I dropped it on cement once by accident and the snap metal back popped right out. I tried to put it back on with pliers and everything but it wouldn't snap back on. It was still working but the light button wasn't. It's a shame :(."
4,Timex watch,"Same watch that I have used for years ... it works fine, just like it should. I find Timex to be a good value."
5,I love this watch,"This is a great classic watch. I had gotten this as a gift. As a type and font junkie I love the the style of the numbers. The hands too are rectangular, not pointed, giving this a really snazzy style. It's easy to read and has that indiglo charm. Keeps time as well as any other and as someone who needs to know the date of the month every day of the week, this is a keeper."
4,Great for low vision people.,"This watch is great for older people with poor vision: indiglo light for nighttime, big numbers, day and date. It has almost everything but there's room for improvement. My parents are in their eighties with poor eyesight. Yet, like most people, they want to know what time it is, day or night. I looked everywhere for a watch with big numbers that mom could wear that lights up at night. I did locate a watch with a light and an easy to put on band in the health products catalogs, but the face was not big enough and had no day or date. There are OnTime watches that talk, for blind people who can hear. I have two suggestions for Timex: Make the Day and Date big enough to read AND put this on a ladies watchband. I spent another $13 for a ladies watchband. The band that comes with this watch is thick and big and heavy and made for men. I guess woman do not have the same vision problems as men...happens with so many products."
4,Great buy!,"Excellent watch for the money. Easy on the eyes, indiglo is excellent. Only complaints are the band is rather short and the watch is a bit thick. All in all, a great purchase!"
3,"Proof Of Adage ""Get What Pay For""","For the money, hard to complain. I have had it only a couple of weeks, and it STILL works! Shazam! Ridiculously difficult to set time and date. Must have been designed by the British, known for unduly complex engineering. Be sure to read the fine print in instructions regarding when it's OK to fiddle with time/date setting. Told do not attempt this between hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., as this is when the watch rolls over to display day following. WHAT?! Words ""Genuine Leather"" embossed on underside of strap, but only upper surface. Bottom looks and feels like cardboard -- stiff as a board. Instructions also state that an extended, four-year warranty is available for a mere $5.00. That's almost 20% price of watch. Probably pro-rated, too, so keep the fin for yourself."
4,Pleased so far.,"Bought this watch 3 months or so ago, and I'm quite pleased with it so far. It keeps time well, the Indiglo light makes the watch very easy to read even in very dark conditions and the time is obvious with the size of the numbers and hands. The only problem, and it is a minor one, is that the date can be difficult to read with just a glance, though one can read it quite easily by taking an extra moment while looking at the watch."
5,BEST WATCH EVER,"Sturdy and attractive leather strap. Functional face. Only three functions: day, date, and time, so it's not crowded. What else would you want on a watch anyway?"
2,Bulky Watch,"If you have a small wrist, this watch is too bulky, 35mm case size. Timex should make a case size around 30-33mm for men with small wrists. The leather band is too thick and my sleaves bunch up over it."
4,"Good, simple watch","Great watch for the price! Matches most everything I wear.The ticking of the watch is quite loud, but that doesn't bother me. One thing I dislike is that sometimes the leather appears to have a reddish hue."
4,love it,"wear it just about everyday, no issues. also bought the black version and it is similar quality. I hope they don't break or nothing because they look good, and they work good too!"
4,Nice watch for the money,"I was looking for an inexpensive white dial brown leather band watch. I found this watch on a website and liked the looks of it so I came to amazon and purchased it. I really like the watch but the one thing I will say to people is the leather band is quite thing, almost as thin as a woman's band. The Timex weekender bands are a little wider and look great. This easy readers band doesn't look bad but in my opinion it could be slightly wider. Nothing major but I guess for $30 you can't get it all!"
2,Easy Ready? No...,Time is very easy to read but the day/date is smaller and harder to see that it appears in the photo. I bought the watch for a senior with fair eyesite and he finds it too hard to read.
3,Decent watch,This is a good timepiece but I think the hands could be better. I would rather see black hands that start at the center and end pointed instead of square on this particular watch. Other than that I think this is a goody.
4,"Nice watch, a bit small.","Great watch overall. The only downside, with may not be an issue to some, is that the face of the watch is small for an average mans wrist."
4,Timex Easy Reader,Good utilitarian simple to read watch. Especially suited for older people who find small face printed numbers difficult to read. Calendar is helpful also.
5,still the best!,"There's nothing better than the classic timex! Easiest to read, beautiful classic design never trendy, 'keeps on ticking', easy to use night light, its simply the best. And the PRICE_ AMAZING!!!"
5,"Beautiful, Functional, and Simple Watch","I like this watch. It has everything I want: looks, simplicity, date & day of the week, a nice font face, and strap. The appearance is minimalist, but highly functional at the same time. The band is a sturdy leather strap, not too thick or thin in my opinion.With regards to the ticking noise, I don't think it's a problem so long as there is some ambient noise (if you're alone in the woods you may hear it). I am sensitive to noise myself and I am not bothered by the ticking.I couldn't be more pleased with the thing and highly recommend it!"
5,"Simple, luxurious, and sturdy quilt","This is my first quilt and I love it. The velvet side is close to the color of the picture while the inside is closer to baby blue. It's a very simple stitch, but it's pretty, the material is quality, and the weight is substantial, but not too heavy. I tend to be cold, so I use it during the summer, but it's more of a fall or winter quilt. A great product for the price. I would definitely buy another quilt from Amity."
5,Baby's favorite blankie,"This is a soft snuggly blankie and matches Cocalo's Tropical Punch nursery decor items. Our baby loves it - it's just big and thick enough to cover her warmly in a single layer but not too big or heavy for her to get entangled in or overheated. It gets washed every week, sometimes twice a week, and has not yet developed any naps or snags in the fabric or loose strings which is a plus."
4,Cute,"The colors were a little different than what I thought they would be around the edge, but it is still a very cute blanket. Nice and soft."
4,"If men were angels, we would not need government","Our leaders walk a fine line between making decisions on behalf of the collective action authority for the best of our nation versus simply for their selfish reasoning.Christopher Hitchens who is no stranger to pointing out the truly horrid things that man can do to man, he calls out names. In The Trial of Henry Kissinger, Hitchens makes the case for the all the war crimes committed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He stirs the pot and presents a plenitude of material.In later writings this case was to move forward on September 11, 2001, but as we know now, the world's attention moved in another direction and all these allegations fell to the way side.This book is an interesting read, but makes you think what is the balance between formal directed authority and self interest, what are the lines of accountability in a democracy that exist in a very dangerous shifting world."
4,Excellent Reporting and Criticism,"Hitchens' logic and reasoning are impeccable; his willingness to take on controversial topics renews my faith in the liberties we have in America, including freedom of speech and of the press."
5,Indictment & Conviction,"An excellent little polemic from the king of controversy. Hitchens has been called a traitor to the left, and not simply for his defense of the `war' in Afghanistan, but this should not discourage devoted leftists from reading his vitriol. Here he rakes Kissinger the way that he raked Clinton in `No One Left To Lie To' but with more hard evidence and less vicious innuendo. Indeed, there is no doubt that there is enough here to indict the infamous exponent of real politick and if half of what Hitchens suggests is true, enough to convict the little hatchet man as well. Needless to say, it's hard to believe it isn't true, would Kissinger hesitate to assassinate a man he considered a threat to the entrenched business interests he worshiped? It seems unlikely. OBEY"
2,Comprehesive but why is Henry Kissinger singled out? Is this,"a vendetta? There were many in the administration just as guilty, and this includes our elected Congress. Why Mr Hitchens, an excellent but very liberal biased (even in his new incarnation, he unreflectively labels leaders as war criminals) writer fixates on Henry K we'll never know. The peace prize was over the top though."
1,"Did Kissinger act in a vacuum? Why not Reagan, Mobutu?","Christopher Hitchens does have it in for Kissinger. In addition to the fact that whatever actions Kissinger may have promoted--whether or not they were legal--were authorized and actually set into motion by the U.S. Presidents he served (Johnson, Nixon, Ford), Hitchens is fixated on Kissinger as some sort of behind the scenes Rasputin. Also, there's a world of clearly and inarguably guilty war criminals out there Hitchens could be pursuing--in the former Yugoslavia, in Rwanda, in Syria, in Belgian Congo, in Turkey--and there are many within the current and prior U.S. Administrations he could be pursuing that have arguably contributed to mass murders at least to the extent Kissinger has if not more (i.e. Ronald Reagan with Iran Contra, for instance, U.S. support of the Taliban in the Iran-Iraq war, Reagan in Nicaragua), but nope, something about Kissinger alone makes him a juicy target for Hitchens."
2,selective facts,It would seem hitchens has a specific vendetta against kissinger as if the others in the administration weren't cultivating foreign policy. This is a smear.
5,great history of U.S. foreign policy.,"Trial of Henry Kissenger provides a short but interesting history of Henry Kissenger, who was extremely influcial in U.S. foreign policy under the Nixon administration. It provides a well planned out research on Kissenger's record on U.S. foreign policy. I was aware of Kissenger's role in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia a but was less aware of his record in places like Bangladesh, Cyprus, Indonesia and Chile. Hitchens does a good job of bringing U.S. foreign policy into question and asks the question what if another country was copying U.S. foreign policy. Would there be global outrage and war crimes trial? The tenth chapter 'afterwood the profit margin' is really great because it provides insight into possibile Kissenger motives."
1,Buy a Laymon novel instead,"150 pages into this I realized I had started skimming and looking at page numbers. Along the way, I snuck a peek at the author's bio on the last page and was surprised to find that this wasn't his first novel. The writing is elementary (""see Jane run""), the plot is one we've seen a million times on cable at 2am, and I knew the editor was asleep at the wheel when I read the word ""trifle"" three times in three pages. If you're looking for good horror fiction, save yourself the time and money on this one and invest in a Richard Laymon book instead."
2,It's no Innsmouth,"I had hoped for a novel length ""Shadow Over Innsmouth"", but this isn't it. The writing is below the worst of the pulps, it totally lacks the atmosphere Lovecraft excelled at, and the characters were closer to tissue paper than cardboard. The idea itself, though not overly original, was pretty good, it's just that the author failed to develop it at all. There are also a few ""politically correst"" speeches by the main character that have absolutely nothing to do with anything in the book."
2,CERTAINLY NOT MY USUAL CUP OF TEA!!!,"Nope, nada, no way, , , ,not for me!!!There are probably quite a few people who wouldenjoy this kind of book, , ,not me, thanks anyway.I picked it up because it looked interesting!!! I didfinish it though, that's something!!!"
5,the perfect iron,"I searched in Consumers report for the best steam iron, and this B&D digital steam iron has the best reviews. I was skeptic, because I allways used Rowenta which is an excellent iron; but I took the chance with this black an decker which is cheaper. Perfect ironing, bigger water tank, self cleaning, digital, a little bit heavier for better pressing. I am glad to change from Rowenta to Black and Decker (this specific model D2030)"
2,Not a good choice,"I was expecting this to be sturdier, and assembled due to the postage amount. The weld on the bottom rack was broken when I took it out of the box. Not sure this will last long, and not sure it will hold much weight."
4,"A bit smaller than hoped for, but solid and well finished","We wanted this rack for our bath towels, so they can be aired while not in use. You have to fold the bath towels to fit them on - a hand towel towel fits no problem.It is pretty solid once you put together, and we like the way it fits almost anywhere around the room whitout looking out of place.Pretty happy with it :)."
4,Head on,"Rubino's formula for constructing a head is a pretty sure-fire way of arriving at a structually correct representation of a subject. However, I miss the sensitivity to character and personality necessary for a true ""portrait"" . The fact that he does not include the full neck and shoulders so one knows how the model holds his head is important even if this part of the body is removed in the final presentation.A student using this book should consult Luchesi and Grubbs also."
3,"Reasonably helpful, for beginners only","First of all, the author's portfolio is less than inspiring, to put it rather mildly. The text is actually fairly well written, and will be of some help to the beginner, although there are certainly better guides out there. To the author's credit, I've given the same rating to books with better techniques by better artists; the decent writing helps here. However there isn't much here for intermediate or advanced artists. Many of the techniques run the gamut from sloppy to downright lazy, and the results show this. If you'd like to make your way to a moderately successful stint as a mediocre contemporary sculptor without working too hard to get there, this book is for you. Of course, lots and lots of folks fit in this category. However, if you wish to push yourself to higher levels to become a disciplined, highly skilled artist, I would seriously recommend Edouard Lanteri's books instead."
5,Masterful story set in helpful context,"The Race delivers on the promise of an intensely educational and suspenseful read. I learned much more than I expected to about multihull design, sailing history, and the characters involved in circumnavigation adventures, but I was also viscerally ""there"" during the more stressful parts of the Race itself. Zimmerman provides exceptional context as well as insight into what makes these men and their sailing machines run. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone curious about the quest for speed across the waves."
4,You can't miss this if you are a racing sailor,"It is the story of a great race told by a sailor. Any person who knows about ocean racing cannot but enjoy this book. My only observation is about the edition, I would love to have some more pictures (better if in color)"
5,"Cimson Trace, good product, years of service","I am surprised that Vince has a problem with his Crimson Trace. There are Laser products out there that look exactly like Crimson Trace products but not matching the quality. I know. I own one. Crimson trace, on the other hand, I own about 8 or 9 over the years. I have them on 6 of my 1911, and two rifles. Works as advertised. Some units are going on the 8 years of service and still sitting on the original batteries. Vince, you should contact Crimson trace regardless if the warranted is already up. They will work with you. I know. I contacted them regarding an obsolete model I purchased for a 1911. LG201. No longer made but they will work with you regarding their products."
1,NOT for Dremel 770!,"This battery absolutely, positively will not fit the Dremel 770! This picture IS WRONG! They will send you a 757-01 battery. Look for the 757 battery elsewhere."
1,Dremel 7.2v F/multipro Tl Kit Battery Pack,"The battery pictured is not the one you will receive. This battery is no longer available according to the manufacturer. After oredering two of the batteries {from different suppliers} both items I received were wrong. When I contacted the suppliers, they advised that they are not responsible for the picture on the Amazon website. Unfortunately there is no way to know this until you get the wrong item. I never did find the one I was looking for."
4,love this phone!,I have a purple room and this phone was the final touch. It is mainly for show so i dont use it much (cell). The only problem I have is the handle is very heavy and big. Good quality! heavy and solid!
4,LBJ's tapes do us a favor for history,"President Lyndon Johnson's tapes are exactly why modern presidents might want to leave the recorders off. We can read all kinds of conversations here- from his domestic problems with civil rights, to his election, to the war in Vietnam. We also can see how tender he was towards his wife, while still having affairs with other women. Michael Beschloss does us all a favor by providing transcripts of the tapes' key moments in the first two years of LBJ's presidency, with background material to explain all of their significance. Vietnam War researchers and U.S. history buffs will need to make this book a guaranteed spot on their shelves. Please note, too, that the auditapes are also available- but not all of the material in the book is found on the tapes."
4,Very Warm,"The boots are tough tested. I live in upstate Ny so having a pair of boots that keep your feet dry and warm is very important, these boots provided just that. My only bad is the white is very hard to keep clean, I would suggest the blk."
5,Excellent CD,I just got this CD today and totally love it. I have both of her other CD's and love them too. This is just another great album by Lila McCann.
2,Okay,"This Cd is about a two star album. If I had to grade it I would say it's about a D+ this is a far cry from an A. The vocals are weak and sound like a little girl with an undeveloped voice singing. In addition, it doesn't really seem like she knows what she is singing about. The songs go deep into adult content and I doubt she knows what this stuff actually means. She has no passion in these songs like many sings have...Dolly Parton isn't a great singer but she's passionate about the music (and actually knows what the song is about). Lila needs to grow up, take some voice lessons, and then make an album. At least I didn't give this a 1 star...that 1 star goes to Ashlee Simpson."
3,still like the first album,"I still feel that her songs on Lila were better. some of the songs here seem mediocre. Some songs even sound alike. the best on here are complete and she remembers love.Lila has a great voice , no doubt about that, I think I would chuck it if it wasn't for Lila's voice. I still will listen, but I might not wear it out like the album Lila."
1,marshall of cedar rock,"the movie is fine, but the producing company has put out a product that stinks.....the picture looks like it was filmed in a theater.....the sound fades in or out and at times is garbled.. I have bought other movies from this company and the results are always the same.....awful...can't this company spend some money to clean up their products? Guess I'm slow but no more movies from this company for me."
2,Absolutely Not,"Do not buy this kodak camera!! it's body is a thin plasitc painted silver. It will withstand about 4 or 5 drops. i dropped it more and no matter what batteries I put in, it will last about 2 seconds. i am never buying a kodak again."
4,Buena camara Digital,"Estube investigando y consultando los datasheet de muchas camarasdigitales y la unica que me llamo la atencion por su precio fue esta, es una camara buena es muy facil de manejar y se ajusta a lo que un principiante busca.Lo unico malo son dos cosas:*Primero que todo aconsejo que compren baterrias racargables por que esta camara consume las baterrias standar muy rapido mas o menos unas 50 fotos.*La calidad de las fotos crei que iba ser mejor la calidad es buena pero no excelente!!!!!!!!!! aconsejo que inviertan mejor ne la serie 6330 es excelente.Aprovechen ademas y compren una memoria sd de 128 MB para no tener futuros problemas con la memoria interna de la camara que son 16 MB."
5,A Digital for dummies (and that's a GOOD thing),"My first digital was a 1.0 Olympus for $399.00 The LCD quit working after 2 years, and it was going to cost $100.00 to repair. I thought naught! A new eMac running Panther with a new Epson printer prodded me to purchase a new camera. Amazon had it for $129.00 with a ""free"" 32 MB Viking memory card. I upgraded to a 128 MB card for lots of pictures. I needed to upgrade the camera software from the Kodak website, but it works flawlessly with panther! This camera is great! It is very intuitive, and I didn't even look at the book for the first few pictures; it was point and shoot. Downloading the pictures via the USB port was a snap (also very quick!) On the eMac, the pictures are automatically downloaded into a picture folder which works with iphoto. The picture quality color is excellent when printed out. I find this a great camera for the novice or intermediate picture taker. It is definitely a digital for dummies!"
1,EATS BATTERIES!,"I have owned a Kodak EasyShare CX6230 for a couple years and it eats batteries for dinner.If you don't mind feeding your Kodak Camera batteries all the time, then go ahead and get one. My Kodak hardly ever had enough power to take some pictures and then download them off the camera without putting in new batteries.I have upgraded to Canon PowerShot SD600 which is powered by a lithium-ion battery (battery and charger included)which is a HUGE plus."
1,Absolutely horrible waste of money,"Like the guy below, my camera just stopped working one day, and its now past warranty. The liveview just shows a white or blue screen and it won't take pictures. I never used it very often, never dropped it, and never got it wet. Yet, despite all that, it still doesn't work. When it did still work, I have to admit that the quality of the pictures was wanting... I was dissatisfied with most of the pictures I took with it. It made photogenic people look shiny and unattractive. I would not recommend a kodak digital camera to anyone else, nor will I be buying another one, ever."
2,Stay away from this camera,"We bought a similar Kodak camera (CX7220) 18 months ago. It takes OK pictures and is easy to use, but the body is a thin plastic. The battery hatch door on the bottom is very vulnerable to breakage. Drop the camera once and you will easily crack the door. You might think a big company like Kodak would make it easy to call in and get a new hatch door mailed to you. The part is worth maybe 2 cents. I tried and was told no, you have to send it in for repair - for which there is a $50 flat fee!Also - don't bother installing the Easy Share software on your PC. The Windows Picture It software is free and much simpler and faster."
3,Good First camera,"This camera is a very well built. I've had it over 3 years now ( When i go it, i paid about $200 for it, so it's dropped quite a bit in 3 years). If your worried about the fact it had only 2MP, don't. 2MP is perfect for 4x7(typical size of 35mm pics), and it will show a full picture on the computer screen(which looks very nice). Well if u got the money i'd def go with the Z700 by kodak, but this is still a very effective, and at that price, how can you beat it?"
1,I think it's a lemon,"I bought my Kodak CX6230 digital camera a little over a year ago and have had nothing but trouble with it. It has been sent back twice to be ""fixed"" and is still very inconsistent in its ability to take a picture. As I write this, Kodak is ignoring me and not responding to any of my requests for a refund or to trade the camera in for another. When I originally bought the camera I did hours of research and was pleased with all of the reviews for this camera. I knew it was in the low price range but there were no glaring reasons not to buy it. My biggest complaint is with Kodak customer service who will not take responsibility for my camera which is most likely just a fluke in their production."
1,"DVD does not play in the US, terrible customer service","DVD is Regionally Restricted and will not play on USA players. NO response from CD Importers, a TERRIBLE online buying experience."
4,Good Laughs,I am a huge fan of Summer Heights High and We Can Be Heroes didn't quite match up. It was still entertaining and Chris Lilley is insanely talented but I didn't enjoy it as much.
3,We Can Be Heroes,DVD can only be played on my Apple computer. This Aussie DVD won't play in a USA DVD player.When viewed -- very funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,brilliant!,"funny, witty, clever, and at times heart felt. I adored the show. Also see Summer Heights High! Loved it!"
2,"Useful, but incomplete","Kimber's book is well written and readable. There are numerous diagrams showing the lighting set-up used. Why am I less than enthusiastic? First, Kimber repeatedly stresses that tungsten lights will produce a warm, glamorous image. In my opinion, so repeatedly that he excludes other, equally useful information. I also think that the quality of the photographs is not sufficiently good to accurately show some of the lighting effects. If you have access to a full studio and can test his set-ups, fine. If you don't... This is NOT the only book I'd want to own about glamour photography, although in fairness it does contain numerous good examples of effective lighting. Borrow from your library."
2,Disappointingly small amounts of info,"If you're going to teach something about lighting, it would seem that there'd be a lot of diagrams and a range of examples. And if you're about glamour, you'd think the photographic quality and print quality would be first rate. The book is only OK; there's maybe an hour's worth of info in it. There are much better books (like Steve Bavister's Glamour and Portrait books) that are full of explanations, diagrams, and ways to think about approaching your subject."
4,a good one...,"pretty good book. many of the techniques are really detailed, which i like. after all, this book is a tutorial. the author has obvious partialities, but you know...? they work.good job!"
4,1971 jungle lounge,"Nino Nardini's Jungle Obsession is an album of production music recorded in 1971 and released for public consumption almost 30 years later. As the title suggests, all tracks have an exotic bent -- think Martin Denny; however, the '70s production adds a more solid bass-and-drums bottom end. Some tracks are more mellow and feature loads of strings while others have primitive electronics, vibes, wah guitar and organ. Great tracks are ""Shere Khan"" a lush, string-laden track with an underlying sense of danger, and ""Jungle Mystery"" which has a, well... um, a MYSTERIOUS vibe to it."
5,Great film,"One of the top 5 satires of the last 30 years. Brilliant dialogue from start to finish. I'd consider it the best film Robert Altman never directed, which is the highest praise I can think of."
4,"Great, underrated movie, denounced by ""elite"" film critics","""Art fart!"" One of the greatest lines ever written. This is a great movie for us bourgeois unwashed masses. A must see."
4,Comfort is King,"I just bought this watch and I'm very happy with it. I got it primarily for large display and comfort. I wanted a G-shock but found it too bulky/uncomfortable and the display too small. I'm very picky about the feel and look of a watch, if it's not just right it will end up sitting on my dresser. Eventhough I'm loyal Amazon customer, I ended up buying at Walmart for $33.Pros:-Light and thin.-Large easy to read display.-Soft comfortable adjustable velcro band.-Lots of timers for athletesCons:-Lacks hi-tec features found in casio (solar power and radio time sync).-Buttons are easily depressed (its nice when setting but can be hit by accident).-Band and plastic loops don't feel that durable."
5,What a Wonderful Novel!,"I really enjoyed this book! A sort of male-perspective on the common chick lit themes of love, relationships and family, Tropper created three dimensional, sympathetic characters. Zack, the main character, is only outshined by the skill in which Tropper created Peter. And the situations he put them in - hilarious! I laughed out loud more than a few times! I was also surprisingly moved at times. He is a talented writer and I am looking forward to reading some of his other books - in fact, I have two others waiting for me at home!"
4,"Worth reading, with a caveat","(I'd give this 3 and a half stars, if that were an option.) Jonathan Tropper faces the difficult challenge of following in the footsteps of his funny and poignant ""Book of Joe."" Tropper's natural sense of humor is present in ""Everything Changes"" and there are some truly hilarious scenes involving Zach's father. A couple places where the novel falls short: The character of Hope is poorly developed, little more than an outline of a person. It's possible this is meant to parallel Zach's feelings about her, but that seems like a lazy way out for a writer as talented as Tropper (he does a fantastic job of creating Tamara). The ending also feels thrown on, a last minute attempt to create a satisfying resolution. Not rushing the publication of Everything Changes (maybe to coincide with the paperback run of Book of Joe?) might have allowed Tropper to work out some of these issues. But even still, Tropper is a writer worth reading, often engaging and always funny."
4,Dysfunctional,I love the honesty and self deprecation that johnathnTropper gives to his main characters. He definitely doesn't have his main subject looking through rosé colored glasses . His writing can be very humerous and heartbreaking at the same time. His writings are probably more true to life than fiction. I am looking forward to his next book.
4,Touching story,"After seeing so many positive reviews, I thought I should give it a try. I am glad I did. This novel captivated my interest from the beginning. I didn't want to put it down. The best part is that there is not one moment/scene in this book that is unnecessary or irrelevant to the story. At the beginning of the story, Zachary King has a good job, a beautiful fiance, living with his best friend rent-free and is confused with his growing feelings for his other best friend's widow, Tamara. When he discovers potential cancer and his father returns after fifteen years looking to make amends, he starts thinking about various aspects of his life and making some serious decisions which lead to a lot of changes in his life. Very intelligently written, funny, touching story. This is my first novel from this author and I am definitely looking forward to read his other books."
3,Kept me interested ..,"interesting characters, especially dad, Norm. You could feel Zack's pain and grief. I'd recommend this one to friends and read more byTropper."
4,Great Read,"I didn't like this novel as much as Tropper's ""This is Where I Leave You"", but it was still a great read.It was very interesting to see the main character go through so many changes in his life all at once. It was, in a strange way, inspiring!One aspect I liked about the book - the main character was gutsy... he did things we all wish we could do. There are certainly aspects I could definitely relate to!"
5,Immersion,"This was a complete immersion experience from the first sentence. Immersion into the psyche, the relationships, the family and finally back again. Not a false note in the whole book. I was so sorry to see it end, yet it ended beautifully. Exceptional."
1,Photocopy,"The quality of this book is horrible. I would have been better off borrowing the book and making a copy than buying. If I had photocopied the entire book, the only difference between what is being sold here and my photocopy would have been the binding. There are parts of this book that are now worthless because the original was probably in color and when copied to black and white, well you can't exactly read black text in a dark almost black box. The worst part, I'd fail the class if I returned the book and can't afford to buy another copy..."
1,did not fit my 2010,the back seats area // it did not fit // will have to cup up or //will have to return if I can find the info / no paper work came with box / shipment split
5,Love it!,This is a very neat clock. I love the shells. It is very heavy though so make sure it is well anchored.
2,Not really a manual,"This book looks like a compilation of lecture notes. It is not a comprehensive list of what Stata can do. Rather, it is short, contains a small amount of useful information (certainly compared to its price), and only illustrates how to accomplish a limited number of tasks. Most of these you can figure out from the online help. There is almost no information about how to input data.A book to avoid."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought this book as a complete STATA novice and have been quite disappointed with it. First, there is very little information on data input which was one of the first things I needed to do in order to be able to use the program (another reviewer also noted this). I spent much more time on various STATA websites getting answers to my questions than I did consulting the book, simply because the book didn't have what I needed as a beginner. Others I have loaned it to have said similar things, and ultimately end up using a different book or the websites as I did. That said, it does seem to have quite a bit of useful information if you have some background STATA knowledge and experience, so it's not a total dud. My best advice is to avoid this if you are completely new to STATA."
1,Lecture notes at best,"This book is terrible, it doesn't really tell you anything that you couldn't find out from the help or 5 minutes of Googling. It rarely goes into detail, and when it does it's not on Stata itself or what you're actually doing but the mathematical functions behind something tangentially related. It's written as if by a schizophrenic and one point they're telling you to do a multivariate regression, though never why, and then they're onto scatterplots without ever finishing the multivariate regression. Seriously, check chapter 3 if you do buy this, you'll see. Just a terrible, terrible book. Do not buy it."
2,"""Surprising Twist at the End"" ????","The production values of this movie are terrible. Bad sound, crummy picture (I was nearly knocked off of my seat when I turned off this movie and switched to regular TV - I had to turn up the sound so much) and shoestring budget.The story is all over the place, its like a cheap version of an episode of Millenium, Lance Henrickson's great TV show. The ponderous dialog did'nt help either.As for the ""Surprise"" ending... It was no surprise to anyone. Watch ""Seven"" again, rather than watch this movie once."
3,Good,Though I love some of the Mousse T songs the CD is not that great and I would recommend to buy individual songs instead.
2,Should never have been published!,"This book is inappropriate for anyone under thirteen or fourteen or so. I read the book about a year ago and am still reassuring myself that it isn't real. My friend read it and had nightmares for several months afterward! Why read this sort of freaky junk when there is lots of real literature out there-the Underland series by Suzanne Collins or the Charlie Bone books, for instance?"
4,Acoustic Masterpiece,"Although the new line-up struggles to live up to the original line-up (regardless of member changes), this album is by far one of the greatest sounds to come from Lynyrd Skynyrd. Getting away from the Arena Rock style of Southern Rock they play so well, this album removes the loud and inserts the calm. The all acoustic album recreates some of the better songs released by the original Lynyrd Skynyrd and brings forth a few new ones as well. Songs like ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""Saturday Night Special"" sound better arena style, but ""Things Goin' On"" and ""Am I Losin'"" sound so much sweeter acoustic. A definite must for true Lynyrd Skynyrd fans, and a recommended album for those interested in what the new line-up has to offer."
3,Gimme Three Stars,"Good Singing. Good playing. The only great Skynyrd disc from the ""reunion"" band.The newer songs almost stand up to the classics.Johnny Van Zandt's vocals are especially good.Any fan from any era should love it."
5,Buck Brannaman is fantastic!,"Such a heart felt book. I was drawn in and couldn't put this book down. After reading this book, you will look at things in a different way."
5,Well Done,"Each of the stories told have a ""gem"" that I will keep..... Hope to pass them on when the ""time is right"""
2,Dissappointing.......,"Not at all what I expected. I found it sappy and not informative. I'm a horse lover and am always looking for ways to connect with my horse, but this was about people's life experiences more than their horse experiences, I found it way over the top in the sappy department. I expected more from B. Brannaman."
4,Excellent book,"Got this for my dad for Christmas, but from what I have read of it myself, it seems to be a great book. Full of lots of wisdom.Doc"
4,horses heal people,"Buck has co-written a wonderful dedication to the healing power in the connection between horses and people. Having attended quite a few of his clinics and visited with him several times, I have seen how dedicated he is to the horse and to helping those people who are truly looking for a better way, not only in their horsemanship, but in their lives as well.Well worth the read.I gave it four stars instead of 5, because Far away horses was better....sorry Buck."
3,Promotional Mush.,"I really enjoyed reading Buck's first book, Far Away Horses, so I was looking forward to reading this book. I was surprised to find that this book is just a lot of testimonials from Buck's former students gushing about how he has changed their lives. I was quite suprised that he would put out a book like this. I think he is a great horseman that doesn't need to push his worth by publishing a book filled with praises for himself. Essentially all this book does is pat him on the back. Maybe he wanted to point out how learning to connect with your horse can change a person's attitude, but I came away feeling a bit turned off because of so much gushing."
3,continues where Faraway horses ends...,Enjoyed Faraway horses and this is a sequel to it. It is individual stories of people helped. So far its pretty interesting and I am still reading it.
3,believe;a horseman's journey,it was interesting for the most part.not what t was looking for.i was wanting more detail training.but enjoyed the different stories about other peoples horses!
4,overall good product,The dresser was easy to put together. Took my husband a couple of hours to do it. The only complaint I have is that some of the side wood pieces for the drawers were split and he had to glue them back together. The finish is beautiful and matches perfect with my daughters cherry wood crib she already has.
4,Good value,"Overall, a good value, and well packaged, but difficult to assemble and instructions weren't that good. A little on the cheap side for construction, but, again, good value for the price. Nice finish!"
5,Good product,"Arrived on time, easy to put together. Good quality hardware. Nice design. We are happy with it and would recommend it"
1,"Very cheap-scratched,parts missing",This dresser was scratched on the sides. a rail came without a wheel and it is one of the cheapest things I've seen!Ordered this for my sister so it would be here for when she came home with her newborn. I'm so embarassed by this product. We can't send it back now- very unhappy with this product. I hope the company will at the very least send me a rail to replace the broken one.
4,Good for the price,"Very pretty cherry color, good quality for the price. Shipped very quickly & was packaged well, pretty easy to put together as well."
2,Poor Quality - Cheap,"This dresser is really cheap and poorly made. It has wood veneer, but is made of particle board. The drawers are really cheap and will break soon. On a positive note, this dresser looks pretty good, and is inexpensive. You get what you pay for. If you are looking for decent quality or good quality, do not buy this dresser. If you want cheap that looks decent, this is an ok dresser."
4,I bought 2,"I bought 2 of these dressers. One in Black and the other White. They came very well packaged and damage free. one box was torn but the dressers parts were fine. If your not paitent with assembly then stay away. It's not hard, but is time consuming. I used glue while putting these dressers together because I do not like the hardware system they use, (easy to work loose over time). Very nice clean looks. Top drawers were a little crooked but still close fine without trying to adjust the drawers. Made from pressboard so be careful with screws in the edges of the drawers, and also they are very heavy to move."
1,Nice wood but very poor assembly tools,"This is a very nice furniture piece BUT the tools this dresser comes with are very poor quality!! It comes with these locking screw things that kept breaking and it doesn't make the dresser very sturdy; it wobbles and that is a concern if it will be used by a young child. It took my husband,who is VERY mechanically inclined, 4 hours to put this thing together and we get to the last drawer and they sent us 2 of the same side slides for the drawer. So, now I have to call the manufacturer to have them send us the correct pieces. My advice to other prospective buyers of this type of furniture is go ahead and spend the extra money on something in a furniture store!! This was not worth the added stress!!"
5,Great Dresser,"This is a great dresser! It matches perfectly with all of my daughter's furniture. Also, it wasn't that difficult to put the dresser together - it took my husband and I about 1hr ? to put the dresser together. I also suggest buying the dresser at Wal-Mart it cost less there and UPS shipped it so we had no difficulties in the delivery process."
2,Pretty good dresser,I received the dresser after many delays. The condition of the dresser is good it just took awhile to receive. The dresser is good and heavy and worth the money.
3,Nice Solid Chest of Drawers,"My wife and I got this for our son's nursery. It is a nice heavy piece that seems pretty solid. My biggest complaint and about only complaint is the instructions are terrible. It's easy to assemble once you decipher the instructions, but they are just very vague and not nearly descriptive enough. It does help a little to look at some of the steps ahead in the booklet to get an idea of how things go."
5,chest of drawers,"Perfect for a good price. A lot of putting the whole thing , but the instructions were very good, and all the pieces and screw were there."
1,Color should be called chocolate,"Immediately upon opening it and seeing the color, I sent it right back. The color is dark chocolate and made from poor material."
2,"good product, hard to assemble","This is a great product, but very hard to assemble. It took 3 hours to put it together, and I have a PhD degree. My hands are still hurting from using the screw driver. Too many screws. They should have built considering ease of assembly. They should go check Ikea and see how their furniture is easy to put it together."
4,Not sure I would buy again..,We bought this chest of drawers to match our sons crib. We've owned it for 6 years now and probably would not buy again. It came with scratches in the finish (crib did as well..). One of the drawers is constantly falling apart no matter how many times we fix it. The front piece on one side comes lose if you open it by that side's knob which makes the bottom part of the drawer slip out too.
2,Falling apart after less than 2 years,"This dresser is a pain in the rear to put together, no doubt. I did it alone at 7 months pregnant....it just took me a couple days. It is very pretty and goes well in my baby's nursery. It doesn't seem flimsy and although it's not an heirloom piece of furniture, I believe it will hold up for at least a few years. At this price, I can't complain!Update February 2013:Well, I changed my review of this from 4 to 2 stars. My son is 19 months old and the dresser is falling apart. The drawers won't stay together for more than a day before the hardware starts popping out again. I'm really disappointed."
4,Looking good!,"This piece took a while to put together and the holes don't always line up so you need to make your own (easily) in a few cases. But, my husband was able to do it in approx 2 hours and it really is working well for us. We are using it for a changing table as well and the height is perfect for us- much better and sturdier than our last changing table. We have a 9 month old, however, and if you are using this as a changing table it is higher than the standard ones and you must be very careful for those of us with squirmy rolling babies. Another note: we priced out many sites and this was the best deal by far."
3,Okay for the price,I bought this dresser for our daughter that we are expecting soon. It is a nice dresser. The only complaint would be immediately one of the bottom pieces fell off making it slightly uneven. Otherwise we like it espically for the price.
2,A little frustrated,"My husband and I put this dresser together last night for our sons nursery. We were frustrated by how far the drawer-pulls allow you to pull out the drawers. The diagram shows that they are the length of the drawer, but when you actually attach them, they are too short and only allow the drawer to open up halfway. We even removed them and tried different ways a few times, thinking it was our error, but it's not. I read that someone else just went and bought new drawer-pulls, but you really shouldn't have to do that when you buy a piece of furniture. The dresser looks nice enough, but the quality of the materials is not as good as I expected from the description."
3,You get what you pay for,"I planned to use this as a changing table but wanted enough space to store things. I went with the 4-drawer so I have enough space and it seems it will be a perfect size. The instructions were easy to follow and went together fairly quickly. Some of the screws stripped easily and the wood split in certain places but that could have been operator error. The dresser seems fragile so don't let the kids hang on them or crawl in them. The drawers don't slide open as easy as our daughter's DaVinci dresser either.I was also a bit disappointed when I opened the package and there were blemishes/imperfections on the fronts of drawers and certain pieces were already chipped.This is definitely a good dresser for the price but if you can, I would spend a bit more on a quality piece of furniture. All in all, you get what you pay for. Hope this helps because I know there are a lot of different reviews on this product."
2,Easily falls apart,"I understand this was not an expensive item but it took two of us over two hours to put together. There were several blemishs in the finish. When putting the sliding rails on the drawers, everyone of the sides of the drawers slipt, which meant we had to glue the rails on instead of screwing them in. I was very disappointed in the quailty."
1,"Junk, don't buy","I purchased this item because it had pretty good reviews and is available on Amazon prime. After eighteen months of ownership I regret my purchase. The bottom of each drawer is made of low quality panelling that droops over time. The fronts for two of my drawers have warped and bowed out, which leads the bottoms of the drawers to sag. This is really just a junk product.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this junk."
4,Great Value,"Great quality at an excellent price. I purchased this to complement existing crib and other furniture in the toddlers room, as running out of clothes space when her sister was born. Good mid-level quality if you don't want to spring for the super expensive stuff....Not difficult to assemble, takes a couple hours."
2,Crap Crap Crap,"I bought this 2 years ago and after the 1st year I spent several hours glueing this thing together to make it last. Yesterday it fell completely apart. The rails fell off the bottom two drawers. It's made of crap and the hardware is even worse. If you buy this, get some really good glue to go with it..."
1,Watch paint dry before you watch this video.,"I ordered this video because I'm a big science fiction fan, but this video (I won't call it a film, because it was obviously shot very quickly on video) seemed like they made it up as they went along. I'm still not sure what it was about. There's this guy (David Heavener, who also directed) that's dressed up in some weird outfit, and I guess he's from another planet, but he's a born again Christian, so I guess there's Christianity on other planets, anyway, not much makes sence in this low, low, low, budget film. If it was his first film, I'd cut him some slack, but I think it's his 5th film and it's really bad."
2,Bleech! Felt like a piece of old grandma ribbon candy,"Well I decided to try this product because I received samples of it with another product.Pros:* For a water based lubrication, it lasted quite a while; with and without a condom* Inexpensive for the size bottle I receivedCons:* STICKY!!! After sex, I felt like I dipped my penis in some caramel. I had to keep a wet wash rag next to my bed to immediately wipe off the gunk. Even then it didn't take it all the way offConclusionSpend an extra couple dollars and buy decent lube."
5,Excellent Product,"Purchased a ""06 Mustang GT convertible and the top was in ""good"" condition. Had a few stains and had started to fade. At the back of the top where it meets the trunk (half open) was some accumulated dirt and decomposed leaves. Used the cleaner and it removed all the stains and dirt. Cleaned the rest of the top with a cleaning brush along with the cleaner and rinsed thoroughly. Applied the protectant using a sponge and spraying small areas at a time. Repeated the protectant process and waited for the top to dry. The black top looks fantastic, including the seams and rear area. Have already ordered another bottle of the protectant."
3,Yes and No,Protectant Yes- Cleaner No. Protectant works exceedingly well. As others have mentioned try to avoid contact with windows. I spray directly on the cloth and apply.
3,Looks good,Used once top appears cleaner than with other products. 3 stars as I obviously cannot review its UV protective qualities
5,Black Top,"My 2003 Mustang convertible top was fading and starting to look dingy. Used this product and the car looks so much better! It took two applications for it to really look back to the original, easy to do yourself and makes a world of difference."
4,Raggtopp Convertible Top Care Kit-Vinyl,"Product works as described in litareture. However, to save time you should protect windows when applying the protectant.Product was received in a timely manner."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I bought this on the recommendation of a friend thinking it was a family film. She had seen it on TV which had edited it for TV. I was really disappointed in the language used in this. I would not let my grandchildren see it. I don't understand why they ruin an adoreable film with language you don't want the children to hear.
4,"if you want to joy a movie and have fun, buy it.","Forget this is not the best horror movie, forget this is not an excellent production and masterprice movie. Just get fun and know about the ""ghost"" involved there, guess who's alive and who's death. Try to discover what really happened. Don't waste the time studyng the screenplay, the production, the cameras direction or don't try to find faults. Just follow this story, enter to this mistery and get fun! I love this game. I loved to follow the case. I didn't ned subtitles, I sepak spanish and that's excellent to enjoy more."
1,"THe Most Bad and sad Horror movie, of all time...on CHILe","Jorge Olguin, the director of this, bad piece of horror, Is one of the millions of directors, whit !zero!, CREATIVE!!! , This movie, its a bad example, for the others country, about the chilean cinema, because,Chile have millions of practical and creative people, For example, Andres Wood, director of, ""La Fiebre del loco"" and "" ""historias de futbol.The film is, boring and have million of, cliches, and very, very bad soundtrack, Its not reallyst, I cant, talk more about, this shame, to the cinema, On chile, Much people said the same: ITS one of the WORST CHILEAN MOVIES OF ALL TIME...SANGRE ETERNA, its 100% most HOrrible and WORst, than Angel Negro, directed to for this bad Director,.... Its worst time... see you later, for more, information, about the movie."
3,Dark Changeling,"I like the idea of vampire's being a alien species. But to be frank in this book the main character, A Doctor, seemed more then just confused about his ""taste"" for blood. It seemed to go on forever his denial of who he was. Even after meeting someone of his own kind and all the proof that was presented to him. I got tired and bored with his denials and stopped the book many times. I have to admit I didn't enjoy this book as much as I have others by this author."
2,A wasted talent,"Watch Ian Moore in Concert and the guy will blow you away; Great style and plenty of taste. Listen to his CD's and it is a different story.Again I need to emphasize on the issue that Ian is a great guitar player; the problem in his CD's is the lack of creating great songs.Almost all the tracks are weak and fall short from being melodically complete; the guitar playing is very basic and does not show the real talent of this great guitar player.This CD deserves no more than 2 stars, however after attending many concerts for Ian Moore, I say Ian has lots of potentials and can easily deliver 5 stars CDs; he just needs to work with someone that can write good songs. I hope he will use his talents right one day."
4,pure talent,"WOW, recently found this CD in the attic and after playing it several times have come to the conclusion that Ian Moore is a fantastic axeman. If you enjoy Hendrix inspired electric blues based guitar, he really delivers. So much more moving than SVR or Trower!!"
3,"Decent, but not great","My friends made it sound like this book was The Bible for GMAT prep. This was the first book that I bought, and it definitely helped. But by the end I felt like I had only gained a rudimentary understanding of the material. The material was very basic, and by the end I felt like I needed more practice problems. The comments on here about the CD ROM being buggy are true, too. I found that it was really unpredictable in my PC, and the CD contained some mistakes."
3,"No Keyboard Shortcuts, Scoring System Expired","The product is great. The CD ROM is great. Now that I have taken it, it feels like the real test. However, I have two complaints.One, the CD ROM written portion does not have all of the shortcut keys that the test has. Kaplans version is closer to the original. Maybe my keyboard was messed up, but some of the CTRL+RIGHT ARROW, CTRL+LEFT ARROW, etc. combinations did not work. That actually gives you less time than you think, because you can't control the keyboard as well as the actual test.My second complaint is a big one. The test results have to be uploaded to the Princeton server website to be scored. That is a problem because after three years, the website is no longer able to calculate scores. They expire. The Kaplan CDs are good only with the CD, but nothing else is required and there is no time limit on scoring. So, any Princeton CD that is older than three years is useless if you want an actual score and not a scaled score."
2,"Good ideas, bad practice","This is a great intro to what the GMAT will be like. The math techniques are great - they can save alot of time.CD testing stinks. I could barely read the questions because of the font, the timer seemed to go very quickly (I started the same time my wife began a 30 minute TV show, and my time was out before her show finished), and it didn't give me a score - I have no idea what my GMAT score would be. Oh well, for 30 bucks, it was worth the intro to GMAT - plus I used free shipping and got it in 2 days."
2,Book is so-so and CD is bad,"The tests in the CD are bad, I took 3 of them and it repeated several questions - including the texts for reading comprehension, they were the same in the 3 tests! I also found some answers keys that were certainly incorrect.The book helps you to get on the road and gives some helpful hints. Nevertheless, its style is not academic, and it lacks depth in mathematics and grammar.Overall, if you are targeting to the top MBA's, then you will need a score around the 700's (or higher), and this book will not be enough."
2,Ripped off by Princeton Review,"I bought the book primarily because it comes with the CD sample tests. Well, the problems on the CD are also in the book so you only get to use one or the other to test your skills. In addition to that, the CD tests don't run correctly, don't show the underlines on the sentence correction problems, and score some of the math questions incorrectly. The highest score I got using the CD was 590 but got 730 on the actual test. The CD has no relevence to the GMAT. I e-mailed Princeton Review to explain this. I already know the CDs don't work but continue to sell them. They also were uninterested to know which problems were scored incorrectly. They did send me a new CD they said would work but it arrived 6 days AFTER I took the test. Do not support these guys. They are knowingly selling a broken product.Saving grace was the book. It was actually OK."
3,"Great photos, Page is great.","Tim Page was/is an icon of the tragedy that was Nam. His photos are art, in all its horror, humanity and fear. He, Larry Burrows et al were brave as hell and never lost their professional focus while the rounds snapped past in the air.The text by Page is stark and without apology, hitting the nail on the head and exposing Nam, and all war for what it was / is. However, his publishers included his great photos without specific caption explanations of when and where each exposure was taken, and I would like to have known that.Page was a real hero, coming back to the job aftet his many wounds. I doubt many of us would have had the moxie to do that. Wouldn't it be good if we could send all of the politicians that voted for war, to go out and actually shoulder an M-16? I bet wars would cease to be mans great curse. Guys like Page expose war for the horror show it is."
2,Nothing Special,"This was a solid effort by this photographer that has basically made his career out of the Viet Nam war. I thought the pictures were interesting and somewhat dramatic, but there was nothing that moved me a great deal. This is not a book that you will show off to each new person that comes to your house; it is a good overview of the war. If you are looking for a brief, general book then this is for you."
1,dont't order from source media,"i got at a dvd of dx, dx new and improved,a 3 disc set. the first disc one worked fine, the second disc was blank and would not even come on, the third disc skiped,if you can get what you need from ANYONE else save yourself some grief. I called amazon.com and they where very helpful and solved the problem. my new disc of the dx new and improved is on it's way. thank you amazon.com"
5,two words for ya!,I already got this movie back when it came out but I got again here for my friend because it was his birthday and he's been wanting this from me for awhile.But any way great return of DX of 2006 through 2007 pretty funny I still wish I had the Vince loves you know what t shirt.three disks of the usual never ending feud of DX the spirit squad with Vince an Shane McMahon and then on disk 3 it changes to a feud with Edge and Orton pretty good but I liked seeing the funny ass jokes about Vince loves cock the thing thaat will have you rolling on the floor is either when triple h and Shawn Michaels make fun of the McMahons(Vince and Shane)or when they try to get the Cocky mascott for Vince.overall really good three disk set of DX and the case has a play action of card board triple h and Shawn Michaels with little pull action that makes them do the famous crotch chop.LOL.peace out.
5,The New & Improved DX,this was an awsome dvd on the new dx with very clips for almost every some they where on
2,Eh.,It's just ok. I kind of feel I could have gotten the same results from a tub of generic petroleum jelly for .99 cents at wal-mart. Cute vintage-style tin is certainly nicer to pull out of your bag instead of vaseline though...LOL It smells rather nice but I would have liked the fragrance to be stronger. It's not bad but it's not fab either.
5,"Love, clones, and a whole lot more...","Cherryh composes a wonderful story of intregue, love that runs deeper than life, hate that spans families and political relms, life that extends beyond belief, death that is never permenant, and many worlds all to explain the story of two brothers: Justin Warrick, a brilliant programmer, and Grant ALX, his brother brought up as an azi (clone) and refuses to understand his brother's illogic. Overall, a wonderful book."
4,visiting CJ world,"I have read many books by CJ Cherryh, she is one of my favorite authors. Her characters are what draws me. She leaves enough to my imagination to allow me to get to know them and form my own opinions. This latest book is a political side of Cyteen culture, cloned individuals and made men, and the values their culture places on them. This book was meant to be read prior to Down Below Station with her new book Regenesis to be a sequil, 40 thousand in Gienna is kind of a parallel as it explores the Azi and their culture as throw aways. I admit that each of these company books makes me feel like I am missing something and need to read more to catch up. The one thing I have noticed with CJ Cherryh's writing however is the basic human story underneath all the action and intrigue that keeps me coming back and looking for more."
3,SLOW TO IMPULSE,"If Cherryh's other merchanter books are at warp speed, this one is definitely at impulse. It explains the mysterious Union in almost excruciating detail. The characters are human and realistic, but the plot is very slow-moving by Cherryh's usual standards. Still worth the read."
2,Nope!,"Good idea but too long because unnecessarily trying to be too complex. Poor characterization - if you think Justin's constant whinings is characterization that's another matter. The overlong political intrigue is bland and because of that the book misses the point (cloning and slavery) altogether. It ends up with a ""surprise ending"" which makes you think ""so what?!""."
5,This really is a great book,"One of the best things I've read over the past five years. An incredible novel, intense fascinating, and mind bending in the way good science fiction is. You like the characters, but they aren't like you, moral differences, deep intellectual difference, they think differently, and they respond differently, and the azi are different in deeply important ways. And then the question of the grand aim being pursued. It is an absolutely brilliant work of fiction which I really loved."
1,"Slow, very slow","I know I'm the bah-humbug here, everyone else seemed to like it. Someone gave this book 5 stars even though it was slow to start. For me, it was so slow I put it down and couldn't pick it up again."
1,"Slow, choppy writing style, boring plot","If I could give it a - 0 - star, I would. For two years I've been trying to pick up this book and get past the first 50 pages and can't seem to do it.There's too much going on in the beginning. No characterization. I could care less about the government or the people in whatever convulated plot Cherryh is trying to call drama. And if anyone could help me out with finding the entertainment in the book, feel free to email me.Now if you want a real author, read Joan D. Vinge's Snow Queen and Psion series. Now that is drama."
1,Not for a 20-30 pages a day reader,"If your judgement is not clouded by being a big fan of author novels or Merchanter Series, in particular, you will not like this book. The characters are typical for Cherryh's books - not stable in their ideas, illogical, etc. The novel is packed with intrigues, double crossing, triple crossing. Moreover, the book is very slow - never mind the size of 700 pages - it has nothing to do with it, there is just not much happening, in the middle of this novel ,in particular. So, if you just read about an hour a day, you will have to be VERY, VERY patient to finish this novel, and there is not any payoff in the end !! I would not recommend this book to anybody, besides the loyal fans of Cherryh works, and those of you, who are going through the Hugo list."
1,What ever happened to editors?,"I just quit reading this book. I just couldn't put up with the muddled language and tortured grammar anymore. Aren't editors supposed to fix these problems? All of the supposed political wranglings are rendered almost totally ineffective because the various factions are murky and their interests are never explained properly. I think this is because in the real world these interests would not have much (if anything) to fight about. Cherryh makes all of their interactions confusing because he/she has to at least pay lip service to having a plot in the book. I also got the impression that the author was desperately trying to prognosticate future genetics dilemnas and thereby show him/herself to be a hip, savvy, sci-fi writer."
1,This is not sci-fi,"This book may be set in a different star system, but it is not science-fiction. It is all politics and moralizing. The book is TERRIBLY SLOW paced. At the start the author introduces dozens of factions and characters. You will be confused. This is a nice book if you cannot sleep at night. Start reading this and you will have problems staying awake.If you want to try Cherryh, start with Donbelow Station. At least that book is mercifully short, but it is typical Cherryh: NO PLOT."
1,"Got halfway through, didn't bother to finish it.","50 pages into the book, I had well over three dozen names, a half dozen factions, still nothing in the way of plot or character development to help tie it all together.It didn't get much better from there.This is more of a political intruigue book than anything else. And not in the good sense of Dune or the Foundation novels. No, this reads like CSPAN with color commentary: committees, legislative bodies, back-room negotiations, press releases, and stock market updates.Must have been a bad year for the Hugo selection committee."
4,More human than Truman or Ender.,"This is the ""young/exploited genius"" book you should give your kids ,especially your daughters, when they go to college or maybe earlier if they're mature. Second Ari is raised, & genetically bred, to be a dictator. Yet she turns out to be both that & not-that. Unlike Ender's the emotions seemed real instead of stylized to ""grip"" us. So it isn't as memorable, but ultimately it's better.Also inspiring is that it goes against this genetic determinism & blank slatism going on today. Genetics does give you potentials & ""rules"", but who says you can't play by the rules & do great things? Maybe the rules we have would be better than making up them unthinkingly as we go along. Just a thought. Who knows?My only complaint is that Cherryh's plots are overcomplicated & can confuse the uninitiated reader. Thereby losing the book some affect."
2,Oil pressure gauge,"This item is just OK, It is hard to read in day light. Night time reading is fine. This is a inexpensive guage and I find it hard to get a quality item like this no matter what the price is. It seems everything made now days is just cheap junk. What happened to ""Made In America With Pride"" We need to get back our country and start making stuff here ... stuff that works for a long time !!!"
2,"Flashy Graphics, but no more.","I recently tried out Sheep and had a few negative comments to express. Sure, the gameplay is cute and all, but after an hour of trying to keep sheep out of poison, fire, and dancing bazookas, it loses that deco-cute touch. For one, the controls are funky and a bit hard to get accustomed to. For another, the gameplay is strictly herding sheep. Sure, there are four ""breeds"" of sheep, and four ""herders,"" like BoPeep, a 3D Anime creation, but the different variations prove to be monotonous none the less. If you are looking for an amusing game, this game is fine for a few hours."
3,Sheep was ok......,"I thought Sheep was an ok game. The graphics are pretty good, but I personally thought that certain games, such as the sims, were better. The largest problem was the glitches. When I play it, my computer, a mac OS 9, either freezes after 15-20 minutes, or crashes. The game itself is fun, but I would not buy it until they make patches for it."
2,Poor example,"No CDP section, missing a few topics, some examples aren't explained properly and lastly many mistakes.I expect more from Cisco press.Save your money and read white papers and caveats on CCO"
4,CCIE study,"This book is very good for consultation, but is necessary to have knowledge on the boarded subjects for it. The key notes are all that you need to know for the test."
5,Awesome,Wendell's books are still good refrence and operational manuals for practictioners and teachers alikeDavid
3,It's OK,"Was I hoping for too much? mmm maybe.The whole blueprint is covered here (well almost) but there are some things that are missing, and oh ... the mistakes. My girlfriend is going through the trauma now of CCIE and she is using it as a guide. I see that the Web site has come up with an errata fixing a couple of the mistakes, but others are missed. What happened to CDP using SNAP frames? How do we make On demand routing work without it? Are you sure EIGRP uses that multicast address? bit of a booboo with vtp too. Oh and the diagram of InvArp and frame-relay is bizzare, the configs dont match the diagram, then three pages later you talk about and configure dlci's and there is no frame config on the diagram.But it's ok, i guess your going to get mistakes. Just don't think that this one has all the answers and it's error free."
2,This is a very good book in question answer format.,Excellent book for question practice and core concept explained very well
4,The grinch great Christmas gift.,"I bought the grinch computer game after seeing the movie with my children. It was a great holiday game addition for the computer. My 14 year old girl also thought it was pretty entertaining. It seems to be one of those for adults and kids to do together or seperately. My son, liked the things the grinch could do and trying to beat the levels. I recommend this game to anyone who is a grinch lover of old. I have always loved the grinch and so do my kids now. Enjoy this game with the relatives at Christmas too."
4,Too Much,"I am a grinch fan, and this game was really fun, but at times it was really frusterating because it was hard to figure out what to do in the game. I reccomend this game for people really interested in playing, not traditional fans or smaller children (under 10-12). It is fun to be the grinch and has good ideas, but is nearly impossible."
4,Tracklist in photo section,Dance Dance Dance til ya can't dance anymore. Find the tracklist for this circular wonderfulness in the customer image section. Don't mention it...
3,So-so,"In Florida it doesn't get as cold as it does up north, but when it gets even in the 60's and less; you freeze [personally]. My heat [air handler-heat strip] went out and the relay was the cause, X-ref'd to this and bought it. A month later I'm ordering another one off E-bay because this one failed. Worked for a while but, one month only??"
5,The Best,"This is one of the best Albums of the Year! I like hearing the instrumentals and some of the gorgeuos new songs. I keep coming back to this album again and again. The band just keep getting better and better. Yes, I'm looking forward to their next album but, how can anyone complain about this fantastic disc?"
2,No!,"Maybe it's my fault. Because of Angela McClusky's vocals on Telepopmusic Genetic World, I bought ""This Can't Be Life"", ""Fruit of Life"", and ""Reel Life"". I am sorry, they are not at all what I expected. You don't know until it's too late. If you insist, then take my advise and buy only one at a time."
4,Don't let this one pass you by,"A pleasant surprise. Given the variety of songs and stunning vocals on his last Album, Don't Give Up on Me, I wasn't sure what the King would do as a follow up. But after listening to the new album twice I can testify that he hits the mark quite often here. His anguished wail on ""It makes no difference"" and his soulful pleas on Fading Footsteps prove once again that this guy sings from the heart and soul. And if you have any doubts about his place in music history, just listen to him tear up the Hank Williams tune ""Wealth won't save your soul"". Don't let this one pass you by."
2,You Can Teach a Bear to Dance,"You can teach a bear to dance, but don't expect him to enjoy it or look good doing it. It's hard to believe after the excellent ""Don't Give Up on Me"" (5 stars), anyone could make a Solomon Burke CD this bad. From the first notes of the first cut, I said to myself ""Oh no"". First there's the terrible mismatch of the material/arrangements which has Solomon's wonderful voice stretched to the breaking point on virtually every cut. Then there's the uninspired musicianship of the backing instumentals. And finally, even the back-up singers are often shrill and seldom mellow. This is my first review for Amazon & I'm doing it so that those who loved ""Don't Give Up on Me"" won't make the same mistake I did & buy ""Make Do with What You've Got"". If you bought this one first, don't give up on Solomon, just back up in time a little, or a lot."
3,Not as good as Don't Give Up On Me,"This old guy definitely can sing. However, this CD miss the freshness and intensity of the predesessor, his comeback CD Don't Give Up On Me"
2,not enough soul in the music,"This is a fair cd, at best, a good way to know if you like the cd you got is would you buy it again, no, theres maybe 5 songs that are good, not great, and the other ones are ok, which ok is not good enough for 15.00 bucks, every song should be good, and this is not, the fast songs are good but you hear B B King in a lot of the songs, so if you want a cd that sounds like B B King than buy one, the real one , save your money"
2,Deeply Disapointing,"Have you ever seen a sequel where all the key elements of the original film are repeated but nothing new is added and you walk away disapointed? I'm sad to say that is the overall vibe on Solomon Burke's followup to his Grammy winning ""Don't Give Up On Me"" album. His vocals are great as ever but there are no great songs and Don Was's antiseptic production robs the album of it's predecesssor's dark, late night intimacy.To make a long story short ,I played this three times and sold it back on Amazon. Sorry Solomon, I just wasn't feeling this one."
3,"Disappointed in the power/ ""magic Dry,"" but otherwise practical.","If you live in a low water pressure area, stay away... Chicago is known for its vast supply of clean drinking water, and i have no problem taking a pressure cooker shower, but i still had trouble getting this thing to crank like they'd make you think it would. It still needs you to towel the car, etc as you would with any other method... though its almost as if they have you think you WONT have to have any towel or own anything BUT this autodry system gadget. It works, there arent streaks, just be aware you aren't gonna walk around your car with this 4 times (rinse, soap, rinse, autodry) and then go lounge with a Corona and stare at your car do the rest. The days of car washing are not over, just a BIT more convenient."
4,Godsend for SoCal... but,"This unit works exactly as advertised. The filter removes most of the minerals from the water, so the car dries almost spot-free. I live in Southern CA and our water is really HARD. Washing a car then leaving it to dry results in the car being covered with white spots and sheets. Drying the car with towels prevents the spotting, but leaves a whitish film over the car. You have to wax the car with a cleaner wax to get the film off. With the filtered water, there are very few spots. My only real complaint is that our water is so hard that a ""10 use"" filter will only last 2 washes, 3 maximum. After that, the filter is full and the car is covered with spots anyway. But that is the fault of our water, not the filter. It's just a shame that it's days are numbered as it is getting harder and harder to find replacement filters. I'll sure miss mine."
1,"DON'T BUY, CAN'T GET REPLACEMENT FILTERS ANYWHERE!!!","I have been a loyal Mr. Clean Autodry customer for 4 years, loved it but now you have to overpay to get replacement filters and soap. Great product that P&G doesn't support, so you need to go to eBay or Amazon and pay more than we did when it was in Kmart. The current sellers got this product from wholesale liqidators at 10% cost and now you need to pay through the nose to get the stuff you need to make this work."
1,Mr. Clean Pro Series Car wash,"I was very upset about the way this order was handled. I get a letter telling me that you were unable to locate this product, over a month after I ordered it. I could give you 10 sites you could find this item, which I will go to one of those sites to do that."
1,Unoriginal,"This book is very unoriginal. It is very simplistic and coins terms that even a 13 year old is familiar with i.e. antibacterial soap- this is not a term that was developed in prison, contrary to the intentions of the writer who contends that this dictionary will give guards insight into the lingo discussed in prison. Moreover, this book is not the first of it kind see Angela Devline's ,Prison Patter: A dictionary of Prison Words and Slangs and Gary K. Farlow's Prison-Ese: A Survivor's guide to Prison Slang both released in 1996 and 2002 respectively."
4,corrections professional,"The dictionary was informative,it cover correction professional in the 21st Century. Corrections in the 21st Century cover more than just prisons, Corections cover camps, courts, Hospitals,jails,Halfway Houses,ect. The dictionary is up to date for the 21st Century."
1,"Big Red, not so big with me",Well I had to try it based on the rave reviews. Glad I only purchased 12 cans ... I just don't like this stuff at all(can't give them away fast enough)... Tastes like carbonated perfume to me. If you want a REALLY DELICIOUS creme soda try Hansens Cherry Vanilla Creme. Now THAT is a GREAT creme soda
5,Big Red - Absolutely the Best!!,"Big Red - the unofficial soda of Texas is excellent. It's hard to pinpoint the exact taste; some say bubble gum, while others compare it to cherry. Regardless, you should definitely give this a try. Best tasted cold - you won't regret. I only wish it was distributed in New England."
5,quality cookware,Works great on my induction stove. Easy cleanup. Love that there are no rivets inside to clean! I can live with the hollow handle and small handle on the lid. You definitely pay for good quality. I didn't want to pay even more for the Atlantis line which is gorgeous and even higher quality.
1,Worst Than Plan-9 !!,"My, my, my.... Where do I begin.....? There are 5 movies on my list of all time worst movies ever made. This movie ""Psycho A Go-Go"" is number 5 and deserves it. The only reason to view this movie is if you are passed-out drunk. That's it. No other reason. I'd give it -5 Stars, if I could. But the other 4 that actually beat this one, are: #4 ""Plan-9 From Outer Space"", #3 ""Beast Of Yucca Flats"", #2 ""The Killer Shrews"", and the number one worst movie of all time ever made is: #1 ""Cornman"". If you are bored and desperately need a little entertainment please see ""Little Voice"" or ""Flirting With Disaster""."
3,"Good for biking, but not as jogger","I bought this bike trailer/jogger combo after my jogging stroller was stolen. I had planned to buy a bike trailer any way, so I thought this would be a good solution. It works great as a bike trailer, but is not nearly as steady for a jogger. The front wheel is very small not not great for going up and down curbs and pretty wobbly. It seats two kids comfortably and allows them to get in and out quickly. I also miss my cup holder and the child tray from my old jogging stroller very much. A friend of mine just bought a slightly more expensive combo stroller/trailer from Costco and it seems much more sturdy"
1,Quick N' Lite Has One Major Flaw,"After careful research, my husband and I bought the Quick N' Light because we thought would be perfect for our needs (light weight, doubles as a jogging stroller, relatively inexpensive, etc.). We used it in the city on paved roads, side walks, and paved bike trails but found our child COVER WITH ROCKS AND DIRT after returning from our ride. The mesh screen in the front allows rocks for fly though the screen and hit the child. If you put the plastic rain guard down over the front it allows for no ventilation inside because the side windows are only plastic. It's aweful. Our child got small rocks in her hair, eyes, and all over her body. I would never recommend this item to any one."
3,Loud and Clear.. where's the bass?,"I just got a pair of the white 8002's (8"" 1-sided tubbie) and found them to be fairly bright with very little bass. If you really crank them they deliver a super loud and distortion free sound, though. I was surprised how loud and clear they were. They do have a little punch at that volume level (over 90db) but if you just want some background music, these sound pretty tinny because they highs are a lot louder than the bass.I wanted to use these as patio speakers but they won't do in that setting. If you're on a boat and there is a lot of noise, and you crank these really loud, I think they'd work. But compared to other outdoor speakers these are not well suited to low volume listening...-C"
4,Great movies; cheap packaging,"This DVD set is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, you get four good-to-excellent movies. ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" are both classics, and ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and ""The Train Robbers"" are nice additions. On the other hand, the packaging and presentation are very cheap. Instead of four discs each containing one movie, there are two double-sided discs that seem to have been haphazardly made. I had to immediately take back the first copy of this set I bought and exchange it, because one of the discs was badly scratched.The sad thing is that this could easily be a 5-star set, especially with the inclusion of ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" which is a very underrated film and possibly Robert Altman's best. I would hope that TCM will pay more attention to the quality of their products in the future."
2,Poor Quality,"These jackets are not good quality...I purchased these & I returned them the next day, they have a yellow tint to them & the clarity of these diamonds are very poor...Pay a little more & you can get a better pair, read my other review on the pair that I bought & kept...Sometimes its worth it to go the extra mile, especially when it comes to buying diamonds...You get what you pay for!!!"
2,Um...... Sort Of Strange,"I'm not sure why I read this book, it's kind of young, but I did, and it was a bit odd. Horses can smell things pretty well, I guess, but I have never known one that could find animals.This was a cute story for little kids with lots of imagination, but I wouldn't exactly call it realistic. Which is fine, fantasy is great, but I don't think the author was intending to be whimsical."
1,Not well made,The quality of the DVD was so bad that I could not stand to watch it. When I contacted the seller they agreed to take it back.
4,Worth The Five Bucks!,"A good retrospective of The Residents' 30 prolific years. A nice to have for serious fans who don't want to shuffle play through a number of CDs to hear their favorite Residents tunes. Plus, the sneak preview tracks from ""Demons Dance Alone"" makes this CD well worth the low price."
2,Not near as good as it could be.,"I got this as a gift from Amazon.com. I have been using Axialis Screen Saver Producer 3.5 which can use gifs, any type picture and audio file as well as Flash and other type videos. This program is so limited and Screen Saver Producer is about the same price. Compare the two before you buy. I do professional graphics, so take it for what it's worth."
1,BEWARE!!,"I brought these skewers thinking they were the regular size. NOT!! these things are the size of toothpicks, absolutely ridiculous!!! I should have known better when this item did not have any detailed information."
5,works great,"got this for a caprese kabob. the ends have a sightly sharpened point. didn't have any problems spearing small blocks of salami. none broke while i was assembling it. out of the whole package of 50 - there were many 2 where the ends were unraveled. which was totally fine. the ends are tied loosely so one can expect it to be 100% tied. the length was perfect for one mozerellla ball, grape tomatoe, basil and a block of salami with room for maybe 3 more grape tomato if you want. i ordered again for another party. makes a great appetizer presentation"
5,im from y-town,"igrew up with lead singer of the band in youngstown ohio (booker newberry) and got to listen to alot of their jam sessions they were great. this cd is a classic ito wish i could get their second cd. from y-town ohio, peace out the bruman"
1,The type is too small in this horrible reproduction,"This review concerns the BiblioLife edition only, and does not address the content of the text. I just wanted to warn others that the type in this book is extremely small, small enough that many people may need magnification to read it. The book is actually a reproduction of an 1842 edition, and a poor reproduction at that: some of the pages are printed annoyingly askew, some pages have blurred text, and on some pages BiblioLife has actually printed the underlines and other marks made by whoever used the original copy of the 1842 edition.This edition of Godwin's text is practically useless, and definitely not worth $20."
3,"Eclectic mix of folk, funk and progressive...","A very eclectic mix of folk, funk and progressive. Much of it is very stripped down and most of the vocals are strangely mixed below both the acoustic or electric guitar. Maceo Parker is on half the album and Prince does vocals on one song. I found it a pretty mixed bag."
3,actually 3 and 1/2 stars!,"ok i must say i was disappointed in this album, as with the last one, Upupupupupup......i think it's cool that ani is changing and growing and experimenting with new styles, but it's just not as good as her older stuff. a few high points though....i like the song with prince, and backbackback, there's a few other good songs too. i wouldn't recommend this cd to first time ani fans though, stick with puddle dive or maybe little plastic castle. i hope that this is just a lower point in ani's career and she starts making really good music again, cause this is good, but just doesn't compare to what she is capable of."
5,"A new sound, but still awesome","This album is very different then her others, but I still like it. It's not one of my favorites, and I would recommend ""Out of Range"" before this one. A powerful message, as always, she delivers a nice album. Overall, two thumbs up for an origional and powerful album."
1,Ani stinks,She has the worst voice I've ever heard. How anyone can take her seriously is completely incomprehensible to me. Her lyrics are childish - like bad 8th grade poetry. You stink ANI!
3,"No one compares, but this album is sadly lacking","No one could convince me that there is another musical performer as powerful as Ani, but this album lacks so much of her energy and ""rrrrah"" that is packed into so many of her earlier albums. I greatly miss the effect that songs like ""born a lion"", ""i'm no heroine"", ""blood in the boardroom"", ""iq"", and ""every state line"" continue to have on me (even now). On her most recent cd, she seems to whisper through many of the songs and the musical accompaniment often takes away from the lyrical content. After listening to the cd several times I find that I have grown to appreciate the music, but it has sadly fallen short of the kind of music I expect from Ani."
3,Wishing for a better tomorrow,"I'm a devout Ani fan, and compared to her previous albums, this one just isn't up to Ani code. She is a musical genius; an inspiration. Her words touch everyone in unique ways, and although her lyrics are a masterpiece on this album, this new style isn't wasn't was I, as well as others, were expecting. I believe she is just keeping her options open, I just hope we can expect the next album to be as excellently written as Little Plastic Castle and Puddle Dive."
2,Buy Dilate or Not a pretty girl or Up up up up up up,"Ani has finally pulled it off. She has made an album I do not like. I think I understand what she is trying to do, but it just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong this album is still way better than avarage. But it does not show her real talents. My advice is buy Dilate or Not a pretty Girl!"
2,not that good,i've followed her music for a few years and some things work and some don't.i like her more acoustic stuff best.this album tries to hard to be catchy and it isn't her style.
3,Self indulgent musical rants- At least its Ani's,"I respect Ani second to none. Needless to say this cd sounds like the result of alot of studio time and dope smoking. Is that to harsh? I love Ani and am sure this cd will grow on me, but I am dying for some of the playful, powerful, and passionate songs that have rocked my world for years. Lay down the joint Ani."
1,(agree with mark) NO ONE REALLY LIKES THIS ONE,"Honestly, this is not one of her best. Only played 1x, then sat on a shelf for a year. I finally sold it on Half-dot-com. If you like funky jazz, get a disc from LIQUID SOUL. They know how to do it right. This album sounds like Ani got stoned one afternoon and just started recording anything. Not a single memorable song. Sorry, I don't know any Ani fans who enjoyed this."
1,"come on, nobody REALLY likes this cd","and the ones that say they do must start listening to some other artist, ANY other artist soon. kudos to ani for following her muse, but god knows it must be hers alone because these meandering boring pseudo jazz tracks have nothing to say to anyone else and isnt that what ani wants anyway? why should she be a spokesperson for you? and to the people who hang on and smile & say ""oh yeah its so great, it SPEAKS to me"" while secretly muttering ""boy i hope she does another out of range soon because i'm bored stiff by this"", dont be so sensitive. you wont be abadoning her, you'll be thinking for yourself! hooray for self improvement!!"
5,She never fails to live up to my expectations....,I rushed out to buy this on its first day of release. Its every bit as good as I hoped it would be. She seems a little more grounded in her classic roots of stunning guitar riffs and political lyrics. Damn the man. To the teeth is a great song truly reflecting the way that many of us feel about the approaching millenium. Hello birmingham is touching and disturbing at the same time. And Ani gets down with her bad self with the funky and catchy Arrivals Gate. Definitley her most impressive release of new material since dilate. The jazzy rythyms that we've been hearing in her last couple albums are still there but more seasoned and subtle. Truly a work of art........GO BUY IT NOW!
4,Awesome!,"Saw Ani in Getttysburg, PA and was blown away by the new stuff. Freak Show is unbelievable and very catchy. Back Back Back is one that you can just sit and chill out listening to. And To the Teeth is the only song I can get my mother to listen to and say she actually likes it! What a triumph! This CD is certainly a departure, but I think it is amazing . . . as usual. Highly recommended. Reason I said a 4, is because I want to see what comes up next!"
4,"Not typical of Ani, but she took a giant leap!","I have listened to Ani for years and have always loved the rawness in her acoustical talent. ""To the Teeth"" slowly grew on me. From the heartfelt ""Providence"" featuring Prince to her corroboration with Maceo Parker in ""Swing"", Ani yet again pulls throught to impress us with her astounding lyrics and soulful gurrrlrock. If you can appreciate Ani's LPC, then I would recommend this record. If you would much rather hear Ani at her best, fan or not, your best bet would be ""Living in Clip""."
5,This is DEFINITELY her best studio album.,"I will have to admit that ""To the Teeth"" is easily Ani DiFranco's best studio album. ""Little Plastic Castle,"" ""Dilate"" and ""Not a Pretty Girl"" are close calls, yet they do not maintain the consistent emotion that is found only on ""To the Teeth.""Songs like ""Soft Shoulder"" and ""Cloud Blood"" hit me the hardest. They are beautiful and heartbreaking songs and I swear that if you ever hear those songs live, it will be the pivotal moment in your life.""To the Teeth"" is a very moody album for it ranges from heavily orchestrated tunes like ""Going Once"" to the deep sadness of ""Soft Shoulder."" It is also a lengthy album. Many of the songs are longer than six minutes in length and the total album length is nearly 72 minutes. This is definitely Ani's best and easily one of the best albums of 1999."
5,That's the Point,"Of course this album is ""different"". Of course it's a ""departure"". That's what's so outrageously beautiful about Ani and her art. She keeps growing. Every new album makes me excited for the next. ""To the Teeth"" is no exception. ""Soft Shoulder"", on its own, is worth every top 40 hit of the past 3 years. Thank you Ani."
4,"Ani's new CD - different, but brilliant","Ani Difranco, the unique folk/rock/blah/blah singer. The genre for this album is Ani. Her varied vocals, and intelligent and witty lyrics, are warmly delivered on this album. Ani introduces new styles, instruments and artists to this album, which although is a dramatic change to her style, is a very good album. The first time I listened to this album, her third of 1999, I was unsure if I particularly liked it. Upon a second listen, I enjoyed it even more and each time I listen to it, it reveals new perspectives. I think that for Ani fans, and for people who have never heard of her, this is an ideal album. However, new fans should also listen to Living in Clip, and Not a Pretty Girl. These three albums show Ani's whole image - smart, talented and powerful."
5,To The Teeth is nearly ani's best.,"I got an advanced copy of this cd 3 weeks before it came out...so yea, i've heard this a billion times already. To The Teeth takes a few listens to get into, but once you've given it a fair listen, you realize what an incredible artist mrs difranco really is. I swear, ani gets better with every cd. To The Teeth is the best to date in my opinion."
5,Musical Genius,"Being only a new Ani fan, and purchasing Living in Clip as the first to my collection, I grew very fond of Ani immediately! However, after purchasing Up up up up up, I was left confused, as that album didn't click with me! I then bought Little Plastic Castle, and it was love at first hear! To the teeth was then released...and it confirmed everything; Ani is a living musical genius! I can listen to the album hours at end, and not get bored. Every listening is a new venture for me...you always pick up on something new that you didn't hear the previous time. 'In my humble opinion, here's what I suggest you do:' BUY THIS ALBUM, and indulge. It is one of the greatest musical works I have ever heard!"
4,Ani is Badass,Who would've ever thought Ani could pull off a few songs that borderline on electronic?Arrival Gate is really great though.Although I tend to prefer Ani's more raw stuff like Imperfectly and Out of Range this CD still blows most other artists' music out of the water.Definitely should buy.
3,Well-written but a little dull,"What happened to the Ani who constantly broke guitar-strings and forced critics to invent the term ""folk-punk""? She isn't on display here. Leaving behind songs like ""Napoleon"" and ""Light of Some Kind"", Ani has decided to embrace woozy saxophones and wah-wah keyboard effects. Think of ""Come Away from It"", from Up Up Up Up Up. The lyrics are piercing as ever, but in general this is okay coffeehouse music. She never gets up the courage even to rock as hard as other jazzy artists, like Steely Dan, and great songs like ""Cloud Blood"" are lost in the general jazz-folk miasma."
5,hello? it's ani - of course it's good!,well - if you don't already know this is ani's best album yet! it is an example of how much she has grown as an artist and progressed as a music maker. as always her lyrics are simply magical and inspirational... but with her new band and a couple of guest appearances TTT is her greatest album. i own every album that her name graces and it is my opinion that this album is truly her finest piece of work! it's more jazzy and hip-hoppy than her other works but her voice is more angelic and fierce than ever..all i can say is buy this and you'll see why ani is the best singer song writer of today! oh yeah.. and if you are like me.. you will be waiting anxiously for her next album - which i am confident will be just as good or (hard to imagine0 better! thanks! and take care and stay safe!
3,Ani Difranco......to the teeth,"Ani explores the depth of her musical talent in this CD, With the help of the artist formally known as Prince, and other artists, you relive the Ani Difranco world all over again. Although this is not her best CD, she explores another type of music, with a little less of the folk attitude. That is okay, because if you are a true Ani fan, you will support her, whatever phase she is in......."
5,much to sink your teeth into,"This quick succession to the soft, soothing strains of the UpUpUp album is not only a relief in the more aggressive improvisational style, but it also is complementary to that album. Ani is moving away from the strumming, concise, witty folk song, in a slow and multi-faceted journey towards a lush texture of musical sound and subtle variations of style that continues to embrace various genres like jazz and rap which make you want to get up and move or participate in some way into this engaging collection. Although at times a bit jarring, because she filters everything new through her own unique voice and background, this music will slowly weave its way into the back of your mind with heartfelt lyrics surprisingly sharp and ordinary at the same time, making her older albums more rich with the new addition."
2,Downhill since dilate.,"I have every ani album, and i must say dilate was her last consistently excellent album. every cd since then has its moments, but none of them are as inspired as the old days. a word to ani; lose the tijuana brass, you are much more powerful with just you and your guitar. I recommend new ani fans to go for the old stuff, 'like i said' is a good place to start enjoying the righteous music. To the teeth has too much commercialism, not enough actual content. Also, who told that guy he could rap? ""sweeping you off your feet like we had a broom"" ? words that trite and lame don't belong anywhere near the name ani difranco, even in these, her declining days . . ."
3,Not as good as the other Ani albums,"I was extremely dissapointed with ""To the Teeth"". While I appreciate Ani's attempt at moving her music forward, this album really lacks the power that something like ""Not a Pretty Girl,"" or ""Little Plastic Castles"" has."
1,a mistake,"i used to be somewhat of a big ani difranco fan, so i was pretty excited for this album. i had heard ""to the teeth"" performed live before the studio release (which i liked), so i was thinking that the rest of this album would be great.sadly, ""to the teeth"" and ""hello birmingham"" are the ONLY two good songs on this album. the rest, to put it nicely, are just plain bad. in fact, ""freak show"" gave me a smashing headache.i think that ani is striving for quanity and not quality. her earlier releases (like ""imperfectly"" and ""out of range"") are so so good! but her latest efforts have been a disappointment. i think that she needs to slow down and only market songs of quality. she *is* a talented songwriter, and this album does NOT showcase that."
2,a very disappointing cd - abandoning your roots much ani?,"I am so upset by this CD...i expected something amazing as I always do from an Ani CD but this was horrible. Anticipating some ""old school"" ani, I bought the CD with excitement but what I ended up hearing was this weird, experimental music that made me cringe. What ever happened to the folksinger with her acoustic guitar? I'm a sad girl..:("
3,new year,"Well, i guess that she is changing her style because this is taking up up up up up one step further. It has taken me awhile to get used to the last one, but i think that in a couple of months that i will like it, it just is different from her old stuff, musically... but the words are just as good!"
5,Johnny rules,"Some CDs don't wear well with repeated hearings, but Roadmaster just gets better and better. Johnny Charles is one of the best guitarists you'll ever hear - listen to how smooth he plays on ""When the Sun Goes Down"" or the hip comping on ""Park Avenue Swing."" This is a great CD."
2,A boring CD,"Sorry to say so, but a Stratocaster and long hair do not make a rock star or a blueser. Frankly said, I was quite disappointed. Ian Moore is brushing the strings nicely and he is able to play burning solos, though they sound all very similar with a lot of WahWah. What I don't like is the voice of Ian Moore, it was far too young way back in 1993 - he neither had the deep harsh rumble of Jonny Lang nor the tasty ""Schmalz"" of John Bon Jovi. That's exactly were Ian Moore is between. Despite the rock-attitude with its Na-Na-Hey-Hey-songs, it does not reach the quality of rocking blues like BIG SUGAR or JOE BONAMASSA and blues only needs somewhat more of a feeling, not only while singing. I do not know his works of today yet. I hope he approved his style."
4,"Great blues rock, good voice","I had this album on my shelf for years (along with Modernday Folklore) and I just broke them out again; I forgot how good they are. I can't stop playing them right now. He really knows how to break it up by picking up the pace and slowing it down. I bought if for ""Blue Sky"" which was played on the radio at the time but the others are great, too. ""Harlem"" is your socially conscious rock tune, but one great piece of music."
2,The Mummy,Not worth [the money]Robotic gameplay and a confusing perspective make this game difficult to adjust to from standard FSP play. Almost mouse interface at all.
1,horrible!,just plain horrible! the graphics are the worst! I would not recommend anyone buying this game!
2,Wake me when the game is over.,"I had high expectations for this game. People here on Amazon have given it high ratings, so I immediatly rushed out to get it. Boy, was I dissapointed. The story is not clear at the beginning (unless they expect you to know it follows the film), the graphicsa are easy to tell they were ported from a console, and the save system is just plain bad. Each time you enter a new level, it autosaves for you. The draw-distance, is well, drawn bad. You can only see about 10ft in front of you. And to top it off, the impersonated voice-acting is terrible. Rick O'Connell sounds like an English man with a head-cold. The only good thing is the soundtrack, which is ripped right from the films. I don't recommend this to anyone with a taste in games, because this has everything that a bad game does, except the music."
5,Faboulus coulnt have been better,It was challenging and also very fun you could use machine guns and also has movie clips that are realy long
4,Modern trends,"A mix of different music video-clips by artists not so well popular round a globe presents an opportunity to broad knowledge of young music talents.It seems, bonus futures listed on jacket differ from those on a disc not bearing ""2007"" confusingly. A different region not provided also just adds to lowering a mark of this DVD-produce at whole."
3,"Strange and watchable, but pointless","Things get strange when two Japanese gangsters (Hideki Sone and Sho Aikawa) are sent to a remote town and one of them disappears. Director Takashi Miike is renowned for making bizarre, shocking films, and ""Gozu"" certainly doesn't disappoint on that count. This is a very watchable movie, with several unforgettable scenes. Ultimately, however, I was frustrated by it because it seemed to be strange simply for the sake of being strange. I don't need every film to have a tidy resolution, but the art of ambiguity lies in communicating the sense that there is an underlying logic to events, even if we cannot see it right now. I did not feel that such a rationale existed, and the film suffers as a result."
3,"""WHOA"" -NEO STYLE","Just strolling along looking for something different at Hollywood Video and me and my girl came upon this...movie. To sum it up, there are a ton of shock worthy moments. My girl thought it was stupid and slow and fell asleep an hour into it. I kept at it open minded just to see what would happen next. Quite confusing but amusing at most. 2hours I believe is too long for this movie,had it been cut down 30mins I might rate it 3 1/2. For open minded folks how like something different, give it a rent to see some scenes you'd never see in the US."
5,Killer!,This movie is a must see! I thought there were some very cool parts and camera moves done by the director. Its just some strange stuff you need to check out.
3,decent for low budget,"I just like movies that have a little more happening. But with some of the strangest scenes ever, I have to say that I am really split in the middle with this. I didn't like it, but I was almost intrigued enough to watch it again. Everything is just sort of a long build up for the end, and I don't know if it was worth waiting for. I would highly recommend another twisted movie called Oldboy over this."
2,Yakuza Horror Theater,"Simply said, Yakuza Horror Theater isn't for everyone -- particularly in the case of Gozu, which draws heavily from the influences of gangster cinema, art house horror, and the midnight movies of the 70's and 80's. Fans of Cronenberg and Lynch are bound to take an interest; yet, where they succeed in addressing themes such as interchangability and exclusivity, Miike tends to abandon such pursuits in favor of pressing the envelope for shock value in a tradition similar to Jodorowksi. While examples of this range from the humorous (boss being anally impaled by a ladle) to the disturbing (woman giving birth to a full grown man), they unfortunately serve to fracture the film's narrative and distract viewers from gleaning anything significant from the experience. (3/10)"
3,Twisted thoughts..................,"On first viewing this film I thought of Twin Peaks and David Lynch. An odd, slow paced, twisting storyline that keeps you engaged. Out of all of Miike's films this one is my favorite."
5,My dear Norwegian textbook,"I used this book in a beginning Norwegian course at a summer school in Oslo. I found it very helpful - in fact, it may be the only game in town as far as beginning Norwegian textbooks go (not such a huge demand for Norwegian instruction out there). The dialogues seemed a bit silly sometimes in class, but I discovered during my year in Norway that they are very representative of natural Norwegian conversation, and I used phrases from them all the time. In the dialogues and readings, they also hit a lot of fun points of Norwegian culture - travel, matpakker, sausage and potatoes."
2,Bloodless and annoying,"Why were the streets in this book given names each combining two states? Florizona, for instance. Was that supposed to be funny? It was simply annoying, as was this entire book. The characters, with perhaps the exception of Boyd, were bloodless, lifeless. I had no sense that they existed beyong the moments when they appeared in the story. I couldn't wait to finish the book, not because there was any mystery to it, but because I wanted to be finished with it. I never warmed up to Ben or anyone else."
4,Another (smaller) Masterpiece,"As a lifelong fan of David Leavitt, I eagerly anticipated his latest work, and for anyone else who admires Leavitt's pitch-perfect eye for detail and ear for dialogue -- you will not be disappointed.True, the book is an incredibly fast read, and you'll wish he had more to say for the inhabitants of BOYD, but you will recognize that Leavitt's gift for spinning a tale will keep you enraptured from the minute you pick the book up until the breath-taking end.Please give this novel a chance -- the characters within its pages, the time-spanning storytelling and the always enthralling ironic twists in plot will reinforce that David Leavitt is one of our nation's best writers."
2,"characters too thin, plot too rich","I admire Leavitt but agree with the reviewers who say this is not his best work. I have read all of his fiction and especially liked the earliest works--Family Dancing and Lost Language of Cranes. This novel, however, despite the easy flow of the writing, did not stir my interest. The characters weren't fully realized--and I could not conjure feelings for any of them. The plot was quick paced, but to what end? So much time was covered so quickly that I had trouble staying fully engaged. Also, credulity was often stretched to the breaking point--I never before sensed this as a problen in Leavitt's writing. I was ready to jettison at midpoint, mystery or no, but finished nevertheless."
3,"I'm a true Leavitt fan, but this was not his best work.","I've read all of David Leavitt's fiction at least once, and I eagerly await each new book. As a former bookstore manager, I used to love selling his books with a personal recommendation. This was not a book that I could recommend.To my tastes, instead of careful character development, Leavitt leaves the reader with plot twists and turns, spiced up with more than one change in narrative voice in the book's second half. While I am content for favorite authors to try new things - think of Michael Cunningham's The Hours - I found none of what delighted me about Leavitt's earlier fiction in this novel.His sub-par performance is still at least as good as the run-of-the-mill novel, but I was hoping for his usual outstanding delivery."
1,Boring,"Could not even get half-way through this book. Kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. Maybe it does after the halfway point, but I never made it that far."
1,"horrible, but a hot movie","Ok I love Misty films, and all the seduction cinema girls, but this is just horrible."
3,Not bad just not my favorite,"This movie was alright as far as what I expected from Seduction Cinema. It has Julian Wells in it, someone I've never seen before. I thought she was hot and together with Misty Mundae they made a great on screen pair. The story line and acting was not quite as good as some others from seduction cinema I've seen. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, this one just was not my favorite from Seduction Cinema. I'd still have to say that my favorite was the first one I saw, My Vampire Lover."
1,Pseudoscientific ClapTrap,"An important book that belongs in the Museum of Pseudoscience, if such a place exists. Patrick Flanagan is a very successful huckster to the gullible and nothing more. His entire curriculum vitae is made up out of whole cloth. I'm sure he's so successful at tricking the gullible masses out of their money that he believes his own nonsense himself. There is little doubt that he wrote the first review of this book himself."
1,Steer Clear of This Shoddy Transfer!,"VOGUES is one of the very best 1930s musicals, but don't let the price tag of this 'Film Classics' issue fool you into thinking this is the DVD release you've been waiting for. The transfer is absolutely awful, like the kind you find in public domain titles in your local supermarket. It's obviously a glorified bootleg, from the region free coding to the shoddy keep-case artwork to the unprofessional liner notes to the homemade on-screen menu. Somehow, this bathtub-variety issue got past the Amazon screening process, which usually vetoes bootlegs. VOGUES OF 1938 is arguably the very best of the 1930s experiments in early three-strip Technicolor. Presenting it like this is lamentable enough, but the nerve of the price tag doubles the amount of poison swallowed. See VOGUES the way it was meant to be seen -- stick with the pristine print shown on Turner Classic Movies and let this 'digitally remastered' sham pass you by."
2,Watch Band links are very hard to take out!!,"The links on this watch band are very, very tight and difficult to remove, if you need to shorten the watch band. Even with a small vise and hammer, I was unable to pull out any links.Aside from that issue, the watch looks good and works well."
3,"Cheap, But A Good Value","Doesn't have as solid a feel as a similar watch I have from Seiko. However, the Seiko watch needs a repair and a new battery only 2 years in and costs five times as much. That's what sent me back to Timex. The watch works fine, looks fine, and claims a battery life of about 10 years. Resizing the band was a bit of a pain, but it's done now."
4,Good salts for bath and not too fragrant,"I used this product after a long day at school/work and the smell was fantastic and not overwhelming. I also have to say that i was surprised to find that it did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. I would however have to say that for the price, i found the amount of product inadequate, though you do not need alot to enjoy it."
5,WILL THE REAL LORETTA STOKES PLEASE STAND UP !,"Loretta, Your music is real awsome..I really enjoyed listening to the sample music on amazon,that I purchased your CD.I applaude you for the wonderful and gifted voice.keep up the great work.I will be looking forward to your next CD, But who is the person on the cover...ECK!"
5,THIS is D*I*S*C*O*****,"To me, THIS is the ultimate disco/dance album ! The tunes are easy to sing along to and the beat is great thoughout!Especially the 2 CD bonus trax on this re-release, arguably Ms. Pennington's greatest hits, ""Vanity"" and ""All American Boy"" are not to be missed. Get this before it disappears and enjoy being transported back to ""another time and place"" when everything was carefree and the world looked different - at least in your memories!"
4,Excellent for beginers!,I liked the way it's organized. Has most of the information I expected with beautiful illustrations. Will recommend this book for basic stone learning.
2,Does NOT live up to its claims.,I bought it for my Roland AX7 and I couldnt get more then 5-7 feet without drop outs. Maybe if your just transmitting note on note off and velocity commands from 4 feet its good but lets face it...why would you need a wireless for that??? You need a wireless so you can roam around the stage with a keytar. Then you try to take a solo (playing a lot of notes) using pitch bend and Mod wheel and the signal skips out on ya and you look like a fool...(more so then just by playing a keytar..HAHA...but seriously I stopped using it and went back to using a 15 foot midi cable. The batteries were ALWAYS dieing half way thru the gig anyway.
1,for live performances this is junk,"I have a Roland AX-7 ""keytar"" and I was tired of being tied to my midi cable on stage... so I bought this unit to try out. In a noisy environment (RF noise) I could barely get 5feet away from the receiver before it was dropping out... which is pretty much worthless. I returned it the next day.such is the way with wireless units of all kinds... you get what you pay for"
4,Great for what I needed it for,"I purchased this item to drive a vocal processor from my keyboard to the sound board. Published range is about 30 feet and for our kit, that was fine. Worked right out of the box! Good item for the money!"
1,Great disappointment,"I intended to use this to control my main synth using a ""keytar"" on stage when playing live. To my surprise, the connection drops if you go more than 3-5 feet away from the receiver. Waste of money. Shame on you, M-Audio..."
2,The idea was good but this needs to be improved.,"Our 6 month-old loves showers: it is like ""rain"" and she tries to catch it. Unfortunately our bathtub doesn't come with one.This item is a really good idea because it gives you an average temperature of the water and can hold a good amount of it.The problem is that you need to hold the button pretty hard to get the water and then the pressure is really really low... So it is a bit difficult to rinse my daughter.Actually, I stopped using it as a shower and it became a bucket that holds clean water to rinse her after her bath: it is now not a cheap bucket..."
1,Waste,"Don't buy this, just get a detachable shower head hosefor your baby. Like everyone else said, it's a good idea, but you have to hold the tiny little button so hard for water to come out it's a waste of energy..giving a baby a bath shouldn't be this hard. i almost need two hads just to work this thing. Another crappy Summer Infant motorized bath product (Bathtime bubb;e maker is also waste of money-so loud it scares my daughter)"
1,A disappointment,"After looking long and hard for a detachable baby bath shower, this appeared to be the only option available. I noticed all of the disappointed reviews but thought I would give it a try hoping those reviews were only the negative experiences. Well, they are absolutely true. No matter how hard we tried by changing the batteries and reading the directions over and over to see if we missed something we couldn't get the shower to work. This was definitely not worth the time and money to purchase."
1,waste of time and money,I thought this would be a great way to rinse off my baby since we don't have a handheld showerhead in our shower. I put freshly charged batteries in this and absolutely could not get it to work. Then getting the batteries back out was a pain (I had to use pliers).
2,Wish it worked better,"We bought the tub that brings this item and were very excited to use it, at first everything seemes great but the more you use it the more the batteries waste and therefore the flow of water decreases. I think this item is a great idea but it only works well the first day you put new batteries in it. Every day after that, your flow actually slows you down and it becomes quite frustrating. I've stoppped using it because I'm tired of wasting money on the batteries that give you a good flow for only one day and it took me much longer to bathe my baby with this shower than to just use a bucket of water and wash cloths. I was very dissapointed because we bought the tub specifically for this item and both have pretty much been a waste of money."
1,Piece of junk,The battery powered pump slowly dribbles water out with very little pressure. My baby has a lot of hair and after 3 minutes of trying to rinse out the shampoo we have abandoned it in favour of a water jug. At 3am last night I stubbed my toe on it as I went to the bathroom in the dark. I cannot fully describe my anger at this piece of junk.
3,Good but not great,"The seller did an exellent job of getting the CD to me. It arrived shortly after I placed the order.The disappointment was that the disc didn't include the lead song ""Loving You"" by Elvis Presley. I guess the estate wanted too much money for it. The other music on the album was good, but wasn't extneded into full cuts, just the bits and pieces that were in the movie."
3,Slightly flawed,"There's some wonderful stuff here-esp. the material on William Morris and John Ruskin and the neo-Utopian view at the end. I've given the book to several friends, but always with this caveat: don't trust the material on witch burnings. She's bought into what are apparently terribly exaggerated figures on the numbers of victims, which are based on faulty research. Contemporary researchers put the number at 50,000 to 100K rather than the millions cited here. And one was too many, IMO. See WITCH: THE WILD RIDE FROM WICKED TO WICCA by Candace Savage for a more contemporary view."
2,Too overwhelming,"I'm sure that this is a good book - I have seen other things by this author, but this is a huge book that would take an incredible commitment to read. I returned it."
5,great for buffy and angel fans,"I had never seen these episodes, having started watching the show on the episode where Angel left to go to L.A. But when i bought them i was so impressed. Not only is the set really complete, you don't feel lost while watching it even if you never got to watch or read about angel and buffy's relationship this set will help you to understand it."
5,You'll love it.,"If you are someone like me who loves seeing Angel and Buffy together, this movie is sooooooooo for you. A great love story, with tradgedies no other person could imagine. Believe me. I know."
5,Yeah us!,"Well, when I saw the adds for these babies, I almost passed out.... these are some of the best episodes of television to date. Anyone who can listen to ""i only have i eyes for you"" the same way after seeing that episode is crazy. If you like Buffy, or even if you don't, buy these videos, you won't regret it."
3,Better than the Special Value Slayer Pack!,"In the Buffy And Angel Chronicles Gift Set, fans of the T.V. Show Angel will learn more about the character and how he became a vampire with a soul. However, most of the time Angel and Buffy are enemies and you're left still wondering what's the relationship between these two characters that make them bound by a love neither of them can shake. I say wait for the reruns if you're interested in seeing the developing relationship of Angel and Buffy."
5,excellent service,easy to work with the sellers of this book. item was sent out on time. arrived as advertised
1,Awful,"No pictures, which would be fine if he came up with some good recipes. But some of the things he gave were not picniccy at all."
4,Great piece of independent film making!,"Ok - I might be biased since I worked on the film, but I have yet to work on another film where the budget was low and the talent was high!It is too bad that this movie has now almost become a social commentary on the violence we see in schools - while that was not the point of the film it is hard not to see how the kids in middle and high school ""Get caught up in all of the BS"" to quote Dan, the Hall Monitor.I agree with one of the other reviews that it does lag a bit in the middle but it's a great film none the less! One I am happy to have in my collection!"
4,"A fine work, honoring this extraordinary African American","I found this book inspiring and enriching. It's a novel, but I learned a lot from it. It's a suspense story in some ways and a history lesson too. An intriguing, complex book, it follows a vast sweep of American history that this one woman's life covered in reality. Harriet Tubman was no ordinary woman. And you get an up-close and personal glimpse of her spirit and stunning courage and fortitude in these pages. The horrific injustice of slavery as she lived it and saw it leaps off the page. You get a window onto both the remarkable cunning and the deep heart of this visionary American patriot who sacrificed everything to end this shameful episode of our history. Although it's a bit of a struggle to get used to the ""patois"" of her voice (a slave dialect) and there are also a lot of people and places to keep track of as you read, keeping you on your toes, it's well worth it. Check it out."
4,action packed and defining of spectactular,Saw enogh action to say that this product is well worth getting to have in a collection. I you get one dvd I recomend that this is one that you get now.
5,Exclusive Bonus Disc!!!,"I just discovered that Blockbuster is selling an exclusive version of Royal Rumble 2007 which includes a bonus disc. On the bonus disc you'll find: John Cena Vs. Umaga contract signing, Shawn Michaels Vs. Edge(Street Fight from Raw), Undertaker Vs. Mr. Kennedy(from Smackdown)and an ECW World Title Triple Threat Match-Bobby Lashley Vs. Rob Van Dam Vs. Test(from the January 16th ECW On Sci Fi). Also, for some reason not all Blockbusters have received their copies of the Rumble so I'd suggest calling around because I've only been able to find one location that received the DVD. For more breaking news on everything wrestling related please call the Ringside Report Hotline at (847)604-3769. It's a free call. Thank you for reading my comments."

4,Are you ready to rumble?!,"This DVD is pretty cool and has some good matches on it, but the main reason I bought it is the fact that the Undertaker won this Rumble and he is the Phenom. Other than that, it's pretty much what you would expect from a DVD on the Royal Rumble."

5,Very good book for kids... a classic..,My 4 year old loves this book so as soon as I purchased my Fire HD I downloaded it straight away! Great stuff!
5,Poignant look at a tragic time in American History,"Ms Erlich has written an excellent perspective of the tragic relocation of the Nisei Japanese during WWII. She carefully and artistically describes the impact on these loyal Americans and the their impact on the community in Wyoming of which they were forced to become a part. She describes the feelings of the Rocky Mountain West rural community forced to recieve these ""foreigners"" and how they accepted and/or rejected these people moved simply because of their ethnicity and how the relationship between a young rancher and a japanese-american women grows and changes both people. An excellent read"
2,Not very good,"They squeak and make weird noises when you use them. They were too tight, and there was no size on the website so I guessed they were like average Trojans, but they were too tight. Uncomfortable. Wouldn't buy these."
5,Good product,I have to say that this product brings me a very fatastic feeling when I use it. My wife also very happy with.
3,From the good side of modern poetry....,"This work won the NATIONAL BOOK AWARD for POETRY.I have read a lot ..... did I say a lot? I meant enormous amounts of..... poetry. Classical, modern, cultural and everything in between. I am not fond of many contemporary poets because of the urge in them to write as obscure as possible.This work, however, is good. It certainly is not Lord Byron, and no one will mistake Mueller for Yeats, yet, there is not a lot of wonderful poetry being published at present (though a lot is being published).For a lark I bought this book, along with a bunch of others, and was pleasantly surprised to see some decent poetry. ""NIGHT SONG"" is my favorite, but is somewhat contrived. I also like ""SOMETIMES, WHEN THE LIGHT."""
3,Not much substance,I expected the book to contain more info on successful pharm sales tecniques (duh - from the title). I found it basically to be a million dollar title with very little beneficial information. You would be better off getting a classic book on general sales tecniques.
1,stay away,"This book was a big dissapointment. It had very little information that even someone far removed from the industry would not know. We all know it is difficult to see some physicians, how about some advice about how to do it. If this guy was an expert in the field, he is keeping the information for himself. I read this simple book in an hour."
2,Not very helpful and sometimes confusing...,"As a recent college graduate trying to land a job in the field I did not find this book very helpful. Not only did the book include some very confusing diagrams, it did not include the information that I was looking for such as what it takes to land a job in the feild, or how we can better ourselves for the job. I probably would have found a book on interviewing or selling more helpful, however, I did obtain some basic knowledge about the profession from this book."
4,very readable-good basic info-excellent starting point,"This book was a great starting point on selling pharmeceuticals. The book was clear, concise, and easily read. I read the book in one evening. The author gives good info on the major customers-doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and hmo's. I only wish this book went into more details on subject including resumes, job interviews, etc...worth reading, but if your interested in topic meet with a sales rep-the info you will get will be 10 times what this book can provide."
1,Don't waste your time.,This book will teach you nothing other than that the author likes to self promote himself. The content is so basic that you would learn more from children selling lemonade and it would at least be cheaper and you would leave with a refreshing drink. I feel fortunate that I only borrowed it and did not purchase it.
1,Not an ejoyable story,There is nobody in this story that is likeable & the story does not have a very good or beleiveable plot.
3,An okay money clip,"The clip itself works just fine and can hold your cash well. However, what I specifically didn't like about this product was that it couldn't handle more than 2 cards in the card part. I actually need space for maybe 4 or 5 cards, so perhaps a clip isn't for me -- I'm still looking for the ideal one.If all you need is something to carry a license and some cash, this is a good product. If you're like me and need a credit card, health insurance card, and one or two others, you may want to choose something else."
5,Calico Palace,"This is a wonderful book,h I read if first back in the 70's I believe in high school & just loved it & have read it over & over. I am going to have my granddaughters read it as well."
5,Oldy but goody.,"I loved this book when I first read it in the 1960s and I loved it when I read it again recently. The author captured the characters, the flavor of the developing California, and the excitement and tragedy of the early days of the gold rush as well as the difficulties of staying civilized in a less than civilized environment."
4,A great ( and special) book !!!,"My mom was reading this book when she found out she was having twins ( 1976) and named me ""Kendra"" because she loved the name. She saved the book for me to read when I got older and I've read it a million times. It's so sweet and such a perfect story. I know it's out of print but if you ever come across it in a used bookstore - PICK IT UP !!!!"
5,tholds your attention from page one.wonderful historical rom,"over the tears I have read this book 10 times. In one of my moves, i lost it, and have been looking for it again.It held my attention evey time I read it, and want to do so again. I know i wouldn't have what it took to go through what these women did. It's an absolutely wonderful book. and I can't wait to get it back in my library!"
5,best game ever,"Hei this card game is the best ever, i was one of the kids that playd yugioh, but a friend of mine asked me to trye it, and it was super and no one can saye no too the rush this game has too offer. And it totaly kicks yugioh`s but buy this game and enjoy it fore a long time."
5,Good manual,I bought the manual for a 94 40hp. It shows all the needed specs for general maintence and work. Alot of flipping from section to section but a good manual.
3,"Really bad video transfer, great movie",Terrific movie but the video transfer on this one is terrible. Most of the images are washed out. This is the one by Alpha Video.
3,The quality of some,"The quality of some video clips aren't to great. some of them are. and some video's are live, But ""One Blood (It's Okay)ft. Junior Reid"" ""Wouldn't Get Far ft. Kanye West"" ""The Remmedy"" and ""Hate It Or Love It ft. 50Cent"" are atleast good quality."
5,exquisite jewelry,"The earring jackets were just as I expected, brilliant stones and styling as in the picture. My studs look beautiful encased in these jackets. The seller is great and my jewelry arrived two days after I ordered them. Great product and reputable seller."
5,Truly Scottish Feast!,"This book is first rate if you're interested in truly Scottish recipes. It also includes some interesting background about food in Scotland. The recipes are easy to follow. There is an page of definitions of Scottish terms and a metric conversion chart for us Yanks. There are also plenty of pictures, not only of the food, but also of interesting people and places.The book is out of print now. I checked it out from my local library to get ideas for a Scottish wedding feast. I like it so well, that I hope I can find one for my own."
2,too much work to give you feedback,You require too much work and time to give you feedback.Just leave the rating at number of stars selected.
1,"Jimmy ""Bo"" Horne","This disc is labeled as ""Essential Cuban Music."" The playlist suggested that I was getting Originals + Re-Mixes. Wrong! The whole disc is one big remix. And, not that good at that! The reason why I even ordered this was to get remastered tunes. So disappointing. It looks like I'll just have to wait until something better comes along. But, until then, this goes back!Don't buy this one - you've been warned!!I rate the disc: 1 star (I really like Jimmy ""BO"" Horne - but this - sucks!!)"
5,Comprehensive,"Dermatology Clinics is a journal that showcases a broad topic and then reviews it from all angles. With a common guest editor at the helm, different articles on the dermatological problem, are written by different authors. The beauty of this is that the reader who gets to read the journal can do so readily expecting high quality articles with up to date information. With a hardcover format, the journal belongs on the shelves of every dermatologist. Truly a great publication!"
1,Another movie that I should've left in Wal-Mart,"Although Gary Dourdan looked fantabulous in this movie, I thought it was one of the worst movies ever done by Roy Campanella II. First of all, the love scenes came too quickly, it didn't even make sense. Second of all, how dumb could that girl get. First she didn't know who those people were chasing her than she knew who the people were. It was like Lady, make up your mind. This was just as bad as that movie ""Ritual"". This is a waste. Do not buy it please"
2,Bad scriipt,"Watched this movie and the script and the acting was bad. Fortunately I didn't read the book which judging by the other reviews was a good thing because I would have been disappointed.Athough Gary Dourdan is a reasonable actor, in this he was terrible."
5,Made my girlfriend happy (no more hymen!),"Bought this kit for my girlfriend, who still had her hymen (at age 22!) and wanted it gone. She was afraid of the pain of intercourse, so we opted for the ""gradual removal"" method. This kit proved to do the trick. She's as happy as a clam! (And I'm making plans for a special weekend, finally!)"
2,too rigid,did not like! kind of painful because the material has no give to it. would not recommend this product to increase vaginal size.
2,Disappointing,"I have to respectfully disagree with the other two reviewers. I have been a fan of Tinsley's since the days of the Heartfixers and this disc has almost NONE of his distinctive guitar on it. David Z has made significant contributions to CDs by other guitarists (Kenny Wayne Shepherd) but this is just a bad fit. The material is very weak and if it wasn't his first (and only) disc on this label I would think he just put it out to fulfill a contractual obligation.Any one of his Alligator CDs along with the records he did with the Heartfixers are better than this, and his last disc on Telarc, Hell or High Water, was his best CD in years and restores him to his rightful place as one of the premier white blues players alive today."
3,Be aware of certain relationships...,"Just try to doubt to every author related to epistemology that dislike to talk in dialectical terms about science and ideology.
