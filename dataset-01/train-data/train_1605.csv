5,This book is absolutely wonderful...,When I read the first page of this book I couldn't put it down for a second! This book never nas a dull moment!
2,What?,"I don't understand how any of you can rate this book so high. I'll admit it kept my attention and was very interesting, but it was so sad! I love dogs and the ""love"" in this book was awful! I hate to say it, but I can't wait for a sequel!"
4,One great book,Okay so my wife read this book and she's said this is a great book darling you should read it and i said no if you read it and liked it then i probably wont like it and she said well at least read the first page and i was like okay and twenty minutes later I was finished with the first chapter and i didn't want to stop reading it! and this is amazing because last time i read a book and it kept my attention for more than 5 min i was in 1st grade reading the cat in tha hat! This book is very interesting and it is great 4 men and i guess women since my wife liked it too.
3,"Cheap price, cheap workmanship","I purchased the Ultra Cruiser, and I guess you get what you pay for. The wheels are made from cheap plastic and rubber. The frame seems to be solid, though. Hoever, After the first 18 holes of use, the wheels started becoming wobbley, and not rolling smoothly. I would have hoped for more from this product. I tried to contact Golf Gifts & Gallery, to see about ordering replacement wheels, in case these break. They referred me back to Amazon, and stated that they (Amazon)are responsible for the product now (Poor customer service). I would not recommend the purchase of this product."
3,"Good guard and flange set, but missing Wheel Wrench","GOOD NEWS: The guard fits my Dewalt D28474 Type 3 8000RPM Angle Grinder snuggly and securely. My 7"" diamond cutting wheel turns easily inside the guard secured by the D284932 flange set that was included.BAD NEWS: However, the Wheel Wrench that was promised as part of this kit was NOT INCLUDED."
3,Heat pack,Ordered this as a neck/ shoulder pack but once rec'd I knew I had made a mistake! Do not want to use anything water related....too messy and takes too long to prepare. Give me something I can pop in the microwave for 2 minutes and be done! My own fault for not reading closely.
4,everything I expected,this arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered. I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to others. I have used this product many times and my clients love it! It works well with my chattanooga Hydrocollator that I currently have.
5,Keith Urban Fantastic,"An absolute must for anyone who has chronic pain and can't get to your message therapist at 3:00 am when your in pain and suffering, This is a great easy product the same you would find at a medical clinic that you can use at home, less the price of professional treatments. Great to be found on line for pain sufferers that can really benefit."
4,"Beautiful, Roomy, but ""Uncomfortable""","I fell in love with this bag when I saw it online. I bought it right away - got a fantastic deal! When it arrived, I was happy to see that it was even prettier in real life! Nice soft leather, surprisingly roomy for a bag that looks as small as this one. However, all of that being said, I ended up returning the bag. The strap wasn't very comfortable at all, and it was awkward, constantly falling off of my shoulder. If you're more of a elbow-draping bag type, this bag would be perfect for you, but otherwise, it's not all that practical. But Oh, so pretty!!"
3,"Great product, bad price",I've been using the sea salt grinder for about 2 years now and love it. I received this in one of my Gold Box offers and was ready to buy for $25.49. Don't buy these here- go to oxo.com- only $15.00. Their shipping is $4.95+ but still cheaper than Amazon's price.
4,"Love the ""Amazing Grace"" song","I bought this CD especially for the song ""Amazing Grace"" sung by Aaron Neville..I had never heard this rendition before, but it really touches my heart when I hear it."
5,This is the way reissues should be done!,"MCA Japan has really outdone itself with this elaborate, sparkling reissue. The remastered tracks bring new life to this psychedelic classic, Cass's first artistic opus. ""California Earthquake,"" ""Long Time Loving You,"" ""Burn Your Hatred,"" and ""Dream a Little Dream"" burst out with a sound quality that puts most American re-issues to shame. This album has been out of the public's consciousness for well past thirty years. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. ""Sweet Believer,"" a sprawled-out ballad of epic proportions replete with enigmatic lyrics and Stax-y horns, is worth the price alone."
5,Cass's Best,"""Dream a Little Dream of Me,"" released in 1968, came to me as a gift in 1967--a promotional ""not for distribution"" vinyl. Cass Elliot's debut solo album, it established her as one of the great ""voices"" of the 1960's. An eclectic mix of some traditional and some quite unusual songs, it showcases her talent in several genres from playful (""Rubber Band"") to country catsup (""Jane the Insane Dog Lady"" and ""Talkin' to Your Toothbrush"") to dreamy torchsong (""Sweet Believer""). I had never heard most of the songs before, and I have never heard them sung by other artists since, which is fine because Cass's performance would be tough to follow. I feel the two best numbers on the album are ""What Was I Thinking Of,"" which reveals her powerful voice and great range, and ""Sweet Believer."" But for me, every song on this album is great. It remains one of the finest presents I have ever received."
5,I am so lucky,I was so happy to see this album on CD. I remember having it on 8-Track tape when I was a teenager. Have been searching for it for a few decades. Mama Cass is the best! The CD was shipped extremely fast. Only hang up was US Customs. Otherwise no complaints
2,"The photo represents the LP cover, but only cassette is avaiable","My memory of the LP cover for Mama Cass's first solo album corresponds to that which Amazon.com has on their web-site; however, the LP is not actually available, apprently anywhere. The picture of Mama Cass and her daughter as shown on Amazon.com misrepresents the item that you can purchase. Specifically, only the cassette by the same name (""Dream A Little Dream"") is for sale via Amazon.com, and it does not contain the lovely ""Sweet Believer"" track. Only the LP offers that track. Very sad and frustrating to have purchased two cassettes and found no ""Sweet Believer"" track. Perhaps a picture is worth a thousand words, but this picture (see above) suggests deceptive advertising."
4,yay,The English acting in the game is annoying and pretty bad but if you just pay attention to the overall story you get over it
2,Not as good as the original,I was hoping for something like the first game but the changes are not an improvement they should have kept the same model and just created more content for it I couldn't recommend this a huge disillusionment.
4,Legaia 2,"First of all the battles are beautiful and fun, but after the tenth battle they just get long and boring.Plus this game is WAY TOO EASY!!!"
5,COOL!!,"Personally, I don't have this yet (it's in my wish list) andhave never played it but have seen a complete guide and based onRPG experience, the other reviews and news from friends, I'd sayit is worthy of the name LEGAIA.To whoever wrote the JUST A GAME TO PASS TIME review, I dontmean to insult you but YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT RPG AND ARE WRONG!( Legend [ of ] ) Legaia 2: Duel Saga is a GGGRRREEEAATT GAME"
5,"Very interesting reading, & excellent source of rare info.","This book gives a complete and thorough account of nearly all of Lucy's television appearances, including all of her series (even the oft-forgotten 'Life With Lucy'!) as well as specials, talk shows, and variety show appearances. Interviews with people who knew and worked with her make for a fascinating look at this woman and her work. I very highly recommend it for anyone who loves Lucy, who loves trivia, or who loves to read."
3,Encyclopedic but tangential at times,"This encyclopedic chronology of Miss Ball's TV appearances will interest history and trivia buffs. Of special interest are some unexpected, first-hand commentaries by Hollywood's leading actors and producers of years gone by.One unfortunate annoyance: The book's inclusion of numerous unrelated TV appearances by Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr., who approved the book for publication. The book even acknowledges that these appearances have nothing to do with Ball, even as it lavishes over-the-top and uncritical praise for the Arnazes. Sure, they both seem like attractive and friendly people, but to repeatedly call Lucie Arnaz an acting ""tour de force"" is a bit much."
3,Exhaustive Reference,"Detailed analyses of every episode of Lucille Ball's four sitcoms, plus an examination of every television appearance she ever made from 1947 through her death. Snippets of interviews give a fascinating glimpse into a lost era of television.My only complaint is that author displays a creepy and disgustingly sexual interest in Miss Ball. She is lucious, voluptuous, gorgeous, stunning, beautiful, feminine, entrancing, enticing, etc., etc., etc. ad nauseam. Surely most of us think of ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Lucy Show"" as comedies, not pornography, and we have no interest in being told the details of the author's obsession."
4,Throwback to an earlier time - enjoying the books,"I was looking for a ""series"" for my 8-year old son that wasn't just nonsense or fighting. These books tell the story of orphans who eventually go to live with their grandfather. The first book in the series for example, shows the closeness of the children, their love for each other, consideration, responsibility in the case of the oldest, resilience. In this, these books are a throwback, when more children's books had a moral or more than just action. Although it is not a series my son would have picked for himself (preferring SpongeBob, Captain Underpants or anything Star Wars), he enjoys the story while he is reading it and I hope something is rubbing off on him. An entertaining series!"
5,The Boxcar Children book set,Totally Pleased! Ordered it for my grandson and had it shipped directly to him. He has really enjoyed them.Thanks.
5,Avid reader and I loved this series as a child.,"I have always been an avid reader and I was thrilled to find this series for sale on Amazon. I read them when I was about 10 years old and I was engrossed. The first book is the best. I bought these for my granddaughter so that she can enjoy them as much as I did and get a sense of my childhood ""world"".She hasn't read them yet, they're a christmas gift. I hope they increase her love of books so that she grows up in a world that opens new adventures every time she cracks a spine.They are good, clean reading and I would recommend them to any child (boys or girls) around 8 - 12 years old."
5,DESIREE REVIEW OF THE BOX CAR CHILDREN,"Wow the Boxcarchildren was a great book.Ijust got done reading it,it was wonderful.Theboxcarchildren is about four children that are runaways.They have a grandpa that they think is going to be mean to them.They are cool children.because they make beds to sleep in and are trying to find a place to live.Henry the oldest child is trying to find a job to earn some money.The grandpa might be mean or not you figure that out yourself.I recommend you read this book because the kids are creative and this book is engaging."
5,So simple and so wonderful!,"These books are wonderful. My son who loves sci-fi, dragons and lego, thinks these wonderful books are AWESOME! They capture his attention like no others. As I read these to aloud to him, he laughs, asks questions and wishes he could be there. Although the writing is very simple, the ideas behind them are not. When I first started reading this series to him he said to me,""Mom while you are reading I always feel like I am there with the children doing what they are doing."" ""YEAH!"" Great stories about children who are THINKING and I love my son to want to emulate that!"
5,I remember.......,"I am a 57 year old grandmother to twin girls. As I was exploring books to get for them, I remembered the whole series of Boxcar Children books when I was in elementary school. In fact, I was so young, the teacher read them aloud in the room! I remember that sweet teacher reading a few chapters everyday....and the class begging for more!! What great books and memories!!!"
2,I never liked these books,"OK, I have to be honest, I didn't like this series when I was a kid. I was a voracious reader and I read the entire Boxcar series because it was recommended, maybe because I LOVED the Narnia books, and the Boxcar series also stars four siblings.The characters are flat, prissy and dorky, and their dialogue always struck me as very unrealistic.These books don't hold a candle to the Narnia books, and it's unfair to compare them. But I would venture that the Boxcar books are just not even worth reading."
2,Kelsie's Review,I'm going to tell you about a book called ''The Boxcar Children''. There once was 4 children who ran away from home.They needed a place to sleep and they found a bakery . They met some people who they thought were nice then they had to run away again. They found a place to stay and met a nice doctor. I thought it was just .o.k. because it was kind of hard to follow. I felt there was too much going on to keep track of. I give this book 2 stars.
5,THE BOXCAR CHILDREN MYSTERIES (BOOKS 1-4),"My seven year old second grade granddaughter read the first book and started on the second on the first day I gave the set to her. And she relayed, in detail, what the story was about. Also, her 47 year old mother couldn't put them down once she started reading them.My friend, who is in her 70's said that Boxcar Children were her favorite books when she was a child and she purchased the whole series for her granddaughter, who is an elementary teacher, to use in her classroom."
4,The box car children,"I like the book ""the box car children""b/c it's the only book that I can read and get into,and I've read I think almost all of there books, there awesome. Plus it's really cool how reall people lived in a box car.THAT'S COOL.It's how they snuk into there grandparent's store that's got nothing but guard's all over the place b/c there grandparent's are so rich and populare to the town. If you ask me they are some CRAZY kids for trying to go around the realy good guard's that's cool.Climax=I think the climax of the book is when the guard's was about 10 feet away from them and almost seen the little kid. Conflict=The conflict in the story is there trying to find the missing dinosaure from there grandparent's store that is realy populare."
4,Why I like this book.,"I like this book because the Aldens are very greatful for things that we think are trash, even a dumbster with things nobody cares about.I like all the Aldens in a very specail way. I like Henrey because he is a great example for all the Aldens. I like Jessie because she's always helpful. I like Violet because she is always willing to make new friends. And last but not least Benny. I like Benny because he is always trying to find a mystery"
5,Attention Amazon,"When you don't include sound clips, I will not buy the album, understood? Include sound clips on all albums!"
3,Adequate but mediocre,Not bad but not great. Useful to familiarize with the tunes esp. if this group is new to you but no real drive or excitement where they could use it. Synchronicity II pales in comparison to the studio recording. Most of the other tracks are just plain dull. They don't cut loose and let the music rock - I guess the concerts weren't that thrilling either. Makes the cover photo somewhat misleading. My real rating is 2 and 1/2 stars.
1,Avoid this cd,"Totally did not like it, y ??? most of the songs though played live did not sound like the original songs, very disappointed."
2,MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER,"I am not a Police fan, I do like Sting's solo material, but this cd, has not made me any more of a Police fan, than before. This two cd set , comes from. two differnt times in the Police's career. Disk one from early, when they were more of a Punk rock band, and disk two, when they were superstars.Disk one is boring, the numbers are dragged out, and unless your a big Police fan, you may not know alot of the songs. Disk one I give a 1/2 star. Disk two, the songs are tighter, sound better, and at times they almost seem to be having fun. One draw back to this set,is that 4 songs found on disk two, are on disk one. Making this really a waste. Disk two 3 1/2 stars. Overall 2 stars."
3,1 out of 2 ain't so good,I bought this album after hearing the Police on Live Earth. I didn't like the first CD. The band sound like they are rushing through the concert and would rather be somewhere else. I liked the second CD.
2,Bad product - didn't work even for a single try,"I was using the presenter for the first time, and about 10 minutes into my presentation, the laser button got jammed and stopped working. Subsequently, the page-up and page-down buttons felt like they could come off any second. While it worked right out-of-the-box on my macbook (with MS powerpoint), the presenter seems really flimsy and even for $12 (I bought it on a sale), it doesn't seem worth it. I am trying to return it and hoping that I'll get my money back."
1,Great while it lasted - and that wasn't very long...,"Bought this product in summer of 2008. I teach classes only 4-6 weeks per year plus other miscellaneous uses. After only a couple of months, the slides would just fly by during a presentation (only when this device was plugged in). By May 2009, the advance button was stuck and the product was useless. I could not get the product to work again.***STAY AWAY - VERY POOR QUALITY!!!"
5,Just plug it in!,"Soooooooooo easy! All I did was insert the flash drive, install the enclosed battery and voila! Good range too! The laser pointer is also very handy. It's so compact --the size of a ballpoint pen. Clipped it to my shirt and I'm ready to go!! I've used others that were a lot bulkier and slower. Forward and back buttons work flawlessly. The small case is also a plus! Whoever designed this has actually used one because they have thought of everything. Highly recommend!"
3,Great for the price,"This is a very inexpensive too, the quality is not great but for sporadic use is perfect. Is a little cumbersome to open and replace the batteries but I can live with that."
1,Laser pointer device,The battery must be replaced every day. Would not have purchased if I had known this. Laser is week and lasts about 1 hour tops! Do not recommend!
2,Could have been a nice product if all the features would work,"I think I got the RF Wireless Laser Pointer Presentation Device around November of 2010 for my sister as a Christmas gift. It is somewhat sad to say that not all the features work as they were supposed to. It turned out to be difficult to access the battery compartment. The remote presentation feature works just fine with the powerpoint presentations in her laptop so far, BUT the laser pointer doesn't work at all, even after changing the battery. Very dissapointing!"
3,Nice design but with a catch,"I am teaching a class this summer using PowerPoint for the first time. Wanting to give a remote a try, I purchased this one as the price was good and it had just the features I would need. While I like the design and the carrying case, there have been several times that the advance key has stuck and the slides run by very fast and then I have to back track to where I was. This never happened when I used the laptop's Page Down key for my presentations and has now happened about six times in the past four weeks, so I wouldn't call it a fluke. So now I've ordered a different remote and will hopefully no longer have this problem."
3,Dead Battery,"I used this product for one 20 min presentation and when I went to use it the second time, the battery was dead already. I went to replace the battery and it turns out it takes a special 23A 12V battery. I would take this into consideration when purchasing! When the battery is not dead, the pointer is great! It has easy connectivity with my computer, just plug and play, and has great range. The laser pointer button and up and down buttons are easy to use and logical while making a presentation. (I did not have any troubles with pushing the wrong buttons!)"
1,"Great functionality, crappy battery life!","Pros: This pointer is streamlined and easy for any ""pointy haired boss"" to use! Priced under $15 it's a bargain.Cons: Terrible batterly life! The second presentation we used this for the batter started to fail. That's less than 2 hours of actual use for ppt page flipping and occasional laser pointer. It's also got a small 13V battery, so when the pointer craps out you can't just go the easy route with AAA battery."
2,good pointer but presentation function doesn't work,Cannot be used to control PowerPoint presentation as the seller claimed. Tried with Windows XP and Vista. Tried on multiple laptops. The product box had no contact company address nor phone number (as if this product were made in a basement somewhere in China). I don't recommend buying this product.
2,"Fun, but don't use if your presentation is important.","I loved the price, the look, the feel, etc.But, I was presenting to a 3-hour workshop that would be video-taped and then shown on the web. For a couple of days before the presentation, I practiced (my slides had several animation components -- bullets would appear then disappear, etc.) Nearly every time that I practiced, at some point during the presentation, the slides would zoom through about 25 clicks and then I would need to back-track. Also, I would need to press the advance button several times sometime to get it to work. Maybe I need more practice, but it was just something I couldn't take a chance on for the web presentation. I'll use it in low-risk situations, like class... but not for anything terribly important (that's not to say that class is not important -- but giving my own students a chance to laugh at my ineptness with technology can actually be beneficial)."
2,nice idea,"This unit is a nice size and works well. However, it lasted less than six months and needed to be replaced. The issue was that one of the buttons got stuck in the depressed position and could not be dislodged."
1,not workable,Who can tell me how to open it and insert the battery?I don't think there is a way for doing so. But I hope I am wrong
1,Broke after 2nd use,The seam of this mug separated after the second use - rendering it useless. Not worth buying one of these sight unseen.
5,Too Good,The film is a narration by a adolescent who is in love and has competition. Very well done and ofcourse the film also depicts life in Bengal/India and other cultural issues in a very subtle way. Just marvelous. Very well presented.
4,A Bit Disappointed,The movie itself is wonderful but I have to say I am a bit disappointed in the transfer and cleaning of the film for DVD.In several shots the colour varies from frame to frame and as the background moved from a muted blue to brown and back again I found it disquieting. Although colour was touted as another character in the film I found it overall dull.My expectations of Criterion may be too high and perhaps digital enhancement of the colour was beyond its capability or its intent. I just imagine the original film in Technicolor popping off the screen and was disappointed that the DVD didn't as well.
4,french indian film classic,Jean Renoir's first film in color -a moving and gentle meditation on the pain of growing up and the difficulties of the English in India half a century ago in understanding the strange world and culture they lived in. Beautiful filming and very effective playing by many young cast members. A real joy.
3,Echt Karajan has its drawbacks,"If you like your Ravel technically & mechanically perfect you cannot go wrong with Karajan. But if you like your Ravel truly sensual, nuanced and flexible, skip this. The competition achieves more of the sensual French psique plus the decadent neurosis of one of my favorites pieces 'La Valse' (1919). If I don't mention another conductor is because there are too many good ones to even remember.Contrary to what is stated somewhere else, as if La Valse (1919) was a mere corolary to the composer's mother passing, I find it much more compelling to think that it represents the collapse of the Austrian empire (where Strauss waltzes were pervasive!) and the apparent breakdown of Europe after the Great War (WWI).The recording is spacious but clear and tonally broad. Some may find the acoustics too reverberant, I did not."
2,Lackluster Ravel,"Karajan was a decent Ravel conductor. I find his Ravel in later years on the Deutsche Grammophon to be much better than this recording. There are several problems with this recording besides the obvious: the audio quality. ""Le Tombeau de Couperin"" sounds like a jumbled up mess. ""La Valse"" sounds like it was recorded from outer space.Audio quality aside, the performances and interpretations are incredibly lackluster. The last movement of ""Le Tombeau de Couperin"" is taken way too slow, which I think causes it to loose it's appeal. This piece is actually supposed to be performed at a moderately fast tempo.I like Karajan, but I think with all the Ravel recordings available, that the potential buyer should look elsewhere. Try Dutoit, Tortelier, Boulez, and Martinon for superlative performances."
3,FOOL!,"this series starts off incredibly awesome! however i'm one of those types where an ending can kill it all for ya! how the end villain was delt with was complete and utter B.S. go ahead and buy this series, just don't watch the last two episodes.... and forget about how you become a deathcyth, it gets forgotten in the series anyway."
5,Excellent Single with Great Bonus Tracks,"It's hard to believe that it's been more than 7 years since the Verve hit a (commercial) nerve with the beautiful and haunting single ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" of the ""Urban Hymns"" album, but as the years roll by, their biggest hit stands the test of time.The US release of the ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" single (4 tracks, 21 min.) includes 3 addititional non-album tracks that makes this a perfect combo. ""Lord I'll Guess I'll Never Know"" is a pensive song. ""So Sister"" is lead singer Richard Ashcroft's at his achingly best, just a beautiful ballad. But the closer ""Echo Bass"" is the best of the bonus tracks, an up-tempo song reminiscent of the Stone Roses' ""Fool's Gold"".After the ""Urban Hymns"" album, Richard Ashcroft went solo, and he never reached the high of that album. This single presents the best of the Verve, and of Richard Ashcroft. Highly recommended!"
2,Did not fix my 2002 Nokia phone,"I bought this battery to replace an old battery on a Nokia 6010. The phone indicates it is charged, but as soon as I make a call it goes dead all of a sudden. I had to change the phone because I could not make or receive calls from anybody. Battery not working properly."
3,Interesting premise.,This book was a tale within a story within prison walls. A very creative approach to fiction!
4,looks better then Bugs bunny crazy castle 4,"This game looks better then the last bugs bunny one. The faries have asked for Woody woodpeckers help. There is a multi-player mode, easy key collect, and 6 worlds with 6 stages each. This is going to be for all ages.The hearts get smaller and smaller everytime you get hurt.There is a different way to get into doors <makes the game more harder to solve.> There is a slot macine. You should try this game it looks really fun."
1,definitly will not get woody from this,This game stinx like woodpecker poop ... not fun at all ... more tedious if anything .. ahhhh im fustrated!!!
1,Defective Costume,"We were so excited to get this costume for my son's 4th grade Living Museum Project. Sadly, the costume was defective, and was unusable. Most of the stitching simply came apart when my son tried on the costume. At this point, we are still waiting for a response about how to return or get a refund."
2,pants are poor,The product did what was needed but the pants completely fell apart. The jacket was fine. Be ready to have some sort of alternative for the pants.
5,Pokemon for pre-readers,"My son just turned five and can not read, but he loves Pokemon. This book is a Where is Waldo type book and can be used by non-readers. On each page you have to find Pokemon while going through a maze. This book is more of a game then a reading book. I highly recommend this book for pre-reader Pokemon lovers to get them interested in looking at books on their own."
3,Good for the younger ones.,"My son just turned seven and found the Pokemon very easy to find. However, having said that he thoroughly enjoyed doing it."
5,Top 20 Count Down,"This video is great. My son, who is 2 and 1/2, loves it. It's very easy for him to follow through and learn to sing the songs. I recommend it."
5,Excellent Book Once You Get Into It,"I agree with Omni. When I first started reading I was determined to make it thought although the beginning seemed poorly written and confusing. By the time I got to book III, it was difficult to put the compendium down. The authors did an excellent job of referencing canon works in small ways here and there and they also do a very good job of making sure that the conversation is typical of the characters (for the most part). Aside from the occasional religious tirade by a random cast member and portraying the Captain as a slightly apprehensive leader (as opposed to his all-out persona in the show), it was one of the better Star Trek books I have read."
5,Robb Brings Medieval Times to Life,"In the spring of 1366, Dame Joanna Calverley appears in Beverley England after an absence of several months -- and after having been reported dead and buried. Though Dame Joanna claims to have been resurrected in order to return a relic she had stolen from St. Clement's nunnery, no one knows the truth of her story. Did she ever really die? And why did she run away from St. Clement's in the first place? Soldier-sleuth Owen Archer is sent to unravel the mystery, and he and his wife, Lucie, are dragged into the case until they are in danger of losing their lives. Candace Robb's mystery is a well-written story and an easy read. Characters, setting, and plot are all well-developed, drawing the reader into Owen and Lucie's adventures."
3,so-so,fan was ok. thought it was overpriced. seemed to be nothing special. was simple to install and seems to be working fine. just a fan...
1,Avoid Avoid Avoid,"This book gets one star because that's the least you can give.I have never read a worse book in my life. Let me rephrase that: I have never partially read a worse book in my life. Anybody who actually finishes this book is illiterate, paid to read it or astonishingly brave."
2,Waste of time and OVER-promsied,"I've been a Peters fan for more than a decade, but find this to be one of his worts, most recylced efforts yet.Trends?! - I'm more than 1/2 way through the book and the authors are still working to convince you that women are THE (of two, including seniors) important market segment of our future. Ok, I'm conviced! ...I was at page 5, maybe as late as page 10-15. They really didn't need to spend 80 pages doing it before they actually start writing about the trend, and how to 'recognize, analyze and capitalize'Don't buy it. Skimming the book at Barnes&Noble; is all you need."
1,Waste of time and $$,"I bought the book because I thought it would be about 'Trends' and might give guidance into products and services that could be marketed. After 10 pages I realized it was nothing of the sort. It seems to be a soap box designed to show the superiority of females in all things. I am not a chauvenist by any means, but I was offended by Martha Barletta's portrayal of men. And often her take on men vs women was just not accurate. That men care what people think of them more than women? Come on now..all her information is anecdotal - no statistics. Just ranting and denigrating men. WASTE of $$$. This booklet wouldn't have sold 100 copies if Tom Peters' - who happens to be a man -name wasn't on it."
1,Trends (Tom Peters Essentials),"We have not received our Trends book which we ordered on the 19th November 2006. We expected it between 7th and 19th December but because it was around Christmas we thought the mail may be running late and left it to the new year. Now we are back from Holiday's, we have still not received the book.Could you please look into this and get back to me ASAP.Thank you!I have tried to contact you, looking on your website site for an email address and could not find one, I have tried to reply to your emails that Amazon have sent me but they dont' alow me too. Could someone please look into this ASAP."
3,Nice Brain Candy,"For those days when you want something nice and light, and not too challenging then this book is the ticket. The main character, Bernie, is very likable, witty and yes, charming. Other characters abound that are interesting, but weakness lies with the bad guys, who seem to pop out of nowhere at the end of the book in order to straighten out the plot. What was particularly striking about this novel was that the cop (who was investigating Bernie) had feet of clay. This was very surprising. I will not say anymore so that readers will not be told an interesting facet of the plot.In conclusion, this is a nice little book to settle down with when you want to put your brain in neutral (and there is nothing wrong with doing that) and be pleasantly entertained."
3,Not one of his best.,I think Larry tried to fit in a few too many formulae in this one. It seemed a bit strained to me.
2,Never Again,"It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book. I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together. I only made it about half way into the book. I thought there was going to be a mystery here somewhere - maybe that is the mystery. I got to think after awhile that the author was leaving out about every third sentence, it just made that little sense. There are many better books out there."
2,Tell me something I don't already know,"This book is way to general and for most of us (over 40), we know this stuff. If you have not been around too much, maybe it will provide general guideance, but I was disappointed."
5,I Have A Different Version...,"I have a U.S. version of this single, but it's different. It only has the song ""Say You'll Be There"" and the song ""Take Me Home"" and that's it! Oh well. Say You'll Be There is a great song, one of my all time favorite Spice Girls songs. Actually it probably is my favorite Spice tune ever! Take Me Home is another really good song. It's a bit of a darker pop tune, but it's still really good. This is a great purchase. I am trying to collect Spice Girls singles, and this is one of the first ones I bought (since I started collecting). It's a great buy! Highly recommended. Especially with so many used ones for such low prices! ENJOY!!!!!"
2,Practical song,I enjoy listening to the English girls sing this one. The scene from the movie brought me to this. Raw and girly.
5,One of the Best in Spice Globe,"This song was one of the best in Spice Girls history.It's video is even better!If we look at Spice Girls now, we can easily see there's no single as good as Say You'll Be There or Wannabe. (except Viva Forever) It's one of the best Spice songs, it's cathcy and great in every way.But listening it is not as enjoyable as watching the video, it's double fun!"
3,Just opened the box,"I already speak Spanish from a lay person's level and do not have difficulty understanding or being understood. I just felt a need to improve. I wanted to go to the ""official"" bi-lingual level for work/job purposes but had a heart attack. I opened the box just to see what's inside and was disappointed, I gave it away."
5,2 become 1,"This single is great and the real tracklisting is: ""2 become 1"" single version and the unreleased track ""One of these girls"". Still the single is great and if your a fan and collect the cds/singles you'll love this."
3,It came with a little damaged case,I recieved my CD and there are two things I didn't like: it's not the same cover that is posted here and the case came a little broken. The CD was ok.
5,Mis-leading information,"This product has 18kt Solid Gold accents not plated as stated.It has a certified chronometer movement NOT a quartz movement.It's retail price in 2000 was in excess of 2,500."
3,Useable pencil,The pencils are ok quality. Its what would be expected for the lower price. But I don't worry about losing it or breaking it as much if I had a expensive pencil. I personally think the BIC lead pencils are slightly better but those come in huge packs and cost more $$. These pencils do its job though...write stuff.
5,who says women can't fight,"Hook N Shoot took a big gamble by having the first ever all women's MMA card in North American history. After watching this DVD, you will have to agree that the gamble paid off big time. 7 fights in all with only one going past the first round. People who say women MMA fighters have no skill will be forced to shut their mouths after watching this event. All 14 women show amazing heart and they show some pretty impressive skills levels too. The main event has Debi Purcell, my favorite female fighter, taking on Chris Van Fleet. An excellent event that would be a shame if missed."
4,Women in MMA,"This video was very intense and real, just what we hoped it would be. Well worth the money. Most of the women featured are now stars in MMA."
4,Good as far as it goes,"This is a fairly comprehensive little book in a very handy format. Chord changes printed in bold font improve readability over similar small Real Books. Traditional carols are given with at least two verses, some with more. ""Joy to the World"" has all four verses, and ""Good King Wenceslas"" has the whole story. Too bad there aren't more verses for ""O Holy Night.""However, some really classic Christmas material is missing, such as Winter Wonderland, White Christmas, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, and Christmastime is Here (Vince Guaraldi). Let's hope a new edition will include these tunes. But it DOES include Handel's ""Hallelujah Chorus."" That's certainly one which everyone will gather around the piano to sing! Next edition, give harmony parts."
2,Good as a multiplayer...,"This game may be good as a multiplayer but as a one-player game, it isn't anything special. The aiming is terrible and the jerky camera movements are the worst. The graphics seem cartoonish and not really appropriate for this type of game. The story line is lame to say the least but the fact that you get to travel through time is interesting...too bad you will probably die in the first few minutes of a level since you have to be so precise with the aiming. Rent first before you buy. I'm glad I did."
5,Dripping with Style,"This is one of the best games on the market. If you go from Halo to this the controls can be disorienting at first, but once mastered, you'll find the game to be an extremely satisfying experience.Eidos has done a fantastic job of exploiting the power of the Xbox. The framerate blazes and I can't remember one instance of slowdown. The character models are not elegant like Halo but they are stylish, varied, and interesting--combine that with beautiful backgrounds and music and this one really sucks you in. Two player is crisp and clear.All in all, it's hard to find fault with TS2. Be prepared to really master your skills if you want to unlock everything though--challenge mode is really tough."
4,Ai Yi Yi My Head,"I liked the story line of this game, but the controls really put me off. I found this incredibly hard to aim and shoot. The aiming reticle always wants to come to rest in the middle of the screen, rather than staying where you aim it. So what should be an easy and intuitive process (as it is in 99% of other shooters I've played) becomes needlessly fussy and difficult.Also, this is the only first person shooter I've played that actually made me nauseous from just playing it. Lots of turning in small spaces and up and down stairs -- for some reason I just started to get woozy and had to shut it off.I wanted to enjoy it - the story seemed fun - but ultimately had to jettison it due to the frustrating aiming and the bile-inducing movements."
3,aiming is strange,"it's just another shooter that doesn't have anything special about it and the aiming is lousy! the graphics are nice and it has some cool weapons. i would give it 3.75 stars. the aiming held me back from a better rating, if you need a shooter, you won't be dissapointed with this one ..."
4,fun fun fun,"I bought this game because i wanted another first person shooter after i bought turok and was dissapointed. It reminds me so much of goldeneye. Its a really fun game. Cartoonish, but fun. But where would we be in the world today without a little variety. Things needed to be mixed up. The only thing i didnt like about this game was the aiming is really really touchy, that makes it really hard in a congested area of action. I also thought the actual mission part of the game would be better then it was, a little to short. I find myself playing the arcade and challenge series more then the story mode. It is a party game and thats what i really like about it. You can set up your own matches with the computer and play them like you would be against your buddys. Its a must have especially for those first person shooter fans. Its fast paced and over the top fun. Well worth the money. I tend to have good taste in games, so i recomend this game. Grand times."
4,"A fun, difficult game. Great for multiple players.","I already own Halo, and TimeSplitters 2 is currently the only XBox shooter I have found that can challenge Halo in terms of multiplayer goodness.If you and your friends are into First-Person Shooters, this game will probably keep you occupied and challenged for a long while.The controls and multiplayer options are highly configurable. (So much so that it can be overwhelming at first.)The single player game is fun, but tough at the normal level of difficulty. Beginning gamers might be put off by the difficulty.Learning to aim takes time. The aiming controls and options are also configurable.I found the instruction booklet to be pretty useless. It doesn't even attempt to describe what all of the menu options do.Tons of characters. (Watch out for that monkey!) Lots of weapons. (Homing Missiles!) Lots of options. Very good game."
4,Get it today!,"Timesplitters 2 is a great game. This game reminds me very much of Goldeneye on N64. And anyone who has played Goldeneye knows, that it was a great game. The graphics are great. Not quite as great as Halo, but very close. I keep hearing people griping about the controls but the controls are just like Halo. They just take a bit of getting used too. I love the variety of weapons, there are many guns including a flamethrower. For each time period you are in, the guns are matched for that time period. What I really like about the game is that you can play game modes such as challenges. These challenges are pretty much just like multiplayer. So if you are looking for a great game, even if you don't like first-person shooters, you will enjoy this game. I really am 15, but i forgot my password."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I have to say I was pretty disappointed in the game. Every level seemed about the same as the last. I rented it (thank God I was smart enough not to BUY it) thinking that it would get me through the 5 days of downtime I had. Unfortunately, I beat the ENTIRE game in one night. I haven't played the multiplayer levels, so there may be some hope yet."
1,Worst FPS ever made. why did this get ported to XBOX???,"This is the worst first person shooter I've ever played. I was lucky enought to rent this before I shelled out the $$$. Like many of you I saw the cover and read the part about ""first halo now this"" well I can't tell you how much money eidos gave to gamespot for this statement but it had better of been a heafty sum.The gameplay is worthless in this game. Timesplitters only lasted about 5 minutes in my XBOX before I took it back to blockbuster. Graphics are horrible the people move like they are some sort of puppets with broken legs (strange people with extra joints in their legs??? who knows).any other FPS on the xbox is better (even Turok) trust me do not buy this game. punish eidos for even trying to pull this one over on us!"
5,Excellent,"What a fun game. It is by far the second best shooter I have ever played (Halo being #1). I love how you can go to different times, and use different weapons. There is a ton of variety in the game as well, the story mode is entertaining but all the other modes available are awesome as well! I wholly recommend this game to anyone who likes shooters."
1,Worst X-Box Game I've Ever Played,"I was completely dumbfounded when I played this game. Thank goodness I only rented it for three days. It isn't just bad; it makes the original Wolfenstein look brilliant by comparison. The graphics, game-play, story-line (if you want to call it that) are all stupendously awful. I finished the game in roughly the same time it took to sneeze, and yet I'm fairly certain I still spent more time on the game than the designers did. Please protect yourself and rent it first if you are even considering buying it. This is the worst X-Box game or even computer game I have EVER seen. It was just mind-bogglingly awful. A twelve-year-old could put together something better in ten minutes. Just, if you like it, great, but if you've never seen it before, PLEASE rent it first."
1,What the?,"An incredibly difficult to operate game with a boring story and some sorry levels. The controls just stink, in the midst of combat you will find yourself switching from your weapon to a useless motion tracker. To redeem the poor controls most levels have very few bad guys for you to face, so you stand a chance of stumbling through and surviving. If you want a good shooter try Halo, Max Payne, Hitman II."
1,Dumb!!,"You've got to rent,it's the only way to protectyourself from stupid games...And this is oneof them."
5,Harness,this fits my little dog very well and she likes it. I use it in the car and when I walk her.
2,Cook Set review,All of the cups (6) included in this package had their handles broken off down into the cup portion. The other pieces were intact but were smaller than anticipated.
2,A Disappointment,"My two boys rented NHL Hitz 2002, and loved it so much, they wanted one for Christmas. A family friend gave them NHL Hitz 2003 as an early Christmas present (thinking it was the same game). Although they loved NHL Hitz 2002, they hate the 2003 version. The game plays much slower and there are more restrictions than in the 2002 version. If you're thinking of purchasing this game, our family recommends NHL Hitz 2002."
1,Inaccuracy,"The game at first is pretty fun--I like how you can get in goalie fights and check the goalie. The graphics are excellent--each individual players face look exactly like the actual player. The pronounciation of the players names are TERRIBLE. They can pronounce some of the more difficult names, but can't pronounce simple names such as Roy (Wah), etc... The mini games, heads, names of created teams, etc... are really corny, making this game seem to be more for a five-year-old. The game gets boring quick. The game being a checking and fighting game, with no actual rules of the game of hockey in it, makes it very irritating--such as icing, tripping, etc..."
2,Not as good as Nhl Hitz 2002,"Although the graphics are slightly better, this new version of NHL Hitz was very disappointing! I bought it and then turned around and sold it on Ebay! I was so frustrated with the slow play it had to go. There is also no code entries allowed on this version, so if you are used to having unlimited turbo or getting points for winning fights it won't happen here. If you want a realistic hockey game this may be for you, but if you like to smash people through the glass, get into fights and catch your team on fire, stick with the 2002 version."
4,Awesome hockey game!,"NHL Hitz 2003 is the best hockey game i have ever played. Its fun and the hitting is awesome. The graphics are sweet and the controls rock! The hitz are really cool, a little unrealistic but just enough to make it fun over regular hockey games. Also you arent really pestered by too many peneltys but a few obvious ones to keep it real. Also the graphics are really good you can really see the hockey players fly through the glass on hard hitting checks like your there! Over all I give it an A+."
1,useless,"a booking that keeps on repeating and repeating a few thoery over and over again.Always ask you to pay attention at the photos and observe the posture of riders, but you can hardly tell the difference with such a small pic."
5,It helps for the IPhO,"If you are a student who is competing to go to the international physics olympiad then this book is definitely for you... I haven't really received it within the mail it however, essentially all of the US IPhO team has used this book and performed exquisitely.This book is definitely a jewel among rocks."
2,Disappointing,"The product is a very good product but is represented as something it isn't. The description says there are two lock strips with this product but there isn't. I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money and asked me to reorder but the product was removed before I could reorder???? I then contacted MD Products and they said the information on their web site had not been updated for a long time and the product did not include these strips anymore. I replied and suggested that it would be nice if they honored their description, which they did, but with only one strip instead of two. I have no complaint except that this much effort on a customers part should not have to occur. I am posting to let others know, if you purchase this product, don't expect the lock strips to be included. Both Amazon and MD Products have been gracious to partially resolve the problem. Amazon was more than responsive and quick to try and correct the situation and reimburse me for the problem."
4,nice thin face watch,"I really like this watch. The face is nice and thin and the band has loops to hold the extra length of the band close to the watch so even though I have a thinner wrist, the band still looks nice. After wearing the watch occassionally for about a month, part of the band is showing a little wear but overall very nice. I would recommend it"
3,Battery is Dead,I think the watch is gorgeous and not one scratch. I love the watch. The only thing is that the Battery is dead! What am I supposed to do now? Do I send it back to you or do you send me a check to have the battery replaced???
4,Great to jump start your chili,"This chili mix does fine on its own, but it's best when you add your favorite ingrediants. I don't care for most of the Bear Creek soups (very pasty) but this one's worth a try if you don't have a favorite."
2,Nothing to Write Home About,"Based on the reviews I read here I was looking forward to writing my own positive review, but I made two batches in accordance with the instructions on the bag and the flavor was mediocore at best. I did not care much for the rice in the chili either and talk about some serious flatulence! I'm just saying! I have made my chili homemade for a number of years so in all fairness perhaps I was expecting too much from a pre-mix 25 minute chili but even after 6 hours no big flavor imporvements. I won't be making another purchase. I'll give the remaining bags to someone in my neighborhood who wants or is willing to try this product."
4,"Yes...Darn Good, As A Start","I'm a big fan of the Bear Creek soup mixes. I buy them locally all the time. They really don't hold back when it comes to the fixens's, and I always like their flavorful stocks. This chili is nicely spiced and full of flavor for sure, (but not at all hot). But when it comes to fixens' I'm afraid this makes a pretty watery batch without much pizazz unless you add the hamburger as suggested. You can use sausage too, which I actually prefer, or even both for a truly great chili. I also add some more onions for I love my chili thick with them. In any event, this mix takes a lot of time and experimentation out of making chili with the stock being as flavorful as it is. But I would never make it without adding some kind of meat. It's just not darn good chili without it... : )"
1,GROSS-don't buy this!,"Although they make a great instant cheddar potato soup mix, this is what you eat when you have absolutely nothing to eat, i.e. the Apocalypse. It's just awful. A horrible product, why they sell it I don't know, except to maybe dupe the gullible (like me). I made some, tasted it, and threw in the trash. A HORRIBLE waste of money!"
4,Good starting mix,"Good standard chili mix but you'll want to step it up.Add Rotel chili fixings (or just plain Rotel for heat).I like to add red kidney beans, diced red onions, sausage and/or beef.Works very well in a crock pot. Let it cook down and thicken for awesome chili. Works well on hot dogs."
5,The name suites the product,This is DARN GOOD CHILI! I make this for diner when I am tired and feel like a no hassle meal. Just add some water and a small can of tomato paste and Voila! Diner is served. It's also very low on points plus if you are trying to follow the program.
4,Yummy,Loved this...kids finished off the entire pot! I added much more to the recipe as it is quite salty. I would say almost doubled everything...adding corn...black beans...onion etc.
4,Pretty Darn Good,"For those who need some darn good chili fast, here's the answer. This stuff is very open to doctoring and I highly recommend adding at least 12oz of ground beef. Not a huge fan of the rice but I found it to be hardly noticeable. It's a mild chili, so for spice add either cayenne powder or chili powder. About two TBL of cayenne powder whisked in added a nice additional kick for my batch. The alternate recipe on the back of the bag calls for chopped tomatoes but I feel they are unnecessary. My additions were toppings; sweet onions and shredded cheddar. Usually skip the sour cream in favor of ice cream for dessert. Knocks out heat real quick."

2,Sophmoric Machoism,"I was looking forward to this after all the glowing reviews. This was just one paragraph after another of unbelievable adolescent machoism, drug and alcohol use and to finally top it off glib racism and some homophobia just in case you weren't already shaking your head in disbelief. I read it all the way through waiting for something that could be even considered redeemable. Nada."
5,Crazy Good,"Super funny book, excellent fiction story. Great ending, very Hunter S. Thompson like, You'll love it."
5,A perfect mix of themes .......,"Drug dealing and quantum physics..... I didn't know the two themes belonged together, but after reading this book I understand that it is so ! This is an excellent book, an absurd, must amusing story that I never will forget. But I do not have my own copy, please get it back in print !"
5,If Hunter S. Thompson were a nice guy and could write...,"What more can I say? I'm in shock to find that it's out of print, but why should I be...the 2 best books I've ever read were from the remainder bin. This one and Marian Cockrell's ""Mixed Blessings"".One thing I'd like to know...what good is Amazon's search engine if it couldn't find me this book when I searched on the subject ""quantum physics and Mexican drug dealers""?"
5,Cosmic Banditos,"I have know Alan Weisbecker for a couple of years now. He writing credits include scripts for Miami Vice, Crime Story, and STAT. He is also an award winning photographer whose articals and pictures have appeared in magazines such as American Photo, Popular Photography, Surfers Journal, and The BWI Inflight Magazine. It wasn't untill the summer of 1996 when learned about Cosmic Banditos. After many attempts, I finally accuired a copy from Alan to borrow. Needless to say, I still havent retured it. I have read it about twenty times, and seven of my freinds have read it. It is the most outrageous, insane, laugh out loud, hilariously funny book you will ever read."
5,"Just read it, trust me on this one","Seriously, just read it, and then you'll understand.Never before, or since, has a book truly made me laugh out loud and get strange looks from people while riding the train to and from work. You definitely want to pick this one up, and share it with your friends when your done."
3,Kind of disappointing,"Based on the reviews about this book, I decided to check it out. There is an Internet site that has the first 4 chapters online, so I read a couple of the chapters and could not stop laughing. So I bought the book. Then I read the rest. This book is not bad by any means, but it is hampered by Weisbecker's inside jokes and heavy handed humor. A little subtlety really does go a long way, but I don't think Weisbecker knows that. The last few chapters read like one of Hunter S. Thompson's articles and that's not necessarily a complement. The story just takes huge leaps in logic that are hard to reconcile. I would recommend this book to people who are sci-fi fans or love Monty Python, but the rest of you may want to check it out before buying."
2,carlos castaneda meets hunter s. thompson,"not bad, not great. an amusing read, very original in content."
1,The most unintelligible piece of #### I have ever read,"Basically the characters in this book get high, drunk, pass out and then spew fourth random misinformation about physics. This is repeated for 200 mind grueling pages. I love satire and comedy but this is not it."
3,Read In Search of Captain Zero instead,"Despite his apparent cult status, I had never heard of Allan Weisbecker or Cosmic Banditos. I read ""In Search of Captain Zero"" on a whim and was thoroughly impressed - funny, intelligent, thoughtful with lots of ""shake your head, can't believe this guy did this"" kind of anecdotes. So I went in to Cosmic Banditos with some pretty high expectations and unfortunately was not impressed. It wasn't disastrous but I found the humour to be flat, the characters and the plot fun at first but quickly tiresome and the cosmic philosophy, tedious. After having read Captain Zero it's clear where he got the inspiration for the book and I would recommend his 1st person account much more. He doesn't need fiction to make his stories interesting..."
5,laugh out loud,I read this for the first time on a plane trip to somewhere. Laughed out loud the entire book. Am reading again to get myself into the mood for his new book coming out this fall. Cannot wait - but in the spirit of the Don Juan law: anything that can go wrong already has and will be that way forever - so you never know. Some bandito may off him and steal the book before it comes out. If that doesn't make sense to you - you gotta read the book to know what it means. Weisbecker simply rocks.
4,Spanish Chorizo,Very happy with the product. Great flavor. Brings back memories of eating Chorizo in Spain!
2,NOT THE SAME ONE,"DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I SAW 12 YEARS AGO, DID'T LIKE THIS ONE MUCH.TOO MUCH COMENTARY, NOT ENOUGH PERFORMING, MAY TRY AN ORDER AGAIN"
5,Merrybegor or Witch?,"Grace is a Puritan minister's daughter in 1645 England. She's the golden child of the village, delicate and pure, refined and elegant. Nell, the healer's daughter, is her polar opposite. She's a Merrybegot, a child conceived on May Morning. She is wild and unrestrained, a healer and midwife. When Grace and her sister, Patience, are suddenly taken by a violent illness, Nell is accused of witchcraft. In this powerful good-versus-evil story set during the English Civil War, both Grace and Nell's lives are followed, alternating with Patience's confession during the Salem Witch Trials, fifty years later. From the reason behind Grace's supposed illness to Nell's unexpected new friend, this book is a touching and realistic story about two young girls, who, though they lived 350 years ago, really aren't so different than girls today. The story is excellently spun, and even those who don't read much historical fiction can enjoy this sincere and alluring novel."
3,Not best copy,A good CD but as this is the US version it is lacking about 4 tracks that the original UK release had. This I found to my horror when I gave away my original copy to a friend from The US of A. and replaced it with this version from amazon.com.Well that will teach me I guess! Still a great CD though and I still love Amazon.com
3,Disturbing piece of work,"While I am a huge Sting fan, this CD definitely is not one of his best works. Fields of Gold is probably the only good song on there. The rest I found depressing and rather boring. In other words, it needs a lot of work."
2,Bad Collection of Gems,"Of course their are some great songs on here, but the whole bubblegum image A&M tries to place upon Sting to sell a lot of records just doesn't work. Not only does this album make us overlook how meaningful and sophisticated songs like ""They Dance Alone"" and ""All This Time"", but they title it after the one Sting song that I just cannot stand. One does not really need a collection of Stings songs OR the extra tracks on the album. Buy Stings masterpieces--the jazzy Blue Turtles record, the politically based Nothing Like the Sun, the spritual Soul Cages, or even Ten Summoner's Tales (despite the fields of gold thing). Plus, that nude(?) photo of Sting inside? what an ugly, phony gimmick!"
1,misleading at best,"It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94.The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version. It's anemic. Lacks the punch. In a word -- sucks.That you're not told this on the cover is misleading.I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music. All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific. 4-5 stars. But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio."
4,"Good enough for a ""best of"" album","This CD is an excellant overview of Sting's commercial hits, and is sure to please with ""When We Dance"", ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"", ""Fields Of Gold"", ""If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)"", ""All This Time"", and so forth.It does have the weakness, of course, of most ""best of"" compilations in that it shows only the commercial ""top 40"" side of a notable artist. Those who think the only good stuff is that which is played on the radio therefore enjoy this and other ""best of"" collections, and will like this more than any one album.This is a good sampler of Sting's radio hits, but if you want a deeper understanding of Sting, don't stop here, but also listen to the albums which show off the less commercial side of his talent."
3,Listenable in Small Doses,"You don't play a Sting record to feel good. That's my conclusion from this CD of his greatest hits. His serious mood permeates everything, making it a chore to listen in more than small doses, like reading Dostoevski. That's not to say he isn't a talented musician; though close to pretentious as a writer, his lyrics are original and literate. But his intensity makes even a love song like ""Fields of Gold"" seem like a eulogy. In situations where this is appropriate, such as within the songs ""All This Time"" and ""Why Should I Cry For You,"" written after the death of his father and laced with moving metaphors of the father-son bond, he is exceptional and quite moving. There is a lot on this man's mind, and even though this restricts his songs from being anyone's favorites, one has to respect his art."
2,below-average,"I have been a die-hard Amy fan for 15 years, and to tell you the truth, I was disappointed with this album. I never thought Amy would sink to the point where the only song on here album worth listening to is a cover of BIG YELLOW TAXI. The rest of the album is a collection of b-rate songs, lacking the strength and wisdom and depth found on albums like STRAIGHT AHEAD, LEAD ME ON and HEART IN MOTION. Her follow up album to this one, BEHIND THE EYES, is much better. If your looking for a good buy, pass this one over and sink your teeth into BEHIND THE EYES. It has everything HOUSE OF LOVE is lacking."
4,House of Love (import),Though not her best work this is a must have album if your a fan of Amy's. This album is complete with bonus tracks (remix of Say You'll Be Mine and Politics Of Kissing) but are well worth the extra money you have to pay for it. So even if you already have the US version buy this one also. Also check out Lead Me On and Behind the Eyes.
1,Strangely prescient...,"I first heard the title track over the loudspeakers at the supermarket, and was later appalled to find out that it was Grant and Vince Gill -- I mean, I actually liked it! Later, when I saw the video for the song on VH1, my first thought was: ""These two are definitely having it off [well, at the very least in their hearts],"" which I thought was fairly amusing at the time, what with her being so holy and all. And whaddya know - I was right! The title track is the only worthwhile song on the CD, Grant's cover of Joni Mitchell's ""Big Yellow Taxi"" being pretty much of an embarrassment. Worthwhile only for the gossipy aspects."
3,Better Than I May Have Expected,"This type of album is definitely not my personal cup of tea, but I must admit that Amy Grant is good at what she does. Her songs are straightforward and well-constructed, particularly her hit duet with Vince Gill, ""House of Love"". My only problem here is the unabashed sweetness of the sentiments that drip over each track. I tend to prefer a bit more reality, but if you love kittens, go to church religiously and believe in true love, you'll probably disagree with me vehemently on this one. The thing is, I believe that Amy Grant is not pretending to be something that she isn't, so although her pure-at-heart sentiments make me suspicious, at least it isn't disgusting treacle. - Tom Ryan"
1,Why ruin a classic song,"Why did she have to trample Vanessa Williams hit ""Oh How The Years Go By"". She should have left the song alone. If you want an album of remakes try the lovely ""Everlasting Love"" by Vanessa Williams. This is headed for the discount bin."
4,Crystal is exactly correct,"This would be a great set if that center spring-loaded pin punch didnot wobble. After removing the hex bolt at the other end of the handle,the plastic grip can be slide aside,revealing a set screw which allows pin punch and spring removal.This pin has a bearing surface OD of about 9.0mm,which is an unacceptably loose fit in the 9.8mm bore.A larger OD pin, to eliminate wobble, requires cleaning up that bore."
4,gasket punch set,"I bought this tool to make ""washers"" for dye bottles I was using. I found that the awl portion of the punch that allows you to center a second punch, as I needed to do, was aggravating as it wobbled a bit. Solution was to have hubby grind it off in the shop. Seems to punch better thru thicker material rather than thin stuff like the foam sheets I was using to make the washers. 2 sheets of foam punched better than 1 and I had half the work. Very happy I bought this and plan to use it frequently as I have many dyer friends!"
2,Flimsy,"If you just need to use it occasionally or very lightly, not a bad purchase ""for the money"". But if you want something decent that will hold up, look elsewhere. Also, the guide does NOT center up correctly at all. A bad design."
2,Not 'SHARP' at all,"I received the punch set yesterday and tried it out last night on a piece of 1/16"" thick chipboard. I wanted to make a couple of round tokens for a game. It took several (more than 10) hits just to get through the chipboard. When it finally did, the bottom of the token was really ragged and ripped up. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but it seems to me, these punches fail in a big way. My dad works at a machine shop and he may be able to help sharpen them...If you plan on using punches quite often, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Mayhew offers a set, but it's not cheap. Good luck to anyone that tries these."
1,CRAP!,"I bought this for cutting circles out of felted wool. I tried cutting on 1,2,3,&4 layers all unsucessfully.I used a hard self healing mat underneath and then tried with wood underneath. Will only cut partial circles or not at all!. *I was able to cut the 1/2"" circles through 2 layers some of the time but the larger circles were unsucessful. These are not sharp! Totally not worth the time or money for this application! Wish I'd seen a review like this before. I was very excited to see the larger circle sizes, most only go to 1/2"" and smaller. I would be interested to know if anyone has found a punch that does work well on felted wool with larger circle sizes."
1,Dull and useless,"I originally purchased these punches to punch out holes in carpet, well that was a no go. These punches appear to be well constructed and came in a nice carrying case, but they are so dull and I have no idea how to sharpen them. At first I figured maybe carpet is too much for these punches, so just to test them out I tried to punch some holes in cardboard thinking it should slice through it like butter. Wow, that was a no go too, it basically just scored the cardboard, but didn't even penetrate and we're talking about the cardboard from basic shipping boxes, nothing heavy duty. I tried punching the cardboard on solid surfaces and softer surfaces, neither produced a hole in the cardboard. Total waste of money."
3,Very Much Not Interested...,"What's with 2 hour tutorial in the begining of the game. It felt like a never ending complexity of instructions and directions and...use this camera angle and this button does this..but you can only do this....blah blah....that is how you choose this.... I just want to play....finally. I have no idea what's going on with this game. But judging by the graphics, sound and control not much time was spent in design....It's junk. Maybe if I took some time to learn how to play. Maybe not....I'm just no interested. NEXT!"
1,Inappropriate War Game for Young Teens,"At a time when we should be doing all we can to avert a war with Iraq, this game promotes war and killing in Iraq to our young teenagers. I, as a parent of a 13 and 16-yr old, do not want my kids playing games that teach them how to kill with graphic, real-life cartoon characters. As a nation, we should be promoting peace, not war, to our children. Those who profit from such games, and desensitize our children about the horrors of real war and death, should be ashamed."
4,Good Stuff,"I tought the game play was good. Great detail in the tanks and pesonnel carriers. Hard to see enemy when they where far away but they had no problems finding you, then your trying to find out who the hell is shooting. I was a bit disapointed that there were not enough levels. I great game all the same."
4,Conflict: Desert Storm,"Finally something new in the gaming world of war. Previously we were engrossed in WW2 based games such as ""Medal Of Honor Frontline"" for the PS2 and the previous Medal Of Honor series for the PS1. However, ""Conflict :Desert Storm"" just takes us about a decade back, and reflects the events which occured during the Gulf War.This game can be played in both 1st and 3rd person view. You can interact with fellow soldiers, aiding you in aqquiring your goals. Get yourself buckled up in an American F-15 or a British Tornado and go find yourself some targets to destroy.Overall, this game gives you the role of both a fighter pilot aswell as a soldier, so its going to be loads of fun. And yeah, the blood's on the house!!"
2,Not a big fan...,"I bought this game sight unseen on the advice of a friend. After playing it for a few weeks, I have decided that I will not buy take the advice of this friend anymore.This game is OK but it just feels lame and I wasn't able to get into it. I had great expectations of a war game where I would be able to blast Iraqis. Instead, I got a game with a cheesy plot, poor controls, and low quality graphics."
3,FUN BUT HARD,conflict desert storm is HARD. I could not get passt level 4 . Now on to the good stuff. Fun Levels cool guns and Lots of fun stuff. I like Desert storm 2 A bit Better. I Love this game cuz its fun and cool and it has good game play
4,"Great game, but could use a little work.","I very much enjoyed this game. The play is exceptional and the wide variety of weapons is great. The ""light fifty"" is the best. I would have given the game five stars, but the AI's ability to see you no matter where you go is a bit frustrating. I don't see any possible way that a mission can be completed in complete stealth. The Iraqi soldiers could be five miles away and they are able to determine who you are."
2,What were they thinking?,"This game looks and plays like it was designed for the PS1 and ported over to the PS2. The main problem is the graphics and framerate, the player models and textures are terrible and the gameplay is anything but smooth and consistent. As far as the actual gaming goes apparently the iraqis have super eyesight because the can see you from the moon and have the accuracy of olympic sharpshooters while you're left shooting at a single pixel of in the distance with little idea what your shooting at, where it is, and if you're hitting anything. This games a stinker, go get socom instead and save yourself a migraine from all the flickering."
1,Lousy Game,"This game is horrible. Control is very akward, graphics are not up to par with current games, and the game seems to have been rushed into production. If you want a game in this genre, look to SOCOM for the PS2. It is the best out there by far."
4,Yawn!,"This game isn't what I expected. It just amplifies the notion that America is good and the other country is bad. PLEASE! God Bless America... for what!Anyway, this game is just mindless shooting and emphises the fact that war is a game. The best part in the game is when you get to ride in a jeep. Instead of this game, get Ghost Recon or SOCOM: Navy Seals. Man, that was a waste of [$]."
3,The Game Was Too Easy,"At first the game was challenging, but then after a while after I got use to the controls it got a little bit easier. The graphics are okay. Their not that good and their not that bad. The game wasn't challenging at all. Even when I was playing on hard difficulty it was easy. When you blow up a tank it dosen't look realistic at all. Plus when you blow up a helicopter it looks like a bunch of pieces flying everywhere. Once there was a helicopter and I shot it 10 times with a sniper rifle and it blew up. Plus the enemies die too easy. Plus when you're reloading it looks like you're just moving your hand up and down. Plus their version of a Black Hawk Helicopter is horrible. Plus you can carry about 20 anti-tank weapons and it would look like you're carrying nothing. Their Chinooks looks good though. If you want an easy game this is the game for you, but if you want something a lot cooler and challenging get Socom: US NAVY SEALs."
3,alrighty then...,"Okay first off I was anticipateing this game to be great. Well it kinda went under expecttations to be met. Now this is a pretty solid game throughout but i have some quarells with it.Pro's:Pretty damn challenging game. I mean HARD!Good, Solid grapics and environments.C'mon you get to kill Saddam!!!!!Cons:Nothing spectacular.Awful auto aim. It targets enimies closetest to me, not the ones who are SHOOTING at me!The target cross hairs move you back to your default position at a nosiating speed.We can tell that's not real voice acting, trust me.Overall: 3.75/5"
3,so so game,i thought this game would be a lot better than it turned out to be i personally liked socom: us navy seals better this game(desert storm) has very weak graphics for a new ps2 game..i probably would expect this from a playstation origional game but i think the graphics in socom are a lot better
2,too easy,"Great graphics, great idea, great game play, but I beat it in 2 days after renting it from Blockbuster. Since there aren't enough missions and too easy I give it a 2 star rating. I prefered Hitman 2 it has more missions and is over all more fun since it takes longer to beat."
3,"its good if you have a really, really, good memory","When i first heard about this game i thought it would be a really good game! But when i played it, the controls were really hard! I had to keep on looking at the controls in the booklet! It has good details, auto-aiming, and good videos before hand. And another thing, i riped out the rocket launcher(to shoot a tank)and all-of-a-sudden it was gone and i had nothing to hurt it! Thats what i think of Desert Storm."
1,"sorry, but this game ...","i really wanted to like this game but it was not possible. i read all the reviews (for and against) before purchase and decided what the hell. one review i read said this game plays likes it's on ps one. ditto. this is unaccpetable. i'll admit i was coming off just having played socom and was looking for more of the same. you'd have more fun playing socom over again. this game is slow, choppy and awkward. playability is very poor. half the time you are a sitting duck for the iraqis, you can't see them but they can somehow see you. this game could have and should have been so much better. i'm now playing socom again."
5,It depends on who you are,"This game is more of a strategic game if anything. After the first 2 missions you get all 4 guys in your team. The basic gist of the game is to utilize all of your guys special traits and [defeat] the enemy. There are basically two ways to do it, silently or just straight out fight them. I always like the straight out fight but unlike first person shooters you can't charge the enemy, you let the enemy come to you and then [defeat]them.Something of caution, you control all the guys on your team. When your not controling them they will [defeat] the enemy on their own.I recomend this game, it was fun."
5,COOL AWESOME,"i Liked this game first of all because you can use different weapons and the most important is that in this game you could play both in a misson! I love that.My brother never let me by a game as socom or ghost reacon because is one player,but desert storm is up to two in a mission!"
3,NO where does it mention...,"the art work is great. no doubt about it, but there is no mention of the fact that the whole book is in Black and White...no color...I really would not have bought it if i had known."
4,"Cute, pretty, and erotic female elves!","Melanie certainly has talent! Her pretty female elves are a joy to behold, with most of them wearing very little in the way of clothing! Also, I especially liked the occasional girl/girl theme along with the bits of bondage here and there.If I didn't give this one five stars it's because I think Melanie's ""erotica quotient"" needs to be just a little bit higher. Too many of the drawings looked staged, almost as if the eleven girls are posing for a camera. And despite some flashes of eroticism, the overall images are somewhat tame with the same expressions and imagery. Still, not a bad collection just the same."
5,A Thoughtful Reflection on Life's Lessons,"In this warm and highly personal little book, the author, Lon Emerick shares humorous anecdotes and profound experiences from his life which highlight ten simple lessons he has gleaned along the way. His is a life shaped by his love for his family, his life long passion for Nature, and his experiences as a professor, naturlist, and speach therapist in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Chapters each highlight a specific way of looking at life such as ""Don't Wear a Raincoat in the Shower"" and ""Don't Pole Vault Over Mouse Turds"". This book is sensitively written, makes wonderful read and is a great gift for someone you care about."
2,"Good for execs, not for techs.","As a introductory primer, this book is passable. As a systems engineer, it offered what I'd term ""common sense"". There were some formulas to make calculations but not enough, in my opinion, to justify the price. I have not downloaded the online materials yet (including the promised data center design diagrams), but the examples in the book are laughably obvious (at least to a tech).If you are an executive, this book would be an good resource. Technicians, particularly those with a few years exposure to different data center environments, will find the content mostly redundant. There are a few bright spots, but not enough."
3,Review ---Good not great!,"This book is good but misses or skirts over several important issues.Does not talk about tiers and what they mean, does not talk much aboutelectrical amd mechanical infrastructure and redundancy. Focuses on detailswhich are useful to know but miss the big picture."
5,The Dead Retell Their Tale of Sorrows,"THE SULTANA SAGA is an epic tale of tragedy in American past, which as faded from history. Rex Jackson brings alive the dead to retell their tale and sorrows with his vivid research and historical accuracy on the event. In side the pages, of the Sultana Saga, you will find your heart wretch as you look at your own life compared to the poor souls that hat to experience this tragedy. This is a forgotten tale, which must be told, must be read, and Rex has done a splendid job."
3,Conestoga River Watershed Project,"This is a biography of one man's vision, efforts and results to clean up a watershed and promote the history found therein.It documents identifying the problems, the cure and the progress in the effort to create a public space available to all,while documenting the historic bridges, buildings, life and transportation aspects of the subject."
3,Many Topics on Schools Connecting To Families,"The quintet of editors in this book sculpt exactly what we need if we use the title as a guide: lots of excellent essays on the issues and topics encouraging, discouraging, and expanding home-school communication.Please get this book if you can, but do not let it stand as your only resource in this topic. Please check out books by Kevin Swick, Nancy Chavkin, Diane Hiatt-Michaels, James Comer, Joyce Epstein, the team of Anne Bauer/Thomas Shea, and Ellen Galinsky."
1,"It works, but it's not the best way. Recommend against it.","Number 1: This is not a book for anyone who's starting out with ear training. It's not fun, it's tedious, you'll get bored and stop.Number 2: I don't recommend it for more mid-level students. Same reasons as above, only slightly fewer people will drop out (maybe).Number 3: I don't recommend it for advanced and atonal sight reading. There are better books for one. Again, this will work, but it's hard to imagine people finishing it. But if you're truly dedicated, and mind numbing exercises work with you, give it a try. Think of it as a slot machine. It might work, but the odds are against it, and you'll regret the money spent.FYI - I've got a MA in Music about 35 yrs ago and I've taught sight reading."
2,One of the worse movie to game translations EVER,"I don't know where to start on how horrible this game is. The action [is not good], what's up with using the right analog stick to attack ,and the non-descript enemies make for an even worse time.This was clearly a waste of money."
3,blade 2,"this game is better than the first but not by much. dispite having good graphics and all, this game was still a dissappointment. it is , however, worth renting to check it out. it was a bit fun but still very flawed and is not worth throwing [money] on, like i did..."
1,What a Joke,My friend recomended I get this game..ITS SOOOO SWEET! IT'S SOOOO VIOLENT....This game is soooo stupid is what I told him. This games story was pretty intresting at first but then it all falls down.UGH! The graphics are horrible! The combos are unique..One of em' I'm still trying to learn but I stoped with the game.The game is pretty violent but as Violent as I thought it would be.The game gets pretty boring after awhile and it's very dull.I'd give it 0 stars if I could...But I can't... :(Well If you wanna waster your time with the game be my guest...I'm forcing you not to play the game cause hey...I can't..what els is there to say....So go out and buy it with your own opinion.But for me...I'm gonna have to say this game sucks big time...
3,Unusually Creative,"I couldn't put this book down. I read it in one night. It was fast paced and disturbing at times, but entertaining. After reading the book I had the opportunity to talk to the author, Scott, about it. He asked my opinion and I told him honestly, ""I think that you are highly disturbed, but without shadow there can be no light."" He replied that at least I could look him in the eyes after reading it. Yes, the subject matter gives one pause about the mind of the author, but how refreshing for a new writer to have the boldness to print something that is outside the box."
4,the anti-war poem of vietnam era still resonates,"one of ginsberg's best poems: (ranks right up there with howl and kaddish). wichita vortex sutra deals with the poet's search for truth as he crosses the plains of the midwest on the way to poetry readings during the vietnam era. a poetic masterpiece in the vein of whitman as if whitman himself were in the driver's seat coaxing ginsberg on. it is also a poem of loneliness, of loss and of spiritual search as well. recorded with various musicians toward the end of the bards life it stands out as a masterful achievement of one of the prominent voices of the last century. though the music sometimes distracts, allen's poetic vision shines through brightly. this recording is an epic must have for anyone who loves poetry especially recorded poetry. in these days of war and rumours of war much of what was written by allen in this poem still rings true. and that's the sad thing."
4,Do the best for running purpose. Not for heavy sports.,"The cap is 1"" (Width) x 1 3/8"" (Length) in brand new condition. The silicone is very stretchy, the wider it stretches the more it sacrifices the length, technically it may stretch to 1 1/2"" (W) or 2"" (L) maximumly.I wear size 6 1/2 (women's), normal width. It covers my great toe perfectly, it seems able to cover two other toes if necessary. It is soft, provides noticeable confort to the toes during exercise. I do different types of exercise alternatively during the week, including running, cardio, and basic kenpo. It lasts longer and helps a lot for running purpose, I do light running, about 5 miles/week, they were able to be reused a couple of times. It wears out fast if the exercise requires various of foot movement, it looks out of shape after one-hour heavy cardio or kenpo exercise."
4,one time usage,"Good deal & I loved the product (its worked) but found they only lasted a very short time. I'm a womans size 8 but they were a little big so I'd have to tape them down as well to isnure they didnt falloff. I'd buy again if there was a smaller size, lasted and I had really fat toes :)"
4,Pro-Tec Athletics Toe Caps,"The Toe caps fits my big toe. Other toe caps I have purchased are not large enough for the big toe. These toe caps are a little thin in thickness, I had to double it to get enough protection I needed for my toes."
1,Toecaps,"This product is very misleading. It shows a toecap on the big toe and states that one size fits all.For a child, this may be true. --Definitly not for a man! These toecaps are way too narrow and way too smallto fit on a big toe. I give it a zero!"
3,Didn't work for me,"These did not work for me. They kept peeling off. I have a toe that was previously broken and it's always very swollen, so perhaps if it weren't they would stay on."
2,SORE TOES,"The product is overpriced for the value received. Packaging was okay, but probably cost more than the product. Would not purchase again."
1,Way to small,"These are so small only can be used on smaller toes. You have to be a small child.Snake oil, cheap and worth a few bucks if that. Stay away."
3,unused toe caps shrink during storage,"I bought several packs of these silicone caps in one purchase in order to save on shipping. I only wear these on my big toe to play soccer, and they last about 4-6 games, or 10-14 hours of athletic wear. This is 50-100% longer than other brands I've tried, such as Profoot Toe Bandages and Pedifix gel products.However, as I went through the packs I discovered that the silicone caps appear to shrink during storage. New ones gradually got so tight that I couldn't wear them more than an hour because they cut off the circulation and my toe went painfully numb.I wear a womens size 7 shoe, so this one-size-fits-all product is probably not designed for a big toe. While I still recommend this product in general, I have switched to Pedifix Nylon-covered toe caps for my big toe.Hope y'all find this helpful!"
2,Not For All Sizes,"I bought this package thinking that at least one of the toe caps would be suitable to go over a great toe, based on the image shown. Not so. They are all small and suitable for the four smaller toes only. They are much too tight for the great toe."
1,False advertising,"These are junk. First, they are not as long as pictured,they hardly fit down to the first joint of my big toe.Second, they are so narrow that on my size 10 feet, they werehurting my toes, almost cutting off circulation.Finally, one split this first time I wore them with my hiking bootsrendering it useless.Perhaps they might be of value if you have tiny feet but otherwise,worthless. Additionally, they are advertised as one size fits alland that is a deliberate mis-statement.Save you money, don't bother with these."
2,Nothing like the picture,They are very thin transparent covers that provide hardly any protection. The only way that I got it to help SOMEWHAT was by doubling them up.
4,Squash toe protection,"""Great product, i play squash for 20 hrs a week and my feet are starting to resent it, i lost 2 or 3 nails over the past 6 months and really needed to do something about it. Its hard to adjust at the beginning (feels a little bit weird) since i've never used anything before, but instantly you feel secure. Do not wear for a long time, since the toes need to breath. (after2-3 hours ur toes will start to feel compressed)""I'll have to keep on wearing them to see further results, ill let u know!"
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered these toe caps with the thought that they would be like those I had used from another company. I should have been suspicious of the ""one-size fits all"" part of the description, because in retrospect, I realize that a cap that can both fit the big toe and the baby toe would either have to stretch too thin or be too bulky. When I tried these out on the big toes where I needed them, they simply didn't stay on and bunched up inside my shoes, which was unfortunate as I was playing soccer at the time."
1,Waste of money,These rubber toe tips tear very easily. A few uses and they are shredded. Better to use bandage or adhesive tape.
1,NOT FOR ADULTS,"These toe caps, (I purchased them for my big toes)......are for the toes of a 5 year old. Ridiculous. It says ""one size fits all"".....they must be high. Maybe they mean fits all Keebler Elves."
1,Dont waste your money!!,My daughter wore once to play soccer (to prevent getting blisters on her big toes) and they ripped through..the FIRST time she wore them!!! Called the company who makes them and they refunded my money...wish they worked!! :(
2,Toe Cap Review,"I bought these to try out because my feet have been taking a beating from the dress shoes I have to wear to work each day. I was very excited when I first tried them out on my big toes because they fit great and you really don't even notice that they are on. But, after the first day of wearing them, I was pretty unhappy to see that they were both torn and no longer protecting the part of my toe that needs protecting. My nails are short and smooth so I don't know why the ripped. I had hose over them to protect the protector from my shoe. So, the search continues ......."
2,Didn't work for me at all,"Likely it was my own problem - I had been getting toe pain when running more than 3miles or so - I bought these and put one on the toe in question - btw easy to use and fit fine - but it seemed to make it worse - perhaps the room it took squished the toe. Anyway, if you are trying them for the first time only buy one - I now have two packs sitting at home."
2,"Protects nails, but gives blisters","To give some reference - I have run 6 marathons thus far and have gotten black toenails after each marathon (my toenails no longer fall off). I purchased these caps with the hope that they would prevent my toenails, which they did. However, I did end up getting some blisters where the caps ended and ran into my foot (so, at the base of my toe). Not sure I would recommend these as the blisters were pretty painful during the marathon and the toenails never bother me until AFTER the marathon is over. So whether you want to buy them or not depends on which is more important to you - no black toenails or fewer blisters."
4,Solid album,"""Naughty Little Doggie"" is a very decent album by Iggy after his previous work, the great ""American Caesar"". If you like records such as ""Instinct"" or ""Raw Power"", you'll get a kick out of this one. Iggy sounds very good and it's a very solid album. The production level is great, one of the best in any album by Iggy. If you enjoy listening good, sincere and confrontational rock, then this album is for you. Play it loud and challenge your neighbours with it."
2,On the right track..,"Naughty Little Doggie is Iggy's return to a more hard rock sound after taking a detour with his terrible Bowie/Glam/New Wave phase. The problem is the album lacks aggression. Its not raw and angry and powerful like RAW POWER. In fact, its really boring and bland. But it put Iggy back on track and in 2001 he recorded his hard, nasty, aggressive masterpiece BEAT EM UP!"
3,Iggy Pop - 'Naughty Little Doggie' (Virgin),"Put out in 1996,until here recently I was never even aware of this Iggy Pop catalog title.Maybe not Iggy's best work,by ANY means but still decent.Tunes I thought were,at least worth mentioning are ""I Wanna Live"",the down and dirty rocker ""Pussy Walk"",""Outta My Head"" and his well played Johnny Thunders(NY Doll's late guitarist)tribute ""Look Away"".Fair weather fans may not get as much as I did out of this title,but the completists and die-hards can tell you it's fairly good rock&roll,Detroit style."
2,Not Iggy's Best,"The sound on this album is grungily unnerving, especially after a complete listen. ""To Belong"" is one of the strongest tracks, lyrically and musically. It has a great individualistic theme. ""Pussy Walk"" is not funny (like ""Pussy Power"" on Brick by Brick is), not sexy, not fun; it's disgusting and unlistenable. The album cover is depressing, and so is much of this CD. Get it for 1 or 2 good songs; otherwise, you'd do better with just about any other Iggy CD, whether before or after this one."
5,Intuos Pen and Tablet,Just great help in my day by day work ... Love it when using photoshop ..Drawing masks around the objects much better then with the mouse ... Planning to draw some pictures in Photoshop in the future...Intuos pen and tablet is a gret help
5,Absolute Necessity!,"Where did I put my Wacom Pen? I can't function without it!Seriously, I love my Wacom tablet and pen! It is well worth the price for the artist to be able to draw with something that simulates the feel of a pencil, brush, pen, crayon, ect. Trying to draw on the computer using a mouse is a drag!"
5,Great CD.,"I first heard this CD in Australia. I had the US version, but the import is much better. It has a few different songs which are wonderful. The remastering is terrific - the songs are very clear."
1,to old to work,"I was so excited about buying a dongle but very upset that it didn't work. It was to outdated to work on the newer items. I will say one good thing about this transaction, was that when I told the company about it not working, they immediately refunded me my money."
4,Classics,I am an English Teacher and this short story is one that my students regularly read. I had been looking for a high quality DVD or VHS version. This is great.
5,How is this band so unknown?,"I have ""dragline"" and ""death to traitors"" I've been saying for years now that Paw is the MOST underrated band ever. They're virtually unknown but both their albums are amazing. Whoever promoted these guys should have been fired."
4,"If You Read Restoration Drama at All, You'll Want to Review These Titles","Right, Restoration drama (1660-1700) is probably an acquired taste--even on the stage. So you would probably want to start your reading of Restoration drama with a more general anthology. But if you have a general understanding of the standard plays and want to know about significant plays by women, then this is the book for you. Includes the following: Aphra Behn, Sir Patient Fancy; Mary Griffith Pix, The Spanish Wives; Susanna Centlivre, A Bold Stroke for a Wife; Mercy Otis Warren, The Group; Frances Burney, The Witlings; Hannah Cowley, The Belle's Stratagem; Elizabeth Inchbald, Such Things Are."
5,A fascinating page-turner,"Paul M. Edwards' The Angel Acronym is an involving and original mystery, featuring the head director of church education, Toom Taggart, who suspects foul play when the church archivist is found dead in the temple complex. A dark and twisted tale of hidden motives, and the conflicting politics of bureaucracy, religious zeal, and public perception, The Angel Acronym is a fascinating page-turner to be read closely to the last page."
4,More life from a toner cartridge.,"Last week, my color cartridges reached 2000 pages each and stopped printing. I was able to instruct my CM1015 MFP to continue printing in color WITHOUT replacing cartridges by selecting the following command sequence from the LCD menu:Press the ""Menu"" button and then select.....System SetupPrint QualityReplace SuppliesOverride OutThe factory default is ""Stop At Out"", which means that when a color cartridge reaches 2000 pages or the black cartridge reaches 2500 pages, the printer will stop printing. ""Override Out"" means that the printer will ignore the cartridge end-of-life sensor and continue printing.This will allow you to keep printing until the toner actually runs out and the print quality begins to suffer.My only regret is that I did not find this configuration setting until after I had already replaced a not-quite-empty black cartridge."
1,Cheap HP printers Hidden TONER costs Revealed,"Beware of HP CHEAP LASER PRINTERS. Specifically the CM1015 and 1017. HP laser printers are expiring the toner cartridges regardless of the actual toner used. I printed 8000 pages of pure Black and White with all color turned off in the driver. I had to replace $240 in color toner cartridges to use the printer even thought we printed NO color. Went to Cartridge world to have them opened, and sure enough they were completely full. If I would have know this, no way would I have purchased a CHEAP HP laser printer. I smell a class action in the making."
1,broke down after 3 months of low usage,"This printer has been a great disappointment.I used it rarely but it broke after 3 months.I get an error message ""scanner error 14..."" for which no information is provided online. A google search showed me that others have experienced a similar error but nobody knows how to address it.This is a very expensive printer and completely unreliable.Do yourself a favour, don't purchase this printer."
1,Avoid,"Bought this printer to go along with a new 64 bit Windows 7 computer. At the time HP didn't have a working driver even though the box said it was Windows 7 compatible. Had to use the printer on an older XP machine. A year later, HP support still doesn't offer a full function driver or show any intent to write one. Sales dept offered a $20 discount towards a new printer and to just throw away my $400 worth of toner cartridges I have in inventory. Very disappointed."
2,Mac users AVOID!,"Though this multifunction printerHP CM1015 Color Laserjet All in One Printerworks well (good quality images), the Macintosh support from HP (maybe all support?) is awful. I am quite experienced with scanner software and with Macintosh computers. Still, I could not get the scanning function to work with my new iMac and OX10.5. No amount of effort on the Web got me to a useful help mode. Many of the pages I pulled up implied only windows support from HP. Many help pages seemed quite out of date. So, though the device might work OK, if you can't get support, I'd advise not buying a HP product."
2,Alright game,interesting characters. If you're a real soccer fam stay away from this because they allow you to do everything that's illegal (there's no refs) a little too fast and gets boring after a while.
2,terrible recording; aggressive playing,"Maxim, how can you let the recordists do this to you?Among the reasons for classical music's decline is how it is recorded - multi-miked tracks destined for assembly at a mixing board. Listening to several of Vengerov's recordings with orchestra, his steely, over-close sound can be forgiven as a recording artifact. (The Britten and Walton are not too bad). One can attribute the lack of individuality of playing and of sound to the recording style.But what is one to make of his solo recital album? How can a solo violin be made to sound like the Wehrmacht in full force? The sound is ten feet tall and hard as nails. Has any violin sounded like this in real life? The recording is extremely close, and then drowned in phony ambience to make it sound like it is actually somewhere -- in the abstract halls of heaven."
2,Vengerov's butching of ysaye,"Vengerov has some interesting thoughts on music, i must say, but when he picks up the violin, he goes overboard. Just listen to the intro of Obsession. its sloppy, uneven, and just horendous...the rest of the pieces aren't much different. PLEASE do yourself a favor and save 7 dollars and gain infinite musical joy by getting Ilya Kaler's Ysaye sonatas..."
5,A Must Have for Music Lovers!,Chad's music is so creatively brilliant and stunning. The ostinatos are a beautiful display of talent and artistry. I highly recommend this CD for any person who loves and appreciates music.
5,"""An excellent, comprehensive reference guide to understanding, deploying, and sustaining a lean operation.""","I highly recommend it to managers, practitioners, and front-line workers. Easy to follow and understand. The maturity matrix at the end is a great finishing point that motivates you to continue with your own operation!"
4,Great,"This is the best overview of the events leading up to seccession and civil war that I have read. Lucid, well organized and a pleasure to read."
5,A Must Read for any interested in the Civilwar,"Easily the best narrative of the times leading up to the civil war. Of all the causes, Potter singles out slavery as the catalyst and the issue most divisive. While not leaving out other causes, he gives his reasons for subordinating them.The most pedagogical book on the subject I've read. Still, able to convey the passions of the times. Because passionate times they were which is difficult to a modern day reader to understand. The author is long gone dead which attests to the quality of the book despite the out poring of books on the subject."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I've been trying to research Phoenix for some time and believed this book would shed some more light on the subject, but it really offered no profound insight over and above what I've picked up through various sources. The book does not read like a ""spy novel"" as it was billed. I'm hoping at some point in the future, with declassification of various operations, that more about Phoenix will become available. What the author described about his experiences in Vietnam are actually pretty basic offensive counterintelligence activities. Was hoping for more, but was ultimately dissapointed by the story he told."
4,good reading.....,"I read a lot of books history and books by soldiers who went and survived. This book kept my interested and now finished and anyone who buys it will enjoy, would recommend to buy..."
2,stalking the Viet Cong,AUTHOR GOES INTO TOO MUCH UNNECESSARY AND REPETITIVE DETAIL WHICH MAKES IT VERY HARD TO KEEP READER INTERESTED.
2,"Flimsy, harder to fold than other circle shades","The shade material is fine, the problem is with the wire frame. I'm usually really good at folding these type of wire frame circle things but this one is ridiculously difficult to get control of because the wire is so flimsy that it doesn't have enough structure to maintain it's form."
1,Useless Avoid,"I had a spring type sun shade in my other cars. My Honda Fit has a much larger windshield, so I ordered first the Jumbo shade 28X31 which wasn't large enough, came in two panels and was nearly impossible to fold, then I ordered Super Jumbo magic sunshade 31 x 38 inches http://www.amazon.com/Basix-Magic-Shade-Sunshade-Styles/dp/B000G72UOQ (out of stock at Amazon) don't bother looking. The Super Size shades are even harder to fold, I gave up and they are sitting unfolded in my garage.Yes, I have a garage at home, and drive to work and park in a garage, but on a hot day I would like to pop open a sun shade to cool my car, but these products are lousy compared to the old ones that fit the standard car windows."
3,Sun Shade,"For the price I paid, it is good deal.Its served the purpose, keep the temperature inside the car some 4 to 6 F below the outside temperature. Initially I used to struggled folding the shade , but once you know the trick it is easy. But one thing is still I can't fold the shade inside the car.Every time need to come out and fold it."
2,eye-gouging goodness enclosed,"Pros: very large (almost too large for my Camry), highly reflective, cheapCons: flimsyOne of this pair failed the first time it was collapsed. The thin springy strip of metal that makes these things work is held in a loop by a crimped piece of aluminum that holds the two ends together. On the one that failed, the crimp was positioned asymmetrically and was unable to withstand the stress generated during folding. Then the ends of the metal strip poked through their fabric enclosure immediately. I was unable to repair it because of the poor positioning of the crimp.The other one is still working and by itself is almost big enough to cover the entire windshield. I plan to replace it, however, since when the other one failed it did so without warning, and the ends of that metal strip are dangerous when they burst out at you."
4,Nice value for the money,"I like these window shades a lot. I like that they are somewhat malleable, so I can shape them around the areas where the sun is coming in, not just the windshield. I like that they fold up into smaller size than the longer, ""accordian""-type shades. I wish they were easier to fold up though, it can be a bit of a struggle."
2,A little less than expected,"They work. That's the good news. They're also unweildly to store in the back seat or wherever after each use because mine are not easily reshaped back to their compact dinner plate size. Try as I might, one of them refuses to cooperate so I go with a mishmash sized screen that immediately unfolds itself at first chance.The quality of the shades leaves something to be desired. Flimsy is the word and not engendering confidence of a long life. Still, they work for the purpose intended and might, MIGHT I say, be better than those cheap cardboard foldout shades. Given a choice, I wouldn't buy them again and would most likely apt for the cheapie cardboard types until I could find something better and of higher quality/ease of use than this product."
1,gravely deficient info in ad,"This is a review of the Amazon ad, not the product.The product is unknown after reading the ad.I cannot tell even the most basic info about this product from this advertisement.I need a ""super jumbo"" size, which means the largest that is made for huge windshields.The ad heading says super jumbo, yet the spec says dimensions of 14""x14"" (small).And then is says ""styles vary"".So, they want me to buy something that is of unknown size and unknown material."
3,Not As Shown,"I ordered 2 sets of these jumbo shades for my boyfriend and my car. We live in Arizona, so it gets toasty in the summer. I decided to go with the Jumbo shades, because I bought normal sized shades in the past and they were too small.These shades do the trick. They're not that hard to fold people. I've read a lot of complaints about how you can't get them to fold down. Grab the corner and twist until it starts to fold into itself, wiggle it around some, and slide the elastic loop around to hold it in place. Not rocket science, but takes a few times to get the hang of it. Normally I just toss them in my back seat anyway.The thing that annoyed me when I received the shades is that they were different. I bought 2 pair, and one was made out of a vinyl, and the other out of a more ""foil"" like material. I gave the boyfriend the nicer vinyl ones, and i'll put up with the crinkley foil ones, but if you're going to sell a product, please list it as shown or add a selection option."
4,Neat,"Works pretty well. It's easy to fold and blocks the light out. Helps with keeping the heat out, but not completely. All in all, I'm satisfied with this product."
1,Broke after second use,The second time I used this window shade the metal strip that frames the shade broke. I'd be leery buying this.
4,Works as Advertised. Would be Nice if Vehicle Size Chart Was Listed.,"I own a Chevrolet Silverado full size pickup. I figured since it's a large vehicle, I'd need the jumbo sized window shade. I would have been 100% certain if Amazon listed the vehicles that are compatible with this size. When I got the shades, they're actually a bit too big for my truck. But with some overlap in the middle, I made them fit. The shades definitely make a difference. It's summer in Dallas with 100+ degree days every day. Without the shades, I could barely get in my vehicle without something burning me. And it would take quite a while for the AC to cool off the cab of my truck. With the shades up, it's much cooler and it doesn't take much time for my AC to cool off the inside. For $11, you can't go wrong."
3,auto shades,"these fit my car window much better than what I purchased before. what I got a few months back had suction cups on it to hold it to the window but they did not work at all. I was very frustrated. I wish these would fold back down a bit easier. but if you take the time, they do fold down.but if I am in a hurry, I pitch them over into the back seat.years ago I had a set that opened like an umbrella sort of and when fully open, they stayed that way till you needed to close them up. they were even called Brella shades. they folded back down instantly and were wonderful but I have not found anything like them again. If you have anything like that I would be pleased to know of it.thanksDebbie"
1,Thin as paper,This sunshade is thin as paper. I have had it for a few weeks now and it hasn't ripped yet but I know that it will soon. I am looking for a different one.
1,One broke the first day I used them.,"I used these 1 day, and when I took them off the windshield and tried to fold one, the thin metal frame broke. I'm returning it."
4,Good for what it's used for,"I bought this as a gift for my fiancé (he drives a 2009 Honda Civic) and it works fairly well. It fits in the giant windshield that the Civic has, although you do have to use the sun visors to keep it in place.All in all it's a good purchase and most importantly he loves it."
1,broke after a few uses,"I should have listened to the warning I saw in another review. The same problem happened to me. The metal band punctured the fabric one of the first few times I folded it, and now I have a nice long, sharp piece of metal sticking out. I have to be very careful to not scratch the car (or poke my eye!) while deploying or folding. It's also more difficult to fold now because the metal ring no longer maintains a fixed length. These are junk, stay away! I knew I should have just bought a set at Walmart so I could at least return them if this happened."
3,Needs fewer words on each page.,"My daughter who will be two next month, would not sit through the entire book. Actually after 3 pages she loses interest. They are too many words on each page."
4,A very different story,This 1991 movie Wizard of Oz: Danger in a Strange land is good but the story is not like the book or movie. On this VHS there is two storys one is about Glinda looseing her powers and the Wizard has lost his memory. And it is up to Dorothy and her friends to stop the Wicked Witch of the West from rewriting the History of Oz. The 2nd story is about The Day that music died which is a very strange story about Mistros baton. Overall the movie deserves 4 stars.
1,Book review,"Extremely self-serving and somewhat amateurish autobiography. Denigrated good people who helped his destitute widowed mother provide for her large family in order to build himself in importance.A bureaucrat who accepted the position of Secretary of Education, a Department that President Reagan had committed to abolish, and then worked diligently to undercut the President and preserve this destructive Department."
1,The guy who transfered this to DVD?,"Maybe the most God-Awfull Video to DVD Transfer I've ever seen.While the video quality may be terrible, it's great compared to the sound. The sound is so bad, you cant watch this all the way through.You cant hear the instruments at all!!!! All you hear is Vocals, literally!!!What should have been an incredible document of a pioneering Punk band turns out to be a collossil mess.At least we still have the music."
4,A Good DVD Of A Great Band,"This dvd gets a bad rep, and I honestly dont see why, The picture quality is extremely good for an 80s punk show, Remember folks this was a Black Flag show not a Pink Floyd show, So anytime you go to watch a punk rock show on dvd that was from the 80s you cant really expect perfect picture quality, But the picture quality on this dvd is not bad at all, Its actually quite good, And the sound isnt bad either, Sure Henry Rollins vocals out power the instruments but I would rather have vocals out power the instruments instead of the other way around, Even though the vocals out power the instruments a lil bit you can still tell exactly what songs they are playing and hear them well, If you are looking to buy this dvd dont listen to all of the negative reviews, Buy it, Its a great performance by the mighty Black Flag so what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a true Black Flag fan do yourself a favor and buy this."
1,SORRY....,"sorry to say,but BLACK FLAG sucked after DAMAGED(and that didnt suck ONLY because a lot of the material on it had been around for a while BEFORE henry rollins joined).rollins thought himself a rock star even back in 1984.gimme a break......"
2,Terrible sound quality,"It could have been so much better with good audio. It's a vintage Black Flag performance with Hank on vocals, but it sounds like it was recorded with one mic, the one Henry sings into. You hear the music, then when he sings you hear nothing but the vocals. The sound is so bad it's painful to sit through."
2,Too bad...,"It's a real bummer that they had to mess up the sound on this DVD of this awesome band. Henry is way too loud and you can't hear Greg and Kira at all!Another bummer is that they cut out the time in between songs, when the band interacts with the crowd. So you can't really call it a whole concert but just a bunch of cut up song's put together. The set arrangement could have been totally different and you wouldn't even know it.On the up side: The video quality is good and you are actually watching Black Flag perform live!On behalf of the sound and editing: it is truly a shame. Especially since live Black Flag performances on tape/DVD are so rare. Oh well..."
4,great show - bad sound,this is a great documentation of black flag in the 84' line-up. only downer is it seems they recorded the sound from the mixing board - meaning the vocals are jacked over the instruments which were probably much more evened with the vox in the live performance.
2,Cheaper quality,I was disappointed in this purchase. I have used Rubbermaid for years and up to this purchase products maintained quality. This drainer was made cheaply. Thickness to make it tough enough to last is no longer there and drainer is smaller than my last LARGE dish drainer. This one fit inside the old one. Rubbermaid not everyone uses dish washers and there is still a need for a quality dish drainer. I'm disappointed and will look at other manufactures for my next replacement.
5,Missed a step,"Ordered the wrong one, my bad. It's okay I may need it for a puter that I run across in the future for an extra one or something. Good Shipping. Thank You"
1,"1/2"" Clear Flexible Plastic tubing $50.75 per foot","This company's price for this product as advertised is clearly outrageous: $50.75 per foot for 1 foot of 1/2"" clear flexible plastic tubing (also adds a $6.05 shipping charge for a product that weighs 1.6 ounces). I previously ordered the product at a price of $1.79 per foot. Get your act together or pull this product off the Amazaon web site."
5,Great book,The final book in this series. A great end to a great story. Really nice culmination of the overall plot. Really enjoyed the characters and the storyline.
4,Kill the Shogun (Samurai Mysteries),"Good reading, I look forward to more in the series. I particularly like the historical and cultural insights. Even more would be better."
5,Great trilogy,"I really like this trilogy, so of course you have to get a copy of the other two books in the series. It is something I listen to again and again every so often.Nothing makes the time on the road go by better for me than a good audio book. For something like this that is only available in cassette I use a cable to connect the cassette player out to my computer in and then use a program Total Recorder to save it to a mp3. Even audio books on CD are ripped to mp3, because it is just so much more convenient to use mp3."
3,It's an alrite book.,It's an alrite book....nothing really special. It's an okay buy if u want to buy it...
4,IAs cool as cool gets,"""I can see by the hole in your head - that you want to be friends - you're the right one baby... "" Are you kidding me?That has got to be one,if not THE, greatest single line in rock-n-roll history.Everything about these dudes is unusual and cool.In a class by themselves.Wow!"
4,There is no such thing as bad MM.,"Dopes to Infinity is not their best album, in fact, it may be their least best. I say that because it is an awesome cd, but when compared to ""Powertrip"", ""Spine of God"", ""Superjudge"", and ""Monolithic Baby!"", it doesn't quite stack up. It is more along the lines of ""God Says No"", where you really dig it (especially compared to most other bands), but there is just a certain something missing. There are some awesome songs on here, like their first big hit ""Negasonic Teenage Warhead"", ""Look to Your Orb..."" and ""Dead Xmas"". If you are fan, you must add this to your collection. If you are new to MM, then I'd start with ""Powertrip"", as that is their most well-known and successful cd, and the easiest to get into."
4,"It's totally ""Dope"".","One thing is for sure, once I got into ""Monster Magnet"", I wished I had done so sooner, and I'm suprised they're not better known. It's pretty much the sound of what every rebel-rocker wants: monster psychedelic riffs, that's equal doses of 70's classic rock, and 90's stoner rock. Not everything is turned up to 11, there's a few melodic tracks as well, but overall it's pretty heavy. ""Negasonic Teenage Warhead"" is the ""hit"" here, but the rest is just as awesome. Anyone with a liking for ""Kyuss/QOTSA/Soundgarden"" should totally dig this."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this album on the strength of ""Negasonic Teenage Warhead"" which I think kicks majorbutt!! However after listening to the whole album, nothing else even comes close to the energyof that song. If you are looking for more of the same, you too, may be disappointed. I'm not astoner, so maybe I am missing something in this music. I was able to get this through the Amazonmarketplace for a couple of bucks, so I just think of it as the purchase of a really long CDsingle :)."
3,MINOR PROBLEMS,"BINDING WAS DRY ROTTED AND CAME UNCGLUED UPON FIRST OPENING, I KEPT IT BECAUSE I KNEW KEITH AND WANTED THE BOOK"
5,Great book,"This is a great book. It details the life and times of a real man's man. It highlights his integrity and his straight shooting, to the point statements about many situations he faced. Today's world could learn from the thought that bad people should be afraid of good people. Those terms are not contradictory."
5,Finally!,"ive been looking for this dvd for mother forever...thank you Jesusthis one of her favorite docs, i remember when i was younger this used to come on on regular cable. its so powerful and life changing!and the singing is out of this world...this going to be her christmas gift!"
3,History of the Greats; Gospel,"The DvD and Cd will put you in the mind of devotion and worship. It help me to focus on the positive things of life and helps me to know where i have come from, and to know those that have paveth the way."
2,"This is a one song soundtrack, unfortunately.","Bryan Adams is good and the Mexican tunes are great, but let's be honest: this is a single not a soundtrack. The best song by far is the Mexican version of ""Have you ever..."", but it is a paltry two minutes long and clipped short at the end. Come on folks, what's the deal? Was the CD running out of space or something, or did Bryan A. not want to be upstaged? I was very disappointed and cannot recommend this soundtrack/single!"
3,Repetitive --Too much of a good thing,"Beautifully performed music from the motion picture, but unfortunately the repeating melody line gets hammered in too often, so it makes it difficult listening to the entire CD in one sitting. You will find yourself afterwards stuck constantly humming ""Tell me have you ever...really loved...a woman."" And if you're NOT a fan of the Bryan Adams pop ballad, it's pretty frustrating."
5,one song soundtrack? I don't think this is Titanic buddy!,"This album is full of pure and beautiful spanish and mexican music played with an acoustic guitar full of catchy melodic hooks and the beautifully written ballad Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman which was a monster hit in 1995. The rest of the album is nothing like that though it's a musical score of the movie soundtrack, it's not a bunch of tracks from pop artists, you'll have to check out waiting to exhale, another successful movie soundtrack of 1996 for that. If any soundtrack is a one song one, it's Titanic cause honestly what else is good on that soundtrack other than the overplayed my heart will go on?"
4,"Bryan Adams aside, gorgeous spanish melodies, don't miss","I bought this after seeing the movie, at times the music was the best part. The spanish version of the Bryan Adams title track is to be played over and over. There are a couple places where the music is just filler from movie moments but nontheless engaging. Imagine Flaminco dancers, ladies in tight red dresses, roses scenting the air, Sangria... This is a perfect candelight dinner, evening drive, bubble bath choice."
2,its ok,Its ok but wat really makes me upset is selena quintanilla Perez sang songs for this album but was not released on album when it should've been I understand she died but its not right to leave it out.I recommend u watch the movie to hear her sing in Spanish
4,A wonderful listening experience.,"I've never seen this film, maybe never will, and I didn't buy this because of the Bryan Adams song (although I've got nothing against the man or the song).I simply bought this based on a review I read at Filmtracks dot com- and I am not disappointed.I've listened to it about five times now, always with my headphones while down at the boat docks, and it really just gets better each time (I didn't load the pop song onto my player, just the score music).A wonderful pseudo-latin beach vibe, very romantic and melodic.This is such perfect sea-side relaxation music, the album cover should have palm trees in the sunset on it!"
5,I love the first song,"I love the movie it is soo good and the song ""have you ever"" is soo good its worth buying the whole CD!!!!"
2,poor craftsmanship,"This lamp is poorly put together, probably from people who earns less than $1 a day, or by someone who really don't care how things should go together.Not worth nearly the money advertised."
3,A collection that just doesn't seem to work together,"I like the Edgar Broughton Band - they're an under appreciated psychedelic/progressive band from the days of balck lights, incense and recreational illegal substances. They have some very fine albums - Oora, their self-titled CD, and Sing, Brother Sing. Any of these by itself is a really trip, but somehow, taking elements and trying to piecde together a collection such as this just didn't work for me. It loses the overall effect that was there with the individual albums. You might actually be better off making up your own collection.I find the very first track - the title track - irritating and out of sync with much of the remaining tracks.Frankly, if you like the Edgar Broughton Band, I think you may disappointed with this - I was."
5,source was excellent,"source was excellent, on time and the product as representedThis was my first purchase on line and a good experience."
1,Doesn't work out of the box,"I recently bought this tool along with two others, just when I thought I had 1 of the 3 tools not working, guess what this makes it 2 of 3 tools not working."
5,Great Product/Great Deal,DEWALT DW368 Heavy Duty 7-1/4-Inch Lightweight Circular Saw. This Circular Saw is fantastic. I purchased his to replace my 16 year old B and D. I began using it immediately and notice a significant difference between the B and D and Dewalt. The saw is has quick releases for easy and quick adjuctments. The blade protector retracts easily and allows you to saw with one hand without having to manually retract the protector. I have been enjoying the Dewalt DW368 for the past month.
3,Supplier problem,"I bought the saw 'used'. The saw itself appeared to be new and unused, but it was missing 4 parts (blade, washer, retaining bolt, wrench). I bought replacements for those and it now works great."
2,Therapy had only one great moment...,"Therapy? had their great moment with Nurse. This was, and still is, one of the best albums ever made in the punk rock dept. Other albums, like Infernal Love and Troublegum,looked to the other side of the atlantic.This C.D is no more than basic heavy metal sound. Not for me Thank you very much."
4,"a great beginning, keep an eye on caspers","I came across ""the blessed"" quite by accident but wanted to read more from this author. This 1st book shows great promise from a writer with a wonderful and unique voice. Found newer short stories in literary magazines which are really superb. This is definitely an author to watch out for. I was so suprised by ""quertyman"" or whoever that reviewer was that I looked up his other reviews, they were also 1's... Don't miss this author due to that review. I think we may see things from Caspers on the order of other great storytellers like O'Conner or Munro"
5,For those who love the circus...,"Under the Big Top has rekindled my love for the circus. With an amazing blend of describing his season with the circus and the back stories of the others working to put on the show, Bruce Feiler provides an engaging and exciting account of circus life. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and can't wait to go see the circus when it comes to town!"
4,Under The Big Top by Burce Feiler,"A very eye-opening book about the circus, must read for anyone who is thinking about heading that direction. This book gives you a view of the Circus from behind the curtain, after that show is over and the cheering stops."
5,Vicarious Escape,"You don't have to run away to join the circus; Bruce Feiler's done it for you, and has written a wonderful account of what the inner life of the circus is all about. He discovers a unique subculture and lives the adventure by participating as a clown. I've enjoyed Feiler's Walking The Bible and Abraham; here is lighter fare that is pure pleasure reading."
4,Under the Big Top: A Season With The Circus,"An interesting ramble with a non circus person who learns to be a clown and along the way, learns what being with a 'show' really means.Lots of insights that we outsiders will never see, and a peek into some that are gone forever. Not like, Water for Elephants, but the view from a May Wine character on aworld he couldn't have anticipated."
5,Just loved it...,This is a fascinating and touching book that helps to inform the non-circus world about the lives of those on the show in many different capacities. Highly recommended.
5,great inside story,"this is a nice book that tells you first hand about the ""inside"" of a circus.The author participates ""for real"" and tells you about his experience.Being a writer helps to get a very readable and enjoyable story that is not over romanticed nor over dramatic or over... . If you like the circus world, you will really enjoy this !"
5,A Maddeningly Outrageous Young Lady,"All society was scandalized by the shocking behavior of Miss Allegra Herington. It was common knowledge that her distant cousin, wealthy, handsome, impeccably groomed Sir Derek Herington, had offered this virtually impoverished young lady his much-sought-after hand in marriage-and Allegra refused. But still more unlikely events soon followed. Who but an obviously mad girl would desert the delights of Regency London for the dangers and intrigues of Brussels on the eve of Waterloo? Who but Allegra would shamefully neglect her own interests while arranging a most splendid match for her younger sister? And who but the captivating Allegra would once again find herself in the arms of Sir Derek-as pride warred with passion, and true love chose a most unlikely route of conquest...A well-written and enjoyable book! Clare Darcy is a a sensitive storyteller who always touches readers' hearts."""
2,Disappointed,"I've read several of Ms Darcy's books and this is the first one I haven't liked. First off, the book is boring - there is not enough of the clever conversation that I know Ms Darcy is capable of. And the Heroine (Allegra) is not just dull, she is rather stupid and WAY too full of pride. I did like her sister though and wish the book had been about Hilary instead! Sir Derek was so arrogant that I was rooting for Allegra to fall in love with someone else. But what I disliked most about this book was that Allegra and Sir Derek spent almost the entire book misunderstanding and fighting with each other. I enjoy it when the main characters banter with each other but I hate it when the banter crosses the line into sniping as it does in this book. Not reccommended."
2,Living with Pamela Stephenson,"I thought I was going to read about Billy and his adventures. However, for a book supposedly about the Big Yin, three quarters of it is about his wife and her adventures. When she does talk about Billy's childhood, its impossible to believe anyone could remember such detail. I found myself skimming through the 38 pages devoted to HER trip to India while Billy was home nursing a bad back. There is also too much detail about everything BUT Billy, such as the history of their home in Candacraig that dated back to the 1500's, flyfishing, the South Pacific. Pamela's first book ""Billy"" was great but I found the sequel to be a big disappointment."
4,Fan Letter,I am a huge Billy Connolly fan & really enjoed Pamela's first book & looked forward to this. I have not read the book yet but enjoyed the audio very much. Pamela is an excellent writer & shares great insight into a very funny man. My only complaint is that the audio is abridged. As in the first book I'm sure much is left out that I would like to listen to often.
4,"Entertaining look at a ""year in the life"" of Billy Connolly","Arguably one of Scotland's most famous exports, Billy Connolly's life and adventures have been well documented in print, in his stage acts, and television shows created for British audiences. While not so well known in the US, he has been a huge star in Great Britain for decades.This book, lovingly written by his wife Pamela Stephenson, seems to take Billy's familiarity for granted. Rather oddly constructed for a biography, Bravemouth gives an interesting insight into their marriage and into Billy's evolving relationship with himself as he ages, cleans-up, and ""embraces"" Hollywood. The book focuses a great deal on their trips and in particular on Billy's extravagant 60th birthday party.More a ""year in the life of"" rather than a true biography, this is a witty and winning look at the irreverent Billy Connolly. Full of color photos, this will be a welcome read for any fan."
4,Good Headphones,I love these headphones I have owned 2 pairs of these over 3 years and I must say the things that make these headphones worthwhile is comfort and lightweight. I recently purchased a ax360 headphones from triton for lots more MONEY and these little cheap headphones beat them every time. I been known to play games for 3+ hours a time an don't even notice these headphones on. the 3d sound quality is good i can hear things around me no problem and it had good bass for a year but atill sounds good. the vinyl coating on the headphones cushion starts to crumble away but even then there was a nice cloth under it which is even more comfortable.
4,oh yeah it's that great,love the routing bits. i have checked out a lot of routing bits for cheaper on line and they cannot be matched for quality.
5,* TOP NOTCH ESSENTIAL SCRATCH *,"This is a beautiful and lovingly assembled set of Black Ark material from Pressure Sounds. Every song comes with a version, and many of the songs and dubs are not only rare, but are prime examples of the musical synergy which was in full fruition in the heydays of the Ark. Easily on par with Pressure Sound's excellent Voodooism, any Lee Perry fan who wishes to look themselves in the mirror needs either to purchase this set, or give the asking price to charity. There are no other options for righteous living."
4,My Little Margie DVD Collection,This disc was everything I hoped for with excellent transfer quality. It actually looks better than when it originally aired on television. If you are a fan of this show you will love this dvd.al
3,Remember?,"Probably not accuratly. My mom noticed it in the library and said ""Oh BOY! Let's watch it!"" 10 minutes into the first episode, she remarked ""Hmmm....this was a pretty lousy show"".Now...maybe...but not back then---OK - Compared to Lucy this show comes up way short...anything probably would. Still, it's interesting. The sitcom in it's infancy. The ""hooks"" - Margie's rolling-her-tongue sound, Vern's direct-to-camera double takes (left over from the Roach silent film days). Mr. Honeywell's voice.Me? I'm glad I got it. Just for the amazing opening and closing theme music.BUT...if you want good early TV....try Topper."
2,Dopey 50's sit com,"This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the ""chewing up the scenery"" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else."
1,Racism,"Some may not know that My Little Margie is shown weekly on Sky Angel. As one who loves old black and white sitcoms, I was very upset at the racism in My Little Margie. In the series other races (at least 3 that I counted) are spoken down to and shown to be ignorant. I would suggest you spend your money on I Love Lucy or other shows that are not as racist."
4,Underrated 1950's Sitcom,"The picture quality DVD release of this DVD is stunning. These episodes are public domain, anyone can sell them. VCI is one of many budget companies taking advantage of this, and their release features some of the best picture quality I've ever seen of a 1950's sitcom, almost as clear as ""I Love Lucy"". The sound is stunning for a 1950's sitcom too.The show itself is funny, cute and fast-paced, but it's the picture quality which makes this release special."
3,"Some stories were good, some mediocre.","The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, a collection of short stories by Roald Dahl was not one of his best works. Although, some stories, such as The Mildenhall Treasure and The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar were good stories, others were lagging. Some were hard to understand, others just weren't interesting. Some were okay, such as The Swan. Unfortunately, this book never had any consistancy"
3,Bookreview,"I've read the book ""The wonderful story of Henry Sugar and six more"". It's a book containing seven short stories. The longest one is the story about a wonderful person called Henry Sugar, an egoist who whants to change his life and become more like Robin Hood. But in my opinion, the best one is, ""The Swan"", a great story about a kid who whants to survie from two big persons of the same age. You just can't stop reading it. The whole book was ok, but some stories were very boring, others were supricenly good. I'll give the book 3 out of 5, because the book was ok. Personally, I don't like shortstories. I prefer reading novels.Simon Blomqvist"
4,Henry Sugar,I had to read this book for school.. and i have to admit i thought it was gonna be really boring.. it was actually quite good apart from the last 2 stories.........it is worth reading and the actual HENRY SUGAR story is fantastic!!! <333
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The Mildenhall TreasureThis is a non-fiction account of a labourer named Gordon Butcher that uncovered a large quantity of Roman treasure in a field that he was ploughing for a farmer named only as Ford.Lucky BreakThis is a non-fictional account, form. It discusses the events in his life that lead him to becoming a writer.A Piece of CakeThis is an autobiographical account of Dahl's time as a fighter pilot in World War II.The Boy Who Talked with AnimalsThe Hitch-hikerThe SwanThe Wonderful Story of Henry SugarTurtle talking saves the day.3 out of 5Thief good with thumbs.3 out of 5Tying on bits of bird and then shooting him won't turn a kid into Icarus.4 out of 5Reformed type becomes yogi pontoon philanthropist.5 out of 5"
3,funny,One day he did'nt want his fortune and used it to start an orphange. I liked it because it was funny.
4,Quite Okay!,"I have read a number of Roald Dahl's story. I find that this collection of short stories is quite funny, but when comparing with other Roald Dahl's books, this book seems not as interesting as the others. But if you really want to read, I recommended the first story THE BOY WHOO TALKED WITH ANIMALS since I think this is the most funny one."
1,Pokemon Origami,While my son loved the characters he had a hard time folding them. Kids with more experience under them would like this book more I think.
5,Pokemon Origami,Pokemon Origami is great. Now I can instead of drawing pokemon I can create pokemon out of origami
1,Not Sterling Silver,The ring looked just like the photo on Amazon; however I was very upset when I wore it because my finger turned black where the ring touched my skin. This ring was not sterling silver.
3,Not to happy!,"I am having a difficult time putting the juicer together( unable to get the cover over the screen) There is also a great deal of foam after juicing, thought this juicer was suppose to be better than others r/t to this issue.I am thinking of trying to contact the seller r/t to issues not addressed in the info. booklet, any ideas on how to follow thru ? I am considering returning the juicer, however after much research found this one to be one of the best?Very frustrated!"
3,Hot juice,This Juicer leaves alot of pulp before it can get to the grinder area. so alot of fruit is left unjuiced. Heat is also a problem since it seems to build up the more Fruits and veggies you juice. So the juice is no longer fresh and cool when you drink it. It is HOT. So Im hoping the enzymes are still okay also. I wish I had bought another juicer for that amount of money.
2,Design and performance problems,"I just received this juicer, and have tried juicing two batches of mixed juice. It's pesky to clean, difficult to attach the ""body"" to the cutter shaft (dealing with the screen is very awkward), the juice comes out slowly, and the screen clogs to the point where you have to stop and clean it out before you're done with your batch. And also one thing I'm finding--it takes a whole lotta produce to make a couple small glasses of juice. Juicing is not a cheap proposition. This morning I juiced 6 carrots, 3 beets, one apple, and two big leaves of chard, to get about 8 or so ounces of juice. Plus there was a whole lot of foam which I couldn't blend back into the juice. Champion is supposed to be first and foremost, but I think I'm going to look around at different models. Unfortunately there's no way to test out various juicers before making your choice."
3,Not the most efficient,"My wife has a need for a good juicer. She had one, but I thought this one would be better. No, it isn't. Her other one gets more juice out of the vegetables, does it quicker, and it cleans up faster. I now have the champ on craigslist for resale. I'm going to take a beating on this one!"
1,"Disappointing Juicer, Don't Buy It","I had this juicer for slightly less than a year. I noticed that my juices started getting hot after using it. Also, it's not very good with leafy greens (kale, broccoli) because it overheats. Lastly, it's very heavy and clunky and after a while smells of oil. I have never been so disappointed over a product such as this one."
3,"More powerful, more messy than cheaper juicer.","I 'upgraded' to the Champion after burning out the motor on my Jack V. juicing leafy greens. It was a decision based on all of the raving I'd seen and heard. I knew about masticating juicers already because I own a small travel juicer that is hand powered. I loved my little travel juicer for it's ease of juice and cleaning.The Champion, however, is a mess. When juicing, I would estimate that 65% of the juiced produce will exit as designed, through the end. 30% of it will remain in the main body assembly for you to scrub it out. 5% of it will somehow squeeze onto the main motor assembly, where you have to wipe it of the metal rod that holds the blade. With my previous centrifugal (Jack V.) and masticating juicers, I've never had so much cleaning to do.The juice, i should say, is fine. 30% more frothy than my Jack V.Nut butters- make that mess ratio 50% (which is desirable in this case)/40%/10%Smoothies- 60% (desirable)/30%/10%"
5,a high quality masticating juicer,"This Champion juicer is the first juicer I've ever owned and I am mightily impressed. First of all, everything about it just exudes a sense of quality and sturdy design. The machine is very heavy, and the plastics used seem durable. The machine is moderately loud, perhaps the same volume as a garbage disposal ... and much more quiet than a blender. It seems to juice efficiently since the pulp produced is not especially wet. Certainly juicy, hard fruits (apples, pears) and hard and/or juicy veggies (celery, carrots) are handled very well.My only minor complaint has to do with the juicer's assembly. I always need a couple minutes to put it all together because I'm always fiddling with the screen. Perhaps I am the one who is a bit clumsy but I do feel this one area could have been designed a bit better.Bottom line: expensive, but it seems this is a case of where you get what you pay for. Recommended."
1,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed after two and a half years of enjoying the product to find out when the moter failed unexpectedly one day that the product was not covered by a 10 year warranty, despite a deceiving company advertisment. The company will not honor their warranty. I am truly disappointed to be writing this review as my expirence with the product was positive until this point."
5,Juicer Supreme,"We decided 2 years ago to juice for health. I spent hours online investigating juicers and realized that the cheap ones wouldn't last. Anyway, we figured a few hundred dollars investing in your well being isn't a big deal. After reading about the industrial quality of the Champion, we made the move and have never regretted it. Besides being efficient and relatively quiet, it blasts through any type of veggie or fruit, with ease. And we have timed the clean-up at 3 minutes or less. Simply rinse, soak and wipe. Just be careful with the cutting part. The only downside as with any commercial-grade appliance, is the weight. We keep it on the counter for 2 reasons. It's heavy and hard to store and if we keep it out, we are more likely to use it. So get juicing, just for the health of it with a true Champion. Cheers!"
2,"Cleans up quickly, juices efficiently","Pros: quick, easy clean up. Easy to feed pulp back through to get as much juice as possibleCons: juicer gets hot and heats the juice (not good for maintaining nutritional content)blades were dull within 8 months, Champion replaced themSee my review about the Breville - blows the Champion away"
1,Poor choice for juicing,Juicer leaks out juice when used with blank for grinding only for use with a pulp press for final juice extraction. Juicing is also very slow compared with centrifugal juicers.
3,Chute too narrow,"biggest complaint - the feed tube is too narrow, you have to cut up everything! Even my carrots wouldn't fit in the chute!"
1,I created an account just to review this item!!,"Seriously?If youre going to drop this kind of money in hopes of finding a reliable juicer, I suggest you purchase it from a store where you can return it after you tried it. Because one you try it out a couple of times, I can guarantee you'll want your money back. It gets dull fast, and its AWFUL, just awful, for leafy greens. And I also read in one review that someone had the clean up timed to 3 minutes. Why did they feel a need to time the process? Because it is an arguably LONG and irritating process. If you get some sort of routine down, it can be done faster- but there is no denying that as an every day task, cleaning up this monster = TIME SUCKAGE! STAY AWAY!"
1,Not good for simply making good juice..,"The champion juicer I have produces juice with way too much foam.I am into juicing everyday and don't want to deal with 2 steps (don't tell me to use a filter/screen to press the juice to remove foam). I am going back to my old juicer (like juice man Jr.) way nicer juice. (Again don't tell me about heat.. .to kill the enzymes you need to get to 110 or 120, and I am not worried.. If you want to get all ""hippie"" then think about the oxidation caused by the foam from the champion...)Please keep in mind I only want simple juice out of my juicer. Juice from vegetables and fruits. I'm doing things like making nut butter."
3,It's ok,"I'm a Spongebob fan, I got it for my collection. Initially, the first one was already busted open when I got it. Amazon usually packs well so I was surprised it was cracked and leaking when I got it. Sent it back, no issues.Got the new one and was not too impressed other than it is a Spongebob toy. The little triangle that is inside with words on it is barely visible more than 50% of the time. It's as if it's not heavy enough. Most times it ends on the edge of the triangle and you're reduced to twisting and turning the thing so you can see what you can get. When it does show, you can barely read it because it's not up against the window enough to push all the blue away??Not too thouroughly impressed. Barely any of the toys I've bought have been durable or reliable from Nickelodeon. I'm almost to the point of not buying their items anymore."
3,An Incredilbe Surprise for an History Illiterate,"This was an interesting story about an era in American and Soviet history about which I and most people are unaware, told from the perspective of two people who lived the story. It's a warm, human story of a young idealistic couple traveling from the American depression to a new country, Karelia, a Russian province, to create the perfect society and their disillusionment when the Stalin regime dashed any prospect of achieving that dream."
5,nifty book,"the guy who wrote the book was the brother of one of my aunt's very dear friends. she let me borrow it a few weeks ago and i got a big kick out of it because i'd heard stories of the people involved, specifically the sister, irja. i'd recommend it to anyone who likes hearing stories from relatives. this wasn't written like a technical history book. it was written like your grandparents are sitting around one day giving you their history."
5,WOW!!!!,"If you love or even LIKE Sting, this is a BREATHTAKING album! Great relaxing bath or wind-down music! This is an ABSOLUTE MUST for Sting fans! Don't pass this up!!!!"
2,Muszac,"While there are a few lovely instrumental interludes on this album, I would have to classify this as ""elevator"" music, with a little too much pan flute for my liking."
2,It was okay...not as great as I had hoped.,"The only thing that gave me goosebumps on this Cd is Sting's vocals on ""Mad About You"" and ""Why Should I Cry For You?"". I expected that. However, a lot of the CD sounded like restaurant music. Did I think about the ocean? Hardly. Was it worth it? No. I should've bought another Sting CD instead."
2,Pretty stereotypical,"2 1/2Sting gets to let out all of his new age urges in doing the soundtrack for this underwater doc. Including a few of his vocal-based songs from previous solo work to wet the appetite, unfortunately the background-coasting, generic Caribbean vibe which pervades a majority of instrumentals makes the title an unworthy purchase."
4,Beautiful mood music of the sea.,"I bought this CD after seeing the IMAX movie, ""The Living Sea."" I am not a Sting fan but I like what he did here. For anyone who loves the sea, this is a great CD to just sit back and imagine the ocean. A great relaxer, especially, St. Agnes."
4,Good compilation of Sting classics,"I thought this CD was a very well done compilation of Sting hits. Although the body of the songs remain untouched (I do not believe he re-recorded any new music for this collection), a wonderful job of adding additional mood and enhancement tones was created. Often it is hard to notice where the new material ends and the original songs begin. Overall, a very good effort is made to utilize fantastic music while adding new flavor to achieve an overall ocean theme. END"
4,Rich and informative - the best way to experience the setting from home,"Although this documentary exhibits many of the expected, sometimes trite nuances of a soft television documentary, it truly is an informative and entertaining depiction of Irish pubs and related historical settings, with strong emphasis on history of Irish literary masters. In so many cases one could argue that you could get more/better information from a book, but you just can't get the atmosphere from a book like you can in a well-crafted video documentary like this one. The only thing that could be better, perhaps, would be to venture to Ireland and experience these historic places for yourself, which is something this documentary makes very, very tempting."
3,"starts out good, goes downhill","another book borrowed from my friend... i started off liking this book, then it just got confusing and boring. i forgot to finish it and just skimmed the very end now. i was a couple chapters away, and nothing could have completed the book to my satisfaction, or kept my attention on it. it did get me thinking a lot about reincarnation, so thats why i initially liked it, because it does make you think. maybe he should re write it and do some edits?"
3,Entertaining and interesting until------,"the climax. Totally ridiculous ending that makes NO SENSE in light of what preceeded it. The main character's climactic actions are hinted at once in the middle of the book, but the motivation behind them are never fully explained. I really liked this book up to the last four pages, but I could have written a far, far better ending, absolutely no lie!"
2,Save your money,"I bought this book based on someone's recommendation and the positive reviews here. I was intrigued because of my interest in the subject of reincarnation. I have yet to come across a good piece of fiction on the subject... this book certainly isn't what I was looking for!Grammatical errors, inconsistencies in the text (such as the spelling of the cat's name), and a general aura of disbelief on the part of nearly every character in the book made this a tiring read. No conclusions were drawn by the end, and the author's handling of the ending was dismal.I can think of a bunch of things that would have made this book more interesting and easier to read. Unfortunately, the author didn't. Save your money."
4,Part one...an excellent beginning,"Mr. KMD weaves a wonderful cautionary tale of the near future. There is hard neuroscience mixed with speculative spiritualism, but the bottom line is living, loveable characters who adapt and grow. And the ending is a shocker...but the very next page is a sneak peek into the sequel (""Fragments""). By the time this series is over (feels like at least three, maybe four books in all), Michael will have turned the whole universe upside down. If you read it only to see a dark vision of where we shouldn't go in his setting, you should read it. But there is also an orchard full of ideas, some hard science, others ehtereal, to be savored. I can hardly wait for book 2. This novel is a triumph; albeit act one. Buy and read if you like sci-fi at all, and for sure if you are either a) of open-minded spritual grounding, but especially if b) you think you know how the universe works (because you have a wake up call...)"
4,Documenting a great experience,"One of the my most memorable and entrancing evenings of live entertainment was seeing - and participating in - De La Guarda in New York City. This DVD helps keep those memories alive, and I was delighted to be able to buy it. The video quality is a little less than one might hope for, and someone who was not at one of their performances might not get the whole concept, but for me, this DVD is a keeper."
2,THE COVER IS THE BEST PART OF THIS VIDEO,"The beginning leads you to believe she has had a relationship with a fat man and her half brother. Once she leaves Germany, in a feable search for her mother and love, the movie begins to gain the viewers interest. In San Francisco she hits the lesbian scene and is introduced to her first lesbian strip show....that in itself was amusing at best.Long story short, I am not sure what the actual point of this movie was."
2,Nice design poorly implemented,I've purchased two of these as I really wanted it to work. Both broke after only a few uses.
4,Cool Pocket Toothbrush,"This is an excellent toothbrush. It can be a little difficult to insert the toothpaste at times, but other than that it works as advertised."
1,Cheap!!,"I was thrilled to have the OHSO Marko Pocket Toothbrush! The first couple days worked great! However I noticed the toothpaste began to harden inside the OHSO, making it harder to use. Please note I made sure the clean the product after every use! I didn't have it a week before the ""Chrome"" began falling off the handle. After the toothpaste began hardening, I cleaned the inside thinking it was the toothpaste. However after trying another toothpaste, I had the same result. The toothbrush began to fall apart and was inoperable. This toothbrush product is extremely cheap and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I highly recommend searching for a different brand of pocket toothbrushes because this one is garbage."
1,Worst product ever!,"I was amazed by this and I even bought spare brushes cause I thought it would last, but when I received it I was surprised by how fragile this item is. It's built from cheap chinese plastic and it broke after the first use. Now it is useless. Definitely does not worth the money."
2,Something you don't need,"It's a little too big to be called compact and it looks too much like a personal pleasure device to be carried in a purse. For now, my wife will continue carrying a folding toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste. Save your money for something that really fills a need."
1,unhappy,"The silver-plated Waterford frame was defective, and I had already thrown away the receipt so had to keep it. This was the very first Amazon purchase with which I was dissatisfied."
5,still holding up after 10 years of use!,"Seriously. I've had this umbrella for about 10 years, and it's the only one I use. I was in Austin, and now in NYC and it's still holding up. So lightweight I can carry it with me always and not even mind. I must say, I am careful when the wind is strong. If the wind starts to carry it away, I don't fight it....sort of like driving into the skid when you hit ice. I let it go a bit back before pulling it down low. So far, so good. A few years ago I did use a bit of black thread and some elbow grease to reattach all the little spots that hold the fabric to the frame."
3,Big Fan,"I am a big fan of the movie so for me this game was just an extension of that. If you want to immerse yourself in the world of ""The Thing"" then I suggest you buy this. If you are just looking for a great game this is not going to be the ""one""."
4,Cool Game!,When I first played this game I totally hated it.But when suddenly I rented it yesterday I was playing it non-stop till 12:30 midnight!Buy this game!
4,"Good Graphics, Nice Plot, But has faults",The Thing is a game that is great with graphics/storyline but poor in other areas. You can't save where you want. Some parts in the game are way too hard to get through. It would be a 5 star game if it had a format to save anyplace you want and perhaps a difficulty setting. All in all the game was ok. The price is ok too. Don't pay over 20 dollars for it.
5,(The Thing) blood gore and more!,"I like games that scare the ... out of you and still give you one heck of a time. The Thing has got everything a good gamer likes. Blood, gore, guns, aliens, other people, and plenty of gameplay. What more could you ask for out of a game? This game totally rules."
5,Great game,"For an original xbox title (yes it plays on the 360) this game is a winner. One of the earliest games to incorporate a.i. & your actions during the game will determine how much your team trusts you. Let them do the dirty work during a fight, they wont trust you nearly as much. Give a team member a better weapon & their trust improves. Takes place after the John Carpenter movie."
3,3.5 Stars,"A decent enough game. But I don't really think the ads really reflect the true nature of the gameplay. I thought there would be so much more to dealing with the possibility of an ""infected"" team member. I also don't really buy into the story angle that the game takes. I am a huge fan of the film, and I was hoping it would be modeled a little closer to that storyline. Instead, huge liberties were taken by Vivendi Universal. The Graphics are stellar, and the gameplay is really well done. I suppose I just wish I enjoyed the games storyline a little more."
1,the only game thats worse for the x-box is azurik,"This game could have been really fun if everything about it weren't done wrong. the graphics are poor, the animation is incredibly jerky, and so far as i can tell there is ablolutely no story when the movie had an incredible story, but the worst aspect of this game is it is so hard that its more frustrating than fun to play. oh and watch out for the terrible camera which does NOT let you see anything but what is directly in front of you. And the X-box version is supposed to be the best version of this game, so be careful of getting this poor excuse for a game on any system unless you are considering purchasing azurik."
5,Xbox only hope,This game truly showes the potential of the xbox. It's interactive gameplay and story will do for the xbox what Metal Gear did for Play station
1,This game sucks,The graphics on this game are horrible. I bought this game with high hopes that it would make me appreciate x-box. Boy was i wrong. The game [is bad]. I wouldn't even rent it. The game play is just plane bad. If you want a good game buy halo for that is the only game that x-box has that is good. X-box has really let me down. I should have bought a ps2
2,Missed Greatness,"Billy Mann's skill as a songwriter cannot make up for his soul obsession, which mars this otherwise interesting album. Without the `groovy' studio perfection Mann is actually quite good, as proved by an excellent hard to find unplugged version of `Killed By A Flower' which blows away anything on this album."
5,One of the best!!!,"The pinnacle of movie serials. Republic, Frances Gifford, Whitney and English, says it all. A MASTERPIECE AMONG MOVIE SERIALS!"
3,"Imus, ye led me astray.","I read this book because Linda Fairstein is often on Imus and I'm an Imus addict. I generally don't say this out loud, but most women authors in this genre get too involved with what shoes the characters are wearing, what wine they are drinking, if their hair's messy, etc., and Fairstein falls into the trap.There were two different stories going on here and the rapist story, though it was the initial storyline of the book, sorta just faded when the Poe business started. It was like Ms. Fairstein all of a sudden remembered it, and hurried up and ended it...stupidly.Since Imus had her on for every book, I thought there must be something there...but there isn't. I read this book off and on for several weeks, mostly when I didn't have anything else to read.Check it out from the library and don't spend your money."
4,Back to Nature,"7th in the Alexandra Cooper series, ADA in charge of the Sex Crimes unit in NYC, stumbles on a cold case in the house where Poe lived - a skeleton buried behind a brick wall - buried alive, at one time. The case abruptly becomes hot when it is tied to a current murder. Mercer & Chapman are back investigating by Alex's side, this time venturing to the Bronx Botanical Gardens and another of Poe's historic residences. Coincidentally, Poe shows up on Final Jeopardy, Chapman and Alex's favorite competition. I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did The Bone Vault, which was 5th, but Fairstein is definitely building some new relationships and developing/changing some of the old ones."
5,Fairstein's Best Ever,"I confess I'm a great fan of the Alex Cooper series because Fairstein, a former prosecutor, combines her vast knowledge of the criminal justice system with appealing characters, great plots, and a breezy, fast-paced style. In this book she outdoes herself. She reveals a hidden story about Edgar Allen Poe and gives us a glimpse into one of the great New York landmarks -- also a Fairstein specialty. It's fun, informative and truly frightening, worthy of the master to whom it pays homage. Be prepared to stay up all night."
3,Not As Good As Others,"This book wasn't as good as the others. The Edgar Allan Poe parts were interesting but that's not why I bought the book. I bought it because of the way Ms. Fairstein puts together mysteries and her leads solve them. I loved how she usually has them interact both professionally and personally. But in this book it felt stilted and forced. I felt she had so many mysteries going on at once that she had to tie together that she didn't really do any of them justice. I was just disappointed in this book. Granted I haven't read all her books but the ones I have read are better than this. This one was jumbled up and wasn't logical. Alex Cooper has usually held her own but in this book, it was like she was a bumbling idiot. Just sad for this strong, smart character. I hope the series get better than this. Can't wait to give another a try."
3,Maybe its me?,"Fairstein's latest book is so basic that I had to double check to make sure it wasn't her debut book that they now decided to release.Although the basic premise might have been interesting (a dead body found in Poe's house), you find out very quickly that this has nothing to do with Poe. I believe this book would certainly have been far better had she decided to include him.While this book is not horrible, its just more of the same that Fairstein has been turning out. Absolutely nothing new here and the story just is not that interesting. Its as though she does not know what to write anymore so she keeps using bits and pieces of her other stories.Or maybe I am just tired of reading the works of major authors and having the feeling they just ""called it in"".Lately, I have been enjoying unknowns alot more than our ""bestseller"" authors."
3,Poe is the best Part,As many other reviewers this is my first Linda Fairstein mystery. To start on the positive the description of the Bronx expecially the Botanical Gardens and Poe Park were interesting. I also learned a great deal about Poe. ( Poe seems in vogue with a new book by Matthew Pearl on Poe)The characters seem to busy being clever to be interesting. Chapman's romance may be more meaningful to readers who know the series but all I thought it did was show they were deep and did not add to the story.On the whole it is a diverting book but there are many better series.
3,Great plot - so so characters,"First, this is my first book by Linda Fairstein. Maybe, if I had read the eariler ones, I may have had a better insight on the characters. As it was when Mike Chapman received a devasting blow, it lacked any pull. I also found the relationship between Alex, Mike and Mercer hard to understand. They are suppose to be close yet they really don't spend time together outside of work unless it's eating at really odd times.The story line less the personal drama of Mike Chapman is very interesting. Interesting facts about Poe and New York add zest to the book.Overall, a good summer beach read."
1,Poor introduction to Fairstein,"This is the first Fairstein novel I've read and it was a poor introduction to the author. The characters are boring and her attempts to interweave the motivations of the protagonists fail miserably. She is trying so hard to lecture the reader about minutiae about Poe that she fails to interest us in her plot. Fairstein tries to capture our attention in the beginning with tales of the Silk Stocking Rapist but his capture at the end is almost an afterthought. I had the feeling she suddenly remembered that was how she began the book and ""Oh ... I better find an end to it"". The Cooper character may have some substainence in other books but not in this one. Perhaps, if you are familiar with the characters from other books in the series, you will be more forgiving of the lack of character development. However, if you want to get involved with the characters, this is not a stand alone book."
2,Repetitive material for the bedridden,"Entombed is the second novel that I have purchased by Linda Fairstein. Regrettably, I cannot distinguish this novel from the first one I read. The detective is the same - as she is the main character - but it seems to me that every office, city description, conversation, reaction, plot etc is identical. It is a cookie-cutter novelette at its worst and I experienced an unnerving sense of deja-vu after about 90 pages, thinking that I must have picked up the first novel by mistake and had started reading it again. Needless to say that by page 120 I gave up, convinced that there was minmial benefit to be gained from further reading. One saving grace though is that I purchased the book as a used copy through Amazon, so it only cost me about $5 in total."
3,Easy read could have been better,I thought the story was a bit too complex - too many murders or attempted murders entwined in one book. I have read 6 of Ms. Fairstein's books and this one was not as good as the rest.
1,Scotts Boro's unimpressed,"What a monumental bore of a writer. Same old same old. The Princess heroine dillydallying all over Manhattan. Shallow, superficial nonsense."
4,Not for the ADHD mind,"Greetings,I'm with the majority of the other people, it's a lot of blah-blah. I kept scanning forward to get back into the swing of the conversation. But when you do that you end up missing stuff. Linda Fairstein is still a winner in my book, that's why I gave it an extra star...(I'm currently working on about 500 reviews, I order pretty much everything from Amazon but I pretty much never review. So I'm going through this years orders to catch up, and try and give back to the system. [...]... My goal is to get into the Vine program)"
4,The Raven Society,"Edgar Allen Poe has played a prominent role in several recent mysteries, and he inspires a murderer in Entombed. The Silk Stocking Strangler, who terrorized NYC four years ago but was never caught, returns to the scene of his crimes, and this time around, ADA Alex Cooper is determined to collar him. On the heels of the new strangling, the skeleton of a young woman is discovered bricked up in the basement of a house once occupied by Poe. The body count increases, and it's soon apparent that there are two murderers on the loose. The investigations take Alex and her colorful team to the Bronx, where the Botanic Gardens and Poe Cottage provide the atmosphere for the chase, and Ms Fairstein does her usual dexterous job in weaving factual and forensic information into her plot. The Alexandra Cooper novels are smart, fast paced, and skillfully written, and Entombed is no exception; following her cases always presents an interesting and satisfying challenge."
4,Great Entertainment,"I bought this game for my 2 sons, ages 10 and 12. It occupied the entire cross country flight we recently took. Mom and dad even took turns playing...Lots of variety in games and skill levels and great graphics. Best yet, you only need one game and a link for multiple players to play against each other. It took a few times playing to understand the rules as the written rules are a bit tough to understand, but we figured it out quickly and really enjoyed the games. Much more intelligent than many of the advance games out there and you can even learn some new game techniques...Highly recommended..."
4,Wow!,"Great game! I would especially recomend it to anyone who is traveling. The olny problem is learning how to play. If you don't already know how to play a game, you won't learn by this. Other than that, there really isn't anything else wrong with it. I took it on a trip recently, and it kept me busy the whole time. So if you want fun, buy this!"
4,"Good value for the money, but kind of hard...","I picked this up on recommendations from others that this title was worth the bang for the buck. Well, even on easy level I found myself blindly frustrated by its ability to pull off tactics in chess or connect four that left me wondering if I was even playing the game correctly.For the amount of money you pay though, its hard to beat the fact that you get multiple games in one package (check out other titles for the GBA that have the same kinds of games, at higher prices, or only offer one of the games included in this cart, for the same price). The graphics and sound are good as well, although others here have mentioned the glitches that sometimes occur.If you really like a challenge and like the kind of parlor games offered by Ultimate Brain Games, I'd recommend that you try it out."
4,"Good competitor, though not so illustrative","It is a good set of games, with a good competition level, but... it makes its moves so fast you can't track them comfortably; eg. playing backgammon requires all your attention because the time between your last move and the game's dice throw and its movements takes less than half a second! you never see its dice combination on screen! Same for the rest of the games."
5,Great product,"A great product for those who want an entertaining departure from games with shooting, driving, animals, and other creatures. Each of the 8 games is well done and challenging. My son and I play head2head all the time.Good work, Telegames!"
1,Game Boy Advance on DS Lite,Did not like this at all. The graphics were really bad on my Ds Lite. Would not recommend.
3,"Good, but flawed.","A pretty nice little multi-game cartridge. Chess and checkers are the main draw and sport a rather good AI and are clear and good looking graphics-wise. The ""Sea-Battle"" (*cough* Battleship *cough*) is rather clever in it's approach and animation.The drawbacks are the dominoes game, which just scrolls through your available bone positions -- no strategy involved -- so it may as well be computer vs. computer. The Mahjong game is not competition based, it's just a solitare version. Dumb."
1,Okay Game....,but not what I was expecting. Guess I'm really anxious for the Ultimate Card Games to come out and thought Brain Games would be close to that...
2,very dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed in this game. The games listed are some of my favorites. First let me say battleship is FUN. It always has been, however the game does have problems with the two flagship games in the line-up. Chess and checkers. The problem with checkers is that it forces moves, if you can jump the computer you have to jump the computer even if it sets you up for a triple jump thats the move you have to make. Now when the game your playing is a strategy game and you not allowed to strategize there is a serious problem. Chess has a lot of move glitches, i've had pawns move diagonally when there is no piece to attack and pawns move vertically and capture pieces to there right or left, lots of problems. As for the rest of the games you get what you expect to get nothing more and nothing less"
2,Disappointed..........,"This game has a good variety of puzzles and grown-up games. However, it is misleading for the maker of the game to say ""works on Nintendo DS."" While this is true - it does work - it only works on the top screen, making it exceedingly difficult to see the game. If you have a Nintendo DS and not a Game Boy Advanced, wait for the DS version, so that you have a game that plays on both screens, and is stylus-active. I'm sorry I didn't wait."
3,Skin Doctors Capillary Clear,I have been using the Capillary Clear for a little over 6 weeks now. I have followed the instructions ie 2 x per day cleaning my face then applying a hot flannel for a few moments before massaging the product in. The really severe redness of my cheeks and my nose seems to have been reduced (although I still apply makeup when I go out)I will be placing an order for a 2nd jar.For anyone who is interested I previously tried laser treatment and apart from it being extremely painful (almost intolerable for me) I think it made the problem worse.
5,skin doctors,"This product actually does what it says. I have been using it for 2 years and my red cheeks are no longer red. I will keep using it, if I stop it seems the problem comes back. I am very satisfied."
3,An issue of our times.,"A little long but a great read. Believing in God is the internal struggle of why things happen and whose hands that is in. The right to die is a thing that we all need to think about, whether it's right for us or not."
3,Someone else noticed too.,"I'm glad someone else noticed the music on this cd are the same basic tracks as on Ronnie Aldrich's Christmas cd ""Jingle Bells"". Ronnie's playing is more enjoyable on these songs. I do like Roger Williams, just not so much on this cd."
5,Roger Williams Golden Christmas,"Even thou this only has 10 tracks this is a must have in your Christmas Music Library.All 10 of these songs by Roger Williams are with full Orchestra done by The Romantic Strings and Roger Williams playing the piano.Every song is laden with heavy lush strings.This is the Christmas Music that use to get played on beautiful music stations.I enjoy this cd every year during the holiday season.I also recommend other music artist like Percy Faith,Mantovani,The Living Strings,Jackie Gleason,The 101 Strings,James Last and others.All of these ez artist also have Christmas albums."
1,Bad copy of the original arragments from Ronnie Aldrich LP,"In 1964 Ronnie Aldrich released in London Phase 4 Stereo his Christmas album, in a spectacular arragments, sound and interpretation of 12 beautiful themes.I like the music of R. Williams, but this is a copy (bad copy) from that beautiful LP of R. Aldrich. The sound in this CD is bad (as in mostly CD of R. Williams, with only exception of ""His greatest perfomences"")."
1,Brainless,"This book had a catchy title and I picked it up. It was a great read from the start but was so twisted near the end.The main character Roy seemed so clueless. The author's constant uses of ""What?"", ""I don't know what you mean"", and Roy's constant state of bewilderment was almost laughable. He had no clue of what people were saying around him. In fact, a whole page is dedicated to someone trying to clue him in. For example when Roy was told his whole department was let go he didn't get it. Even though all of the furniture, computers, and cubes were gone Roy was still wondering when he was going to start his new job as the boss of a department that was missing. The conference call with NY was classic, Roy ripping his shirt off because he couldn't breathe... correction Curtis's shirt, because Roy forgot he was wearing a UGA Football T-Shirt. The ending made no sense. I should write a book if they publish this junk."
4,Misunderstood Novel,"This is certainly not a typical Abrahams suspense novel. I feel it is more of a mainsteam novel with strong satirical and historical overtones. It addresses rifts in our country that have never healed, and how gaming gets out of hand. I found the novel highly charged and highly symbolic, and quite underrated. If you're looking for suspense, read another of Abraham's novels; if you're looking for a a thoughtful and subtle read which works through suggestion, this just might be your cup of campfire coffee."
3,BRING ON THE DIXIE CUPS,"Abrahams LAST OF THE DIXIE HEROES starts out pretty well, offering a glimpse into the disintegration of Roy Hill's life. With his wife and son living with a computer dork named Barry, Roy still has a good job and is geared up for a promotion. We never really understand what happened to his marriage, suffice to say his wife is a hypocritic flirt and his son, Rhett, an insufferable wimp. Roy ends up participating in one of those Civil War re-enactments and from there the story goes into a mind-boggling maze of ambiguities and unbelievable twists and turns. This might have worked if there had been some element of true suspense; however, Abrahams pokes along, losing character and plot development and an ending that comes out of nowhere.Abrahams, the good writer he is, should have left this one alone.NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Brian's On the Mark,"""Last of the Dixie Heroes"" was a great read for most of the book, but went absolutely haywire in the last several chapters. After finishing it, I was glad that I had borrowed it from the library instead of paying for it. Perhaps Mr. Abrahams had something profoundly surreal in mind; if so, he missed the mark by a country mile. See Mr. English's reveiw for more details... I couldn't agree more."
5,Our pastors are supposed to be shepherds guiding us in the paths that are right,"and many are not doing that. They're hiding behind excuses like ""we're not supposed to get involved in politics"". That is not true. Politics is just living in society. You can't be lazy and shirk your duties as a citizen. Look what has happened to our country since the 60s when America's citizens bought the lies of ""Progressives"". Look at the data charts in David Barton's, ""Our Godley Heritage"". Shocking...yet it makes perfect sense. Our pastors will be held accountable one day by God for shirking their responsibility. And we, as a people, will be held responsible for not learning what is available right under our nose."
5,David Barton is my favorite history writer,"David always does an excellant job on anything he does. So thankful to have him speaking, showing and writing about our ""God Given"" constitution and all about our country. The real truth is needed in schools, government and everywhere."
1,Difficult and disappointing,"The plot sounded great from the cover, but the book itself was quite disappointing. Bunn's writing style is too choppy - sort of like reading John Wu in prose.I forced myself to finish the first three chapters to see if it would get better or at least more interesting, but it did not. I figure that if an author can't hook me into the story in less than the first 30 pages, there are better things I could be doing with my time - like watching the grass grow."
5,"Furyo, or not to Furyo??","The French release ""FURYO - Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"" has the same track listing as the other non Furyo version put out by the same record company ""Milan Records"" is the cd cover worth the extra money??What ever you choose, this is is an excellent soundtrack by Ryuichi Sakamoto."
4,"Relaxing, smooth and suttle.","Get this album if you want to relax to the sound of beautifull music combined with a beautifull voice. He is not a full blown tenor, but he sings with ease and his interpretations are excellent."
2,Histrionic,"He's good when he sings in a whisper, but the voice shreds when he starts shouting. Does include a vocal version of the title theme from Out Of Africa, which induced me to buy the album when I heard it being played in a CD shop. But the rest of the album is disappointing. Does anyone need ANOTHER cover version of Unchained Melody or (even worse) Bridge Over Troubled Waters? Or Amazing Grace (which he does well when singing in a subdued manner but spoils it when he lets rip).Would also like more biographical notes on him. Apparently his mother (or someone relation at least!) is Celestrina Casapietra, an opera singer (but I could not find anything on her on the net. She duets with Bjorn on the Out of Africa tune."
1,Little Fern's,Seller cancelled transaction. Item was not availabe afterall. Upset that it was listed when not available. Purchased book for class assignment and did not have it. vERY DISAPPOINTED.Rated book a 1 star (comp. made me rate something) but I really can't rate it sine I never read it
4,Filtered water bottle,"I really appreciate this product, and the piece of mind it gives me. I know it's designed for campers, but I use it at work. I was really tired of buying bottles of water, but being pregnant I just couldn't trust the tap water. With the water in D.C. being found to contain all sorts of chemicals and pharmaceutical, it's nice to have a way to get decent water when I'm out. The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is (1) because of the large filter, it doesn't hold as much water as I'd like, (2) it's pricey and (3) it tends to leak sometimes when I squeeze it. Overall, I'm glad to have it, but probably should have bought the next model up with a larger reservoir."
3,If we had to work this hard for soda pop we'd all be skinny,"The product seems to do what it claims, but after sucking and squeezing like crazy to get the water out I ditched it for a brita pitcher. If I go kayaking and have limited space I'll take this along, but only if I can't take my regular wilderness filter."
5,a modern-rock classic,"Here's a classic example of the '90s ""alternative"" genre, complete with soaring vocals, driving guitars, and tight songwriting. All tracks on this CD are very good. My only complaint is that Dishwalla seem too tentative, too reluctant to go ahead and jam on some of these awesome riffs they wrote. There is often an inopportune tempo change or a reduction in intensity at the wrong point in the song (""Haze,"" ""Charlie Brown's Parents"") but perhaps the band overcame their inhibitions on their second CD, which I will definitely buy. Anyway, think Pearl Jam vocals over Catherine Wheel riffs--can't be bad."
5,More to Count on than just Blue Cars...,"An excellent CD! When I first heard it, I thought it pretty much sounded like everything else out there, but listening to it more and more made me realize how original their sound is. From the satire of ""Pretty Babies"" and the humor of ""Miss Emma Peel"" to the mysteriousness of ""Moisture"" and ""Date With Sarah"" (hidden track), this disc has it all. The whole band works together perfectly with each other to give the songs life. I'm looking forward very much to the follow up."
3,Pet Your Friends,"I wasn't really into it when I first listened. I knew some other various Dishwalla songs (which I really liked) and of course I heard counting blue cars and loved it so I decided to pick this up. Anyway, as I was saying the first time I played it nothing but the song ""give"" stood out to me. After a few listens though I'd say it is pretty decent, and it gets better the more times you hear it. Some of the other songs I like are haze and Charlie Brown's parents. I would probably give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,Surprisingly strong,"It took me a while to warm up to this cd, but when pay attention to the lyrics, they're great. Good vocals, and good production. Pleasantly suprised - this is a serious album."
2,This CD didn't live up to its singles.,"After hearing both versions of ""Counting Blue Cars"" and LOVING them, I took a chance and bought the CD. Sorry to say, it was quite disapppointing. Lots of ""filler"" and after listening to it a few times, I got rid of it. Thank goodness for used CD stores that take trade-ins! Hope to hear something consistently better from Dishwalla in the future."
1,you guys stink,this cd stinks i don't know you guys got into this business but this cd blows hairy go nad i hate blue cars almost as much as i hate you guys
5,pet treat pouch,"love it, use it all the time when walking my dogs and around the house comfortable and light on the waist"
5,Great product,Item is very well made and I can already tell it will last for many training sessions to come. The product is very high quality and has great features.
3,Very durable but the hinged pouch does not stay open,The fabric is durable and I like the zipper in the back for keys and front small pouch for bags and clicker. The down side is the hinges do not keep the pouch open and the opening is very small.
2,HInge broke after 3 weeks,The hinge broke after three weeks of use. I really liked the pouch other than that.
3,Belt loop too small,"I am a male who is 6'2"" and 250lbs who wears a 40-42 jeans. The belt circumference is too small for my waist. Such a shame since it's not a bad product. They should make the belt longer so thinner people can just cut it shorter to fit. The belt clip included is not an option for me since it is thin plastic and I usually wear untucked t shirts when training or walking my dog."
3,Pugs choice,"Easy and quick to put on but large on a woman's frame. The top edge is not bendable. It holds various treats in different pockets, or your car keys. I'm using it daily."
4,I'm here for my second!,"I think this is a great pouch. The fact that you can use the included belt or the clip makes it really convenient for hands-free training. I've used mine nearly every day for about 11 months. The pouch still functions to hold treats, but the brackets on each side have both come off within the last couple months and the velcro on the front pocket is useless and has been since about the first month. It was definitely worth the price and I'm here to buy another one as a replacement."
5,Excellent addition to our puppy training program,"The combination purchase of the Premier Pet Treat Pouch and the Easy Walker has been a God send in the training of our Doberdoodle puppy. He is growing fast and the use of the Easy Walker and the Premier Pet Treat Pouch together has made training so much easier. Our puppy now weighs as much as my 11 year old daughter and she feels so much more in control having the harness on and easy access to treats. Also,with the extra pouches for a cell phone and clean up bags she is more willing and confident taking him for walks. I would recommend the purchase of both of these products to anyone who wants to train an energetic puppy with more ease and control."
5,Very convenient treat pouch,This treat pouch does everything I needed. It's easy to open and close with one hand. It's big enough that I can put a tennis ball in if needed. The belt cinches in small enough to fit. It's perfect.
4,Very helpful during training,"If you are training a dog, you need something like this. This product seems to be made of good quality material and the 'spring' open/close feature works well. I also love that my cell phone fits in the extra pocket with a velcro closing. I am giving it four stars instead of five because the clip is made of plastic and not very functional, you will need to use the belt option or it won't stay on. With the clip, anytime I leaned over the whole pocket would fall off. But at least the treats stay in because the closing mechanism is secure. If you don't mind using the belt with it, I highly recommend the treat pouch."
5,The best treat pouch ever,"I've been training my dogs for years using treats for positive rewards. I always had a problem with treats spilling out of my treat pouch, but with this pouch, I've never had a problem. It opens easily, yet snaps shut securely. I highly recommend this product."
2,Regret this purchase.,"Hard to keep open. Not as flexible and easy to use as I expected. Also, very large, is bulky if you are out walking."
2,NOT the right product,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift and was not pleased when it arrived. I assumed I would get the product that was pictured and described [...]. Instead I got this bait bag [...]. If I had wanted a bait bag that looked as cheap as the one I got I would have ordered it instead of the one I assumed (based on picture and description) I did order. NOT pleased. I have, for myself, the one I wanted to order for a gift. Next to my bag, this one is very cheap looking and feeling. WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN!!"
4,Clip broke after 4 months; great for carrying waste bags,"The plastic clip broke this week, after 4 months of use. I guess I'm okay with that, as I've now found I like the belt feature better. With the clip, the treat bag filled with a couple handfuls of Zuke's Mini treats would kinda pull down my loose yoga pants that I always wear.... oops! So, I much prefer the belt, wish I'd tried it sooner.I use this treat pouch to hold Zuke's Mini treats to reward Zoey for going potty promptly, coming inside when I call her, etc. Most importantly, it holds my waste bag for picking up after Zoey, so I can have both my hands free even if my clothing doesn't have pockets, like the aforementioned yoga pants.The directions for this Premier treat pouch instruct the user to occasionally oil the hinges, which I need to do. The hinges to close the pouch worked smoothly until some rain got on the hinges.... now they're creaky and stiff. So, gotta oil those!"
5,StrongArm earned is name well,"Replaced the original tailgate lift on my Focus Wagon 2002. It was really easy to install and the open the gate and keep it wide open easely! Would definitely buy again,"
2,water shoe,the water shoe is really comfortable but if your looking for protection this may not be the shoe for you. This shoe will not stay on your foot if your looking to kayak and find yourself swimming in some tuff current.
2,Cute but not functional in water,These shoes are adorable but they absolutely do not stay on your foot if you are swimming or walking through deep water. It's a pity because they are adorable.
3,Comfortable,"These shoes are very ccmfortable. A little bit short but since there are no half sizes, the next size would be too large. My feet get really hot in them but for the most part I am happy with my purchase."
2,Over-rated,"Joe Perry is the most over-rated guitar player in rock music. I highly suggest that if you want to listen to some better guitar work then check out Joe Satrini, Wayne Krantiz, Jimi Hendrix, or Stevie Ray Vaughn as they are much better then Mr. Perry. There are some cool blusey tunes on this album, but most of it is just filler material and cheezy guitar hot licking that is way over-rated!"
1,Couldn't save the good stuff for an Aerosmith album?,Excellent guitar...cool riffs in poor songs...just plain weak vocals...Steven's vocals and some better song arrangements could easily have taken advantage of the outstanding guitar.I had to pull the CD out of the player before the album was completed. A huge disappointment considering I bought this because of the Amazon reviews posted immediately after its release....you guys must be in his fan club.Borrow this one from an Aerosmith fan...you can buy mine.
2,could have been great,"This material could have been an incredible Aerosmith album with Steven Tyler on vocals, but becomes very average with Joe Perry's singing. Without question the music itself is strong but the vocal situation is a disappointment."
1,Joe - Let The Music Do The Talkin',"I am a huge Aerosmith fan and it is due in no small part to Joe's guitar talents. However, if you can get through one complete listening of this disk, you are a bigger fan than I. Joe's voice has always been 'thin' at best but coupled with the lyrics he's written for this dog . . . it's just embarrassing. If you never realized how important Steve Tyler is to Aerosmith, listen to the samples that Amazon provides. Love ya Joe, but this is a disk only a mother could love."
1,dissapointing...are you surprised?,"I am a huge Aerosmith fan...even worked on a music video with them..back in 'the day' - even drove Perry and most of the rest back to their hotel - what a treat...even getting yelled at by him (I forgive him...we filmed for 24 hours). After hearing Perry in concert (many a time) performing Red House and his vocal entries on the last Aerosmith cd...told me I should not expect much. He is an okay songwriter...a decent guitar player, but vocalist? Sorry, Joe. He sounds like that guy next door who can play guitar and fiddles around singing songs. NOthing you would want to pay to hear and I am sorry I did! ADDED TO THE REVIEW - some more recent reviews suggest that one buy this and ""ignore the vocals and listen only to the guitars"" - they have a point that the guitar playing is better than the vocals...but to ask someone to shell out $15 and not listen to the bland voice is ludicrous."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've been a Joe perry fan since the early days of Aerosmith and saw the Joe Perry project many times when they were together. The first cd "" let the music do the talking"" was great and I'm sorry to say it has gone downhill from there, culminating with this embarrassment. I really don't know what he is thinking. The vocals are horrendous,except for ""crystal ship"", the lyrics are so cliche' and immature it is beyond belief and the production is bad. There are a couple of musical ideas that are somewhat interesting. I grew up idolizing joe as a guitar player and I expected to hear something that was fresh and imaginitive but that was not to be. The song ""smile at me"" was the final insult. This song is downright pitifull. I'm sorry to say that the king of cool has embarrased himself on this one. I hope his hot sauce isn't this bad. Sorry Joe."
2,is this the god we once knew?,joe perry's solo album..where he's written the lyrics sung the songs OH GOD please say it isn't so? he can't of have done such career suicide could he really? yes he has..man the music rocks great guitar work joe..terrible lyrics and please don't sing ever again and if you're thinking about doing another solo album like this..then think again..team back up with steven tyler and he'll write the lyrics while you write the music and stay the hell away from the microphone get back to being the toxic twins in an well respected band called AEROSMITH
2,"Rap! not rock, not metal.","After reading Amazon reviews I decided to by this CD, Expecting something that would make Rage Against The Machine look like middle-schoolers. What I got was a CD that is 97% rap and 3% rock at best. Only 4 of tracks even feature guitar riffs.The song Whats going on is basicly a flute sequenced track. The song Peace is soft rap / rock. One song is just noise behind a slow drum beat. Eject has some heavy guitar work but is more like dokken or Led Zeppelin heavy, that's as heavy as it gets. Blow away Limp Bizkit? only if it's a soft rock rap contest!!! People like myself from the school of Metallica and Megadeth will find this CD to be a rap CD nothing more. Rockers from the School of Limp Bizkit will find this CD a little on the mellow side. If you like soft / hard Rap with lyrics that tell you to do your own thing then you should love Stacked Up."
5,"I Love It, Total Carnage","I spent an entire day at work driving around town looking for this disk, before I had a computer, you are lucky to have found it so easily, cuz it totally kicks a$$. I can't wait to get the import asylum. Tracks one and four are the best."
4,"Good, but, not great","I'm a big fan of FNM, RHCP, RATM, Mr.Bungle, Infectious Grooves, etc. I expected those styles and levels of music from Senser. But, they're too naive. They just Rap and Rap and keep Rapping, on and on. Moreover their rapping isn't as cool as Mike Patton, Zack De La Rocha, Anthony Kiedis, and even Cyco Muir. In addition, their guitar working is not so special. Nevertheless, Senser are good, though not great. It seems that since I compared them with great bands, which are for me, they're underrated. Despite inferiority to my favorites, they deserve listening."
3,Beware of photography quality,I was looking foward to reading and enjoying the early work of Robert Adams. The essay and photographs work very well together but the cover images are the only ones that are reproduced with any quality. If you compare the tonal range of the inside reproductions with the cover work you will be disappointed. I kept the book because I did enjoy the essay and I collect books by Robert Adams. Too bad the reproductions are so weak.
4,Steam Power Sawmill,First part is a drag to watch (train) but the second part of the sawmill is great. Not bad to watch.
3,Not a bad overview,This book isn't a bad overview of basic MRI fundamentals. I would have liked it better if it had a bit more background in the basic physics involved because I've found that there is a HUGE gap between these basic beginning books and the advanced ones. The beginning ones assume you know nothing and the advanced ones assume you've got a PhD in high energy particle physics.
4,Compact travelling for summer campers,"I love how compact this set it. Instead of packing pots, pans, griddles, etc, everything stacks neatly together and zips up for packing in a small car. It a great spacesaver and stil is big enough to do the job at the campsite. I never have to worry about forgetting a pot or pan for the camp kitchen. I gave it 4/5 stars because I probably won't use the metal plates and plastic forks/knives and because I would have really liked it if they included cooking utensils (large spoon, spatula, large fork) that are suitable to non stick surfaces. Other than that, I got a great price on amazon and treated myself to a nice birthday present."
3,Cute,"This is a cute, cuddly bear, a nice size, and easy to put together. I would have rated it higher, but the fur seems uneven or rubbed off in some places."
4,Makes a great gift,This makes a great gift for anyone. It came exactly as described (except for a minor flaw in the stitching of the toes).
2,They broke,"I must down-grade the rating. I was very pleased with the sound quality, but they broke. I was changing out the foam ear plug when the sound tube broke off even with the body of the earpiece. After it broke, I was trying again to remove the foam plug from the tube, the tube flew into the carpet. If I can find it, I will try to glue it back on without plugging the hole or getting glue into the mechanism, but I do not like my chances.They lasted a number of months, so I will not give the lowest rating, but perhaps I should.UPDATE: I discovered there is a one-year manufacturer warranty. I called Amazon. They could not send me a replacement, but they did give me a shipping label to return the phones for a refund. We will see how that goes. I will report back.UPDATE 2: I sent back the broken phones and Amazon refunded my money."
3,"Sturdy, reasonable sound quality, Made in USA","These are really great as monitors, but only average as regular headphones. The isolation is great, perfect for recording quieter tracks without a click track bleeding in to the recording. I even use them to listen to audiobooks while I mow the law. However, for just listening to music, the sound is...very plain. I know that they're monitors, so they're supposed to give a balanced ""true"" signal, but these sound just a bit washed out."
5,Best travel accessory! Look no further!,"This is my first experience w/ an in-ear monitor - Westone UM1. At first I was skeptical at how much noise isolation this unit could do but to my amazement it was fascinating. I used this IEM during my recent travel overseas and once the music started I was in total awe on the musical detail it provided. My source was the iPhone 4s w/ 320kbps mp3 music files and most of the time a Fiio E6 headphone amp (recommended). I didn't feel I was in an aircraft at all. So if you have not tried an IEM before, I encourage you to do so. I have not tried the comparatively priced Shure but based on my research it was my other choice."
4,Pure sound for reasonable price,I have quite a collection of earphones and I find the Westone UM1 to have superb sound quality compared to most earphones on the market. The sound is clear and crisp. The cords are unique and are tangle resistant. The earphones take some getting use to but with practice that is not terribly detracting. I like the foam seals that you pinch when inserting and swell to make a nice seal. All in all I am quite satisfied with the quality of this product.
3,Decent but could be improved,"See Dennis' review, he nailed it. The black finish is nice and goes well with the mounting location on my Versys. I shimmed it with a bicycle tube and some aluminum sheet cut from a can to mount it to a tube narrower than 7/8"", as there is no room on the Versys's handlebars."
1,Limited at Best.,"If you have a crotch-rocket with narrow handle-bars, there's no place to put these. The diameter of the clamp is way too small to fit anywhere else (like the arms that hold the passenger foot-pegs in place) and the screws are so short that you have no option of putting it anywhere other than the handle-bars. This is a waste of money and a totally useless product."
4,The Rockingdown Mystery - Great story!,"I am very pleased with the service of Amazon.com and the condition of the product I received.I have been an Enid blyton collector since 1979. She is a great children novelist and her stories teaches good community values.My first collection of over 200 Enid Blytons was lost, it was devastating. I started a new collection from 2002 and now I have 46 Enid Blytons. It was very difficult to find The Rockingdown Mystery, it hasn't been published for 3 years.[...]Amazon does amazing work!Sincerely,Stella Evelyne TeshaGreen Waters Foundation[...]"
5,Judge Jules does it again!,IF you're into trance....this is a must in your collection. Judge Jules knows how to keep the party going. The 1st cd starts off fast and it doesn't slow down. The 2nd cd does the same. It was hard to pull the cds out ot the player I have at home. Judege Jules has pulled away from Paul oakenfold by going back to the basic and that is making the audience dance. If you don't have this cd you better get it.
1,POX,"I really loved Euphoria CD and bought this thinking it was going to be more fantastic music. But oh was I was wrong. I listened to it once before putting it into the bottom drawer, probably never to be listened to again."
5,Outstanding Writing,"Simon, the Duke of Sutton, is blinded in the Napoleonic Wars, and shuts himself up in his London home. Judith Ware is a poor relation to gentry, forced to become a governess. Mutual friends arrange for Judith to work as a reader for Simon, and of course they fall in love. Although this is an older book (published 1990) and the setup sounds trite, it plays out in a very realistic way that feels far more historically accurate than most romances. The author is clearly influenced by Jane Austen. Although she mentions Judith reading Emma, the real influence here is Pride and Prejudice. Imagine a blind version of Mr. Darcy. Yes, it's that good. No purple prose, no miracle cure, no embarrassingly awful sex scenes, just good solid writing. Highly recommended."
1,BUYER BEWARE - NOT DUAL LINK DVI,All of these cheap Cables Unlimited branded dual-link DVI cables are NOT dual link. The pins look like the cable _should be dual link_ but the cable itself is wired for single-link only.The 5-star reviews for this product are all for low-resolution monitors that only require single link.BUYER BEWARE
1,"Buyer Beware of MarginMart, Inc.","I purchased two of these cables from Amazon marketplace seller MarginMart, Inc and they are not what is described on the product page. The cables I received had dual link connectors but they were attached to single link cable. They therefore do not provide dual-link bandwidth and would not work with my 2560x1600 display. I find this a deceptive trade practice on the part of MarginMart, Inc, by only using single link cable the average person who is not using a very high resolution display would not notice they have not received what they paid for. I have now been unable to use my display for several days while I wait on a replacement cable. Shame on MarginMart, Inc."
1,"Bad, just Bad.",It is an hdmi cable with dual link DVI headers. If you are looking for a resolution of 2560 x 1440 or 2560 x 1600 DO NOT BUY THIS. This cable can not handle those resolutions. These people are very very sneaky and I won't be buying anything else from them.
5,It works.,"It works fine, and it doesn't feel terribly cheap or breakable. I've been using it for a couple months now."
5,Our Lord Prays For His Own,Our Lord Prays For His Own is absolutely the best book I have ever read next to the Bible.
4,This book touched on a vital issue,"It's a good book because altogether it says we should let go of our big dreams and take advantage of what we have.It's true that we should set aside our big dreams,BUT we should set small goals to work up to our big dreams.Fanny should not have set aside her big dreams,but if the mayor's son had already married,I think she should marry Heber."
3,The Book was ok,Girls need to not be so picky. It was a great and fun story. Fanny is a fun and good role model. Young women would probably enjoy this but I thought it was ok.
4,A Book of Wonders,"""Fanny's Dream"" is a very fantastic book! This book includes one damsel in distress, one independent girl, two princes, and a fairy godmother. I guarantee that all ages will find this book interesting and some what funny. This tells about 2 girls: One named Cinderella who is very timid and sad, and another named Cinder Edna who is independent and straight forward. I suggest you read this book and find out the wonders of it!"
4,Look Beyond the Children's Story,"Fanny's Dream (Picture Puffins)A wonderfully illustrated story that has a powerful moral. We often have big dreams and wishes that are beyond the realm of reality. My Mom used to warn me, 'be careful what you pray for'. Fanny had a dream to marry a prince and have a life of ease and luxury, waited on hand and foot. But the reality was that she married a simple farmer, just like her. They had a good marriage full of happiness, but also a life of hard work and the occasional disaster. Although she did not marry the tall, dark, handsome prince, she felt that her life was 'close enough, close enough'. I purchased a book for each of my 6 children as a Christmas gift, and labeled them 'Marriage Manual'."
2,not enough fanny,"As a 12 year old, I feel let down by this book. It wasn't grown up enough for me - the front cover promise hidden delights, and the title teased, but the contents left me feeling limp and unexcited.If only the writer had opened it up a little, and let fanny stretch herself more, it would have been a 5 star rating."
5,azjannie,I love children's literature and was raised being exposed to the very best. My sister introduced me to this book and I have since bought many copies to give as gifts. This book is my very favorite. I love the message. I love the characters. I love Fanny's self esteem. Read it--you'll love it too! Go Fanny!
5,This book has something for everyone!,"A mom's dream come true-a book with a good message that my daughter(5) adores! It is so refreshing in this world of barbies and brittanys, to find a heroine who has a better than 'fairytale' ending. Really a terrific story as well."
2,Give it up?,"Fanny's Dream is a good book. But I don't think I would suggest this book to anyone. I liked the story because it was humorous, with a girl with a good life. What I didn't like was that she completely gave up her dream (after an hour of thinking about it). And then when Franny's godmother does show up, she turned her down and told her husband, Heber. He ruined the book when he didn't believe her. It was a good book, but no, I'd rather keep my dreams."
4,A memorable performance by Katherine Hepburn,"Each character has played the assigned role in a charming manner, bringing out the human shortcomings, grief and disappointments."
3,TV version is a pity!,"I had high expectation before viewing it. However, I regreted that the directer changed the arrangment of the play. The setting of this tv version is TOO REALISTIC, outcrowding the poetric imagination of audience induced by the spacious, dreamy, superrealistic setting of theatre versions."
4,AN EXCELLENT VERSION FOR A CLASSIC OF AMERICAN DRAMA,"Among the several existing versions for cinema and TV, this is one of my favourite, thanks to Mrs. Hepburn's and the direction. Sober in form, emotionally contained and quite faithful to the original play, this version achieves the poetry and melancholy required. All the interpreters are very good but Mrs Hepburn is simply stunning. I don't give it 5 stars because I think that the DVD deserves remastering."
4,one of the best but not the best version!,"This is the best version available. I say that because the best by far was the 1950 version that featured Miss Jane Wyman and Mr. Kirk Douglas. Its unfortunate that that version isnt available to the public to veiw. I saw it years ago in Chicago on the old late late show. Jane Wyman's preformance as Laura was moving and unforgetable. So much so that I refuse to buy any other version available. so if you have also seen the 1950 version, speak up and maybe we can get it released for purchase."
1,Very displeased!,"I got this ""DVD"" as a gift for Christmas. I love the play and the movie The Glass Menagerie, so I was excited to finally own it...But the ""DVD"" didn't work in 2 different DVD players, a PS3, or an XBOX. I tried to see if it would work in every appliance that I own, and every time I would try the appliances, they would tell me ""Wrong Region."" I dont even know what that means. It even says on the movie case that it is a DVD. Buying this was a waste of time and money, The whole situation is very upsetting to me."
1,I'm about to commit heresy,"As much as I've always loved Katherine Hepburn, I simply couldn't watch this for more than 10 minutes. First, she was too much of a Yankee to portray a southerner convincingly, and second... her voice had deteriorated so much by the time this film was made that it was actually painful to listen to her."
1,Depends on your preference...,"I had to read the book/play for a college literature class. Things just arn't as good when they are 'required'. I personally did not like this, but again, it depends on what you like. This followed actually very closely with the written play. It was a good way to get a better visual idea of what was going on."
4,"It's a good tie out, but not my favorite.",The pros is that it's a good quality cable and easy to use (I guess they all are). However the rotating function on the tie out doesn't keep it from tangling like other's I've used.
1,Junk!,My 50 lb. beagle was able to snap the end off of the the cable the 1st time he ran and pulled on the cable.
1,Thinner cable and no spring on tie out,"I've bought this item before, It then was a thicker cable and came with all steel connecting clasp to cable. It is now a thinner cable, pot metal connector and no spring. I won't order this item again. It says large dogs but should be labeled now medium sized ones. Your decreased quality has lost my business."
3,"Part excellent, part bad","Wood knows too much about his subject, which leads him to tacitly assume knowledge a beginner doesn't have. This book has much to help a beginner, but it's organization is awful. He provides a nominal step-by-step approach from activating starter to baking, but vagueness precludes following it. For example, at one point he instructs users to ""place the culture in a bowl and add 2 C warm water."" But he gives no clue to how much of ""the culture"" and his instructions could make it from 2 to 4 or more cups of thick liquid."
3,deceiving,"this book is smaller than i expected. but full of good information and some great old time recipes, a few modern pictures would be nice."
4,Outstanding insight on a variety of topics,"This book was a refreshing alternative to mainstream media coverage of world issues. If your tired of reading the same old ""rabble"" in the newspaper or watching it on the nightly news, you'll enjoy certainly enjoy this. One can't help but wonder just how out of touch the average citizen is with the true motives behind the decisions made within the corridors of power throughout the world. Mr. Chomsky brings up some good points regarding the economy which just cannot be overlooked. If corporate profits are reaching record levels, wages are stagnant, and social programs are non-existent, then where is all of the money going? Read the book and find out."
1,Disappointing,Not an accurate portrait of their thought; the author writes from a modern bias that permeates the work. I was disappointed.
2,This music was average--no songs to write home about,I expected a version of Twas The Night Before Christmas that was similar to Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians. TWNBC was a disappointment. The other songs on the album are not ones that will be heard in my house at Christmas time.Someone may find this album in their stocking this year.
3,Log bed review - could so easily be 5 star,"This bed is well worth the money. It asssembled well, the instructions were clear and all the necessary nuts & bolts were there along with spares.It has only one let-down and that is that it has only 3 cross frame supports. the mattress sags between them. For the sake of one or two peices of timber it should have a 4 or 5 star rating"
4,Best Deal for the Money,"I spent a lot of time looking for a log bed. This bed is the best deal for your money, and it is solid once put together."
2,Keep looking.....,"This book does have some useful information on benefits of eating right, but some of the emotional philosophy can be a turn off. Yes I am losing weight, not amazing results, but enough to keep me encouraged. The biggest downfall is the recipes. They call for a long list of ingredients which isn't cheap for people on a budget. Plus, only a few recipes are actually good, some are just O.K., and more often than not, just plain awful. Keep your money on this book and keep looking for a better book on vegan eating!"
3,no demonstration,"Mark Johnson is a capable writer, who demonstrates the weaknesses of any moral theory that insists on absolutes. In a redundant manner most of the book is about this weakness. However, didn't we already know this? That absolutes were guidelines, helpful rules of thumb, but not always completely applicable. Still it is a very good review (why I gave it three stars). Yet Johnson does not demonstrate that ""moral imagination"" really gets us anywhere. Is it really any more insightful than the old rules? Johnson takes us up a flight of stairs only to find the door at the top locked."
1,bad quality,"bad quality watch, the watch got humidity inside the case which make crystal foggy. sooooooo you think is from Denmark.....NO? inside some parts are made in china."
2,don't waste your money.,The product is incredibly flimsy and not durable at all. I would rather have my $7 back and risk cutting my fingers again. I feel like this gadget actually makes the job harder.
1,Big Waste of Money,"This flimsy holder makes the job harder. Bagel moves inside holder. Holder moves when trying to cut (it needs a handle, or to be ""nailed-down""). Holding-on to the non-rigid acrylic surface causes knife-slot to collapse, making the knife bind and actually prevents bagel from being cut. It would be a bad item for 99-cents, but for about six-dollars, I'm returning it."
2,Not up to expectations,This product is not sturdy enough to hold a large bagel. This makes cutting the bagel very difficult. The holder would spread even wider when cutting.
2,"Bagel holder, not so good!",This bagel holder just slides on the counter as I am trying to slice it and of course not all bagels fit in it. It is hard to get the thing spread apart in order to cut through the opening in the middle. I went back to just cutting the bagles on the cutting board. Not worth your hard earned money.
1,It didn't even make it through the slicing of one bagel!,"My husband was so excited when his bagel slicer arrived in the mail. Wanting to try it out, he put a bagel in it, and seconds later, I heard, ""Seriously???"". It had cracked right in half, halfway through slicing the first bagel! It was very narrow, not good for accomodating ""normal bagel shop sized bagels"", and since the ones you buy in multi-packs in the supermarket are usually pre-sliced, I have no idea what bagels they thought would fit in it when they were doing their measurements. I highly recommend against buying this unless you feel like wasting your money!!"
3,Okay but needs to be sturdier,The product is capable of holding a very large bagel and good for cutting but it's prone to breakage. Mine snapped in half unfortunately. It would be better if the bagel holder was made out of sturdier plastic or even a metal bagel holder would be ideal.
3,large bagel holder,"The 1st time I used this product I wasn't impressed, cutting the bagel made a rubbing noise but I tried it again and it worked much better. This is a good product and the cost is good."
1,Flimsy Product,Item broke the third time I used it. I don't think it should be made from plastic or they need to change the design.
3,Very Nice!,"We used this for a few months until Christmas, then my parents got us a bagel guillotine which is awesome. Now I'm fat and don't eat bagels. Need a cheap (in expensive) piece of acrylic so you don't cut your finger in a bagel frenzy, This will do the the trick."
3,good product,"I like the product, but it does seem a bit flimsy. I hope it lasts a long time. I use it at work to cut bagels for my students and it saves my fingers from being cut."
1,Don't drop it!,The shotrtest drop will turn this cheap POS into shrapnel. Save your time and temper and just buy one of those knifelike devices from Brooklyn.
5,Basic Background Information,"This is one of the few books I've seen that starts off with a discussion of just what is secure. Secure from the casual hacker that might try to get into your network is one thing. If the resources of the NSA are applied to getting by your security it's an entirely different matter.The second chapter continues this analysis through the design of a threat model. Just what is it that you want protection against?The chapters that follow go into the design of a secure system, followed by some case studies that are used to illustrate the theoretical discussion points from the previous chapters.It would be nice if the world out there were a friendlier place, but it isn't. If it's your job to set up a secure system using MPLS, this book will provide the basic background information you need before you start entering parameters into the various security devices."
1,Horrible pump website is down no way to contact manufacturer,"Horrible pump, purchased from Amazon on August 14, 2012 and today October 6, 2012 pump will no longer cycle. To add fuel to the fire the manufacturers website is down and there is no phone number to contact them. Buyer beware!"
1,poor choice of bilge pumps,sounds good on paper does not function automatically. If you want peace of mind use traditional float switch for auto function. Gradys was the only positive part of this purchase.
3,Impeller seems to stick,This is a back up blige pump. My current Rule 27s stops because of sticky impeller so the peace of mind of an automatic bilge pump is lost.
4,Efficient,"If you grew up during this period and are a casual fan of Styx, then this cd may be all the Styx you will probably need. As I recall, radio played their hits endlessly, so much so I don't listen to them often today. But as a collection, this cd contains their most memorable hits."
3,At least they were original.,"Styx is a band that you can use as an example of the excess of the music of the 1970's. Overblown vocals, bombastic organ and synths fighting against a more down to earth rock sound, this band is easily made the object of ridicule. But they still made some memorable songs, from the rocking of ""Miss America"" and ""Too Much Time On My Hands"" to soaring ballads (""Lady"" ""Babe"") Styx did have some talent and a way to capture your attention. The Grand Illusion is probably their only recording that stands up on its own, so the greatest hits packages are probably the way to go."
2,Middle ground,"Everybody seems to be giving this either 5 stars or 1 star, hailing the band as great, or condemning them as incompetent.The truth, I think, lies decidedly somewhere in between, with this album deserving 2 and a half stars (if Amazon would allow such). No more. No less.What Styx did, and did fairly well, was standard commercial radio fodder for the mid 70's to early 80's. Judging such by today's standards isn't entirely fair, but such is always inevitable.Great art is was not (not by any stretch of the imagination) and while the vocals of Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw were not always pleasant to hear, the band had a modest way with the hooks that could overshadow such oversight.In other words here lies some entertaining, but hardly consequential music, and this album represents a time capsule of American pop culture circa 1975-1983. It isn't likely to be played in music appreciation classes in the year 2100, but some of it will probably get you humming along today."
5,I love Styx!,"Fast service, came ahead of schedule with no damages to case or cd. I've already had many enjoyable listening hours and have added it to my playlists on my computer."
4,SWEET!,"IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR ""SWEET MADAM BLUE"" AGAIN! THAT SONG REALLY ROCKS, IF YOUVE NEVER HEARD IT, YOU MUST BUY THIS CD JUST TO HEAR THAT SONG. THERE ARE MANY OTHER AS WELL. CRYSRAL BALL SOUNDS BETTER THAN EVER TOO. HEY STYX! THANX FOR THE MEMORY'S!"
1,F for sound 1995 remaster,"seems like anything before year 2000 sucks, this is even a remaster, does not matter, sucks for sound. If I have to turn all my cd players up to near full blast to get a half way decent sound out of it, then it sucks. seems anything redone or released 2000 or later I only have to turn it up 2/3 or 3/4 at most to really get it jamming.man do I ever miss the days of albums.Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear."
1,This is rock?,"These guys were the most pompous, pretentious, self-imortant band ever. Forget 'em and listen to some real rock-n-roll!"
1,Worst of the Worst,"Abandon all hope for ye who enter here folks, this is god-awful, dire stuff indeed! This is the kind of slick, pretentous ""art-rock"" drivel that made my adolesent years such misery. Dennis DeYoung's hideous vocals sound sound like a demented leprachaun on helium, and the grandiose trashing of keyboards and synthesizers--a style so near and dear to the heart of tight-pants, mullet-headed art rockers is enough to make all reasonable and intelligent people turn homicidal. I don't know whats worse, bands like this or the mullet-headed nauseating fans who love them so. They should all be made into soylent green and fed to record executives. . ."
1,Worst. Band. Ever.,"God, I hate STYX. If that singer guy wanted to do big musical rock albums, why didn't he just do a rock opera? What, is he too good for rock operas or something? What a dink."
1,Whats So Great About STYX?!?!?,"Renegade probaly the only good song these guys have ever recorded and it should of stayed that way. These guys are pretty crappy compared too most 70s rock bands and sound the same as the sounds of kansas reo speedwagon stuff like that is OKAY but in small amounts. personally STYX just sound the same every song Come Sail Away is only the worse song i've ever heard in my life. A forgotten band that is only remembered by cheap complimations and people downloading Renegade off the internet or itunes. Ehhh go for some actullay good stuff like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, or Pink Floyd."
5,Awesome STYX album,I had listen to STYX over the years; however never purchased their album until now. This album is soooooo good and worth every penny. A must have if you are a STYX fan.
5,They were once a great band,"As the title of my review says, Styx was once a great band. And this greatest hits CD proves that notion. Great songs like Grand Illusion, Come Sail Away, Too Much Time On My Hands, etc. Styx had three great lead singers in Dennis, Tommy, and JY. And they had class. These guys really need to hang it up, though. Ever since they became a Van Halen-wannabe band, (re: when they kicked Dennis out.) I have lost all respect for them."
5,Styx is awesome!,I never tire of Styx's great songs. I didn't listen to them much growing up; they were very popular but I was into ACDC!Now it's all Styx!
4,CD to mp3 conversion,"I usually purchase the Greatest Hits albums of various groups, because I get the best songs for the price. I convert my music to mp3/mp4 files in iTunes, and listen to them on my computer. I like several genres of music, Rock, Country and Pop."
5,Styx,"When I play the Styx Greatest Hits CD, it is like going back in time. So for a few minutes each day I can be in my twenties again."
3,OK but there is better,"I bought this CD locally 10 years ago and, while an OK compilation, I always felt some great songs were missing. A friend gave me the ""Come Sail Away"" 2-disk set last year and it is a better mix of Styx songs. I would recommend the 2-disk anthology over ""Greatest Hits"" to anyone."
4,Styx G.H.,I really enjoyed this album. It covers all the primary hits from STYX and was a great reminder of how talented this group was.
3,what?,I am going to a Styx concert and wanted to brush up on the words. The sound quality of the CD is not great. There was no sheet with the words included like so many other CDs have.
4,Good Group,"Many familiar melodies in this collection! Would be interested to see them on the county fair circuit. Last time I saw them, there were on the ""Grand Illusion"" Tour."
2,Poor packaging blame placed on post,"I have written several times, because I was not pleased by the condition of the item I ordered as a gift. I have never had it so beaten and battered. I was offered a new case, which I could do myself in lieu of exchange. I have used amazon when looking for various items, never in poor condition although I have frequently ordered used items.From this time forward, I will probably use the site less, and go to others available. As I have stated before, I am extremely disappointed."
5,"""LoveAtFirstSite""is Missing From this GREATcollection","All the hits are fantastic,but one of my favorite cuts,""Love At first Site,"" is missing.I just love that song,but this record is one of my favorite greatest hits collection from any group.GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN GUYS,with you LEADER."
5,STYX IS BOSS,STYX IS A BOSS BAND. THEY ARE VERY UNDER RATED AND DONT GET THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE. BY THIS CD. I AM GOING TO SEE THEM IM LOWELL TOMORROW NIGHT. BOSS BOSS BOSS
3,No more Mr. Roboto PLEASE!,"This album is good up until cut 10. You can forget it after that. I'm sure most of the members of Styx would also like to forget them, also. The songs are good, some very good. By far the best song on it is the Tommy Shaw penned ""Too Much Time On My Hands"". ""Too Much TIme"" is very unlike any other Styx song. Styx could have been a great band, had they given the reins to Tommy Shaw instead of Dennis DeYoung they could have been one of the great bands of all time!!"
1,OUCH.....,"yeeeeow, ouch, stop - PLEASE...can it be that people are still listening to this? This was offensive when it first came out - and it was in-style THEN. Haven't people learned anything over the past 20 years. The person that keeps putting those 5 star reviews out their must be one of the band members.....either that or it's Hypo.Mr. Roboto???? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...the band should be embarassed...horse-whipping is too good for them..."
1,The worst of the worst,"If the record label truly wanted to put together all of the ""greatest"" hits by Styx they would have ended up with a blank CD. Nothing Styx ever did was great. They were a generic, over-produced band that never reached beyond the bland corporate sound of their era."
4,"They were cheese, but really GOOD CHEESE!","I bought this because I love their up-tempo rock stuff (Too Much Time On My Hands, Loreillei, Best Of Times, etc) and was floored by the fact that A) I remember most of their stuff from the radio when I was growing up in the 70s (I was a kid) and B) the songs are cheesey but blow away the crap that passes as pop music today. The press hated them, fans loved them and the band was one of the true superstars of the mid 70s to early 80s. I know Mr. Roboto is a reason a lot of younger people have discovered them (thanks to Volkswagen) but I hope more people look past that annoyingly catchy ditty to enjoy the brunt of their 70s stuff for the quality pop music it is."
2,Relic of a bygone era,"This collection of ""hits"" is nothing more than a relic of a bygone era. If you were between the ages of 12-17 during the late 1970's this might be of interest to you. Otherwise you'll this band's modest (at best) charms will probably be lost on you."
1,styx- greatest hits(screwed up ! ),"I love the band Styx- I grew up with them. This CD was terrible- someone REALLY messed up and transformed it with a fake sounding technological ""new sound"" !All I listened to was one song and it was literally disappointing and sickening!"
3,Good Sound; Could have been better choices,"This review refers to the 95 CD.The sound quality is very good and the songs sound original to my ear (except for ""Lady 95"", of course). The musicianship is excellent.My biggest disappointment is not having the original version of ""Lady"".For the most part, the big hits are here,12 of them anyway.Four songs on the CD were not hit singles: ""The Grand Illusion"", ""Crystal Ball"", ""Suite Madame Blue"", and ""Miss America"". The first two of those were album title tracks, so maybe they belong on the CD. I would have replaced the last two with hit singles: ""Rockin' the Paradise"" (No. 8 Mainstream Rock), and ""Love at First Sight"" (No. 25 - Billboard Hot 100).FYI: I'm a record collector of 55 years and a sometimes deejay."
5,What Nutcase Wouldn't Like This Music,"This Is The Best CD Styx Has Ever Made!! My 2 Favorites Are ""Come Sail Away"", And ""Crystal Ball"". Both from the su pergroup 70s era. Awesome Vocals by Tommy Shaw, Dennis DeYoung,and JY(James Young) ITs Better Than Tht New ""'N sync'and Eminem ... If You Like Great music, Buy Styx Greatest Hits today,right nowThe only flaw is that the song ""Just Get Through This Night is not on here from the concept album""Kilroy Was Here(another favorite CD)"
1,I CAN'T STAND STYX!!!!,"This is the type of music that real rockers make fun of! The horrible squealing on ""Come Sail Away"" is pure torture to the listener! Try listening to BOSTON or BAD COMPANY first. They could teach STYX a thing or two about real rock 'n' roll!!"
1,The worst,"I am actually STILL embarrassed to live in Chicago because of this band. It is band enough that Chicago produced this horrible excuse for a band, but the state of Illinois also produced REO Speedwagon, another group faceless, untalented hacks fronted with some of the worst vocals of all time. The songs are bad, the group stinks. You don't want this!"
3,styx,styx was a rock band from chicagostyx started a long time agostyx had 5 membersstyx played songs that made the hit charts3 stars means no commentI wish I could just delete my reviews
1,Shudder,"Among the reasons to forget the 1970's, Styx is near the top of the list. Pompus, self-important, and utterly lacing in originality, they were part of the reason why punk happened - there really was something to rebel against.For that, I suppose we should be grateful, but in no way should we actually listen to this pap."
2,"The music is awesome, but the CD skips","I ordered the CD and received it in a timely manner but unfortunately once we unwrapped it and played it we discovered it skips. I guess once it has been opened we have no recourse. The music is great, the skipping takes some of that away...If it didn't skip I'd rate it 5 stars."
2,"Two words, Mr. Roboto, but a few nice tracks","I decided to pick up this album for my large collection and I found that Styx get a little bit, annoying. Let me be honest, I love Time On My Hands. But songs like Come Sail Away and Lady are a bit sappy..........actually, really sappy to the point of annoying. Styx were huge in the 80s. But I wouldn't buy a ticket to a concert, but I'd go if someone gave me a ticket. The guitarist has good taste too though.Oh yeah another reason this one gets 2 stars, MR. ROBOTO."
2,"Aw, come on people ...","Although I consider ""Too Much Time On My Hands"" a guilty pleasure, Styx is to rock music as Pee Wee Herman is to pro wrestling.Many years ago, I had a guy working for me who had been a roadie for Styx in his younger days. He told the story of the night the entire roadie crew walked off the job -- they just couldn't stand to listen to the ""music"" anymore. What else is there to say?"
2,Why do I own this?????,"I should punch myself for owning this. The crazy thing is, that once this music was popular. Mr. Roboto? What were they thinking? I recently saw the Styx Behind the Music. Yikes, they basically admitted they stunk, but laughed all the way to the bank. Ugh. If you like meaningless music, go ahead and buy this junk. If not, welcome to the land of the living."
2,Mid-level band,"When I bought this CD a week ago, I felt it's worth to have it. Now, I feel somewhat unpleasant to listen the singer's voice..."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Among the reasons to forget the 1970's, Styx is near the top of the list. Pompus, self-important, and utterly lacing in originality, they were part of the reason why punk happened - there really was something to rebel against. For that, I suppose we should be grateful, but in no way should we actually listen to this pap."
1,Oh my ears!,"Why listen to this when you can scrape a fork across a chalk board? Its cheaper, and actually considerably more pleaseant to listen to."
1,No more,"When I was in Jr. High school I was a huge Styx fan. Songs like ""Come Sail Away,"" ""Fooling Yourself,"" ""Why Me,"" ""Miss America,"" etc were all time faves.In retrospect I am amazed I can admit this. Listening to this music now is quite painful. The lyrics are stupid, the music pretentious, and the production quite pedestrian.I have grown up. It is time for the rest of you to as well."
5,A Great Album,"This is just a terrific CD. Every song on here is wonderful to listen to. From the classic ballads such as Lady and Come Sail Away to the hard rock of Renegade and Miss America, this CD has all of it just perfect."
2,Ehhh.,"Styx are a great band, one of my favourites. Don't get me wrong by my rating, I love Styx. It's just that this greatest hits isn't that great. I saw pretty much what I'd expect-- their later, poppish songs. None of these songs are from their first four albums except Lady, I saw. If you want to really hear Styx's real sound-- awesome guitar rock-- look into their earlier albums."
5,Truely the Best,This is a great selection for the casual fan or anyone looking for an introduction to Styx!Ignore the negative reviews from people who don't like the band to begin with.
5,Can't believe there are so many great songs on one cd!,I grew up with Styx's music but until recently I had forgotten how many great songs they had. I came across this cd and was pleased to see so many great songs on one cd. Buy it. You will love it!
4,Essential Dolphy,"4.5 stars. This makes for a very enjoyable listen. Many recordings from the early 1960s sound dated--to me, this one has a timeless quality. The combination of Dolphy's unique style (on several instruments) and Ron Carter's cello work (both bowed and picked), makes for some rare sounds and harmonies. The main reason I've docked OUT THERE half a notch is that the leader's solos ramble a bit much (i.e., they are not as logicial and coherent as usual for him, at least to my ears) on a couple of the tracks. Overall, I prefer FAR CRY, the album Dolphy made a few months later with the outstanding young trumpeter Booker Little--don't miss that one. But OUT THERE is certainly also recommended if you're attuned to or becoming acquainted Dolphy's music. This CD is newly re-mastered and sounds great."
3,water purification tablets,Sorry to say i cannot review as i have put them in a backpack for emergency situations only. I did lots of research before i chose those as they seem to be the best. If i use them i will update review.
5,Katadyn Micropur MP1 Water Purification Tablets (30 Count),"Great product used it and did not get sick, Tested it on stream near house for 3 days of drinking and did not get sick. This is where I will be getting water from when SHTF. So the teat went well and we are healthy after test. Will get more now and it does what it says."
2,All A-BORED the Holiday Train,"Are you an elevator owner in search of some Christmas music to play in it? Then this is the CD for you.Do not be tricked into believing this is a Duke Ellington recording. This is a group called the ""Duke Ellington Orchestra"", but it was recorded decades after Sir Duke himself passed away. The music is basically light-jazz, with very little excitement. It closes with a pretty good ""Auld Land Syne"" and that is about all it has to recommend.As Henny Youndgman might have said, ""Take the Holiday Train... Please!"""
3,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : ... it is to ride ?","Wheww, whewww, ~ You outt'a know where this train is bound, then find that discounted ticket if you can. ... if you are seeking a heavy horn hoilday hiatus, get on. ... if you marvel in a bigband sounscape that flows flawlessly from mix into lead and then back, get on. ...if you search for sudden sterophonic seasonal surprisals and like a good tweak from traditional, get on. ... if you apprecitate lush lady lounge vocals used in a instru-tinsel stylist groove, get on. ...Post Script... Overall quality started as a four star ticket, but I punched a 1\2 star each for chew chew chosing only seasonal standards and no load after track 9. buyit*saveit*sharesome* ~~~YULEridGemality Factor = 0"
1,How Can People Be SO Naive????,"Please DO NOT read this book or ANY books written by her or any of the similiar ""mystics"" who falsely claim to receive visions by God. It is a money-making ploy and what is worse is that people actually believe it and spread these lies. Don't enable the devil!!!! If you want to read God's revelation, pick up a Bible. I wish I could give this book 0 stars."
1,Warning Teachers!,"I am extremely disappointed with this pencil sharpener. I bought this for my fourth grade classroom and it worked well for the first year. Toward the end of the year it started to ""buzz"" when you pressed on the pencil and wouldn't finish sharpening. Turns out one of the gears inside is made of a soft plastic and wears out easily. When I called customer service to request a replacement I found out that my warranty was void because I sharpened a colored pencil in it! I was politely told that I couldn't buy a replacement gear, but could buy a whole new pencil sharpener if I would like! I paid nearly $80 dollars out of my own money to get a decent pencil sharpener only to be disappointed by the horrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend this sharpener to anyone.*Edit - After weeks of arguing with Customer Service I finally got a replacement which I will be keeping on my desk and only using myself, no student's allowed. We will see if it lasts any longer."
1,sharpener,"This sharpener is garbage. I purchased it for my classroom. I don't allow the children to use it because I was afraid they would mess it up. Myself and another teacher sharpens the pencils every morning for our class. I purchased this in September 2011 and this is only Feburary 2012. The shapener is not working already. This was just too soon providing only adults have been using it. We handle it with care. So I would not waste my money on this product. However, on a better note, Amazon did deliver this product quick. No reflection on amazon, but the product is just garbage. Don't buy this sharpener. I can't afford to keep wasting money especially living on a teachers salary. If anyone knows of a good heavy duty sharpener, please let me know. This is my 4th sharpener I have purchased."
2,"Mine Broke, But I Fixed it for Good","I'm a MS Science & Art teacher and I've gone through at least one ""Commercial"" pencil sharpener a year since I've been teaching. Doesnt matter the brand-- Xacto, Bostitch, whatever-- they are all a piece of junk and put cheap plastic parts that are designed to wear out. I bought this model and it lasted 6 months before it started making an awful noise and quit. The teeth on the main gear were wore out. Happens to almost all of them. But I found its replacement gear on Shapeways and it snapped right on. Works like a charm and its WAY better quality than the piece of crap gear that came on it. Seems like a lot for a little gear, but if it will save me from buying a new $80 pencil sharpener every year, Im okay with that.[...]"
3,Not as quiet or strong as I would have liked,It will often stop in middle of sharpening and I have to retract the pencil a bit to get it going again.. This is mainly with the large round pencils I use with the kids.
3,"A lot of money, lasted less than a year","I bought this for a 3rd grade classroom. Based on other comments, I limited student use (only an adult could use it.) After 10 months, it no longer works. It started great -- quiet and quick (although it has always sharpened pencils unevenly.) Now it is loud, and takes more than a minute to sharpen a pencil -- it makes a high pitched whine half the time. I have a Royal sharpener at home that is not for high volume, yet I've been taking pencils home to sharpen and it has performed better than this. (Just went back to time it -- I've sharpened pencils in 15 seconds and about 60 pencils tonight -- evenly too!)Bought a Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp6(TM) Classroom Pencil Sharpener With 6-holes And Quiet Motor, Blue (EPS10HC) for my husband's 3rd grade room -- that lasted one month and the motor stopped, and can't be returned to Amazon. Another out of pocket expense.Still looking for a good classroom pencil sharpener.....please let me know if you've found something."
2,Lasted one year,"This sharpener lasted only 1 year (minus 2 months of non-operation.) The previous sharpener lasted about 2 years, and I had hoped to have this one last as long, but the blades started to dull which caused the plastic gear (the only plastic moving part in the entire sharpener) to strip."
2,false warranty,I bought this product (model # EPS12HC) because of the reviews and the SEVEN year warranty. When I received the product the paper work stated a THREE year warranty. What about this Amazon? You gonna make this good?Darlyne
2,Not so sharp sharpener,"Purchased this sharpener because it was on sale significantly below original price. Thought that if the original price were so high it must be a good sharpener. It basically is no better than a much cheaper model I already have. It tends to ""eat"" pensils (but the disclaimer in the package said that such pencils probably had ""uncentered lead"" - that means that most pencils are of that type). Also, it will just stop working and you have to jam a pencil in to get it to work.Wasn't worth the money, even at the discounted price of over $50."
1,Awful,"DOn't waste your money or time having to send it back. It broke after the fourth pencil sharpening. The motor wouldn't shut off unless I unplugged it each time. I have to say Amazon.com refunded my money very quickly, though which I was pleasantly surprised.I would give this product no stars but that is not an option here."
2,Runs great but absolutely no parts or support!,"Sharpener has run well for two years but needs a new set of cutters as they get dull over time. Being a ""commercial"" grade sharpener we bought several for the school. They have run well at all grade levels for over two years. I removed the cutters and called the Bostitch company to order some new cutters. Much to my surprise I was told that they do not sell replacement cutters for any of their sharpeners and that dull blades are part of normal wear and tear on the sharpeners. Their recommendation is to but new ones. That I will but they will be Elmers/Xacto models that have replaceable blades from now on. Shame on you Bostich for contributing to our landfills and not supporting you products. Consider this a lesson learned. For a home or small office fine but for a school/commercial application avoid this product."
1,Not enough power,"This machine was sluggish, and struggled to sharpen every pencil. Cheaply made. The shavings bin is awkward to put back in place. For now, I'll be keeping our old sharpener for our testing lab. This one has already been returned."
1,Crooked sharpener,"Bought this for my business. It's fast but unfortunately, sharpens pencil unevenly so there too much wood on one side. I tried rotating the pencil while sharpening but that didn't help. Ended up returning it."
1,Very disappointed,"I thought this was the one that would work in my classroom. Not so! The first one sharpened every pencil crooked. I threw away about 1 out of every 3 pencils just so my kiddos could have something to write with. Then I called and was sent a new one. Surely, that one would work. Not so! It sharpens every third pencil crooked too. It shouldn't be that hard to get one that works. I wouldn't have another one of these."
1,Mother ($/#%^) of all Pencil Sharpeners,"This sharpener was in classroom use for one year and it is no longer working. It sharpens the point so it is half wood and half lead, like I now see in so many reviews. DO NOT BUY! Based on the customer service reports in other reviews, I'll not expect them to replace it. It is clean inside but the problem is that it does not align the pencil properly. POS. I spent a lot of money on this sharpener because I was tired of buying cheap ones and getting a year out of them. Well, this one is going in the trash after one year too. The motor seems wimpy too."
2,No autostop feature,"It sharpens VERY FAST, but the autostop feature did not work. As fast as it sharpens I was concerned about this. The shavings receptacle was hard to put back on. I returned it. I was very disappointed. I need a good sharpener I can depend on for my classroom."
1,"Good at first, didn't last","I am a classroom teacher in desperate need of a good pencil sharpener. I decided to go ahead and spend the big bucks on this one thinking it would be worth it just not to hassle with sharpening pencils. It worked well for a few months and then it just stopped doing quality work. Pencils sharpen on one side of the tip only, it gets jammed easily. It seems like the motor is too weak. Why can't they build a decent classroom sharpener?!"
1,Why even bother with manufacturing this thing?,"Sheesh! Is that how much this piece of junk costs? $78?! I don't know how long the one in the office been sitting there but I can tell you we don't use pencils a whole heck lot. I think we go through 100 pens before we go through a pencil.There's another Bostich one in the office, smaller, but just another piece of junk!I'm looking for one to use in my class that I teach as volunteer.Another post mentioned its being $34, I dunno....$10?"
1,Don't buy this pencil sharpener,"After two months of very light use at home, it already broke. The motor keeps running and doesn't stop until you unplug it. Amazon will not do anything because it is outside of their return window (1 month). Based on the price, I assumed that it will last (almost) forever. Well, it lasted two months."
2,Great start but HORRENDOUS finish . . .,"Ok, I bought this electric pencil sharpener for my art classroom about a year ago. We sharpen TONS of pencils in the art classroom and I bought this after getting blisters from trying to sharpen by hand the thousands of pencils that we sharpen in our classroom.I was VERY happy with this machine for the first 6 months of its use, then all of a sudden without reason it started sharpening less and was sharpening the pencils crooked. Now, just today it got stuck in the working mode, so I unplugged it. It has been making a HORRENDOUS clanking sound while it ""worked"".I would not recommend that anybody get this that uses a sharpener regularly (read daily) for heavy use. It just did not hold up. Quite honestly I have not found one that does. I am VERY disappointed that I spent so much money on this piece of junk."
2,Fast...but doesn't give a good point.,"I like the idea that this sharpener has dual sharpeners. And it certainly can chew up a pencil quickly. But when it's all said and done, it gives an uneven point. I understand that some pencils are cheaply made and could leave to an uneven point, but this wasn't the case. I tried the same pencil in a small hand sharpener and my old bostitch that will barely run. But in this sharpener, the point is off center with the wood of the pencil almost to the point of the sharpened pencil. I can turn the pencil 180 degrees and move the off center of the sharpening. So I've returned it and am looking for another sharpener."
1,Unsatisfactory,"Initially the price attracted me, it was a great deal for the features that were listed. Unfortunately, the pencils I wound up with weren't useable. The point I ended up with in every instance had to be reworked with a razor blade. In a nut shell, it doesn't work."
1,It Failed with the First Use,"I plugged in the pencil sharpener, and started with a group of a dozen pencils for my class. At pencil #11 the sharpener stopped working. It just makes a humming sound when I insert a pencil. I cannot get it to work. I'm going to have to pack it up and send it back."
2,Too hard to follow,This will be going in my pile of junk workout dvds. It's really hard to follow. I felt like I was spending more time trying to figure out what she was doing than actually working out. Don't spend the money.
3,Just ok,Was a bit disappointed in this one in comparison to the cardio strength ones. HR didn't get too high and didn't really break a sweat. I'd rate this intermediate.
3,Not my favorite,This was not my favorite workout. I have a large collection of workout DVDs and was very hopeful for this one. I have the two Peak 10 Cardio Strength DVDs and I love them so I thought I would try the Cardio only. The moves were a bit dancy or something for me that I felt that I was concentrating so much on the moves that I was not able to get an intense enough workout. I prefer the Amy Dixon Breathless Body DVDs that have more simple and intense moves for full cardio. I am going to try this one a few more times to see if it grows on me.
1,product had separated in jar,"Description sounds great but product arrived separated into an oily top layer and stiff gelatinous bottom layer, like old jello. They would not recombine when mixed. Might work if you get a fresh batch."
2,Leaves Much To Be Desired,"While this product boasts three different versions of the game, they are mostly the same except for some different roads. I suppose it's an okay game if you're just looking to kill time. I thought for the price it was being offered, I would be getting myself a bargain with 3 games! However, I quickly found out that the three versions are so alike you are really only getting the one game, with a couple different ""boards.""If you were a close friend of mine, I would not recommend that you buy this game. However, if you are really into the overhead views and the similar aspects of all three games - be my guest."
4,Better than a stick in the eye...,"These game are historical. You can clearly see where GTA3 evolved from. The original GTA is worth a look for historical purposes only. GTA: London '69 is entertaining until you get a headache from the painfully low-res graphics. GTA2 is one of the best games for PS1. If you want a video game museum, this should be your top exhibit. If you want a GTA game for your PS1, just buy GTA2 alone. If you have a PS2, skip this collection and buy your GTA3 and/or GTA: Vice City now!"
2,New night guard,I am not comfortable w/this mouthpiece. Will try it a while longer then probably go back to my original nightguard. It moves while I'm sleeping and makes sores inside my mouth. I really do not think it was worth the cost.
5,Excellent Affordable Nightguard,I love this nightguard. I had tried a custom made one and still had problems with jaw pain. This cured my TMJ pain and it does not take long to get use to wearing it.
2,Warning-Product description and photo are wrong,This does NOT hold an iPhone/iPod as pictured or described in the title. I just received mine and at full width it's not wide enough. Interesting that the description and photos are the same as this one:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000H280QW/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&m;=A6U7LGCOJZZG2&v;=glancewith a different item number below it.
3,It's ok..not great,"When I got this in the mail it had an option of a sticky pad(if you wanna stick it to your dashboard) & an adapter for the back of it(to attach to your vent).The sticky pad don't work too well because it's not like crazy glue..and what happens when it gets hot in your car? The glue gets hot too & it melts it's easy to fall off the dash.I suggest you use the adapter for the vents...BUT as time goes by(a couple of months) the adapter gets looser & looser, so it loses it's grip on the vents & falls out on hard turns.But over all it's good...the adjusting button still works & it fits my Sony MP3 real nice!"
5,Classic modern latin dance music from the 1970s,"This swinging set of New York salsa/son cruises through the sweet, summery sounds of old-timers such as Chocolate Armenteros, Henry Fiol, Rey Roig, Roberto Torres and several less well-known (but no less thrilling) Cuban-American dance bands. It's great stuff, a collection that easily holds its own next to all the other salsa and boogaloo reissues out there these days. The liner notes are funny, though, with two parallel perspectives on the ""salsa"" vs. ""son"" nomenclature -- there's one strident argument that says the word ""salsa"" was all marketing/public relations BS, and another, mellower version that says, ""Who cares? It's the same music, and it's all really good."" I guess I slide into the second camp: when you've got stuff that sounds this sweet, why get all hung up on the name? This is a great collection, definitely worth checking out."
5,jon bon jovi,i like the book very much. It had alot of things in it that I didn't know about him. if i could i would read it again
4,A thriller set in medeival England,Politics and money drive a gruesome murder mystery in medieval England. It captures most of the elements of a first rate mystery with an added dimension of describing life in the Middle ages in England. The portraits of all the characters are very well drawn - each one has their own flaws and weaknesses. Owen Archer and his wife work through the reasons for the murders and the book does not try to tie up everything neatly but leaves the reader hungry for the next book
5,Gentle Genius!,"Not until you see these works of art do you appreciate the genius of Nick Park's film-making.These are short films with little dialogue and few characters which entrance everyone I know, young or old, wherever in the world they live.Simultaneously funny and sad, full of apprehension as well as delight, it is difficult to know what to praise first - the animation, the wonderful relationship between the limited Wallace and the clever Gromit, the ""sets"" and lighting, or the hundred and one other things that contribute to the overwhelming impression of true perfection in film-making.How lucky we all are that this genius is available to anyone who wants to experience it, just for the cost of a DVD. Not to be missed!"
5,what a great collection of short films!!!,"i was introduced to wallace and gromit from my boyfriend who moved here from england, and i must say that these two are my new heros. wallace who kind of reminds me of inspector gadget is a riot, and his side kick gromit, dog wonder of the 21st century. if only there were more than three films!!! i could listen to wallace talk all day, and gromit is just your normal relaxed quiet pet who has a mind of his own, and likes to knit. i hope if you get this, you enjoy them just as much as i did."
5,Cracking DVD Gromit!,"I love Wallace and Gromit. It's simple. I don't recall where I first saw the duo, but I liked them immediately. With great animation, humor, and Gromit, the three stories are superb and never repetative. I can't pick a favorite episode because they are all great - you can rest assured that whichever episode you watch first will draw you in - although I love the high speed chase at the end of ""The Wrong Trousers.""If you like witty and interesting stories, even if you don't like claymation, you'll find Wallace and Gromit a refreshing break from the traditional fare. It's easy to get hooked, and hopefully they'll get a higher profile thanks to the success of the wonderful ""Chicken Run."" If you liked that, you'll love Wallace and Gromit, the originals!"
5,hoorah for a grand day out,"1st. Dont class a grand day out to the other 2. When this came out it was groundbreaking in every way, nothing came close. Thats why the second was better, it was meant to be. 2nd. Buy this. Not only do my 2, 8 & 9 year olds watch this, they have worn out the tapes. They aren't boring, are truely English and you won't be disappointed. Better than anything Disney will ever put out."
5,wallace and gromit,I looked many places to find this and I am so glad to receive it in such great condition at a good price. Thanks.
5,This is why this won Oscars!,"Just look at the effort put into this movie. It's not computer graphics, it's actually clay figures. The shoot the camera, pause it, move the clay figure a little bit, shoot the camera. It'll take forever and every episode made every deadline. Wallace and Gromit is funny, creative, original, and great for people of all ages. You can also make fun of how dumb the Englishman in the video is, although not nice, it ads a lot to the film."
1,The worst animation on Earth,"If you can stomach ""Wallace and Gromit"",I admire you.This is the absolute WORST animation on Earth!I felt like I was punishing myself by watching this horrible DVD.The stories had no plots-they were just a bunch of adlibbed scenes slapped together in hopes of making a plot.The animation itself is sloppy,choppy and cheapThis is NOT worth your time-if you want a good cartoon-get ""Tom & Jerry"" or ""Popeye"" instead."
4,Wallace and Gromit a Grand Day Out,"In this cheesy yet clever, animated comedy short, Wallace and his pet dog Gromit live alone in 1960s London. While the two are planning their Bankholiday vacation, right before tea time, they discover that they have no cheese. Hell-bent for cheese, they decide to have their holiday in the one place to find cheese, the moon. The movie has almost a split personality, combining slapstick comedy for the children and some crude humor for the adults. Altogether it's an enjoyable film, but it may not catch the eye of older teens."
1,1 star because: It's NOT AVAILABLE!,"As soon as they release a reprint of this DVD, they can 5 stars... but until then, boooo! hissssss!"
3,Nicky Says....,"Wallace and Gromit- A Grand Day Out is a mediocre film. The main characters, Wallace and Gromit, are a man and a dog that are in the world of animation.Basically, the story is about Wallace's hunt for cheese for tea time. They go to the moon to find cheese but they're not alone on the moon. Wallace and Gromit deserve a three out of five stars because some of the writing was a little unrealistic. Some of the movie was comedy aimed at viewers between five year olds and fourteen year olds. The movie looked like it was all claymation."
5,Delightfully funny and clever,"Each time I watch each of these episodes in the life of Wallace and Grommit, I find myself uplifted and inspired. The scripts are wondefully funny and clever (A Grand Day Out isn't the most fantastic, but it's still full of laughs) and the patience Nick Park must have in creating these animations is awe-inspiring. The transfer to DVD is wondeful - there's no fantastic sound effects, but one must remember the medium for which they were originally written."
5,"Solid entertainment, good DVD","Insofar as DVD's go, this one is somewhat strong. The Wrong Trousers behind-the-scenes is especially good although short (30 min) and left me wanting more (and it felt like there was more, but it wasn't included). There are some BBC Channel 2 spots from Xmas 1995 starring Wallace and Gromit, but each is only a few seconds long (with the exception of a bizarre spot where W&G stare at the camera for 1 minute). There are several very early animations from Nick Parks but they are extremely low quality and lacking sound. They're really there to show how far Parks has come. As far as content goes, there is good reason why this rated G title ranks as one of Amazon's best sellers. Well worth twice the price. (note: the 3-pack VHS gift set also contains the 3 shorts but does not include the behind-the-scenes stuff)"
5,Academy Award-winning work well worth your time,"It's easy to mistake this as children's material. But fortunately this is a case of a piece of art being genuinely for all audiences. It's appeal to children is somewhat obvious, but it's attraction for adults is all in the filmmaking. Don't let the claymation fool you: this is a *film*. Camera angles, lighting, scripts, shot composition and cinematography are all as carefuly crafted as the clay figures themselves. Humor easily works on several levels, and within seconds you'll be lost in the world of Wallace and Grommit--whether you have kids or not."
5,AMAZING ANIMATION.........WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!!,"the beauty of these three animated films lies not just in the hard work that has been put in making them but also in the thrill and joy one gets while watching these award winning masterpieces!being an animator, i feel i've never seen something as cute as this!!!!!hats off to nick park and aardman for creating one of the best or should i say THE BEST animated film ever made!!!this dvd, comprising of all three adventures, is a must see and must have for everyone!!"
5,"Outstanding animation, exquisitely captured on DVD","If you've never seen these wonderful pieces of claymation art, you're in for a real treat! Funny, original, we've seen them at our house OVER and OVER on VHS format. We rented the DVD version today, and here we are on Amazon adding it to our shopping cart! The images are crisper than ever and the sound is excellent. Even though it's stereo / dolby stereo, it has a richer sound than many of the 5.1's we've been seeing lately! As an added bonus, the special features are priceless, some of Nick Parks earlier (WAYYY EARLIER..) experiments with animation are included, as well as a sampler of how-to on ""trousers"". This one's a keeper!"
2,Muddy sound quality,"The original short cartoons by Nick Park are, of course, excellent. But the quality of this DVD does not do them justice. One of the main reasons people buy DVD's is for the excellent sound and picture quality. However, on this DVD, the sound is so muddy you can barely understand the dialogue. (The picture is fine.)Also, the Closed-captioning is hideous. I tried watching with the closed-captioning on, and the captions bore little resemblance to the dailogue. For example, early in ""The Wrong Trousers"", Wallace wants Gromit to make breakfast. He says, ""I'd like a three-minute egg."" The captioning reads, ""I've got three minutes, eh?"" After suffering through several such mangaled lines, my brain hurt so much I had to switch captioning off.The original cartoons are excellent. This version, this DVD, is terrible. Hopefully someday a good version will be released."
5,One of my favorites,"I love this video so much I had to upgrade it to DVD when I got a DVD player. Every time someone comes over I make sure they've seen it, or else that's added to the list of things to do! My favorite one is ""The WRONG Trousers"" - it's so funny and cute. I like the other two a great deal as well, and will often pull this out when there's nothing on TV."
5,Very artistic & adventurous!,"These are wonderful stories in claymation, filled with creativity, inspiration and science. The kids and parents both love the stories and content."
5,A Great Set with the Classics,"I bought this a few years ago and could never be happier. The first Wallace and Gromit film I saw was The Wrong Trousers. After that, I hadn't seen the others before at all. You can tell the age of A Grand Day Out, but it's still great! The two compliment each other- Wallace is the genius, while Gromit is the friend who pretty much knows what Wallace SHOULD have done to avoid an accident or explosion in one of his experiments (lol).The set doesn't include any of the really new films, but these three are a great watch, no matter what."
3,Decent,"This movie is an average Wallace and Gromit, so you really can't go wrong. It's better A Grand Day Out and Curse of the Were-Rabbit, but I'd recommend A Close Shave or The Wrong Trousers over this one. Extremely original and entertaining, as usual, but I can't watch it over and over like some of the others."
5,Crackin' Good!,"For those of you who aren't familiar with this duo, you don't know what you're missing! These have got to be some of the most creative and fun to watch animations ever made. They are so full of references, you'll watch them again and again to discover what new thing you'll see. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible and the plotline is interesting enough for grown-ups to enjoy just as much as kids (maybe more). It's fun to have this on DVD; my husband watched the part in The Wrong Trousers where Gromit follows the penguin to see what he's up to about a dozen times. I have watched all of them several times, and still find them just as interesting. Of course, having a background, however small, in British humor and style will help. I admit, I would have loved to see more behind-the-scenes footage - but I realize they can't give away all their secrets!"
1,Great program - bad DVD,"First of all, let me just say that the above rating in no way indicates how I feel about the ""Wallace & Gromit"" shorts, all of which are superb pieces of animation.My rating applies only to this slipshod DVD release, obviously intended to capitalize on the upcoming W&G; ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" feature, and lacking all of the wonderful extras of the previous BBC version.Gone are the Nick Park commentaries, the behind-the-scenes featurettes or the cute scrapbooks or photo galleries. In fact the only ""behind-the-scenes"" material collected on this disc applies to programs OTHER than the main W&G; films. A true disappointment.So, my advice is ignore this release and do your best to track down the old version. It will be well-worth the money."
1,Dissapointed with Dreamworks for editing the Wallace and Gromit shorts,"I give the ORIGINAL Wallace and Gromit shorts a 5 stars! They are funny, intelligent, wry, and perfect for persons of any age.I wish I had read the excellent Wallace and Gromit review above by Mr. J. Lee (first review when I posted my comments) before purchasing this DVD. I was very dissapointed with the editing imposed on the originals by Dreamworks.To add to Mr. Lee's list of edits to ""The Wrong Trousers"" I also noted that Dreamworks deleted an early scene in ""A Close Shave"" where the sheep go into the mincer and then get packaged as Preston Dog Food. These deletion results in ""A Close Shave"" being a bit incoherent at the conclusion due to the lack of reference to this earlier scene!Shame on Dreamworks! I can only hope to locate a version of the undedited Wallace and Gromit shorts on DVD somewhere and sometime!"
5,Pure Genius!,"I wish that the makers of feature length films would put half as much thought into detail as the makers of these 20 minute ""shorts"" did. Just look at the wallpaper, the items in the museum (a violin wrapped like a mummy), and flecks of paint on the ladder. The dialog is brilliant and the action is hillarious. Buy this now, or you may be cursed with dull children."
5,British wit at its best,I highly recommend this video to both animation fans and lovers of British comedy.
5,Incredible Value,Several years ago (before we had children) we bought these videos individually for about this price per video. My husband and I both love all three of them. We recently broke them out again for our near three year old. He looooves them. They are a perfect length of time for him and they are so clever. I only wish Wallace and Grommit would have some more adventures!
4,A timeless classic that just gets better with each listen,"This album wraps sweet soaring vocals around tight instrumentation and transports the listener back to days of their youth. It recalls summer memories, young love, and the blissful innocence of childhood. I can see how some listeners might be put off by Karen Peris' high pitched vocals but she has a beautiful and melodic voice that blends seamlessly with the rest of the band. This is my favorite Innocence Mission album, but Birds of My Neighborhood is a close second. You will not be disappointed with either album."
5,Better than Natalie,"A ringer for Natalie Merchant? Sorry, no. Better than Natalie Merchant? Definitely.I would have to say that Karen/Innocence Mission's output has been much more consistent (as in, always great, heartfelt and graceful), and I would recommend any IM cd very highly."
5,best pop/rock album of the last 10 years,"When I first heard ""Glow"", I thought that it was the Sundays. Karen Peris sings alot like Harriet Wheeler. ""Glow"" has 5-6 especially brilliant,catchy melodic songs and wonderful production quality. I have purchased this album for many musician and non-musician friends as gifts over the last couple of years, and every single one of those folks loved this CD. If you like pop/folk, and you like the Sundays, Once Blue, Prefab Sprout, then you must listen to ""Glow""!!!"
5,"years later, this is stil my summer time record :::",on this very perfect record they transitioned with huge growth from the Ritalin-dream where the lyrics were not understandable to the middle-state of dream-folk.the album tells a panoramic story beginning by getting tucked into bed and follows through with child-like anticipation of comings and goings... and it is part of the soundtrack of my life.
3,"Get ""Umbrella"" first!","I discovered this band from hearing the song ""and hiding away"" from their second album 'Umbrella'. 'Glow' may have more polished instrumental musicianship than their earlier work but it doesn't have the same inspired melodic genius, so I'd check out their self-titled debut album and 'Umbrella' first. Such a shame that Amazon doesn't have them available in mp3 format yet!"
2,Bad Design,"I don't have this model, but the one with the blue bubble shower cap, and it doesn't seem to matter when reading the other reviews of this model because the mildew problem is still the same! What were these manufacturers thinking?! The design leaves MANY crevices where mold develops (under the flip top, the spout area, in and around the inside..). I have to clean it out every week if that, and even then, some of the crevices are too small for even a toothbrush to reach, so now I will have to resort to soaking it in a diluted bleach solution.The only positive to say about this spout guard is that, yes, it does protect your child from bumping his head, but when they're toddlers, you will cringe to see them try to drink water out of the flip top and suck on it if there is MILDEW growing on the duck! All in all, this is a horrible product!"
1,Did not fit our spout ...,"If you have a newer spout, this product may not work for you. It did not fit our ""standard"" spout (installed 3 years ago).You may want to skip this product anyway. There is a bubble bath compartment under the duck's hat which can allow mildew/mold to collect if left wet. (My mother has a similar Munchkin spout guard which did just that.)The following product has worked great for us. (Sassy's definition of a ""standard"" tub spout is considerably broader than that of Munchkin.):Froggie Spout Guard"
5,Worked Great.,I live in a newer house and it worked great in my bathtub. My kid really enjoys it and it also helps so he won't hit his head on the spout.
4,Love it,It works. No more cuts on my son back from standing up. The Bubble bath dispenser works. The only down fall is you have to take it off to use the shower.
3,Clamp handle doesn't fit,"I just received this set in the mail today. It seems fairly nice, though it is smaller than I had expected.The problem is that the clamp handle doesn't work...it doesn't fit onto the frying pan. It is useless--serious design problem here. I'm debating whether to just forget about the frying pan, or to try to call their 800 number."
5,One of the best albums I've ever owned,Just one of those albums...I love every song from beginning to end. I really recommend it!!!
5,An Emotional Experience,"This is an absolutely perfect CD. Every song has its own twists and turns, moving your mind from the perception of feelings to the reality of emotion. ""Good Mother"" is inspired, dreamlike and truthful. ""Unloved"" is haunting and nostalgic. ""It Looks Like Rain"" shows the scope of her talent. Jann Ardin is an artist who was robbed of marquis fame when ""Insensitive"" became this CD's ""chosen"" song. How sad that it is the ONLY song in the collection that doesn't do her unique talent justice."
5,Incredible Lyrics,"Probably her strongest album, Living Under June includes some of Jann Arden's most commercially successful work. With the possible exception of Insensitive, this Canadian artist is little known outside of her country, but within it she is very popular, and with good reason. The music and her voice combine with the passion and violence of her lyrics to create an emotional effect that far surpasses the usual `he left me and I'm so depressed' theme so beloved by female chanteuses. Most of the album is excellent, my favorites are Unloved, Good Mother, Could I be Your Girl, and the title track, Living Under June. I'm not as fond of Insensitive as everyone else seems to be; it was rather overplayed on the radio stations here, but it's a fine song. With the lyrics seemingly the weak point of most popular songs, hers are exceptional and incredible."
5,A joy to listen to,This was my introduction to Jann Arden and I love this album.I'm not sure I can find a bad track on it. Her writing and her singing brings you on the journey with her.There are upbeat songs like: Could I Be Your Girl and more melancholy songs like: It Looks Like Rain.A wonderful album you can listen to at anytime. It made me a fan.
5,"I attended a Jann Arden live concert on Thurs., Aug. 07, 2007!","The concert opened the Fergus(Ontario) Highland Games. Entrance charge totaled $39.00 CDA (tax included)for this outdoor concert which Jann sandwiched between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. What a buy, and for a two hour concert! She is truly a gifted Canadian talent!"
5,Janntastic!,"What can I say- Jann is nothing but good! I have all of her albums and have been to see her twice- I never get tired of her tunes. If you have never heard her, her voice is really unique, and she is an amazing singer. She also writes her own music, which adds alot."
5,The first CD I ever bought,"I heard Jann Arden's ""Insensitive"" on the radio, and I loved it so much that I went to a music store and bought it. I hadn't bought a tape or a CD all by myself before and I felt like I was taking a BIG risk. But I LOVED IT SOOO MUCH! I have listened to it endlessly the past couple years."
5,Ever seen a grown man cry ??,Phenomenal. Not a bad track. the track Unloved is a powerful and never fails to bring a tear to my eye. This CD is one of my all time favs and has not left my 5 disk CD player since its purchase. Insensitive was sadly the only major hit in Australia so many missed out on the simple but contemporary adult style of this soflty sung superstar. Thank goodness for the net as this will enable me to keep up with further releases.
2,The Space between a life and a biography,"Michel Foucault is certainly not an easy person to write a biography of but ""The Lives of Michel Foucault"" does not rise to the task. It seems to me this might be a good biography of Foucault for French philosophers who like to read in English. The author breaks about every rule about elements of style and maddeningly insists on only referring to Foucault's works in French leaving the reader in need of a French dictionary. For references to the works of some (not all) other French authors who inspired Foucault the author condescends to add a parenthetical English translation. Perhaps most problematic is the author's unwillingness or inability to help the reader understand some of Foucault's truly astonishing insights that re-made structuralist studies and founded post-structuralist studies. A disappointing effort."
4,"Quirky, dark, rewarding","Mysteriously oblique, Omnipop is full of catchy, moody pop songs ranging from the Bond-like Entertainmen to cocktail and Weimer cabaret-like tunes. Heck, there's even a collaboration with REM. Written while playing a mute in Die Hard 3, the lyrics seem to be the product someone who can't find the words to articulate the world she's in, but it works."
3,Not for the Pure in Heart.,"If you liked ""Cruel Inventions"" then you will probably like this offering also. Ms. Phillips does touch on some of the interesting themes of Modernity. Her criticism of the ""tube"" is very timely as we watch the horror in Littleton, CO and see two mentally ill teenagers become infamous over night. Probably, just what they wanted. In the song Plastic is Forever we find the following lyric: ""pain is pleasure when its televised""; in Power World: ""look at how they've washed your brain down the info tv drain"". The reality is that ""nothing is so beautiful, nothing is so continually fresh and surprising, so full of sweet and perpetual ecstasy, as the good; no desert is so dreary, monotonous and boring as evil. But with fantasy it's the other way round. Fictional good is boring and flat, while fictional evil is varied, intriguing, attractive and full of charm"". (Simone Weil)"
1,I was expecting a lot more from this,"Its hard to believe that the same artist that gave us ""Martinis and Bikinis,"" a terrific CD, would produce such garbage as this! This is a TERRIBLE album. Save your money- buy a nice frisbee. That's what I use this CD for now."
1,Keep a leash on singer-songwriters,"For some reason, singer-songwriters feel often feel compelled sometime in their career to unleash at full throttle the imagined majesty of their vocal range in a haze of discondordant cacophony. Phillips does this on this album - run don't buy!"
5,Great for traveling,"The this filter goes with the Katadyn Micro water bottle. I use it mostly when I travel and hike. You never need to worry about unclean water no matter where you are. It is an easy system, doesn't require any more work than a normal water bottle and is the same size as a normal waterbottle. I just warn you about one thing: if you change elevation (ie hiking in mountains or especially on a plane), the pressure in the bottle changes and when you open it, water will squirt out at you... but there is an easy solution, open the bottle with the straw in your mouth. I also think that the bottle could use a lid of some sort to keep the straw/mouth piece clean"
1,"Frustrating, A Disappointment","The book is helpful in identifying anger in all its forms. You may be surprised, as was I, to learn how deep and strongly felt anger is in your life. But with that identification in hand, the book proceeds to offer simplistic solutions, unworkable and ineffective for all but the most shallow emotions. Much of Shoshana's advice can be summed up by saying ""you're doing something wrong, and you should stop doing it."" It's unhelpful."
4,Book Review,This book gives you a day by day plan to deal with and get rid of the anger inside of you. After the first week I was much calmer. My family has noticed the improvements in me. I definitely recommend this book.
5,One of the most complete bonsai books around,"Of the 20 or so bonsai books on my shelf, this is one of the most complete on the subject. It does not contain a species guide, but rather spend the effort on good solid information and techniques - just the way I like it. There are sections on plant physiology, soil, nutrients, and interesting mathematical guidelines on branch placements and ratio's not often found in other books on the subject."
2,Not much to it,This book has a few excellent articles at the beginning. But the bulk of the book is just a listing of every music school with a few brief (not helpful) facts and the web site for the school -- which google will give you for free.
3,Nostalgia from the fifties,Im 56 and I couldn't believe I had a chance of viewing movies I loved as a child.This is a fun loving movie of a father and daughter living together and Margie always making her fathers business her business. Pay attention to detail.the telephones cigarettes on the table set decorations. Fun viewing.
3,the music,musik yang mungkin berbelok sedikit dari pada aliran gothic metalapabila anda menyukai gothic metal mungkin anda kecewa setelah mendengar musik dari group iniakan tetapi sebagai pelengkap koleksi video ini patut untuk anda milikialiran musik sedikit cadas di sertai dengan sentuhan atmospheric
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this product for my son for Christmas. As a fireman enthusiast, he was so excited but quickly dissapointed when the items broke. The flash light never worked, broke on first try. Megaphone and phone do not make any noise. Very disappointed. He said ""Mommy why would Santa give me broken toys."" How sad. Safe yourself money and heartbreak do not purchase this item for your little fireman."
4,Firefighter playset,"Great assortment of firefighter accessories! The flashlight is not so good due to poor quality, but everything else is great for play!"
3,not worth it,"So I got this for my 4 yr old birthday, He always plays dressup fireman and always wants a mask, so he saw this and went nutts.the mask fits very funky and is huge, you can adjust the straps but its hard to get them and tighten them, then they tighten uneven, Ive neverhad such trouble with straps. the fire extinguisher is cute and sturdy and fun because it fills wth water and sprays. although he and I were very dissapointed that the cell phone and the speaker do nothing, i thought for sure you could put batteries in them and they would do something, not at all. oh well still a cute fun toy."
3,Disappointed,I expected it to be a more substantial. It was all just molded plastic. Nothing worked except the water bottle. Disappointed
4,3 Year Old Approves,"My 3 year old got this for his birthday, and he loves it. He was SO excited to have a ""real"" fireman mask. It would be cooler if some of the other pieces actually DID something (the phone and megaphone don't do anything), but he still loves it."
1,Stay away,"What a waste. Megaphone does nothing, mask doesn't even come close to fiting and the strap goes around my son's neck. Overall a 25 dollar pile of junk.I'llnever purchase anything from Theo Klien again."
2,Advanced Techniques covered too short,"If you build an portal, then you will have to integrate several 'j2ee'-applications. In the 'Bible' you'll find minimal help on 7 pages (out of 955!) to integrate JSPs and Servlets as portlet. The examples presented are partially buggy (e.g. p839 step 13. or p858 step 11. does not mention debuglevel, but step 13 shows the test page)."
1,This book is out of date,"Portal has been changing a lot, if you want your code to work, don't read this book"
5,Great tool kit,"I teach a biking unit to 3rd and 4th graders and am able to wear this kit on my belt... does just about everything without being bulky and heavy. Just a great product, easy to use.Would recommend to anyone."
4,honest engine,"I received this tool set with the intentions of being prepard in case my bike needed to be fixed on the road for myself or any of my friends who carry no and i mean no tools at all ,well this tool set works , its light and sturdy also very compact, now i have not compared this to any other tools of this size but i can tell you that i do like it very much and it works."
5,Requested gift.,Our son had this on his Christmas list. He's a long-distance biker and sometimes has to adjust something on the bike. He's very happy with this multi-tool.
4,Smaller size allows it to fit in your seat pack,"I bought this tool because it's lighter and easier to pack. Other tools are bulky and if you pack an extra tube, co2 cartridges and other gear into your saddle pack it gets crowded real fast. It gets the job done and doesn't take up much space."
5,Great tool!,"This is a nice mini tool with a 'kit' that includes all of the needed tools if/when you are in a situation that you need it. Small size with a good ""punch"" on options. Love it."
4,Feels sturdy,"All metal construction. Feels sturdy but have not have the need to use it other than to set my seat height and put on a bottle cage.The neoprene case is a plus, but it does not need it.Love the way the chain cutter is nested in the middle and out of the way till you need it. Most multi-tool has the chain cutter in one of the arm and can get in the way sometimes."
5,IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO WATC THE MOVIE LISTEN TO THIS!,"THE MOVIE IS A FOVORITE I FEELI AM REALLY INSIDE OF THE MOVIE. AND EACH ONE IS A PART OF ME. SO I HAD TO GET THE SOUNDTRACK I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID THAT THEY DIDN'T MAKE THEM ANYMORE. MY FAVORITE SONG THE ON 'THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE BUT YOU CAN GIVE THAT TO THE BIRDS AND BEES I WANT MONEY -THAT IS WHAT I WANT"" ISN'T ON THERE AND THAT REALLY PEVS ME OFF BUT OH WELL. IT IS STILL THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"The movie was great, the soundtrack sucks!","The movie is awesome, I'm sure every 13 - 20 year old out there agrees with me. The music in the movie was raw, but where did it go, 'cause it's not on the soundtrack. There were so many great songs in the movie, and I know a lot of people, and myself included, that thought the soundtrack would at least have two discs. The best song on the soundtrack is 'Til I Hear It From You'.'Sugar High' was raw in the movie, but its a different version the disc and it sucks; the one from the movie was so much better. You're better off not buying the cd. Buy the movie instead."
3,NOT SO BAD,THERE WERE SONGS THAT I DIDNT EVER HEAR ON THE MOVIE. AND SONGS THAT WERE ON THE MOVIE YET NOT ON THE CD.
3,soundtrack doesnt measure up to movie,"empire records is the best movie EVER MADE. i thought the soundtrack would be...i mean, its pretty good, dont get me wrong...but there are so many otehr songs in the movie. my friends and i can never figure out the names of other songs that were in it, so it would be helpful to have a more inclusive soundtrack. the sugarhigh film version should also be in the soundtrack--it is SO much better. overall, the soundtrack is pretty good, but it isnt nearly as good an album as empire records is a movie."
3,A little disappointing,"This soundtrack is filled with quite a number of pulse-raising, fast-paced songs that were typical of the mid-90s. Featured on the CD are ""Til I Hear it From You,"" by the Gin Blossoms, ""A Girl Like You,"" by Edwyn Collins, Better Than Ezra, the Cranberries, ""Crazy Life,"" and ""Sugarhigh.""However, I was kind of disappointed with this soundtrack in one major way. Like so many other people, after seeing Empire Records, I found that the soundtrack is missing a number of songs which I wanted to be on it. Where are ""Money- thats what I want"" by the Flying Lizzards, Dire Straits's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" Maxwell Caulfield's ""Say no more, Mon Amour, ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and ""Counting Blue Cars?"" Its because of these omissions that Empire Records needed another soundtrack.Great movie- only an OK soundtrack."
3,lot's of good songs but...,"okay, there are many, many songs in the movie, but most of the songs on the soundtrack i can't even find there, and sugarhigh wasn't even the same version! Don't get me wrong, they're all good songs but what i think should be done is they should put out ""Empire Records: the soundtrack, volume 2"" with all of the other songs, Who's with me?"
2,Watch the Movie if You Want to Hear the Songs,"I was extremely disappointed with the contents of this CD. If you are looking for a complete compilation of the music in the movie, ""you'll be sorry"" as Warren says. I agree with one of the other reviewers: They need to make a second volume with all of the great music they left off of the first album. Now that would be a smart marketing strategy..."
3,Dissapointing,"I really enjoyed this movie, and the songs were so good that I just had to go out and buy the CD. However when I listened through the tracks, I realized that half the songs I didn't remember from the movie, and the songs that I had hoped would be on the CD weren't. I was very dissapointed. The CD is pretty nice, but it just doesn't cut it. I agree with previous reviews, there should be an Empire Records Vol.2 CD."
2,I LOVE the movie but I wasn't impressed by the soundtrack.,"I do like some of the songs on it, but some of the more noticeable songs in the movie weren't on the soundtrack....such as Little Bastard by Ass Ponys, or Money by Flying Lizards, or even Mon Amour (or whatever) by Rex Manning......I honestly think that they should release a second soundtrack with those songs and the version of Sugarhigh that's on the movie, and Saddam A Go Go by Gwar...I'm sure they could find enough songs to fill a whole CD. That's all.....Damn The Man!"
3,Also Disappointed With The Lack Of Music!,"I'd like to thank Lightremedy for his review and list of the songs that are missing from the soundtrack. I was hoping that all of the songs from the movie, including Rene singing ""Sugarhigh."" In fact, I feel cheated by AM Records for not including that as thattt alone, was a highlight of the movie! At least, thanks to Lightremedy, I can find the other artists now and buy some of their CDs."
3,Too bad they didn't put any classics on the soundtrack!,"I absolutely loved Empire Records, (despite the fact that it had no plot), and was estatic when I found the soundtrack. However, I was disapointed when I found that many of the song that made the movie so great weren't included in the soundtrack. One of the things that I really liked about the movie was they used a lot of ""classic"" alterna rock songs, but none of them were included on the cd. Also, some of the songs that were included didn't play a big part in the movie, or weren't big highlights in the movie. But there are a lot of really great songs on it, and if I had to do it over again, I would still buy the cd, if not just for those songs. (Such as ""Free"" by the Martinis.) I recommend getting it used for a cheaper price."
3,A nice soundtrack but missing the essentials...,"Edwyn Collins and the Cranberries bring a really nice sound to this CD, but some of the movie's best tracks are missing. Where's Gore? And can someone please tell me which is the song that begins with ""the best things in life are free"". I'd love to know who sings it and how it's called. In the movie it's played when Music Town becomes Empire Records... Please help me!"
2,i just want to know one song,"ok if anyone could help me out that would be so great. im looking for a song that they have in the movie, at the part where warren comes into the store with a gun and he is shooting and in the background, there is a punk sounding song and i really would like to know what song that is! so if you know please please tell me."
5,This is my favorite CD,"Since I loved the movie and had already seen it a million times, it was automatic that I was going to love the sountrek to Empire Records. Sure, some of the songs are pretty old, but it still has that pleasing alternative beat. It is a great collection of songs."
2,where have all the good songs gone?,ok ok i understand it was a cool movie. but what happened to all the great music? i bought this soundtrack looking for more than the gin blossoms. they weren't the only good band. what happened to Video Killed the Radio Star? that is the best song in the movie if i don't say so myself.
5,it was great,"The movie was great..the music was greater!!!!!!! the actors really work well smashing proformang=ces by robin tunney and liv tyler, brendon sexton! END"
2,There's a lot missing...,"Yhe soundtrack is cool, but there were a lot of cool songs in the movie that are not in the cd. There are also a some songs in the album that are shouldn't be there.something i liked about the movie is that they mixed some alternative songs with some rock classics and some heavy metal. that made it a great soundtrack; but in the cd you can only find the alternative ones.the songs i think are missing are for example ""if you want blood, you've got it"" by ac/dc, ""video killed the radio star"" by the presidents of the usa and ""romeo and juliet"" which is one of my all time favorites by mark knopler and in the movie it's pretty well covered by indigo girls. there's also that song that mark puts at the beginning of the movie when he gets the turn to use the jukebox at first, that's a neat song and it's also missing.i enjoy some of the songs like sugarhigh, 'till i hear it from you, a girl like you and some others, but it would be nicer if it had the rest of them."
1,dancing on the rooftop,"the song that has the accordian-like intro is called ""This is the day"" by The The, it's also sampled on the ""become an M&M"" commercial. I think it's the one where they begin to dance on the rooftop."
1,SO disappointed in Maryland,"I loved this movie! But, WHAT WERE THE RECORD EXECS THINKING WHEN THEY RELEASED THIS SOUNDTRACK? It seems to me that the studio that released the movie decided that they didn't screw up enough with under-publicizing the movie's release, but they also had to include some of the hardest to find tracks in the whole flick! I am in complete agreement with the people who have suggested a second soundtrack for Empire Records although it will probably never happen. The fact that this movie was about a store trying to keep the industry giant from swallowing it whole and the poor quality of this soundtrack is not lost on the fans of the movie. Don't get me wrong, if you're looking for lite alternative and punk to keep you moving, it's a good buy. But if you're buying this because you loved the movie (and, movie execs, despite your seemingly best intentions to hide it from us, we LOVED Empire Records) and want the sounds of it to pour out of your speakers, save your money."
4,perdy good,"I loved the movie and couldnt wait to get the soundtrack, but i was a little upset when i got it because they left out a lot of songs that should have been in there, and put in a lot of songs that you barely hear in the movie, but overall it s a perdy good soundtrack, and Ethan Embry is awesome!"
3,Where's Social Distortion?,"I was very dissapointed beacause in the movie I heard that song from Social Distortion,but I bought this cd and it wasn't on it.Now I have no idea what the name of that is."
5,Pretty Cool CD,This CD is really good! But the best song is Sugarhigh. I listen to it all the time to get sugarhigh. (flemingo and the mean ole lion get sugarhigh off pixy stix)
3,What happened to all the songs?,This is still a great soundtrack but where did all the good songs go? I also liked the version of Sugarhigh from the movie better.
4,Pretty Good,"I liked alot of the songs on the soundtrack, but This soundtrack has alot of great songs on it. I agree that there should be a volume 2, as there are some more songs featured in the movie that could be put together for a sequel. Romeo and Juliet (by Dire Straits, I think) is very cool, as is the Social Distortion song. The other Cranberries song is good, too. The Collins song is awesome."
3,Descent,"This was my favorite movie for a while, and i was so excited to get the soundtrack, but my favorite songs weren't on it. i dont even know the names of the ones i like. If someone could tell me, it'd be nice so i can look up the bands. the one i really like is the song when thier opening the store in the morning. Marc chooses it, and AJ exercises his veto by turning it off and burning the cd. its a great sceene, and a good song. Well anyway, its a pretty descent soundrack if your interested in hearing some of the ""good"" music from the nineties(with acception to Nirvana and Marylin Manson of course)."
2,Not a good representation,"The movie ""Empire Records"" has one of the best ""song scores"" in any movie ever. As far as use of music goes, it's right up there with ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Rushmore."" The problem with this CD soundtrack, though, is that it contains some of the least memorable songs from the movie. Instead, they use songs by more well-known artists that were used as background music during dialogue scenes. I was listening to this earlier and I had a very difficult time placing where the songs had been in the movie. It's an abosulute crime that the song ""Seems"" by Queen Sarah Saturday (the song that is played when the kids are opening the store) does not appear on this disc, as well as ""Rock n' Roll EGA,"" and ""I Shot the Devil."" Instead of buying this, I suggest hunting down the songs individually."
2,This really sucked!,"What everyone else is saying about this soundtrack is true. There are only approximately two or three songs that I actually heard in the movie. And I watched the movie directly after buying the soundtrack. However those two or three songs were really good songs! I loved ""Sugarhigh"" even though Renee was not singing on the track. Why can't they just get it right once in a while?"
4,Empire Records,"great album overall...i especially like ""Til I Hear It From You"" by Gin Blossoms, ""Free"" by The Martinis, and ""I Don't Want to Live Today"" by the Ape Hangers. another definite plus was ""Sugarhigh"" by Coyote Shivers, the song that Berko's (played by Coyote Shivers) band played w/Gina at the end, although i liked the movie version better. Gina or no Gina, it still rocks. buy this album!"
3,Missing my favorite song!,"Hey, you know the song where Mark is dusting with the duster the items in the store and he comes walking down the stair case and he sees the girl listening to music and has ballerina shoes and he starts to dust her feet?????? Well what is the name of the song, I think that it is in ""cant hardly wait"" also, and in that it is where Jennifer L. Hewitt finds out that Preston is the guy who told her he loved her and who wrote her that letter, and she is walking around looking for him. I heard part of it in ""Cant Hardly Wait,"" well if you know the title then e-mail me ASAP Thank you!!!!!"
4,Because it would hurt a lot warren....,"I loved the movie, i have watched it over and over again. The soundtrack is fantastic but where is 'Romeo and Juliet' by Dire straits, 'money' and 'video killed the radio star'? Someone please tell me if they relese a second soundtrack for dedicated empire fans! I love 'Free' by the Martinis and 'Sugar high' rocks, Gina or no Gina! The soundtrack, it is worth buying if you don't have it, it has a song for all of your moods."
3,Where are the other songs?,"I love this movie. I have watched it so many times, and now I even own it so I wouldnt have to keep renting it. I bought the soundtrack thinking that the songs in the movie were going to be on it. I was very suprised when I listened to it because I did not recognize half the songs. The songs I expected and wanted on the CD just werent on it, for example the song played when they are opening up the store and Corey is making the coffee. And also the one where Joe is playing the drums and Lucas and Warren are dancing. Anyway, I was always hoping they would come out with a second volume of the soundtrack, but I guess not.... Even so, its still a good CD."
2,The Movie was Better,"I bought this CD because I thought its version of ""Sugarhigh"" would be the same as the film, but it turns out to be a disappointing version by Coyote Shivers alone--dirtier, less uplifiting, and far less fun and entertaining. Renee Zellweger's voice is sorely missed from this lackluster rendition. As for the rest of the CD, I don't remember having heard most of them in the movie, though it could just be me."
3,......And where's the rest?,"Great music in this movie, probably more than 1 CD's worth.There are some real good songs that were left off this. The two songs by THE DIRT CLODS were very good, the remake of Hendrix's ""Hey Joe"" and ""Can't Stop Losing Myself"". ""I Shot The Devil"" by SUICIDAL TENDENCIES and ""Romeo and Juliet"" by DIRE STRAITS are available elsewhere but would have worked well in the mix on the soundtrack. I'm very surprised that they also left off ""Counting Blue Cars"" by DISHWALLA which was a huge single around the time that this movie came out. Oh well, I guess you can't have everything...Nice try though."
4,A Great Start....,"Empire Records is one of my top three favorite movies. The soundtrack is great, but there is a lot of stuff missing, like ""Seems"" by Queen Sarah Saturday. That is the song that Mark plays while they are opening the store. And AC/DC's great song ""If You Want Blood (You Got It),"" the song that Joe plays on the drums. So, i know this movie is 7 years old, but do ya think WB and A and M records caould put out a second disc. I'd buy it in a hurry."
4,Still doesn't do Leahy justice,"Saw Leahy last summer in New Brunswick. As much as I enjoy their CDs, I am still left a little cool because of the impact their live show left with me. Don't get me wrong, you will enjoy the CD if you enjoyed their first one. This one shows a bit more development in terms of lyrics. Give it a spin, you won't be disappointed."
2,Not what you might think it will be,"I purchased this CD after hearing their latest CD ""In All Things"", and after seeing them live. The show was spectacular, and their latest cd is quite good. Imagine my disappointment when I realized that this CD would be far more appropriately classified as a CD for christian audiences! Upon realizing this, the CD was forcibly ejected from my player and will never see the light of day, or be spoken of, again. The musicianship was solid, but I feel as though I've been conned. In the mood for secular nouveau celtic? You won't find it here."
1,Disappointing,Not nearly up to the standards of their first CD. Includes too many sophomoric teenage love songs.
2,The author is not able to present the ideas in the simplest way.,"I was trying to read this book in details on importance sampling. It wasted me a few hours looking at the detailed mathematically formula in the corresponding section in the book without getting a clear high level picture. The convoluted examples given the section is more than necessary. Eventually, I found this series of video lecture from mathematicalmonk on youtube.If you compare the book with this series of video, I believe you will agree that this book deserves a 2 star. Technically this book may be sophisticated. But just by sampling the important sampling section and checking a few other sections in the book, I think that I can conclude fairly safely that if there is anything that a reader don't understand in the book, it is the author's fault but not the readers.[...](ML 17.5) Importance sampling - introductionand the 2 follow up videos"
5,Monte Carlo Statistical Methods (by Christian P. Robert),It is a fantastic book for Monte Carlo Methods
5,The 3rd rock of 1952,"Usually you look back at old programs like the Lone Ranger and think how hokey they were. Then you realize that you, being a kid at the time could enjoy them as they were. Then there is ""Topper"" the TV show. It was one big smoking commercial. Well I sort of counted on this happening with ""My Little Margie."" Boy was I surprised. The plots are complex for the small period of time they have to execute in. Hokey or not they had me laughing. And Price per pound, you get twelve episodes. I am working my way through for a second time. When I get tired, I will put them on the shelf and they look good in the box set."
2,Not much variety!,I just got this game and thought it was okay. It wasn't very challenging or fun. Definately for the younger age group.
4,Pleasantly suprised,"Quality of paper, binding was better than expected, and the artwork was as good or better than other Marvel books. Pretty good, in other words.The story was interesting - I am a fan of the X-men and SpiderMan books and liked the X men appearance, but liked how BP held his own against them. The political references may be above the heads of some younger readers, but added a subtle understory. That, along with the romantic tension between BP and Storm, created a pretty intriguing story."
5,Please Reprint This Book!,I think this is a great book! Simple yet very profound. Strongly recommended for anyone looking to learn and understand the basic principles of the Christian faith.
4,Excellent book,An excellent read and a great insight in to the 94 Congress. The book was in excellent condition and well worth keeping. I will definitely purchase further books from this vendor.
5,Someone finally wrote a poem about outdoor urination,"I don't like much poetry. Even the word itself is insufferably prissy. But Thomas Lynch's stuff is one of the few exceptions. For one thing, his stuff doesn't rhyme. Which is a big relief. Unfortunately, Tom is also a living testament to that sinister Catholic-priest brag about the efficacy of their brainwashing. (""Give me a kid when he's 7 hours old and he's mine for life."") Tom spends too much time boring me to tears with Catholic subject-matter and consecration-mongering.I love what Tom said about newlyweds: ""They kiss in the backseat of the limousine. Black satin and white lace they wave and smile. We gawk from the sidewalks. They are strangers to us.""They sure are."
3,It's aight,"It's ok. If you are a true eminem fan then you know all of his lyrics already, when i purchased this book i thought it really dug into the mind of this genius but it doesnt. He just tells how his life was messed up at the time in every song and some stupid stuff that was going on while he recorded each track, its really not that interesting. I am a die hard eminem fan and i didnt find this book that great. It's nice beacause it gives lyrics to some of his sick freestyles but other than that, if you really love eminem then you know everything else that is in this book and you dont need it, unless you want it like I did. I dont regret it but i have trouble recommending it to true eminem fans because it is really not necessary."
3,It was cool,I read this book the day i got it and like 70% of it is lyrics to his songs which kinda disappointed me because i wanted to read his biography (which it really isnt). Other than that It had some pretty cool pictures. It would be cheaper if youd looked up his lyrics on the internet cause thats all it is.
2,Good book if you don't want to learn anything.....,"This is basically just a ""book"" of all the song lyrics on Eminems second and third albums. Mixed in with some from his first one and some freestyles. He tells you what he was feeling and where he was when he wrote the songs, with little backstory. If you want a book that'll tell you some backstory on Eminem, don't buy this book. And for all you girls who love Em cause you think hes hot, there are pictures in it of him."
4,Eminem - Not so up close & personal...,"I am a great fan of Eminem's work. He's a lyrical master mind! I was a bit disappointed when I read this book becuase he doesn't tell much about his life in it, only his lyrics and how he thought to write some of the songs he wrote. One thing I did really enjoy was the list of songs he's created. It allowed me to download some of his stuff that I've never heard! Eminem is great, open, honest and in my opinion a true artist! This book also has some really great never before viewed photo's of Marshall. Check it out!"
4,Eminem,"bought this book for my son and he is really enjoying it, may seem like a weird way to get a kid to read but its working. He's a big fan so its getting him school credit."
2,Vanilla Ice with Turrets Syndrome,"Eminem better enjoy his 15 minutes while they last. It was a wise financial move to publish his lyrics and explanatory notes on them before he joins the ranks of Vanilla Ice and other has beens. His tunes are catchy, but so is the themesong to ""The Jetsons"". I must say the photos are appealing, and since we are living in a sub-literate culture, they are essential. This book is positive in the sense that it will appeal to his fans, a group who largely find books anathema. On the other hand, it's so sad that trees had to die for this. Couldn't people just continue to download his lyrics from the internet?"
2,Fair Book.,It's okay. I guess. There's lots of bad language and stuff like that in this book. So think before reading and buying this book.
1,Angry Blonde,"This book is disgusting, I bought it for my 14 yr. old and will not let him read it. Now I know what is wrong with this world today. I know its music and free speech, but why would people want to read or listen to this. Really, its about killing and drugs and calling girls bitches. Do people really live there lives this way. What is so cool about killing someone or using drugs or even stealing from people. Really now, there are better things to do with your life. I am not even going to send the book back, I think I will just burn it. I do not think this is creative work. It just blows my mind that all these peole write these reviews and how great it is. I am not close minded, but killing and drugs do not turn me on. So pick up your pants and start being human."
2,Re: Angry Blonde,I read this book and then I ate my macaroni and cheese. Nice job! CAW CAW CAW CAW CAW CAW CAW
4,nice,"I went and bought this book and it was what i had expected it to be, very good but nothing excellent. It provides an excellent insight into what eminem was thinking and the circumstances surrounding him as to why he decided to write the songs and the songs beginnings. It's good because this is written by eminem in his own words and through his feelings. the pictures are a nice supplement and so are the extra freestyles that are provided at the end of the book. very good and an essentiality for all Eminem fans."
3,As talented as he may be.....,"This is only for die-hard fans. Sure I like many of his songs but I'm not a big fan of his, but if you wanna see many photos and lyrics that could have already existed, maybe this is for you. If you want a true biography however, or at least on stuff he's done, try Martin Huxley's Crossing The Line book. It's got the stuff about him on that book from early expirences to the era it was published."
4,Eminem,"I had this book once then it walked away, I am glad to own it again, but this book didnt come with dust jacket I know should be with it. Its a great book if you enjoy more then Eminem's raps."
4,i was a lil disapointed,"i was disapointed to see some of my favorite songs were not included in this book. i wanted to see why he wrote some of the songs he did, i will never know, until his next book comes out. From reading this book i am able understand the way em thinks. i still love this book. if your an eminem fan u must buy this book. With this book you are able to get into em's head with him. I can understand why he wrote some of the songs he did. And this book has helped me to express my anger through a pen,i love this book, it has changed the way i think about em, Now i can understand him."
5,Glad I Bought It,"I'm so glad I got this book 4 Christmas! Not only is it a complete lyrical guide, but it tells what Em was aiming towards when he wrote each song. I loved him before I got the book, but now that I understand him better, I love him even more!"
4,Truth of Angry Blonde,"This book, Angry Bonde, is just a colorful lyrical book. I mean Eminem explain(most of them) why he made his songs, and then there is the lyric of the song in colorful pages. At the beggining there is an intro by Eminem. The songs are mostly from Marshall Mathers LP and Slim Shady LP. The songs are the following: ..., I'm Shady, ..., Rock Bottom, Cum on Everybody, My Fault, '97 Bonnie and Clyde, If I Had.., Brain Damage, Role Model, Guilty Conscience, The Kids, Marshall Mathers, Criminal, As the world Turns, Kim, Drug Ballad, The Way I Am,, Kill You, Who Knew, The Real Slim Shady, I'm Back, Greg freestyle, Any Man, murder murder, Bad Influence, ..., No one iller, low down dirty, Infinite, freestyle from Tony Touch's Power Cypha 3, 3hreeSix5ive, Weed Lacer and Pills"
5,the ultimate eminem fans book,this book is by far and away the best book to buy if you want to know how the mind of marshall mathers aka eminem ticks it tells you what he was feeling and what he was thinkin when he wrote each song and it makes you understand him a little better if you can feel where he was comin from when he wrote his songs i give this book 5 stars and will recommend it to anyone who loves eminem and his music
3,How the book is,I think this book was pretty good. This book had a lot of lyrics and why eminem wrote those songs. I really wanted it to have more about his life because i wanted to learn more. I new just about every song in the book that it had lyrics for so i kind of just sung them in my head. But all in all the book was pretty good and if you like eminem you should read it to learn a little about him and his lyrics.
5,This was such a great look at Eminem's lyrics...,"This was such a great book for any Eminem lover and anyone who hated Eminem and really needs to get the real facts on why he wrote some of the lyrics. Basically i think the book fits anyone. It has all the songs and lyrics off of the Slim Shady LP, Marshall Mathers LP, and some extra freestyles. With those lyRIcs is also why he wrote every song, and you really get to understand Eminem as himself. It also has many cool pictures. It was 148 pages long, and i read the whole thing the day i got it cause it was so interesting. I really recommend this book if you want to hear from the real sim shady. Best of all, Eminem is the author so you know you are getting the truth, and not fake ... It also has a really funny intro by Eminem. I would just like to say Angry Blonde is a good book for ANYONE! YOU RULE MARSHALL MATHERS!!"
3,"Wasn't all I expected, but was interesting, nonetheless.","I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to just anyone, but if you want to get inside Eminem's head for a brief moment and understand why he chooses the lyrics that he does, than this is the book. But that's basically all this is - his lyrics and some explanations. Honestly, I expected (and hoped for) more."
4,great book,"i loved this book because it has the lyrics to most of his songs and i like to read along as he sings the songs. it also has cool pictures in it. i am a huge eminem (slim shady, marshall mathers), and D12 fan. I love Em."
4,Great book! Much action and technology.,This was my first Dale Brown book and I intend to read many more. I would suggest this book to anyone who asks.
1,"This is the first ""thriller"" I haven't passed on to friends.","This is a badly written, badly plotted novel. The characters aren't sympathetic or heroic. There is no character development and all of the plot has to hang on the equipment of the Tin Man. The technology described here may be possible and even interesting but it cannot sustain a 400+ page thriller. Much like Tom Clancy's latest Rainbow 6 a disappointing addition to worthy previous works."
2,Barely Two Stars,Oh my. This was my first and last Dale Brown book. I was expecting something better. It took serious effort to stick with this book to the finish. The dialog made Clancy look good. So cheesy. The only redemptive value is it's pretty face-paced. Find a better way to spend your time.
4,Entertaining... bit of Techno ...,"Enjoyed the recurring of the ""Cast"" from previous books. Loved the twisted plotting of Townsend, this is one very brillant bad guy. Tin Man is wee bit Techno, sci-fi, & thriller wrapped up in a quickly moving package. Looking forward to remeeting these courageous people again."
1,This Tin Man's Heart Is Barely Beating,"I was greatly disappointed by this cartoonish effort that would have been more appropriate on Saturday mornings viewed by youngsters as they scarf down their morning cereal. Brown attempted to combine drugs, bikers, neo-nazis, military, high tech, and police and was never able to present a realistic, suspenseful plot. The story crashed and burned shortly after it began. I tried to get through it and after hours of struggle I laid it to rest after chuckling to myself that this Tin Man should have stayed in the Land of Oz."
3,nice body armor,The book had a great beginning to it and a very interesting plot. This is my first Dale Brown book. I hope I will be able to read more of his work. This book was action-packed.
1,NO!,"Dale Brown made a mistake. He should have stuck with air combat, but instea tried this foray into action. No! I like his other books, but this one I shouldn't have spent my moneyon. The best part of this book was his preview for Battle Born. I look forward to his return to his original genre in Battle Born"
1,How did the author make the best seller's list ?,"Disappointing at best. I hate wasting money, but in this particular case I can't get myself to finish reading the book.Were his previous books really best sellers ? Why ?"
1,The worst Brown i've read sofar,"Finished it in a day and it never ever catched me as did his previous books. Stick to your previous subjects, Dale.Everyone is allowed some mistakes, even writers"
2,Don't bother...,"Utter crap. It just never quite seemed to tie together in any believable way, and you were left with the feeling that there were huge gaps in the storyline. It would not take long to find another book to entertain you over the coming winter months..."
3,"A mixbag,...","This is my first Dale Brown book. I must say I like his imagination in intergrating the high-tech gadgets (including the BERP material) into this story. I like the action and the ups and downs that the main characters go through. My main critisism would be that there is too much emphasis on tough and macho talk between the brothers and the cop community in general. I feel that as a result of this ""talk"" the story itself has become a bit unrealistic."
1,awful... plain awful. Wish there was a minus Star rating,Plot doesn't hang together. Characters are one-dimensional at best. Dialogue is unrealistic. I've found Brown to be somewhat entertaining before and was really disappointed.I finally quit trying to read it and just tossed it away. Didn't even have the heart to donate it to a charitable cause.
1,The absolute worst!,"This was bad! I've read all his other books and while some of them were far-fetched, this plot, or lack of plot, was so unbelievable that it defied reality! Our heroes who are ostensibly the best our country has to offer are suddenly struck dumb and stupid and we are supposed to believe this! I was embarassed! I couldn't wait to finish this book so I could go on and read something else. Please bring back Son of the Old Dog!"
1,"If you like ""Hokey"", then read it.","I am a Dale Brown fan ! Let me get that out of the way at the start. If you are old enough to remember those old movie serials with the Hero in the aluminum suit, and the bullet-shaped aluminum helmet, then you will understand what this book is about. And there were enough scenes where someone almost gets killed only to make a miraculous escape to provide fodder for at least an 18 week run in serial form. It is no problem for this guy to be blown up, shot point blank with really largecaliber weapons, or to jump off of a building and land on the rotor blades of a flying helicopter, glance off, and get up fighting ! Even the meth cookers were super high tech. I thought I would never reach the end of this book."
1,Avoid this one,"""The Tin Man"" appears to have been thrown together at the last minute. It starts off as a decent, if formulaic thriller, then quickly deteriorates into a state of complete un-readability. The inane plotting, wooden dialogue and non-existant character development combine to form a shockingly lame final product. This is only book I've read by Dale Brown, and if he indeed does have talent, then this wretched offering must be a source of considerable embarrassment to him. Complete garbage."
1,a literary embarassment,"One of the worst examples of a thrown together, pot boiler, techno-thriller I have ever had the misfortune to read. The interesting premise, the bad guys covet a revolutionary fabric with military and economic advantages, is buried under thick layers of stilted dialogue, improbable plot twists, and one dimensional characters. I have read and enjoyed several of Mr. Brown's other books, but this is a slap dash, third rate effort that is as much an embarassment to the author as it is to his editor. Thank goodness I happened to come across this book in the library and saved myself the cost of its purchase."
1,Looking for a Dale Brown book? Avoid this one!,"I have bought and read every Brown book and loved them...they were impossible to put down. ""Tin Man"" was easy to put down! I have tried to read this book 3 times since I bought it and have yet to get through the second chapter. Thank goodness ""Battle Born"" is a return to the ""tried and true"" Dale Brown genre!"
1,Lots of books in this genre do it MUCH better.,"This absolutely has to be one of the most poorly written books I've come across in quite a while. I won't go into details which would spoil the plot, but suffice it to say the characters act like no one else on earth does, events which are just plain inane occur, and damn if the entire plot isn't a dog.One of the few books I had to hold my nose just to get through.Real lame. Avoid."
2,Bad Move.,"This was a very disappointing book. Usually, Brown's books are excellent, but this shift from his usual topic hurt the book. Badly. The only word I can use to describe it is ""hokey."""
4,"Good, but not great.","It is classic Dale Brown. Writing about hardware and operations, not political intrigue. I would recommend it to a friend."
2,The Tin Man by by Dale Brown,The book starts out okay. but goes downhill with the introduction of a dumb armored suit. if the next bhook in this series is as improbable and contrived i will no longer read Dale Brown.
3,Die Hard Sacramento,"This is a somewhat derivative tale. Part Die Hard - ruthless European terrorists enact cunning plot with lots of fake trails mixed with a bit of the movie Tuxedo with its super suit and a bit of Dirk Pitt - well funded US agency uses technology to kill bad guys.It is readable but not gripping. The US Agency involved are multiple and bewildering, county, state, military, federal, drug etc but they are not as interesting as the author makes out. They all do similar things but overlap too much and cost a heap of money. There are some good plot twists and a fair ending."
3,split personality,"This is one half of a terrific novel. The first half, a gritty no-punches-held crime drama, is dynamite as it introduces the characters and sets up the inevitable conflict, even if the science is a bit shaky in spots. Unfortunately, somewhere about the halfway point, it starts to head south, and it turns into a hybrid sci-fi/James Bond thriller totally at odds with what came before; some reviewers on this page have likened it to a comic book, and I have to admit I agree. A scientist's puppy-dog infatuation with his female boss does not help matters any, either. Still, it's a nice thrill ride if you can suspend your disbelief.NOTE: It seems those who love Brown's other books hate this one, and vice versa."
1,Lacked Credibilty. A real disappointment .,"Seems to really have stretched to weave together a series of plots, none of which held anyreal credibility. So far out that Science Fiction should be the category under which it's listed. Please save your money. It's really not worth it. It would appear that the readers who've submitted ratings didn't realize that the ""default"" is 5 stars, not one star."
2,"Hybrid between Die Hard and Robocop, not Dale Brown material","This is different from his other books. There a bit of everything, even sex and romance!! He can do better."
2,So-So RoboCop type of thriller,"Mr. Brown's book took a while to get into, then it turned into a kind of Robo Cop like tale. This book was a little too sci-fi for me, and the substance called BERP a little too far-fetched."
2,Not one of Dale Brown's Better Efforts -- so far,"Admittedly I am writing this review before finishing the book -- but if I waited I might not be able to complete this review before 2000. At some point - I am sure (and this is based on trusting the author) this will turn into a typical Brown action thriller. But so far I am completely bored with the tedious explanations of child birth, Dr. Laura advice for the lovelorn, etc. ad nauseum. It seems like Brown is trying to attract women readers at the expense of his historical and lyal audience. Maybe I'll get past another two pages tonight. Hopefully I can reutrn to give this the ususal Brown glowing review - but not so far."
2,Pretty Bad,"It's a shame. A good author prints a couple of really good books and for whatever reason ends up regurgitating poor books with little plot but guaranteed to generate revenue at a phenomenal rate. This book had very little of substance in it. Although pretty clear from the description, the plot line is a pretty wide divergence from Brown's usual fare (hi-tech military shoot-em-up) -- a direction he should not have taken.The plot was weak and predictable and the writing marginal. Like Tom Clancy, Steven King and John Grisham Dale Brown generated a few great books and now seems to have run out of ideas.Truly a shame"
3,I thought I was reading a Marvel comic,"The book was somewhat entertaining, but its not the novel you would expect from Dale Brown. He transforms Patrick McLanahan into Frank Castle. If you don't know, Frank Castle is the Punisher from Marvel Comics. The book is full of high-tech weapons, drug dealers, gun battles, biker gangs, and a man obsessed with revenge. I believe that fans of the Marvel Comic will find a lot to like about this book, but true Dale Brown fans will pray that he switches back to the type of novels we have come to expect and enjoy."
2,Not Up To Par,"I truly hope this was a blip on an otherwise great writing career. This book is a departure from Dale's normally high standard, and also from his normal topic - the Air force and aviation technology, which I hope will not be repeated.I found much of this book hard to believe, and the rest just plain wrong. The key character, Patrick McLanahan, just didn't seem to act like the Patrick McLanahan we have come to know and love. One minute, the BERP armour (armor for the Americans) makes him go mad and try to kill his friends, the next it's just giving him nasty electric shocks, and he's in full control.Dale please go back to the military novels, of which you are an undoubted master.Prospective readers, please don't judge the author by this book, it is not representative.Cheers, Dan"
2,A disappointment,"I don't find the actions of either side to be those of individuals of the intelligence they are portrayed as having. Furthermore, his blatant disregard for the realities of armor in the protection offered by his BERP are a continuing disruption to the reader whose sees it's impossibility. Even if it works as described, he would have died at least twice."
2,A Wannabe trying very hard in other genre,"I found this novel quite repulsive and tasteless. There is no need to detail the process of making drugs unless you're blindly grasping the faith of freedom of speech. Making an announcement in the very beginning advising readers not trying to make the deadly drug, but almost provided the necessary ingredients, piles of raw materials copied from his narcotic retiree wife, adding more stereotyped but on the other hand, highly unlikely plot and scenario derived and misinterpretated from some current news or some whimsical ideas provided by some wannabe writers from the readers through the emails, have become a pathetic mode of Brown's recent books. Even worse, some totally unbelievable hero obviously originated and combined from some comic and sci-fi books--the rocketeer+shadow(or ghost?)+spiderman+whatever you name it. Not quite a good way to bind up a so-called thriller."
1,A disappointment!,"I was very disappointed in this book. The beginning of the story is intriguing, with some character development. However, as the book progresses I have the impression that Dale Brown's publisher called to say he had two days to finish the remainder of the book. The last half is vague, undefined, and sans characters that you can clearly envision or care about."
2,Not up to authors usual standards.,"This book was very disappointing to me in its lack of depth and vague plot machinations. I am used to a much higher standard being met by this author. If he is not going to do his homework, I would suggest that he stick to B52's and the Air Force. He obviously knows enough about those subjects to be convincing. The ""authors name"" sold me this one but I will definitely look closer at his future offerings."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Poor men's iron men come back from mission with a body bagged brother.A covert mission in power armour suits? Sounds pretty unlikely, or cool comic stuff, doesn't it? Pretty much. So the new toy for these miltiary technology wunderkinds proves too irresistable to keep off for long. So, they do what they do best, at least the head guy. Blow crap up, and get family members dead. Technothriller/mundane sf/weapons porn sort of stuff, but certainly ok if you are after that sort of book."
2,"An OK-read, but not unforgetable","I am a big fan of Dale Brown's action-packed, aviation-focused novels. As such, I decided to venture out of the aviation world for once, carefully following Brown's lead through his ""Tin Man"" novel.The action is OK, the theme is interesting. But there are no aircraft in it! Plus, the science side of the explanations Brown gives of the technology behind the supermen-like powers is both weak and hardly credible at all... In fact, the whole book reads more like a ""common"" police action book with a soft science-fiction edge than the mix of military aviation, armrest-grabbing novels I am used to reading from Brown."
2,Disappointing,"The difficulty in starting with a top first effort is that following efforts have much to live up to. Unfortunately 'Tin Man' doesn't.Although many of the same characters appear, introduction of new characters gives them a limited dimension in Tin Man. The limited dimension limited the enjoyment and buy in for me. I'd looked forward to this, I less sure about the next.This tin man should have stayed in Oz."
2,Non-realistic and shallow,"I was disappointed with this book. Did no one else seem to notice that the execution of the drug gangs has NO connection to the terrorists final mission? This book was thrown together, with little attention to content."
2,"Mr. Brown, go back to writing about flying and dying.",I've really enjoyed Dale Brown's previous books but this one is not in the same category. He used the same names as those of characters in previous books but they weren't the same people. I was really disappointed in it.
1,Don't listen to that review about Mos...,"That is the worst way to go about reviewing a Cd: by comparing to something completely different, a la Mos' ""The New Danger.""Honestly, the reviews are supposed to be about Speech's crappy CD, not how you feel it's superior to another CD and how you feel the artist wish he could have a CD like that. If that's how you review CD, books, etc, then step away from the keyboard.You have no way of knowing if Mos wanted to make a CD like this one."
4,A near miss.,"Rothbard argues like a great trial lawyer. I was reminded of Bugliosi's book on the OJ trial more than any of the philosophical books on ethics I have read. I much prefer the clarity of Rothbard's writing to the rambling and gratuitous use of logical argot in Nozick. At the same time, I think Libertarianism needs a better approach to ethics to counteract the work of scholars like Rawls, who,following Kant's Metaphysics Of Morals, argues pursuasively for a more collectivist view. Fortunately or unfortunately, I think Ayn Rand was closer to the the mark with her ethics as expressed in Atlas Shrugged and Capitalism the Unknown Ideal. It is sad that more critical approaches to objectivist ethics have not been attempted by non-devotees. Still, the discussion of property rights as fundamental is priceless, and should be required reading for congressional staffers."
5,Best of The Best,This is an essential read for anyone who wants to understand liberty at its most fundamental levels. Does NOT get bogged down in abstract concepts and flighty philosophical language. Instead this text delivers clear and logical explanations. I would recommend this at the top of the list.
1,"Poor Work, From a Brilliant Author","This was the first work of Rothbard's that I found to be highly displeasing. It is a mix of poor philosophy and legal construction. While the author is a brilliant economists, one of the best in the twentieth century, this work on philosophy takes away from his overarching beliefs as put forth in his other writing. Don't read this for an argument on natural rights. He admits that is not his purpose. Don't read this for a picture of a legal system in a free society (see Benson- Enterprise of Law). Instead, go to the best defense of Anarchy, which is Rothbard's ""For A New Liberty"". The only reason to read this is if you want to be familiar with a book that is referenced ubiquitously by Austrian sheep."
4,Leon Errol comedy,I enjoyed the clean comedy from another era. I grew up seeing this type of comedy between main films at the neiborhood movie theatre.
1,for fanatics,"Never had a guide book as boring as this one. The selection of summits is by the highest point in any county in Colorado, which includes cow pastures, and a ""suburban street in residential southwest Denver - a short walk from side street parking requiring 5 feet elevation gain"". For any other peaks, consult any of the other guidebooks."
3,Rather flimsy,"I love the style of this sandal. I do not think it would be worth the original price and barely the SALE PRICE. It is so very thin and flimsy, it is almost like walking on cardboard. Similar style and leather sandals in K-Mart (Also Made in India) at Approx. $15.00 were better constructed."
1,A bit flimsy,The style of the sandal is very lovely. The sole is rather thin and a bit flimsy. K-Mart sold sandals Made in India and the soles were much sturdier. The fit is a bit big. All in all I am enjoying my sandal by Naughty Monkey.
5,Entertaining and Informative,"This is a great book for anyone who likes biographies, politics, or who likes to tick off authority figures. Gatewood's stories are humorous and amusing, and his politics are meticulously researched.He is definitley a hometown celebrity, and hopefully this book will help him be recognized on a more national level!GATEWOOD FOR PRESIDENT!!"
3,Good easy read,"Gatewood writes well enough to make this book easy to read and get caught up in but his message is lessened by his own personal perspectives and at points, is less about his life and more about marijuana. His basic character is right on but I disagree with his argument. This book is all about how wonderful pot is and I learned much more than I already knew; however, I am contrary to his idea of using hemp as another means by which the government can fleece its population of its wealth. Marijuana should be legal but not taxed and regulated.Overall, I could have done without all the drum beating about pot. I was looking more for constitutional standings and his life in general. It is a good book and worth reading but I recommend the paper back version, this is not one to save and adorn your bookshelf with."
5,"A fantastic ""playground""","I bought this train table this Christmas for ""Grandma's House"" Now that the train set is here, my Grandson hasn't left willingly. This wonderful play table has provided many hours of imaginative play for all in my family, from my 5 year old Grandson to Grandpa. Before the holidays were over I had purchased 4 train sets here on Amazon, now they have more ways to play than I ever imagined.Jenny Ryan"
2,a missed opportunity,"As much as I like Jerry Beck I wish he hadn't sold himself out with this overly sanitized ""Spike and Mike approved"" version of their festival's history. Here we just get an extended regurgitation of Spike and Mike's self glorifying press release along with many pretty photographs. I used to attend this festival in my college days and have friends who've worked behind the scenes, so I really wished this book showed some actual guts. Where's the sex and the drugs and the seedy backstage goings-on at the festival? Why is there no mention of the festival's universal stunning decline in quality in recent years? Why is there no accounting for all the animators that allegedly refuse to submit work to, much less even speak to, this festival anymore? That's the book I'm still waiting to read! If you're a casual fan not interested in animation history and just want to look at pictures, I guess this book would be for you though."
5,different and delightful,"When my daughter helped pick these out for her sister, I had to promise that I'd buy a pair for her on her own birthday. They are every bit as pretty and festive as pictured, and different from what you can usually find. 'Candy' jade is a good description - all the swirls and lovely anticipation of old time penny candy. Plus this is a good company to buy from - everything arrives with its own box, in great condition, with very quick delivery."
5,"Gorgeous, stunning, beautiful !!!","The young lady I gave this pair of earrings to got loads of compliments the first day she wore them; and she wears them constantly now. I don't know how this company tools glass so intricately, but the glass is stunningly beautiful and obviously created by artisans not craft people."
3,Picture Not Quite Accurate,OK earings for the price but the ones I received were an odd shade of green. Be careful if you are expecting a pink pair of earings. Photo implies they are pink but there was only a small amount of pink in the set I recieved and the combination of those colors made the earrings look a little cheap.
5,Gorgeous,"For the price this earrings are more that I could even expect, they are elegant and beautiful. A perfect present for mother's Day plus they arrive in three days after I ordered them."
5,Way Cute,These earrings came carefully packet to ensure they would not be damaged. The color is exactly like to picture. Very Pretty and they will not dissappoint. Very happy with them!
4,"""Jackass"" is always great, but they've left out the BEST SKIT (3.5 stars)","Where is the ""SELF-DEFENSE PRODUCTS DEMONSTRATION""?That's the one in which Johnny Knoxville subjects himself to pepper spray, an electrified cattle prod and taser darts. That's the first ""Jackass"" sketch I saw and it's hilarious, still one of my favorites.When Vol. 2-3 came out, I was hoping it would be on one of those.It wasn't.So, I thought, surely it'll be on Vol. 1.It's not.Still, there are over 100 chapters here and some really good sketches:""Poo Cocktail,"" ""Johnny Coxville,"" ""BMX Joust,"" ""Sumo Wrestling,"" ""Daddy and Baby (1-3),"" ""The Goldfish,"" ""50 Egg Challenge,"" ""Egg Nog Challenge,"" ""Landskiing"" (with Bam Margera doing one of the best falls of the series); ""Beekini,"" ""Bam Beating Phil for a Day,"" ""Prostitute Boat Race,"" ""Skunk,"" ""Steve-O Shot Glass"" and the extremely funny ""Oklahoma,"" in which Preston gets whipped by dominatrices.This is a good set but the one scene I bought it to have isn't on here. Alas."
3,Heavily censored commentary.,"and the so-called ""uncensored"" commentary which in theory spans the first 59 sketches is so heavily censored and bleeped that it is almost unlistenable. I suspect it is censored for legal rather than language reasons as it seemed that they were talking about private matters or people who were not there.Still calling the commentary ""uncensored"" is a lie."
5,"Great read about hiking those ""boutique"" peaks.","This is a great collection of hikes and stories that prove once again that 4000 footers are not the only adventures waiting to be had. New Yorkers are so fortunate to have so many wild and unspoiled places to get away from it all. If you like hiking for the sake of hiking (or even if your ""counting"" peaks) this is a fun book. Meeting people along the trail is always adventurous and filled with suprises. Those shared experiences are an essential part of these stories. It makes me want to grease up my boots, grab Gary's book, and get out there."
4,Grandma pleaser,"My grandparents are hardcore lawn and plant maintenance people. Grandma said she wanted new shears for Christmas because her old ones were pretty much destroyed. These are a little expensive, but any bought for less fall apart. They are truly the best in the business. Not much you can do to destroy these except melt them with thermite."
2,An unpleasant surprise,"It wasn't clear when I ordered this product that it is designed as a sublingual and is flavored with peppermint. Unfortunately, for some people peppermint relaxes the valve at the top of the stomach that keeps food from backing up the esophagus. I knew this to be an occasional problem for me, but decided to try a tablet anyway. Bad idea. Severe heartburn lasted for hours. If you have a problem with reflux, you might want to try another kind of CoQ10."
1,The White Devil,"Why is it I can't watch a movie now days about a black man & woman recording music without whitey messing it all up? Seriously yo, Ebony Flowers was like tight and that Cedric was a dawg yo until Lonnie Caucasian shows up and ruins it all. Now I know not all white folk worship Satan, but most of them do and that's what makes this a bad film. As matter of fact I haven't even finished the movie yet and I already know what's gonna happen... Look! Brother has a bee hive on his head! And what's up with Ebony's foot? It's like a frostbitten Sasquatch foot. This movie would have been given a better rating if wasn't for all them crackers summoning demons and such. Does Amazon sell Sasquatch foots?I was right! In comes ole pasty face with a pentagon painted in on his head. Nasty!"
4,Great Score by Charlie Clouser,"The Charlie Clouser songs are really well constructed. If you've seen the movie they will remind you of their scenes. Some do sound like nine inch nails instrumentals. I wish there was a new nine inch nails song on here or at least a remix. None of the tracks are bad.1. Sturm - Front Line Assembly2. Hello, Adam - Charlie Clouser3. Bite The Hand That Bleeds - Fear Factory4. Last I Heard - Charlie Clouser5. Action - Enemy6. Reverse Beartrap - Charlie Clouser7. You Make Me Feel So Dead - Pitbull Daycare8. X Marks The Spot - Charlie Clouser9. Wonderful World - Psycho Pumps10. Cigarette - Charlie Clouser11. We're Out Of Time - Charlie Clouser12. F**k This S*** - Charlie Clouser13. Hello Zepp - Charlie Clouser14. Zepp Overature - Charlie Clouser"
4,one of the better soundtracks,"This soundtrack consists of music performed by NIN's Charlie Clouser, and other various artists. Most of the songs are dark, catchy, and quite memorable. Some of the Clouser cuts sound somewhat NINish but sink into orchestrated tunes that could be mistaken for any other movie score composer. Overall, the whole cd is great, esp the fear factory song and the song by Pitbull Daycare(whom I had never heard of until purchasing this disc). This soundtrack is definitely worth buying unlike some...where there is only a few good songs, and most of the songs are already out on cd's anyway. So give this one a chance, you wont regret it if you like gothic, industrial, rock, or metal."
5,Hurray for the Three Mesquiteers!,"Again a knife-sharp new release with The Three Mesquiteers played by John Wayne, Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan and Max Terhune. Directed by here-and-there-and-everywhere George Sherman one is sure to get fighting, riding and shooting like a b-western always should be. The dialog is witty and the dear reliable co-actors are highly represented. Among others John Merton, Ethan Laidlaw and always elegant Ted Adams. An ape played by a man in a bad gorilla suit, Terhune's dummy ""Elmer"" and Terhune suddenly driving around in some caterpillar vehicle is silly but let it be. Three Texas Steers is great fun and action."
1,This Camera Sucks,This is not worth the money that I paid for it. The screen is tiny and you can't zoom in/out. You can't even take picture while you're outside at night because it won't show up. Its the worse camera I've ever had.
4,Best and down to earth available in this price range,"The only reason I dont give 5 stars is the lack of models without William Gates Keys, no choice of color, USB hub is only 2-port.I was looking for a basic KB with USB hub usable for gaming, and I found it in this one, it was betweem thisone and a $150 keyboard, I tried this one first and after removing the left side Windows button I am very happy with it.It is a step up from the cheapest Key Tronic, nice touch, good warranty, good weight, good key placement and accuracy, built in USB hub, no nik-nak buttons and other bull."
5,Amazing album,I have been to many of the regions of the world that songs in this album are about. If you close your eyes and listen it is like being there. The artist has done an amazing job capturing the essence of the regions! Very relaxing and intriguingWork
2,My son has bruises!!!!!,We bought this when my son turned 5 months old. He loves it and can walk back and forth and spin around but unfortunately he has gottem bruises from the toy. No pinched fingers or toes yet but there is an indent in the front of the seat under the cloth and my son has gotten a horrible bruise on his chest from leaning forward to reach toys. The bruise is so bad that there is a hard lump underneath it. I freaked out when I saw it and took him to the doctors because I had no idea what caused it until I realized that the indent is in the exact spot as his bruise. It upsets me because he really does love the toy so I have been putting a small pillow there to cushion his chest. I am however concerned about the pinching now.
5,My Twin Boys Love the Step and Play Piano,"I purchased the piano when my sons were 6-months old because they seemed bored with their bouncer and boppy. I was so suprised at how quickly they got used to their new toy and at how quickly they seemed to be able to do more with their bodies. I truly think that because of the piano's ability to allow the babies to turn around and move back and forth, it really moved them ahead developmentally. They LOVE this item and never seem to get enough of it. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the product because in my mind it is wonderful."
5,As close to perfect as a toy can be!,"We bought this for our four month old and he absolutely loves it. We put him in it 3 times a day, around 15 minutes each time. Today, much to my amazement, he actually scooted himself from one side to the other when I coaxed him to ""come to mommy"". So far, I can't think of a single complaint I could make about the Step and Play Piano. I would recommend this toy to anyone!"
3,OK TOY,I bought this for my nephew when he was about 9 months old. I agree the sit should be adjustable. He is now 16 months old and we use this toy to keep him contained and entertained when we need to do things around the house. I was disappointed because I thought this would help him walk sooner but it did not.
2,Disinterested,"I purchased this item when my daughter was 3 months old. At first she would sit there and reach out for the toys, it seemed like she enjoyed the music she was creating as well as the challenge that the toys created. Now that she is seven months old, she can walk in it, turn her seat around and all the toys are at her reach. But she is more interested in her 20 dollar walker then she is this toy, which with taxes ran me close to 100 dollars. Bottom line is that it is just not worth the money, and the toys are really not interesting for a baby over 6 months. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buy a cheaper stationary entertainer and your wallet wont hurt so bad when baby prefers another toy."
4,GREAT FUN,"My daughter just started to use this toy, she is 4+ months old. She can't quite reach the keys in front of her, but she can reach the keys with her feet. She smiles when she is using this toy. She loves the music and lights. As she gets older, I'm sure she will enjoy it even more.Be prepared, it is a large toy, and takes up some space; but it's a great toy."
3,Good product but expected more...,"My 4 month old son received this product as a gift for Christmas, it does entertain him for a little while but he tends to get frustrated often because he cannot reach the toys and since he is teething he wants something to chew on and this product doesn't have any teethers attached which I know my baby would have loved. Instead it has all really hard toys that my baby hurts himself with when he tries to play with them. I suggest that if your looking for something to really entertain your baby then I would look at one of the saucers that come with soft teethers, my son loves playing with the one at his cousin's house."
4,LOVE THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!,"This toy was great for my son. He started playing with this toy at 3 months and its built to grow with him. This toy is durable, fun, and educational. Worth every penny."
4,9 mos of use so far!!!,"We bought this toy for may son at three months old. He liked to sit and play with the keys in front of him. After a little while, he learned how to slide from end to end and then how to turn around. When he learned to stand up we took the seat out and it was a safe and fun place for him to practice his standing and have fun with the keys under his feet. When he started taking steps, he liked to hold on and walk back and forth and practice turning around. At nine mos. he started walking and still he would go over to this toy and play in it every day. I can say that he has LITERALLY played with this toy at least once every day from 3 months old until now ( he just turned a year.) He has tons of toys and this is by far the best one we have ever gotten. We also have a play group and all his friends run for this one too! It's well worth the money and provides MONTHS of entertainment for your baby, who we all know we're lucky to keep entertained for five minutes!"
4,Its great,I really liked this toy and i knew my daughter would she did and then when she was moving she smashed her fingers thats the only reason i dont like it we took the seat out when she started to crawl and she loves it its a great toy!she sits in it while i cook shes only 5 months!
4,Loads of fun for my son,"We just received this product from my sister in law as a gift. My younger sister put it together in about 20 minutes (she's 17 and doesn't read directions well), ignoring the pages that stated permanent assembly. We have a small apartment, but have found a corner that this fits well in. My son, 4 months, loves to push the pedals with his feet, which he stretches to reach (he's a short baby). He loves the lights and music. He hasn't yet learned how to move the seat, but we move him from one side to the other and he enjoys everything. There is a volume control which is also a plus. I am glad to know this is a toy he will grow with. You may even find yourself humming or singing along to the music and enjoying this toy as much as a child."
5,Greatest [money] spent ever!,"This is the greatest toy we ever bought for our son. From 3 months of age, he loved this piano. He is now 7 months old, and still spends at least 2 hours a day in this. Loves walking back and forth and playing with everything on the piano. Other kids who come over love it too! Highly, highly recommended. We bought it because he can still use it when he starts walking, unlike most saucers."
5,Great Toy!!!,"My 4 month old LOVES this toy!! She'll just sit in it and pound the bottom keys all the time. She hasn't yet figured out the top keys, but she likes looking at the lights. Also, the little rattles on each side are great too. She loves things that make noises. Overall, I think it's fantastic."
1,PLEASE READ FOR YOUR CHILDS SAFETY,"Dear Parents,I got this toy for my 3 month old daughter, and she loved it. But the first time I took her out of it she started screaming in pain, because the buckle underneath the seat scratched her leg. It it gave her a dark blue welt, and the next day it turned into a bruise. After that I still kept the toy, I just would take her out very carefully. About two weeks later she was in it walking back and forth. When she started screaming again, her thumb got stuck in a tiny space where the seat slids from side to side. Immediately her whole thumb and lower palm was bright red and swollen. She didn't stop screeming and crying for about 30 minutes. So before you think about buying this toy, please think about what happened to my daughter. I know, that no parent wants their babies first excruciating pain to be caused by a toy they bought them."
2,So sad to see it go!,"Sadly, today the UPS man came to pick up our piano to return it to Fisher-Price. My daughter (9months) has LOVED it since she was 4 months old, however twice in one week she pinced her hand. At first we thought it was a freak accident, but the second time I was standing right there--that is how quickly and easily it happens. (As the baby gets older they are able to propel the seat more quickly, thus running over hands that are on the keyboard) The toy is great but the injuries (bruised hands) was enough to send it back. Hopefully Fisher-Price will redesign the product to prevent injuries...in the meantime mommies and daddies beware!"
3,Sounds junky,"I don't know, maybe my babe is weird, but this thing just makes so much damn noise it annoys everyone including my daughter. She's 4.5 months, and her feet touch the foot pedals, but it seems like this thing just makes so much constant noise, she can't figure out what's what. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the noises this thing makes and I hate the way it sounds. Its very electronic sounding, not at all pleasing to the ears. I'm going to return it tommorrow and try to pick up the Evenflo exersaucer."
3,good but not for the newborn,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas. The concept seemed great, so I forked out the money to buy it. Christmas day we assembled it and my daughter, at 3 months old, could not reach anything, the keys on the floor nor the activities above. Now she's 4 1/2 months and barely reach the top keys and toys. She does like looking at the lights and attempts to reach them. For my 2 year old girl, she loves it. She's the one who keeps my newborn entertained."

So before you think about buying this toy, please think about what happened to my daughter. I know, that no parent wants their babies first excruciating pain to be caused by a toy they purchased."
3,Please read,"I bought this toy after calling Fisher-Price and decided it was a great toy. I have had this toy for a few months, and loved it. That was until my son received scratches across his upper leg by the plastic circle that keeps the cloth seat in place. The plastic has very sharp pieces around it. I have recently looked back at recent reviews and noticed other people explaining the same thing. I have called Fisher-Price and informed them of this problem and they said "" No one else has called about this piano! "" . So I just want to say if you have a problem with this product or others injurying your child please contact the company or CPSC, as soon as possible that way they can stop and fix the problem. Thank you."
4,be smart and get this item,This truly is the best toy ever created! My daughter loves it so much. Please do yourself a favor and invest on this item.
4,Sanai Enjoys This Toy,My 4 1/2 month Sanai enjoys this toy. I love watching her play.She smiles everytime she hears the beautiful noise she is making. I very glad we purchased this for her. She is moving around a little not that much. She has to get use to her new toy. I can't wait until she able to move all around. I know she will enjoy. Her two sisters(Essontrel and Christol)plays with her and she loves that. This is worth the money because it does alot of stuff and it grows with your child.
2,Not a great investment,"My son played with this toy over Christmas and it just didn't seem to hold his attention the way his 3way entertainer does. He only played with the purple ball toy, and both my husband and I were disappointed that the piano keys you walk on don't light up themselves. That would be more fun than stepping with your feet and seeing lights and hearing music on top. We tried this toy and my sister in law's and we won't be buying it for ourselves."
3,big and boring!,"My son wasn't thrilled by this product, not to mention it is HUGE! He would play in it for about 5 minutes, then get bored and want to come out. We've had it for over a year now, and its been collecting dust ad taking up space in his room. All together I would say he's played with it for about an hour. Buy a cardboard box instead."
5,Step & Play Piano,I'm a teacher & I bought this for my grandson. He loves it. I think it is one of the best toys I've ever bought.
1,BE VERY CAREFUL - THIS PRODUCT WILL PINCH YOUR LITTLE ONE!!!,"I JUST RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AS AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY 5 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT AT FIRST...THEN WITHIN MINUTES SHE SCREAMED AND CRIED OUT IN PAIN. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN I SAW THE PALM OF HER HAND WAS BADLY BRUISED. I THOUGHT MAYBE THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT SO I LET HER PLAY IN IT AGAIN. THIS TIME I WAS WATCHING VERY CLOSELY AND SAW IT HAPPEN TO THE SAME HAND. I FELT TERRIBLE!!!! I AM TRYING TO GET THIS PRODUCT RECALLED SO IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR LITTLE ONE, PLEASE CALL FISHER PRICE AT 1-888-253-4303 AMD REPORT IT...THANKS!!!!"
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this toy with a lot of entusiasm and interest. I also expected my daughter will learn to walk comfortably in this toy. She stopped the tiny steps which she used to do before I bought this toy. I bought this toy for her when she is 5. now she is 6 and lost interest in it. Also, her feet are reaching the bottom of the toy so comforatbly, she wont move from side to side as they show in the picture on the box. Coming to the educational value, there is nothing much to earn from this toy(this I learned after buying this toy). sometimes, she is stuck inside the seat and is crying when I am taking her out of it. The only thing I can say is $89 is tooooooo much money for this toy."
2,Watch OUT,"I bought the step and play for my daughter when she was 7 months old. She enjoyed it for the most part. After using it for about a month my daughter pinched the palm of her hand on the side of the sliding seat. I continued on putting her in to play and it happened again. I have had this entertainer for 2 months now and I'm not able to return it to the store because I do not have the box it came in. I called Fisher-Price to report the problem and they were very helpful, they will be sending we a refund check in the mail."
1,Baby was injured TWICE! CAUTION!!!,My 6 month old has been injured twice with this toy. He has gotten his finger and his hand stuck & pinched between the yellow sliding seat and the white base. I have informed fisher price. They told me I have to go out and buy a box for it and they will have UPS pick it up and reimburse my money for the toy. Is that enough for my baby's pain & suffering? And this isn't the first time. There are numerous reviews here with this complaint. When are they going to fix it or take it off the market? I've filed a complaint with the Consumer Product Safety Commission also. Please use caution! I've never heard my baby scream so loudly in pain.
1,BAD Customer Service,"There was a manufacturing defect that prevented me from assembling the toy. The customer service girl on the phone confirmed that when I called Fisher Price. Unfortunately, they didn't seem to care that it was their responsibility, and said I had to pay to send it in and then they would send me a new one. AND it would take up to a month to get a new one. My baby is ready for the toy now. She outgrows things so fast, it doesn't make sense for me to wait a month because Fisher Price made a mistake. Luckily, I found a Babies R Us store with one in stock. I just drove a long way and exchanged the defective one. I hope this one doesn't have the same problem."
3,Warning: Not Height Adjustable,"This seems like a great product; however, looking at the legs it appears that it would be easy enough for the manufacturer to put notches in the legs to make it height adjustable for those taller or shorter babies, but it is not. Very disappointing. Otherwise seems like a great product."
4,We love it!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months old. She loved it from the start, and was quickly playing with all the toys. We removed the seat when she was 9 months old, she crawled through first and is now using it to pull up and stand. The toy is stable and still interests her now that she is 11 months.Definitely worth the extra $10 or so more than other exersaucer type toys."
3,Better for a child over 7-8 months old,My 7 month old daughter is just now growing into this. Before now she was not able to reach and touch any of the activity items on it because her arms were not long enough. Keep in mind that this does not allow your child to bounce. I would have preferred an Exersaucer if I could do it over again. I am sure she will enjoy this one more as she grows and can move the seat forward and back and turn on her own and realizes that the movement of her feet makes the piano sounds. Right now she's oblivious.
4,"Sleek look, affordable price","I bought this watch for my husband back in August, 2005. When we first got it, we spend a lot of time trying to set the time on it. We finally figured out that the time setting peg unscrews out, instead of just pulling out. Once we got past that, and my husband had it resized at the Watch Station (for $2), it was great. It is a really attractive watch, that has so far functioned well, and it is lightweight. No problems, a good buy for the price."
1,Fraudulent Advertising,"The picture shows the hosel clips that keep the cover on. This product does not come with hosel clips and the covers come off constantly. I bought a set of Face Savers Plus club covers a few years back and wanted another set. Apparently, ""Face Savers Plus"" is not copyrighted, since it looks like I bought these that were made by Pro Active Sports - which do have the hosel clips. I've been cheated!"
2,Lost 2 in my first round of 18,"Have a gorgeous set of Taylormade R7 CGB's I wanted to keep looking nice. These things fall off if the wind blows the wrong way and the lanyard does nothing for you. After my unfortunate waste of money with these I did a lot of looking and finally ended up getting the ClubGlove Gloveskin in Standard size and couldn't be happier. If you get these good luck keeping them on your clubs! I plan on giving the ones I have left to a friend who has some clubs he got for free, maybe he can use them, that is until they fall off."
2,Disappointed,"I bought these about a month ago for my set of ping zing irons. They don't fit very good at all. They claim that the hosel lock keeps the covers from falling off. That's not the case, especially if you own ping zing irons. I know! Also, I personally thought the were quit bulkly! The only thing I can say positive about these covers is they seem to protect your irons good."
1,useless products,"I bought the golf iron headcovers to protect my new irons. The headcovers do not fulfil the description i.e they do not stay on the irons and therefore offer no protection. I have joined them together in pairs using the connectors provided and find they fall off in pairs and I have lost a pair already.If I had not removed them from the packaging and disposed of it I would immediately return them and demand a refund.As it is I find I have no recourse though I would like to do something about this.I DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO FIND ANYWHERE I CAN REGISTER A FORMAL COMPLAINT, THESE ITEMS ARE NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE"
1,Very Poor Head Covers,"I had the same experience as some others have indicated here. The covers barely stay on, they fall off often when you just put the club back in the bag. When I get home and take the bag out of the car, several have fallen off. I can't even believe someone put them on the market! Frankly its partly my fault as I could kind of tell by looking at them through the plastic package at the store that they were not of high quality...but the other four brands were sold out...(now I know why!). So, I'm on vacation but when I get back I'll be back hunting for other ones. Also, they don't include a Lob Wedge cover..so it is uncovered in the bag."
2,"No ""hosel locks,"" as advertised","These covers would be fine, if they would stay on the clubs, but they won't. The ""hosel locks"" that are in the description and the picture DO NOT come with the covers. Don't waste your money."
1,Slim but unreliable,"I bought a Visor Edge in June, and loved it. It is slick, slim and easy to use, with enough upgrades on the Deluxe I've had for an age to make it worthwhile - or so I thought.In Novemeber it died. No explanation, just died and wiped all data. So I ring Handspring and get a replacement. This didn't even give me the chance to start playing with it - it was doa. I'm now awaiting my third one.Luckily I had a back-up module, and use it regularly as I may not be near a hotsynch station as often as my paranoia now requires. And where am I using this data? I'm back on the trusty Deluxe!! It's a shame - I liked the look of the Edge a lot..."
1,Guess what? You can't upgrade the OS.,"Handspring has a built in problem with all of there handhelds, they put in some cool features, and even offeres it at a resonable price. The main problem stems from the fact that you can't upgrade the OS, you are stuck with what was delivered, and if you would want to upgrade you will have to buy a new handspring that offers the latest."
1,problem with delivery,I ordered this item some time ago-was chargesd for it and havenever received it.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"The only way we can stop stupid marketing gimics (like ""price too low to display"") is to not buy items so advertised. Is is good service to make it harder for the customer to see what an item costs? It only makes finding the best price all the harder. Why should anyone patronize a company staffed with such marketing jerks?"
4,Great first Handheld,"My Visor Edge is my first handheld and I love it. I was an experienced user of Outlook and regularly printed out my address book and calendar -- now I don't need to. It is easy to use (I find the stylus simple to remove contrary to other people) and it is pretty. More importantly I actually use it. I just read the book ""Piloting Palm : The Inside Story Of Palm, Handspring, And The Birth Of The Billion-Dollar Handheld Industry by Andrea Butter & David Pogue and it gave me insight into the challenges of designing such a useful thing. If you love to read and love your handheld, I recommend the book. And I recommend the Visor Edge. In terms of software for it, the best one I've found is SplashMoney which is more sophisticated than the ""expense"" program supplied by handspring. SplashMoney from SplashData lets you enter information and it is transferred into your Quicken program. Saves a lot of going through receipts."
1,Unreliable -- Don't Buy It,"I'm a long-time Palm user (love 'em), and liked the looks and feel of the Visor Edge. Unfortunately, recharging the battery has been a problem, and [money] is too much to pay for a disposable handheld that works for two weeks. I had to perform a hard reset to get it to charge the day I brought it home, and when I set it up for Mom as a gift nothing, I mean nothing, would get it to charge. Soft reset, hard reset, even an in-the-cradle reset, nothing works. ... Quality control just seems to be real problem for Handspring. I won't be buying another one. Getting Mom a Smartphone!"
4,You can never be too thin,"I have never owned a Palm device before because I never thought that it could replace a cheap, reliable paper datebook. But the prices have come down so much, I couldn't resist. I love it, and I find myself loading it up with much more than appointments and contacts. I'm quickly becoming one of those people who couldn't live without it. The Visor Edge is thin, light, and stunning. I made a great choice."
1,Must still be working the bugs out,"I'm on my fourth one, and I'm about to demand my money back. Following is a summary of my experience with the Edge so far:Edge #1: dead on arrival Edge #2: backlight didn't work Edge #3: screws fell out Edge #4: gets hung up when synchronizing date bookEnough said."
3,Sleek and fashionable but question its value,"Pro's: Sleek metallic housing. Small form design uses good materials and has excellent ""fit and finish"". This is the BMW of PDA's! Processor speed good, keeps applications moving along just fine.Holding the EDGE in your hand, you know this is a well made product. Big Easy to read screen.Quality stylus really adds to the PDA experience. Fits in my pocket so easily. LiOn battery good feature.Cons: The unit I received operates fine by itself; but having major problems Hot-synching with my laptop. This may leave me no choice but to return it.Battery life not what I expected. What happens when I need to replace LiOn? Send it to a service center? Buy a new one! Yikes.Had to purchase additional software to get the functionality of a comparable Palm unit, this added an additional [money].Accessories hard to find."
3,Warning - sharp Edge can cut you off from your desktop data!,"Upon first glance, this is a winner. It is sleek, it is solid, it has a great B&W; screen and a weighted stylus, it is rechargeable, has an integrated cover, has enhanced applications and comes with a blazing USB syncronization cradle.So what's wrong?The major problem seems to be a well documented history of hotsync problems. Mine occured approximately 28 days after purchase. There was no way to correct this. I reinstalled the software on three different workstations, performed numerous soft resets, subsequent hard resets, cursed, screamed, cried and went into denial. Finally acceptance set in and I realized that I was no longer ""syncronizable"". Packed it up and sent it back. Thank God for Amazon."
5,Still LOVE it....AFTER ALMOST 7 YEARS!!!!,"Seriously, I have owned mine for at least 7 years....it might beven be closer to eight. It has never once crashed, lost data, slowed down....the battery is the orignal, the screen is still clear - even with almost 8 years of tapping and scratching - and it has alsways remained quick and speedy. The Visor Edge (mine was red) has brought sanity to my life without adding clunky programs and other gadgets. Plus, after nearly 8 years, the metal cover is still perfectly intact, except for one small scartch about 1/4 an inch long. Considering I am a very clumsy person and have dropped it numerous times, the machine is still almost new looking. The metal case has been amazing durable!!! If you can still find.......it is WORTH IT!!!!"
2,Horrible Customer Support,"The Handspring Visor Edge worked for about 1 year and then quit. The online support is awful, and the number is priced per minute. I would suggest that you purchase a PDA from a company obviously willing to stand behind it's product, maybe PALM. Other than that it is a great handheld."
4,Good but mine broke,I am a jr. high student that saved up and purchased a Visor Edge. I broke three months after purchasing it but i got it replaced at Best Buy. It is great for organizing and easily fits in my pocket before class. Now everyone at my school wants one. I love its datebook and calculator for working on math and other homework.
1,Unreliable w/production problems,"Got an Edge last week. After 4 days, touch screen stopped working (actually, it brought up the properties/menu bars across the top of the screen no matter where I touched the screen with the stylus). Had to return it. From reading message boards on the Visor, I am not the first to have these problems.I think this problem is somehow caused by a short circuit/loose connection related to the Edge connector (new port on back that attaches to a Springboard attachment which attaches to a Springboard module). The problems with my touch screen occurred right after I took off the cover (for about the 10th time) and then replaced it.Handspring needs to make a more reliable product. I would advise people to wait for the Palm M500-series products to start retailing instead of buying this unreliable PDA."
3,Simply impractical.,"I lost my Visor Deluxe and decided to ""upgrade"" to the Edge. Immediately I've discovered that the awkward position of the hinged cover makes it cumbersome and impractical for the kind of frequent, quick uses I make of the device. Because you can't fold the cover all the way back, actual use of the Edge in effect ""doubles"" its size besides making it hard to manage on small surfaces or ""on the fly."" Of course, I could take the cover off entirely, but that exposes the electrical contacts to possible damage. Now I have no choice but to return the unit and order another Deluxe. Bummer. You'd think the Handspring people would have had the foresight to provide a more thoughtfully designed hinge."
3,"Was great for two weeks, then crashed and burned.","Being a practicing physician, I loved the Visor Edge because it gave me the ability to have loads of drug and treatment information at my fingertips in a really sleek, futuristic design. The added organizer and game play abilities were great as well. I could go on rounds or see patients in the office and simply pull the Edge out of my pocket when needed. Unfortunetely, after two weeks of using it, the system crashed completely. Handspring is sending me a new device but now I'm left without my ""all-in-one"" organizer/reference device for three to five days AND I will have to reload most of the medical applications when the new one arrives. If it didn't crash, I'd give the Edge five stars, but I'm forced now to give it three. If the new one crashes, I'd downgrade my review to one star. We'll see..."
2,So much more!,"I bought this unit when the price was $[money] and still feel like I got a deal. I planned to use it for phone numbers and scheduling but I have found many other uses.As a teacher, it is my grade book and attendance list.As a theatre director, it is my task manger and deadline reminder.As an info junkie, it is my newspaper.The screen is solid, I don't need colorThe stylus is nice, no cheap plasticHandsping costomer service is fine (repair in 5 days at no charge in the first year)The unit is light, and the price is now incredible.Enjoy"
2,"Good Product, bad logistics","The Handspring Visor Edge worked great for about a year. It suddenly stopped working, charging, and resetting. I would consider waiting, and purchase a color screen."
4,A warm and funny look back at a wonderful show.,"This book was fun to read but I wish Mr. Manetti would have included more behind the scenes 'what were they like' type of thing with more of the guest stars and recurring guests that appeared on the show. More photos would have been nice too. I really like the listing of all the episodes included in the back of the book as I didn't realize I'd missed seeing so many; now I can watch for them on A&E. Overall, the book was good, funny and an easy relaxing read. Many times I found myself laughing out loud over some of the stories. I hope Universal will go ahead with the idea of a Magnum movie, wether a feature film or several 2-hour movies for television as mentioned in the book. With all the Magnum fans I know a feature would be a success! Go for it Universal!"
3,Rick writes an expose,"This book is by Larry Manetti - who played ""Rick"" in the TV show.Right away it is apparent that Larry is no writer. Don't expect literary genius here.He provides some insight into the inner workings of the show, how and where it was filmed, and some of the things that happened behind the scenes. At best it's a collection of show trivia, really. I loved the TV show, and found lots of things he wrote about that were fairly interesting. You find out that Tom Selleck is a genuinely really nice guy, and very generous to his friends.But when I finished the book (and that didn't take long) I really didn't care about it anymore. I gave it to my aunt who is a Tom Selleck fanatic."
3,Nice,It came as advertised. On time and without any unwanted surprises. Bought it for a new percussionist in the home and he has been very pleased.
4,Great for Practicing!,"I am a music enthusiast! I am learning the piano and drums at the same time. A percussionists told me to practice on a drum pad. This drum pad set was so cool for me! It came with a stand, sticks, and was good quality. It was easy to set up and had a cool carrying case. I enjoy practicing drumming techniques I learn from my teacher. It helps me to stay focus, and practice proper rhythm and strokes. I enjoy my drum pad!"
3,Warning: bag not as pictured,"The pad and stand are great. However, the photo makes it look like there's an all-in-one carrying bag that holds the pad and the sticks. The product I received had a *very* cheap bag for the pad and a cheap, large wide bag for the stand. There is no bag for the sticks."
3,toner,I was not completely satisfied with this product as it did not put out the number of copies the HP cartridge does.
2,Not up to ESQ Quality,I purchased this watch less than six months ago and it has already died! I find that the wrist band collects dirt easily and the crystal scatched easily. The styling is very nice and it is of medium weight. I would not buy it unless it came with a saphire crystal and an extended service warranty.
1,Not worth your time.,"The minute this was taken out of the box, set up and turned on it was taken apart and packed back up. My step son LOVES trains but I couldnt stand to have this in our house. You cant even hear yourself think over the level of noise this thing makes. If youre looking into buying this for under your tree, dont. Its way too big. I would not waste my time on this product."
1,LOUD,"I think that when people say that an incoming tornado sounds like a train, they have the New Bright Holiday Express 181 in mind."
4,Great for around the Christmas Tree,"I just purchased the Santa Train for our Holiday Season and it is a great value for $20.00 a nice size set , we had set up the train set by our Christmas Tree and the kids just love it ,I would recommend this set to my freinds Dom New York"
1,I bought this train despite the other reviews . . .,and wish I had listened! I planned to put it around our Christmas tree and my husband put it together this morning and turned it on and the sound really is horrible. I think others described it as a leaf blower or weedeater type sound. It totally drowns out the music and train sounds. My 4 year old son even agreed that it was too loud and we should take it back and buy a different train. Good price and cute to look at but the sound is unbearable.
4,You get your moneys worth,"We got this same train from walmart about three years ago for the same price. I agree with the other reviews it is sort of loud and annoying but my two sons who are now four and two love it. It lasted about three holidays seasons and that is good enough for me, it was on non-stop, it didn't break it just seemed like the rubber on the wheels lost there traction and began to get stuck. There is a button on the top so they can turn it on and off all by themselves and be very independent with it. Now this year we got it again and they love it they fight over the button now but that is it. It falls off the track but only when hit , I've never had it just run off the track, it is easy though to get it right back on. Like I said in my title you really get your moneys worth. I don't see a point in spending $100 plus on a train that I wouldn't want them to touch. They enjoy that is all that matters to me it keeps them busy for a while."
1,Horrible screeching sound,"It's a cute holiday train set, however, the engine makes a horrible screeching sound that pratically drowns out the music or train sounds. We bought 2 sets to see if there was the same problem and there was so we returned them."
1,Terrible!,"As both other reviewers stated, this train makes a terrible sound that makes the music all but inaudible. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,Disappointing!!,"I LOVE these guys, I love all three of their other cds, (that includes their new cd). But this their third cd really is boring!! Slow and dull!! Nothing as good as the two previous cds by them nor is it as good as their brand new cd."
5,The Best I've Heard Ever,"I love all of Cracker albums. These guys have already replaced P.Jam, S. Pumpkins, P. Floyd, STP, America, British band ""Bronco"", etc. in my list of favorites. My son, my daughter, my wife and I met David, Johnny, Kenny and Frank in Phoenix, several days ago and we got their autographs. One thing is for sure, they are the most talented musicians and down to earth. I give their CD's as presents whenever I can. The albums, including this one give you the feeling of "" The Good Life"" .M.Rad"
1,Alarmingly Regressive for Such a Progressive Appearing Book,"This book had ""positive"" and ""feminist"" written all over it, from its multi-cultural associations to its illustration technique. Not a single princess is self-reliant, the stories are a groan, and most of the characters are downright unlikeable. What a FAIL."
1,"Take me now, God!","Even if you are a really eager devotee of end-times movies and books, this is one clunker to be avoided! Don't let the impressive cast (Gary Busey, Howie Mandell, Margot Kidder) lead you astray! This is a low-budget, lame script, cliche-ridden rehash of the old evil-UN, rapture, one-world-government stuff from Channel 23.The minimal efforts to portray the future are only topped for awfulness by a hideously syrupy soundtrack.Nick Mancuso makes a great anti-Christ but I can't think of another good acting job or indeed any good thing about this turkey. ""Left Behind"" is a WAY better movie bet on the same subject!"
1,Interesting concept -- terrible,"Simply one of the worst films ever produced since Man first shouldered a camera.A fascinating topic rendered ridiculous by a dreadful script, dreadful directing and perfectly awful performances from a shopworn collection of actors.Instead of intriguing me -- the non-evangelical person with a reasonably open mind -- ""Tribulation"" made me wonder if its really humanly possible that conservative Christians believe this simplistic hokum."
1,"Tribulation by name, travesty by nature.","From start to finnish this direct-to-video film is truly awful with terrible direction, amatuer filmaking sensibility , weak scripting and lousy acting by billed stars Gary Busey,Howie Mandel & Margot Kidder not to mention rest of co involved. Busey's character Tom Canoboro is a chapter of accidents as a deadly earnest cop clumsily endeavouring to foil Satan(Nick Mancuso, whose debauched glee is ironically the only bright spark)in his attempted global dominance. Ensemble cast quote unconvincingly from the Good Book, but not even the Second Coming would resurrect such disordered rubbish. Finally before Christians get mad at this review I enjoy some programs such as TVs ""Touched By an Angel' irregardless of my own personal beliefs and wished for my six dollars back after renting this overly preachy poor excuse for a movie from my Video Store, buyers beware strongly suggest rental viewing first."
2,The point is...,"...the ""prophecy"" referring to the People Of Babel (Gen. 11:6) will in actuality have no part whatsoever in the actual Tribulation. And the fact that this whole movie was based around it being an actual prophecy that was eventually to come to pass really was a disappointment to me.The film gets 2 stars because, I'll admit, although the script was badly written, the acting was good, and the first half hour was quite intriguing until I found out what the whole plot of the movie revolved around.The real reason I think some people don't like it (as do I) is that these Christians are proposing that this prophecy will be true which will mislead any Non-Christian viewers of the movie into believing that it will happen. And because of that, I feel that this movie (as entertaining as it may be) should not be taken as a literal or accurate depiction of what the Tribulation will bring to the earth."
4,"I like this movie, because.....","I like this movie, because, even tho it's a little cheesey, and not scary at all, I just felt kinda endeared to Gary and Margot & Howie- I think they did a great job of stirring my emotions. I think Margot Kidder is quite a trooper; she's been thru a lot since her Superman the Movie days, and every bit of it shows on her face. I really think she's a good person, and I would like to meet her someday if I ever get the opportunity.(yea, right, like that'll happen!) The one thing that cracks me up about this flick, tho, is even after waking up after at least a year long coma, Gary's character has got very long shaggy hair, and matching beard, but he didn't lose one ounce of that excessive belly fat! Hilarious! I still love this movie, tho."
1,You Gotta Be Kidding Me,"People who gave this clunker five stars really need to get out more. The acting, even for the ""stellar"" cast was cardboardy, and the script was...well, there wasn't a script. It was another brainless rehash of Hal Lindsay eschatology. It is embarassing, to tell the truth. Don't waste your time with this movie. Go play with your kids, or take the dog for a walk, or something. Anything."
2,"really, really hokey stuff in this film","I thought the cast did a respectable job with what they had to work with. The real star of the film was Nick Mancuso as Franco Macalousso. Mancuso made a believable antichrist.However, this film had one very hokey part which brought the quality of the film down a lot. So the ""image of the beast"" is a virtual reality helmet. What in the blue hell were the script writers smoking when they dreamt that up, even when they dreamt it up in the movie's prequel, ""Revelations""? How does a VR helmet burn a 666 on somebody's hand? How does a VR helmet cause a snakebite to appear on somebody in the real world? The whole VR helmet thing was really ill-conceived...okay, the VR helmet thing was STUPID."
5,Tribulation,Tribulation.Is an Excellent movie.Watching this movie is an eye opener for what's to cometo all the non believers.If you have any serious doubt about what is gonna happen(IF YOU BELIEVE) after the Rapture (God taking away the believers)then watch this movieAnd you will not have any reason not to believe.
5,I almost missed it,"I have had this movie for about 6 years, and justwatched it the other day. I almost missed it and it wassuch a good movie. I didn't see anything contrary tothe Bible and it held my interest throughout the wholemovie. I don't see how anyone could give this less than4 stars unless they are just expecting something really""mainstream media"". I found it to be pretty accurate andentertaining."
1,RBM (Really Bad Movie),"Poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted.I was hoping for something more, and this movie did not have it. Extremely low-budgeted and it shows. A person wakes from a coma, then goes on the run immediately. Don't think so.Remember the sign of the Antichrist will not be able to be duplicated, a plain branded of 666 is too plain and I would think people would see right through it.The first convert is extremely stupid, as a guy with his arm in his shirt is suddenly given his arm back."
3,Missing a lot of songs,"This album should have been released as a double album, I mean really its missing so much wheres ""If"" and ""Anytime Anyplace"" as well as many others, the only reason I gave the album 3 stars is because it's missing songs, otherwise being that its Miss Janet it would get 5. But I really can't say too much because I have all her albums except this one so I don't really need it. Just giving my humble opinion! :0)"
3,This is Old,I found this at a rummage sale for 50 cents. Highlights Jackson's career from 1986 to 1995. Quality music without the Michael Jackson monkey on her back. A good look at a respectable musician.
2,Oh no......,"This one will be at CD Warehouse too, I love Janet and I thought I would love this one, but I couldn't even make it all the way through, I tried skipping through it but they all seemed to start off with the same beat. Maybe it's just not riding music, so I'll try it as clean-up music before I sell it."
1,failed bustier,"Janet started out as an actress on the hit show Different Strokes as the girl friend to the character Willis. She was wholesome and sweet and represented a sort of innocence that America once had. Well after Super Bowl XXXVIII she's lost all that as she's relied on her chestal region time and time again to try to compensate for the crappy music. All this from a star who's brother owns the elephant mans bones! But then again what do you expect? The whole Jackson clan is Off The Wall, their music is BAD, so why don't they just beat it?"
1,not a complete disc,first of all control is not janet jackson first album she did 2 early albums for a&m records 1982 janet jackson and 1984 dreamstreet and she had a total of 5 singles hit the billboard chart so for this album to be called design of a decade its not correct you always have to hear the beginning not the ending and i like the first two albums better then control and any other album she has done so before we judge things we dont know about listen first and those first two albums sold very well not more then control because she had two of the best producers of the 1980s where are they now and rene and angela did cuts on the very first janet jackson album so theres a difference between the albums control is more danceable and the other two are for mature people
4,janets designs,janet also one of my favorite female artist this is a good music cd i own it also enjoy it.
5,For The Little Janet Fan,If your not really a Janet fan this is for you. It has all her big hits like Black Cat and Thats The Way Love Goes and two new hot songs Twenty Forepley and Runaway. I had Janets early stuff but got this just for the new songs. Overall this is a good greatest hits album
2,design of a decade,"Product was not as expected. Didn't come in original jewel case; didn't have artwork. Some of the songs wouldn't play on my computer. Was supposed to be ""like new""--was far from it. Disappointed."
5,Best album for J.J. for 80's/90's !,"If you are planning to buy the past albums of Janet Jackson like Rhythm Nation 1814 or Control, you should buy this album! It includes 16 songs! Or if you are planning to buy both albums [Rhythm Nation 1814, Control], I think you should buy this album too! This is the reason: Songs like ""Control"", ""Nasty"", ""What have you done for me Lately?"", ""Pleasure Principle"", ""When I Think of You"", ""Let's Wait Awhile"" are from the album Control. While songs like "" Rhythm Nation"", ""Miss you much"",""Love Will Never Do (Without You)"", ""Alright"", ""Escapade"", "" Black Cat"", ""Come back to me"" comes from her Rhythm Nation 1814 Album! Not forgetting the new two songs ""Runaway"" and ""Twenty Foreplay"" and the song ""Whoops Now!"" from 'janet.'...I think this is a good album! Buying 1 album is better than buying 2 albums, right?"
5,Five stars isn't enough!,"Whan this C.D. came as a gift for me, I didn't think I would like it that much. I love it! Michel Jackson is O.K., but Janet is the bomb! I think this C.D is perfect for people ages 8 and up. I got it for my 9th birthday, and I still love it!"
5,The best of the best,"One of the best greatest hits collection ever, all of her best old songs with two completly new songs (Twenty foreplay, Runaway). Only one problem it didnt have if, again, anytime anyplace, or you want this. But other than that its gteat and I strongly recomend this to everyone."
2,Better Songs For Other Countries,"The UK version of ""Design"" has a few different edits/mixes of Janet's hits than the US version, an example being a 3 & 1/2 minute edit of ""What Have You Done For Me Lately"" and the radio edit of ""Miss You Much"". Why is this? So the US public will have to spend even more money?I think this is a decent compilation for the casual Janet listener because it covers the major bases during the pinnacle of her and Jam & Lewis' most creative phase. ""Runaway"" is an excellent new track as is ""20 Fourplay"". I am also pleased at the inclusion of the much-needed remix of ""Alright"" although this is not the mix with Heavy D, unfortunately.Still it gets only 2 stars, due to the marketing gimmicks, for not including enough 7"" radio versions as opposed to album cuts, and for excluding ""If"" and ""Anytime Anyplace"" when there was still plenty of disc space left."
4,Has all the hits....,"This CD does not miss a single hit. Great, wonderful. The only reason I give 4 stars is that her work has been less great since this CD."
1,wasted time,"The book combines questionable statements (Al Kharizmi is a black mathematician),wrong statements (""mathematics is prevalent in almost all careers and professions""), and mostly trivial statements (""teachers must ...extinguish all negative verbal communications and interactions with the students""). Also you can find there derogatory generalizations about students (""youth occupy most of their free time watching television, listening to music,playing sports and games, or eating"")and teachers (""Educators are producing robots as opposed to thinkers"").Some advices suggested by the author are really funny,like the advice to college instructors to""have students develop songs, poems, sories, cartoons or rhymes on some math concept, pricipal,or skill""). What I couldn't find in the book is the answer for the title question."
2,Flip down lid limits use,"I didn't notice the flip down lid and I find it restrictive. I can't put certain sizes of bottles in that area because the lid won't shut. I'm trying to figure out how to take it off. I had this sent to us overseas so it isn't worth returning so I will make do. If I had been more careful in ordering, I wouldn't have bought this but I guess I got confused with all the different organizers. It is hard to see the lid in the picture."
4,Cosmetics Organizer,"This is exactly what I was looking for! It sits nicely on my daughter's vanity and I love tohe pull down lid in the middle to keep dust out. There are many compartments for all types of items. Shipping made the product a little pricey, so I would definitely consider that before ordering from the company again, which is why the item only got 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Traditional tunes and alternative techno unite!,"From the first moment I heard a small clip of ""Must Go On,"" I knew I had to hear more. As a dancer, I'm always looking for something fresh and alive to dance to, but I still love the classic Irish tunes I learned to dance to. Brigid Boden combines both into an album that is simultaneously inventive and traditional. Moreover, while it's a great set of songs to dance to, this album is also great when you just have to get some work done. Brigid's voice is smooth and haunting. This album is the perfect companion for long drives, late nights at the office, and lively parties. I look forward to hearing more from this fresh new artist."
3,"its a ""b"" album for me, 3.5 stars","she really loses me sometimes with in my opinion too many lyrics devoted to love. Thats the only detractor for me the music is cool, nice dance beats, cool guitar, nice light fiddle. there are a few a ballads in here as well, she has a beautiful voice, its just the love thing kills me, if she was singing in another language that i didnt undertsand id give it 5 stars. Definately check it out though there are some really good songs."
1,One man's art is another man's .....................,"Why did the art department make Brigid look like a raccoon on the cover? Surely celtic rap was already a hard sell without suggesting the singer is a small, nocturnal, tree-dwelling carnivore."
2,Beware when every five-star reviewer has only reviewed one book...,"...it's a virtual guarantee that the authors enlisted their friends and family to pump up their ratings.If you like self-conscious cuteness and obvious jokes that get old after the first few pages, this would be a great addition to your coffee table. Otherwise it's a great addition to your re-gifting box.Bonnie and Clyde full of bullet holes... oh, the originality! Oh, the hilarity! WhatEVER will they do with Dolly Parton?"
5,"fruity, fun and tastfully done","For the artist, political-historian, with a flair for fun. Let your imagination run. You'll love this fruity delight! Mrs. C. S> Weinstein"
5,Harry + piano = excellence,"With this CD you will hear Harry at his most intimate just his piano and voice and a few close friends. You feel that you are actually sitting in on the recording. His playing is both exciting and mellow and his singing is soulfull and inspiring. Some reviewers seem to be confused that Harry does not sing on every track but that is the nature of such CDs as 11, 20, 25 and 30 where Harry's piano playing takes the spotlight. Harry minus his big band does not mean the listener is being short-changed instead they are experiencing another side to his music. Relax and enjoy it!"
4,Funky and playful,"I enjoyed his previous album, ""25,"" which was a similar type of album: playful, pared-down and intimate, showcasing Connick's natural singing and piano skills. I particularly enjoyed that and also this album, ""30."" Connick's singing style is easy and strong, without being too processed or smooth; I particularly liked songs which showcase his imaginative and offbeat renditions on the piano, such as ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" and ""Somewhere My Love."" These were refreshing and I wish more artists had the talent to showcase their takes on songs without ""having"" to sing a note. This is a thoroughly enjoyable album and I hope more listeners understand what he is doing with it -- and really ""get"" it."
4,Harry gets better with age,"I really enjoyed this CD! Harry explores all different genres.....I especially like #9 and #11, because I a fan of the French Quarter/ New Orleans style that I will always know him for...A good buy! The CD for you if you prefer the mellow, demure side of Harry....."
2,Dull tones,"I thought this CD was rather dull compared to his earlier work. I'm normally a fan of Connick, but sometimes the originals need to say original."
3,An Old Harry Connick Jr. Fan,"Naturally Harry is a very talented person, however I didn't enjoy this cd as much as I thought I would. When previewing the cd I recognised the songs in the list and thought this cd would be really cool . . but it wasn't. If you're like most people you enjoy harry when he performs big band style and this is not big band/this is grandpa and his piano. Although the songs are well sung and well played they are boring. Kind of like elevator music. I would reccomend the albums ""she"" and ""we are in love"" they are excellent. love to all fellow harry fans (the few of us there are), me"
3,Not enough great material to warrent buying it.,"I respect Harry Connick for his efforts to take familiar material and recast it in a fresh light. When everything clicks, the result is a very enjoyable track. Unfortunately I found only two such tracks on this CD. Considering the cost of this CD, I don't feel that I got my money's worth."
2,Very Average,"oh a Decade ago I really was digging Connick especialy after the Soundtrack for ""When Harry Met Sally"" but after a while all His Stuff got to Polished&forced without any edge&then He went Pop&to Me hasn't recovered.in fact I think of Him more so as a Actor now.He still can Play the Piano alright&whatnot but what made Him really flow is long gone to me.this set has some moments but it's to close to the Vest&now it seems like He is trying His Best to Flow in that Vein again but with Mix Results to me.I suggest His 80's to Early 90's Stuff&then call it a day.He should have been further along in His Career than He is.His Voice still has Moments but His Golden Roll is long Gone."
4,Great for Analog TV's,"I bought this back in 2002... long before HDTV. This allows you to hook up your pc to an old school tube through composite connection or s-video. This downconverts from digital to analog, so the text is not sharp, but movies and pictures and videos are fine. I have no use for this device anymore, but i still use the Y splitter for audio with my IPOD. Basically, to hook my ipod up to my stereo with the microphone jack. .Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6FT)Nowadays, you probably only need a VGA cable if you have a new HDTV.STARTECH.COM MXT101MMHQ 6' Coax SVGA Monitor CableThis connection should be digital quality and is much cheaper. Don't buy a real long vga cable unless you know your graphics card can handle the length. I bought a 15 footer and it didn't work with my Dell laptop. You still may want a Y-splitter microphone jack to rca for your sound"
4,great watch - not so great watch band,the watch is beautiful but the band cracked very quickly. tried to find a replacement band but want able to
4,Worth the money,"We were looking for arm chairs that would go with a table we refinished and did not want to spend too much. These chairs fit the bill. They are as we expected, very nice looking but not of the highest quality. There was some simple assembly involved and one of our chairs arms had a broken piece. It took a while to get the replacement arm but the seller did replace it. We are very happy with how the chairs look with our table and the were worth the price."
1,Get on with it. Please.,"I was determined to give this book 100 pages. I couldn't get past 85 before I had to kick it to the curb.For God's sake, aussies are known for shortening words and names, right? If they can shorten 'biscotti' to 'bickie' and 'utility vehicle' to 'ute,' why couldn't the editor have sliced the first 1/3 of the book and got to the point?And what's with Cashin the cop not even seeing a reason to go upstairs to the victim's house to take a look around? You know, the house in which the victim was attacked? He only went up there so the stepdaughter could retrieve some items?Addition: I read the other reviews after I posted mine. I'm perfectly good with beautiful writing in a crime novel, in which the crime takes a back seat. I simply don't care for this author's writing. Especially the endless dialogue."
1,This is a complete loser.,I know enough Aussies to know that they all do not live in the gutter. I struggled through about one half of this literary travesty before I threw it in the trash.
2,Three hundred some pages of nothing happening.,"Three hundred some pages of nothing happening. It's not too hard to discover the nastiness behind the motive, but to guess the murderer you might as well throw at a dartboard blindfolded.I suppose some will find the coarse Aussie dialog funny. And the finale is dramatic, but it takes so long to get there, it hardly seems worth it.Next time I'm going to make sure a book has at least 100 reviews before buying it. Less than that is probably because nobody is finishing it."
2,"Interesting view of Australia, but ...","I've had one extensive vacation in various parts of eastern Australia, and found it interesting to read about the rural parts of the same general area. But I felt like this book dragged on forever, introducing new subplots, but without a central focus."
3,Too Scobie Doo-ish at the end,"THE BROKEN SHORE has its high points. For those outside of Australia, it is very revealing about race relations there.There are many parts also that have a nice narrative flow. However, the last twenty pages of the book reveal out of theblue the murderer, and before that it seems that Peter Temple wanted to demonstrate that he could make nearly every charactera sexual deviant. By the end, I just didn't like it that much."
4,Australian Crime Novel,"This is a crime novel. Sort of. Set in Australia, the story is about Joe Cashin, a cop who is on disability leave, recovering from an injury. He returns to the town he grew up in and becomes involved in helping to solve a local crime. Cashin is an interesting character, and that makes for interesting reading. The past and present are both ""present"" in this story, and that, too, makes for interesting reading. The overall tone of the book is dark, not only because of the outcome, but because of the racism that permeates society (especially the police force) and the damage done to the environment. Definitely worth reading."
4,Excellent mystery,"Add Peter Temple to Australia's successful invasion of American arts along with Jackman, Kidman and Baz Luhrmann. Joe Cashin, Temple's lumbering opera listening hero, is the Outback's Russell Crowe detective type with snappy staccato Elmore Leonard-esque dialogue and wonderfully descriptive riffs on the beauty of the wild south coast of Australia. His characters are well formed and his action scenes turn thrilling especially at the explosive crescendo. His quick turns of scene expedite the story line allowing the reader to appreciate Temple's superb mastery of characterization and societal commentary."
3,Like driving behind someone who brakes too much,"Everything good about Peter Temple's writing seems over-powered by his staccato style. In the end I found myself forgetting what I'd read on the page before because the writing is never permitted to flow beyond a one thought sentence. I don't think this is good writing, I'm sorry. Sometimes a complex sentence is better than three short ones."
1,Save your money. The book is not worth buying!!,"First of all the book is misrepresentated in its title and length of pages. The brief information on the book lists that it is 52 pages when actually it is only 45 pages, including the five blank pages in the back of the book for taking notes. The title is even more misleading in that it gives the potential buyer the impression that they will learn everything they need to know to begin loan signings. This is far from the truth. The information in this book was no more helpful for beginning signers than what could be found for free on various mortgage websites. Needless to say, this book is in NO WAY a ""Field Manual"" and is EXTREMELY overpriced for its content."
1,This book claims that Pope follows USSR.,"About ten years ago, I tried to read this book.It's so bad, ridiculous, absurd, bogus, bigoted, that I didn't finished it.The core's idea of this ""trash-book"" is that catholic chuch(Pope included) has a strong alliance with Soviet Union.Put aside the fact that this trash-book is completely outdated, it's also completely wrong and absurd about this subject.As history showed, the Pope John Paul II, helped very much the fall of Soviet dominance, in Poland and all Eastern Europe.And this happened about ten years, after this bad book be writen."
3,Nothin' Special,"This turned out to be a bit too expensive for what it does, although it is high quality sharp!!! This has an excellent blade, but the plastic cover seems a bit flimsy where it bends & I see it breaking in two in the not so distant future, but not affecting it's main use. I have since bought a spice Microplane which I had been looking for when I impulsively bought this that puts this to shame!!! The metal storage container on this is cute & unique and it won't permanently hold odors, but I found no use for it. GR8 4 some, just not me."
2,Too Short!!,"The picture for this item is completely deceiving. These shirts are only about 16 inches long- way too short to be a top unles you like your belly showing. I'd much rather it be to the waist, OR make it a few inches shorter, almost like a bra substitue. This length just frustrates me. The sizes overal do not make any sense overall; they look like children's or tweens' sizes. It's too bad bc I love the all cotton fabric (much cooler than those with Spandex) and the variety of pretty colors."
1,Terribly out-of-date,"Don't buy this book! It's terribly out-of-date. The author recommends using DDT to get rid of a dog's fleas. Most of the photographs (all forty or fifty years old) are so dark, the images are nearly indecipherable. There must be something better!"
5,"Yes, it makes water taste MUCH better.","The Katadyne Carbon Cartridge is a nice addition to our water filter pump. It makes the water taste MUCH better!The only drawback I have is it takes up more space in my pack, but I did get it to fit into the my Katadyne pump case...but barely. Still, it's just so much better drinking water without funny tastes, so cramming it into the case is worth it.This comes with 2 packs of carbon. One pack is more than you need, so just save it and you can get 3 fills from the 2 packs. We shake and air out the filter for a couple days after use so the carbon is thouroghly dry, then put everything away. The carbon should last a long time...just dry completely after coming home and change the carbon when you taste fish in your water again!"
5,Performs the task set out for it.,"This is an activated charcoal filter, namely, it removes reactive chemicals like chlorine from the water that has already passed through your microfilter by binding them up with the activated charcoal. It does precisely what it is supposed to do if used properly and at a very reasonable price. Clean tasting water and no smell associated with sulfur etc."
2,Windows 98 Trouble,"I tried installing the modem software in Windows 98 according to directions and had much difficulty. The software corrupted my registry a number of times, which I then had to restore. Software was poorly designed. I finally got it installed, and it is working fine. However, to avoid headaches, I would look for another modem if you have Windows 98."
4,Everglades Hanbook will enrich your visit,"Probably the most useful and interesting single book on the Everglades. If you're on a budget, the older edition contains much of the same information at a fraction of the cost."
4,Awesome color but not long lasting,I had mixed feelings about this product. The colors are amazing but the polish chips off in clumps after about 2-3 days :(I've tried using base and top coat. I've tried using less/thinner and no change.
3,It was pretty good..,"It was very thick, thicker than I expected it to be. The brush is somewhat weirdly shaped. I really like the color & it came within 2 days!"
5,Wonderful,This color is absolutely beautiful...especially on darker skin. I was happy to see it was available somewhere because I couldn't locate it anywhere in the stores. Was shipped to my home very securely. No problems.
4,Love This polish!,This is a great polish when your tired of the same old look! You can get the look of a French tip with just some clear polish to go on the tips of your nails! The downside about this polish is that it doesn't last very long I would say if you need something quick and different for one day use it but it won't last more than a day maybe 2 if you don't work with your hands even washing them makes the paint chip. But overall I say go for it I like it for occasional use.
4,Orly Polish,"Love this polish, I first tried it at my nail salon, then decided to buy it but had a hard time finding it, so amazon.com it is! I love it, it's neutral yet purple..."
4,Pretty blue glitter polish,"Such a pretty blue! Looks great alone or over another color! If you want to get attention to your manicure, this will work."
5,One of my favorite Orly colors!,"I just love, love love this pink!!! It's the perfect pink shade, a nice warm, medium pink. The finish is very unique. It think they call it a ""jelly"" finish. The color sort of builds up the more layers you add and yet it has a sort of translucency while still being opaque. It paints on beautifully smooth - no streaks! - and dries swiftly. I love the style of bottle that Orly uses as well. The straight sides make it very easy to get the polish out of the bottle, even when the level of polish is low in the bottle. Also their polishes last a while without getting thickened or sticky. Their brushes are the best of any brand of nail polish too, just the right length and width to get a perfect manicure. Orly is my favorite brand of polish :D"
2,not happy,This fingernails polish arrived in a timely manner and in good order. The color is very pretty but it doesn't go on well and doesn't smooth out. No matter what I did I had globby brush strokes. My last attempt to salvage the product was to use polish thinner but this didn't work either. I ended up thtowing it out. I don't recommend this product.
2,Difficult to apply.,"I was super excited to finally find a matte polish, but when it arrived and I tried to apply it it was very difficult. I would suggest maybe having a professional apply it. It also chipped very easily."
2,not really mirror finish,"My daughter ordered this ""Mirror Mirror"" nail polish thinking it would be reflective and silver, like a mirror. It is not. It is gray, shiny but opaque."
5,Love It!!,"This is the most amazing color I have ever got from Orly! I love their whole collection! This polish was not even in stores in my town yet and I instantly fell in love with it! It looks amazing on the nail, the shimmer is so rainbows and beautiful! I can't wait to use it all spring and summer, I'm sure it would look great on almost every skin tone. It went on in 2 coats and hasn't hipped for 3 days. This was way better then I could have hoped and I cantwaitto get the other colors in this collection!"
4,I love this color!,"I have used this color over and over again. It has a shimmer and in different lights it changes color, I 'm not so sure I'm going to buy the other nailpolishes of this collection, but I definitely adore this one!"
2,disappointing colors,"i purchased 'out of this world' and 'it's not rocket science' and they are both downright weird colors. they're dull-looking and have no depth. the color of 'it's not rocket science' can only be described as 'unappetizing' and 'out of this world' chipped off within hours, worse than most drug store brands. these look beautiful in pictures online, but dull and lifeless in person."
4,Fast delivery.,I received the item very fast. I am so happy! Thanks. Will do business again. I love to use this with water marbling nails. I ordered Orly mini Summer Vibe nail polish. I cant wait to get it. Update: Went to use product and it appears the brush was kinked. So someone cut off some of the brush. Which really makes the brush hard to use. Keeping item. Im not one to return things. I can still make it work. But removing a star.
5,Love this color,"I love this color a lot, great for every season, love the brush as well paint beautifully. Fast delivery, I recommend this color, you won't regret it."
4,Beautiful color,"I was getting a manicure and the lady across from me had this polish on so I decided to get it too. It looked silver on her (she was a pale lady) and it looked more of a gold/bronze on me (I'm olive-skinned). I loved the color on me anyway and decided to order it. The only cons are that it chips pretty soon if I don't use a clear topcoat (all my Orly's do that), and Amazon.com can't ship it overseas where I live so I had to ship it to my mom who held onto it after I decided I was going to visit, and I found it cheaper at Sally's."
1,Not right product,I was mailed the wrong color polish and contacted the company twice with no response. Paid a premium to find exactly what I wanted online and have it shipped just to receive the wrong item.
4,A True Opaque Pale Pink,"Yes, this streaks. Yes, the manicure doesn't last as long as it would with OPI or Essie. Yes, the brush is too small and causes the polish to go on streaky. Yes, these are not good attributes, but WOW is the color amazing. Not a single photo on Amazon can relay what a pretty soft pink this is, and the fact that it is NOT sheer makes me love it despite all these negatives.This is a pale, seashell pink. Two or even three coats are required for streak-free coverage, but the extra time is worth the wait. Use a good thick topcoat like Seche Vite and this will be a beautiful manicure or pedicure.It does have a tendency to chip or peel but that is after about 4-5 days with the right topcoat. Without a topcoat you can be sure that your nails will be scuffed and missing paint.If you want a beautiful SOLID pale pink, I would definitely recommend this color."
4,"nice, but...","The shipping was fast.The packaging is really smooth and pretty.I really like the foggy (matte) effect when I first put it on, but it wears out pretty quickly and started chipping off little by little.The matte effect becomes unclear and shiny rather fast.I like this product in general, and it's not really expensive."
1,POLISH REVIEW,THIS POLISH WAS NOT A VERY ATTRACTIVE PINK. STAYED ON AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ORLY POLISH. JUST TOO BRIGHT A PINK FOR ME.
1,Tacky.,"All of these nail polishes in this line make your nails look incredibly tacky. And not to mention the texture is not good, very strange feeling, and not a good one at that."
3,Cupcakes and Unicorns!,How could anyone resist that name? I layered it over a pink base and it adds a nice shimmer. The bars are very sparse and hard to get out of the bottle so you shouldn't expect those to cooperate.
2,Chips in one day,I have been searching high and low for leather nail polish and was so excited when I found this product. It arrived quickly. As soon as I received it I tried it out. Applied it on a Friday and it began chipping a few hours later. I am not rough with my nails...the only reason I can think of for the quick chipping would have to be that since you can't apply a top coat (it will defeat the whole purpose of buying a matte finish/leather polish) then it has no protective layer. I really want to try the OPI version of this product.
2,I'd love it...if it stayed on.,"I love the color and the shimmer. But it chips so easily, even with a topcoat it seems to flake right off. It's definitely a one day polish for me...and not even a long day."
5,Plays well with Others as well as Alone,"I bought this color on sale at a local beauty sale and it is worth every penny!At first, I only used the color alone, applying two coats for amazing results. But layering this over ANY color allows this polish to take on a whole new attitude.I wore this color for 6 days with no chips using Orly Top 2 Bottom as the top coat."
5,beautiful blue,"This color is amazing! Its a nice medium blue base, very bright. It has small flakes of metallic blue and purple. The finish is nice and shiny, also it only took two coats to be a very nice solid color. I'll be wearing this color a lot."
2,Occasionally interesting,"This book consists of a series 13 new essays by well-known writers on the topic of consumerism, together with an introduction by Roger Rosenblatt. About half the essays are sermons on the demons of consumerism and consumption. Mixed in with the diatribe are some interesting more informative pieces on such topics as competitive spending (Juliet Schor), youth consumerism (Alex Kotlowitz), ecology (Bill McKibben), publishing (Andre Schiffrin), and housework (Jane Smiley). Bharati Mukherjee contributes an Indian immigrant's view on consumerism, which hints at the lack of concern or comprehension about hyper-consumerism held by the population of one of the world's largest developing countries. If you are interested in consumerism (or preparing your own sermon on the topic), you may find some material of interest in this book."
3,Remembering your uniqueness,This book was required reading for my Reiki Master class. Ms. Ford provides excellent tools for personal growth and acceptance. I also included this book on my resouce list for my clients.
5,Excellent,"I found this book and Ford's other book, The Dark Side of The Light Chasers, to be the best books for working on your ""shadow"". I highly recommend these two books if you are interested in shadow work."
5,shadow,Everyone needs to deal with their shadows in order to truly know themselves. Debbie Ford leads in this field.
2,Disappointed,"After reading ""The Dark Side of the Light Chasers,"" I expected the same level of insight in this volume. Instead, I found a smorgasbord of various religions that didn't really seem to do justice to any particular one. I realize this book is more self-help and self-discovery oriented, but the spiritual overtones were too strong and too garbled to be of any real help. Ford is a good writer, and she does have some helpful insights on personal care habits, so I give this one two stars."
4,It's not all that bad,"You know, when this record first came out, I was so mad it wasn't like ""old JP."" But after reflecting on their great career (which ended in December of 1997), this album stands on its own with for the most part, quality songs.Besides having traces of the trademark JP sound (""Six Page Letter,"" ""Say that you Love Me,"") it has their greatest hit ""Vineyard."" Cary Pierce has some nice songs (especially ""More than This""), but most of all it's Jack O""Neill's songs which are underrated on this disc. ""River"" is very much in his old style of writing, and the lyrics in the title track still make you think. The bonus track number 24 ""World's Greatest"" maybe one of Jack's strongest ever.No, this isn't like the earlier JP albums (""Bringing on the Weather"" and ""Women as Salvation"" are a MUST), and there are a few songs (""Get it Together,"" the cheesy instrumental ""Ivy"") you can skip past.But give ""Finest Hour"" a chance. It may grow on you as it did me."
4,"disappointing, but still good","although this cd fell way short of the greatness of their previous cds, it is still very good. this was my first jackopierce cd, and I thought it was the greatest music i'd ever heard... only after hearing the rest of their music on ""decade"" did I realize how much of a disappointment this, their last cd, was. a good cd, but for your money, get decade, it's a similar price with all the good songs off this cd."
2,"Loose, freewheeling band wrapped up in tidy box","Friends, the title I think describes accurately what happened to one of favorite bands on this, their last studio recording. For reasons that escape me, the talented and creative Dallas duo traded in their sparkling mix of acoustic and electric guitar for a more dry and contained mix. The result was supposed to be that they combined forces with a band and were now legitimate entity in the music business, ready for all that could come their way. But in the end this recording feels like Jackobox (Jackopierce in the box). Like other reviewers, it pains me to say these words, but do yourself a favor and check out Bringing On The Weather. Prouced by Counting Crowes producer T-Bond Burnett, it shimmers with an emotional pull and downright heartfelt drive."
3,Ditto the other reviews..,"Notice the lyrics of ""Is it the Sun"" (we want to know who'll be the next big thing) and ""More than This"" (it should have been more than...) Lots of irony. After not getting much support for the fantastic ""Bringing on the Weather,"" I think JP was going for the radio friendly attempt at a disc. But even on Cary Pierce's site himself he says the label wasn't too excited about ""Finest Hour,"" so what can you do. There's a few nice songs, but that's about it. Check ou ALL the earlier records to see what tremendous writers both Cary Pierce, but especailly Jack O'Neill were."
2,A big let down,"Is it any suprise that A&M records dropped JP after this debacle?! I know thast there was alot of turmoil over what sound they were going to have on this album. They kept going back and re-recording and mixing and changing the songs for this album. I blame the record company for this one. They were obviously pressured to play a style that would be easier to market, but it failed. All in all, there are a few really good songs on this album. The hidden track of Trials is the best song. Is It The Sun is not very JP like but still is a good song. Hmmmm....you know I have every JP album and those are the only 2 off of this one I can say I actually ever listen to. Hmmm....I guess this album really does stink. It hurts to say it because I have always been a HUGE JP fan. Oh well, good luck Jack w/ American Horse and Carey.... get over yourself man."
2,Disappointing,"There's probably a reason why no one else has reviewed this album. It doesn't inspire the least bit of enthusiasm in the listener. Jackopierce's other albums are among my favorites, especially Live from the Americas and Bringing on the Weather. However, JP must have decided to plug in the electric guitars in a last-ditch effort for popularity. The result is a sound more like Seattle than Texas. It speaks volumes about the album that a ""hidden"" track, an acoustic version of ""Trials"" (performed w/electric earlier on the album) is the best song on the album--and its ""hidden"". Don't buy this--but don't hesitate to buy all the earlier albums."
1,Not at all what I ordered-terrible seller,"After a lot of research oline, I finally ordered a beautiful fountain that had a circular piece of ""slate"" with a frog imprinted on it for in my living room. When I finaly received it, it was a solar fountain to be used outside and looked absolutely nothing like the one that I had ordered. This was just a ceramic green glazed bowl with a ceramic frog that was supposed to sit on the edge. Ugly. I contacted the seller even before I unpacked it when I saw that it was an outdoor fountain. No response. Amazon refunded my money-NOT the seller. I am a loyal customer of Amazon, and purchase many different products from them, including my kindle and kindle books. I will remain a customer due to their outstanding service, but beware of this seller! I received a handwritten envelope a month 1/2 after first contacting them with a label to return the first fountain. I didn't respond to them. Kudos to Amazon, thumbs down to this seller!"
1,Do not get this translation!,"I feel that this is a horrible translation of an otherwise great work of literature. This translator felt the need to re-arrange pieces of Aristotle's work, and completely relocate some to an ""Appendix."" If you find this appalling, then you need to find another translation. However, if you are fine with the butchering of another person's work, by all means, order this book."
5,Loved it so much I gave it away and need another for myself,"This book really opened my eyes. It enabled me to eat whenever I get hungry and feel good and be thin all at the same time. It's not a diet - it's all about listening to your bodies signals.If you've been stuck in the world of dieting - starving yourself or food-obsession or so-called ""overeating"" - it will teach you how to let your body take control and become the thin person you're able to be. It teaches you how the body works and how, for many people, your body has adapted to store fat for the next possible famine (your self-created famine, called a ""diet"") AND best of all, how to change your ways so that your body will adapt to a world with unlimited food availability and stop storing fat - oui-la! a thin body. This book is out of print and people are still buying it and following it. It was written in 1991 and I'm writing this in 2002!"
5,A second book on the parables from Chappell,"Chappell's second book on the parables of Jesus! 14 new parables come to life in sermons. Each logically outlines, fully illustrated, drawing strength and truth from the words of Jesus. Among the parables addressed: the Friend at Midnight, the Hidden Treasure, the Laborers, the Unmerciful Servant, Counting the Cost, the Prodigal Son, the Elder Brother, the Sower, and others."
2,Dry and confusingly organized.,"This book was dry, and the way it was organized often left me confused. I picked it out to do some background reading on Turkey before traveling there ... It was not good for that."
4,A well-written thriller!,"I hadn't read a Jennifer Cruise novel until now. I have been told that her writing is unique and she has great attention to detail. Having read Fast Women, her new novel, I have to agree with those who recommended her books.Nell takes a new job as office manager at a rather old-fashioned firm. Gale, her boss, doesn't take the fact that Nell wants to redo his office surroudings lightly. However, things change in a drastic way when Nell and Gale begin a steamy affair -- an affair that takes some twisted turns when murders and mysteries begin to arise.Well written and entertaining, Fast Women is a reading investment. I am pleased with her work, and so I will try her earlier work."
4,I liked it!,"I know that alot of people aren't thrilled with this book, but I really liked it! It is a quick and easy read, and the characters are funny. Crusie has a way of making things funny, like the dognapping scene. She also managed to weave things together in the murders. I recommend it!"
1,Time I'll never get back.,"I'm not so enamored with this book as many other reviewers are. I reached the middle of the book before I realized I didn't care for any of these characters. I found the rest of the book a chore to get through. The way these family members slept around and who was related to who made my head spin. I don't know how this detective agency even made a profit-or even O & D Law firm. The book's title absolutely makes no sense. The pacing was mind-numbingly slow. Margie seemed like a shell instead of a real character. There was only one scene I thought was funny, the rest I kept rolling my eyes. The only character I found mildly entertaining was Riley. Plus, being an animal lover, I had a real problem with Nell stealing and keeping someone's pet. Twice she had the opportunity to return the dog, but failed to do the right thing. And the murder plots? I found them to be profound jokes as well as the author's obsession with china. Skip this one if you can."
2,Mediocre,"I haven't read all of Jennifer Crusie's books but did enjoy ""Welcome to Temptation"" very much. ""Fast Women"" was Ok. The book had momentum...I just expected more than I got. Uninteresting characters and simplistic plotting. If this was the first book of Crusie's I'd read, I probably wouldn't read another. Especially at hardback prices."
3,A sweet Love story,"I had my doubts about this book halfway through but what a finish. This is a story of divorce, murders, sex and finding love. Nell has been divorced for over a year and starts working at detective agency - and then the story folds out. The humor that is in most Cruisie books is more reserved. If you were looking for standard funny and entertaining Jennifer Cruise I would recommend Faking it , Temptation or Bet Me instead. I love Jennifer Cruise and will read anything she writes -- I am hooked."
1,Terrible characters,"I finished ""Getting Rid of Bradley"" and I couldn't wait to read another Crusie novel. Oh Lord! This was the wrong one. The characters were awful. I read it to get through, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. The fact that the hero discussed wanting to seriously BEAT the heroine is not a sign of true love to me. I could go on, but it's all terrible, so why bother? I'm going to read ""Faking It"" to give this author another try, but if it is as bad as this one, I'll never waste another minute with her."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"Sorry, but it did nothing for me. If you are looking for a good J. Crusie book then try ""Welcome To Temptation"" or ""Manhunter"". I would also recommend her older single category titles. You can still find them at the auctions and they are all worth it.This book fell very flat for me. I'm glad I checked it out at the library and did not have to pay for it. The story was more fantasy than fiction and the character's were dull and underdeveloped. Especially Gabe, what's up with this guy. Actually most of the people in this book were self-absorbed and immature. The mystery, if you can call it that was weak. I can't recommend this book to anyone, yet there do seem to be some die-hard fans that like it."
3,Wasn't Typical Crusie Book,Not as good as some of her other books like Welcome to Temptation and Faking It but it was still good. It was more a mystery type book than a romance novel. I'm not going to write a plot summary. Amazon has one above. I just got tired of characters fighting and whining. It was just a couple characters. It was all of them. I'm hoping this isn't where Crusie is going with her writing. I would recommend it just because it's better than most books in this genre. Just not what I was expecting from her.
1,Yawn . . .,"I really enjoyed ""Welcome to Temptation"" and after reading some of these reviews, I'll try some others (""Getting Rid of Bradley"" and ""Bet Me,"" and ""Faking It"").BUT this book was pointless, no mystery that I cared about, frustrating to read of Nell's harping and temper tantrums, and just meandered waiting to be put to sleep or something. I ended up skimming the last third of it. Yawn ..."
4,fast women,Slow in the beginning but it got very intriguing and very funny an hotttt! Great book. My husband listened to the audio version with me. Fun! Great job Jennifer!
4,First Wives' Club with a senser of humor,Three aging women friends by marriage bond over china patterns and dognapping while maintaing a body count. Takes off quickly and keeps rolling through the end. A fun read.
3,Fast Women,"I'm a Jennifer Cruise fan, but this book was just OK. Truly enjoyable parts mixed with oh, no!..that's just wrong...it's just wrong to steal someone's dog and even worse to keep it once you've discovered your purpose for stealing it was misrepresented. And, while I don't think this is the worst book, I am not sure I'll reread it."
2,Not a big fan,I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie but this book just didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad per-se but it wasn't very good either. I did finish it however I was tempted to quit several times.
3,Fast Women,"This book was okay. The mystery part was okay. The romance part was lukewarm. The best thing about this book was the friendship between the three women. I would try another of this authors books because they are fast reads, but will not pass this one around to friends."
4,Frozen Treat,"In Fast Women, Nell Dysart, a recently divorced 40-something, starts a new life as the office manager of a detective agency in the German Village section of Columbus, Ohio. She is an master of organization, style and bossiness, but she's met her match (and her soul mate) with senior partner Gabe McKenna. The book winds it's way though family and business troubles with a strong supporting cast of characters, some laugh out loud dog stories, and some chilling suspense.I generally do the audio versions of books, but ended up reading the paper version of this one. I wasn't thrilled with the audio reader's voice, which made all of the men sound like angry guys from the 50s and the women sound like they were 50. The book in paper version, however, was a great Crusie read."
3,Kinda predictable but another fun Crusie outing,"Nell just passed 40 and is suddenly a single divorcee. With the aid of her former brother-in-law, Nell takes a job at the crumbling McKenna detective agency and immediately sets about to ""clean things up."" Reticent owner Gabe is not really happy about the sudden whirlwind of organization that has befallen his agency, but soon just says ""uncle."" Some really witty bantering, sleuthing, murders, affairs, sex in the office, dognapping, and eventually love transpire to keep these two together as Nell sets about resolving some old and seemingly unsolvable crimes.Jennifer Crusie is always a must read for me. Gabe and Nell make a dynamic duo, and it was nice to have a heroine that no longer has her baby teeth taking center stage, even if the story was a little predictable. Overall, it is a 3.5 star novel."
4,"Hot, Hot, Hot",Fast Women is the first book by Jennifer Crusie that I have read and I am sure it will not be the last. Some of the scenes in this book between Nell (a newly divorced woman) and Gabe (the set in his ways detective) are sure to make you blush. I enjoyed the mix of romance and mystery. Fast Women is a great summer read.
3,Not her best work,"Okay, maybe I am biased after reading Welcome to Temptation about a million times and it being the best book ever, but Fast Women fell short. It just wasn't as funny as her other books and didn't have the same can't-stop-reading energy, which makes it just another romance novel about a divorced woman finding herself. There were to many characters and all the subplots were way to confusing. This is not one of her best books. If you want a good book by Jennifer Crusie, go read anything else she has written."
1,Don't waste your time reading this book.,"This book was LOUSY. It lacked character, was stupid, far-fetched and had no point! I'm sorry I wasted my hard-earned money on it."
4,entertainingly fast summer read,"As the back cover carries the words from Redbook magazine ""A beach book for your brain...a sexy, intellectual read."", so do the inside pages! A hard-to-put-down book, FAST WOMEN, is the story of a divorced woman who is suffering terribly. With the help of her two close friends she lands a job as a secretary with a detective agency. She is given the chance to live again---she discovers herself, what she wants, doesn't want, likes, dislikes, etc. and discovers her abilities as a woman to take a stand. Not to mention she discovers her soul mate by the end of this fun novel.Some scenes could have been cut shorter or more developed, but that can be the case with any book, so I got past that and continued through, only to discover myself a quick, entertaining,empowering,and uplifting read over my summmer vacation! Check it out."
3,"Humorous, sexy, and entertaining...","It's a fun read with humor, sexy scenes and overall entertaining. I agree with others that there are sooo many characters that it tends to be confusing at times. There were a couple of scenes that I felt uncomfortable with but I overlooked them and kept going. I have met a couple that was similar to Nell and Gabe so their relationship was not that unrealistic to me- Nell aggravated me alot of the times and I felt for Gabe. It was silly at times but, overall, it was a fun book to read."
4,"Quick, Fun Read","Humour, suspense, murder and romance. This book has it all.Nell Dysart is fading fast. She finds herself shuffling along through life trying to get over a divorce that she never saw coming. Encouraged by her best friends, she lands a job in what appears to be a run down detective agency.Gabe McKenna, stuck in the past, divorced but still sleeping with his ex-wife, is desperately trying to keep everything as it was. This not only includes his personal life but his detective agency founded by his father long since dead. At no time did he bargain for Nell and her entrance into his life.Throw in Nell's best friends who are somewhat dysfunctional, a case of dog napping gone awry and a mysterious past that brings all the characters together. What ensues is a fast paced story that I couldn't put down filled with twists and turns that are both funny and sad.I would have to rate this as my favourite Jennifer Cruise thus far. For anyone looking for a quick and enjoyable book, this is for you!"
4,Grab a cup of coffee...,"and sit down for this easy on the eyes, easy on the brain book. Crusie keeps the flow going and makes these guys grow on you! While it will not stimulate a rocket scientist.. it will definitely keep your attention and give you a smile. Nothing better for a rainy curl up in yer chair having a laid back day kinda read like this."
2,The earth didn't move...,"nor did it even shudder a bit when I read this rather vapid tale.No emotional attachment with any of the characters, a plot that SERIOUSLY strained credibility, and very bloated--a good editor could easily wipe out a hundred pages with no sweat. I have to give Cruise this: she does a good job writing steamy sex scenes. Other than that, the whole book was excrutiatingly predictable."
2,Waste of my time and money,"How dissapointing after reading reviews raving about what a great author Jennifer Crusie is. This book was so tough to get into, it was a struggle to make it through to the end. With each chapter, I'd hoped it would get better, but to no avail. The characters are dull, and the hero and heroine have no chemistry. A real dissapointment for romance lovers. Do yourself a favor and stick with Susan Elizabeth Phillips."
1,What am I missing?,"This book is trite as all get-out, with a gaggle of silly women to-boot. How can the owner of a detective agency not realize he's been embezzled by one of his employees? I made it to page 30 or so, and that was a chore. Maybe I should have given it more of a chance, but there are so many smarter books out there, so why bother? Sorry if you are truly a Crusie fan. I can usually find something good to say about a book, but not this one."
3,Definitely not her best work,"After reading a couple other Jennifer Crusie books I was excited to read Fast Women; unfortunately it fell short of my expectations. Several other reviewers already gave detailed info on the characters so I won't elaborate on them (just as we're all drawn to different people, I think you need to decide for yourself if you'll like a character or not).The book starts out funny but it takes a long time to get the momentum going, so much so that I almost didn't finish it - but I'm glad I did. There were times when I was smiling or laughing - enough so that my husband asked what was so funny. I think paring the book down would've helped to keep my interest level up but the last few chapters definitely drew you in and sped by much faster than most of the book.It's a good or ok read, not a great one."
5,Another blockbuster,"Jennifer Crusie scores another bestseller with Fast Women. I read this novel from cover to cover in less than 24 hours and enjoyed every single moment aside from the fact that the story does end. This novel has it all, laughter, hot/steaming love scenes, drama, suspense, murder and mayhem. What happens when two strong-willed controlling individuals get together? The sparks fly and Nell and Gabe stir up enough to start up their own passionate voyage into the world of romance. This novel has so much going for it that you won't want to miss out it."
3,"ok , not stellar",The main character s a woman who takes a job as a secretary then spends the whole book complaining that her boss treats her like a secretary. not her most endearing character.Not worth buying; ok to borrow.
3,janeto,"I've read Ms Crusie's other books and couldn't wait for this one to be published. I was disappointed. I was looking for the true-to-life, funny, predictable situations from ""Tell Me Lies"" and they weren't there. I sure hope J.C. goes back to her tried and true format with her next book."
3,coulda woulda,"This is my first Jennifer Cruisie book and while it gave me reason to look into here earlier writings, I can't really recommend this one. It's very complex at the beginning and really makes the reader work hard to keep the characters straight. While I liked the idea of strong women making their own paths, it was pretty obvious. I also agree with an earlier reviewer that the women just weren't that likeable! However, Cruisie's writing in itself is sharp and funny, which is why I'll look for an earler book and hope the plot of the next one is more focused and appealing."
2,"Very dark, matte, chrome.... LOL","You see the picture of these headers and opening the details page, you see 'comes in standard finish'. WOW. Flowtech has a nice shiny ceramic or stainless appearance as it's standard finish! What a great deal! Alas, it is not so. Upon opening the box, you find headers with cheap black paint. At least the comparable Hedman headers clearly state 'painted black, paint not heat resistant'. What's the deal? Are we trying to intentionally mislead people here? How the heck is the average buyer expected to know what constitutes a 'standard finish' on Flowtech headers especially if the picture does not depict the actual item? Sorry Amazon, this one is being returned. Seems like they would have been decent, but I bought the Flowtech instead of Hedman because I thought I was getting a great deal on a nice shiny finish."
3,"Where is the song ""Can't Stay"" from the first album.","How in the world can you call this a definitive collection without that classic song. This was a minor radio hit but first listen and it has hit all over it. Its not on here. Very disappointing hits collection indeed. Buy his proper albums. Trust me, you'll get more out of it."
