4,Bogus science?,"Just because the science presented in the book provides a different view, does not make it bad science. There are 23 contributors to the book, including 17 scientists, 14 of whom have PhDs in fields of geology, paleontology, biology, biochemistry, physics, and geophysics, from colleges like Harvard, Penn State, and Princeton."
1,Grand Canyon: A Liar's View,"This book provides yet another example of the delusion religious fanatics are willing to put up with for the sake of protecting their pet creeds. I will use examples from this book to illustrate the pitfalls of pseudoscience to my undergraduates at Northern Arizona University. It is a potent illustration of how willing fundamentalists are to LIE just to protect their version of a God who is purportedly interested in truth. Anyone who has spent a small amount of time objectively studying the geology of the canyon will come to the same inescapable conclusion: the so-called ""leading experts"" in the book are just liars for God.For the real stuff, see ""Grand Canyon Geology"" edited by Beus and Morales, Oxford University Press, 2nd Edition, ISBN 0195122992. Here are the real ""leading experts!"" The pictures aren't as nice, but at least there's a REAL commitment to TRUTH."
1,I thought it was a photo book?????,this book as religious content that was not mentioned in the description im sure some one may want a book about god makeing the grand caynon but i did not and had to return it
1,Bogus Science!,"The beautiful color photos in this slick book hide bogus science. This is a religious tract, pushing one view of Creation, hiding as science. The so-called geology in this tract does not stand up to peer review --- thus the self publishing. As geology this is a fraud --- it belongs with books on religion."
4,"Neneh Cherry pregnant, making career moves, good documentary","The Rise of Neneh Cherry is a documentary of the professional and personal life of Neneh Cherry. Many did not know, but Neneh was quite pregnant with her daughter Tyson while her single ""Buffalo Stance"" was climbing the charts. The viewer gets a glimpse of Neneh's life on the road doing interviews with the press and radio spots. Portions of life perfomances are shown and Neneh shows what a tropper she is belting out tunes during her 9th month and even performing during her third trimester. The video shows parts of the making of several her videos and includes the full length versions of the videos for ""Buffalo Stance,"" ""Kisses in the Wind,"" ""Manchild"" and a few other songs from her debut album Raw Like Sushi. The videos are scattered among the documentary, thus the 4 star rating, it's not easy to just watch the videos."
5,Mummy Acquaintences,"I purchased this book because I am acquainted with some of the mummies mentioned, and their biographer, although I am not an expert in the field. Ms. Pringle's book helped me to enhance my understanding of the world-wide and historical context of mummies. The manner in which she discussed the mummy researcher as well as his/her subjects made this book an interesting and lively read. It was scientific detail and human interest all in one story, tied with the thread of the Mummy Congress, a little-known and fascinating gathering. Good job, Ms. Pringle!"
4,Great Film!,"This movie was absolutely captivating. From the very beginning my attention was caught and lasted throughout the entire film. The whole build-up of the Jacob storyline was what really moved me. The one thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars was how the ending seemed a bit rushed. I feel they should have explored the feelings of all members of the family a bit more. I would love for them to make a sequel to this film about Sarah, Jacob, and Earnst going back into society. But all in all, it was a truely moving movie."
4,Best Hallmark film,"This would have to be my favorite Hallmark film ever (well ok... tied with Secret Garden). The movie is simply fantastic. The scenery, acting, and story are perfect. However, I couldn't give this DVD edition 5 stars because the Disc is practically empty. All it contains is the movie and a scene selection menu. In an age where we expect to see original trailers, filmographies, and ""making of"" featurettes, one cannot expect to be happy with a DVD this bare. The sound, although really nice, is a tad bit disappointing as well. With 5.1 as the norm, 2.0 doesn't quite please. I really wish that they had put a little more work into giving this wonderful film the release that it deserves. Still, this disc is the best way to see this masterpiece. If you love great stories, get it =)"
3,Wish it was e-book,"Good Book, quick read. It's a right to the point book which I really like. Also ending was good. Thank You"
4,"Good movie, bad DVD","I enjoyed this film very much... although it bears hardly any resemblance to the original film or book, it's very cleverly done. Plus, it doesn't hurt that the guys in this film are very good looking... wink wink.The DVD however... total bomb. There is nothing in it except the 'scene selection' and 'play film' options. I would have loved to have seen deleted scenes, or making-of's. I would have loved to see more of Andrew Lee-Potts (Jacob) seeing as he was my favorite character... but since the film itself is so good, I give the DVD 4 stars."
3,Too Long but Good at Times,"The VHS/Video version is MUCH BETTER - this DVD must include uncut scenes and the story drags. Still, my kids love the movie and at times I do, too but if you have a VHS player - go that route. Warning: Men hate this movie. Maybe more for kids and women who like some sappy parts in an adventure story."
5,Movie/ Stranded,"This is a fun movie, a take off or earlier type of Swiss Family Robinson Movie. I would recommend this movie for kids as well as adults. Kind of a fun family type movie. Thanks"
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!,"Here is my experience with this piece of junk: I bought it and it worked fine for a week. After that, it started to stick after playing two songs on any given CD, playing the same note over and over. I cleaned it, cleaned the CDs, played different CDs, tried anything to make it stop stalling. Finally,after 3 weeks of this, I snapped. I took it outside, threw it to the ground, and spent the next 20 minutes alternately jumping on it and smashing it with a hammer. You could GIVE me the $39.95 and I still wouldn't take it."
4,Nice,"This is cd/radio/alarm combo, perfect for the office or home. I bought it for my desk and I am please to say that the reception is very good. The building where I work is know for poor reception, but this radio has done very well. I will recommended for people that need a compact system and don't want to spend to much."
1,CDs always skip -- SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I purchased this model from Amazon about a year, and what a disappointment! For the price, I certainly wasn't expecting a top-of-the-line product, but this thing couldn't even perform the basic function of playing a CD -- no matter what the CD, it always skipped, perhaps due to the product's design which plays CDs in an ""upright"" position. Sound quality and radio reception were also poor. Its only use now is as an alarm clock in a second bedroom. Save your money -- there's better choices available in this price range."
1,only for a small room,"Purchased when I worked in a cubicle to use with headphones. Fine for that. Then put in my son's room. Horrible sound. I paid $9.00 for it on a military base, new. That is about what it's worth."
1,Noisy CD player,"This CD player / Alarm worked great except for the fact that it has a loud hiss most of the time that a CD is playing. We bought two and both had the hiss, so we are returning them. Looks and work well except for the hiss."
4,A Nez Perce Story of Lewis and Clark,"This story of Clark, of Lewis and Clark fame, and a Nez Perce girl named Rose, is based on Nez Perce oral history. It's the story of their love which results in a male child, who, if he existed, and I have no doubt that he did, became a Nez Perce, his white blood remembered only in the tribe's history passed on through the generations. I wonder if it would be possible, today, through DNA, to know who, if any, have carried on William Clark's genes.The expedition is followed from their meeting of the Nez Perce to their wintering over at Fort Clatsop on the coast and their journey back to Nez Perce country, but this fictional account begins and ends with Rose's point of view. Eunice Boeve author of Ride a Shadowed Trail"
4,A Truly Satisfying Read!,"The love story of William Clark and Rose of the Nez Perce is believable and filled with historical and cultural tidbits. It is great for both the novice and ""seasoned"" Lewis and Clark buff, as well as romance readers, in general. You can tell that Ms. Nipper did her research!"
1,Rubbish,"As usual, Steps have decided to torture the public by releasing another album. This album, along with all the others should only be bought to destroy, (it is very entertaining to hit it with a hammer). (...)"
5,You Know That You Want It,"This is a must have for any lover of fun pop music. Steps have come along way and proved that are not a one hit wonder, as many critics said they would be. Gold contains all of their hit singles (except, You'll Be Sorry :( my favourite), whioch means there are loads of top quality pop songs, like Tragedy, Better Best Forgotten and Chain Reaction. This cd is a must have for any christmas party and you can put it on and leave it and know that you are going to have loads of dancy and funky songs to dance/sing to"
5,"A pivitol work from the innovators of ""New Grass""","The first of four album releases from the group's last lineup, ""On The Boulevard"" manages to tie the group's past to the group's future. Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, Pat Flynn, and John Cowan maintain all of the essential elements which made NGR successful....most critically their penchant for expanding the envelope of progressive bluegrass beyond limits they themselves had set. The selections found here may showcase their astounding range and innovative interpretation more than any other album they produced; Soul, Blues, Reggae, Gospel, Celtic, Rock and other styles are incorporated, which are a testament. From their chemistry and artistic presentation to their musicianship, there are no weak points in this incarnation of The New Grass Revival."
5,Jaw-dropping!!,"After discovering the NGR ""Best of.."" CD by looking for the songs that Garth Brooks covered (Callin' Baton Rouge and Do What You Got to Do) I fell in love with this ultra-talented group.Since I bought that CD over a year ago, I was anxious for some fresh music. Looking at the lineup here, this seemed to be one of their strongest efforts. I just received the CD today and it is even better than I imagined. Every song is catchy, just like you would want music to be...without seeming hokey. The title song is simply awesome!If you're having doubts...just buy it...you won't be sorry."
5,Better Than Morphine,"The first time you hear Johnny shift into that crazy falsetto of his, ye shall die and go to heaven. These songs are better than a steady drip of morphine in the vein. The photo on the cover alone is probably better than most of the music you own, but believe me, it goes deeper...so much deeper than just that glorious cover. Did I mention that Johnny rocks a serious country feel on a lotta these tracks? Lord, my wee brain is starting to tingle just thinking about it. Come on now, buy this."
3,music good but disc chipped,the music was good until the last two tracks - the disc was scratched and I was not able to listen to the last 2 tracks
2,WTF,the handle was chipped and it weighs too much too use for practice use. tho for the price its a fun tool to show off ur skills to ur friends . not an authentic naginata
5,perfect,I was at Summerfest (one must do this!) in Milwaukee in 1982 or '83; already a huge CHICAGO fan and I had also discovered Bill Champlin. The band CHICAGO took the stage. I hadn't heard that Bill had come aboard. They started to play...I started to realize...the new voice and posture of the band was Bill...musicaly and vocaly.It was perfect!
4,Great CD from the Second Voice of Chicago,"While Bill Champlin never lived up to the success of his Chicago colleague Peter Cetera he did put out a few interesting albums most of which have been big in Japan due to the many fans of west coast and AOR(adult oriented rock there) Produced by David Foster who would go on to produce most of Chicago's albums in the 1980s it has a few good songs.The standout is a song co-produced by Kenny Loggins who Champlin bears a strong resemblance to (he has since shaved off his beard...) ""Take It Uptown"". It's a shame its now only on iTunes and avaliable as atwo hundred and fifty dollar import."
5,Don't run away from this album!,"I won't unveil how I obtained a copy, but this is truly a wonderful album! It's literally a mixture between Rock and old-school R&B. Every song on the cd is great. I first heard the numbers ""Take It Uptown"", and ""Satisfaction"" on his album ""Mayday"" (which is a wonderful live album for those who haven't heard it yet). If you can find a copy (as with any one of his albums) pick it up. Sorry, but those people who are trying to get $100+ for a copy are out of their minds. For crying out loud it's a cd, not the master recording! There is a difference between supply and demand, and just totally ripping people off! Pick one up if you can find it, I promise you'll enjoy it."
3,Was Expecting More,"As a 24 year-old ""Westcoast"" music fan, I was slightly disappointed with ""Runaway"".Perhaps it was the absence of songs that I needed to hear again immediately after they were finished( exceptions: Satisfaction, Gotta Get Back To Love, and Without You).Perhaps I was spoiled by the unequaled songcraft of Champlin-Graydon-Foster ( After The Love Is Gone, Paradise, Smile Again). Who knows? But don't let my review dissuade you, fans of Westcoast. This is still a good disk. But compare it to ""Airplay""(1980) or ""Pages""(1981) and tell me what you think."
2,God awful in comparison to so many others!,"This is perhaps the worst translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses I've ever read!Melville renders it into Verse, but all the sentences are jumbled and don't make sense, as well, he adds a weird type of archaic-ness throughout. It doen't make for easy reading or enjoyable reading either.I'd rather read Arthus Golding's translation to be quite honest!I think the best version on the market in Verse is Allen Mandelbaum's, and the best Prose translation being the incredible version by Mary Innes"
3,Line numbers would be helpful,"All the text is there and accessible, which is awesome, but I would have appreciated line numbers on the actual page as if I were reading the physical copy. That would make finding things much easier..."
3,Cumbersome translation,My rating is for the translation. It lacks vigor and elegance. The Mandelbaum translation is a far more involving and poetic rendering.
2,Not formatted for Kindle,"I had already had a trying day and was looking forward to sitting and reading Ovid on my Kindle. I took quite a bit of time to decide that this Melville translation was the one I wanted. So it came as an unpleasant surprise that this edition is not properly formatted for the Kindle. No matter how you adjust the font size, you will not be able to get the line breaks to occur as Melville intended them to. If you use larger type, it simply looks like a prose translation. In a smaller font, the line breaks are generally in the wrong place. In short, don't waste your seven bucks as I have, if proper poetic form -- rhythm -- matters to you.Through no fault of Ovid or Melville this Kindle book is not much use. And, by the way, as others have noted in several places, Amazon needs to grasp that a review of a translated work has to be listed so that it is translation specific, rather than the chaotic hodgepodge that currently exists."
2,ONE HIT WONDERS!!!!!!!,"This group of Philadelphia ""doo woppers' made it big in January of 1958 with a rock'n roll classic called ""Get A Job"". This cd contains the original recording and several other attempts at hitsville but as you can tell by listening, they didn't have it together for some reason. The follow-up to ""Get A Job"" was a song called ""Headin' For The Poor House"", that title sort of tells you what happened to the group. The only person to make any money from the hit ""Get A Job"" was the producer. The song was a ""fluke"" and the group never had a chance. So Sad!!!!"
5,Really a Great Music Concert,"It never fails that every time I play the compendium audio CD in my car, people start to hum along and always are like, ""Steve Miller?"" Firstly, I agree with the other reviewers that this band sounds great. Steve sounds awesome and the backing band are really tight. The crowd is loving it albeit waiting for Steve to play the classics. When he does everyone is dancing.I love the Steve Miller Band classics and he plays all of them here. The stage setup is uncluttered and neat. The lighting won't give you a headache and the audio on the DVD is really good. I just have a stereo system and have no problems with the two speakers. It is a little pricey, but it is a high quality a/v recording."
3,Audio is low,"The good. Yes, this is a terrific DVD. Nice selection of songs. With a few covers.The bad. As other reviewers have stated, could have played more of his work, and dropped the covers.Real bad. Audio does not play loud enough. Compared it to Cream, and others in my DVD collection, and it does not compare."
1,Steve Miller Band - Live in Chicago Failure to play,"After waiting 3 to 4 weeks for delivery, on arrival did not play due to a region fault. Now have to follow the returns proceedure and send it back to America at my own expense. If I had known there was this ammount of hassle, I would have bought it locally. I wont make the same mistake twice Amazon, you have just lost a customer."
5,"Best show ever!!!! Trust me, I was there!!!!","This concert is one of Steve Miller's best concerts EVER!!! I have been to plenty of his shows and this one tops them all!!! I was at BOTH nights at Ravina and the vibe was just amazing!! He was on the mark all night long!! I just danced all night long!! It was a perfect summer night, BOTH nights!!! I can't wait to relive it all over again with this DVD!!! The first night I was 10 rows back from the stage and all I have to say was ""WOW"", he was AWESOME!!! Even for his sound check, he was so critical to make sure everything sounded PERFECT!! The second night, I had lawn tickets and the vibe was just AWESOME....the crowd loved them!!! I have been waiting for the release for this video since they announced it (even though they said it was to be released by Christmas). This is a MUST have for any Steve Miller fan!!!!"
5,Great book for your gentle giant,"If you own an Irish Wolfhound or dream of owning one, then this book is a must have.Aside from plenty of practical information for the IW owner, the book is full of color pictures that are sure to satisfy the most exacting wanna be wolfhound owner.McBride does a good job of covering not only raising a puppy to an adult Wolfhound, but covers their quirks and the personality characteristics that makes devotees of those that love the breed. Whether you plan to show your hound or just love it as a pet, this book contains a comprehensive dialogue on health, obedience, personality, expectations and more.I own almost every hand book on Irish Wolfhounds published in the last fifty or so years and Mary McBryde's book truly the best!"
5,The Irish Wolfhound,This is the most comprehensive dog book of any kind I have seen. This book contains excellent information for both the curious and seasoned breeder of Irish Wolfhounds. The writer's perspectives should provide a good foundation for owners and breeders in helping to promote the long term vitality and proper growth of this breed. Excellent!
2,Excellent coffee but grinder died...,"I received this as a gift one year ago. The coffee is excellent and hot but I never liked having to go so close to the grinder to clean the grinder filter. Then, the 2 inch piece of plastic broke and now I can't even grind coffee. My attempts to purchase a new plastic piece from Krups have been fruitless, I've been told it's on backorder, 3 months ago and now I'm going to chuck the whole maker."
1,Waste of money,This item is waste of money and a blight on Krups' usually good name. The coffee grinder is extremely loud and difficult to turn off (it goes on and on). The grinder so much static that you have to dig the coffee grounds out. I would definitely pass on this item.
2,Don't believe a reviewer who's had it less than 6 months!,"They just haven't had their problem yet! We have now had three of these. The first worked beautifully for six months, then the coffee started to get really strong and it took a LONG time to brew a pot of coffee. Krups sent us a new machine, which lasted for four months, then the same thing. Krups sent us a third machine, which has lasted for six months. I suppose we could have another one sent, but the hassle of this is ridiculous. I just wish that Krups would either get the model to work correctly, or take it off the market. We bought Krups because of the name... won't happen again."
2,I wish it would last- great coffee - poor quality,I was so excited about getting this coffee pot- pulled it out of the box and imediatetly brewed the best cup of coffee I have ever had. Unfortunately the honeymoon ended early in less than a mounth with the ginding function just completely dead. I than returned the item to where I purchased it and got another one ( you know- just the unlucky pot) I have had this one for for about 4-5 months and the pot just grinds all day- now it has completely stopped brewing.I read all the reviews and knew that the coffee pot was high maintance- I was and am still ok with that - I just want one that will work. I am about to try a competitors brand- hopefulley it is better.
1,Krups - what happened to quality???,"This has to be the most disappointing coffee grinder/maker, that I have ever purchased. I thought that with the Krups name behind it, I would be buying a quality product, I was VERY much mistaken. I only purchased this a few months ago, and am now looking for a replacement."
2,What a pain,"I thought that I was upgrading to a better Krups model with this purchase. Not so. I like the option of having the built in grinder, but what a pain!The coffee machine is huge and is awkward to use anywhere near a kitchen cabinet. Additionally, once the brew cycle is done, you can't clean it without having water pooling around on the counter because of all the little compartments that build up the steam.For those who aren't real technical, stay away from this as well. There are two contact points on the coffee maker that must be in place or it will not run. Once is on the grinder lid (probably a good thing) and the other the hidden door which houses the filter.This makes great coffee and does a super job grinding the beans. I just don't have ten minutes each morning to spend cleaning the machine and the area around it.Bottom line, if you get this you'll be pleased with the coffee. Unfortunately, it's a real pain in the rear."
1,Great Coffee - awful design,"Loud as a dustbuster - wakes the whole family.Manual instructions must be followed exactly but in many cause is wrong or doesn't contain important infromation.Loading the 10 cups of water as reccomended overflows out the back.Steam cleaning causes so much condesation that unit always is soaked (as well as my counter top) - within a few days it had mold in places that were very hard to clean.If the thing is not cleaned and dryed properly, it will overflow the top of the unit with a coffee/water slurry the consistency of melted ice cream. Makes the most awful mess I've ever seen!It does make a great cup of coffee but other then that it's a peice of junk (no wonder it's price was reduced so much)."
1,Don't bother.,"Added this machine as the decaf mate to my Capresso grinder/brewer. The usually reliable Krups name let me down. Really messy and pain to clean. So many parts to reassemble and the hook that holds the metal coffee strainer broken already!This would be bearable if the coffee were up to par, but unfortunately that was not the case. Slooooow to brew, warm to hottish temperature. I guess I'll have to swallow the extra money and buy another, infinitely superior, Capresso."
3,"EXCELLENT CUP OF COFFEE, STUPID DESIGN","I have to say that this brews an EXCELLENT cup of coffee and the features are wonderful. HOWEVER, whoever designed this machine needs their head examined.The condensation that accumulates when brewing does NOT evaporate and the entire inside lid stays wet indefinately. If you do not take a towel and dry the whole inside of the grinder/brewer lift up part of the machine, your coffee beans will stick to the whole inside of the machine.If you don't mind taking the time to manually dry the machine before grinding, this will make an excellent tasting cup of coffee. The strength lever is a great feautre. I wish it had a timer, but it does not. Nor does it have an automatic shut off. These are important ommissions.If it was priced approx. $25.00 less it might be more of a value. But I am a coffee freak and can appreciate a great tasting cup of coffee and this machine delivers. :)"
1,Dont buy this,junk had it for 2 mo. then it took a dump it makes half a pot then the rest is just steam takes half a hour to make half a pot sending it back very sad coffee maker
1,Mine only worked for 3 months,"My coffee maker only worked for three months.I don't know what exactly went wrong with it but after awhile, it took over 30 minutes to make a quarter pot of coffee.It did make great coffee while it lasted."
1,NOT GODD,Oversized. Made okay coffee. Grinder more trouble than it was worth and stoppe working after 2 days. Returned mine. Most unsatisfactory purchase I have made in years.
1,Another unhappy consumer,"Well, here's another ""rave"" for this messy, poorly constructed machine. I'm writing this after the grinder snapped (a cheap plastic attatchment holds the metal grid in place,so when this goes, the grinder is shot.) We've only had the machine for six months and usually make coffee on the weekends so this is far from significant wear and tear. Try pouring the first cup without spilling some; it's a great test of your hand eye coordination...I fail every time. I wish I had seen these reviews before, but as this was a gift I would have probably just used it anyway. I'm currently checking othe reviews to see what a ""Good"" machine might be like."
1,Poor Design,I bought the Krups combination grinder and brewer thinking how nice it would be to combine the process of grinding and brewing into one machine. What a mistake! The grinder is the weakest point of the design. The beans do not feed easily into the grinder and become sticky because of the steam buildup in the grinding compartment. The machine is HUGE and will not fit under a counter. It is far too complicated an appliance for such a relatively simple procedure!
1,"Good cup of coffee, but horrible everything else","I had high hopes for this coffee pot, which probably led to my extreme disappointment. The only positive thing I'll say is it did make a wonderful cup of coffee. The negatives: it took way too long to make a cup of coffee (up to 30 minutes), put out an enormous amount of steam (leading to variable size pots of coffee day to day), and the product itself is comprised of cheap flimsy parts. The grinder plate broke on me within 3 months.All these plus the fact it was very messy. It threw coffee grounds into the water tank and I was constantly wiping up water and grounds off the counter.Krups was nice though and since this model is discontinued, they offered a new coffee maker (With separate grinder). They admited that this grind/brew model couldn't withstand day to day use.I bought a Cuisnart grind/brew now, and it's far superior, with loads more features, higher quality."
2,smedley,I bought this for my husband as a gift and it wakes the entire household (including the cat who is outside) on a daily basis. It is cumbersome and has way too many gadgets to enable it to brew coffee successfully. Filters plug up with grounds that have gone astray and the puring spout is too narrow and spills. I am truly surprised as one would think that after having a lock on the grinder business they could come up with a different design! Husband says it is a great cup of coffee though. I had 2 Toshiba's - one programable and one not which were far superior.
1,Works for 6 months..,"then the heating element dies. I have had two now, one was a replacement after the first went out (7 months of use) and now the replacement died after 5 months.Nice idea, but it doesn't hold up. And the cleaning and drying gets old...."
1,Poor Design,"I have owned the Fresh Aroma Coffe Grinder for approximately 5 months and have been extremely disppointed with the performance. As discussed in prior reviews this machine requires meticulous cleaning to work at all. Unfortunately, despite significant effort cleaning and drying after each use, we still have a constant problem with the water line clogging. As a result the machine produces a large volume of steam and very little coffee. I have not owned another household product that has caused so much aggravation."
4,Great Hummingbird Night-Light! No Heads Down In the U.S.!!!,"U.S. Power plugs are SUPPOSED to be larger on the left side. IF however someone mistakenly installed a power outlet upside down at a residence you currently occupy, then YES, unfortunately this nightlite must be used upside down. That is not faulty manufacturing, but rather inept electrical wiring of a residence. The item is awesome in it's beauty."
1,It must be used head-down ....,"I received it and there is a big mistake of its design! The left power pin is bigger than the right, you can't plug it into a socket on the wall, you must use it head-down.....what a stupid design... Don't use it in the US!"
3,Lots of spelling errors,"I enjoyed the book and am working my way through the next two in the series. However, there are more than a few spelling errors. The most egregious of which is calling Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque Kirkland AFB. Not once, but dozens of times. Well, at least he spelled Albuquerque correctly. This book really needs a good editor. The science is accurate."
3,"Engaging story, fair writing, poor editing","The story is scary and engaging. I found it to be particularly relevant as my work sometimes involves homeland security instrumentation. I think it is all too possible that something like this may happen or already be underway.As others have commented the book is full of technical details, which are essentially accurate as far as I can judge.The writing is just fair, and seems to go downhill as the book progresses. The editing is quite poor and there are many spell-check failures (incorrect words, probably due to automatic correction of editing errors).If you enjoy all-too-realistic techno-thrillers and can overlook consistent editing errors and mediocre writing, I highly recommend this book."
3,Rings Of Allah (series),"Rings Of Allah is a story about radical muslims attempting to nuke the USA. Well thought-out and mostly believable story. A Tom Clancy type book...where it's obvious that the author is well versed on nuclear physics and the various locations that the story takes you to. Characters are likable, lovable and hate-able...just like real life. Several interesting mini-stories taking place in Russia and the Middle East...all within the scope of the `big picture'.I had two problems with the book:1. Sometimes it got way bogged down in the details of nuclear bombs. I skimmed over a lot of that.2. It seemed like things fell into place a little too easily for the bad guys in the US. I don't think that smuggling-in and setting-up multiple nuclear bombs in the United States would be a very easy task. I'd expect some major unexpected hiccups along the way (no matter how well it's planned in advance).Having said all that, I still liked the story...and I'll be ordering Book II of the series"
2,Interesting plot,"Relatively juvenile and stilted with many typos and syntax problems. Good plot, just wish the author thought more highly of his reader. Kindle edition has a problem with the leading quotation mark (uses phrase rather than the quotation "" symbol), very disconcerting and further detracts from the storyline."
3,Where was the editor?,"This is a very fascinating study of what the Islamic terrorists may be planning for America and the author is obviously very knowledgeable in his subject. However, the horrible editing detracts from following the story line. For example, a government official's name is spelled both ""Blumberg"" and ""Bloomberg"" in the same paragraph. There are various droppped articles and just plain incorrect grammar. It is as though the editor was not a native English speaker and was relying on spell-check to edit the text. The words aren't spelled wrong, the words are just innapropriate in the context in which they are used. Oh well, I bought all three books in the series so I will see if the editing improves with the next two books."
2,Barely average,"Interesting premise, and technically accurate (actually found the technical discussions the most interesting part of the book), but as a novel is on edge of boring and for most part is poorly written and very poorly edited. Two-Stars only because it was somewhat prophetic and the overall story had potential. Would not buy it again but might read it if given to me."
3,So So,Hard to get through. Made it about half way through and that awas it. Very creative especially the beginning but loses its appeal toward the middle
3,Bucket Boss,"I purchased this for my Father and it was a good idea, but not necessarily for him. The Bucket Boss seems to be more of a nuisance and gets in the way rather than helping him out with holding his tape measure. I think the bucket overall is a good purchase, it just didn't work for my Father."
4,Tuff & Comfortable...,"The holder is sized too fit any 25 foot tape measure and it's comfortable to wear. I added it to my Bucket Boss Contractor's Rig that had a smaller holder. The belt is well made but it's small and may only fit a 30"" waist."
2,Left Unsatisfied,"Debra Farrington's guidance in finding a rule of life covers a great variety of topics, touching on almost any aspect of life one could think of. However, she just barely describes each one, dedicating only 2-3 pages for each subject, which seems to take away from the effect. I finished each section wanting more and felt like I didn't learn enough about them to get benefit from reading it. I knew what I needed to work on, but she didn't tell me how to work on it.I also question Farrington's motivation for writing this book. It could just be how I interpreted it, but her tone just seemed so full of pride. I felt like she worships because it makes her feel good for being a Christian, but not because she wants to praise God. This was very distracting for me, and I had trouble not noticing that the author of this book seemed to be writing it more for bragging rights than to help people grow closer to God."
3,Not ecumenical,"Don't be misled by the nondenominational title and the broad swath of the back-of-book blurbs (""help you discover your own spiritual path by drawing on the traditions of a wide variety of ancient and contemporary religious orders""). This book is Christian through and through, as are all the rules and orders mentioned, and in fact only a few different traditions are mentioned more than briefly once or twice. I don't even think any of the ""wide variety"" of orders mentioned are Greek Orthodox, much less from any of the non-Christian monastic traditions. Still, the book does offer useful advice for those of other faiths. Just be prepared to ignore the author's assumptions that all readers are Western Christians."
1,...,"Yeah... I didn't like this movie at all. The camera was just annoying. I understand wanting, like, a realistic camera or whatever, but they just made it way too shaky. And, the first part of the movie just dragged on and on, it was so boring. Just them partying, ya know, la-dee-da. It seemed like it was a whole hour, I know it really wasn't, but it seemed like it. Then, when they finally got to the monster, you can't hardly see anything, and by that time I'd already decided that the characters were just annoying. I really didn't care if they lived or died. The ending wasn't exactly satisfying either, I was actually annoyed by it. The effects were fine, but other than that, this movie just wasn't good... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,Horrendous garbage!,"This is by far one of the worst movie I ever seen and it's no surprise many people didn't like it either. The whole story line was poorly executed not to mention taking place through an effen camcorder on some guys shoulder through out the entire movie which makes many viewers so damn dizzy, no explanation where this monster came from it just happens so fast out of nowhere and the ending was so incredibly stupid. I heard rumors their coming out with a second one but I doubt it and they shoudn't bother with it either, This movie is AKA godzilla/blairwich project rip off.Save your money don't rent it and definently don't buy it."
1,Awful,"Despite this being the first new monster film in a while, I found it flat an uninspiring. I could barely stop myself from skipping through the chapters. Save your money."
1,I guess either you loved it or you hated it...and I hated it!!!!,"I was surprised to see that some people gave this 5 stars. To each his own, but it wasn't my bag! I wish I had never watched it."
2,Two stars off for a dumb director,"The person controlling the ""creative"" aspects of Cloverfield should be beaten with the piece of rebar he impaled one of his characters with. People don't run around after being impaled on rebar for several hours. Helicopters don't fall fifty stories and then have three survivors emerge from within to run around waiting to die. For this and many other implausibilities that go beyond the realm of suspension of disbelief I take away one star. I award a second beating with a piece of rebar to the side of the director's face for trying to be artsy and I take away a second star because the stupid, idiotic and nauseating camera technique did NOT make the story any better, it made the film hard to watch instead."
1,VomitCoveredField,"I'd like to thank the other reviews on Amazon.More negative reviews than positive? Rejoice.I do not understand why this movie received A ratings in papers and magazines.Were the reviewers conned into giving this movie and A by some need to fit in with a pretentious ""art"" loving hive mind? If so, then then I can only imagine that this hive mind is the same one that compels people to like fecal art and those square box kindergarten finger paintings hidden in the modern sections of every museum.Horrible nauseating camera shaking does not qualify as spectacular artistic genius.I have plenty of home videos from the 80's where my father left the camcorder on while he was walking, looks just like this.If I add a lump of purple clay that goes RAAAR and splice in some footage of buildings blowing up will you people pay me too?Horrible plot. Or lack of plot.Tons of plot holes.Lame five second explanation of what's going on.If you like B-list films, by all means."
5,Best movie I've seen this year....,But then again it's only February....Different! The camera movement did give me a bit of motion sickness - but that only added to the experience. Not sure how well this movie will play on a regular size television screen - I think seeing it in a theater is a must - especially one with a heavy duty sound system. Overheard someone at the theater say there might be a sequel.
1,One Crappy movie unless you like vertigo,I actually saw this movie at the theatre. I could barely watch for more than 10 minutes at a time. At one point in the movie because the continual movement of the camera i had to get up and leave.
1,Really Bad!!,"My God! How could anyone have watched this ""camera shakey"" film on the big screen? What a waste of time and money! As one reviewer said, some of the special effects were great, but what's with the hand held camera effect? ""Blair Witch"" had the same annoying effects, but compared with Cloverfield ... it was still frame!Where did the monster come from? Where did it go? Lots of room for a sequal, but who would ever go see a sequal to this really bad movie?"
1,Where's the Monster?,"I know it's become an annoying Hollywood cliché to wait until act three to show the monster, but in this one you see ONE shot of it's face as it's looking down at the guy with the camera and that's about it. Everything else is a quick glimpse.Was this someone's first film ever?"
5,Possibly the best ending ever.,"I don't know what's in the water in Hollywood these days, but filmmakers are _finally_ being allowed to make intelligent endings to movies. Remember how the ending to ""Blair Witch Project"" made the hair on the back of your neck stand up? And this year, you got the same feeling with ""No Country for Old Men""? This movie, ""Cloverfield"", gives you that same breathless feeling at the end. I mean, it's a Godzilla movie, so there's lots of monster stomping on NYC, but the sly use of the taped-over love story is absolutely brilliant. I think I teared up after that last scene.If Abrams can do this with a monster movie, I can hardly wait 'til his ""Star Trek"" comes out."
4,"Fun movies, solid extras","I'm a sucker for the fake/found footage genre, so Cloverfield was right up my alley. A movie of this type rises and falls with the believability of its performances and dialogue. For the most part, Cloverfield gets these right. There are some plot gaps and predictable but well-executed horror scenes. The FX are impeccable and shocking when the movie's budget is taken into consideration. Many far more expensive movies produce much less convincing visuals. The extras are great fun, lots of great behind the scenes stuff that shows just how much of the movie (a lot!) was not on location but on a sound stage."
3,Interesting monster movie,"I watched this on video on Demand on Cox over the Halloween weekend, after reading some reviews here. The monster looked to me like a cross between a praying mantis and a dragon, but seemed believable as a newborn, with limbs ridiculously out of proportion to the rest of his body, clearly confused, lost, and really, really pissed at being shot at. I had to pause it a few times because the herky-jerky Blair-Witchy film style made me dizzy, but it was still a clever little movie, and I found it well worth my time."
4,Clutter-field,"I went to see this movie right after a visit of a modern art museum. This movie caught me still in a creative mode/mind so I give it 3.5.The scenario begins with a lost-and-found tape recording a party of the protagonist's friends as a spider-liked monster spawns its attack in NYC.The whole movie is presented by a video camera with an amazing battery life and features with a night vision?! Inevitably, you will experience some motion sickness while watching this flick as well as a mind-twist--a theme of this movie. Friendship? Romance? Or a 911 of a mutation monster?At the end, it even leaves a clue for a sequel in the video tape, and I can't help but wonder what would that be? Another video taping story?The credit should give to this brave director who makes it fun to watch as if it's a virtual reality SciFi game and laugh about several lame actions and conversations."
2,Oh my Godzilla!,"In my opinion The Blair Witch Project was all hype over substance and I found it neither scary nor entertaining. Cloverfield is likewise a more clever piece of marketing than cinema. The problem I have with movie fiction masquerading as real amateur footage is that it can actually seem less real. Because I know it's not real the fly-on-the-wall style intrudes on my ability to suspend disbelief and I'm constantly aware that I'm watching a work of fiction. Maybe I'm unusual in this but heck, I can't help that. Having said all this Cloverfield is better than TBWP. If you can ignore the tedious first 20 minutes, the excessively shaky camerawork, and the irritating characters, there's just enough spectacle to make it worth watching."
2,The worst Godzilla movie is 10x better than Cloverfield,"First of all run for your lives!!!! If a monster invaded my town and friends were dying I sure would not video tape it.The movie starts off good enough and the first 15 minutes are easily the best. The movie starts off as a love story and the main character taped his first date with his love. The video is than shot over when the monster attacks New York. This is somewhat of an interesting idea using the old video footage to tell the back story.However things go from good to really bad in the blink of an eye. Much like the Blair Witch the character is running with his video camera and the movie is shown thru his camera. This causes several jerky scenes and I thought I would have a siezure.All in all the movie was not beliveable, the movie was not very realistic (ok a monster attacking is not realistic to start with), who video tapes themself running for their lives?"
1,"bad movie, not even worthy of renting it","Beautiful people, nice cast and story.But the way the movie was filmed is very unconfortable to be viewing."
1,IT REALLY SUCKS!!!!!!!,"Watching this movie was big waste of time. The camera was the biggest problem. All I saw was the camera moving and shaking all over the place.Plus, you didn't get a chance to actually see what was going on, with the guy holding the camera constantly moving. I was waiting for him to either drop the camera or get killed by the monster. When was real movie going to start?The person who directed this movie was a fool, because he should have ended the camera at the party. So Don't buy the DVD or go to the movies, because it STINKS!!!!! and a big waste of TIME!!! and $$$$.Arberdella"
1,Wasted Money,"I along with others waited paitintly for the movie to come out. When I went to see it, I was really disappointed along with my friends. The only way that they can salvage this film is to make a part 2 based on where it left off and use some better actors, a dialogue and a steadier camera. Reminded me of some of the old Grade ""B"" movies made in the 50's and 60's that I have watched. I guarantee you that unless you are a photojounalist and this was your paycheck, that there is no way you would continue to shoot and hold onto a camera when you are crapping your pants to get away and save your life."
1,This one is organized like HOGAN'S GOAT!,This has to be considered the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE movie of the 2007 season. It was a total waste of time & $$$$$!
1,BIGGEST CON GAME!!,"I just watched Cloverfield. I'm not saying it's the worst movie I have ever seen, but I can't remember when I hated one more.Why the film makers thought it was a innovation to film it with a hand held camcorder(BLAIR WITCH PROJECT) is beyond me.But, I guess my main objection is one of us isn't ""getting it"".In the ""monster"" movies of the past, there was a reason. Atomic bomb, bad experiments, etc. etc.. In this movie, there are no why's, from where(?) and how come.Also, is it a law that only stupid people can be in the modern horror movies. You know, the ones who go back for cat, or piece of jewelery or something insignificent worth risking your life for.One other final note. The movie is 83 mins.( way to long), but 11 mins are the credits.I wonder if people would flocked to the theaters or rent the movie if they're told the truth. ""This movie was shot on a camcorder, you hardly ever see the monster, you get to watch a bunch of stupid people run around NY for 72 mins."""
1,One of the worst movies ever seen,Do not waste your time (and money) watching this movie...one of the worst movies i have seen in many years...
1,wasted an hour or so of my life!,"This is by far, the worst movie I've ever seen!!!!!! I knew it wasn't going to be too good, but wow! And they wanted to make this so America would have a ""Godzilla"" of our own!!??!?!?! What on earth!? More questions than answers. It sucked so bad!!!! And I wasted a free ticket for my Redbox account. MAN!"
1,Cloverfield,"I think this show was totally a waste of time and money. Most of the time the camera was jittering all over the place. I can't focus on the video properly most of the time. This show was a complete nauseating movie or homemade video production. As this cover of the DVD was quite interesting, I watched it on a DVD rental and I did not buy this video at first. When I watched the first 30 minutes of the show, my eyes were getting tired focusing on the screen. It was exactly like a movie I saw quite a long time ago about some witch project thing. Its has no plot except people running around screaming, yelling and shouting. Just does not make sense."
1,Cloverfield,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I am so glad it was inexpensive. The acting was fair, the story line was virtually invisible, and the cinematography was (well if you could call it that) terrible!"
2,Meh.....,"the way the movie was shot was entertaining. I actually enjoyed looking at the movie. Other than that, the story plot was a total waste of my time and the only character I honestly cared about was the one holding the video camera....I was actually glad when everybody else died, it was that painful to watch.The most painful part of the movie to watch was the very beginning, at the party scene. That poor attempt for character development and cliche drama was just a tad bit much. I think that scene was a full 20 minutes, or was it 30? Who knows, it was too long."
2,Bad directing. Could have been a good horror movie.,"What was the director of Cloverfield thinking when he decided to film this movie from the perspective of a hand-held movie camera? All the way through, the almost constant jerking, jumping, and swerving of the camera made my eyes hurt and my head swim. Half of the time, I couldn't tell what was taking place. The Blu-ray video transfer was not very good, but the audio was fantastic. Great effects from the rear channels.The best thing about this film are the CGI effects and the well-designed creatures. Hats off to their designer. Too bad, the director ruined the movie filming it in this fashion, as this was possibly the best giant monster-creature I have ever seen. The ending is abrupt and leaves one with a sense of dissatisfaction and no closure. What a shame! It could have been a great horror flick!"
1,Nausea-Inducing and Plotless - and Those Are Its Good Points,"Halfway through this movie, I went to the bathroom to throw up. That essentially describes both the nausea-inducing camera work and the nausea-inducing lack of plot, sensibility, or character in Abrams' movie. Some claim that the lack of explanation of the monster's origin, motives or character are a convincing portrayal of 21st century angst. Myself, I think it's just bad writing. And who cares whether these whiny socialites live or die - I was rooting for the monster the whole way through."
1,Horrible,"I rented this movie thinking that it was going to be spooky and suspenseful, considering how little they led on about the movie, I thought it was going to make it that much better. Well, just to rent the movie cost me less than a dollar, but I still want a REFUND! This is the only movie I'd say don't waste your time with. Don't even rent it. 2nd worst movie I've seen in my entire life."
1,"Now that the hype is over, it can finally be said.","This movie really isn't very good. The shaky-cam conceit is annoying, the plot makes no sense, and it's incredibly difficult to care about any of the self-centered yuppies that the movie revolves around. Sadly, it was the center of so much Geek Anticipation prior to it's release that nobody dared say anything bad about it. Still, the fact remains that I've yet to meet a single person that wanted to see this thing a second time."
2,"A bad Godzilla clone, shot from first person perspective","My wife and I saw this in the theater. The handcam viewpoint almost made my wife ill with the shaking and occassional spinning around looking for the bad guys. I just thought it was cheesy - an attempt by a usually good director to jump on a supposed hot trend. When you are shooting a monster movie where you are supposed to SEE and CARE about what they are running from, giving the audience a good shot of the monster for a few seconds TOTAL TIME is... lame (I have no better polite word for it).I would not recommend this movie to anyone except a diehard fan of the director or someone that just has to have every movie of a particular genre."
1,Don't waste your time watching it.,"Until I went to see this movie, I had never before witnessed half of a theater audience getting motion sickness from a film. Unfortunately I have now. I have to say this is the worst film I have EVER seen. For those who thought that Battlefield Earth was the worst movie in history, after you experience this film you will change your opinion. It is terrible."
1,NEGATIVE STARS,"this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched. this will be my first one star review. the whole movie is shot with one hand held camera. it is hard to tell what is going on half of the time, when they run you pretty much just see there feet , alot of the shots you have to tilt your head to watch , 80% of the movie is just interviews , it has no ending it just stops filming , do not waste your time . I noticed that this movie only cost a dollar on Amazon , do not waste your dollar ! I checked this out from the library and I feel as if they need to give me something for watching this horrible movie. I didn't like the way the Blair Witch was filmed but this is much worse . the whole movie is you looking through the camera from what the annoying camera man sees . over 200 people gave this one star , the numbers don't lie !!!!"
1,EXTREMELY AMATEURISH & BORING TRASH FILM,"This is by far one of the worst movie ever made. The plot is extremely amateurish and boring. Don't waste your money or time with the piece of trash. The entire movie is a bunch of teens talking and running in the streets of Manhattan, away from a perceived creature that you only have a very fast glance at. Not even worth a single star !!What a TOTAL RIP-OFF !!!"
1,not what i expected,couldnt watch the whole thing.. hud was running around with a camera the whole movie and it was making sick!
1,HORRIBLE...,"This was one of the worst movies that I have seen in a while.Who, what, when, why... I DONT KNOW IT DIDN'T SAY! and that bothers me.AWEFUL. sorries."
1,YAWN .... Wake me when its over,"The title says it all.EVERY TIME I tried to watch this movie, I wound up falling asleep!!(at least I know what to watch IF I ever have insomnia - There's ALWAYS something positive in every negative)I tried 3 different times to watch this movie. NO LUCKFINALLY, on the FOURTH attempt (with a friend who really wanted to see it) I drank one of those little 5 HOUR ENERGY things. (They WORK)BUT, it was a mistake!! I should have just let myself go to sleep and ignore my friend. (BTW, my friend did NOT like the movie either - She wound up falling asleep - LOL!!!)"
1,Should have been a TV Movie...,"There is absolutely nothing special about this movie. The acting (if you could call it that), story, and handy cam gimmick are nothing new. The movie is short and trite and has the feel of a bad TV movie. Sure they spent a few extra dollars on special effects but they are few and far between and have nothing that stands out. Most are dark half glimpses of the bland looking monster hiding behind a building. I cannot see why anyone would give this movie more than a quick glance, unless they are 14 year-old youtubers who think horror remakes are the s--t."
2,Cloverfield,"This film was enjoyable, but it lacked realism. I don't recall if they first ever figured out where this creature came from. I saw several editing errors. It was fun to watch, but it was a cheap effort to reflect on the old Japanese horror films (i.e. Godzilla)."
1,Cloverfield,This movie isn't what I thought it would be. Blair Witch Project was way better then this movie. I would advise everyone to rent it out before buying it.
2,I have to agree with the majority of reviewers....,"Cloverfield did not live up to its hype in my opinion. Maybe it's because I watched the dvd rather than see it the theater, but I just kept feeling that it was a leadin for another movie. Of course, watching the ""extras"" I got it that they had a very limited budget, and I have to give the production props for very good cgi work. I just expected more."
2,Like playing a xbox game,"I thought this looked good but when I watched it, it just gave me a headache. It was like watching a video game on the xbox. This movie was plan horrible, even to rent it."
2,fun,"I liked it. I didn't mind the wobbly camera thing (I barely notice these things any more anyway). The thing that made me annoyed was seeing too much of the monster! The first couple of glimpses of him are enough, but instead we get this kind of idiotic American-movie 'got to see him over and over' and reach the climax we do. I was expecting the tricks to spook me and when they came I failed to get spooked because I had predicted how I would get spooked. Well everyday sort of hack filmaking - but still not a bad effort."
1,cloverfield,"I just saw the movie. I donot like this movie. The camera angels where bad. It was not anywhere near as good as Godzilla. Not much action just a lot of running and seeing threw the eyes of the camera. You did not see the monster destroy buildings. You did see a little bit of the monster now and than. I think this movie was made to see just how bad a movie can be made. If I could give a negitive in the stars I would. If the movie was shown buy the Army or Monster point of view it would have been a lot better. Poor writing, Poor Camera angels. One long boring Movie. Save your money and get a real action dvd. Like anything else."
1,"Waste of time, money, and resources","Over hyped, horrible movie, with a worse ending. That sums it up, do not waste your time on this, it is 1.5 hrs of my life and $4 of my video on demand I will never get back."
1,Junk!,Imagine making a movie with a hand-held camera? Are these guys kidding? Don;t waste your time; How did they get this film on the market?
1,what the ?,"I really like the ideas behind this movie. i could really care less if we ever see the big bad monster but they picked the wrong people to follow around. next time they should just name the movie ""retards with a camera"" so we all know what we are going to be paying for. part of the time in this movie the the camera guy, Marmaduke from Carpoolers, has the camera pointing at the ground or they are running in the dark. nothing the characters do is believable at all nor are they even likeable. just save your time and money with this one."
1,"Cloverfield, far too hard to watch","I tried to watch this movie twice but I had to turn it off after twenty minutes.It was too handheld which is too bad, because the story had potential and it could have been a good movie if it was made better and less jumpy. Didn't they have a stabilizer in the camera or something like that?"
1,Really bad.,"Silly, stupid, not scary, if you watch the extra's (because I wanted to see what their motive was for making such a bad film was, Godzilla, since Japan has a monster the USA should have one, I ain't kidding! Also the monster was suppose to be a Baby monster that was scared and that's why it was running around crazy.) Do not waste your time or money, thank God I didn't as I rented this garbage from the Public Library for free."
2,More like a commercial for Tylenol,"This is a simple review. See ""The Mist"" instead.Cloverfield is a boring one and half hour of headache inducing nothingness. There is only one good scene in the movie which I won't ruin should decide to waste money and buy or rent this.You see ""the creature"" briefly. Instead you follow a bunch of morons trying to be the next Blair Witch Project in New York.So if you want a great monster flick that serves on many levels do yourself the favour and see The Mist instead."
3,monster should have eaten the cast right away,"I thought the concept of the movie was brilliant, and I really enjoyed the monster trashing NYC. The only drawback was the collection of slacker, twentysomething, dude-esque nincompoops running around in front of the camera. The monster should have knocked off these folks right away. Next time, let's have way more monster and way less nincompoops."
2,A problem in presentation,"The idea, conceived by producer J.J. Abrams, is brilliant, and the story told here is exciting, riveting stuff. It's tense and, at times, genuinely scary. If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film.The problem is in the presentation.Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit.No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor"
2,Yuppies screaming oh s*** oh s***,"The camera is irritating, the characters are annoying, and all they do is run around screaming ""oh s*** oh s***"" and ""oh my god oh my god"". Seriously, I watched this with closed captioning and you could predict what the next caption would read.The beginning of the movie drags with twenty minutes of boring dorks partying, then it consists of them lurching from one whammy to another while you hope for them to die.The only thing that saves this from being one stars is that some money clearly went into the special effects. It was entertaining to see New York City get smashed up."
4,good plot but causes vertigo,"Cloverfield is an interesting film, the shakiness of the camera is not for those who get sick with moving/shaking images but the plot is well developed and the characters are memorable."
3,GOOD MOVIE!!!!,It was a good movie... It was different than your typical film because you the viewer watch everything through the view of a camcorder as if what you were seeing really happened. You experience everything with the guy holding the camera from his moronic interactions with those around him from the fear of running from the chaos created by the monster.Beyond that the special effects were great from the decapitated Lady of Liberty to the monster(s).I would have probably given this movie 4 stars had their been more screen time of the monster. While watching the film I was a bit frustrated because I wanted to see more of the monster as opposed to people running away from it.So....
3,Clover Takes Manhanttan,"This film is definitely not for everyone. If you hated 'The Blair Witch Project' then you'll probably hate this as well. The entire film is shot on hand held cameras so if you're prone to motion sickness, you should steer clear. Personally, I really enjoyed this movie. It was original and completely different from your average horror/monster film. I thought the cast did a good job and the film felt like it was unraveling as you watched it in real time. The special effects were very good and the director's use of the low light levels and the ""less is more"" monster shots were extremely effective. Even when you did see the monster clearly, you couldn't really wrap your brain around it. I think Clover may go down as one of the coolest looking monsters ever. If you are a fan of monster flicks then you will probably enjoy this but keep those camera shots in mind."
4,Entertaining,"First of all if you didn't know this movie was shakey before you saw it, you are an idiot. This movie had one of the largest viral marketing campaigns ever. Secondly, I have seen this movie several times, including the theater (which it was awesome at), and have not once gotten sick or even close to feeling like I was going to be sick. For one, it's only about an hour long. Have you not watched home movies that were that shakey for an hour??? Yes, it's kinda dumb the guy would be carrying around a camera during all this, but if he didn't guess what??? There's no movie. I thought it was creative, and a dang good entertaining monster movie. You can't help but get some chills when the monster first attacks and you see the statue of liberty's head going rolling down the street. I'm really surprised at all the bad reviews this movie is getting on amazon. I guess we just need another romantic comedy."
2,TAKE SEASICK PILLS B4 WATCHING!!!!!,This film would have been quite enjoyable if not for the cliched jerky spinning hand held camera gimmick that made us all sick in Blair Witch...it's really over the top in this movie and why arent we seeing films shot during the day....it wudda been just as scary especially the scene in the subway tunnel!!
1,Forgetful.,"This movie is so bad. When I say bad, I mean bad as in not cool and not good in any way shape or form.I read the reviews and I thought this could be a really great movie - only to be extremely disappointed. The camera action (jitter) was probably put in afterwards to hid the fact that this movie sucks. Its boring, the dialog is horrible and a waste of time.Thankfully, I skipped forward to get through it. Unbearable. Its a movie so bad the movie pirates skipped it. That's how good it is."
1,Waste of time,If the jitter camera shots don't make you puke... the story will... i had such high hopes for this movie... skip this one.
1,nausiating movie,"Crickey,I felt bloody sick within half an hour of watching this(vertigo from all the camera motion). Definitely a low bvudget movie - wish I had known before buying it."
1,Unwatchable,If I had known this was shot in the Blair Witch style of camera work I wouldn't have hought it. I couldn't get through 15 minutes of it. The handheld camera work made me nauseous. I expect to see this dud in the 2 for $10 bin at WalMart very soon.
2,Doesn't Play by It's Own Rules,"I notice that the raving Amazon editorial review starts off by saying Cloverfield doesn't play by the usual rules. Well, it doesn't play by it's own rules, either. The film is totally reliant on a gimmick that it doesn't even use properly. Supposedly the ""cam corder view"" is an attempt at hyperrealism, but all it succeded in doing for me was take me out of the moment time and again. There is nothing at all ""realistic"" about a hand held camera that always catches every important event and facial expression and that never gets dropped even when its operator is running through wreckage, dodging monsters and leaping from building to building.This movie was no better than any number of Made For Sci-Fi Channel TV movies I've seen."
2,Little Bit Disappointing!!!,"First of all this movie was made in 34 days (Watch 'The Making of Cloverfield' on DVD and you will see what I'm talking about, but I can slide that thru, since most of it was special effects. Second of all people didn't really like it for several reasons:1) TOO SHORT2) NOT BLODDY ENOUGH3) HANDHELD CAME VIEWThe only reason that I somewhat like this movie is because:1) VERY NICE SPECIAL EFFECTS2) LIKE THE MONSTER3) LIKE THE LOCATIONThis is to the people who made 'Cloverfield'If you're going to make a sequel, please concider these several things:1) MAKE IT AT LEAST 1hr50min2) WE WANT TO SEE MORE BLODDY SCENES3) PLEASE NO HANDHELD CAMERA VIEW4) MAKE THE MOVIE LOCATION IN A POPULAR LOCATION like (Los Angeles, London, ect.)"
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"""What if a monster attacked a city?"" This is the shockingly novel concept behind the viral marketing triumph of the year! Filled with ""fresh""* performances and ""authentic""** cinematography, Cloverfield masterfully takes a page from The Blair Witch Project, reworking the snotty-20-somethings-endure-trauma-while-repeatedly-saying-dude genre into something unique while still being very much the same. Look for star turns by That Girl Who Was in Mean Girls and That One Dude Who Played Eric in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.Mike, Kevin and Bill's RiffTrax was found by the Department of Defense (and then thrown away, but we dug it out of a garbage can.)*Not very good.**Not good at all."
4,"kewl flick, but a bit nauseating","i loved this movie and saw it in the theater as soon as it came out. i think the lost camera thing helped make it very realistic and entertaining. the only part i didn't like was when they were at the party in the beginning and swinging the camera all around madly. it has some crashes, gore, sprinting down manhatten streets covered in glass and rubble in just bare feet. yes, they all die except lily,and people say that's depressing. so what? people die.all in all, a good movie, though maybe not one you'd want to see with little kids or your grandparents."
2,"Been there, done that","Ok, I get it: ""Blair Witch Project"" (with a budget) meets ""War of the Worlds."" Been there, done that. Yeah, the monster (from outer space, I assume) was cool but I kept thinking of the Zerg from Starcraft, which made me laugh. No plot to speak of (see: ""28 Weeks Later"") and I was disappointed by the lack of back-story.Overall: cool special effects but still a predictable and uninspired film.Not recommended."
3,"Popcorn, Excedrin, Dramamine...... needed essentials for watching this movie","I managed to watch this movie only in bits and pieces, as i was having a hard time to focus because of the camera movement and was getting a headache and a bit nauseous.That fact aside, i thought the movie was a reasonably well made monster flick, although i am a bit old fashioned and looking at some of the special effects if they had done the traditional way of filming, it would have been cool."
5,Excellent transaction!,"The shipping was incredibly fast, and the product was brand new, and in perfect shape! Thank you for the great service!"
1,Cloverfield,I didnt like this movie at all . Iwhich i would of seen it before i bought it . It dont make any sense at all. Iwas so dark you could hardly see anything at all. My husband even fell asleep during the movie. It moved so much it got me dizzy. Iwouldnt advise for anybody to purchase this. Iwished i hadnt purchase this It not worth $14.99 . thats what i paid for it.
2,Scarey... but the shaky camera is SUPER ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!,"They made a mistake by using the handheld for the whole thing. It was scarey but I almost walked out near the begining because the begining party scene was too long. It reminded me of being at ground zero on 9-11. The acting was pretty bad too in some cases. Unfortunately the worst was the guy holding the camera- terrible actor. And it would have been deeper if we had a little more information about the creatures. The stupid jocks we're following around are too stupid to think much about it. They stole the running rat scene from 28 Days Later, and let's face it- they stole the whole camera thing from Blair Witch. This could have been a great film with normal cameras."
1,Cloverfield.,"Cloverfield is a terrible movie annoying and liable to make you dizzy thanks to someone's ""bright"" idea of moving the camera around. it's like blair witch yet worst(how that's possible I don't know).the movie is just a rip off of godzilla and plays off end of the world fears.I have seen B-movies ten times better than this."
3,Crazy camera! But shows that less is more!,"Very tightly produced. Bare straight-forward plot. ""Unknown"" type characters (even though we get names and some background). I'm not a fan of gore so I appreciated the fact that except for a scene involving a military medical set-up many extreme occurences were implied rather than shown (thus the PG-13 rating). Less is more sometimes and I hope that more producers recognize that some audiences appreciate that. For fans who want a little more ""show"" and tell, ""The Mist"" (now on DVD) produces tight action and tense background (and some blood and guts). Camera-work in ""Cloverfield"" is really all over the place (which is part of the scenario) but if you can get past that, it opens for a brief entertaining movie."
5,Wonderful!,I liked it in the theater and love it even more in HD!Paramount did a great job on this video release.
2,"Short, annoying shaky cam, but ok monster","This is 9/11 meets Godzilla meets Blair Witch Project meets Alien. The scenes of falling buildings and billowing smoke blowing up Manhattan streets like an avalanche are straight out of 9/11. The filmmakers are up front about their homage to the Japanese Godzilla movies. And the hand-held video cam throughout the entire 75 minute film is Blair Witch, but very annoying after awhile. I thought the little spidery monsters looked like Alien leftovers. There are almost as many extras as there is movie, but you won't care if you don't like the film. I thought it was ok, if a bit thin. The 20 something actors don't show much talent."
3,better than I first thought,"I gave up my first attempt at watching this movie because the camera work is so very, very bad ( deliberately);the end of the world with New York being invaded by a giant alien monsterwhen viewed from a handheld cam -corder by a very bad cameraman.Actually the acting is pretty good and reminds one of theThe Blair Witch Project.I was also reminded of the originalThe War of the Worlds (Modern Library Classics)type of eventthat was remade over and over and got less and less like the original novel."
4,Believe the hype,"Film about giant creatures laying waste to New York, told from the point of view of one character who films it all on his camcorder. Human drama and monster mayhem collide in this genuinely scary production from Lost and Alias creator J. J. Abrams. The monsters in this film will freak you out. They sure did me, and although this film did not quite reach the heights I was expecting this is still a must-see film. Believe the hype."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is by far the most I've ever felt gypped after buying a DVD! The director ought to be horsewhipped! Apparently he decided that the premise was SO idiotic that there was no way he could explain why ANYTHING happens - so he doesn't. We never even have a hint about where the monster comes from, what it is, why it's attacking New York, what it's trying to accomplish.... Oh, yes. And why this movie was ever made. Apparently keeping the viewer in the dark PAST the closing credits is considered ""arty"" by people trying to substitute that for talent.And what can I say about the hand-held camera idea? Its spastic motion all over the place (as opposed to pointing it in the direction of something you'd want the viewer to see...) gave me a splitting headache from eyestrain. Other flicks have managed to use the hand-held technique WITHOUT showing us the floor 70% of the time. (Best-ever hand-held: ""Band of Brothers."")My recommendation: Run away from this, as fast as you can!"
1,The person who film this movie did not know how to film.,"I did not like the way this movie was recorded, I almost could not see anything, the camera was in a constant movement and finally I was tired of all this movement and I turned it off before the end.I was surprised that the movied was produced by Paramout Picture.. I think next time they should select skillful people to record the films."
1,I have watched the worst movie ever.,"Just when I thought anything with Will Smith in it is bad, this junk came along. Where to even begin? It's so bad I skipped through most of it to spare myself of the bad story and horrible acting skills.Save yourself. Stay away from this junk."
1,CLOVERFIELD SUCKS,Cloverfield is not a movie it's a documentary with someone holding a video camra and it's not very good.
1,Absolutely moronic,"What is there to say? Blair Witch goes to Manhattan. Hands down, one of dopiest movies I have ever watched. Thank God it was only 75 minutes. **BnB Beatles Depot**"
2,Is Paramount Worried??,"Yes, I think Paramount is worried. After just watching JJ Abrams ""Cloverfield"", I see why they have delayed the opening of the new Star Trek movie. Wow! What a dissapointment this movie was. I was never hooked into the idea that these people decide to document their evening of terror. If this is a sampling of the new Hollywood wonder boy Paramount might want to consider going back to the drawing board before a real icon is trashed. Where can I go to get my 14 bucks back?"
1,shouldn't even be a movie!!,this movie was horrible i saw it when it was in theaters. And i got the feeling of motion sickness because of the camera always shaking around. you dont really get to enjoy the movie and cant get a handle on the whole story. it was a lot like the blair witch project. i would not recommend this movie to anyone. rent it if you really wanna see it. dont waste your money on this its not even worth the disc its burned on.
1,dont do it,"Do not waste your money!!! This film totally sucked. Read all the other reviews and then read between the lines. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this movie. It might have made an interesting book, but was definitely not cinema worthy! I love a good horror movie and was highly disappointed. Blair Witch was actually better and it sucked too. I used to think BW was the worst to come out of Hollywood...but now its Cloverfield."
2,disappointing at best,"The director does a facile job of creating tension. That's really the only positive I can assign to this movie. Most of our time was spent by a bunch of stereotypically irresponsible twentysomethings partying and then screaming, ""Oh my God,"" ""What was that?"" and ""What's going on?"" We didn't really see anything gelling until, oh, the last fifteen minutes. IMHO, Cloverfield ranks up there with The Blair Witch Project in the ""much ado about nothing"" department."
2,Worse than expected,"Unfortunately, this movie missed the mark more than I had envisioned, even considering the poor reviews. The characters and the decisions they make are fairly unrealistic given the scenario at hand. There are MANY technical mistakes. The ending and key moments leading up to it are extremely predictable (e.g. the story leaves much to be desired). There are a number of ""cheesy horror"" moments that serve no purpose except to be slavish to the genre. At least the camera work was mildly interesting, though.In short, if you want to see a cheesy horror film in the vein of The Blair Witch project, and you don't mind turning off your brain, you might partially enjoy this film. I did not."
2,ever see the Blair Witch story? Here it meets a big monster,"Ugh.I was completely disinterested in the loser characters.The monster is kind of stupid.They all die in the end.But it was watchable, kind of. When I got bored I accelerated it to 1.5 or 5 speed.It's a lot better than a 1 rated move, because those are jokes. This is just over hyped, and not that good."
1,Just awful!,"If I could give this a half star I would. Boring...! And of course, violent. It took too long to get to the point, whatever that was...!"
1,Godzilla was better...,"Cloverfield could have been a box office hit and made million and millions of dollars, but instead of going for the Gold the director went for the ""Artisy fartsy"" look. If you enjoy watching a movie that you never really get a good look at, or if you enjoy a movie that has that Blair Witch meets Godzilla Look to it you'll really LOVE this one. I wish directors would remember to keep it simple and keep it GREAT. This is a Great movie that could have topped the list and not fallen under the bus. Don't waist your money. Geeze...even Godzilla was better!"
1,Aweful!!!,"Bought it instead of renting. Big mistake. It's like the Blair Witch Trials. The camera shakes the whole time, people running and screaming, and you have no clue what is going on. The graphics suck. The story part would have been great if more info was included. Who is going to hold on to a camera the whole time your running from a giant monster? Whether you are 50 feet in the air or being attacked in a dark subway while creatures is attacking you. Not to mention that the camcorder is like the tuffest camcorder of all time and with a super battery LOL. No camcorder is going to withstand that kind of drama and the battery would not last an entire night and next morning. Kind of stupid but just my opinion. Would watch if extremly bored but not worth $16.99 that I paid for it."
1,Do yourself a favor. Save your money. Buy a book. Don't watch this movie.,What a waste of time. The only thing you will get from this movie is a headache. Tell your friends. Tell your family; this movie sucks. The monster is ridiculous and unbelievable. The humans are annoying and I found myself rooting for their demise pretty early on in the movie. And the camera shaking for 80 minutes will leave you with a mild case of dementia.
5,A better Monster Movie. IMO,"So I got my Steelbook Edition. Sure its nothing to be jumping off the walls for. But hey, its a nice metal case, has the movie and what not in it. I guess only negative is that you can get a deluxe ver. @ Target and get Rob's Goin to Japan Party Mix. Or Im sure Walmart had some extra. Every big store had their plus to it. I guess bottom line. If you bought the original version, stick with it. If you want to spend $30-50 more for the Steelbook, (some cases $50-99 now online) then go for it. If youre a fan and collector of monster movies, then get it. Otherwise, stick with the boring ver. Movie suggestion, get some drinks, pop the movie in, and start hitting the drinks when the party gets going."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I watched this only 1 time, and it wasn't worth it. This is the worst movie I had ever seen. I think that someone wanted to make a movie and move the camera everywhere. This movie feels like it is getting you dizzy with all the moving of the camera. I think that whoever made this movie needs to do a better job next time. Don't waste your time and money on this item. You will be disappointed."
1,Home movie sold as Hollywood title...,I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this movie at the theatre. The constantly shaking camera work would have given me motion sickness. The movie would have been semi-OK if they had mixed in some professional production work along with the sickening POV stuff. SPOILER ALERT: At the end of the movie we are no closer to finding out what the monster was or where it came from - very disappointing.
1,Worst movie ever,"THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS.When trying to think of a movie with worse camera work or a more retarded plot, I simply can't do it. This is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. The camera jerks around badly, and if you're subject to motion sickness, you should take something before watching this crapfest. There is no character development, so when people start dying you end up thinking to yourself, ""oh well. Probably had that coming."" And in the end, not only are all the characters dead, but we still don't have any answers like: What happens to the monster? At the end of the movie, he's still eating skyscrapers and beating the snot out of the army.Don't watch this crap; you'll end up wishing that you had your 90 minutes back."
1,I Wish I Had Known,"This movie is filmed ""camcorder"" style by one of the characters, who amazingly keeping filming during all this melee, which means the picture is constantly moving and the more action, the more ""bobbing"" around and upside scenes or pictures of the street. I think it is true to someone running around with a camcorder and I'm sure considered creative. But, I was tired when I rented this and wanted to have something to watch while I relaxed. The jarring photography was a headache to watch, the beginning is slow and confusing and I didn't finish watching the rest."
1,how crappy can it get?,"Cloverfield. New name for Central Park after some weird disaster happens. Not well explained in the film.That said, the actors were lame. Lamer than I've ever seen in any movies - and I've watched a whole lot of them. They were lousier than B-movie actors, if that is possible.The direction... was pathetic. Lousy. The camera was going all over the place, making it impossible to understand or figure out anything.When you do get to see the ""beast"", you can tell it's very (emphasis here!) badly done. Not credible.The dialog between the characters is unbelievably childish. No, let me correct this. Not even children would speak that way. I felt as if the script had been written by morons.To avoid at all cost.(Just because there was a huge promotional campaign about the movie, does not mean it's any good! This movie is just another ""Godzilla in NYC"". Useless.)"
2,A 84 MINUTE COMING ATTRACTIONW,"Watching ""Cloverfield' is like watching a 84 minute coming attraction and once you've finished watching you realize you've been conned,duped and just plain fooled. Filmed by someone with the shakes on a vid cam-the film just ends with Mr Shaky being crushed under a footbridge with the skyscraper tall creature still stomping around New York City and maybe taking a time out to catch a broadway show. And apparently the creature couldn't find a baby-sitter as there are a bunch of nasty baby creatures running around.I smell a sequel coming and hopefully this time they will hire a steadier cameraman but then it will be just another Godzilla movie and Lord knows we could always use another Godzilla movie.The only scene in this film that had any impact was the Statue of Libertys' head careening down the avenue like a bowling ball-and I'm not sure if it was a political statement but that scene was filmed clear and with a steady hand. Hmmmmmm."
2,"wow, this is the worst movie ever!!!!",This is one of those movies that u just cant wait to get up and go away!!!
2,You call that a movie?,"The movie ""Cloverfield"" is good at what it does. Remember all thost great scenes in Alien, for example, where the wreckage and bodies are piling up, the lights are flashing, and there's this great suspenseful moment with The Thing not yet emerged from the shadows? This movie does that scene really well.That's all it does. Really. That's it, front to back, beginning to end, but with bouncy hand-held cameras and yelling. That's all.The end.-- wiredweird"
4,"ACT I OF A TERRIFIC TERRORIST METAPHOR, WE NEED ACT II AND III","I loved this clever, sly little movie that works first as a visceral horror flick (yes, horror).You are there when the unthinkable happens. What do you do? Run like hell!Help your friends.Stay alive.Keep breathing.There's not always a ready answer to things that happen. And often the answer we are given is not the truth.Something evil and horrible is afoot and it is awesome in its destructive power and relentless in its anger.The main thing is to live long enough so you can figure out what's going on and how to respond.It's interesting that in the movie, the official government answer is the ""Hammer Down"" policy that isolates, seals and ""writes off"" Manhattan. And so the terrorists win. Now that's really scary. But that's just Act I.This terrific little monster movie demands a second and third act.I can't wait."
4,Cloverfield Rocks,"For a movie that was supposed to be seen once, the blu-ray was great, picture sound and every thing, I have to admit being able to go back and catch the things i missed in the theater was great! The extras provide more insight to the story. I would definitely recommend this to others of the big monster genre!"
5,Spectacular!,"I became aware of this film through all of it's viral stuff online. I actually had a friend of mine who i happened to be working with at the time, him and i gathered info and spoke about this film for a good month or two before it came out. It was all over the net. It did pretty good actually, very interesting film. I went to see this in Long Beach i remember, early in the morning actually. Great film. A lot of POV shots, a lot of running and a lot of unanswered questions. Pretty much, without giving this film away, it is about a frightened creature. Rising from the depths of the ocean. Reason? Motive? Watch the movie, see what you get..."
5,Cutting edge grandiose horror,Excellent view of the end of Manhattan thru the video eyes of two lovers who are filmed by themselves as this indescribable ghoul rips up everything. Don't miss it on horror-night!
2,Monsterous!!,"As everyone has said, the camera shaking makes this film barely tolerable. There were a couple of times I actually thought that if Hud would quit shaking the camera so much, this might not be a bad movie. The special effects are great, and the acting is not too bad, but I wanted some CLOSURE and gave a low rating because I did not get it. Someone please tell me...What finally happened to the monster?Where did the monster come from...space???What happens to the ""bite victims""??Aside from these main questions I also wondered...Why are those girls continuing to run in high heels?How did the Army get to Manhatten so fast, were they pulled from Iraq???I could go on and on and many of my issues have been addressed in earlier reviews. Let me conclude by warning that if you like movies with well-rounded endings that answer all of your questions, you will be disappointed."
2,Rent Godzilla instead,"While this film has a lot to recommend it, it is a disappointment overall. I liked the idea of a video record of an attack by a monster from the viewpoint of one person's camcorder. The performances in the film are good and the special effects are very well done. However, the overall effect never really gets you involved with the story. The monster is only seen in quick glimpses untill the very end of the film. There is no clear resolution to the film's story, other than you know that there is a military attack on the monster and that the camcorder was found later on. (Spoiler alert) You only know that most of the characters that you are watching die, one in a very gruesome way.The films concept was a good one, I thought, but if you're going to see NYC trashed by a monster, get the remake of Godzilla. It's not a great film, but at least it doesn't take itself too seriously and has some fun to it. This film is a major downer and doesn't really hold together."
3,Fun,"Neat movie. I hated the beginning. It was boring and full of fake, bad acting. My husband said ""keep watching"" and I was glad I did. This turned into a neat thriller"
5,"Cool, exciting and suspenseful","This is a great Sci-Fi DVD. Great special effects and an interesting take on the camera work. It is supposed to be a video documentary of a friend's going away party with a hand held video cam and ends up being a continuous video of event's that take place during and after the party. You get a sense of spontaneity and realism. The ""special features"" show you how they made the movie and special effects. Very Cool!! I highly recommend it."
2,Save your money,Have this DVD in Blu-ray format sorry but the flim was a dud would rate it 2 stars at best rent it from Blockbusters/Netflix would not recommend buying it (as I did)
4,Guilty Pleasure & it's Multi-Regional,"I was initially put off by this film, as the critics compared it to Blair Witch, which I hated. Anyhow when it appeared on DVD / Blu-Ray I read further reviews stating ""If you enjoy films such as Godzilla, then you'll love this"". Having recently purchased a PS3 I bought this on Blu-Ray American, as it isn't yet available in the UK.I loved every minute of it, if anything I just wish it was longer. Some people didn't like the Shaky cam effect, but this didn't bother me at all, if anything I was even more absorbed by the film. Great film that definately required repeat viewings."
5,Great movie,This is a new updated Godzilla kind of movie. The special effects were awesome! The monsters were really cool too.
1,Cloverfield,Cloverfield wasn't at all what I thought it would be I guess I am not into documentaries cause I didn't care for Blair Witch project either and this is what Cloverfield reminded me of
1,"Cloverfield sucks, I mean shakes!","I don't have anything very eloquent to say about this movie, and that's OK I suppose, because the movie isn't eloquent either. I hated this movie! I hated the far-fetched stupid story and I hated the shaking camera. It's a glorified Blair Witch Project, at best. And that's not saying anything good, in my opinion. I couldn't get invested in the story. I watched the whole thing, but at the end, I had no idea what any of the character names were and I couldn't have cared less. This movie was a real waste of my time."
1,Stupidfield,This movie looks like it was made by a bunch of three year old's running around with a vido camera. The movie makers must have been on some heavy duty drugs.
1,This film is a waste of your time,"If you have half a brain don't bother with this movie. It's technically well-done, but ultimately, it's trash. I feel cheated."
1,Worst Movie Ever made,"Perhaps the most boring beginning of any film ever made. It took fifteen minutes before something mildly intersting happened. I disliked all of the major characters, and since there is no story line per se, without characterization there is nothing left but some not-very well-done Special Effects.Basically, this is the sort of movie that a film student makes in their second year as an experiment. Then when all of their classmates, and professors, laugh at it, they learn to start telling an interesting story, and move on, wiser and more mature.Cloverfield offers the viewer nothing at all."
1,Pathetic,"This is the worst movie I have ever watched. I can't even view it to the end. The jittery camera view, the constant screaming overriding the dialog, I sat there and prayed that the cameraman would die. Then I pray that the rest would to and put me out o9f my misery. Finally I just turned it off."
3,"ask your self, host or cloverfield..?","i saw it in the theater and i don't think the story warrants for multiple viewings, the effects of the monster in the camera was good and the parasites were a riot, but you never get a good look at the monster , let alone a full view of it.. all i can say is it has the same anatomy as the monster in ""the host"",,walks on 2 front legs, long tail, breathing lungs on side of face, , too many similarities,,,this movie is not about the monster it is about some guy willing to risk all of his friends to look for some girl he forgot to tell he loved....you saw the box office receipts fall very quickly, the movie is worth renting..."
4,It's CLEVER FIELD. The best monster movie of 2008 so far,"It's suspenseful. It kept my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end. The special effects of the monster are spectacular. Yes, the filming technique that uses hand-held camera did cause me a little discomfort to watch in some scenes. However it's also makes this film stands out from others in the same genre.If you want something different, suspenseful and highly entertaining, this is for you. It's certainly worth watching."
1,Rob is soooo annoying,How annoying is he? By the time they got out of the tunnel I was rooting for the monster.
1,I need an aspirin!,What a waste of time and money! I made it through about 10 minutes before I got a headache and had to lay down. Paramount should rot for making a terrible film. Unless you like home movies and a jumpy screen. I'd rather pill out and walk in traffic than sit through this again. What torture!
1,Stupid handheld filming,"I would give this movie 0 if i can, but i give it 1 for special effect effort. I cannot keep up with the movie because i have to look away everytime the movie shaking. It's really really annoying. This has spoiled entire movie... So summarize what i HATE about this movie:- I dont know if movie makers ever think of putting themselve into a dangerous situation but still filming.- A movie without content except the city was attacked by monster and people were running around seeking places to hide- Main characters are idiot folks- Special effect, well, is far worse than Gorilla- Movie is too shortSo recommendation:- If you just want a movie about monster, maybe it's for you.- If you want to get dizzy and vommit on your popcorn, hola, you get one."
2,Cloverfield--a disappontment,"From the previews I expected an ""Independance Day"" type movie. Turns out it is supposed to be some kind of home video of a questionably alien invasion. It drags at the beginning and seems pretty sophmoric for the most part. Think ""The Blair Witch Project"" meets ""Godzilla"". There are some good action sequences but for the most part too many questions and plot twists were left hanging. Wasn't worth the money, in my humble opinion."
1,i will never get...................,............the 74 minutes of my life back. not only i'm still dizzy but they couldn't think of anything better. that was the worse movie ever.
1,Rubbish!!!,"This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, a miserable plot and a ending that is a joke. Dont even waste your time on this filth trash of a movie."
1,Get the aspirins out!,"Cloverfield is no doubt the worst movie I've seen in years. It may appeal to teenagers, but it was total garbage...a total waste of time. Anyone who can enjoy someone running all over the place with a video camera on his head without getting a splitting headache...well, kudos to you. Just envision someone shaking a video camera the whole duration of the movie...that's Cloverfield. I wouldn't even give it one star."
2,Motion Sickness,"This movie gave me motion sickness and I had to stop half-way through. Story was not so interesting. Good looking girls, neat monster. 'Nough said."
2,"Rent, don't buy...","Pros: I loved seeing a fresh young cast of relatively unknown actors instead of over-exposed, overplayed 'A or B-listers'. Kudos on the casting.Cons: everything elseOther thoughts: If you think of this movie as 'Godzilla meets the Blair Witch Project', you'll have a fair idea of what to expect. Oh, and everyone dies. The end."
1,Can this be really called a movie? Really?,"If looking at a bunch of cretins running around with a hand held camera is your idea of entertainment, you found your movie. What a joke."
1,YUCK!!!!!!!,"This movie clearly sucked! So to save everyone the pain of reviewing the whole thing, I think I'll just sum it up.A. I didn't know what was going on in the film.B. The monster needed more screentime then the actors themselves.C. I don't have any idea who the actors were.D. It was Blair Witch Project gone completely bad!E. All it showed was someone holding a video camera videotapping everything and the monster was never ever destroyed! Which is actually a good thing because most of the characters needed to go anyways.To make a long story short, just don't buy this movie for the love of God! This one is really bad!"
1,There are people who will actually buy this movie???,"I took my boys to see this at the theater.All I can say (nicely) is that it was the BIGGEST WASTE of 90 minutes we've ever spent at the movies.I tried to get our money back, but since we watched the entire movie (we kept thinking this HAS to get better) I was SOL.They should pay people to take this movie off their hands!!!"
1,Total Waste of Time and Money!,"After watching this on DVD. You can't believe that you have just wasted hours of your time on something so dumb!.....that guy that was supposedly filming this the whole time, got attacked by monsters, jumped high building voids, etc. etc. and STILL held on to the camera, but he got Eaten in the end (which was one of the only rewarding parts of the entire flick, LOL).So unbelievable!!Ratings:Plot: D-Action: CActing: CWatching without getting irritated: Impossible.Don't waste your time with this one. Save the money, and wait for Iron-Man to come out on DVD."
3,Ok Amusement Ride,"Well, ""The Descent"" or ""The Host"" is not. This movie doesn't rewrite the monster-movie flick but the amusement-ride-film. By now yo know what it is about: what if the next alien-monster-disaster destroying New York was filmed by a bystander for us to see? Nice initial idea, but not enough thinking about what to do next. Why not go to the extreme and use the videos other people made that day? Alternating between them? Some bystanders filming others? A journalist with his cameraman so as to get somebody with a motivation to get close to the monster? (a cliche, but a logical way to do it).Well, I didn't like them stealing from ""The Descent"" (night-vision moment in the subway), but it was worth my 3 US dollars (cinemas in Argentina are cheap if you go at the matinee)."
1,Written and Filmed by Teens,"This film is rediculously amaturish. I know it is supposed to look that way, but realy once the party is over, apparently there are only five people in all of Manhatten. Most of the dialogue is screaming, OMG! The Army had an almost immediate response to the event. They seem to have arrived en mass about five minutes after the scary spidery thing appears. Shades of 9/11 with buildings crashing down. It seems you can have an injury serious enough to bleed to death, but once extracated you can run several city blocks. This wasn't bad film-making it was the worst movie I may ever have seen in my 61 years! Too much unbelievable feats, too much reliance on main characters (apparently after these five can not escape the city, they are all alone--we know now how fast and efficiently you can evacuate NYC); why bother paying for extras to make it more realistic? Bad, bad, theatrics. Bad acting. Poor dialogue. Thematically as old as Godzilla. Don't waste time or money on this film"
5,Great movie,I bought this for my husband. He said the movie is of good quality. He apparently had seen the movie on a bootleg version. Said this is 100% better.
3,Good special effects; overall a silly movie,"I remeber seeing previews of this movie at the theater. I am really glad I waited for the DVD instead of paying the price of a ticket. I had great hopes, but the hand-held documentery style filming was awful. The camera was all over the place and in fact made me quite dizzy at times. The documentary angle is way over done. The acting is horrible with a bunch of yuppies wandering through Manhattan amid its total destruction by an unidentified monster. A worn out plot, relatively unknown actors and ludicrous situations make it difficult to watch with enjoyment. I gave it three stars just for the brief but very good special effects."
3,"Good, But","This was a good movie that suffered from an annoying camera and a non-ending. It is dysfunctional - you will love it and hate it at the same time.Why, why, why! couldn't you just have dropped the darn Blair Witch deal and made it without shaky cam?This movie is NOT for those with motion sickness. And don't expect any explanations."
3,Perhaps the best horror/action/sci-fi movie...,"...I couldn't watch.The realism...amazing! The effects...outstanding! The story line..intriguing. The acting...strong.The camera work... nauseating!!!! Oy!The camera shake was so continuously disorientating that I began feeling nauseous, and that feeling just got worse and worse as time went on.What's frustrating is that I WANTED to watch the movie because it is so riveting, but my equilibrium simply wouldn't let me."
5,One of my favorite films of all time.,this blu-ray release looks amazing and is a superb update to the standard def disc. i remember seeing this film with a large group of friends which was amazing on the big screen and we talked about it frequently for several weeks after. i ended up seeing it twice in the theater and 3 or 4 times so far on disc. this movie may not be for everyone but imo it's a true classic masterpiece.
5,Fantastic!,"A story of 5 New Yorkers who arranged a go-away party for their friend Jason whose travelling to Japan, only to discover later that night that their city is under attack by a huge monster whose truly unstoppable. Throughout the movie they run for their lives and they film it all on tape. So you see this movie from the perspective of a hand camera and you really live their horrific experiences.Superb film, its like a good mix of Independence Day, War of the Worlds, Blair Witch Project, and Godzilla."
4,"Good movie, but didn't like the amateur camcorder style","I liked the movie, but I didn't like the camcorder-style video. I know this was done on purpose as an I-reporter's point of view, but the larger the screen, the worse the motion sickness.I can't imagine what it would have been like to be watching on a 80-ft wide screen. All I know is, when I watched the movie on my smaller 24-inch tv, I had no problems, being that everything around the TV was motionless with the exception of the video. When I played the DVD on my computer, sitting closer to the screen, the motion-sickness got more apparent. I would advise those with a wide-screen HDTV to rent this movie first before buying it.Overall, good story; I enjoyed the movie. I just won't play the movie on my computer, that's all :)"
2,Cloverfield is HORRIBLE,"I still am not sure how we sat through this movie. I guess we kept hoping it would get better. The entire premise of someone continually video taping anything while everyone around them is being killed is idiotic. The movie could have been pretty good had it not been filmed through the ""eyes"" of a video camera. Don't waste your time or money buying this junk."
4,Not that bad!,I really enjoyed CLOVERFIELD! Not the best monster smash-up out there. A fun grab your popcorn and check your head at the door type of flick!
1,Spend your money on Godzilla instead,"Saw this movie for the first time the other night. The trailer is incredibly misleading in that it leads you to believe this will be an action packed movie.The only good thing this movie had going for it were the special effects. The action shots were few and far between, and it dragged on in places, especially throughout the first hour. I felt like I was watching the Ferris Bueller remake of Godzilla from the standpoint of the people being squashed in the street.If I had seen this in the theater, I would have walked out. The largest complaint I have read about this movie is the shaky hand-held camera movements. I didn't have a problem with that. What really bothered me was the lack of anything happening."
1,Worst Movie on Record,"I can't believe this movie has got even one good review. The filming of the movie was terrible. The movie was dark the special effects were terrible. I couldn't wait for this movie to end. The acting was terrible and I found myself cheering for the monster. It would be niced if the movie had a plot and was based on some sound principles. This movie wouldn't have even made a good ""B"" movie. Hollywood needs to produce a lot better product. Thank goodness for RedBox because I only wasted a dollar. I would have been upset if I would have spend $20 for this pathetic movie."
3,"Cool story, images really need to be stable","This was a really good story, excellent monster, cool little monsters. Exploding people. All in all a good story.Bad part of the movie was the filming. Even the cheesiest, low budget cameras have stabilization now. Use it, learn it, live it."
1,Only an IDIOT would by this on BLUE-Ray,"This was one STUPID movie, I have a 19.99(21.66 with tax)BlockBuster membership with Unlimited DVD's with 5 in-store exchanges. I have only been watching Blue-Ray movies (to get my money's worth)so far. Cloverfield was a waste of my families viewing time - we could not believe the stupid creature and the endings (there were 3 of them).I now plan on reading all the the Amazon Blue-Ray reviews, BEFORE I rent any more movies.As soon as BlockBuster deposits $30 in my paypal account(that was there promo for signing up), I plan on canceling.I give Cloverfield 0 stars ( I wonder if this movie really made by superman's (chris Reeves) son (Matt Reeve)?Update as of Today October 14, 2009 - Blockbuster has not put that $30 in my paypal account - so what I did (in August) was request 3(three) of the very best Bluerays, and I did not look back(no intention of returning them). There is a rumor going around that BlockBuster Video they may be going bankrupt soon anyway."
1,Blah...,"This movie is sometimes really annoying. If the creature was easily identified(i.e. Godzilla), this movie would have rocked!!! Sadly, it's some reject from a really bad B-movie. Damn!!! So much potential thrown away...."
1,Waste of money,"You'd be better off taking your money outside and giving it to a homeless person. I don't know who's idea it is to create a movie of a crappy filmed movie, but I'll not ever, repeat, EVER rent another one like it. This movie is of the same quality as Blair Witch Project. It sucked."
1,Here we go again.. the double dipping continues.....,"Unless I am totally missing it, this is going to be another bare bones 1 disk craptacular release. I assume by late summer or Christmas we will get the ""REAL"" release of this movie with a multiple disk version with tons of extras.I have lost track of the number of movies I have had to re-buy because the delayed better version is always out later... Zodiac and Sin City are two recent ones that come to mind.RARE is the sign that the movie studios actually care about our buying choices... like American Gangster and Master and Commander have had basic one disk versions out on the same day as the multiple disk deluxe versions.Oh well..."
1,bad filming,well i have enough of the movies of the kind of blair witch : bad filmingi wanted to end when i watched cloverfield because bad filming while all the entire movie it is too muchanyway i could like it if it was not a camescope filming
1,Really Bad,"After 100 years of movie making, I didn't think it was possible for Hollywood to make a really bad movie. I was wrong. I was so thankful when it was finally over. If they were attempting to be artistic with this movie, they failed miserably."
1,Worst monster movie ever,"Worst monster movie ever. Viewing a 300 foot monster through a straw is not the right presentation. The beginning of the movie was long, winded and boring; I started to yawn after 10 minutes. The photography was literally nauseating and I could not wait until the camera was smashed by the monster. The producers try to makes us think that the Queasy-cam format is brilliant and refreshing; nonsense! They probably did not have enough money to produce this movie so they hide their ill conceived ideas behind artistic license. The producers should watch some Godzilla movies and learn how the masters do it."
2,Too Bad,What a shame. Great story. Good acting. Lousy camera work! The CONSTANT shaky camera with no let up makes for a NOT AS MUCH FUN AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN experience. Too bad.
2,Typical teen blood and gore movie,"If you enjoyed The Blair Witch Project, you will enjoy this movie. The camera movement was annoying, and script quite shallow. My wife amd I lost it when first hearing the spider like critters make their sounds. I must admit that it was a humorous way to waste an hour+ of my life............."
1,Unbelievably Awful,I watched Cloverfield - (the movie) on cable TV the other night. In my 59 yrs on this planet I cannot remember seeing a worse film. Young thin aimless adolescents with no lives running around with a tiny unsteady video camera. Never mind - it's just awful.
2,Disappointing,"Nothing much to add to the numerous existing negative reviews here. I knew what this movie was before I bought it. Wanted to like it, but found it wholly unsatisfying. Do NOT waste your time."
4,Cloverfield is a sci-fi must see,"This movie, Cloverfield, deserves every star it gets. Its one of those movies that you can watch a million times and it would still be excellent. It has a twisting, horrific, exciting plotline. The entire concept of Cloverfield seems completely real besides the fact that Manhattan is still standing. The producers have done a fantastic job of making this movie seem real. It is all shot on a hand-held camera, with shakeycamera work and no music giving the feeling that your really watching a tape someone picked up in central park. The producers have also added some interactive real life add ons for some die hard fans. 4 stars, all earned perfectly."
1,bummed,"this would have been a great movie if it wasn't for the factn the jack asses that made it, wasn't doing it through a cam corder..the whole entire movie is recorded with a hand held, which absolutely pulls you away from the entertainment..if they broke the movie up , atleast it would have been more tolerable..to see the whole thing done with a hand held just ruined the whole experience of the show.."
5,"Great, would love more","excellently performed and executed, the movie rings home for people who live in the NYC area who would be familiar with the areas that are shown in the movie (downtown, midtown, etc). My only discomfort is that it left me with too many questions, but I don't see this as a bad thing. Great out-of-the-box thinking from JJ Abrams on this one."
2,The camera guy,"my reviews is always short cuz i dont want it to be boring while reading it and cuz of my poor English.first of all this movie would be a lot better if it is just viewed or let me say if we watch it just likethe other movies .. the standard camera p; .. not the camera guy :) .. so u can not see it clearu miss something some times cuz of this Camera .sounds are great in this movie ,, thanks for reading."
1,A Very Stupid Movie,"Has no plot, lousy acting, special effects are o.k., however nothing to write home about.If you order this movie, they should send it to you free, and pay YOU $100 for taking it off their hands."
1,"Good idea, bad camera","The whole idea of having a point of view from a small group sounds very interesting, indeed. However, the way they conduct their ""amateur"" camera seems worst than any 3-year-old child holding a camera. I think it's a wrong mistake that an amateur camera could mean something like that. At end, I could see only 3 or 5 minutes of this film. The result is awful."
1,This disk is now residing in the corn field next door,Thank god for the fast forward button. If I wanted a hand held camera movie about terror I'd film my ex-wives. The few good parts of this movie could be condensed into a 3 minute short.
1,Waste,"I didn't buy this dvd, but saw the movie on cable.It's just about a couple of young adults (one with a video camera) running around NYC while some monster is destroying the city.It ends with their death.Not much more plot than that.Don't waste your time or money on buying this DVD."
2,steel grip hud,"the camera must have been welded to that guys hand.only in a movie would a guy walk thru a war zone tackle monsters big and small to get to his .... what!!!!!!! friggen girl friend !!!!????? what a dope.hud in one point in the movie says if this is the last thing you see then it means i died, die hud die."
2,ok movie,"I will say I was entertained, the party scene was real dumb and some of the smaller monsters were ultra wimps. I took off for the very unpleasant camera work, I understood the concept of it, but it wasn't fun to watch that bumpy style. They surely could've made it longer to go into some explanation of the who, what, where, why, that was left unresolved. If there is a sequel I'll probably pass."
2,Boredom and Battles,"I knew a hand-held camera was used for this film, but I still was not prepared for the jerky, off-center camera work. Getting old. For me, it was impossible to get to know or care about those involved. The party wasconfusion; with too much noise to understand most of the dialogue. Once the creature(s) showed up, though, it did get better.The mobilization of Army/Airforce units, seemed very quick but the actual combats scenes seemed authentic. (Maybe the chaos started a lot sooner than we know). The creature was just strange enough, to be unique. It seemed as frightened as the people.(No idea where it came from). As you can tell, I didn't really care what happened to people. And I was hoping for the crusading scientist, to give us some Creature Biology lessons.Can't have everything!"
1,Disaster.,"I'm writing this review right after I have finished watching it, and I can only say that I have no word to describe the movie but disaster. It's very boring but the speacial effects are good though.The movie is about an attack of some monsters in Manhattan and there is a guy that records with his camera the whole thing. I know that there are several movies like this and they really called my attention at the time I saw them (even when I'm not a fan of science fiction movies) I liked them.The cover really says something completely different of what the movie is. Another thing that I must say about the movie is that it desesperates a little bit because the image is not steady, it is always shaking and you can't see the scenes very good.If you are a disaster movie fan maybe you can like this one but if you're not I doubt you are going to like it."
1,Disappointed...,I found this movie incredibly boring. The actors were pretty bad and the whole thing was just completely unbelievable. The only good parts of the movie were the few laughs I got from the guy who was supposedly filming the whole thing making nerdy comments.
1,the worst,"absolutely not worth one dollar, worst movie I have ever seen, no plot, no answers to any questions that were brought up in the film, the camera shaking all the time does not give a clear picture and makes one nauseaus,in a word the movie sucks!"
4,satisfying,"You know why I liked this movie?It starts out in New York City. A bunch of spoiled rich kids are having relationship problems. After about five minutes, you weary of their woes and begin to wish something, anything, would happen to shatter their idiotic lives. Heck, wouldn't it be hilarious if right then a monster appeared and began to eat the whole lot of them?Right at that point a monster appears and begins to eat the whole lot of them!"
2,At least the monster looks cool!,"This movie at least has a decent monster. I just wish it would have been less Blare Witch. I got tired of the camera always not showing stuff and jumping from one time stamp to another and always bouncing around like a home movie. This movie does not even end in a concluding way. You do not know who lives or dies. You do not know if the monster lives or dies. I give it a two star rating only because of the alien's quality monster. It is cool and the Blu Ray has a sharp picture. Rent his movie or borrow if from some sucker like myself who bought it thinking the director of Lost would not let a movie this bad passes his desk. Oh well, guess we all make mistakes. Buying this movie was one of mine!"
4,This is a FPS movie,"If you are a gamer you probably have played a FPS (first person shooter) where all you see is what your character sees, and that is how cloverfield is shot,through the eyes of these people running away from the monster, it is a great thrill to see it through their eyes and i hope more movies are shot like this in the future. The only problem i had with it though were the first 20 minutes, too much talking.I recomend this movie"
4,"Good, but annoying at times","I've always been intrigued by the alien invasion type films, and the amount of hype for this movie definitely got to me. I am not usually a fan of erratic camera movies, but this one was done pretty well, although before the movie was halfway over Hud really, really got annoying. Not only did the fact he kept turning around to film things seem impossible, especially as shots were being fired or buildings were collapsing, but even his voice got to be irritating. I mean, honestly, if you were being attacked by strange alien beings would you keep recording? Previous reviewers have pointed out whether people would actually follow someone into the center of alien-like activity rather than in the other direction, which is a good point. But although there are some impossible moments, Cloverfield still succeeds due to its uniqueness in the genre."
4,Different type of monster movie,"When ""Cloverfield"" first started, I was thinking, ""What the heck is this?"". People at a party being videotaped by this one dude, the camera jiggling. I was ready to give up on the movie. THEN, the monster attacks. The movie picked up from there. I actually grew to like the first person view through the eye of the dude with the camera.Good stuff!! Kept me wondering what would happen next."
3,Ingenious and frustrating.,"The story is simple, silly even, but the stuff that comes together to make this film is truly ingenious. Yes its hard to watch, for various reasons, and its not necessarily uplifting and it may loose your interest along the way...and its mainly for monster movie fans...BUT...the creative efforts do pay off in the form of exciting and innovative film making. The extras that come with the DVD are great and explain how the film makers took the best advantage of their resources including the secrecy during the film making process and how they produced excellent realistic visual effects. This shows how well visual effects can be blended with the story telling, despite the sparse story. See it if you're a monster fan or visual effects geek."
4,Captured confusion of an urban disaster,"I rated the movie 4 stars because it avoided horror movie cliches in favor of random mayhem.Having a big monster tramping through a city must be pretty confusing. Where do you go? What are those little monster-thingies falling off him? What happens if you get scratched/bitten by one? How big a pack of jerks are the authorities going to be?All that came across in the movie. Not great art, but not crud either."
3,Trying to remember?,"If you or someone you love have ever:Forgotten where you put your keys, your bank's name.Misplaced a thought in the middle of a sentence.Lost a word that was on the tip of your tongue.Drawn a blank on your best friend's name.Wondered if something you were eating or any of the drugs you were taking might affect the way your remember--then this basic book will help you identify some of the causes."
4,SDS-MAX ADAPTER,WORKED WELL AS AN ADAPTER TO OTHER CHISELS NEEDED. IT DID BREAK AFTER TWO DAYS WORK CHIPPING AWAY FLOOR TILES. I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE.
2,3508MT 24-Inch x 32-Inch x 1-3/16-Inch Router Table Top,"The table top was recieved with a separation in the core MDF(?) material which is the main ""strength material"" between the top and bottom Laminate. The separation or crack was plainly visible in the area routed out for the router base plate. I saw the flaw instantly when I opened the package. How could Tommy R. (the inspected by person) have missed this? Anyway after getting over my initial disgust and not wanting the return hassel, I glued and clamped the flaw myself.Also the product I ordered did not have a miter gauge track embedding in the top. The one I received has one. I really wanted the one I ordered without the miter gauge track."
2,Mediocre,"Precisely what we do not have is a real understanding of Sudan. We get a brief history; we get a sense that Petterson's diplomatic endeavours were futile; and we get information about the civil war which is available elsewhere. The fact is, Petterson did not have enough to write a book and should have spared us. If all the good elements were compressed, they would make a chapter in a real book. And the information on terrorism does not add anything new, if you are familiar with al-Qaeda. That was a ploy to encourage people post 11/September to buy it. I read it through, and was not rewarded by understanding Sudan. I will search elsewhere."
5,This is a FABULOUS cd,"I have been a fan of Don Shirley since his first records came out eons ago and had given up finding his music after my LP's were lost. His piano style is unlike any other and if you love a soft but powerful jazz piano, this is the best. Please let's see more of him for those of us who have been looking so long."
5,unique yet universal,"What strikes me as interesting is the universal chord Don Shirley's music has struck among his fans. Once you've heard him, there's no going back and there's no one like him. I was introduced to his music in the mid-60s, bought most of the ""black(Cadence)"" albums, memorized them. Then lost use of the player. A friend painstakingly taped all of them for me, then he discovered the ""Golden Classics"" CD which I bought for myself, another friend who'd met Shirley, and my father. I was priviliged to hear Shirley and the Trio in person in the mid-70s; my second best birthday gift. The thought that more CDs could be released is sheer heaven. I don't use this term lightly, but Don Shirley is as close to genius as it comes."
5,"Don Shirley, ""Instrumentalist Extraordinare""","This CD has 18 cuts from Don Shirley & The Don Shirley Trio on it. I wish it had two discs so it could have another 18 cuts. From the first time I ever heard ""Water Boy"" in the early 60's I have been hooked, Don (piano and arrangements, Ken Fricker, bass fiddle & drums and Juri Taht, cello, have had me in their corner.If you like piano, pop, jazz or just instrumental aural magic, this CD is a rare treat (like a no-cal cheesecake). Enjoy, Bruce"
5,Groovy arabian beats,"I love the vocals in this album, and the drum beats in some of the songs are just heavenly. Banco De Gaia's #2 track is my favorite, but there are a number of other songs in this album that I never tire of. Play this in your party, and the dance floor will soon get crowded ..."
4,Quite Good,"Lets face it, most ""various artist"" albums are pretty poor. This one is actually quite good -with perhaps 75% of the songs being ones that you would want to listen to again and again. In most cases, successful Arabic/Western fusion and dance music.It seems there are more and more talented Arab artists who are becoming attuned to both musical styles sufficiently to make this type of music perhaps the ""next big thing""."
3,New Wave of Arabian sounds,"My latest acquisition ....actually Khamterie (Fifth Sun) gets 5 stars but the rest are pretty heavy going ..techno fusion trance. Good driving beat . Definitely from the ""World Music"" category. I've decided that I like it after all.I think this is the sort of music you might use for a function....not as candyfloss popular stuff.... but to set a certain Modern Progressive kinda mood .... more Trance-y but with a rhythmic bite."
2,disappointing,"I guess it depends what you're into, but I was expecting 'real' Arabic music, and was disappointed with the majority of this album. Tracks 1, 5, 7 and 9 contain enough middle eastern flavour to enjoy, but the rest of the tracks are repetitious techno beat music which I imagine could only be appreciated on a dance floor while whacked out on ecstasy (not that there's anything wrong with that). The two stars are for Fifth Sun (track 1) and Acid Queen (track 9)."
5,Handyhandset,We have three of these phones. They feel nice in your hand and work for years. We actually ordered this one from the used category because it's out of production and we wanted another identical handset.
5,A phenomenal book!,"What a treasure this book is! It's full of fun facts, funny stories and awesome pictures and illustrations that bring Ben Franklin and his era to life in an engaging and entertaining way. The author has done an amazing job collecting quotes, stories and historial context and presenting them in an easily edible format. This is the kind of book that will make kids love history--it would be great addition to every family's bookshelf!"
3,Good,It was my first purchase online with Amazone.I received my book on time and it was in fairly good condition.No complain.Just what I expected.Will order again.
2,not so bangin...,"these drums were absolutely HORRIBLE. no directions whatsoever and they come completely unassembled. they come with the parts needed, yes. but without ample instructions they are worthless. the toms and bass sound totally ridiculous. the snair isnt all THAT bad, but the high hat and the bass pedal are both horrible as well. i bought these drums becuase i just picked up a new double bass pedal and needed to practice while away from my real drum set at my other home..so this set will work for what i need it for. but i wont be reccomending it."
3,It did what it could,"The authors of this tribebook did what they could for this tribebook. However, the tribe by its nature limited what could be done for the book. The history of the tribe is limited, and the archetypes are uninspiring. It does a good job relating what it is like to be a lupus, but that's its only real credit, asides from the typical ""crunchy bits""."
5,Really good read,"This was a really terrific read. The anecdotes about players, coaches, recruiters, officials, and sports reporters are all interesting and some really funny. It's a pretty big book but it reads very fast. The politics of college basketball, from race conflicts, to academics, to the often nasty seduction of recruits, opened my eyes in a big way to these issues that usually get only brief treatment from the media. The coaches that the author followed are pretty stunning characters. I had no idea of the extent of their day-to-day obligations, or their perks. I strongly recommend this book for anybody with even a causual interest in sports. What'll stick with me most for a long time are incredible individual and group moments of pain, and victory, and laugh-out-loud humor. Definitely a good book."
3,"Really, two books in one","I must be getting old...all the guys who were playing basketball when I was in college are now coaches! I was a college classmate of one of the coaches profiled in this book, so from that perspective I found it interesting, but not terribly well-written. This is really two books in one. First, Curtis profiles the ""inside stories"" of the coaches and teams at Iowa, Illinois, Notre Dame, and UCLA. But then, he drops in all sorts of little essays on the state of the college game today: how recruiting works, how coaches really make all their money, how influential Dick Vitale is, how the coaches network among themselves to recommend each other for jobs. Each of these could have been a decent book; both together is just a little too much. There also were a number of spelling errors and a few factual errors."
3,great information -- uninspiring tale,"Some very interesting material told in mundane & uninspiring fashion. Either he had his facts wrong or there was sloppy editting on some occasions. Some of the sidebar explanations of refereeing and recruiting covered ground that has been covered by a variety of authors in much better fashion. We learned about the four coaches, but there was never a real emotional attachment for the most part. College hoops junkies will like it, but as another reviewer mentioned, I would definitely recommend John Feinstein's a ""Season Inside"", ""A March to Madness"" and ""The Last Amateurs"". Perhaps the first for insight into Alford, but I would recommend the last two the most . Especially in ""The Last Amateurs"" I believe that a reader will gain much more emotional attachment to the players & coaches.If this book caused a reader to break up with a girlfriend... the girlfriend may be better off!"
3,its ok,"its ok for most little kids it has grim and evil kinda funny but some parents may not want this. it has some stupid stuff like "" you can pick your friends. and you can pick your nose. but you cant pick your friends nose"" so its funny for little kids about 7 (or 8) and up but there are only 4 cartoons which means about 45 or 50 min so long enough to be a little car ride but not a 2 day trip"
4,great game,"This is not really a game, but a video. I was very surprised with the great picture quality. Sometimes after watching it over and over again, it gets somewhat boring. But I like to trade around with my friends. It has been droped many times and I must say what a durable cartrige this is. Even though it may get a little tiring, it is still very fun to have to watch on either a plane/car ride or just sitting or waiting for the bus."
2,Too many errors.,"This book is comprehensive, BUT ...There are 10 errata pages in the front with 121 entries, mostly in formulas. I don't dare read it until I mark all the erratas in each chapter. With that many errors, they should have corrected the edition before printing."
5,Nice vest!,I am very happy with my new life vest. It is comfortable and well made and it fits me perfect. Nice zipper and buckles in the front. And the two zipper pockets in the front open and close easily and are roomy. Very nice life vest for the price.
4,West Coast Sounds At Their Best,"This was one of the earliest LP's that I bought low those many years ago when I firts began to collect jazz. When I saw it in CD formatt, I jumped to buy it. Previn, as usual is suburb. Leroy Vinneger enhances the group's sound with a solid base line: he is unabtrusively always back there. The bottom line, however, is Shelly. What a supurb drummer! Listen to how he drives the group through the songs of this great Broadway show. As an old drummer I swear that I can hear him ""play"" some of the melody on his instrument. Add this one to your collection."
4,Great flavor,This is a great creamy chai flavor. Its hard to find a good tasting caffeine free tea and this fits the bill.
1,JELLY BEANS ??,"THIS CD MAY HAVE AT LEAST ONE OF THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS SINGING, BUT THESE ARE REMAKES OF THE ORIGINAL HITS AND ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL JELLY BEANS RECORDINGS AND DO NOT SOUND LIKE THE WAY THEY SUNG THEM BACK IN THE 60'S. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MEMORY LANE ENTHUSIASTS !!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.."
2,The Complete Tarot Reader,"If you're new to Tarot or looking for basic card interpretations, don't buy this book! It may not be appropriate for newbies to Tarot. It addresses the author's ""intuitive"" approach to reading the cards, but on page one, the author clearly states, ""There are three ways to learn the Tarot...(1) tradition meanings of the cards, (2) the intuitive approach, and (3) underlying structures and patterns."" The author goes on to say there are plenty of books to teach the first way so there's no point in repeating that in this book.Well, I'm new to Tarot and I expect to find traditional meanings explained, in addition to whatever other approach the author could relate. I was disappointed not being able to find basic card interpretations. Now I have to find another book that teaches those.Of course, if you're an advanced Tarot reader and already are very familiar with basic card interpretations, maybe this book is for you."
5,Out of sight,"This Alblum was a cross over from R&B to Swing Jazz.It is good to listen to ,or getting up on the dance floor and boogieing .It brought back memories for me of when I lived in Chicago during the 60's and was hanging out in Old Town."
5,Quick tips for trade show success,"This is the ticket when you need to quickly get your trade show booth staff up to speed, and they don't have the time to read a book, take a class, or listen to an audio tape. Simple and pragmatic tactics delivered in a paragraph. And at this price, you can buy one for each of your booth staff."
4,wendav,Directions are hard to follow due to picture diagrams not being very detailed. 3/8 holes were in short rails as indicated by directions and this attached top of table to legs with four screws. Arm that came with table is simple and easy to install into the table top. I also purchased router lift from Rousseau for a Makita 2 1/4HP for this table which fit perfectly. This is a great basic table for routing and very stable once completed. Love the table.
2,"Primative, at best",Drawing is next to impossible and the game animation and music are like an old Atari. Don't buy it if you're easily frustrated by non-responsive stylus pads.
1,awesome time,"I agree: if you are looking for a polished, quality engineered game, this one isntfor you. However, if you can accept the subpar graphics and music this game will provide hours of fun. The box that you draw on isnt the best piece of equipment, but thats half the fun! If you pick up the pen from the drawing surface good luck finding where to put it back down to complete your drawing. its hilarious...but not worth more than 20bucks."
1,Didn't work at all...don't bother,You are better off getting out paper and pencils to play this game instead of trying to use this on your TV. The drawings look like you are playing with a 2 year old.
1,You will be disappointed,"We use to play Win Lose or Draw with groups and an easel and had lots of fun. So we looked forward to this game and have attempted only twice to play it because the graphics are horrible. With all of the modern technology for video games, it is difficult to imagine that this game could not be made better. I will attempt to get refund."
1,"If you enjoy Win, lose or Draw be prepaired to lose.","I was so disappointed with this game I returned it to the store within the hour. My family has played the original Win, Lose or Draw game since it came out, and would love to have an expansion pack. I was very excited with this product. Yuk. You can't even draw a stick figure successfully in the time allowed. If you have fun watching others drawing this poorly save your money and take turn drawing with your eyes closed.The way this works - you use move the pen around on the pad to move the cursor. you push down with the pen to draw. It's a real challenge to move the cursor to a new location to start drawing the second line. Most of your time will be used just getting the cursor to the new location. If you have a word that would take 2 drawings you might as well give up."
1,Just kill me now....,"This is the most horrible present I ever got! My mom had good intentions and I gave it a shot but drawing is impossible! This is a total waste of money, but if you like the game concept try playing yahoo graffitti on yahoogames.com. Think a free online version of this game...that actually works....in color.....that works..."
3,"Win, Lose or Draw Video Game","This game is OK, but we find that we don't actually play the game. The little kids mess with it more than anything and watch the TV screen as they scribble on the pad. Glad I didn't pay full price."
2,A Beginners Book Through and Through,This is a good book for the novice developer. It's more a beginners VB guide than a .NET tutorial. I am taking a.NET class and this is the required book. I was hoping for more. Not enough discussion about .NET. A better book would have been VB .NET The Tutorials by Karl Moore which I have also. The ultimate .NET book in my opinion is Programming Microsoft Visual Basic .NET (Core Reference) by Franseco Balena.
3,just an ok book,"This book is great to get your feet wet in VB.NET because it has great tutorials on how to do the basic things in VB. The teaching style is pretty good keeping a good pace through-out the book and almost every single explanation is very well written. Also, all code examples worked for me.The problem that I have with this book is that it fails to introduce the reader to the big picture. This book will show you how to do all this handy-dandy stuff and after reading it, you will easily be able to build your own applications but you wont have a true understanding of VB.NET. You won't have a clue how all of it works together wich will put a demper in your coding abilities. I would only recomend this book if you buy it along with another book such as; [...]"
4,A RELIABLE INTRODUCTORY,"The name of this book is consistent with its contents. It provides a comprehensive step-by-step way of learning the entire Visual Basic .NET procedures. Beginners are its main target. Advanced users need not waste time and money on it. In fact, the only way a non-beginner would enjoy it is by using it as a quick memory refresher.In addition to its simplified Visual Basic .NET language, it treated the fundamentals like the Visual Studio, XML Web Services and object-oriented programming principles with enviable expertise.This is one of the most remarkable and reliable introductory texts currently on sale. However, expect to find some its topics a bit summarized."
3,"Good for beginers, Poor for Experienced Developers","I purchased this book as part of a package, and although I didn't pay full price for it, I would say to any experienced developers that you could live without this book. As a developer for 14 years in various languages, I spent most of my time turning the pages as it told me nothing that I didn't already know.That said, if you are new to programming, then I would suggest that it's a great place to start as all the examples are well documented and the book does cover all areas of development."
1,Useless,This book leaves you with no usefull knowledge in accomplishing anything other than following cookbook instructions.BIG gaps in providing anything usefull: No details in binding to and formatting grids or other form objects.
5,STEPS AHOY...,Great book no trouble with it at all. I also bought the VC++.net which was great. don't bother with the C# it isn't worth the STEPS you have to click to to buy it.
2,Not enough .Net framework,"This book basically introduces you the the basic building blocks of VB.Net. One of the good things about the book is at the beginning of each chapter it tells you what changed between vb6 and .net. The book is way too basic, especially the first couple of chapters. And the examples are way too watered down. You won't have the knowledge to build anything beyond simple apps. Also the book barely discuses the .Net framework, so I don't much about how it works."
3,Deceptive advertising by FishUSA,"I have used these lures with mixed results. I prefer Panther Martins personally especially their yellow body and blade spinner with red dots. Absolutely deadly. What I hate though is when an Amazon seller lists something at ridiculous prices but marks it down 99% to a realistic price to make themselves look good. Case in point, FishUSA lists this lure that can be bought at any store that sells fishing gear for $519 but then marks it down to $3.95 making it look like it's 99% off! This is a real problem for Amazon and I hope they do something to curb this deceptive practice. I've made a personal resolution not to do business with any Amazon seller employing this ""technique""."
2,Preposterous,"This movie must have taken place in a parallel universe where the laws of physics don't apply, because much of it was ludicrous. I know it's an action movie, and I can suspend disbelief as much as the next person, but some scenes were just insulting. Some examples: the way he removed the bomb underneath the car, using a jet-ski to catch a school bus, driving while straddling two building roofs, dodging many bullets, and the final showdown are just a few. But that isn't it - the movie also sports the most incompetent/stupid henchmen ever, with the cops (US Marshalls) a close second.I liked the first 5-10 minutes, and the ""Lola"" character was something different, though she could have been utilized a little more. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it."
3,"5 Stars for the Action, 2 Stars for the Plot","The action and fun quotient is way up in this stylish movie; all you need to do is suspend disbelief and taper your expectations if you were looking for a movie that makes you think. This movie does not make you think, it is an in your face thrill a minute short flick that passes for decent time spent."
2,Nah...I would skip this one.,"I love Transporter 1 and 3. This one not so much. Some of the stunt scenes are ridiculous a lot of the times laughable. The girl villain is not sexy; just really annoying. The overall approach ""jump the shark"". As much as I love to watch the Audi A8L you really can skip this one."
4,great intertainment,I am a big fan of the Transporter series the story line was great. Jason as usual does a good job in this one.
3,Very clever,"I've seen the first film a couple of times and thought that whilst it was OK and Jason Statham can just about act it was nothing special. I really wanted to hate this, but came away liking it quite a lot. The filmmakers knew what they wanted here. Its brainless entertainment with tongue firmly in cheek, and they know it....In fact I enjoyed it more than the first film. The villianess in bra and panties, endless ridiculous car chases, fight sequences that have to be seen to be believed. Its all done with style, panache and a ""don't care if this is not real"" attitude that other films , that take themselves too seriously (i.e. Mission Impossible 3) could learn from.So if you let it wash over you, you will have a entertaining hour and 3/4. Don't think about it just enjoy!"
3,Farfetched,"This is my least favorite of the transporter movies. The plot was weak, the action was farfetched. Jason Statham ofcourse is absolutely gorgeous and the only reason to watch it."
3,Transporter 2,The Transporter 2 is the action packed ride of the summer. The fighting styles are dazzling. Jason Stathom is at his best.
2,Easily could have been a 3 or 4 with some better execution with the story.,"I loved how this movie starts out with the joke to the kid about the doctor, he seemed to be playing his character from Snatch. This movie actually goes downhill from this point on. It had some pretty good fight scenes, but Statham takes liek 20 minutes to disbatch like 10 guys. He's obviously not very fast, but they he could have taken care of the baddies quicker. And I'm not talking about anything but the action, it would be way too hard to recall the story, I;m already starting o feel sick this of this stupid ass movie again. I had more fun watching Exit wounds or timecop."
2,Don't expect much and you will be happy,"The original was a very clever film with just the right balance of action. This film tries hard to duplicate the formula, almost to the extreme, but with poor results. One of the fight scenes is original, and the attempt at style is there, but the story is thin and some of the driving scenes leaves the suspension of disbelief completely out the door."
2,A fun movie if your looking for some entertainment...,"First of all, if you like logical plot sequences, realism, and overall believability in your movies....this is not for you. However, if you enjoy supermodels in stilletos and lingerie packing some serious fire power....this movie's gold.This is an action flick and is fun to watch. 'The Transporter' is really only a chaeffeur with some quick witted MacGyver moves in this particular movie. However, there are definately plenty of high energy driving scenes (he is a very good driver). Amber Valletta was good in this movie as was Jason Statham. However, Lola was by far my favorite character in the entire movie.In conclusion, it is what it is....and that is an action film in its most realistic looking unrealistic form."
2,Too Ridiculous to Enjoy,The action was so ridiculous and unbelievable it became absurd. Just make him Superman in Transporter 3 with a flying indestructible Audi that defies all laws of physics.
2,"British Over the Top, Stereotypical Action Film.","This second Transport film with would be tough guy Jason Statham picks up where the last one left off. You know, over the top action with impossible events and the ability to evade bullets along with bullet-proof doors and cars - when you need them most.If you have seen any of these films, then you will know that they keep trying to push this Statham guy on us even if we do not like him. I just hate stereotypical character like this guy. Not clean shaven,low voice, cocky and like Steven Segal - invincible!The Europeans clearly think that we want over the top, crazy action with impossible escapes and fight scenes. Of coruse, these action guys are so brave that they will do anything to get their target. This film is only good to watch to say that you saw it. Anyone who loves these films enjoys unbeliveable action. Superhero films are more realistic!"
2,"Dear Lord, help us all, or teach us physics.","For the record... The Transporter 2 has beautifully clever and choreographed fight scenes. The rest completely blows chunks. The chase scenes in The Island were better. The required-by-law ""hot"" girl of the film was fubckIng nasty. Save your money. The first Transporter was waaaaaay better. Though, we did come up with a good marketing tagline.... UZIs : Ugly Guns for Ugly Girls. So, I hereby award this movie with a boat-load of stinky fish and a super hot chick."
2,you would think in 2005 they would have more realistic special effects,What the hell was that plane scene about lol. That was the most ridiculous thing i have ever scene. my god.
4,Transporter 2,WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE TRANSPORTER MOVIES. IF YOU DON'T THEN THAT IS REALLY ASHAME. THEY ARE SUCH FUN AND JASON STATHAM IS ONE COOL DUDE FOR A BALDING LEADING MAN. JUST PLAIN COOL.
4,I like movies like this,"This film isnt a comedy, but plenty of scenes make you smile. I think thats the films intent, it doesnt take itself seriously at all. But at the same time the film is no joke, the actors play it straight for the most part, and the special effects and action are first rate. Its very nice seeing it in hi-def also, everything is bright, there are lots of visually interesting scenes. In some scenes the detail really pops in hi-def.Really this is a B-movie plot in the best sense of the word, a film that sucks you into its world, is unpretentious and just fun.If you demand your films to be ultra-realistic in all respects this probably isnt for you. If you like movies that show the action with a wink and a nod, and are just for entertainment. Then you will enjoy this film. Its a lot of fun in my opinion."
3,This sequal is an ok one.,"I really liked the first movie in this series. The second one I liked, but didn't like as much as the first one. This sequel just kept to one story about a little boy that was kidnapped. This movie still holds the action of the first, but I don't think is quiet as strong as the first one. I am a person that does like sequels and likes most, but this one isn't as strong. If you are a Jason Statham fan and you like the action in movies, then I recommend this one. Remember that this sequel doesn't have the ""complexity"" of the first one."
3,Plot? What plot? Action? Yes. Acting? no way.,"We know things are going to be pretty silly when the opening driving sequence is in an automatic. Let's watch the Transporter power shift an automatic trans. What skill, what cunning, what a load.Car stunts? Plenty. They're so over the top that I expect to see ""acme"" stamped on the side of the car and hear a ""beep beep"" as the Road Runner escapes yet again.If you're looking for a no-talent, underfed waif with size negative a cup and Tammy-Fae taste in makeup, here she is. Sexy she is NOT. Come on?! There was potential to make this chick a threat, nay, even an equal to our Transportation Dude. The director opted in for the ""I have not eaten in six months, can't do makeup, don't know how to act, full-auto clips that don't run out"" look. Pathetic.Sure, it was mindless (mindnumbing) entertainment. But when it was (finally) over, I expected the Loony Tunes ""That's all folks"" - it was that cartoonish."
1,I did not care for Transporter One.....,"What made them think we want to see a second movie, when the first was pure crap?! I do not know but the plot looks like it was listed from a bad issue of DC Comics."
1,overstock deals sucks big time.,"ordered the 3 movies in this series. second movie came from overstock deals. went to play it friday 1/25/2013- and it did not work. i mean the blue ray just did nothing.thought maybe it was my player. long story short 12 hours later- it was a defective disk. ever see anything from overstock, i will be sure NOT TO BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM."
5,Transporter 2,"IMO, better than the first one! Cinematography grade A, action sequences awesome, it was perfect! I love this movie and highly recommend it."
3,Loved the action! Hated the music!,"I love Jason Statham. He is worth watching. I loved both movies, however I believe that Stanley Clarke's score in The Transporter made the movie and if the producers are smart they will make sure Stanley will be doing the score in #3. The action in Transporter 2 was great but the music was redundant and boring."
4,A Notch Below the Original,"Let's start by saying ""Transporter 2"" suffers oh so slightly compared to it's predecessor because it's byzantine central plot and the villains are somewhat cartoonish. That said, star Jason Statham as Frank Martin has lost none of his charismatic appeal from the first film. He still amazes with his physicality in the action sequences. It should be noted that the director of the original film, Cory Yuen, choreographed these scenes. Terrific vehicular scenes most notably one where Frank pursues a bus with a speedboat and another where he dislodges a bomb from the bottom of his car with a crane. Popcorn entertainment at it's best. I can't wait for the next installment."
2,Oh so silly,"I'm a complete (....) for a great action flick, and I can't lie, I enjoyed this on a certain level, a certain, really dumb, turn your brain off level, but jeez, this was so silly and so dumb, it kinda hurt...things like chasing planes with cars, and oh, in another absurd stunt, the Transporter is able to somehow launch his car airborne, twist it in mid-air and knock an attached bomb off, on a (if I remember correctly) hook from a crane...and why indeed did that wacky chick strip to her underwear everytime she mixed it up...admittedly great eye candy, but, call me old fashioned, there oughta be some reason, some motivation, that makes sense, at least in this universe...so overall, I kind of enjoyed this, but afterwards I felt....slimed..."
2,Stupid,"Some great fight scenes here and there but all ruined by cheesy music. Im a fan of this guy and his performance in snatch, but the transporter movies are lacking. A little too ""James bond-y"" for me.Go watch a Denzel flick, like Man on fire instead. He doesnt flip any cars upside down there and doesnt deflect missiles with tray tables."
1,Blu-Ray Review,"Check out this person's review: 1 of 4 people found the following review helpful:Keep on Truckin', January 12, 2008By T. Kazalski ""Rock Expert"" (New Orleans, LA) - See all my reviewsNot quite as good as the first movie but it still holds you attention.The Blu-Ray version is awesome. Time to cease product of low-def DVD's and go Hi-Def only starting now. Only a person with no standards would watch a low-def movie when Hi-Def is available.And now for mine: Only a person who likes to throw away money on Blu-Rays that come with no extras cannot be too smart."
1,Awful!!,"Just ridiculous, and not FUN like True Lies which may have some unrealistic stunts, but this has BAD ACTING, and BAD WRITING, unlike classic action films like Die Hard, True Lies, The Killer, True Romance to name a few. This was just a waste of time. I'm not sure why anyone would think this is a fun movie. You want fun action, rent the other I named herein."
1,"Bad. Really, really bad","The fetching Mrs. Brew wanted to see this one, but she was busy one night so I watched it with my teen son. When she returned, she was disappointed that we watched it without her. My son told her, ""Don't sweat it mom, it was just really bad acting and explosions.""'Nuff said."
3,Not as good as original,"If you liked the original then you just may like this sequel. But not if you like plot,story line or common sense."
3,Truly entertaining...,"Honestly, I didn't expect much from this sequel. The first one was good, but it didn't make an impression on me after seeing it. Well, give this movie 5 minutes and you will be in for a sweet treat! Granted, the action scenes are somewhat far-fetched, but once you let go all logic and reason you won't be able to press STOP.Great actions scenes, lesser cars and chases, but the action never seems to stop. The females in this film are a real eye candy, and the cars are unbelievably cool. Pay attention to the original score, mixed with the action sequences it really kicks a**...Like any action film made by Luc Besson (even when he's not directing) you know that it's too much to be true, but it's sure fun to watch.I was not going to give it 5 stars, since it is not a milestone in film history. I gave it 3 because I felt I didn't waste my time, I really had a great time watching it."
3,"""Transporter"" Part Deux","""I'm in need of a Transporter.""""I'm listening."" - Master Transporter, Frank Martin can hear his next customer now in ""Transporter 2""Decent sequel to the ""Transporter"" has Frank Martin doing a favor for a friend by watching over a Senator's young son. But, when the boy is kidnapped by terrorists The Transporter puts it into overdrive to retrieve the boy & take out the terrorists. Things get worse when Frank finds out that the boy has been injected with a deadly virus that kills everyone that comes in contact with him. Frank has less than 4 hours to retrieve the antidote & stop the spread of the disease. Good luck.The film is just about non-stop action with the usual intercuts of the family going through the worried argueing phase, while the cops try to formulate a plan.The film has a few flaws. The CGI action is terrible. Leading to a lot of ""Yeah, right!"" sequences that almost sink the film entirely. Jason Statham is great as the transporter & holds the film together."
2,"Is it Bond, or fantasy martial arts?","Frank Martin returns in a situation he would never choose to be in, acting as a driver and body guard (more or less) for a little rich boy.I don't mind the lame premise of the movie as I can appreciate mindless action flicks as a diversion. But there wasn't enough plot to keep me really interested, and the movie couldn't decide if it was James Bond pushing the technical envelope, or a Kung Fu movie where the moves are a bit magical (and less than plausible).The acting was bland and the directing poor. It felt like an number of scenes were shot and chopped together to make a film. It is never really made clear why the evil one's patrons want all those people dead, and how the virus would really work.Using well worn cliche characters didn't help either: a beautiful tough woman wielding heavy weapons with not a soft spot in her heart or the tall, dark, handsome evil assasin.An OK diversion, but not good cinema."
4,A Sequel That is Better than the Original?,"This happens rarely in film, but The Transporter 2 is much more focused and tighter than the original, which I also liked. Move over James Bond, because Jason Statham returns here as the ultra cool Frank Martin. What Bond does with guns and gadgets, Frank Martin does physically with his body and various appliances that may be lying around. The creative fight scenes are on par with the original with my favorite being the one with fire hose towards the end. I must admit that the whole plane scene contains some of the worst CGI I have ever seen and it nearly ruins that part of the movie. Like the 007 films, leave logic and realism at the door, so you can just enjoy the ride that The Transporter 2 takes you on."
1,Horrible,"This is without a doubt the most stupid movie I have ever seen.I watched the first Transporter, wasnt to bad. But this was just horrible.It was so stupid ,its funny."
3,Decent plot.......,"I really liked Transporter 1, Transporter 2 just didn't cut it for me as much.I really like the character, Martin. However, the skinny blond was so out of place. Not only is she a terribly unattractive female, her acting is so sub-par, she actually ruins a film.Decent enough plot. I liked the kidnapping theme only to have it turn into something else. Came as a surprise. The ending was a little disappointing, but did leave it open for more films.Overall, I like the action packed Transporter movies. I hope they keep making them."
2,I think I'm going to overload,"I wanted to like this; it's filmed stylishly, I like how it gets to the point, and I can suspend disbelief with the best of 'em, but...yes the bullets not going through the WOODEN door, the model airplane, the way the film ends is a total let down, we don't even see how he gets the antidote out the guy's body! and what is with this guy not hooking up with a single dame in the whole flick? That lady who threw herself at him is plenty attractive, uh...oh never mind."
4,Fun to Watch,"I enjoyed this movie very much. The action is silly but fun. The required hot girl of the movie isn't very sexy at all. The music is cool and Jason Statham is also. Like the first movie, The Transporter there is a lot of fighting. I think there is more action in this one. There are some laughs and comical characters. Lose your mind for awhile, forget about the laws of gravity, and watch Transporter 2!"
4,"Well, would you rather be late or *dead*?","The true draw of this film is very simply the action. There are great action and fight sequences from beginning to end, with no drawn-out lulls in between. The plot isn't all that great. As a matter of fact, it's quite formulaic, as there is an all-too-common band of criminals with a plan that's setup for the hero to foil. Yet it is done well in this movie. The budget seems to be larger than that of the first film, making for more action and larger stunts.This is a good movie - definitely worth watching, especially for action fans."
5,Intense martal arts + car chases + gun action + explosions = Box Office Hit Movie!!,"""Transporter 2"" was absolutely awesome!!! I never thought it'd be as good as it was. Almost as if you combind James Bond and an old school Jackie Chan movie into one hell of an action exciting film! The phenomenal yet totally off the wall action stunts got me right into the movie. It's definitely Jason Statham's movie that will make well known like Arnold Swarzenegger. Jason Statham will become the next action star."
4,Action movies are great. Perhaps a step further than needed?,"I like action movies as much as anyone I am sure. From time to time they go a step beyond what they should. This one there is a place or two where it is just that. Beyond the limits of physics, and reason.However that being said, lots of great action, entertaining movie, some great stunt driving. You will not be overwhelmed by the acting but that being said there wasn't a performance so bad it made you question the casting director. Everyone was at least adequate. I am a huge fan of the star and like him, and will see his other stuff again and again but if you are looking for a fantastic movie, with a great plot this isn't it. If you want action this is your movie.[...]"
4,the movie is really good,"what i really wanna say is that this movie is really good but its not better than the previous one, the ransporter is much better and story is much better. thats really good."
2,action: cars and fists,"A new ""superman"" who never gets hurt,but deals out damage left and right.Plot is sort of clunky... he's a driverof get-away cars, not children to school.And a virus designed to kill international drugdiplomats and world officials?But the stunts scenes are first class...just not very believable by anyone above the age of 10.I'm sure the Japanese loved it."
3,TRANSPORTER 2 Heads the Wrong Way!,"Slick and stylish like the original TRANSPORTER, but TRANSPORTER 2 loses ground when the stunts go into overdrive. When incredible action sequences are mixed with moments of ""oh, come on,"" you have just crossed the line. The action is intense. But the story is not only silly, but if you take half a second to think about it, it's completely pointless. A child is injected with a virus that is spread by breath. The idea is that whoever he breathes on will get the virus and the real targets will be killed. The silly part is that the bad guys have the antidote, but go through incredible extremes to inject the kid. Why don't you just take the stuff yourself, breathe on the kid, then take the antidote, and you're done? Maybe I'm just over-analyzing, or maybe the movie is just that silly."
4,"Great as always, but no DTS?","Well, I have no much to say. I've always liked the Transporter series. I am working my collection of the 3. However, Amazon says it has a DTS audio track - where is it? The DVD has not a single DTS track authored onto it. It doesn't make it unplayable, but thats certainly one of the reasons for buying the movie..."
4,Transporter (Special Delivery Edition),"I though I reviewed both of these DVDs last week. Excellent condition, as advertised, no problems, would/will buy from again."
2,You have GOT to be kidding!!,"What can I say about this movie except it has to be one of the worst I've ever seen! It starts out okay, but goes down hill fast. I do admit there are a few good fight scenes, the driving was cool too, but the rest of it was poorly acted and completely unrealistic. What I really want to know is what was up with that woman running around in her underwear shooting up everything?! That was totally ridiculous! Then I found myself actually laughing during most of the action scenes because they were so stupid, especially the one where he was chasing a plane in his car. I mean come on, how did he end up inside the plane, and what happened to the car? Did I miss something?!Bottom line, don't bother wasting your money on this one, it's really not worth it."
1,NOT BUYING THIS DVD VERSION!!!,"I liked the first transporter and I bought the DVD. After some months they was close to come out with ""transporter 2"" Came out with another version of the first transporter with more extras and DTS sound. And double dip us like most DVDS releases these days..I work hard for my money and getting smart of these double dip studios B.S these days!And suck up more money from us. This time for sure not going to get this version DVD and be a smart pants and wait for the DTS version, like they did with last one. FOR SURE going to be another version of this one too! Yes I loved the movie was a lots action and was great.But if u want to see it just rent it for now. I guess better be safe then sorry."
5,The title says it all,"This book shows side by side basic to C code. Luckily basic and C are so similar that you do not have to change paradigms to take advantage of the power of C. If you were going from COBOL to C, a side by side reference would get you in trouble; you would end up with a COBOL program written in C. This program would be bulkier after compiling and run slower than the original COBOL. Basic on the other has is not so restricted in coding form and also can take advantage of PEEK and POKE to do addressing and take advantage of VECTORS. This book is not comprehensive of either language. It is a practical starting point. There are ten chapters and a summation. There are no appendixes."
2,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"Thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the 1-1/2 hp P-C plunge router set with table. You get what you pay for. No problem with router but the table is VERY sub-standard. The fence adjustment is LOUSY. One wing nut holds each sliding fence and is almost impossible to get it square to the working surface due to the slop in the design. Too much wasted time is spent both aligning the fences to the table and to each other. The lightweight construction (cheap) allows the table to move around quite a bit when running material thru...be sure to clamp/bolt it down before use. The miter slot is rough and the slide is sticky. The only minor positive is the dust chute works adequately when connected to the shop vac.In hindsight, I should have bought the router alone and looked elsewhere for a quality built piece of equipment. Now I'm forced to use it until I can build one that is suitable."
2,Porter Cable Drops The Ball,"I am usually a big fan of Porter-Cable products, but this one is a dud. The fence is clumsy and hard to adjust, the miter gauge slot has substantial slop in it, and ridges in the table are rough and sometimes mark work. I bought it as part of a 3 piece kit - the ""Ultimate Router Workshop."" The cost was less than as a stand alone piece, so I'll probably keep it. If I had purchased it as a stand-alone item, it would be returnsville! If you're serious about owning the PC 1 1/2 hp routers with both bases, purchase them separately and pony up the extra cash for a more refined table. You'll thank yourself later."
2,"Difficult to setup, but does the job","This unit is made of light weight materials with inexpensive mechanicals that make it difficult to setup. The fence is hard to use, as it uses a simple L-bracket from the fence to the table with a twist-screw to tighten down - often changing the position as the screw is tightened. Forget using it without seriously clamping the unit down to some solid surface, as there isn't enough mass to hold it in place. This said, once set up, the unit works fine and is very portable."
2,Not up to PC standards I expected,"I just bought one of these and already am having second thoughts about keeping it. Like alot of others, I thought by buying a PC product it would be top of the line. First, the table looks unfinished with both the front and back wide open. Second, the darn thing only has two inserts. One with a small opening and the other with a huge opening. I think everyone that reads this should call PC and complain about that. How much trouble could it be to provide another insert with this table. Oh yes, by the way this metal insert (nothing but a big washer)just lays in the the hole unattached and bounces around when in use.Lastly, this router table is better than some I saw, but then again it should be...[for the price]."
5,This worked great!,My husband made me a book case and needed a router table to add a detail to the front of the shelves and outer boards. This table was perfect with his porter cable router. My book case is beautiful!
5,The Trisection Problem. Robert C. Yates,"Book in excellent condition, excellent envelope and fast service. I strongly recommend to buy at Michener & Rutledge Booksellers, Inc."
2,The insert rings are a pain!!!,"The router plate seems to be pretty decent and the install & setup was easy enough without the additional cost of the optional install template/kit. But I'm most umhappy with the insert rings. Even after sanding them around the edges as recommended, they are still difficult to pop in and out, and now I've cracked the innermost insert ring trying to take it out!!! BTW - I emailed Rosseau for a replacement a week ago and have not had any reply. The next router plate I purchase will not be from Rosseau - I will probably go with one of Rockler's models."
4,"Works well, but a little tricky to set up","If you can get a plate pre-drilled for your router I'd go that route, getting the holes drilled just right was a little tricky."
4,Rousseau Base Plate,"Not a lot to say about this product. It is made of very solid material and is very easy to install. Getting the router centered on the plate is the hardest part of the install and this was made easy by the circle marks on the bottom of the plate. All you have to do is find the set of circles that is the same size as your router base and clamp or tape it down.I would have given this product a 5, but the center rings are a little difficult to remove. I like to use the plate just as much out of the table as in so i am ordering another to install on my second router."
4,So Far ... So Good,"I just ordered and have installed one of these plates in the router table I am building. Before ordering this model, I was somewhat concerned after reading the other online reviews but went ahead and took the chance. My plate was easy to install and mount my router to. The snap in rings are not the easiest to get in and out but on the other hand I don't want them popping out on their own. It is a sturdy plate and the installation instructions were easy to follow. Look forward to years of service from it."
4,Good inexpensive router plate,This plate kit is well made and relatively easy to mount in my new router table top. The company included a good leveling system and reasonable directions. They should have included the template for cutting the hole. I used two carpenters squares to make a guide--it worked quite well.
1,Nope!,"This plate is a ""deluxe"" piece Junk!The 1/32""+ ""crown"" that the brilliant ""engineers"" decided to manufacture into this plate make's any raised panel, edge, or joint forming work infuriating, and impossible to achieve accurately. It also looks very ""cheap"", the top surface is very slippery, and it scratches easily. What initially ""caught my eye"" and made this plate appealing were the ""2in1"" plastic insert rings, they looked like a nice feature. They fit extremely tight though, and removal without a hammer or pry bar was not really possible unless you modified them. Needless to say, I returned it. I purchased a very nice machined 1/4"" aluminum plate from Rockler instead that it IS flat, and has an very nice anodized coating. It works excellent! I highly recommend that you save yourself the time and money I lost and do the same. Keep in mind that the aluminum plates also have different sized inserts you can buy or you can get a solid one that you can drill out for a custom size."
2,I don't think so...,"I purchased this two years ago. I actually have two of them. Part of my purchase was based on positive feedback from the postings below.Problem: This plate is NOT flat. The slight ""crown"" is enough to mess up any precision work. You cannot do any type of miter work with this plate. You can forget about rail and stile doors. Just comes out sloppy and you end up wasting material!Furthermore, the plate can sag with a ""memory"" effect over time, especially if a heavy router is left on the table.The rings are a bear to get out and don't leave you with a lot of flexibility for the size of hole you may need.This is a mediocre product. It is relatively inexpensive, but will be wasted money if you buy this and get a flat (e.g. al aluminum) plate later on. Probably okay for routing that does not involve joinery or a great deal of precision."
1,the bulge ruins it,"I bought this to use for a router table I was planning to build. Because I was gathering materials, I didn't actually open the package till it was too late to return it. Like the others, I found a very noticable bulge across the center. It was supposedly a feature so that heavy routers would pull it flat. Well, my 3 1/4 hp Triton router wasn't heavy enough to do so. There is no way for me to get the plate flat with the table and buying a heavier router is not an option just to see if it will flatten out my router plate. It doesn't really matter if any of the other features are good or not if its an unusable product."
2,It's OK but its not flat.,Its actually pretty wavy. Received mine about 2 weeks ago and setting up a table for it. The surface has waves in it about 0.01 - 0.02 in depth. I was hoping for better. I may chuck it and start over.
4,good,I have just made my router table and so far so good. I'm yet to find out if this will stand the test of time
2,Disappointed with Product,"I purchased this fan to use as a pusher fan for the a/c condensor. When I received the fan, the clip that holds the fan blades in place was missing. I had to return the fan for an exchange. The exchange was easy thanks to Amazon. When I received the replacement fan, I installed it without any issues.The fan worked and moved a good amount of air, but the plastic blades were unbalanced causing a booming noise in the cabin when turned on. I took the blade off and noticed the blade itself was not true and wobbled a bit when spun. I reinstalled the fan and used it for a few more weeks when the motor suddenly stopped working without any warning."
4,A great tale that deserved to be made into a movie!,"I haven't seen the movie, but now I really want to! This book was awesome. It is one of my favorites. I have to admit i don't think it is very scary, but it is a great mystery. It's hard to imagine that someone was able to think up such a strange and enjoyable tale! ."
4,Thriller and Horror Readers will Love It,"Is a must read book for any thriller, horror lover. If you haven't yet read this book, I totally recommend it!!!!!"
3,Make no mistake: It's definitely pulp fiction,"And that makes it squarely average. Bloch was never a great, but always good writer, and Psycho as a book is simply a semi-interestingly told story. Yes, the film was fairly faithful, but the book had its differences. Worth reading if yoiur interest is there. Perhaps the most interesting thing about Psycho is that it was the first work of fiction, written or filmed, based on Eddie Gein's sick handiwork...."
4,EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF NOVEL WRITING,"PSYCHO is maybe the best example there is of how to construct and write a novel.Norman Bates is as fragile as a soap bubble, and Bloch milks Bates' pathology and circumstances for every drop of mayhem possible.But its the architecture of this book that is impressive. Schools should use it to illustrate how you write a masterpiece with chewing gum and duct tape."
3,overrated,"it is certainly not my fault this is considered a classic. horror. thriller. not great, but good, either way. simple plot. superficial descriptions. don't really believe some of the characters. the turn of events are sort of...kitchy? the really great thing here are the story about the mother."
2,"Good idea, but not good writing...","OK! I read PSYCHO after I saw the remake & the original movies. I thought this book would be soooo good since I have been hearing it is better than the movie. So when the new printing of PSYCHO by Robert Bloch came out, I bought, read it, and was very dissapointed. This is a great idea for a novel, but Robert Bloch just doesn't write well in my opinion. I think this book was written in 1959, so maybe that is the reason for the poor writing. I am a HUGE fan of King and Koontz and I thought Bloch would be just as good, but to me if you haven't seen the movie at some parts it is kind of hard to understand because Robert Bloch doesn't give enough detail (like at the end)."
5,...W...O...W...,"goodness. i nevr read this book, but wow. the movie is pretty creepy. i mean, i do not wish to spoil the ending...but, wow. jeezus, alfred hitchcock has a disturbed mind. i mean, adding that twist at the end...ingenious...seriously, fans of AH must see the movie...and many others...WOW..."
2,PSYCHO! No comparism between the movie and book!,"Now we all know Robert Bloch wrote the book a while before Alfred Hitchcock made the famous movie but even so, the book hardly compares to the movie. First of all, like many other reviews stated, it moves lightning fast and it gets really hard to keep up with the plot. Second, the death of Mary (not Marion) Crane is in one sentence (""And so was her head"") in the version I read. I was very dissapointed. I was looking for a long, detailed, and bloody end to Mary that was in some part ""similar"" to the death in the movie. Unfortunatly, that's not what it was. Robert Bloch's ""Psycho"" is no match for the excitment of the movie Alfred Hitchcock created, is definitly not one of the best books i've ever read, and, plus, it is very different from the very different from the movie, so you might be dissapointed Nevertheless, though, if you want a fast-paced thriller with lots of action, Robert Bloch's ""Psycho"" is for you!"
4,"I hate to say it, but the movie was better.","The cliche that ""the book was better"" doesn't always hold true. Even while maintaining that almost all of the important elements in the movie Psycho are found in the book, all the changes made for the movie are changes for the better. The film was right to start with Marion (Mary) instead of Norman. Anthony Perkins is more engaging that the fat, middle-aged Norman we are presented with in the book. And none of the horrific stuff is the same without Hitchcock's masterful direction and Bernard Herman's unforgettable score. But still, it is a great book and well worth the read - even if you have seen the movie first."
2,I saw the movie first read the book second,"Like my title says and I thought the movie was better,mostly because I expected what Norman Bates looked like on screen and in the book,he's totally different.A 40 year old short balding drinker and in the movie we know what he looked like and I couldn't feel sorry for the character in the book when I felt so sorry for Norman in the movie.Other then that,the book is pretty good,it's good to read alone on a scary night.Even though I give this book a so-so review,recommend reading it"
2,B.C. Hunt-needs help,"The video does a decent job capturing the spectacular scenery of B.C. It also does a very good job covering the goat and sheep hunt and explains what constitutes a trophy sheep. However, it does a poor job covering the moose hunt. Too much time is spent on packing the moose back to camp. The real turn-off is the corny music (sheep hunting song) that plays during a large part of the tape. It ruins the hunting mood."
4,An excellent study of white-black relationships 150 years ag,"I was impressed by the willingness of the producers to use the attitudes and language true to the era. Lou Gossett is superb as the ""slave"" as he switches from groveling chattel to Garner's equal and Edward Asner as the sadistic bully."
3,Globe Trekker - Vienna,"While it gives good information about Vienna, it was goofier than what I was looking for."
2,Too bitter,"I like my teas, but this one is too bitter. I did not let this sit too long in the tea pot, but still. I thought it was just too bitter to drink. I think the Irish Breakfast tea is better."
5,Great Intro to the Blues,"So you think you don't like the blues? Well, you definitely need to give this CD a listen. There's a good measure of country and humor in the mix, and *honestly* before you know it you'll be tapping the ""play"" button again. ""Living in a Dreamland"" is one of my favorite tracks. Its soft, gentle sound is indeed dreamy. And being from Memphis, originally, I have a special fondness for ""Holler at Me"". This is just a fun, feel-good CD by a soon-to-be-great from the San Francisco Bay area."
4,A bit too heavy,"For the first time, I traveled across the country with this bag last week. The bag is well designed and stylish with many useful compartments. But it is too HEAVY even WHEN EMPTY compared to the ones that I have used in the past. It's even heavier after it was loaded with a Toshiba Portege and its essential accessories. Portege is not a big laptop. I'm very weight conscious and a minimalist. I use universal gadgets to limit the weight, still did not help much.Wenger needs to use tough but LIGHT-weight material to make these bags."
3,small bag is too big,"When I first opened the bag it was closed. it seemed too big for such a small bag. The dark color was too bright. and lastly, the clock never worked......Dave"
3,"good but too heavy, can be better","I bought this but still debating if I should keep this or not.I like the overall design, but I don't like the weight 3.84lbs is too heavy vs others. For instance, their same bland wa-7444-14 weight only 1.7lbs.I only paid $25 plus tax but I am still not sure if I should keep this or not."
5,Superb product.,"I've actually had this bag for over a year now. It's handle daily use/transport quite nicely. I've never paid particular attention to cleaning or care and yet this bag still looks sharp. One of the best bits about this bag is how much it holds. I keep all kinds of junk in this thing, and it always seems to have just a little more room. I don't make much use of the shoulder strap, so I'm not sure how well it handles use, but the carry handle is very sturdy - again, it's been over a year and I've not had any trouble with it. The zippers are lovely, and operate smoothly. I'd agree that some of the compartments aren't really necessary, but it's not like they get in the way either - and, I do use a few of them. I have no complaints, really, I can't find anything wrong with this product. It definitely looks/feels better then the somewhat cheaper brands. It's not exactly going to hurt your wallet either."
3,HISTORY HISTORY HISTORY..................................,"When you can find this cd on the market, it's great to have it as part of your Beatles collection.The recording is a modern, clean version of what the ""skiffle Beatles"" sounded like. Again, you will not here these songs in the top 40, but it is something worth listening to if for anything else to get the ""flavour"" of the time. From this point came music we all appreciate today.I'd rate this cd ""rare"" as it doesn't come up for sale all that often."
5,Rocks two ways.... Long and Hard!,The entire CD is completely awesome. I am 100% pleased with my purchase.
4,Godsmack in Chains,"Keep Away is an awesome tune, you can hear a little bit of layne staley from alice in chains in sully's voice, best song on there. another great dark song is voodoo."
4,Godsmack is awsome,"I dont have the cd but have heard it from my friends I like the song Keep Away, Bad Religion andGet up, Get out but my favorite cd is KoRn Life is Peachy"
2,Okay (more like a 2.5),"The Alice in Chains influence is all over the place, from Sully's processed vocal style to the Sabbathy, 70s-style riffs. But, Godsmack is definitely a power thrash album, full of loud riffs and pounding drums.This album's rarely better than generic. But, the AIC influence and processed drum sounds are intriguing novelties that makes a few of the tracks here memorable."
4,Good offering from a new generation of musicians,"First off, to the people who can't get over one band sounding like or being influenced by another. Stop listening to anything you have except Black Sabbath, ok? The influences are obvious. There is plenty of Alice In Chains, and lots of Metallica. The intro to the album and some of the segue cuts are right out of White Zombie's La Sexorcisto. What you have here are a group of young men who loved the very late 80's and early 90's sound sprinkled in with some earlier Metallica and of course, Sabbath, who doesn't. That is what they heard and learned to make music. It is strong, aggressive and sticks with you. It isn't perfect as I feel their lyrics are a bit repetitive which hurts the overall structure of the album, but I was skeptical of this band before I had a good listen and they changed my mind. This is also a terrific live act, if you like them go see them."
1,I hate to be the downer... nevermind no I don't,"This just sucks. Listen to the first few seconds of ""bad religion"" and you will see why. What note change do you hear? What's that? There is none? Oh. That's too bad. These guys are just a bunch of female abusing screaming idiots, then they tell you to leave them alone. I mean seriously people... they just yell. And yell. All of their songs are just about beating someone and telling them to go away. Yeah, this is great, isn't it? I take pity on you fools who couldn't find an album better than ""Aqua"" to spend your $15 on. If you really like heavy metal get Korn or Orgy. This is just garbage."
5,Godsmack,Saw them @ Ozzfest '99 and have been hooked ever since. This album started it all and is by far my favorite but their other albums dont disappoint either.\m/
4,Raging debut with a lot of promise,"Godsmack's debut album is one of the few hard rock albums released in the late 1990's where the listener does not need to skip a single track. Lead vocalist Sully Erna's menacing vocals tear through every song on this awesome debut with such ferocity and pain that fans can feel every scream he belts out as if it were their own. The first eleven tracks blister with a hint of Alice In Chains here and there(the band's name was even taken from the AIC tune on 'Dirt'), and in places it does seem that the lyrics tend to be a bit repetitive. But even that doesn't take away from the raw power displayed completely throught 'Godsmack'. The album concludes with the haunting ""Voodoo"", easily the most groove-laden song on the album, and also the record's most abmitious. In a whole, an awesome raging debut from a band with a lot of promise."
3,"Hard, Heavy, and Unoriginal","Growling vocals, thrashing guitars, heavy bass, and mashing drums. Adrenaline pumping - yes. Anything new - no. Godsmack keeps getting compared to Alice in Chains and Metallica, and though I can see where the resemblances lie, it's nothing I haven't heard before. Don't get me wrong, it's a good debut album, but Sully Erna has a problem with saying ""Go Away"" a whole lot. It's a good album, and better than ""Awake"", and Godsmack is a good band, but they lack the melody and originality that made Alice in Chains and Metallica such great bands."
1,More Pop Crap with Lyrics that were given no thought,"Again another classic example of the horrible decay that music has become. All you need is just one riff to play over and over in an album and a Korn wannabe voice to shout over everything. I hate all these sound-alike bands today like Korn, Limp Bizkit, Godsmack. It all sounds the same and is very boring. The worst part about this album are the lyrics. Ummm first Single ""Now Go Away"" Okay next Single ""Keep Away"" What is this garbage!? Just yelling ""keep away"" or ""go away"" or ""get out"" or ""stay away from me cause I am so super cool and a wannabe outcast."" This is so lame, the picture on the front just screams ""Oh look were so hard cord, piercings, ohhhhh scary"" All this is is trendy pop trash."
3,Its okay,"The CD's not bad -- probably a few good songs, timebomb, stress, and voodoo -- but i love the style of those three songs -- much akin to rammstein, lords of acid, etc .. synth fused with heavy guitar and hard bass .. yeehaw!"
1,This isnt good music.,"This album and band arent very original. They sound just like every good rock band, only they arent very good. This band is derivative trash and they stink, if you listen to this then you should put it down and pick up some of the stuff they ripped off, like Alice in Chains for example."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I bought this cd at the advice of some people on the net. BIG mistake. This album is boring and completely unorginal. I've heard everything before. I wanted to like this cd but i just can't. Godsmack is way too overrated and most of the people that have given other reviews probably won't listen to it 2 years from now. It'll be under the stack with the new flavor of the month.
4,Excellent debut for Boston-based hard rock quartet.,"The first thing you will notice about this album is that Godsmack does not follow modern metal trends. There is almost no hip-hop influence, the vocals are melodic and not screamed, and the verses do not get mellow. This is excellent bare bones hard rock. ""Whatever"" is one of the best hard rock songs I've hard in the last five years. I give four stars only for the reason that some of the songs sound repetitive. But I definitely think their followup will be a 5-star album. I recommend it to any Sevendust fans."
5,once again....what do I write here?,"Now that the headliner is out of the way, I might as well tell you about Godsmack's self-titled debut album.It is great. It kicks off with the killer MOON BABY then ends with VOODOO, which is very different from every other track on the CD. My favorite song is TIME BOMB, good to sing to in a bad mood. Every hard rock/metal fan should definitely own THIS one."
2,Unoriginal,"The lead singer has a good voice and ""whatever"" is a good song, but almost everysong has the lyric go away or stay away. They have a good sound but their writing must improve for them to succeed with their sophmore album."
5,Better than some peeps think & is not like AIC!!!!!,"U know I am just not following all u ""rock fans"" when u say GODSMACK is sounds like AIC. Everyone Godsmack doesn't sound like AIC and Godsmack is a much better band. W/ all the hype on saying they sound like AIC I thought I would buy AIC album and I got DIRT. Good c.d not great. Godsmack's album is much more hard core and angry and great 2 listen 2 after u have had a bad day at work. Folks that is my intelligent review of the sound qualities of AIC and Godsmack. I am not saying ""Godsmack sux and AIC rulz"" unlike some reviewers. So do ur self a favor and buy this c.d. This c.d. is much better than the current ""rock"" we have been served (LB, KoRn, and Orgy). No disrespect 2 those bands I think they kick a$$ 2. But Godsmack BEATS A$$. Not only is the music cool but each song as a differnt texture 2 it and the songs don't sound the same. Their I have said my peace. Peace out yall."
5,a kick cd,"This is one of the best CD's i have ever owned, i think it was gotten me to listen to rock more. Great release"
5,Great to listen to why riding in the car,Totally great CD loved every second of it would highly recommend it for anyone who likes it hard and can definitly want to get into some music
5,Best bands,"Yeah, people say they sound like like alice in chains, well not really, Godsmack is bad ass, and they didn't get their name from AIC but a joke they had between them. Anyway, this is a bad ass album, that you would love. buy it. hehe"
2,Cutting edge...ground breaking.......not really,"Think this guy sounds like the guy from alice in chains.... that's not all, their name Godsmack is taken from an alice in chains song off the dirt album? My god how original...."
5,This is the best ever!,"Yeah it sounds some what like Alice and Chains but not much. It is alot better then Alice and Chains. I think that all the people who don't think they are good should listen to the whole thing not just the song off the radio. I first heard the song ""Whatever"" and i new i needed to get the c-d and i'm gettin it soon. My friend has it and i listened to the whole c-d over and over again and now i memorized it! So if you haven't heard this c-d uncut then you should go out and by the c-d."
3,Alice in Chains' kid brothers,"I thought it was the new Chains release at first. Yes, it sounds good, but it doesn't sound original like the way Korn or Pantera does. Its a decent album for metal, while we are all awaitng the new Chains release, this will fill the gap for a moment. Another note, it looks like the band (Besides getting the name from Alice in Chains) seemed to have designed the album from the Dirt album. the sun logo, the song tittles and such."
1,dogsuck,"Of all the ""metal"" bands to garner some success in the last decade, this is the worst of them, down there with Buckcherry and Creed. The problem is that there is nothing original about them. The guitar soloes sound like a poor copy of Kirk Hammett and the riffs sound like meat-headed approximations of Kim Thayil. Oh, and the singer is a ""warlock."" Soooooooooooooooo scary. Oooooh. Thank god that metal is making a comeback in the underground and above. Bands like Pelican actually try to make new sounds, use new compositional styles. And rock like mad!!! Mastodon adds free jazz drumming to the aggressive mix. More takers? Everyone will remember to forget dogsuck soon after the new renaissance of metal. Hasn't been one like it since Soundgarden put hair metal in the dust. Post-metal like Pelican, etc. will put this macho junk in the dust as well."
1,"can you say, ALICE IN CHAINS!","This band is like one big alice in chains rip off/ cover band! EVEN THE NAME IS AN ALICE IN CHAINS SONG! I'm not trying to defend AIC, I hate them too! BUT I HATE GODSMACK MORE! This band is boring, and annoying! Their just as over hyped as Static-X, Blink-182, and Limp Bizkit! STAY AWAY FROM THIS GOD AWFUL BORING, UNTALENTED, UNORIGINAL ALBUM!"
1,Just Horrifying,"YEAH YEAH YEAH BABY KEEP AWAY FROM ME! That pretty much sums up the lyrical content of this album. You truly cant tell one song or album from the next. Go buy Alice In Chains ""Dirt"". It has a good song on it called ""God Smack"". Obviously you havent heard it if youre still listening to this wretched excuse for music."
5,"Godsmack leaves an everlasting ""smack"" on the music industry","This is a great metal album, if you like guys playing great guitar and yelling expletives left and right, this is for you. This is definitely the CD for you, this is one of the greatest albums of all time, also try powerman 5000, sevendust, static X and slipknot.listen to a couple samples."
1,Alice in Chains Cover Band?,"It is amazing that this band not only totally rips off Alice in Chains, but also has the balls to name themselves after an AIC song from ""Dirt."" Listen kiddies, don't waste your time with immitations; buy the real thing. Go by Dirt or Facelift from AIC."
4,Good album,"This is a good album and was one of the better rock albums of 98.1.Moon baby- pretty good song 4 out of 5 stars2.Whatever-first hit off the album and 5 out of 5 stars3.Keep away- 4.5 stars , good song4.Time bomb- 4 stars5.Bad religion-3 stars6.Immune-4 stars7.Someone in london-4 stars8.Get up get out- 3 stars9.now or never, 4 stars10.stress- 3 stars11.situation-3.5 stars12.voodoo- 5 out of 5 stars, more slow paced- great song and cool video/sullys voice is haunting and distinct and gives band its unique sound. Recomended."
3,3.5 Stars,"Godsmack have a typical mainstream rock sound but really, that doesn't even matter. They aren't original but the way in which they deliver their sound is very catchy but not in a bad way.I usually don't like this kind of rock but after a few listens it grew on me, despite the sometimes over-used lyrics. The odd intros to some of the songs were a welcome addition and I agree that they do give off Tool-vibes with a bit of James Hetfield for good flavor."
3,Potential,"This is a potent band with clean heavy guitar riffs and a great bass and drum correlation and Sully Erna's voice is powerful and potent and explodes from his guts. The lyrics are acceptable for a debut album and they won't get far with that kind of repetition but they are expressive enough and Bad Religion has some good gritty qualities and if it weren't for their drive I doubt they'd amount to much, but for the emotion and hardness that comes out in their music I think they have great potential and with improvement of their lyrical skills they could go very far and make a solid name for themselves. As music to just rock to, without great lyricism, it is a great hard rythmic album that is at the least a display of gritty talent and rage rock."
3,This will do...for the time being,"Godsmack is an above hard rock release for this day and age, but ultimately weak when compared to classics like Soundgarden's Badmotofinger, Alice in Chain's Dirt, Tool's nima, and so forth. Godsmack's sound is rich with heavy guitar riffs, but seemingly at the expense of meaningful or even well crafted lyrics. Imagine Alice and Chains, minus any sort of intellectual content, and what you've got are tracks like ""Whatever"" and ""Keep Away."" They make for good, heavy listening...though I can't help but feel they are more suited to a life as background music for Extreme Sports highlight clips. They, as a band, do have potential and I hope to see them put out another album or 2. Overall, this album is a good purchase, if only to tide you over until dark, heavy, gloomy hard rock makes its return...whenever that may be."
4,Great Derivative,"this is a really good album, and i love listening to it. almost like a great mix of alice in chains and mad season...there are some songs that almost seem like they're lifted directly from these groups. i hear godsmack rocks in concert and i think they'll be around for awhile. out."
4,Heavy Minimalism,"Some of the greatest albums in metal say the least about musicianship, at least as far as complexity is concerned. Take Metallica's black album, for instance: most of the songs written for Pentatonic minor in the key of E. Rage Against the Machine: simple, fundamental I-iii-V chord progressions. So why do ""us phreaks"" keep coming back to these albums and others like them? The originality of the general sound, as well as the cohesive nature of the expression can bind an album and accent the simplicity used in the music. Godsmack has done the same here. Anger and estrangement are the emphases, and they are eloquently and simply expressed. Good album . . . now let's see them move into some uncharted territory."
2,sellout,"This band has the same format as mettalica the singer the same and guitar the same. My advice is if you have mettalica or dont like them, dont but this CD, it's just another copy of Mettalica and Metallica has been playing for a while. The only reason I would give it 2 stars is because the song voodoo is different and its a cool creepy song."
1,Not a very good CD,"I'm surprised that the lack of song writing skills displayed here could get a band of this low a caliber signed to a major label. I only bought this album because I like ""Keep Away"", and I thought that if that single was indicative of GODSMACK's work (as a single should be), then this self titled debut would be worth my money.....Boy was I wrong. Upon further inspection of the lyrics, 95% of the songs include ""Get Away"" or ""Keep Away"" in their lyrics. Its like the same song over and over again. I still think that ""Keep Away"", the third track on the disc is a great great tune, but I'd wait to buy it until this CD is in the budget bin and Godsmack is back flipping burgers wherever they came from."
3,In a bad mood? Sick of people? Buy this album!,"Don't get the 3-star rating wrong; I do like this album. But Ihave to criticize the simplicityand redundancy of the music and lyrics. The theme throughout is pretty much ""I don't like you--stay away from me,"" and we hear it time and time again. A far cry from Alice In Chains, to be sure. But...That doesn't mean this album isn't worth your dime. The drum work is pretty good. As for the guitar handling, well, I can only advise that you don't listen to Randy Rhoads within 12 hours of listening to this album. The guitar playing is simplistic, but it does at least move the songs along.If you like the in-your-face guitar sound, and you tend to get, well... disgusted with some of the people around you, you may very well enjoy this album."
5,This Band is the S.it!!!,"this cd is awesome! if you like hardcore, mosh pit worthy music, you'll love this cd. the best songs are ""Whatever"", ""Keep Away"", and ""Voodoo"" Sully Robbie Tony and Tommy you all did a great job on your record, and keep it up!"
2,"Godsmack is an unoriginal, un-energetic group","Man, if the lead singer didn't sound exactly like Layne Staley from Alice in Chains, this CD would be a total waste. Every song sounds pretty much the same: grungy riff, gratuitous movie clip, and crummy lyrics. The songs are loud, but not exciting like RATM or metallica. The lead singer has no emotion behind his words. I have a feeling that after these guys have gotten your money they will never be heard of again. They have a serious lack of artistic talent."
5,THE HARD ROCK DONT STOP ON THIS ALBUM!!!!,This is great album to own for any hard rock/heavy metal fan. Its hard rockin all the way through. I love it.
5,"Godsmack, a new mix of metallica, tool, alice in chains...","This is one of the greatest new CD's I've heard in a long time. Not too many new bands impress me much, but the sure power and raw energy of Godsmack is unbelievable! They are very tight in their compositions too. Well written music, a good vibe, an original style, and a great vocal source as well. It's excellent, you should buy it."
5,YEEEEEESSSSSS!,"THIS ALBUM IS GREAT! SONGS LIKE VOODOO MAKE ME FEEL REAL SPIRITUAL, AND JUST ABOUT EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM ROCKS! FORGET SLAYER, FORGET PANTERA, FORGET METALLICA.......BUY GODSMACK! THIS ALBUM IS A DREAM COME TRUE...PEACE OUT! .."
3,"Finally, a tolerable band!","This altogether good album proves that the acceptible '90's rock that started with the Stone Temple Pilots still exists. The album's signature single ""Whatever"" is actually a good head bang worthy track and ""Stay Away"" isn't half bad either. Don't be turned away by the trend appeal, this album (and the lead singer, for that matter) is yummy."
1,"""what's wrong with a clone band, as long as they're good?""",i don't have problems with clone bands...but this clone band ISN'T good
5,IN YOUR FACE: ROCK AND ROLL,Saw them live at the 92.9 WMFS Birthday Bash in Memphis...Went out the next day and bought the CD. Every song is great!...Whatever is my new theme song on life!...Dont wait...get it now....I can hardly wait for the next one.
5,"NEW ,HARD,POST GRUNGE DETRIMENTALLY INFECTIOUS",THE FIRST TIME I HEARD WHATEVER I KNEW THIS BAND WOULD SMOKE GOLDEN CIGARETTES AND PLAY PLATINUM GUITARS THESE GUYS #!*^%$$ ROCK THIS IS METAL WITH PASSIONATE DEGRADATION
4,An Album that is good but could have been better,"Godsmack is one of the newer breeds of metal. They are from Boston and on their self-titled debut entitled ""Godsmack"" it is sort of a dark sound that will grab your attention in a hurry. The best songs are my favorite ""Moon Baby"", ""Keep Away"" and ""Immune"". I was sort of dissapointed with it, but it is an overall good album."
2,Why does every new rock band out of MA has to suck?,"When i first bought this CD, I absolutely loved it!!! But... after a few more listenings, it really began to get on my nerves. Sure, there are a few good tunes on it (""whatever"" & ""someone in london""), but other than that, there is nothing to it! The lyrics are some of the worst I've ever heard. The music sounds so much like everything else on the metal scene nowadays."
4,this CD rocks.. If you like Alice In Chains youll love it,all round well done CD.. this group reminds me alot of alice In Chains in the early days
3,"Can you say ""Alice in Chains""?","Yes, these guys, along with Staind, have brought back Alice in Chains. With convienient Jerry Cantrell-sounding vocals too. Now for all you Alice in Chains fans, you might like these guys. Or not. But if you heard ""Whatever"" on the radio and thought it was cool, don't but the CD without some careful consideration. I don't like Alice in Chains, but I like Godsmack better. They're just not original, and sound too much like A.I.C. If they put out another album that expands their sound some more and is more original, I'll buy it."
2,Am I listening to the same CD?,"I'll admit ""Whatever"" is a cool track, but beyond that this CD doesn't go far beyond that formula. This CD may have been better with a producer because these guys ROCK in concert. I saw them with Pushmonkey and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. Both bands were excellent. The CD just lacks some depth. If you must hear ""Whatever"" constantly then buy it. Mine is at the used CD store."
3,an all right CD,"There's some great songs like ""Time Bomb,"" Whatever,"" ""Bad Religion"" and ""Voodoo"" The rest of the labums average. Nothing great."
3,ummmm...,"I borrowed this cd from my friend and have yet to listen to it. After reading these reviews i'm a little aprehensive about listening to it. Someone please tell me, is this the kind of music that is only meant for heavy metal fans. Or could someone like me (who isn't usually too crazy about heavy metal) like it. I'll listen to just about any music as long as it sounds good but the only alternative music that i usually listen to is punk music, like green day. Someone please tell me, if i like punk music, will i like this album?"
2,Dissappointing,"After reading the reviews about this album I thought it would be awesome. Being compared to the likes of Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, it must be good......or so I thought. As far as I am concerned this is just the same old thing, just poor reproductions of AIC, singing about the most depressing things they can think of to try and win over a few impressionable fustrated teenage fans, who will most probably find this album very deep as they mope around their dark incense ridden bedrooms moaning about how horrible their life is. Oh to be a teenager ! Better Luck Next Time. (Dont)Keep trying."
1,godspank,"Wanna get rich and get laid real quick? Well, just follow the godsmack formula of RIPPING OTHER PEOPLE OFF. Just take any other band, name YOUR band after a song title that the other, good band made up, copy their music style EXACTLY, sleep with the right people, get lots of tattoos, AND YOUR IN. Say if you created a band called ""Freak on a Leash"" and then got a bassist who pounds on his bass guitar and a bunch of dreadlocked guys from Bakersfield and tried to sound exactly like Korn, IT WOULD WORK.Come on people. I can't belive that anyone who's ever heard of Alice in Chains could ever take these dumbasses seriously. I have to sit through them at Ozzfest, so I'm not looking forward to that. How could anyone impersonate someone elses vocal style (Layne Staley) and then have the balls to acctually name your band after his song!!! A.I.C. should sue the hell out of Godcrack, just so we don't have to listen to their weakass music on the radio. Do the world a favor, DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!!!!"
2,No one will remember Godsmack in about a year...,"Like it says in the title of my review, Godsmack will die away with Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc. Monotonous songs, not original at all. Some songs like Keep Away really remind me of Metallica. Somewhat talented but they don't have much to say lyric-wise and 10 years from know, no one will know who they are."
1,bad,Dont listen to the guy below me. They're not a good band. Save your money for the new Pantera cd.
5,Looking for a kick ass CD? This is it.,"Sit back and let this baby blow you away. This CD is one of those that you won't even think about reaching for the ""track skip"" button. I went on a 16 day tour of England and Scotland and had a lot of time to listen to CDs. This one hardly ever left my player. All tracks rock, even the rather odd Voodoo, which is almost hypnotic. You will not be let down. The only bad thing about buying this CD could be it might force you to raise your standards."
5,"Beautiful combination of story, pounding rock, and variety o",Buy it if you love industrial or rock!!!!
2,2 1/2,"Godsmack isn't a terrible band, but they really arent anything special, and are wayyyy over-rated as musicians. Some people think they are the greatist rock band of the modern era, and I just dont see how this is since they are so many better newer rock bands out there (even Lincoln Park seems to be more talented, as in terms of Creativity) Yet, there are some Ok HardRock songs on here (its not Metal people) but there are way to many piss-poor songs on this for me to consider anything higher then 2stars. I will give them another 1/2 star because ""Vodoo"" and ""Moon r excellent songs, but the rest are average and most of them flat out suck. Not something horrid to add to your CD collection, but dont expect much from it."
1,"do not buy, whatever you do","I can think of a whole lot of adjectives to describe this piece of alternative garbage but I won't since I don't want this review to be over a thousand words. Metal fans prepare to be disappointed because this is a complete waste of your time. The band doesn't play music because they like it, they play it for money. If you have this CD, dispose of it immediately."
5,One of the best CD's ever,"This is a great cd. From someone in Massachusetts, this is a great cd. My local station broke this band and I'm glad they did. If they could only release another alblum. I cannot reccomend this cd too highly."
2,Skip the album and see them live,"When I first heard Godsmack's album, I didn't like it. The singer sounded too much like a second rate James Hetfield, and it generally got on my nerves. Then I saw them at Ozzfest '99 and was blown away. These guys can play really well in concert. Unfortunately, upon second listen, the album still doesn't impress me. I can't really explain why, but the rhythm ought to be condensed and faster. I suppose they were just more raw and exciting live. Maybe Godsmack could put out a good ass-whipping second album, but until then..."
2,Too familiar,"These guys sound just like Metallica. Heck, the first time I heard ""Keep Away"" I thought it WAS Metallica. I never liked Metallica, so of course I didn't like this. Voodoo however, is awesome. I love this song. If anything, its the only thing that makes this album good. But thats just one song. Voodoo Rules, Godsmack doesn't."
1,And music falls deep into the abyss....,"Why the hell does this singer try to sound like Layne Staley??? I bought this CD because I heard it's like Alice In Chains. I am STUPID. Alice is my favorite band, and here comes a band who TRIES to sound like Alice, rips off Alice's sound and can't even do it right, and (BLECH!!!) even takes their name from an Alice song.Here's an appropriate analogy:Nine Inch Nails:FilterAlice In Chains:GodsmackTwo good bands, two unoriginal rehashes. If you agree, email me. If you don't email me. I'm just a 14 y/o girl, and I have to ask, why do I have to be a teenager during the time when bubblegum pop and crap like this dominate the industry??? My peers are morons."
1,"Please, i think we've all heard this before.","I had high hopes for this c.d., i mean i couldn't wait to get home and stick in the player. I turn it on. What's this? Did i buy Alice In Chains by accident? Stupid salesclerk must have put someone else's music in my bag. OOPS! wait a minute; it's Godsmack, it's mine,and it's been done again, and again, and again. Save your money, don't make the same mistake i did, if you want to hear somthing original pass this one up- nuff siad. :("
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Wow, what a disappointment. After hearing the 4 radio singles, only the first song comes even close to them. The rest of the songs sound really unoriginal and sloppy. The lyrics are very, very stupid and do not make any sense. But, only buy it if you never heard Keep Away, Voodoo, Whatever, Bad Religion, or Moon Baby."
4,One of the best rock albums out,"THe album is very well done. They are most deffinately one of the best bands around right now. If you like Korn, Metallica, Static-X etc... you'll love this album. One of the songs i really liked is Voodoo - it adds a rather different twist to godsmacks style. all and all a great album a must have for metal/rock fans."
3,Buyer Beware,"This album isn't good or bad all around. It has some really good tracks, but it seems the rest of the album was put in as filler. It's not really worth the price in my oppinion. Listen to a friends copy before buying."
5,EXCELLENT,"this is one of those CD's you've gotta take along on the next roadtrip. great sound, very heavy, these songs never get old. lyrics are awesome, especially in ""bad religion..."" you've gotta love this stuff."
3,"eh, alright","The first time I heard godsmack was on the radio, n the song was keep away, and I thought it was some alice in chains song i've never heard or something, but then they said it was godsmack, anyways onto the review, yeah, their name comes from an alice in chains song, and they do sound like em, but that doesnt mean their bad!, like half the songs on this album are really good, n the other half are average, I still listen to this cd when I'm bored, so if you're into this kind of music you should def. pick it up."
3,Good CD,"First off, this CD is better overall than Awake, but it doesn't have any really heavy songs like Sick of Life and Awake. I am just going to point out the highlights of the CD. Moonbaby and Whatevever are the best songs on the CD, Moonbaby being the best, and Whatever being great, but not as good as Moonbaby. It is much louder however. The rest of the songs are good but not great."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!,This cd is one of my favorites. Everyone needs to stop saying they aren't original. They DONT sound like Alice in Chains. They DIDNT take their name from AIC. It was a coincidence. All the songs have a great heavy sound. Moonbaby is my favorite track on it. I listen to this cd almost every day and it doesnt get old. All the songs are radio quality. Buy this cd and you will be happy with it.
4,good debut album,"Godsmack is one of the better new bands and their first cd rocks.I bought this cd after hearing their 2 singles ""whatever"" and ""keep away"" on the radio and it doesn't dissapoint. Solid from start to finish I would recomend this cd to anyone who likes heavy music and good guitars.This cd isn't perfect though.Sully's vocals start to sound like james hetfield's on some songs and they do sound alot like AIC.And the phrase ""keep away"" or ""go away"" seems to be in almost every song.And most of the songs do sound alot alike.Oh well,it's still a kick ass cd from a good new band. Pick it up."
3,"Less than original, but a very solid debut","I have had this CD for a few weeks now. It seems the more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it.The downside to this band is they are exceptionally derivitive. On some songs they sound similar to Alice in Chains. On other songs they sound like they are flat out ripping AIC off. And while this band is far from original, they are very good. Their music is aggressive, yet melodic. And although none of the members of this band possess a great deal of talent from a pure musicianship perspective, they form a very cohesive unit. The singer, whose voice I enjoy, sounds like the love child of James Hettfield and Lane Staley.The highlights of the album are Whatever, Timebomb and VooDoo."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"my friend is the ""brother-in-law"" of theguitarist and he sent me a copy and i love it..i spoke with him and had to tell him that listening to his band changed my whole view on that type of music....if your out there...thanks lance. i loveyou... godsmack is energizing and it puts you in a mood you never thought imaginable..."
1,Godcrap,"pretty clever, eh? this band sounds exactly like creed, nickleback, stained, and all the other crappy post grunge bands that came out in 97. These guys totally ripped off Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and, of course, Pearl Jam. Hell, some dumbass who reviewed Dirt said Alice in Chains ripped off Godsmack."
2,Alice in Chains Light,"Godsmack, taking there name from an Alice in Chains song, is pretty much the poor man's Alice. They try so hard with their vocals and riffs to sound like AIC but they fail. Add Godsmack to the list of all those generic rock bands surfacing over the last few years, who have little talent and a lot of imitation rock. The only reason they don't get a 1 is because they do have one good song on the entire album, ""Whatever"", however, that is the one song that is the most played out."
2,who really cares if they sound like AIC?,i dont see the problem in godsmack sounding like alice in chains. that isnt really a bad thing. the bad thing is that this band is actually kinda crap. they sound very monotonus and while this might appeal to fans of early 90s grunge it certainly does not appeal to me. the idea of not using guitar riffs and replacing them with one single chord with a bend on the E string every now and then is madness and godsmack should be hung for such treason! go and buy the other side EP instead. it is an entirely acoustic album and it is brilliant. godsmack show what they can do on that album. on this album they just show that they are a bunch of smacked (no pun intended) up losers who are wannabe AIC's and Soundgarden's. sorry 'smack you dont do anythin for me.
1,"do not buy, whatever you do","I can think of a whole lot of adjectives to describe this piece of alternative garbage but I won't since I don't want this review to be over a thousand words. Metal fans prepare to be disappointed because this is a complete waste of your time. The band doesn't play music because they like it, they play it for money. They are a rip off band and just play worn out riffs that you probably heard before. If you have this CD, dispose of it immediately."
1,Hopeless,"I have had a pack of these for a while and they are just terrible. I use a nice NEC DVD burner which is considered by burning pundits (they exist!) to be a really good drive. It's given me no problems ever, except with these disks. After the first burn they work fine but any subsequent burn they are tempermental at best and often do not work at all. Although I can quick-erase (or do a longer erase) and then burn a compilation, the data verification fails most of the time. Ignoring that, and trying to use the CD anyway, results in inconsistent, but generally bad results. For instance, my DVD player (which has had no problems with other media) can kind of run these disks but other CD drives cannot.All in all a major disappointment. My burner can do CD-RW at 24X but even burning these at 16X on a fresh disk results in similar results. They are essentially very expensive one-time use CD-Rs."
1,became useless after 2-3 rewrites,"After I rewrited the disks 2-3 times, I found all became useless. Burning process always failed and disks became unreadable. Do buy Sony, Maxell or TDK instead."
1,Junk,"Does not work. Used these Memorex ultra speed CD-RW's on an LG burner and a NEC burner on windows XP. All 5 CD's in the pack appeared to record on the first try. But no data was there when trying to read the CD's. All 5 of the discs cannot be burned a second time, even after doing a full erase, always getting an ""Illegal Disc Error"" on the LG burner or a ""Write Error"" on the NEC Burner.I purchased a 5-pack of Verbatim 24 times CD-RW. Tested all 5 CD's in the pack. All 5 recorded perfectly twice. One of the CD's has been rewritten more then 50 times so far, without one fail with the same computer set-up and the same LG and NEC burners."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time With Those,"My wife purchased those last year, in spite of the fact that I always use Sony or Verbatim. I saved some of my digital pictures on one, and as I always do backed it up on another one. My wife was able to print some of the pics, thereafter, the 2 cds were unreadable. I lost my data, and am unable to even get any files on those cds. Don't waste your money on those, and most importantly, your unique data."
1,Junky junk,"As I wrote in another review of these disks, on my NEC DVD burner that is rated to do CD-RW at 24X, these disks are abyssmal. Even when I was sure to use a brand new one and not exceed 16X, the disks are good for one burn and any subsequent burns are questionable, at best. I have given up on these. They are expensive one-time use disks and certainly the most useless media I've used since I started disk burning back in 1999.Their quality would not be acceptable even if they were cheap (and they are expensive). They are honestly not worth bothering with if free because they are frustrating. I have some old Memorex 4x disks I've been using for a while and they have given no problem, but these are junky junk and among the worst products I've used in my entire consumer life, including crossing the boundaries into cars, mp3 players, etc. They simply do not work and the money is thrown in the garbage to equal benefit."
1,Total Junk,These discs were not recognized at all in my CD-RW drive. Hopefully the store where I bought them will accept a return. Save yourself the aggravation and buy something else.
1,Don't let the 24X label fool you!,"It does not work at 24X. I bought these to try to use my Mt. Rainier-enabled drive that supports rewriting at 24X so I can use these CDRWs like floppies. But they do not rewrite at 24X! Searching the forums on the web will reveal that these can only write at 16X and while this may be acceptable for some people who are willing to reduce the rewrite speed to 16X and not use the UDF packet writing, if you are like me and want to use packet writing, these disks are not for you. They will just cause headaches and lots of read / write failures. I've heard Verbatim brand ultra speed CDRWs work at 24X. While they do not have the 700mb version yet, sacrificing 50mb for a working disc is acceptable in my opinion."
3,HALF R & B HALF LOOSE ROCK,"THE STANDOUT IS THE SONG PADLOCK WHICH FEATURES KEITH RICHARDS ON GUITAR AND RON WOOD ON BASS ITS ABOUT A NINE MINUTE LOOSE JAM. 2 OR 3 GOOD ROCKERS THE REST IS MAINLY JAZZY R AND B. AMERICAN RELEASE. BONNIE RAITT,STEVE JORDEN AND CHARLIE DRAYTON APPEAR."
4,Good,"Good but not as great as Aaron!Mild blues compaired to his Brother,Aaron.I have ordered another C.D. BY Aaron and I am very happy with it as always."
4,hopefull,"This book,while talking in medical terms at times, is still helpful for those trying to reach an understanding about miscarriage. It would benefit not only those parents who have experienced a miscarriage, but those in the medical community as well! Instead of the ""this thing happens"", you are given possible reasons why and some things that may stop it if possible. Bless this author for caring enough to write this informative, yet sensitive book on miscarriage!"
4,Good book but needs updated,"This book is good, but doesn't answer many of my questions. I have had 2 miscarriages and this book did give me some info on what may have gone wrong. But, it really needs updated since it was written in the early 90's. There are some more testing that can be done now that isn't mentioned."
4,Extremely informative,"After experiencing my second miscarriage, I needed some information. This book is very helpful. It covers the causes of miscarriage, testing, treatment and personal stories from women who have suffered miscarriages. After reading this book I felt hopeful and armed and ready for my next visit to the Ob-Gyn."
2,Too Out of Date to Be Truly Useful,"A lot has happened in the past 10 years in the area of recurrent miscarriage, and this book is, unfortunately, hopelessly out of date. For example, he mentions being ""immunized"" with your partner's white blood cells as a possible treatment for a specific immune problem, even though studies have shown that this treatment doesn't decrease the rate of miscarriage. If you buy this book, buy it to be read the personal stories of women who have overcome recurrent pregnancy loss, but don't rely on any of the medical information without first consulting a more up to date book, like ""Miscarriage: What Every Woman Needs to Know"" by Lesley Regan which was published in 2001. It's only available through Amazon UK, unfortunately, but is well worth the effort to get a copy."
4,Transport yourself to another world,"When I first listened to this CD I did not have much expectation. Electronic-sounding music is not my cup of tea. However, I was attracted to the artwork and the concept, so I bought it and played it one night to fall asleep to, just to see what would happen. I was quickly drawn into a receptive, altered state in which I began to ""feel"" the music. I then began to see in my mind's eye all sorts of magical and wondrous things (electric blue dolphins synchronized swimming, a UFO I was on board, and other things too difficult to put into words but equally amazing). Everytime I listen to it, I have a different experience, and while I already have some capability to have visions on my own, they are distinctly different and are very much stepped up with this CD. I believe Shapeshifter helps you through sound and vibration and imagery to realize the multi-dimensional being that you are."
1,"Move on, not worth the time.","Don't be confused by the name; there are other, and much better ""The Patriot"" films staring Mel Gibson or Steven Seagal and then there's Patriot Games staring Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan. In this 1986 movie a former Navy SEAL who was dishonorably discharged, was called back to the Navy to recover a stolen Navy nuclear weapon. It's not often that I have given less than 3 stars to a military movie; they are my favorite review. But this film, with Leslie Nielsen as its star is as poorly done as I've ever reviewed. I tried to like it; in fact I tried to watch it! No luck. If you're like me and in to military movies, the title ""The Patriot"" sound inviting, and it is if it's the one with Mel Gibson! ...This poor film of the same name is rated R for a brief sex scene and military violence. ..."
3,Cute,Cute book. I put this in my cart to make my order add up to over $25 for the super saver shipping.
5,Raised on Redbone,"I was actually raised listening to this album and ""Message from a Drum"". My mother still has both of these LP's and I was at her house today listening to them.It was a surprise to hear them again today and remember how much I loved their songs growing up. They are a great band with much more talent than I believe they were ever given credit for. Just listen to ""Message from a Drum"" as it transitions into ""niji Trance""...great lyrics and vocals!!"
2,Golden Clastics/Redbone,"I was very disappointed in this product. The C.D. must have been the original C.D. because it was not remastered at all. The sound is not very good. That is of course due to the lack of being ""updated""or ""upgraded""with regard to the sound.I also recall being impressed that the band was Native American. When I read the information about the band they knew nothing about their culture to speak of. There are much more authentic bands that are Native Americans out there now that are great. Redbone is not that impressive when it comes down to it.CCL"
1,Possibly reasonable music for travelogues and TV commercials,"I have heard this disc all week in my work place.I hope I never hear it again.The music is faux-Classical, faux-Celtic, faux-River Dance, faux-Andrew Lloyd-Webber and faux-New Age.This is an album for your Granny or anyone who is too unhip to like Pop/Rock/Dance music and unable to get into real Classical music.I like beautiful music.I like REAL Celtic & World music.I am okay with show tunes.I love Classical music.I can't stand Secret Garden."
4,Good storage items,"Definitely buy at least three of these things. I use them to store all of my different electrical items (connectors, etc...) and also my plumbing items (elbows, tees, etc...). I am a homeowner and part time handyman so these things don't see daily use from me but my plumber uses these things and swears by them. All in all a good purchase, these are much sturdier than the cheaper ones so I would recommend spending the extra money for the super stackers."
5,5 gallon organizer,"I purchased this as a gift for my father. He is always working on projects away from the house and we have to make several trips back and forth. Since having a stack of three of these units in a 5 gallon bucket, we are more organized and make less trips. I like the added touch of having holes for the screw drivers on top and that the stackers can either fit inside each other to take up less room, or turn them by 90 degrees to effectively stack them up if they are filled with items."
3,Does not fit in a standard 5 gallon bucket,It does not fit in a standard 5 gallon bucket. It is too small to fit on top but woudl work if you neded it to be on the bottom
4,wonderful designs,The designs in Basic Beadwork for Beginners are beautiful! The directions are a bit hard to follow. I am not sure that the classification of Beginners is correct. Wonderful pictures of the finished items.
4,exciting bed curler,"I had to read this book for my english class and I picked this book from the list just because it was short. Boy was I lucky, I found the book very intresting and worth reading. Throughout the novel I had the feeling that Miss Miller and Winterborne were going to bone but I like how James put the plot together."
1,Lawless passions,"This story is extremely conventional.Daisy Miller, its main character, shows 'reckless behaviour': 'Flirting with any man she could pick up; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians; dancing all the time with the same partners; receiving visit at eleven o'clock at night. Her mother goes away when visitors come.'For the American community in Europe, Daisy Miller is 'running absolutely wild'. Her behaviour is totally inadmissible and abnormal.But, no problem, morality is saved. Daisy visits the Colosseum, a nest of malaria, with her Italian friend. She dies a week later, not without leaving a message that 'she would have reciprocated one's affection', that of a solid American, who 'had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism'. Death is a well-deserved punishment for a 'POOR girl'.For Henry James, Daisy's mixture of 'audacity, puerility and innocence is inscrutable.'This moralist story can be read in all school classes studying Victorian upper class conventions."
2,this book was awful,"It was very hard to follow and it jumped aroung a lot. I really don't recommend it. But if you like boring confusion, I say go for it."
1,outdated and boring,"Daisy Miller is a novella that doesnt lead anywhere. It is outdated when speaking about a nouve riche american family that travels to Europe and tries to impose values that are not seen in our society today. I had to write a report about it in English class. Had I known it was going to be such a boring and pointless book i wouldn't have bothered to pick it up and read it. Today many teenagers have to write on this book, which most find boring and cannot realte to it. I do not recommend this book, specially to teenagers discovering American Literature."
1,Worthless,"I had to read this dreadful book to complete an essay for English class. This book is pointless, not to mention boring. Anyone who has to read this book i feel sorry for!! The book is past its time and no teeager today could even begin to relate to this sad fictional prtoagonist, Dasiy Miller. The only purpose this book serves is to waste your time. Stay away form this worthless novella, this book is a waste paper i can't belive its actually printed"
5,"A quick, interesting read","Daisy Miller is everything a woman of that era should not be: flighty, flirtatious and strong-willed. I enjoyed this novella because you so infrequently see a lead female character of that era portrayed in quite such an unflattering light. While the plot is simple there are a few twists and turns. This is an interesting, fun read."
3,Over editorialized,"My comments are not particularly about the novella itself. Penguin has managed to over editorialize this classic. The first 30 or so pages explains the book in such elaborate detail that it absoluetly ruins the actual read. However, I like the fact that James' era and uncommon references had notaions & explinations (this helps to get the full meaning), but why didn't Penguin use footnotes? It's annoying to have to flip back to an index for information that could have easily been printed at the bottom of the page. I suppose I could have ignored the notes, but even that would be distracting. Of course, this is all irrelivant to the story, but I am considering the entire experience of this book. James' lovely prose was all but ruined by Penguin's Cliff-Note-esque treatment."
4,quirky little story,"found this title on the ""rory gilmore reading challenge"" list. hadn't ever heard of it. very quirky story, very quick read. no obvious mistakes in the format (spelling errors, extra gaps between paragraphs, etc)."
2,useless,"I found Daisy insipid. She was not a liberated woman, she was an idiot. It's one thing to reject social convention, it is entirely another to reject it and then expect to be accepted by society. I'm all for non-conformity, but Daisy was a twit. I give it two stars because Henry James can write."
3,does not convey the true meaning,"I read this book without thinking too much its meaning. To me, it merely shows the culural clash of personalities between naive Americans and pensive Europeans at around the time of the First World War. As Barbara Tuchman indicated in 'The Proud Tower', it was a time of rapid and unbelievable changes.Later I read that the personality of Daisy Miller reflected that of President Woodrow Wilson who failed miserably in his attempts to build the League of Nations and to make the world safe for democracy. I am afraid that reading the book did not covey this to me ."
2,Daisy is a hooker,I had to read this for class. Daisy Miller is a two timing whore. Every time she spoke I wanted to punch her.
3,Sad story by early James,"This is an early short novel by James, where he begins to work out his obsession for comparing the psyche and the ethos of Americans and Europeans of his time. The singular thing about this one is that here the roles are inverted. Whereas in the rest of his work about this subject (which makes up the majority of his whole body of work) James contrasts the American innocence and puritanism with the Europeans' perversity and worldliness, here it is the expatriate Americans and rich Europeans, in Vevey and Rome, who are scandalized by the extroverted, sexually liberated and outrageous behavior of Daisy Miller, a young and beautiful girl whose independent and candid personality is interpreted by ""society"" as licentious and indecent, up until the sad end."
4,Civility,"I'd like to take this opportunity to defend many of your accusations that James is boring or annoying, etc. Yes, James work is not immediately fulfilling as many of us have come to expect literature to be. Some things are subtle. James themes are primarily inornate in appearance, but upon analyzing you will find his work to be complex, fascinating, and maybe even satisfying. I urge readers not to dismiss his work on a purely subjective level, it really is beautiful and moving literature.P.S. Person who was talking about Tenesee Williams...chill with the random postings eh?"
1,Cucumber using what ???,"This is horrible. This has a metalic taste, smells awful and has a bad after taste. I love making my own water with lemon, lime and cucumber, but this is not cucumber."
3,Strong Cucumber Essence,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the ""Cucumber Essence"" is very strong in this water. Much more than the hint you would find in the Cucumber water at the spas and it does have a somewhat odd chemical-type smell particularly when not served ice cold.I love cucumber so it's not terrible if I mix equal parts plain water with it. Still a strong odor, but not as bad.I probably wouldn't order this flavor again unless the Cucumber hint was greatly reduced. I have tried the Pomegranate-Orange Hint Water which was fantastic and refreshing but is apparently not sold on Amazon."
1,"Hint, Hint! Read On...","I must say, HINT water is ABSOLUTELY every wonderful thing you read about it. It is a very clean, fresh water with just enough flavor to make you want more! (I would have never dreamed I'd pay this for bottled water!) However, unless you like the idea of a liquid version of a REAL cucumber, DON'T test this one out. The other flavors I have tried, however, PERFECT!"
1,Weird tasting,"I first had cucumber water in a restaurant and fell in love with it right away. I know, I know...I can make this simple water myself. But I don't have time. I saw the bottle and grabbed it to try. It tastes weird. Is there such a thing as too much cucumber? It smells good though.Feel free to try it for yourself since everyone has their own unique tastes."
3,Very refreshing...sometimes,"I've tried several flavors of Hint water and this one is definitely the best! Serve cold and it is very refreshing. I agree with the reviewer that said this tastes like a liquid cucumber, but I think that is a good thing. The flavor is not overpowering at all and I did not notice any weird smell or chemical taste.UPDATE 1/24/12: I recently purchased more of these and the new ones did have a chemical taste. Maybe it was a bad batch? I always loved these in the past, but the most recent bottles I purchased were not good at all. They were not expired, so I am not sure what caused the bad taste, but I will most likely not purchase them again."
1,Absolutely awful,"I've tried all the other Hint flavors and love them all, but I was a little skeptical of this one based on the seriously mixed reviews. I gave in and ordered a case. It has such a strong cucumber taste, it does actually taste chemically. My boyfriend said it reminds him of fabric, he said he feels like he's drinking a couch! We're trying to get through the case just to get rid of it. He told me yesterday he tried holding his nose and downing it really fast but he just couldn't do it. If you're on the fence about giving this flavor a try, just don't do it. It's not worth it. I'm truly surprised the company would even continue making it."
3,"Hint Premium Essence Water, Cucumber","I like Hint water, but the cucumber flavor tasted flat, almost stale. I prefer the other flavors better. If it had mint added to the cucumber, that would, to me, make it better."
2,Not Very Good,"i had high expectations for this drink as i love the brand, but this one in particular is not so great. has a funky after taste and somewhat of a plastic after taste. i do not recommend, but i do recommend blackberry and watermelon :)"
1,Flavor is not good at all!,I like most of the Hint waters but this one taste really bad. Like cucumber but with an after taste..like a urinal..I don't know how else to describe it.
5,I love this knife/tool/friend.,"For me, this pocket knife has everything. I take it everywere. I needed a philips screwdriver, scissors, and a cork screw (the three tools I use most) and this knife had them all and much much more. Just add a projectile grappling hook and it could completely replace Batman's utility belt."
1,"I love it, its a Swiss army knife...just isn't worth getting all of the spam from Amazon",No question about the quality or features; and the price was right. Replaced the one that got stolen. Great tool to leave in the car. Only downside is that now I'm constantly spammed by Amazon
4,"Beware, only one shoe in package",The part is an exact replacement for my 10HP MTD snowblower. And will fit most MTD made snowblowers. The photo description lead me to believe there would be two shoes in the package and there was only one. That made it expensive. Later I took the old worn shoe to my local welder in town and he welded a replacement piece to the bottom of the old shoe that was thicker and would last longer. NO CHARGE! He even powder coated the shoe being he had other items of the same color going into the oven. I did tip the actual welder for his time. You can be sure when the season is over I will be bringing in the other shoe to be repaired.
5,A Real Standout,"Adjectives abound to describe the music on this CD: groovy lounge, funky jazz, uptempo soul - you get the point. The bottom line is the CD contains 72 minutes of quality songs in a genre (house/lounge/nuJazz) that produces a lot of mediocre music. I've found this single CD to be much more playable than many of the 2 CD collections in the bargrooves and Afterdark series. It has a nice variety of tracks without going to far in any one direction - from the smooth vocals on Give A Little and Surprise Me to the jazzy Sugar Baby Darlin and Feel the Music. A keeper and repeater."
5,Love the CD want more music and songs by Bertie.,I enjoyed this CD very much and sure would like to hear more of Bertie. Anyone who hasn't heard this CD is in for a real treat.
4,"Useful, but not detailed enough","I haven't been out on any of the rivers with this book yet, but it looks like it will be helpful. It doesn't seem to carry near the detail as the Wyoming one I have, but, still helpful."
4,Died an early death...,"I have had this icemaker for less than two years and it just gave up the ghost. My ""media room"" is on the second floor of the house and I loved the convenience of not having to run downstairs to get ice. However, I would have liked an item this expensive to last a little longer than it did. I did use it daily and perhaps it was not designed to be used continuously. I am trying to decide which icemaker to get next and have not ruled this one out, but I am a little hesitant to fork over more than $200 when there are less expensive models being offered."
3,first one didn't work and too bulky,"The first one arrived broken. The second one is working so far. However, the unit is very bulky and heavy. I wouldn't buy this unless you really are sure you want it and have a place to store it and can lift it when you need to move it."
1,piece of junk,"This is a piece of junk. The face plate was falling off when i got it, it actually looks like someone tried to pry it off somehow. There were 3 screws laying in the bottom of box, the screw holes they were suppose to be in didn't even match up and were stripped out. There is a rattling sounds like it has broken glass in it somewhere. It also leaks. It does make ice, but it melts very quickly. I was suppose to give this as a gift, but Im too embarrassed so I am sending it back for a full refund. Don't bother, just go buy a bag of ice."
1,JUNK Does not even rate one star,"JUNK IS TOO GOOD A WORD for this ice maker, nothing but problems. No service no repairs, I was told at time of purchase if I used my Amazon credit card I would have an extended 1 year warranty NOT TRUE !Have been unable to even find anyone who knows how to repair it. My fault NOT getting warranty in writting."
1,Didn't work-still waiting for an Return Authorization,I received the ice maker but it didn't work. The inside of the box looks like this was already opened and repacked as the inside packing material was damaged. It's been 1 week and I have still not have received a response to my return request. This is not a happy customer!!!!
2,"Worked great, while it worked!","Have had the unit for a little over a year. It worked great!However it recently stopped working, and the company is completely useless as far a service or support. There does not appear to be any service, support or parts available once you experience any problems. They seem to regard it as a disposable product rather than an appliance."
1,Not Made to Last!,"I've had three of these machines. The first two were from Haier. The first one stopped working during the warranty period. They gave me a hassle, but finally replaced it. The second one lasted less than two years and stopped. The NewAir is the identical machine and it has lasted 14 months. These are not cheap and they certainly should last longer than that. I give up!"
1,Worse Ice Maker Made,This is the worst made unit. The part that pushes the ice out has broken twice now. It cost significant dollars to return it for repair the first time. It was shipped back incomplete and we waited two weeks for the tray to be returned. The unit is unreliable and poorly made. Choose another brand.
2,Poor Design,"This icemaker does make cubes quickly, but then they just quickly melt and stick together. Also the cubes taste funny even after cleaning the machine."
1,"Worked great, then broke after a couple months.","This ice maker worked great a couple months, then I just used it as an expensive cooler while I purchased ice at the store.The ice shovel part has plastic joints that shatter into many small pieces. I had to disassemble everything in my ice maker and order a new part. It was very tiresome job since I had to remove about 50 screws to replace that part.Looks great, but bad investment. I'd never buy one again."
2,Mine lasted about 20hrs,20hrs of use are you kidding me the light comes on when you first plug it in then just doesn't come on after that looking to get it fixed
2,Worked for a bit... then broke.,"The Newair machine arrived in good condition and within minutes of setting it up, the machine was whirling away making ice.And for a few months, it did just that... made lots and lots of ice.Unfortunately, at the three month mark, the sliding tray inside the machine began to catch.There was no mention of it in the thin manual and attempts to reach the company and out-sourced seller fell on deaf ears.I wouldn't recommend this ice maker.It's on the low-end of the cost scale and I now know why.I wish I could recommend this machine, because it was great when it worked.But for the money, I should get more than three months use.Look elsewhere, folks."
3,"Does its job, BUT","Our new ice maker is doing what it advertised, making ice and lots of it. Problem is, the ice tastes like melting plastic. In spite of running the clean cycle several times (the instructions say once), cleaning the unit with baking soda, and leaving a box of baking soda in the unit over night, our ice still reeks and tastes of plastic. Thinking it might be our tap water, we ran Evian through it.The ice still tastes like plastic.Hopefully, this will pass over time, but buyer beware...if you want to use your ice maker immediately, think again :(. Also, the maker doesn't store ice. Not a huge problem in our case as we have an extra freezer, but just be sure you're aware of that before you hit ""buy""."
1,Disappointing Investment,"I purchased this product in September 2007. I used it on those occasions when demand for ice exceeded the capacity of my refrigerator's ice maker. The AI-210SS has, at most, 8 hours of run time on it. The unit makes one round of ice and then shuts down for ""low water level"" even though the reservoir is full. You have to shut the unit off, unplug it, plug it back in, and turn it on. Even then, it will tell you that the water level is low. After anywhere from 5 to 8 tries, the water pump will turn on, fill the freezing tray, make one round of cubes, and then shut down again for ""low water level"". No one in my area works on portable ice makers or stocks repair parts for the AI-210SS. My money would have been better spent buying a basic ""second"" refrigerator with built-in icemaker from Sears. I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product."
4,Makes Good Ice but Does not Keep it Cold,"May be it was a misunderstanding on my side, but this machine is a for making ice only. If you think of it as a mini-freezer, that will make ice and will keep it that way - don't get fooled. It is a great ice-maker, but once ice was made you have to manually remove it from the container and put it to a freezer. Ice starts to melt quite quick, so make sure to transfer it to a cold place before ice cubes start sticking to each other. It is a little noisy, but this is not a major drawback of this device.Other than that - great and fast way of making ice. If it just had an internal cooling device!"
3,"Product is good, when it works.","I purchased the NewAir AI-200SS last fall. It worked great for about 6 months at which time, it stopped making Ice. I contacted AirNWater and they gave me an RMA for it. I returned it (at my $27) and then had to pay for the replacement ($19.95). It's now 1 month that I've had the replacement and it TOO has failed to make ice. I've done everything by the book but no ice. I'm waiting on a response from AirNWater. If I have a choice, I'll just get a refund. This $209.00 Ice Maker is not into me for $265.00 and I'm not sure another $50 is worth it.It's a shame because, when it works, it was great."
1,does not perform for long,"IT SEEMS THAT THESE PORTABLE ICE MAKERS ARE NOT RELIABLE FOR MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS. IT IS AN ENGINEERING FAULT IN ALL BRANDS, INCLUDING NEWAIR PRODUCTS. WARRANTIES ARE DIFFICULT TO FULFILL SINCE RETURNING REQUIRES DIFFICULT REPACKAGING. IF YOU MUST OWN THIS PRODUCT, I WOULD BUY RETAIL, SINCE RETURNS ARE NOT SO DIFFICULT. DO NOT HAVE HIGH EXPECTATION OF THE ICE MAKER LASTING MORE THAN A YEAR, BEWARE. IT'S JUST A BAD PRODUCT."
5,excelent product for the price,"I got this product and found hard to believe all the technology behind it for making small ice cubes and for the price offer, I strongly recommend it."
4,Makes ice quickly,"The first one I received did not work, but I received a replacement in less than a week and it works great. Makes ice very quickly. Just wish it would hold more ice. I would recommend it."
5,Solves my Problem,"My new refrigerator has a smaller capacity for making and storing ice cubes. With this new portable ice machine, I no longer need to rush to the store for ice when company arrives, especially for ""pool days"""
4,Good Witch Nutcracker,"Buying online is like ""following the yellow brick road,"" you gotta have faith. This one made it home to Kansas! My wife loves it and the qualty is much higher than the price. Thank you."
3,It's Only OK,"For the price I paid ($28) it was pretty cheaply made. It's not that impressive coming out of the box. No fancy or eye catching elements. My daughter liked it but it's not great. The dress was wrinkled and wadded up. There were hot glue strings all over. The hair is just cheap fake fur. Not even nice fake fur. The nutcracker part is in the stomach, not the chin. If you're a nutcracker aficionado you should keep looking. If you just want a ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""Wicked"" nutcracker, this one is OK."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this product because I like the scent of the lavendar ZZZtherapy lotion by Healing Gardens. It is one of the few products that doesn't bother my allergies and has a scent that stays fresh and true. However, it is no longer available. I ordered this as a substitute. Don't order it expecting the same scent. This lotion has a soapy smell to it and is not light and pleasant. The scent is perfumy but not necessarily lavendar."
4,A welcome return to the absolute best of Mark Lindsay,"This CD is actually a double album comprised of Mark's two solo efforts: ""Arizona"" and ""Silver Bird"". This music has been difficult to find for the past several years and we are fortunate to have it at hand once again. These songs, particularly from ""Arizona"", bring back fond memories of high school, growing up, teenage angst, (and yes, backseats). Mark Lindsay now has an excellent career as a producer but these songs from the period between that and his days as one of ""Paul Revere and the Raiders"" are, as far as I'm concerned, some of his finest work. This is music to be enjoyed."
3,Raider gone solo,"I remember hearing these songs in 1970. Arizona, Silver Bird,and Miss America. Great songs! Yes, the rest of the cd isfilled with soft, mellow songs, unlike the hit songs on the radio.It's still a good cd to buy, even for the die-hard Paul Revere &the Raiders fans who like listening to Mark Lindsay's voice."
5,I enjoyed every second of this album-partial to Mark Lindsay,"I have always enjoyed listening to Mark Lindsay's voice, but its been years. I haven't been able to find any records in the stores. All my old records were stolen years ago. Didn't know it was still available until I visited Amazon."
4,A wonderful solo album,"That was yesteryear during my teen age when I was a great fan of Mark Lindsay, whom I not only loves his youthful appearance, but to the extent of his wonderful solo hits in this particular album, the only rare hit that is missing is a song called 'Something's big' But then I should be quite contended with this recent released album."
1,Gutless music from the 1970s,"This is the type of CD which gives the 1970s such a bad name in music- gutless, no soul, performed by a former teenybopper pop star who belongs with the Carpenters, Bread, and Sajid Khan, to name a few other no-talent ""stars""."
3,Mom of Six,"I like the look of the watch and it is comfortable to wear. However, the beads were painted and the color is already rubbing off of them. I've only had the watch a few weeks."
2,Kindle Version Hard to Read,"I love my Kindle and really enjoy the ease of downloading books. Even so, this book made me doubt the Kindle.In truth, it was not the fault of the Kindle, it had to do with whoever (or whatever) compiled this into the Kindle format. There are so many words run together that you have to slow down to decipher the individual words. Take a look at the sample (I should have). Words crammed together like MacCallisterwhen"", ""daybusiness"", ""constantlyon"" ""MacCallisterwas"", and ""settledby"" can be found in the first four paragraphs of the PROLOGUE. It doesn't get better as the book progresses and you will also find words split like ""often = of ten"". I finally gave up and called Johnstone's offices to see if a better copy was available. They sympathized with the problem and let me know this format did not come from them and there was nothing they could do."
5,eagle series,al of the eagle series books are really good reading. would suggest that a person starts at book one to the best
2,Blood of Eagles,Blood of EaglesWord spacing is terrible. Plot and story line is great as all of William W. Johnstone's books are written. Butthe spacingbetween words arevery confusing.
3,It's growin' on me,"The first listen I couldn't get past the vocal's and I just put it away. I am not to hip on jazz with vocals, but a few more listen's and the music really hit me hard, especially the rhythm section and Gary Bartz sax. Now I have this music with me wherever I go and some of the vocals are actually pretty good (like- ""Uhuru Sasa""). Harlem Bush Music is divided into (2) albums ""Taifa"" & ""Uhuru"" (both included on the CD). I really like ""Uhuru"" with Ron Carter on funky bass. It's still growing on me with every listen- who knows a little longer & it could end up in my top 10 with 5 stars."
4,Excellent outline of current horse care ideas.,"Although this book can make you feel that horses are better off unridden, I have used some of her information to make my horses' lives alittle better. Her data on saddlery, shoeing and horse dental work are items which are being reviewed today. But like everything in the horse world, new ideas for horse care (homeopathic, etc.) should be approached carefully and with experienced caretakers (as she mentions). Having said that, this author is very good at explaining the biomachanics of riding, and I feel that many of her ideas on making horses more comfortable are not far off the mark. I would recommed this book."
1,bunch of quackery,"very disappointing book. From the title, I expected something along the lines of how to adjust your horse's environment and work to get a happier, more natural result. Instead, the book more or less claims that every horse is in horrible, terrible human-produced pain, and that the only way to get rid of this pain is to suscribe to every quack remedy that comes along."
1,sewing book,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this book. It is a poorly executed edition. Granted, the original pictures were hard to copy. But, that could have been fixed, by locating a good technician with the latest enhancement software. I have better antique sewing books in my collection, so I am returning this book. Not, worth keeping."
3,Misleading cover info or can't tell a book by its cover,"Another review states that the CD DOES NOT have the demo version of Quark on it and I totally agree. I feel cheated, yes you can download the demo, but what even gripes me more is that the fonts for the lessons are not included, couldn't they have used fonts that are some of the regular Windows fonts."
3,Interesting reading,"Marek acted as an editor in the compilation of information widely available on the Internet or public sources regarding the sex slave trade. The book was easy to read and can be completed in a short period of time. Marek did a good job at outlining the scale of the problem, however stop short of discussing how the global planet should address the issue."
2,Very Dry,Surprising info but very Dry Easy to undrstand but hard to keep interest. Too many fact with not enough story to hold ya. I still haven't finished it and I believe it's been over a year since I started. ugh
3,Good to start,"When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Filled with stories and events related to the Sex trade in Europe, it drew me in from page one. The author even tells his own stories of girls hes spoken with that were forced into prostitution agianst their will. Around the middle of the book it gets boring, I actually haven't finished it. He talks about how the police and government are aware of whats going on but chose to ignore the facts and the author writes about it being a conspiracy. Its boring and repetative from here on out. But none-the-less, its a great book, it just loses its fuel quickly."
2,Boring,"Much hype about nothing. The sex trade is dead, this book glorifies this trade in hopes of selling books."
5,essential Bird,"I first heard this when I was a teenager in the 1980s, borrowed as a scratched LP from a family friend. I remember walking to the bus stop each day with Wardell Gray's solo on Lullaby in Rhythm (not ""I May Be Wrong"" as on all the listings) ringing in my head. Nearly 30 years later I got it digitally and the magic is still there in spades. It's an amazing recording, a bunch of jazz stars recorded on home-made equipment in a fairly choppy restaurant (you can hear a fight almost breaking out in the background of one track) but the quality of the music shines through the years and the smoke. Wonderful music loaded with atmosphere."
4,Embittered Brilliance,"Having read the entire collection from cover to cover, I would have to say that there is much to interest the student of poetry. ""The Great Hunger"" is a very powerful early work. In some ways, I think that Kavanagh the poet lived in the shadow of that one achievement. Did Kavanagh rise to his potential? He might say that he did not. Was he too caught up in the image of being a poet? I think not. Did he put too many hopes in poetry as a means of financial salvation? Perhaps. However, whatever else Kavanagh's work is, it is REAL. The world he writes about is real. The cultures of ivory tower and religion that he often rails against are not as real as life is for the average person. This is the work's strongest suit. I would say this collection is more than worth a tour, but be prepared for much bitterness--and, to be fair, some occasional light hearted frivolity--and have a pint of Guiness after."
3,AI CANDY,"SEXY PIRATES is the further adventures of the adorable Time Traveller Ai Ijima.This time, instead of the past, she takes us to the future...2,000 years to be exact. Not to worry: They have bikinis in the future, too! Once in the far-flung future, Ai and her wacky sidekicks meet up with her future counterpart, however, this future Ai isn't quite as fun-loving. SEXY PIRATES is pretty rambunctuous throughout, although there's not quite as many bouncing boobs as in Book 1.Regardless, this is a very fun title and a quick read. No heavy sub-plots or characterization here. It's just one joke after another, and all in good fun. Check this one out."
5,"history, friendship, tolerance",this book captured my audience of 4th graders with a little background filling of segregation. Wonderful story!
1,Not what the box says it is,"I had this movie given to me, and have to admit, I am glad that I did not pay money for it.The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this movie is far from that.In reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at all.Even movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and suspense.But Jaded has none of this. It concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.While it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.If at all possible, pass this movie up at all costs."
4,Its really sad but really good,i loved this movie. I thought some of it was so heartbraking but the other part of it was amazing. I loved this movie. I say this is a must see.
3,Not as good as I expected...,"I mean, look at the cover on the box! This one looks like an erotic thriller, right? Even the slogan, ""not every sexual predator is a man"" sounds to be like what SHOULD have been a very erotic video of a gorgeous babe being trapped by a couple of other hot women who use & abuse her, right? I was thinking ""WOO-HOO! ""... but, the actual experience didn't live up to expectations. This one was more like a crime drama with very little erotic video. The girl-girl action actually shown was very brief and not even very hot. If it was advertised as such I doubt I'd have even bothered to rent it. As is, I'm both sadder & wiser..."
2,The Aftermath of Rape,"A strange movie about a particularly horrific rape, JADED unnecessarily plays up the male-oriented eroticism associated to rape and voyeurism as the woman's victimization is show progressively over a series of disjointed flashbacks. Interestingly enough, the rapist(s) and victim are both female, also feeding into another series of male fantasies. The conclusion is rather forced and, sadly, unclear ... leaving the viewer wondering about the true consequences against those who perpetrated the deed. Certain scenes, particularly of the rape sequence, are not for the light-hearted."
2,Jaded not very good,"Movie was not what thought it was, not very good movie acting was not great, plot was bad, hot girls though"
3,"Love it or hate it, it's fun at least","So, this movie.... if there was one thing i brought from it was Brinke Stevens about half way thru changes into a really hot dominatrix outfit @_@ It is a fun little movie, by no means take it as even possibly serious. The comedy is rather dated, but it is a nice throw back to mid 80's cheez. So, if you want to see Brinke lookin all hot without nudity (though there is some)and up for some supernatural cheese with an 80's flair - go for it!"
2,So Romantic!,I really feel stupid about ordering this book. Why did i do it?. The story is that Stacey is moving Back to New york.
5,REVENGE SEASON 1 -,WOW! STILL WORKING ON VIEWING BUT QUITE DRAMATIC. A TWIST A TURN EVERY EPISODE. AMANDA HAS A PLAN FOR ALL CARACATERS INVOLVED.
1,did not download,I could not even rate this show appropriately since it did not download. I just wasted my money for nothing.
5,Yum!,Revenge is the best show on TV and it's still going. I wont put any spoilers in this review but the pilot is not how it plays out to be. I love this show and I follow it almost religiously. Everyone should watch this amazing show!
5,Just when you thought you had it figured out...,"This show is now my favorite drama of all time!! My friend suggested it, and I'm so glad she did! The drama keeps you guessing, and wanting more. The characters work great together, and they throw in some light humor every now and then. A MUST WATCH if you like drama!"
5,Love it,"We got this because it's a very interesting series; Never had problems viewing the chapters...takes a while to download, but it worth it."
3,BELT TO SMALL FOR HOLDER,"THE BELT THAT COMES WITH THE HOLSTER IS GOOD FOR A 27"" WAIST AND NOW I WILL HAVE TO BUY A NEW BELT A MAN CAN WEAR WHITCH WILL COST"
4,"Wacky, inventive, if scattershot early Altman","Completely off the wall, absurdist story of young man who wants to fly, and the women in his life, wrapped into a murder mystery.It's almost Monty Python-like at times in it's bizarre surreal humor. There are some great moments and scenes, even if it doesn't add up to a lot, and some of the humor is repetitive or juvenile (endless bird-poop jokes), and there are lots of unanswered questions and holes. Still, in it's weirdness one could argue it's more cohesive and truly, deeply subversive than MASH."
2,Robert Altman at his weirdest,"This film is evocative of the quirky, madcap Robert Altman at his best and worst. We got it because we have a Bud Cort fan in the family, and just to see him makes it worth it. But the story is strange, resolution less than satisfying. If you're really a big Altman or Cort fan, then you must see it. Just be aware that THIS IS NOT A WESTERN! (I had it confused with John Wayne's ""Rooster Cogburn"" and the Dennis Weaver's ""McCloud"" and kept waiting for it to start, thinking I was seeing more previews.) The storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the Astrodome who is trying to fly, with a murder mystery and detective story. This is one of Shelly Duvall's early roles -- don't miss her upside-down false eyelashes!"
1,Compleatly forgettable,I paid good cash to see this movie when it was released and in the movie theaters even. What a downer after such a great movie MASH. This movie is a total waste of time and completely forgettable. Course I was totally wasted when I saw it.
5,this one flies high above ordinary films- my favorite movie,"It is a shame that this movie gets less attention on the Internet than any other terrible piece of film they put a web site about these days. This is hilarious to say the least. Even from the starting point, I found myself laughing (watch for the MGM lion in the opening sequence). Margaret Hamilton adds to the laughs as she re-portrays her Wicked Witch role. The person who gave this a one star rating at the bottom either didn't get what it was about or the film didn't fit his taste. Bud Cort gives his best performance (another being Harold Chasen in ""Harold and Maude"") Don't miss this one. If you find you have difficulty laughing or if you loved ""Brazil"", ""Harold and Maude"", or ""M*A*S*H"", this is definitely for you. It does have several similarities to the Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil""."
3,More like a hair dryer but it works,"I was expecting something bigger, but what the heck - it is tiny. Looks like a hairdryer. It is made by some no name Chinese manufacturer and the smell of the plastic is awful - just like what you smell when in a Dollar Store. There is a bag for suction but it's tiny so I guess it's useless.I used it to clean my garage and blow out leaves and get spider webs on the ceiling. For that it works very well because of its light weight and sufficient power. For outdoor you can only expect to push around a small pile of leaves.So overall I'm happy with it because it works, but it is not worth more than the low price I paid because it really is a product of cheap Chinese junk manufacturing."
3,(Understandably) Low end pressure from VERY cheap mini blower,This product was dirt cheap (<$15) so expectations were not high.It _barely_ has enough push to blow the dust out of the gaps between the blades of my big CPU heat spreader ... that's really all I'm looking for and it basically works... just a little more oomph would've been nice... but you can't have too much or you'll damage those relatively delicate cooling fans so this will do.
1,worth 12$,This worth 12$ not more. The 3/4hp does't output 200mph. The ouput is not more than an hair dryer and very cheap.
4,sniff sniff,this is quite simply one of the most heart-wrenchingly sad songs that I have heard in a long time. the depth of which is only accentuated by Eddie Veder's raspy voice. love it. buy it. listen.
5,Excellent,This is a haunting rendition of this song. I play it several times a week and it never loses its appeal. Excellent!
2,interesting,"It doesnt sound like Pearl Jam, because it isnt Pearl Jam. It was done back in the 50s or 60s by Frank Wilson and then Gil Deanda, who is responsible for making it the most famous. This song is not one of Pearl Jams newest creations, as so many people continually refer to it."
5,angelita from south korea,this cd single was dedicated to the situation of u.s. soldiers in bosnia. i've been looking for this a long time ago. this song is people-person.
3,fabulous,I never really like Pearl Jam at all not until I heard his Last Kiss.It's simplicity and rhythm makes it great.
5,Excellent new song from Pearl Jam,"This song takes you back to the 60's. Eddie Vedder shows a new side of his voice in this ""oldie-goldie"". This song is not what you would call a typical Pearl Jam song, but it is really good! You are bound to like it!"
5,The best of the best songs I have every heard.,I went to a really good friend of mines funeral. He shot himself. He would always listen to this song. At his funeral they played this song. That is when i started to listen to it. Every time I hear the song I start to cry because i think of him.
3,Good Song but isnt Pearl Jam,"This is an excellent remake, very good song... I have the single and WANT THE ALBUM... However, the down side is that this ISNT Pearl Jam. If you are a fan of them, you will agree. What ever happened to songs like Ten and Jeremy, Once, Even Flow, Alive??? This WAS Pearl Jam... First Metallica sells out for the mighty dollar now looks like Corporate America has gotten to Pearl Jam too... all you fans out there send email to Pearl Jame man, tell them to stick to the heart and the blood of Pearl Jam... dont sell out like this!!!"
5,What a good CD!!!!,"This cd is the best!!The lyrics are very good and the song is better!!In fact,this songs make me wanna sing,dance,smile and cry at the same time. They are very very good!!They've got a lot of different feelings at the same time...it's difficult to explain!!"
1,Boring !,"When i first heard this song, I thought WHAT A BORING SONG !, i almost went into shock when the guy on the radio said it was pearl Jam, Eddie sound 10 times better screaming ! . I only forgive the guys because they did this song for a good cause ( charity )"
2,"Pearl Jam, So Generous.","After reading most of the reviews on this page i begun to realize no one realy knows anything about this song. No, this is not the new Pearl jam, and yes it is a cover song. Eddie was looking through some old records,he came accross the song, and the band covered it for the Ten fan club. Later they donated it to the Kosovo refuges album(along with the b side Soldier of Love).I think they covered it well, but im just not into 50's music. It has excellent lyrics, but realy simple beats.ps. and all u making fun of my spelling(excuse my spelling), i know where u live."
2,why so popular all of a sudden,"How come all of a sudden this song is so popular? I have listened to the original since I was a baby, and it is my favorite song. I can't believe people think that Pearl Jam made the song. They did not. By the way, the original is a lot more sincere than the one by Pearl Jam."
3,the b-side is better,"it amazes me that a soundcheck of a cover song could become so popular. i first heard this song last summer during the tour through tape trading and then on the fan club's holiday single. some DJ in minnesota or something started playing it and it just blew up into #2 on the billboard charts. i never really liked it, but apparently it strikes a chord with some people. but anyway, please don't think this is new pearl jam, cause its not. and its not anything like their usual stuff. at least soldier of love is good, but they don't play that on the top 40 stations, thank goodness!"
1,This Is Pearl Jam??????????,This song is the pits!It doesn't even sound like Pearl Jam 1-bit.I hope this doesn't mean they're selling out.I miss the old Pearl Jam.
3,this aint the real pearl jam,"ok, ok. it's a nice song. it's inspired hundreds of teenage girls to scream ""oh i love pearl jam, that song 'last kiss' is sooo great""if you love this song, you will not likely love pearl jam. i'm not writing this to criticise those who like it, i'm just saying i'm sick of the bandwagon effect this song has created. that it is the only pearl jam song to go #1 in Australia is a crime. 'last kiss' would have had trouble making it on to any of pearl jam's six studio CD's.so, if you want to hear the true pearl jam, try the angst of ""Ten"" and ""Vs."", the experimentation that was ""Vitalogy"", the rock of ""Yield"", and their best two works, ""No Code"" and ""Binaural"". Only then will you understand where i am coming from."
5,It's pure P.J. what more can be said.,"Pearl Jam has changed over the years, but as far as I am concerned it has been for the better. Music groups that stay the same and try to bleed the american dollar for all that it is worth by giving the public the same old crap that they gave them before, are really getting old. Here is a group that keeps coming out with albums and changes and enlights us. It is great to have real artist in the buisness. This single is just an example of their pure ability to change and to give us great music."
3,Sad but awsome,Pearl Jams last kiss is much better than the oringinal.The old one was to fast and sad songs like this one should be slow.
5,"incredible, a real buy","The first time i heard Last Kiss I thought it had a good beat and had to have it. Then I heard the lyrics and it was so sad, which just made the song even better. Eddie Veder has a great voice and no one could have gone it better then Perl Jam"
5,the best,"When My mom and I were in the car, Last Kiss came on the radio. I said , Mom! Listen to this song, I love it! She sung the whole song. I'm like How do you know this? She said Jay Frank Wilson sung that song, and when she was 13(my age) it was her favorite song:)"
5,I think that PEARL JAM'S song last kiss is a very good song,The first time that I heard First Kiss by PEARL JAM was when I was driving to my girlfriends house. The song got me thinking alot about finding the right girl is very important.Then later Igot thinking that I HAVE found the right girl for me and how much she means to me.
3,I loved it!!,"I loved the song ""Last Kiss"". It was wonderful. Except for the end when he starts that humming part. To me it sounds a little off key compared to the real song."
3,Good source for the Latin,"It is helpful to have an inexpensive edition of the Latin Meditations. The painfully literal English ""translation"" that accompanies it in this volume may serve as a handy vocabulary crib, but by itself is unreadable-- although generally reliable. Curiously, even the translator's own introduction does not reveal a more comfortable writing style: sentences grow into paragraphs, and paragraphs swell into pages. Parenthetical expressions are occasionally embedded three-deep, and the subject matter vacillates between textual trivia and attempts at profundity.Unusable as an undergraduate text, but thanks for the Latin!"
2,Be careful!,"Be Careful! This is NOT the translation described in the Amazon reviews. It is a the unreadable one by Heffernan. This edition is useful only for its Latin text. The facing English can be used as an aid to the reader, but is often so stiff and convoluted as to be unreadable as English. The fifty-page introduction is full of trivia and misinterpretations. The volume is quite justifiably out of print!"

2,"Good headset, but...","I use this headset with my Windows 7 PC and my Blackberry BOLD 9700. The device works fine on the PC, but on the blackberry, communication is somewhat choppy. Another little annoyance is that when playing video on the BB, the headset cuts on and off for some reason. Audio seems to work fine, although the quality is not as good as with the corded earphones."
3,"Somewhat happy, but.....","This is my first Bluetooth device which I'm using to listen to streaming audio via my HP dv6000z laptop. I was tired of headsets with easily broken cords. The GE 99002 was fairly easy to set up, although I was confused about the instructions saying to charge the battery for a ""minimum"" of 12 hours when it only took 1.5 hours to fully charge. In my house, I can listen to the audio from the same floor where my laptop stis, or in the room directly above. A temporary annoyance was trying to figure out how to put the device on my head so that the ear pieces would rest somewhere near my ears. The instructions don't have any pictures showing how to wear the device properly. I actually figured it out while writing this review. I haven't been able to get the volume controls to work ... so have to rely on the laptop volume mixer."
5,The Kirov Ballet At It's Best!,"This was worth every penny!! There was nothing bad to say about it. The costumes were tremendous, the scenery was extremely elegant, tasteful, and realistic, and the dancing was beyond great; it was terrific!!! There were so many great additions too. At the beginning and end, the Corsaire sails on a real ship with great waves, and the lighting on the stage looks very much like sand. This is a must-have for everyone, and you won't regret it if you buy it."
5,AB FAB Series 2,"I had all the AB FAB SERIES on VHS tapes; and watched them many times; gave the VHS tapes to a friend who has the Dual VHS/DVD player for them to enjoy; I now have the whole series of Pats & Edie in DVDs; not a fan of French, so did not purchase those DVDs."
1,dissapointed and ripped off,I did not receive this product and i complained about it and they didnt respond to me i was ripped of for 14.99 and if 1499 is something you feel like freely giving away then this vendor is for you .....his name was glenscolen
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"What else can you say? The title says it all. Everything you want to say to someone else, and, in my case probably have. I just love them. I can see myself and a friend in these real life roles. Fantastic!"
2,Too Confusing To Follow,"The author definitely knows his stuff but does a horrible job relaying it to the reader. He often has you follow steps for creating part of your website and abruptly ends with no final results and suddenly starts a new topic.This book has some good elements for a reference book, but if you're new to web design and looking for a set-by-step book to build a site in Photoshop and Dreamweaver - this is not the book you want."
1,Disappointing,"This book should be taken out of print if it hasn't already, it has some useful points but is sooo outdated that it might as well be used as a door stop because the information is much too old and based on much older versions of the software which has evolved beyond the book.Either update the book, which may have been relevant when first published, or do buyers a favor and upload the stock to the second hand books market."
1,The worst book i've ever read,"I've never read such a poorly written book. First of all, the author spelled names wrong! Marta's sister was supposed to be Mariam, not Miriam as spelled on page 114 of the book. The language was too juvenile and there were practically no imagery in the book. Things needed to be described weren't, and useless things which needed no description were described. The symbolism was confusing, the book was too short, and it should be written in a 1st person past tense form because it will be more effective. The book should be narrated by the anorexic girl herself, not the narrator. The 'dates' served no purpose and sometimes they weren't dates they may be names and such. The book was just BAD if you don't believe me go read it yourself."
3,Ram Jam - 'Golden Classics' (Collectables),"Thank goodness for the internet, is all I have to say. I MAY have not otherwise ever found all the info I need to know about Ram Jam. Was it just me or did any of you ever 'always' assume their sole hit ""Black Betty"" was a Black Oak Arkansas song? Anyway, most of these eleven tracks appear to be off their self-titled 1977 debut album. They had a follow-up after that, 'Portrait Of The Artist' in 1978, then I guess they simply called it a day. Tunes here that I liked best are the previously mentioned ""Black Betty"", ""Let It All Hang Out"", ""404"" and the jamming ""Hey Boogie Woman"". Basically, just all around decent '70's hard rock. Nothing special, but okay. Line-up: Myke Scavone - vocals, former Lemon Pipers member Bill Barlett - guitar, Howard Blauvelt (R.I.P.) - bass and Pete Charles - drums. Might appeal to fans of Foghat, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Black Oak and maybe The Sweet."
3,black betty one hit wonder,Black Betty is a song probally everyone has heard in the 70's but nobody knows its name or who sung it. Its definately a one hit wonder. It might be worth checking out the rest of the album just for that.
4,Good Product and price,Worked well out of the box. I am quite satisfied with the price and performance. There were no problems with the hook up and I would recommend to a friend.
3,Initially Really Good. Ultimately Not Too Good.,"I've had two of these. Initially both worked great, but after a year the output jacks started to fail on the unit I use the most. Despite all sorts of fiddling with the plug contact, stereo output from speaker and headphone jacks became touch and go. I popped the unit open before throwing it out and found the flimsiest little plastic jacks I've ever seen.I only need a speaker/headset switch, so as a replacement I ordered thePlantronics PC Headset Speaker Switch. I'm initially impressed with rugged build of the Plantronics, particularly the rocker switch. The sound quality is comparably clean. We'll see if the jacks are any better in the long run. They're plastic as well but more substantial, like those on notebook computers. I've never had one of those jacks fail. We'll see."
3,Excellent product for the price,"I have bought two of these and they are both working perfectly so far. The volume control on the switch works better than the volume knob on my cheap speakers. It is super convenient to be able to switch between the headset and speakers and the push of a button with out having to plug and unplug wires. For the functionality and the price I couldn't find a better deal for a product to do what I wanted.UPDATE: Had to come back and lower my review from 5 stars to 3. I purchased 2, on one the volume knob cut out six months in. The other is still going."
2,Doesn't do what I thought..,"I was hoping to use this to hook up a PS3 and my computer to the same speakers. If this is what you plan, do not purchase. The speakers make a loud humming noise with the two systems are plugged in. I am not sure if it will work better with speakers and headphones, but I did not buy it for that purpose.Also note, the velcro it comes with for mounting just doesn't stick. The glue is inferior."
3,speaker switch,works as described but my boss said my voice sounded muffled thorough the microphone switch.Rather than return the product I plugged the microphone directly into computer and did not use the microphone through the switch.Since my cable for the microphone is short you have to have the switch close to the microphone /speaker jack of the computer.Since this was ok with me in my setup because otherwise switch kept falling on floor it works ok for my use.
5,Speaker/Headset Audio Switch,"Did exactly what I needed! Easily switches between my headphones and computer speakers. As an added bonus, it comes with a volume control!"
1,You get what you pay for--actually less,"I shop amazon VERY frequently and never got a product that was such a disappointment. Worked a few days and stopped. Headphone jack works but now the computer speakers don't. It would cost as much to ship back for a replacement so why throw good money after bad? Really, avoid this one if you possible can."
5,Very useful switch.,"When you don't want to disturb people in the same room, this is the answer. It also gives you a choice of privacy. The price was right and it works great!"
5,Simple and Fantastic,"Easily allows the user to switch between a Headset/Mic to Speakers, or any combination therein. One button cycles speakers/headphones, the other controls mic on/off.Has a little square of double sided velcro tape to attach it to a surface (mine did, at least)"
5,Makes life easier,Great product it is a simple idea but it makes switching from powerful speakers to headphones at a touch. Perfectly suited in a dorm setting.
3,Cheap but works for a while,"I ordered one of these about 2 years ago on amazon. It worked great when it was new. Recently the headphone/speaker button stopped working. Sometimes when it's pressed only one channel comes though or neither. I put a good amount of daily use on it and it seems like I just wore the button out. Despite that, I'm ordering another one not because this is necessarily a good product but because it's the best one on the market. Unfortunately that's not saying much.I agree with some reviewers the buttons could be more informative about whether they're up or down. However, compared to the competition, this is small and cheap. You get what you pay for with this. It could be much better and maybe one day a better one with the same features and compactness will come along.Bottom line: It's cheap but works and will probably die on you after a few years but it's the most compact, feature-rich basic headphone/speaker switch on the market; it could certainly be much better."
4,Smaller than you think,"I was in the market to replace a Plantronics A/B switch. As I was searching Amazon I found this little item. LITTLE ITEM!!! it's approx 2.5"" x 1"" x .5"" Teeny Tiny, Itty Bitty. BUT!!! It works flawlessly for what I needed."
4,Looks and feels cheap but.....,....it's actually a nice little item and cheaper and more practical than other solutions. Been using mine for a year. Not heavy use but enough to know it's pretty durable. And it has a nice long cord to plug into your audio source.
2,Headphone volume too low,The volume from the headphone jack was too low. I had to turn the computer volume to full and then it was still not loud enough for me.
1,Don't waste your money,"I seldom write a review like this one, but trust me when I say this was a total waste. This is not only a waste of money it's a waste of plastic. The switches don't lock, you usualy tell when they are in the down position,and the pin sockets are so weak that they drop the connection. It wasn't worth the price of shipping or I would have sent it back instead of tossing it."
5,Feels cheap but does the trick,The wires are long enough and sturdy but the casing itself seems like flimsy plastic. It does everything it says and works perfectly.
5,Working as advertised,Great price and it is doing the job very well. Stereo sound for both headset and speaker. It is a very small size and didn't expect that. I like this product and I am satisfy with it's function.
4,Complete survey,"This book contains all the output of Piranesi, which is what accounts for its thickness. The display is almost purely visual, with only the most minimal of text. The illustrations are clear but fairly small for the most part. I use the book all the time in identifying Piranesis, and I suppose that any serious collector will want to own it. But for any further purpose it's not useful. The index, unfortunately, is totally inadequate and hard to use. The source of this problem (and it is a major one) is that the book is aiming for a readership that also includes Italian, French, and German readers, which means that text has to be minimal."
2,Bring your magnifying glass.,"Because you'll be looking at the equivalent of large postage stamps. Truly, a ridiculous book that will make you extremely frustrated; there is no way to appreciate the line or entirety of Piranesi's work with these miniature ""reproductions""."
4,PIranesi - the Etchings,"A startlingly inexpensive volume even at cover price, and a fine overview of the architectural visions of this singular illustrator. The size of the pages don't allow for the fullest, most detailed reproductions of the etchings, but for what is possible the quality is very good."
1,Kingmaker's Sword,"I hope you will excuse me for my English, I don't speak it very well (nor write it!). My suggestion is: don't buy this book!It is not worth the expense. I think this is almost the worst fantasy book I've ever read (and the following ones are just the same). It is boring, the characters are really poorly developed, but above all, if you go through the whole series, you'll realize they are ALWAYS THE SAME! The men are always big and strong, the women brave and with a saucy tongue... I cannot distinguish them one from the other. So if you like soft readings and replicants, this is the item for you!"
4,A Classic,"Even the cover calls to mind one of those fuzzy yet pleasantly warm fantasy stories read/or told as a child. This book is a short fantasy novel, not really all that remarkable until the cover is opened, and the characters are embraced. Once this occurs though, it is almost impossible to put this book down. There is romance, tragedy, a lost heir, courage, and indescribable evil. All the ingrediants that characterize a good fantasy book.You will see this book, and the cover might not grab your attention at first, and maybe the description won't pique your interest, but believe me, open this book and magic happens."
2,Cliched & Hackney,"Nothing original, along with poor writing and character development. Too bad, because it could have been so much better. Save your money and your time."
4,"3 E's= Exciting, emotional, enthralling",I found Kingmaker's Sword to be one of the best books I've read in quite a while. It grabbed my attention from the first page & held onto it thru the last. The book made me laugh & cry. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy & am looking forward to finishing up the series.
3,An average story,"This book is pretty predictable, there aren't any big secrets or surprises. It starts with a boy, Mouse, trying to get revenge for a woman he loved that was killed. He runs from his slavedom and is saved by a man named Cullin. Cullin re-names him Kain and he finds he has a family.Meeting a girl from his past that he has helped seven years in the future finds him searching for a lost prince. He is still out for revenge, even though he has gotten over Rossah's death.The story is one that keeps you reading but is not one you'll remember a year from now. It's okay but you can read half the book and basically know the rest, only to forget it in a week."
2,"Flashy Name, Boring Book","The main reason I purchase this book is because I am the HUGEST college football fan. I thought the name sounded pretty catchy and was interested to check it out.When I finally got around to reading it, I found out that it was basically some guy telling stories about his growing up and going to Marshall to play football. He wasn't even a very good football player and the book got it's title from a conversation with one of his coaches after they crossed paths years after he graduated form Marshall. He tells so many boring stories about him and his friends growing up together. If this book can get published, then so could any book by anyone who ever played college football."
5,High Quality,This set of bits is like no other because each bit is coated and very high quality. They last and last where the cheap bits wear out fast. The case is especially nice and has a belt clip on the back. There is also a quick dissconnect bit that fits in your drill so you can change bits in a couple of seconds. They work in the Autoloader screwdriver which is a really innovative screwdriver.Franklin Tool Co Inc AL03US Autoloading Multi-Bit Screwdriver
3,wartime memories,Interesting to come back to the WWII years through memories of a pilot whose airplane was discovered in the sea of my childrood summers.
5,Best Lavender salts on the market,"I grow lavender, and while I do make my own bath salts, mine are not nearly as strong, long lasting and pleasant as these. This soak is my go-to mix for lovely aroma in a warm bath. I am never sorry when I get this stuff. Packaged well."
5,Amazing pianist/singer/songwriter,"I cannot believe this artist isn't an enormous star. She is giften three-times over - her piano playing is staggeringly competent, her songs are consistently catchy and touching, and her voice is sweet. This CD has great songs from her first two albums. The actual hit, Thunder and Lightning, is far from her best. Wheel of Live and Myself To You are dramatic, full-throttle piano-driven ballads. Go Like Elijah is jubilant gospel. I cannot recommend this enough to anyone who likes Laura Nyro, Melissa Manchester, Carly Simon. Chi Coltrane is music of peerless beauty."
4,Great 70's Singer/Songwriter Ready to be Rediscovered,"As a teenager back in 1972, I was mad about Chi's hit single, ""Thunder and Lightning"", which I played to death. But other then the flip side of the 45, ""Go Like Elijah"", I had never heard any other of her music, so discovering this disc was a great surprise. Chi Coltrane should have made it BIG. She's as talented as many of her contemporaries who did make it big, such as Carole King and Carly Simon, and why she didn't will remain one of the big mysteries of the 1970's. Her powerfull vocals soar above her beautiful piano-driven ballads, and the gospel-tinged rockers will have you dancing around your living room. If you like women artists, this cd will not disappoint, and will be a welcome addition to your collection. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Seller!! Arrived Exactly as described!!,Extremely pleased with the fast and efficient service.
2,Pulley Seems To Be Losing Its Lubrication After Just A Few Weeks.,"I am disappointed with this Dayco pulley. While replacing the idler pulley in my BMW 323I, I noticed the lubrication coming out of the bearing. My other pulleys are made by Gates. They are working just fine. I think I will use OEM or Gates in the future."
3,Nice shirt and printing but terrible stitching!,For $7 this wasn't a bad deal. But the first time I put it on I noticed a thread hanging out on the top of the sleeve. I pulled at it and the whole shoulder stitching started to unravel. Then I realized that the stitching on the top of the shirt (that joins shoulders) is not well done. It was looped and messy and about to unravel. It may just have been a quality issue with my T shirt but it is the first time I've bought a TShirt with such sub-standard stitching.
1,This is not 3-D at all,"If you are interested in a silly DTV movie with lots of naked girls (including Julie Strain), by all means this won't disappoint. However, if you are intrigued by the 3-D idea then forget this one. Not one second was actually shot in stereoscopic 3-D at all. What the makers have TRIED to do is exploit something called The Pulfrich Illusion. This technique can give the impression of depth in a flat movie if the camera and background move in different directions. This has been tried, usually without success, in Super Bowl half times, music videos, cartoons, even sitcoms. They did not understand how to do do it and even with the glasses on there is very little if any depth to be seen, and certainly not anything which should be advertised as being ""in 3-D"". Shoot out the passanger window of a car moving at 25 MPH and then watch the video with the glasses and you will see more of the pulfrich effect than you will in 13 EROTIC GHOSTS."
2,Pure Kraft Cheez,"After watching this flick, I am left wondering: What script did these people reject?? Some films are so bad they're good. Other films are just bad. In it's favor, Julia Roberts is not in it."
2,bad choice,"The movie was ok, but not what I expected at all. just a ok b-movie without all that nudity u see in most b-movie's"
5,Work Great,They function as intended. I sleeved them black in and used them to install some fans. So far they have been working fine.
4,Wildflower is a GREAT Song...,"Wildflower is reason alone to get this CD...the soul-rock groove and the melancholy lyrics are unforgettable. About the only other song I can think of off the top of my head that gets me like this is Into the Night, by Benny Mardones."
1,Please avoid it,"I swear I cannot recall a more boring ""adventure"" movie in my whole life. In spite of the ""cool"" actors, the tropical set, the intrigues about pirates and treasures the movie is ""the"" perfect sleeping pill. There is not a single exciting, adventurous or romantic minute in the whole length of it. It makes one feel uncomfortable to see Donald Sutherland trying to navigate this rubbish nonsense. Unless you really desperately need a cure for imsomnia, avoid it at all costs."
1,Low Quality Service Is Not Ready,"I'm sure the movie is fine, we didn't watch it. This was our second experience using the unbox service and our HD TiVo. In both cases, the video was 480i. This movie showed in both letterbox and panels, that is, a black frame around all sides of the movie on our HD tv! If there are options to download HD quality video through this service, they aren't obvious. If you are using standard def equipment, enjoy, if you have HD, rent a DVD until the service is ready."
4,Fun and Worth the Watch,"I had my doubts about Fool's Gold, looking at the TV promotions...but my husband and I needed a movie-fix for the weekend, so I decided to give it a try...and discovered that it was fun, with predictable excitement, but definitely worth your time to watch. Enjoy..."
3,Entertaining while unrealistic... SPOILER...,"I found the scenery great and, being a long time Donald Sutherland fan, I was more than pleased with the cast. What I didn't find believable were the blowhole scenes and the idea ANYONE could wear scuba gear and swim to the surface while holding a box full of gold and jewelry.SPOILER AHEAD....The treasure was eventually found on the island... thus making it the property of the island owner. The movie completely ignored this..."
3,More Like Fool's Bronze,"Finn (Matthew McConaughey) is a treasure hunter and goofball who believes he has found the location to a hidden treasure. His now ex wife Tess, (Kate Hudson) is a historian who believes that Finn has no real proof of the treasures existence. Mere coincidence lands them both on millionaire Nigel Honeycutt's (Donald Sutherland) yacht. After some explaining to Honeycutt, the duo decide to seek out the treasure and are in a race against time to find it before their enemies do.""Fool's Gold"" is a mildly entertaining movie. It has something for everyone: some comedy, action/adventure, romance, and for the ladies, Matthew McConaughey shirtless. Though a romantic comedy the action scenes are pretty decent, especially towards the end. Some will get a kick out of this movie and some won't. My advice, go rent it."
1,fools purchase,"I bought this movie because I liked how to lose a guy in ten days. There is no chemistry between them, just Matt showing off his body. This is in my top ten worst films. Long, boring, & painful to get through. The only good thing is the blu ray quality!"
1,Just Plain Bad,"I usually adore the light-hearted romantic comedies that most others dismiss as ""fluff"" and ""predictable."" This movie sorely disappointed even my mediocre expectations. It was Just. Plain. Bad. The writing, the dialogue, the acting, the editing, etc., etc. The only thing halfway redeeming was the scenery, and even that didn't keep me from walking away 1/2 way through. Ugh. This ranks up there as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's too bad, because MM and KH have fantastic chemistry. I don't know enough about movies to know what went wrong with this film, but went wrong it definitely did. If you're looking for an easy, light-hearted rental on a weekend night -- skip this one."
5,Good movie,this was a good movie. I'm glad I bought it.Mat (can't spell his last name) is one of my fave actors.
5,A Good Treasure Hunt,"I had seen this movie several times before I purchased it. I couldn't get enough of it, so I bought it. The movie has a little bit of everything in it, and I love storylines about treasure hunting. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey are so good together, and the rest of the cast, especially Donald Sutherland and Alexis Dziena, who plays Gemma, his daughter, were perfect for their parts. I highly recommend this DVD for an evening of good entertainment."
4,Fun times!,"So...not an award winning film but fun and entertaining. The scenery alone is worth watching. The actors have a great chemistry and the treasure hunt isn't bad. Overall it's just a good, fun, flick."
2,As exciting as watching white paint dry on a white wall while listening to corn growing,"There are a certain number of events you can count on in any McConaughey movie. Among these are:- his shirt will be off for at least 60% of the movie- he'll be the rebellious, troublemaker to balance the determined, downto earth female lead- the ""action"" will be less than spectacular- humor is mild and watered down to the point that you'll wonder ifthey're even attempting to make you laugh- he'll take his shirt off at the most inappropriate times... wait did Ido this one already?Anyways, ""Fool's Gold"" is a mediocre at best action / ""comedy"" with a big cast that largely fails to deliver. Formulaic and uninteresting, the movie might be watchable on a dull sunday afternoon if shown on TV, but I would stay away from buying or renting the DVD."
1,I did not like this movie!,"I had low expectations for this movie in the first place, (A friend chose it). I do like both actors, but Mathew's tan body was not enough to keep me interested for an hour and a half. boring and predictable."
3,Fluffy romp--should be watched in the winter,"Admittedly, this is a contrived, predictable mystery, but that proves to be the focus rather than the romantic comedy that was promoted. But in the spirit of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, it's a spunky contrived, predictable mystery. No, the characters were not all complex, but at least the powers that be went to the trouble of making them entertaining and personable.I liked the idea of looking for sunken treasure. I liked the upbeat island soundtrack. I liked the funny characters. I liked the pretty scenes and the silly lines. I liked the random explosions and fight scenes, as pleasantly ridiculous as they were.Kate and Matthew have the chemistry they had in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". They have the sunny dispositions to pull off a mindless-but-fun storyline and to work with a wacky cast.It's mind candy in all its fluffy goodness."
4,Good deal,"I love this movie. I have it on dvd and thought, the picture has got to be awesome on blu-ray with all the water scenes from the places they made the movie. Clarity is everthing! Thank goodness for blu-ray!"
4,Great flick,This is a great flick! I really love the opening sequence with McConaughey. Truly an original intro(Very refreshing considering all the remakes/reboots Hollywood is churning out these days!) Pairing McConaughey and Hudson is always a recipe for success. I would recommend this fun movie to anyone who like adventure romance comedies.
2,Irritatingly foolish,"The one thing that annoys the viewer time and again in this movie is the lengthy dialogues and scenes (really badly overtimed), particularly involving Mathew and Kate and their co-stars. Scenes that are supposed to be funny turn out to be tiring and exasperating to watch instead. The scene where Kate throws the dining plates at her hosts after going into shock while meeting her ex was too much and really not funny. Although the movie tries to nail the character Gemma as the dumb one most of the other cast make a wonderful fool of themselves instead with those tiring long scenes. In fact the character Gemma offered some respite.Full points for the camera work as the beaches look beautiful with the lovely blue waters. The legend, Bob Marley's immortal ""Could you be loved"" is heard again, probably the song most used in movie soundtracks. Otherwise this is another of those flops for Mathew McConaughey."
2,Where is the chemistry??,This just wasn't what it could have been. There just wasn't any chemistry between the two main characters. THe story line just wasn't there and too scattered.
2,"Corny, predictable, beyond cheesey, forced slapstick humor, bwah..","I am a Matthew M fan and Kate Hudson can be decent at times. Together they can have some chemistry, however, this movie is as corny, cheesy, and about as non-funny as it gets. There is never any sense of excitement or danger since the bad-guy is a rapper, and the attempt at violence is slapstick and just not funny. Romantic comedy? I think not... it is just a ball of cheese!!"
1,This not like How to lose a guy in 10 days,"Matthew and Kate were awesome together in How to Lose a Guy in 10 days, so my expectations were quite high for Fool's Gold. Although everything funny or good about the movie was in the previews. This movie was extremely predictable and not a lot of time was taken on the movie, you could tell. The script could've used a bit of work. Overall I'm glad I rented it from work and didnt buy it. Fool's gold is definitetly just rental material."
3,Fun but not smart,It was funny and cute but the back story was a bit complicated. It compares to IN TO THE BLUE which I thought was better.
3,Chick flick or action movie?,"I admit- I usually love chick flicks in all their predictability. I own ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" But this movie couldn't decide whether it was a chick flick or an action movie so came off lacking on both ends. My verdict- worth a rent, but not worth buying."
3,Funny,This is a cute movie but has some scenes that are too explicit for me. Matt and Kate are funny and romantic at the same time.
4,Nice movie,"IM SURPRISED MORE PEOPLE DONT RATE THIS MOVIE HIGHER. Its witty comedy and at the same time i love the carabean vibe you get off this movie, it just puts you in a good mood. Ya notice they dont kill anybody either, the ""new guy"" hired by lilrabbit killed the previous security chief...and yet the ""new guy"" meant his death at the hands of KARMA. LILBunny just fell out the plane into the water.... This isnt a kill crazy movie like most modern movies , and notice the camera isnt being shaken around the entire time...THIS is a good quality film"
1,Racist garbage,"Lazy and sloppy from page 1 to the finish. This author couldn't be bothered doing research, and so substituted ethnic stereotyping for fact.The author has a tin ear for dialogue, or at least for dialogue taking place in a socioeconomic/ethnic melieu different from the author's own.There is a snotty superficiality about the tone, as if the people the author writes about could not have the least significance to her. I'll bet the only Irish, or Irish-American, people the author has ever known were people she paid to clean up after her.Stay away from this repellent nonsense."
4,Didn't like the inaccuracies,"This was a very well written book, so well written that I believed her description of the artwork. It got me interested in Vermeer, so I went on line to fine ""The Music Lesson"". Well, that painting is very different than the one she describes (and isn't it bigger? I think she describes the painting as only being inches by inches--well, we know where she says it fits in the end, but the real painting is about 2.5'x2') And the picture on the book is one of Vermeer's other paintings, ""A Lady Writing a Letter"". I don't understand why she did that. Poetic license, I guess, but she's playing with fact.Anyway, this is probably not a helpful review. I do recommend the book, it is well written and has a different, compelling story. The other reviews do it justice."
3,Pleasing,"There is something I admire about a writer who can say so much with so few words. That stated, this is a well-constructed look at art and politics. Some scenes are more fresh than others but you never feel you know this woman, Patricia. Her surface is fascinating but we never get to know her heart. Perhaps that is the point to this style but it left me cold."
3,"Well written, but slight.","Katharine Weber's ""The Music Lesson"" has plot enough for a 400 page novel- just a few of its themes include art theft, forgery, IRA splinter groups, mid-life affairs, and the death of a child. Why then is it only novella length? Like Weber's previous (and better)novel ""Objects in the Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear"", ""The Music Lesson"" is well written and compelling, but the brevity of this complex tale frustrated me. The narrator brought us briefly into her experiences, all of them interesting, and then left us all too quickly. I was left feeling not entirely satisfied."
4,a finely crafted novella and a good read,"This slim volume will only occupy an hour or two of your time, but I guarantee that you will be fully engrossed. Others have summarized the plot line well enough -- most of what we read is from Patricia's journal which she keeps while hidden away in a remote part of Ireland. The ""drama"" is more in the emotion and her recollections of encounters with art than in the art-heist plot. Though we don't get as much information as we want, the ending is satisfying and the novella so well crafted that the worst complaint you may have is that there is not more of it. By the end, you will also have an incredible urge to find a book of Vermeer's paintings and study them up close."
2,IRA redoux,"Can an old caper be brought up to date? Katharine Weber's The Music Lesson would like us to think so. With the hot topic of art history, and re-examination of the dutch master Vermeer, whose works have been recently mounted in celebrated exhibits, and other books about this painter, notably Tracy Chevalier's wonderfully satisfying The Girl with the Pearl Earring, the author involves us in personal tragedy, self-redemption through love and scholarship, all with sex as an easy bedfellow. From there it's a quick slide into crime, via politics, Irish-British ones at that. Was I the only one to guess the ending of this book a chapter earlier? Seems like deja vu to me."
3,Boring,"American art historian Patricia Dolan is enlisted by an Irish cousin to help steal a painting from Buckingham Palace. I read it all properly, but I was bored with it. (B)"
2,A Dissapointment,"for anyone looking for another ""Girl With a Pearl Earing"", do not expect anything similar in this book. Being a very dedicated Vermeer fan, i was excited to learn of this book but was dissapointed by it. while parts were interesting, the majority of the book was dull and the plot moved along slowly. i never even began to sympathize with the main character, patricia dolan, and i felt that the attempt made by the author to make the character more sympathetic was sappy and uninteresting. the only reason that i gave it two stars instead of one is a small plot twist at the end that i thought was slightly clever."
3,Do Yourself A Favor,"Please read the excerpts from Amazon on this page. When I tried to read this book, I found the style (of the beginning of the book) annoying as well as self-indulgent. However, you may like it, and maybe the book gets better later."
2,Two-and-a-half stars,"I made the mistake of assuming this book was connected toVermeer in some way, but it really isn't. Rather, it readsmainly thus: girl meets boy; boy is an Irish relative; they havea love affair (incestuous? Can't remember how closely relatedthey were....). Girl attempts to get in touch with her rootsby a sojourn in a small Irish village, where she becomes embroiled inan IRA-related plot that (surprise!) her new boyfriend/relativeis involved with. All the heroes are women; all the wretchedthugs are men. Result: a contemporary mystery story for women, with someheavy Irish whipped cream mixed in. But for me, the fact that the backdrop was so obviously biographical, lessened the element of fiction, and thus my ability to really enjoy the story."
4,What one will do for Love,"I found the story interesting from the perspective of how one's values can totally change due to love. The lady falls for a real young guy whose sole purpose is to make her fall in love with him so she will help him sell the ""Music Lesson"". Well he accomplished what he was suppose to with a ironic twist. I'll let you read the story to find out the surprise ending."
3,The Music Lesson,"Slight and spare, this novella has a few things going for it - a narrator with ""voice"", compelling plot that juxtaposes a mix of art, politics, loyalty and the transformative powers of both love and grief, but it ultimately fails on most levels. The charactors are mere vignettes, interesting, but not fully realized; the transformations are summarized by the narrator, as a means to justify moving the plot forward, not as emotions that are experienced by the reader, or maybe even the charactors. The ending is predictable. The spare voice, charactorization and narration are better matched to the short story medium than a novel."
1,your library has it. Save your time,"...something better. Katharine Weber has created a superficial, amateur, International Intrigue, Freedom & Stuff Like That background to provide Patricia Dolan; a lonely, forty-one year old American woman with a twenty-five year old stud cousin from Ireland named Mickey. He's really interested in Ireland's emancipation from England's domination. So is Dolan, apparently. However, nothing in Weber's development of this character convinces the reader she's motivated by anything more than a good lay with Mickey, absurdly nicknamed, ""Mix"" during conspiracy pillow talk. Sinn Fein, Mix! Yes, yes, YES! From Ireland with Love...read it & groan...with exasperation."
4,A valuable source,"This book (the original version) has all the basics to introduce the future differential equations/dynamical systems researchers into the field. Written by authorities in the field (Hirsch and Smale,) this text offers a wide variety of topics, including linear systems, local and global stability theory for non-linear systems, and applications to physics and biology. As an added treat, the inclusion of basic linear algebra and operator theory makes this a rather self-contained work. The dedicated reader will not be disappointed - the material is well organised with sufficient level of detail, illustration, and exercises."
5,Solid and basic book,"This book is a classical in the subject. It will provide you with solid information even if you are an absolut beginner with proficiency only in undergraduate algebra, calculus."
3,Not for the average undergrad!,"As a senior undergrad majoring in math and economics, this book is everything but an easy read. To all fellow undergrads who are not math superheroes (that should about 75% of us), if you happen to come across this book in an upcoming course description, it may be a good idea to look for alternative. Currently, I'm looking for another book that I may be able to use as a supplement to get me through this course with a passing grade. Up to this point in my math career, I have never come across a text as ungraspable as this one; this is unfortunate since it appears that there is a lot of knowledge and content on the pages."
1,A complete waste,"This is not a book, it's a piece of trash!!! This so called book is a meaningless mess which wasn't even understandable for the person who had a PhD in math and was teaching our class. Do NOT bother with this nonsense. if you want to learn something just read Ordinary Differential Equations by V. I. Arnold.I would have given no star if I could!!!Just go with Arnold's and I'll be WAY better off."
2,Penn is good but language is a barrier,"Penn had some excellent things to say and he said them well three hundred years ago. What he had to say is still excellent but, unfortunately, the old language makes the reading a chore. Since a contemporary language version is available, I recommend Eric Taylor's edition, (0836192052) published by Herald Press. Mr Taylor's endnotes and superior historical introduction are an added bonus."
2,a wordsmyth but no more,"I wonder what makes ""Rabbit is Rich"" so critically acclaimed. Who the hell is interested in an average American car-sales-man in his forties, decaying like a tooth somewhere in the midst of America, the worst place conceivable.True, Updike is an unsurpassed wordsmith, but I am totally indifferent concerning the plot.America has not very much redeeming features anyhow, except its literature, but this book is a all a yawn."
4,Rabbit's evolution takes a turn for the better,"Past annoyances have died or moved away and Harry has learned to embrace the materialistic, work-a-day work of the American middle class. He finds his social and carnal needs are better satisfied by selling cars and playing golf; rather than by feeble attempts to understand and live in a world of 1960's feminists and Black Panther wannabes. And, as always Updike gives Rabbit time to dwell on the finer points and places of the human female, in way only Harry Angstrom can."
4,Bazooka,"I expected a bit more, but for a size sounds great.I had to do install myself, so it is not perfect, I still need to redofits perfect in my trunk, VW Rabbit"
2,Not one of Seuss's best,"Reach for ""On Beyond Zebra"" instead, which has the same type of fanciful imaginings but minus the offensive renderings of ""Africans"" and ""Asians""."
4,Long story book,"I have not finished it, the grandchildren seem to get tired before the end of the story. I chose it because I volunteer at the zoo and have passed on my enthusiasm to my family."
5,been reading this a long time,"One of the few Seuss books that have disappeared over the years , it's great to be able to read it again. All kids will love this book"
1,Forgot the insensitive pictures in this book,"My husband loved this book as a little kid, so we bought it for our son. My husband didn't remember that there are a number of racially insensitive pictures in the book. We are now gluing a few pages together and I wished we had not purchased this book."
3,Meh -- not our favorite,"This was a library book we brought home, and we did read through it twice. But it just wasn't our favorite. Lots of substitute swear words: Gol-darnedest, etc.Also, it ran a little long.But it is fun to read it out loud, and the faster the better!"
3,Good Not Great,"This book is very good with the exception of one thing. The book has at least one euphemism with God's name. I try to teach my children not to use God's name in vain, even when done euphemistically. Abstain from the appearance of evil. I generally admire Seuss books greatly but was a bit disappointed in this."
2,Many negative messages outweight the positives...,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Dr. Seuss fan. This book does encourage a child's use of his/her imagination, and the fantasy is rich. However, there are elements in the book that disturb me. I understand that it was written in 1950, but I don't know that young children are capable of comprehending the difference. For example, Asians are quite stereotypically depicted, including this line, ""With helpers who all wear their eyes at a slant."" Africans are depicted in an even worse way; they look as though they were drawn in blackface, and they have enormous nose rings. The message of hunting down creatures (and taking pleasure in it) so that they can be caged in a zoo for display is also bothersome. I fully recognize that these things are in conflect with our family's values and that other families may disagree. However, I thought families with similar values might appreciate the heads-up."
3,Dated,"The racist elements of the book are certainly not out of the ordinary for 1950. (And they're much milder than in Seuss's cartoons of the 1940s.) However, I think many parents, and not just ""stuffed shirts"", will prefer not to invite their children to laugh, for example, at the idea of people with ""eyes that slant."" (The phrase is given strong emphasis -- ""slant"" is a rhyme word.) Obviously, I'm going to discuss such things with my daughter when she's old enough, and teach her to assess them for herself when she reads. But now she's only three, and I prefer to pass on to another book."
2,Won't work for T handle or small drills,"although the construction is impecable the holster really needs a leg belt to stay stable, also the pouch will not work well with t handle drills like a milwaukee, or small drills like 7.2 volt B&D. works greak with dewalt, but thats it as far as i can tell, better off buying the hook..."
5,These Holsters do Double Duty,"This is also a very good holster for the Ruger Mk II Scoped pistol with 6 7/8"" barrel. One of the few that will hold this particular handgun. For the price and quality, you can't go wrong"
2,"Too bulky, never use it.","Sounds like a good idea at the time, but I never seem to use this as it is rather bulky and more in the way than anything."
3,Bought it... collects dust... Bought drill Hook,"Just get the hook, this holsterfits my drill fine but when you are on a laddertrying to move around it is too bulky."
3,Not bad,for 10.00 im not complaining. Pretty good detail on it and the sith droid is a nice added bonus. If you want a cool darth maul toy on a budget this one isnt bad. a little bit smaller then what i hoped it would be . . . but im not complaining!
4,It's like Harlequin on tape. Older but fun!,"This film was done in 1995 so of course the hair dos are a bit dated. But for one low price to get 3 decent fun sexy films on one disk I think it's a great deal. This combo DVD is also a great gift to give to an older friend, aunt or grandma who likes reading harlequin tyes of books, but who you'd never give an explicit adult film to (I'm over 45, so I think someone 20 something wouldn't care for this). The stories are classic fantasy and the videography is professional and decently done. Again the value is really a good one, there is over 200 minutes on this disk. An entertaining collection to sit and watch with a glass of wine."
3,ONE HIT WONDER,"OK maybe someday I'll feel this is a worthwhile disc. But, for now, I can only deal with song, 'Come Go With Me.'"
3,"Diluted EW&F, nonetheless rare.","Verdine White's Kalimba production project comes off as EW&F without all the cosmic talk or the alleged vegetarianism. Get it only if you're a huge EW&F or Pockets fan and for the great mellow jam ""Elusive Lady"" which seems to be elusive everywhere else but in this collection."
1,This conch shell is a waste of your money!,"This product is not worth a dollar, much less $39.00. My young son saved up the money for this and was so excited about its arrival. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed when we finally saw it. It's tiny for one thing, but it's also poorly crafted with many imperfections and it doesn't make a good sound. The carving was nowhere near as cool as on the picture. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!"
2,Not what I remembered,The smell is different from what I remember and so I am not using this product. I am not sure it is an effective deodorant and I can't make a recommendation at this time.
3,It's okay,"""Representation and Reality"" is very much a work by the ""later Putnam"", a guy who, for better or worse, is nowhere near as influential in the philosophy of mind as the ""middle Putnam"" was, the Putnam of the 1960s and 1970s. Some of the views presented here are sort of interesting as you go through them, but I find that nothing by the later Putnam ever ends up really staying with me or substantially altering my picture of things. It's pleasant enough to read, but the experience is surprisingly junk-foodish (to the extent this is possible in analytic philosophy). Bottom line: if you're interested in the career trajectory of perhaps the greatest living American philosopher or in hearing some wide-ranging objections to certain central elements of contemporary philosophy of mind, this may be the book for you. However, ""Representation and Reality"" has neither been unfluential enough nor is it convincing enough for me to recommend it highly."
4,Well worth it,"Out of over half a dozen VB .NET books currently on my bookshelf, this is definitely the best of the lot. Overall, the majority of the explanations and code examples are clear and relatively concise. While it probably won't be the only reference you need, it's a great one to have on hand.I wouldn't, however, suggest this as the place to start if you are a beginning VB programmer. Begin with something a little more basic if you're just starting to learn."
4,Simply the best,"I've read various books about dotnet, this is definitively the best. Complete, coincise, small useful samples.Just lacks remoting, but more than 1600 pages makes this a heavyweight book.A must for the serious VB.Net programmer"
5,The VB.NET book for intermediate-level developers.,"I've just completed reading this book, reading about 5 hours a week for the last 4 months.This is a great book. It has both a wide scope and substantial depth. It should take the reader's level of awareness/competence of VB.NET from level 3 to 7 (on scale of 1 to 10).This book is easy to read, it provides many useful code examples to illustrate the concepts being discussed, and additionally Francesco has a welcomed habit of adding excellent tips as side points.It is primarily a tutorial that can be used as a reference source later.The book does make several references to VB6. However because of the clever writing/editing, it was not necessary for me to refer to the VB6 CD at any time.This book should be useful to intermediate-level developers any programming language.I would like to thank Francesco for what he has done."
4,Good Intermediate Book,"This is a book for those of you wanting a relatively broad overview of programming in Visual Basic .NET. The author does go into a good amount of detail in the topics covered.If you are just getting started with VB.NET, I would recommend first reading Visual Basic .NET Step-by-Step, 2003 Edition . (I know, normally I do not like Step-by-Step books, but it is a fair introduction to the topic.)If you are an advanced user, you probably will skim the book and use it as a reference. Remember that this book is tool-specific, this book is not designed to teach advanced programming topics such algorithms, etc."
3,Good book that's it,"Good ADO.NET coverage and satisfactory ASP.NET introduction. This book is good, mostly for reference. There are lots of examples but not complete programs, just code fragments. It would had been nice for more real world examples. The Inheritance and AOO chapters are great but Windows Forms and ASP.NET were superficial in my opinion but ok. A lot of Windows Forms components with some examples, but just code fragments. Recommended after you have read some other books."
3,"Too much ""Look how much I know""","No doubt about it; the book is comprehensive; but the problem is that at times the author drifts into the ""look how much I know about visual basic"" instead of trying to teach the subject matter. It explains items in great detail but obfuscates the point by going into too much detail.I've no doubt that Mr Balena knows VB.net; the problem is that having read his book I dont!"
2,Heavy stuff for the shelf.,This is the third book I'm reading in the .NET technology series. I found it difficult to understand certain information. May be because of my knowledge about .NET. For the beginners it is better to go for some other books.
2,Book does not cover .NET Remoting,"The book on the cover states Core Reference. Well, then where is .NET remoting ?"
5,Very Well Put Together,"This is my second reference book on VB.NET. The first one Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the .NET Framework Class Library is a compliment to this awesome book. This book is very explicit and detailed in explaining VB.NET in that it expands on the docs rather than quoting them verbatim. Since Francesco is a long time VB'er, I didn't expect anything less. The chapter on Threading and Advanced Win32 Techniques alone are worth the price of the book."
3,"Warm, but too predictable","Having lost a child, this was not the easiest movie to watch. Vanessa Redgrave was wonderful, she is able to project a warmth and love that never becomes cloying. Uncle Charlie was great fun but I never could get it straight as to where he fit in. The other roles were well played without ever really engaging me. The ending I found to be quite horrible. This is where the movie became an exercise in predictability and turned sharply to the maudlin and nice. Death may not be a horror to the dead, but it certainly is for the living and this movie ultimately fails to realize this."
5,One of the Best,"I will not even try to analyze this movie; I bought it on impulse because it starred Ms. Redgrave. If you are at all in touch with the spiritual side of your existence (notice I did not say religious) you will absolutely love this movie. And you will cry. And then you will feel better. And then you'll probably watch it again. It's based on a book (can't find it) ""Messages From A Soldier to His Mother"". If you know where to get the book, email me."
2,Interesting and different,"I'd never heard of this movie before. It was an ok story, I guess. The best thing about it was Ms. Redgrave--I loved her in this role. In addition, she reminded me of my mom before she died."
5,surprising and beautiful...,"I saw this film while flying to London from San Francisco. I'd never heard of it before, was curious, and it hooked me. I ended up watching it twice and then buying the DVD ... It's a bit of a tear jerker, heart warming variety, but I think Vanessa Redgrave does a superb performance and there's something in it that resonates, makes me enjoy watching it over and over. I'll have to pick up the book that it's drawn from."
3,Meh....it's ok.,"Although I like ""Black"" metal, this has some questionable tracks on it, that I wouldn't consider true black metal. There are still some really good tracks too be had on this,but in general its just ok."
2,Bucket Boss Flops!,"I am a carpenter who has owned this toolbelt for less than a year. It started out on a high note but in the last six months it's gone down hill. I was constantly adjusting the belt, and just last week the plastic buckle broke in our Canadian cold. Although it does have alot of storage space I wouldn't recommend it for those who rely on their tools to perform on a daly basis. (Great for the average home owner.)"
5,Functionality and Toughness at a Great Price!,"This tool belt is a great value. It's lightweight, comfortable and durable. The same quality belts usually cost 2 x as much!"
4,big D johnson,One should remember you will lose the durability of leather bag when you change to a rip stop bag.All the pockets are a nice feature.The buckel needs to be improved. I am always adjusting it.( along with my co-workers who purchased the same bag)Please take all comments in effect when designing the new bag.
1,Contractor's Rig????,"My advice is to pass on this tool belt. [After two months of use] this tool belt is coming apart at the seams with VERY light duty use[...]. I doubt it would last a week as a ""Contractor's Rig"".In addition it has been a pain to use since day one. The belt simply will not hold its position, if you buy this tool belt plan on occasionally wearing it around your ankles.Also, the front nail pockets flop around dumping their contents as you walk, kneel down, or climb ladders.I own other Bucket Boss items that have proven very durable and useful. In my opinion they missed their usual high mark on this one."
3,Give me more,The Bucket Boss toolbelt seems to have all a man like me could want and use but I and others need more. Actually more in the belt portion. All the toolbelts I've looked at lack the length in the belt to go around my girth. About a 52 waist. Give me more. Thanks.
5,Jim Walker producido por Stanley Clarke,"Este album es interesante ya que el gran virtuosos de la flauta traversa Jim Walker (por muchos años solista de Los Angeles Philharmonic e integrante de la famosa banda ""Free Flight"") es acompañado por grandes estrellas del jazz para producir un cd sui generis de smoot jazz destacando el sonido maravilloso de este gran flautista. Grandes músicos como Stanley Clarke (productor musical de este cd además), Mike Garson, Paul Jackson Jr., Vinny Coliauta, Alex Acuña, Brandford Marasalis en el últmo tema ""Passion Play"", etc., acompañan esta producción con muchos temas mélódicos con una pequeña cuota de improvisaciones en algunos de ellos.Un cd para disfrutar."
2,very frustrated,"i brought this cable from you. the drivers on the cd are the older verson, they do not work with win 2000. i went to targus and down loaded the drivers there. i am installing it correct, but it still does not work. win will not run install it. i keep on getting the yellow flag. what can you do to help me please."
1,very hard to get to work,Although this is a usb connection it has to be installed as a serial connection. I am still not able to sync but i keep trying. Do not buy this if you want an easy solution! It is good for charging ONLY.
2,NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,I was disappointed in the look of the briefcase. It will not work for office use. If you really are a contractor it may be great.
2,No Satisfied,"I expected a lot more than I received. I didn't like the quality of the fabric, the manner in which the handle was attached to the case and generally the way it was made. It didn't seem to be of Bucket Boss's typical quality."
1,"Bad design, cheaply built","The case arrived with the front clasp missing so I returned it. I probably would have returned it without the defect, as it is much smaller than it appears online."
4,sturdy man-purse,"I have been pleased with my purchase of the Bucket Boss Briefcase. It is replacing a leather man-purse that was constantly falling apart. The Bucket Boss is well constructed and is holding up well to heavy and rough working conditions. Lots of pockets for folders, tools, and gadgets! Very utilitarian, wish there was a more stylish version and an inch or two wider would make this the perfect man-purse."
2,"good idea, but my Thinkpad T61 wont fit","My laptop is too big for it, also there is no padding for one like a laptop bag should have. I would like to see an improved version of this a bit bigger with the proper padding to protect the computer. Maybe a few extra tool pockets. I would happy to pay more for a better bag."
2,Not the color pictured,"I was really disappointed when I received this. The color pictured, a rather muted brown, was what I was hoping for. Instead, this thing looks like someone took that dye and mixed a can of day-glo orange in with it. It's heinous. Maybe it was meant for contractors to be able to find it at the bottom of the ocean or in the event of a nuclear war or something, I don't know. The main color doesn't match the trim either.It's a shame too, because I really like the way the thing is made. It's sturdy and the material is heavy without being too stiff. It's comfortable to carry and the pocket layout is very intelligent and spacious. I would carry this thing for years if it was the color pictured.Overall, very disappointed. Would not recommend this, based on the color alone. I wouldn't have given it a second glance at a retail store, except maybe to confirm that the purchaser for that store had lost their mind."
3,Not a Bad Briefcase,"The briefcase isn't bad and it meets my needs. I wish it had zippered pouches, though. Reviews I read indicated that the exterior pouch didn't zip shut, but I needed a briefcase, and the price was good. Having used it for awhile now, I've learned how to work around the fact that the outer pouch doesn't close (the flap laps over and clicks shut, that's all), but it's still frustrating. I've had issues before with briefcases and bags I've purchased online, and I think in the future that I'll buy them from brick-and-mortar stores so I can examine them to see if they are exactly what I want."
2,No padding for a laptop,"Seems like decent quality but despite the listing stating there is ""room"" for a laptop, it is not a laptop bag and can't be used as one unless you don't give a hoot about protecting your laptop. There is no padding."
4,One of my Favorite Simpsons Charcters!,I have this particular figure in my collection. It is by far one of my favorites. Grandpa has wonderful detail and is just plain fun to look at. I have open mine and he has a proud place on the TV. I would recommend him to any true fan of the series.
5,A lovely vintage edition of this classic jewel,There is much beneath the surface in this beautiful story.I was able to study it with a French professor who is veryknowledgeable on the life of the author. His additionalinformation gave so much meaning to St-Exupéry's life and words.
2,He must of needed the money.,"Cant believe its Travolta. Im sure he cant either. I had this album , or something like it, as a kid.And yup its even worse than i remember. But funny enough it brings back good memories probably only for me. Cause I know John wants to forget!"
3,Not that bad,"I have seen Santee in the movie theatre and later on videotape. Though the other reviews are excellent, I understand that their disappointment reflects the very high level of Glenn Ford Westerns. I just went through the list which amazes me. This may me the worst Glenn Ford Western, but it is still better than many films that in Amazon pages get five stars. Ford is good here like always. The story may have some holes, but this is still an O.K. western."
4,Good entertainment,This is a option to spend yours in a good entertainment. Well done paper model! I recommend it!
2,Bird followers beware!,"The primary reason to pick up ""Bird Is Free"" is that it is alleged to include Bird's longest and fastest solo--on ""Lester Leaps In""--not his 1949 solo with Prez and Eldridge at a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert, but the performance from 1952 at the Rockland Palace that's included in the movie ""Bird"" (a doctored, distorted reproduction that's inferior to the original ""low-fi"" copies in print).Notice that it's not included among these downloads. But also be wary of the prohibitively-priced album versions (CD or LP). I suspect they contain the 3-4 minute excerpt rather than the complete performance. I would certainly require the seller's reassurance before putting out a hundred or more."
1,ATT is really bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW!!!!!! I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service. Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk. I know it is not the phone because I tried another phone and it still sounded bad. So if you want superior service go with Verizon, I plan on going back after this crappy two year contract is up and over with.The W810i is a nice phone though except for one thing.... the end call button is right next to the internet sign on button, so if you accidentally hit this button you will instantly be charged for going online..... tsk tsk tsk, I thought sony ericsson was better than this."
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I'm just starting to get into creating greeting cards with stamps and this set was deeply disappointing. The quality of the rubber is poor. The images are cut very shallow and ink invariably gets on the rest of the stamp and leaves marks on the printed image. I've tried several brands of ink and markers, all yielding poor results. The wood mounts are thin and do not provide enough gripping surface. Lightly sanding the rubber produced only slightly improved results. It should not be tricky to create a good image with high quality stamps. All in all, very inferior quality compared to the ""real"" wood block backed rubber stamps used to create greeting cards."
1,Positive Magic,"This book was nothing like I expected!! It was recommended by a friend ... however, I just couldn't get into it."
5,A Serious Text Introducing & Explaining Key Concepts,"In-Depth and Professionally Oriented, Brinkman's book explains all the key concepts of compositing, in an approachable way that will be useful for users of any brand of compositing software. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a solid introduction to the field of professional compositing for film and television effects."
4,Totally original and spicey look at pioneers!!,"If you enjoy reading about pioneer days, and char-acters that are so well described that you feel you know them, then you will love this engrossing story. I found myself thinking about this book when I wasn't reading it, a sure sign that the book was enjoyable. It is entriguing from the beginning where a lonely cowboy is looking for a place to call his own, and then when he finds a girl staying in his homestead, uninvited!! The story that unfolds is huge, with the characters growing older with the story. I hated to finish the book that was so full of the true flavor of pioneer days, hardships, big family life, incest, and lots of laughs along the way. I loved it!!"
4,"Excellent story, well-written, don't miss it!","This is an intelligent,literate book that I would highly recommend. The writing is excellent and the story is compelling. Mr. Hassler is one of our best contemporary writers, in my opinion. His characters are so convincing and the dialogue is just as people actually speak. I particularly enjoy his observations on everyday life situations that we all face. This book has everything from laugh-out-loud comedy (Blackie LaVoi and the entire hunting camp fracas) to tragedy, and everything in between. It deals with love, jealously, and selfishness contrasted with selflessness. The characters will in turn infuriate you and then endear themselves, but at all times they are real and believable and human. This is the third novel by Mr. Hassler I have read, and I also recommend Simon's Night and Grand Opening."
2,"Strangely compelling but tedious, not for animal lovers","The story line was atypical, but not necessarily a true characterization of people in the midwest. A truly sad story without much resolution for the the character Chris Mackenzie and his dying friend's wife Larry Quinn. But I was compelled to read to the end and in three sittings."
4,Good quality short handled brush,I needed a good quality short handled brush to do some chores around the house - both inside and out.This brush has been a great utility brush to accomplish those chores.
4,Lovely Film,"This film has no real plot, and a completely un-dramatic end. But it's a sensitive, honest portrayal of childish innocence and adventure, and it reflects the more ordinary aspects of Iranian life that most Americans rarely get to see. Highly recommend for those who are not plot-driven, appreciate foreign film, and are not easily bored."
3,A Nice Slice of Life,"This film is a nice ""slice of life"" of a culture different from my own. I can compare and contrast. I liked this movie. It is a simple story simply told. Incidentally, it is told in real time. The little girl who is the star is a fairly unsympathetic character. This is mainly because of her whining performance. This appears to be the only flaw in the film, but it is a major one. The young actor who plays her brother practically steals the show. I hope to see more of him in the future. Performances by the other actors, the mother and the tailor, are particularly good. All in all, I liked this movie and I recommend it."
2,Over rated,"This films scenes of Iranian street life were very interesting, but I couldn't enjoy the visuals at all. The pace of the film is crushingly slow, and the little girl got on my nerves. I hate to sound mean, but the way she lost the money and the way she always looked like she was about to cry got under my skin."
2,Cute,"It's not anything I would see twice. I guess that it was a movie aimed for the Nickelodeon channel. Unfortunately, most children would find it boring since most of the film centers on how this little girl is going to get her money out of a gutter. And unless you are an adult who looks at many things at an artistic perspective, you would rather wash dishes. If this movie wasn't set at a foriegn country, I don't think I would have watched it for as long as I did. I soley liked this movie because of the adorable and whinny little girl starring in it, not to mention that I learned that ""Vali"" or ""Bali"" means ""yes"" in Iran. I especially enjoy the conversation she had with the soldier and the way she questioned everything he said to her. Cute girl, but the movie is too empty and, except for the dialogue between the little girl and the soldier,it was a little too dim witted and simplistic for my taste."
3,good half movie,"It's disappointing that this film ate up the talents of some of my favorite foreign actors in a gravely flawed production. Some nice cinematography and some deft bit players are the only bright spots, so I hope the actors and production staff were well-paid for their parts in this turkey, as that's the only excuse for its existence I can imagine. The direction is more like ""directionless.""; I had to wonder if the director was sending up the mystery genre? Or just incompetent? Threads of plot disappear into nowhere, the setting flips between locales and eras with poor links, and several plausible twists and/or resolutions are studiously avoided in favor of some vague revenge motive, further complicated with a criminal mastermind sub-plot that is introduced and then never developed or connected to the main scenario. Any road, the ending is not only unexpected but clumsy and improbable, leaving the viewer with the question: Hey, where's the rest of the movie?"
2,Poor rendition of a great novel,"The Man from Beijing is an excellent murder mystery. Unfortunately, the German production company mangled the story to the point that it is a poor rendition of the original book. The cast turned in a mediocre performance as well. Amazon instant video didn't help matters with the audio and video out of sync for all but the last five minutes of the movie. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the book and were very disappointed with the movie."
3,"It's a 'who done it', type movie....","If you have NOTHING better to do for three hours, you mightlike this. To cut a long story short, it's about flashbacks towhen Chinese help built the railroad and had a brutal whiteboss, who raped and killed a Chinese wife.Then the young boy's ancestors demanded revenge, to save face and honor. They hire a hit man who kills the ancestors of the white guy and it goes on and on. FF to halfway.....The main player is a Swedish female judgewho is the only remaining descendant of the white guy andshe goes to China to find the killer. It's long. I'm surethis is a re-release and this is an OLD picture made in the 90's.It's sad what America did to the Chinese to get the railroadbuilt and we owe them penance for their forced service."
4,Delicate Hobo Cut Bag,"I like this bag, especilly appropriate for nice pair of jeans. One drawback, the leather cut out is delicate it can snug easily. One of the cut-out snug and broke and I have my husband fix it. I will still use it but will keep in mind and remember not to snug it to any objects.Overall well done nicely done inticate leather works."
1,Not worth the bother of turning the pages,"This book purports to be an ""insider"" view of the Bern death. Instead, you get page after page of ""look how important I was"", worthless gossip about office jokes and nothing you couldn't find on Wikipedia.What's worse is that after each chapter ending, the teaser is that the NEXT chapter will ""tell all"" but it never happens. If you're looking for a new slant on an interesting part of Old Hollywood, you won't find it. If you're looking for a definitive answer to an old mystery, you won't find it. If you're looking for excellent writing, you won't find it.However, it was cheap."
1,Very breakable,The plastic is very soft and the hinge area broke within 10 minutes of opening the package. They are cute but be warned they are not likely to last very long. I guess for $5 with free 2 day shipping I should have expected them to be crappy.
2,Broke within the first couple of hours,"Bought for a 4-year old as a toy. It looked great and fit great, but broke the first time he played with it. The hinges are made of really cheap/weak plastic."
2,Broke,These glasses broke within a week. My 7 year old was not being rough or hard on them. A very cheap product. Save your money.
2,breaks easily,"Although my 6-year-old looked adorable in these glasses and the quidditch robes, they broke the third time he took them off his face. We tried to repair them with super glue, but they kept breaking (in different spots around the glue)."
5,Love them!,These glasses are absolutely adorable and very comfortable for my two year old little boy to wear. He loves them! I would definitely recommend these glasses as costume wear or just for fun!
1,Don't waste your money,These glasses are a waste of money. They are sized to fit a child but not made to be handled by one. My 5yo child had them out of the package for no more than 30 seconds when one of the temple pieces broke at the hinge. While trying to repair them with superglue the other temple broke at the same location. They are made poorly and I wouldn't bother.
1,not adaquate,I purchased this as a gift and discovered that it was not a good choice. The belt was too small for a man and there was no hammer loop which proved to be most irratating. I wished I would have just returned it.
4,Bird Breaks Out,"These classic recordings from 1945 clearly indicate the striking difference between the styles of some of the jazz great from the swing era(Red Norvo, Teddy Wilson, Slam Stewart)and the major innovators from the modern, so called, be-bop genre: Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.Bird (Parker) and Diz not only illustrate early on the harmonic inventiveness inherent in their playing, but also a new, sophisticatedapproach to rhythm, with pauses, rests,and off-beats unheard of prior to their arrival on the scene. Also worthy of note is the ability of Parker and Gillespie to ""blend in"" with the predominately swing oriented playerswithout losing grip on what they wanted to say. A characteristic of only the greatest of players. These are classicrecordings worthy of a place in the collections of both the uninitiated as well as the esoterically inclined. My rating: Four and a half stars."
2,Great video quality was terrible.,Quality of the DVD was no good! Skipped and was stratched. It said it was acceptable but I don't think acceptable if skipping and stratched.
3,Italian Cooking,"recipes are short, some cooking experience is necessary, though.Most recipes do not give a cooking or baking temperature.Most recipes seem to be family recipes"
3,"impractical for cooking, interesting as history","This book is better used for reference on the history of Italian home cooking than used as a recipe guide. The quantities and instructions are vague, but there is a wealth of ideas for creative cooks and food history fans--particularly on the uses of organ meats."
1,Not Well Done,It is written in paragraph form describing methods for each recipe. There is no list or amount of ingredients to use in traditional list form. Is difficult to cook by using your Fire Kindle bought at Amazon.Com.
2,Italian Cook Book The Art of Eating Well,Not as good as I expected in an Italian Cook Book. I found little that I would like to make and eat.
3,average,"This product is not what I expected at all. I thought that I would be able to use it while I travel, but I can not since these tops do not really lock - they just ""flip"" close. It also does not really grab child's attention. The education value is questionable since I am not sure how they choose images for this ""lunch box"" - there are plenty of vegetable or fruit pictures they could use, but instead there are some sea creatures and maybe a monster (not sure who he is)...So, all and all I would not suggest..."
5,"Fantastic anthology! Very explicit, wonderfully tender and loving..","It needs to be mentioned that in order to really love this collection, you should already have a true love of poetry as well. That's really what makes this work as well as it does. Yes, the poems are explicit, physically sensual celebrations (and afterglows) of sexual pleasure. But the medium is SO often misused. It's either simply diving into smut, or even worse burying sex in some transcendental fugue that not even Don Juan could wade through.This book however, touches all the right places. Between physical pleasure, intellectual lust, and emotional connections: The most satisfying and enjoyable sex is experienced in long-term relationships based on respect, trust, and love. If you love great poetry, AND great sex, this is for you."
1,Sent the wrong item,I ordered one Fuji NP40 Battery.I wanted the original...no knock offs.Two non-Fuji batteries and one camera case for who knows what camera showed up. The staff answered my email in 3 business days. They sent me a free call tag. A full credit was received shortly thereafter. I found the original NP40 battery at Best Buy for $39.99 and tax. More than I wanted to pay but it is the real thing. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
1,Would not purchase from Adorama Camera Again,"I am reviewing the ADORAMA CAMERA, INC. Co.This item was ordered on Feb. 19, 2007. I paid $15. for express mail. The order was not received until after March 1, 2007, which was after we had left for Hungary. The company credited my account with only the price of the item ($33.95)...not the $14.95 for express delivery. Since the item was not shipped express delivery I should have received the entire amount of $48.90 back. I WOULD NOT BUY FROM ADORAMA CAMERA AGAIN."
3,maybe the smallest battery for camera,"it just like a double thick size of a smart media, with its 680mAh you can still takes over hundred photo using LCD..."
1,Not as advertised,"Like another reviewer, I ordered this based on the picture and description in the ad that clearly states it is a Fujifilm NP-40 battery. What I received is a knock off item with no brand name on it at all. It obviously works but I have no idea for how long. I am ok with off-brand items as long as they are honest about it upfront. But in this case it is clearly a deceptive tactic. I re-checked my order confirmation and sure enough it clearly states ""Fujifilm NP40 Rechargeable Battery"". This is NOT a Fujifilm. I wonder if Fuji knows these guys are using their name like that..."
2,Not as advertised,"Amazon picture shows an original Japanese-produced NP-40 with 3.7V and 710mAh (just like the one I got with my F810). What I got was a Fujifilm-branded Chinese-produced NP-40 with 3.6V and 750 mAh. YES, IT WORKS, but it's just obviously cheaper. Skepticism is a virtue."
1,NP40 battery,I ordered a Fujifilm NP40 Rechargeable battery for my camera. I paid for a Fujifilm battery not a knockoff battery. I am very disappointed!! Guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered and paid the higher price. Could have saved money! Won't do that again!!
3,Good nutrition but dry as stale crackers,The nutrition content of the Nature's Valley 100% Natural Oat & Honey Granola Bar is relatively balanced for a granola bar. They have saved me more than once late in a round of golf when walking the course. But...They are really dry. Make sure you eat them in small bites and have plenty of fluids available.
5,Beautiful collection of short stories!,"House of the Sleeping Beauties is one of my favorite anthologies, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on another book from this brilliant author. The stories in Palm of the Hand are full of poetic and philosophical undertones and magical realism. My favorite one is ""Bamboo-Leaf Boats,"" a poignant tale about a woman who grieves the loss of her fiance. The pain the protagonist goes through moved me. The other stories are beautiful as well. I suggest you read this wonderful book..."
3,More History than Blues,"This DVD is NOT dedicated to Blues history. It will give you an overview of what was happening politically in America from the late 1800's to today and what music was popular with Black Americans. It includes Jazz and Swing as well as Blues. I liked the footage of Leadbelly, Billie Holiday, and others. I did not like that it only briefly mentions Robert Johnson. No real history of the Blues here. I would only recommend this DVD to anyone who wants an American history lesson to learn about sharecropping, how Black Americans served in the military, etc. It does a good job of covering Black history."
2,disappointing,"the dvd is a fairly good description of the plight of the black americian in the amount of time allotted by a dvd but as a history of the blues i believe that it comes up short. the musical performances are definitely geared toward the jazzier side of blues as is the focus of the majority of the film. folk blues, chicago, new orleans, texas, apilachian, ect, either barely get a mention or no mention at all. also cronologically it seemed to jump around a bit they didnt seem to be consistently foloing a time line"
3,ok,"6 trax. almost 40 minutes. 1 original def mix 2 dead zone 3 def instrumental 4 mo mo beats 5 7"" radio mix 6 glamourous mix."
3,"Appalling, tedious, yet curiously entertaining.","Some chapters don't really deal with the wars but culture which is irrelevant. The prelude to the war with China and Khwarezm was interesting, but description was a little too tedious. Keeps repeating how he ravaged the cities. Interesting notes about the Christian hero Prester John."
1,the nashville sound,This item was a gift for my homebound parents. The DVD will not play. It shipped to another area of the State and cannot return until I go get the DVD in about two weeks.
1,Bad Quality,This is very poor quality. Dark footage. Lighting is awful. Looks like it has been copied off of an old tape.... not what I expected.
4,Great tool bag,"I am a field service turbine mechanic. When I get to a job site and my boxes are unloaded and the game plan is hashed out, the first thing I do is figure out what tools I am going to need. Not just for one or two jobs. I hate going back and forth from a tool box. I plan it out, and put everything I need (within reason) into a tool bag. Well, I am please with this bag... plenty of room, plenty of pockets. Nice and sturdy, good balanced feel.Now for the cons. You can't lock the zipper. I don't want to lock it to keep people from stealing... it's to keep them from borrowing without asking. But no problem I can put some grommets on BUT not everyone can. Also a couple of nice zippered pouches would be very handy for small bits n pieces.Would I recommend? Yes. Great price, good quality."
3,"A good ""medium"" duty bag","Purchased in August 2008 and used everyday for TV service calls. Being as it as used as such and NOT loaded heavily with tools I expected it would last 5 years or so at least. The plastic sliding shoulder ""pad"" that slides freely on the shoulder strap gave out last year. Then, one of the shoulder strap tie points ripped off. Now, the metal ""frame"" around the mouth has started protruding through the fabric. I was expecting more from something advertised as heavy duty. I have contacted the company and will update if and when I get a response. In the meantime I have ordered a replacement, another Bucket Boss, the Super Gatemouth. It's not a bad product, just don't expect to get a ""lifetime"" of service, unless your idea of a lifetime is 3 years or so."
2,kind of heavy and a little small,"I haven't compared this to a lot of bags but I find it heavy and uncomfortable to want to carry those few things on a daily level ( I end up using a side bag instead) and it's a bit small to have a as a go-to bag for projects outside of the shop. The pockets are also too small to be helpful. I have stabbed under my fingernails a few times looking for bits, screws, pens and the like."
5,Perfect fit,I purchased this product to carry my 4 socket sets & their magnetic holders plus other stuff.Good quality build comfortable to carry with shoulder strap.Works great! I think this bag might outlive my career.
5,A Great Read For Heading Into Winter,"I thoroughly enjoyed Pete Vordenberg's story and can hardly wait for the snow to fly this winter. While I can say I'm especially motivated to get on the XC trails now, I can't say I'll be draggng a log behind me as part of my experience! What an incredibe story and entertaining read. I'm hoping to see a follow up book (non-fiction or fiction) from this talented writer."
5,What more could you want?,"You got the perfect location,...girls, kick ... funny Jack Black, and some surf bums. Now what else could you possibly ask for in a movie? About a guy who takes the death of his friend way too seriously but in the end finds out what is really important. The whole time I was watching this I was just thinking in my head how jealous I was cuz I wanted to live like that. Anyone who likes a fun movie about having fun and learning how important your friends are, needs to see this."
3,Not even Jack Black could save this one...,"Apparently if you are the son of somebody famous it entitles you to be SOMEONE. This movie features a couple of offsprings of some really good hollywood people (The sons of Tom Hanks and Lawrence Kasdan and the daughter of Sissy Spacek), too bad they don't come even near their parents talent in a bad day. They S-U-C-K, big time. The only high point is Jack Black. He is really cool in this one. If you want to laugh with this movie just watch the trailers, they have every single joke in the movie. Yeah, that's right, that's all the comedy in this movie... well, that and the thought of this really bad newcomers sharing blood with their respective parents."
3,Funny look at life anywhere,"I always enjoyed Colin Hanks on the TV series Roswell and looked forward to seeing his first lead role in a movie. Of course, it helped that the movie also features a strong supporting cast and cameos from some of the most loved comedy actors in Hollywood. Orange County offers a funny look at life in a particular part of California, but it finds constant humor in the frustrations of school, relationships, and ambitions anywhere. Hanks carries his Everyman role with charm."
4,Orange Country,"Jack Black is hysterical. Actually all the characters are well written, but the interaction between the two brothers is just GREAT!!"
1,DVD,THEY SENT ME THE COMPLETE WRONG ITEM!!!! DON'T EVER GO THROUGH THIS COMPANY!!!!!! I waited FOUR weeks for my item and it was completely wrong
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Okay, I wasn't expecting much out of this movie. A standard comming of age/struggle to get into dream college story added with some comic relief was all I was expecting. Yes, the movie is all of that, but more. It has real heart that comes through to the audience. There's some good acting and good character development. Jack Black is of course gleefully absurd as usual, and Colin Hanks is solid as the main character. Also watch for a delightful cameo by Ben Stiller. Schuyler Fisk is a welcome and refreshing addition to the cast as Hanks' charming girlfriend. What can I say? She's just really really...likeable. She's very pretty, but not unbelievably so. She's got that down-to-earth, girl-next-door quality that many boast but few possess. In other words, we believe she's a real person. And the ending is very good, very original. I won't spoil it per se, but let's just say that I'm a UC Berkeley student, and the ending made me happy. Go Bears...."
4,Likeble Cast make it Worth It.,"I was very surprised to enjoy this move. If you ever want to watch a movie you can just sit back and enjoy then this is it. Sean (the very charmig and likeable Colin Hanks) wants to go to Stanford, but the school guidance couselor(a hysterical Lily Tomlin) sends the wrong transcripts, therefore Sean goes out of his way to get accepted. Of course the movie then has many differnt obstacles Sean has to face to do this, like his alcholic mother(the always great Catherine Ohara), his druggie slob brother(Jack Black, in one of his best and funniest roles, and his sweet and loving girlfriend Ashly(the very talented Shuyler Fisk). Many things go wrong which make for a very funny and entertaing movie. The ending is a little predictable but the cast is so wonderful that they pull off what could have been another by the numbers, gross out comedy."
5,100% HYSTERICAL.,"This movie is hilarious. Up till I saw it i had never even heard of Colin Hanks never mind the fact that Tom Hanks had an actor for a son. Colin is a great actor and plays his character perfectly. But, I have to give most of my credit to Jack Black for being one of THE most hysterical characters EVER! He is so freakin funny! You will laugh your head off even my parents were cracking up! Just one question: Why is this movie [money] Whatever. I'll probably buy the DVD anyway. Awesome movie, great soundtrack too."
3,"Not enough Jack Black, too much Colin Hanks!","Ok, Colin Hanks is a bit cute if you don't mind the freaky state of mind he puts you in with his total resemblance to his dad, Tom Hanks. It was pretty good for a teen movie. The story line actually stayed IN LINE and the acting was pretty good and true to...what? But...it just smelled all too much like a gift to Hanks's son to get into the acting world. Its almost...too perfect; with all the character cameos in it--Chevy Chase, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, Harrold Ramis, even Ben Stiller! All star cast in the hilarious hijinks of a So CA boy trying to get into Stanford, but thwarted continually by his ha ha CRAZY family!Oh that John Lithgow and Catherine O'Hara! And those silly typical... jokes that are a trademark of MTV male writers. But Jack Black was great. I wish there'd of been more scenes with him in it. Check out the deleted scenes with him in it. Its worth it all. ""You'll never catch the Rooster, buddy."""
2,Very Average,finally saw this Last Night&while it had some Cool Moments it was a Standard Modern Day comedy overall.Colin Hanks at best was doing His Pop's Cutting Room Floor Routines from Bossom Buddies.He is very Boring thus far in His Career.Jack Black needs to reach out more because He can have alot more to offer if He gets beyond sameness in His past few films.
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made,"This movie was awful! The plot was horrible, the jokes were dumb, and the sexual content was equivalent to that of an R rated movie. Ive never seen a movie that I hate more. If you insist on watching this dumb movie, send it to cleanflicks, but the plot isnt worth watching anyways."
2,Almost good,"This is a light, fun, dumb movie that could have been good. Colin Hanks plays a young guy who wants to be a writer and not a surfer. His family is crazy and no one understands him, but his girlfriend is supportive. The jokes are unoriginal but dependable --- people in wheelchairs slam into moving cars, someone flips out during a dinner party, eccentric teachers act weird for comic effect, someone accidentally takes drugs and does something crazy, etc. Jack Black stands out (as usual) as a stoner brother with a healthy slacker attitude. He's usually in his underwear, telling everyone to chill out.The only really good moment is at the end, with a cameo appearance by a famous actor. At that moment, the movie suddenly becomes interesting. It's a moment that emphasizes just how mediocre the rest of the movie is. I recommend this to anyone who likes mindless entertainment. You'll laugh a little, you won't feel ripped off, and you'll forget the movie a week later."
5,Love It.,"I find this movie to be ridiculously funny. Catherine O'hara cracks me up as the drunk depressed mom, Jack Black is perfect as the drug addicted, degenerate brother. Then you have BOB, the cheezy cheerleaders etc. The whole movie is hysterical, a great movie to just laugh to. This is not the type of film you take seriously, you just enjoy it."
2,"kooky fun, but never really takes off","Seemed like a great premise: some nearly-deserving guy losing his mind to get into a top-tier university. The problem from my end was that they shouldn't have scripted that thing about the mixed-up transcripts. That spoiled a lot of the hijinks that ensued, since you kept thinking that Stanford would surely made an exception in that case and reexamine his admissions package. Failing that, litigation would likely have saved the day. So I really didn't buy the kid's craziness because I never found his desperation convincing."
4,Orange County,"I hate teen movies. Absolutely hate 'em. They're generally cliched, dorky, poorly acted and written, and painfully unfunny. That said, ""Orange County"" is a peach. Occasionally crude enough to attract the adolescent boys in the audience, it's still sweet, funny, and just, well, downright enjoyable. The cast is fine - Colin Hanks and Schuyler Fisk are fine young actors, Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow shine as Hanks' wacky parents, and Jack Black is...Jack Black. Well written by Mike White (""Chuck and Buck""), with plenty of funny gags leading up to (believe it or not) a worthwhile message, ""Orange County"" is not too sweet, not too sour. It's just right."
3,Jack Black makes this movie,"My title pretty much sums up what I have to say about ""Orange County"" -- which I am not sure was a comedy as the laughs were far and few between.Both Black, as a total wastoid brother of the main character, Shaun, and the small roles by the comedic actors/actresses from the age 40 and up, were genuinely funny.The story wasn't bad, it just couldn't decide whether it was a comedy or a drama. It's about Shaun Brumder, played by Colin Hanks(Toms' son), and his quest to attend Stanford so he can study with a writer whose book, ""Straight Jacket"", he discovers while on the beach with his surfer buds.Not really a bad idea at all. It just wasn't executed as well as it could have been.Worth watching if you absolutely LOVE Jack Black. He is hysterically funny in this."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Watching Orange County was the worst spent 83 minutes of my life. We only watched the whole movie out of morbid curiosity, or maybe we were hoping it would somehow redeem itself. It never did....Jack Black made a poor decision choosing to play in this movie. He was the only saving grace that I could find. (Jack, I have found you to be a comic genius in the other movies you have been in, i.e. High Fidelity, Shallow Hall. You are even good in Enemy of the State. Do not lower your standards again. You deserve better.)"
3,Nothing to get excited about!,"I went to this movie hoping that would be more than just another teen movie. Well, it was but it wasn't much better. The plot was predictable but the jokes were enough for me. They were not all origenel but they will make most teens or preteens laugh! Overall if you really wan't to see this movie don't waste your money in theaters, just rent it when it comes out."
5,one of THE most underrated comedies.,"I hate that this movie isn't considered at least a classic for its genre. This is my favorite comedy that came out this year and it has a bit more depth than the usual teen comedy, a bit more absurdity and a lot more laughs. Truly the best cast i've seen together in a comedy.. I just don't get it. This movie is hilarious. Great performances and great laughs that are never cheap. Love it."
5,Bob is the man!,Orange County is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.All of the charecter's played a good part and my favorite charecter was Colin Hanks step dad Bob.He is an old man that is abused by Jack Black but it was all an accident.Jack Black is so funny in this movie and he plays a lazzy drunken 25 year old that only wears his under wear.Colin Hanks plays a good part as a tennager tring to get into Stanford Univercity.John Lithgow plays Colin Hanks father that has a popped blood vesel in his brain and he only cares about himself so when Colin Hanks asks to call Stanford he refuses and I can't tell the end but it is really funny.I hope you see this movie.
2,You've seen it all before...,"Colin Hanks? I didn't even know that Tom Hanks had a son, much less that he was an actor. In Orange County, Colin does display some of the early comedic mannerisms of his father such as his high pitched banter and facial expressions. Hanks does a decent job as the male lead but the story line is weak. As a film, Orange County is rather bland family entertainment. The only two characters really explored are hanks and his girlfriend. Jack Black, who was heavily touted in ads as having an expanded role is scattered throughout the film at best. Every town has it's own version of Lance, the kid who doesn't work or go to school, parties hard and has no ambition. Some of his lines are funny and he truly carries the film in the scenes he is in. But they are few and far between. Clocking in at just over 82 minutes, Orange County is a journey to be taken only by the cable viewer. Not Recommended."
5,Haha Awsome,"This movie I'd bet is totally under-rated. It is really funny and on top of that it has a real good story line and plot, get on this movie."
5,Great movie,"This movie was very inspirational, but I really want to know if the book in the movie really exists. If anyone knows please contact me at NickKyle9@hotmail.com"
5,Great oven,This is my first cast iron pot and I love it! It was not pre-season (that what I wanted) so I seasoned it myself. I bought it to cook a real plov (asian pilaf).The meal I cook in it doesn't turn black or have a metallic smell and taste. Great product for a great price.
1,not what I expected,The description on line is not what is in the bookI wanted the life of jesusI was disappointed
2,Good content bad book,"this may be more of a customer satisfaction issue. AN Wilson is a bit of a wandering writer, but my issue is really with the physical condition of the copy I received. Listed as ""Very Good"" I received a copy with yellow pages, several creases and a tear in the cover, long hairs in the book, and writing throughout. not my idea of ""Very Good"" condition."
4,Bread Machine Baking,"I bought a bread machine for $15.00 at a garage sale and it sat idle on my counter for months till my friend invited me over for Calzones (delicious!) and showed me this book when I asked him about the delicious crust. I got the book for myself and have been making breads of all sorts ever since. I never could get the hang of yeast breads, but with this book it's easy and fun!!"
5,A great book!,I got this book at the library and can't seem to live without it. I stick with the basic breads but the advice and hints in the front of the book alone are worth the price of the book. Delish!
2,Good ideas but no follow thorugh,"Like the first reviewer, I've not found a recipe that doesn't need more liquid. I'm surprised that the other reviewers were able to follow the recipes without adjustments. Good book for ideas but be prepared to adjust the amounts!"
5,Rose Petal Preserves? I found it quite enjoyable.,"I'm a big peanut butter and jelly fan. This stuff was great with a fresh taste which was most pleasing. Straight out of the jar onto a slice of home baked bread almost brought a tear to my good eye, it was so good. The jelly was even in texture and spread nicely. The jar looks great on the kitchen table too. I will definitely buy more."
1,Don't waste your money,"Lance Armstrong is a lousy doper who has systematically tried to destroy anyone who tries to tell the truth about how he ""won"" his tours.Why not get a book of pictures of your pharmacist...?"
3,"Here once, gone now","If you're a Lance fan, it's a good piece to have; I was, but when I was over it, I sold it."
2,Self esteem anyone???,"I felt like the story just went in circles. No matter what the heroine never felt worthly, loved, beautiful, bla bla bla. So she had red hair and freckles. Since when did that make you an ugly duckling? Up to the VERY end of the book she was worried her man didn't love her when he never once did anything to prove otherwise. Also I'm sure she was meant to come across as strong willed (which I love when they are not weak) but she just came across very unlikable. I kept wondering why he did like her so much! I also usually love the secondary characters but just didn't feel anything for anyone."
2,One hit wonder.,"I made this purchase for one song ""Do It Anyway You Wanna"". ""Nursery Rhymes"" is okay. I remember them from back in the day."
4,People's Choice,"The songs that stand out on this collection are ""Nursery Rhymes"" and, of course ""Do it any way you wanna."" By the sound, I just knew that ""Do it any way you wanna"" was K.C. and the Sunshine band. But boy, was I wrong!! Four stars for this disc!!"
3,Actually..kinda interesting,"Ok, we all hate college books. That much is true. But this book actually is kind of interesting, and pretty well up to date, mentioning things from as recent as last year. It's especially great for notes and such and hopefully if your professor sticks close to it, will help you immensely come test time.Plus, there's a picture of Pikachu and Togepi from Pokemon in the back. So it automatically gets a thousand awesome points."
3,Slightly Disappointing.,"I first listened to Elodia, and was blown away by how well it was. When I received Fassade and listened it for the first time, I could instantly tell it wasn't as good as Elodia. Even the single, 'Der Morgen Danach' seems slightly lackluster. In Fassade, the symphonics move a little to the side, and the electric guitars move in. This makes Fassade a lot harder sounding than Elodia. There's nothing really new on Fassade, so it basically sounds like a harder, more metallic version of Elodia.Don't get this CD first. Get Elodia first, and when you do, you'll see how much better it is than Fassade."
4,Super Nutrition Men's Blend Vitamin,"With little research, I started taking these vitamins at a friend's (vitamin junkie) suggestion. They are not cheap and I didn't take the recommended dosage. After about eight months I decided to quit --and then I noticed the a lower energy level in my daily activity. It must have made a difference so I restarted the regiment. Prompt shipping of product."
2,"Dated, horrible mess of a book","This just goes to show that even though you might have a dozen authors from MIT, they still can't manage to write a coherent, readable book. The organization of the book is horrible, with hardly any sub-sections and massive blocks of text--this makes it almost impossible to find the information you're looking for without digging through the index. The ordering of the chapters is haphazard and they range in quality from extremely basic to completely esoteric. I would strongly recommend against using this book if at all possible, as there are better written, more contemporary works available that address this subject."
3,Useful,Useful book to collect all in one the main subjects about the topic. Useful handbook to have at hand a rigorous point to start to study the subject without loosing between information.
5,Easy transfers for any Surface,"Transfers! Who can resist them! Even as children we were interested in this craft. Well, this book is not for children, no, it is for all of us adult crafters that aspire to produce spectacular work with ease and satisfaction!"
1,nothing new,"this book is derivative of the wonderful ""transfer"" by isabel de cordova- which is the best book on this subject i've seen- ms. cordova's book has more clever ideas and much better design."
1,False advertisement,"""This is NOT all stainless steel as it says. the black hinge part is PLASTIC, can be easily twisted and bent/broken. Buyers should go with one that appears to be ALL metal or steel. I made a big mistake buying this!!"""
5,v-ball tacks.,"These sturdy tacks are a unique and adorable way for your teen volleyball fan to dress up her bedroom bulletin board. I gave a couple of sets of these tacks to my daughter in her Christmas stocking and they were a perfect, low cost way to personalize her personal message center."
3,Bucket boss bag,"I recently purchased the 56 pocket bucket boss tool organizer and am fairly happy with the purchase. The many pockets come in real handy. The only problem I have had is with some of the stitching on a few of the pockets where the stitching has come apart. I was hoping that it would have a little heavier stitching to prevent this. It's only been a couple of the pockets, but I've only had it for about a month."
5,Bucket Boss is still the best,"As an apartment building owner I bought a bucket boss about 20 years ago. It worked well but finally sprouted some holes! I checked a few home-improvement stores but could find nothing comparable and certainly nothing at the price. A lot of puerile imitators! When I saw this on Amazon I thought it would fill the bill and it certainly does! More pockets, better organized. I even have a few left over! The best ever!"
4,Where's the Bucket?,"Received the Bucket Boss today and it's great. One problem, though (and this is really Amazon's fault).If you're like me and you're new to Bucket Boss products, you should know that you'll need to buy the bucket separately. What you'll receive is a vinyl organizer that slips over a 4.5 gallon bucket. When I purchased it, there was no mention anywhere on the page, including in the reviews, that the bucket was not included, so I just assumed it came with the organizer. No big deal since buckets aren't expensive, but it would have been nice to know when I made the decision to buy it.However, the organizer is a very sturdy and well-made item which can hold quite a lot, perfect for a house where no one can ever find the right tool, tape, scissors, etc."
4,Good solution for a spread out tool box,"Product seemed pretty sturdy, and everything seemed to fit well. The only thing I could see is that when the buckets fully loaded, the small bucket handle makes it somewhat difficult to carry, but that could be easily remedied."
5,How to make good use of a spare bucket,"This is a great way to take an ordinary bucket and make it useful. All the tools can be seen and used without digging around, and the inside can hold all sorts of things (it is a bucket, after all!).It is made of nice heavy material that won't tear or puncture."
3,Pretty Good.,I think it would be better if the thing came with the tools it shows or else just show the bucket with no tools.
4,Ingenious design for practicality,"The Bucket Boss is an organizer first. Ingeniously designed to fit over a 5 gallon bucket, the durable canvas material loaded with pockets allows one to organize family tools eliminating clutter. It eliminates having to take out tools from the generic tool box just to find what you need. Also, would be great for organizing specific tools such as those for gardening or the car. Appears to be of high construction to last for years to come. Great design and makes a practical gift for anyone."
3,56 pocket bucket boss,"I been using this type of tool transport organizer for 16 years. It doesn't have several full length pockets inside forlong screwdrivers or other tools. The top exterior pockets do not extend the full length of the exterior. There are noopen bottom pockets for things like snips, needle nose pliers, scissors. I'd never carry my drill/driver in the largepocket, or my cellphone in the other.The material seems to be the most rugged of the six or so that I looked at.I purchased my last one (McGuire-Nicholas) organizer from a big box for the same price as the Bucket Boss, but like most thingsthey could not keep the required price point."
5,"Well made, and designed by people who use it","These make a GREAT Festivus or xmas present for the man about the house. I was immediately impressed with the quality and durability of this bucket organizer. It fits snugly over any 5-gallon bucket and still allows for a seat lid to be placed over it, doubling for aseator step and keeping water and dirt out of the interior. If you need a few more pockets or the same organizer for heavy tools, check out theBucket Boss Extreme Gear Bucket Organizer. As for many reviewers complaining about screwdriver slots, I fit mine along the elastic belt at the rim and any others upside down in the slots if needed -- problem solved (or perhaps that's what Bucket Boss designers hope you'll figure out)."
5,Bucket Boss,This was nicer and better quality than I expected....I was very pleasantly surprised!! The shipping time was unheard of too! I ordered online in the middle of the night on a Saturday and it was on our doorstep before I got up Tues. AM!!! My husband was a real happy camper when saw this....I will look at their other products for sure! Thanks!!
5,Holds Everything I Need,"No, the bucket is not included, but I had a stack of them to get rid of anyway. This thing holds just about anything I can think of, to the point that I can hardly carry it. The only suggestion I have is that some of the outside pockets could be deeper, but for under $20, what do you want? It's made of tough material as well and I expect it will last a very long time."
5,More Pockets - It's a Good Thing,"I'm quite pleased with my 56 Pocket Bucket Boss. I'm also happy to report that the Bucket Boss Pro Lid works in conjunction with this product. It takes a bit of juggling around but once you get the tools in their ""special"" place and everything is in balance, it's pretty easy to carry too. Also try the Bucket Grip, it cushions even the heaviest load. I probably have 35 or 40 pounds of tools in mine with no sign of damage to the product."
4,Fairly Impressed,"This is a Made In China item but I am fairly impressed with it's construction. I would have liked to seen more heavy duty stitching but I haven't broken any yet. As advertised, there are numerous pockets of varying sizes and shapes. There are pockets that will fit larger tools, such as hammers, pipe wrenches, etc. on the inside part of the bucket, but become useless for those larger tools if you insert one or more of the tote trays that are made to fit and stack inside a five gallon bucket. In other words, don't buy the tote trays if you need the inside large pockets. Overall, it's a good system."
3,ehhh ...,"I really like to organize my tools. A 5 gallon bucket is a fairly large receptacle - which is nice everything fits in one toolbox. I recommend this type of toolbox.However, upon reflection one of the many similar bucket tool organizers would have done the same thing and for less money."
2,Was good but now ...,"I have been using this product for many years and loved it, but they appear to have changed the interior pocket depth and now the tools fall out. The pocket can't even support a nut driver without falling inward blocking access to the center of the pail. To bad the ruined a good thing."
2,NOT Happy with the Changes....,"I have been using this particular bucket boss for years. I have to replace them every 1-1/2 to 2 yaers due to the abuse I put them through - No problem. However, when this particular batch came in and I put a new one on my bucket, I found that the pockets were much shorter and my longer tools (ratchet, chisels, etc..) were falling over. While the Bucket boss seems constructed the same, I find myself yelling at it in frustration for not holding my tools like the older ones. So in short, if you are going to keep short tools in it, no problem. If you need it to keep normal tools in it, be wary."
5,I love mine!,"Well, I love my bucket boss. First it is always so hard to keep tools in one place anyway. Not to mention having the husband claim my tools as his own and throwing them in his toolbox. Now I catch him with ""Nuh uh uh. It doesn't go there - put it back where you found it...in *my* bucket!"" He's getting the hang of it. So this pleases me no end. I go looking for a screwdriver - it's there; the drill motor - its there; calking gun - oh my! it's there! Since I bought my own bucket boss - my husband realizes I mean business. He can borrow my tools but he has to put them back- in *my* bucket. So the bucket boss has improved my life immensely."
3,I shoulda stayed with the 35 pocket,"Yep, this thing is handy, alright, but they added non-stretch pockets to the outside to increase the number. Bad idea. The pockets are just a tad smaller than on the 35, so there's actually a net loss in storage space because fewer things fit in these pockets. I find that alot of the stuff I used to snug into a pocket on the 35 get tossed into the bucket on the 56 cuz they just dont fit without a fight. If the pockets had just a little bit of 'give' to the fabric, or there were more 'balloon' pockets, I'd claim this was a bigger winner than the 35."
5,more than expected,I do residential electrical work. After using a tool pouch and a tool belt I thought I would try the bucket boss. This product works great for my purpose. I can carry all of my necessary tools to the job site and inside the bucket I place things like junction boxes switches and receptacles. All of my tools are there where I need them and I don't have to dig around in a pouch for them. The only thing I have noticed about the boss is when traveling in my van I remember to remove my drill because the bucket will spill over when the drill is in the boss.
5,Great way to keep your tools together and organized,The bucket boss is a great way to keep your tools easily accessible and organized. The only minor gripe is that it could do with having a couple more deep pouches for long tools - not a big enough problem to stop me giving it 5 stars
3,not what I expected,I thought I was getting what was pictured and described. Little did I know that this was an insert for a bucket. I was totally unaware that I needed to purchase the 5 gal. bucket seperately. I would recommend including the words... bucket not included in your description.
5,Great product.,This Bucket Boss is very well made and has places for everything from your electric drill to your duct tape. It was a great gift for my son.
4,Handy Dandy,"I bought this item for my husband and it is a handy dandy item for those times when he needs to grab a couple of tools for fixing a few small things around the house.He is more organized and less likely to lay his tools down where he finishes with them since the ""Bucket"" is always handy.Highly recommend this item especially for young men just starting out taking care of a home and family."
5,Bucket Boss,One of the best items that I have in my shop to *save steps*...great when I am work in the fields too !!!
2,You need a 5 gallon bucket!!,"From all the glowing reviews I thought that there was no what I could go wrong!WRONG!I expected a nice leather bottomed bucket shaped tool bag.WRONG!This well made, well designed circular belt is made to slip onto a LARGE 5 gallon bucket. The bucket is not included!Also be aware that a 5 gallon bucket is pretty big - not your usual around-the-house bucket but a large bucket (normally white) used for industrial jobs.Maybe this is what you want. It was not what I wanted!"
5,"Great book, better than 'Stark's War'","When I first bought 'Stark's War', I didn't read much of it. I wasn't interested at the time. Recently, I came back, and read the whole thing from cover-to-cover. I was thrilled. It was great.Going through the aisles of my local bookstore the other day, I saw this book. I didn't even know there was going to be a sequel! I bought it immediately, went directly home, and read the book until I finished it, at about 2AM.It was a great book! Even better than the first. I loved it. It didn't have that ""I am invincible! Rarrgh!"" theme from the main characters as lots of novels do, either. I thought it was a great yarn, if a very unrealistic view on the future...... Well, I hope so, anyway.I definately recommend buying this book. Don't forget to read 'Stark's War' first, to get the whole story. It'll read a lot better that way, and the story'll be cooler."
4,Good Second Book.,"This is one book of 3. It's a good story, well written and believable. You really should get all three to get the full story. If you don't read book 1 first, you'll miss a lot."
2,Just Filler,"<Spoiler Alert> Plot elements may be discussed. This author also writes the excellent Lost Fleet series, but under a different name - Jack Campbell. Lost Fleet deals with space naval battles and emphasizes fleet manuevers, whereas the Stark series is viewed from an individual soldier's perspective at squad level. At least to start with in the first book. After initiating a rebellion and assuming command of the lunar base, the grunt now discovers that being in charge is not easy. This book is long on self-doubt, unpreparedness to counter enemy aggressions, and a bit short on action. There were just a couple of action sequences surrounded by a lot of dialogue. As I am nearly done with the third book in this series, you could almost skip this second and proceed direct to the third and not miss much. Overall, a bit slow and the stumbling style of the lead character is a bit tiresome."
1,DO NOT buy this thing!!,"When I got this movie I was expecting another great Troma classic. I mean, how can you go wrong with a title like that. The main actress is ugly as sin and furthermore there is no nudity. This movie does not deserve the Troma logo on it! DO NOT buy this thing."
3,Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell,"Troma is at it again. If you like clay dinosaurs and little dialouge, then step right up. This isn't for the easily disuaded moviegoer. Those who enjoy a few swordfights, puppet-like worms popping from the ground to feast on dogs and human flesh, a severed arm (this happens once),and lizard creatures that make annoying noises, then bring it on. I have to be a little honest, I love horror and it's the simple things that carry me through the hour and twenty minutes this movie has to give. This has one scene of boobage, flat and nothing to do with the plot, and some gore, but it's mostly the adventure that turned me on to buy this thing and keep it in my collection. If you're a true fan, then fork it over, but if you're indecisive and a virgin to the gore industry, then stay away!"
1,IT'LL BORE YOU TO DEATH,PERHAPS TROMA'S WORST MOVIE. IT IS SET IN PREHISTORIC TIMES AND IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN BARBARIAN. ONLY WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP.
2,Pretty Bad.,I am a TROMA fan must admit this one bites. Only one or two cool scenes. Troma DVDs usually get a extra star review because of all the neat cool features they present and offer with thier movies(DVDs) And its not like your gonna get to see this flick on HBO. Plenty of commentary here along with TROMA interactive trivia game. Gotta give it more than one star.
1,truly sickening movie,"The first reviewer is actually right. The story has this Yukuza woman who hires 3 bad dudes to take people out for her. One of the first scenes is when they go to this karate school. Now this is where i have to stop. Only the action in Swordsman with an umbrella could be compared to the badness of this. But then I somehow made it through(fastforwarded) to the end, and OMG i am I sorry I did. Final fight doesn't even have these 3 bad dudes. The finale is a guy against this yukuza woman. IT IS SO BAD!!!!!!!!!!So please do not watch this movie. I found Swordsman With An Umbrella about 10 times as good as this thing, seriously."
1,Shining Star,Hard to follow. Very superficial plot.The only actor/actress with any credibility was the actress playing the Banker's daughter. What action! What dialogue!Has she acted in any other films???I'd recognize Stockton anywhere.
3,pointless,"Sloppy Seconds is a great punk rock band, but this cd seems a little unnecessary. The first 3 songs are from ""Knock Yer Block Off"", which isn't one of their better cds in the first place. I would only recommend this cd to those who just have to have the 2 unreleased tracks. ""Horaay For Santa Claus"" is quite humorous, being the theme from the classic cheesy movie, Santa Claus Conquers The Martians."
3,Doesn't like to stay open.,"Build quality of this bag is excellent and it is fairly light-weight. However, the design seems inherently flawed. If you load up the tool pockets lining the inside of the bag, the weight of these tools tends to pull the bag closed, making it difficult to reach for a tool one-handed, and about impossible to efficiently place tools back into the pouches, so I never end up bothering and pretty much use this as a cluttered tool sack. I just replaced it with a more rigid nylon tool bag."
4,new bag,"good product, had 1 before. the only prblem was the 4inch cut in the canvas on the bottom of the bag.looked like a razor cut. could of happened in shipping.brought the bag to a local shoe repairman and had a piece of leather glued and sewd to the bottom of the bag.was going to have this done any way,because the only down fall to this product is that the bottoms wear away in about a year and ahalf and holes start to appear around the conners and at the base of the screw driver holeders.beside that as an a/c repair man the bag works well and other bags on the market don't have all the pockets and screwdiver holeders on the inside.in short iwould buy this product agian."
4,Perfect size tool bag,"Awesome tool bag. perfect size for drill and other tools that I prefer to carry. Heavy, durable canvas and no problem w/zipper as other reviewers have claimed. Only downfall is that bottom of bag will sag- used 2 pieces of cardboard wrapped in duct tape to keep from sagging."
1,nice bag,It's a nice bag but no support for the bottom. I used to use it at work but not no more. If they make the bottom ridged it would be a 5 star.
2,Poor quality product received.,"Not sure where these tool bags were made, but they're not the quality of the original Bucket Boss bags. Maybe they're knock-offs made by some other company and then sold as the original? Probably should have returned them, but just never got around to it."
3,Needs a Hard Bottom,"The bag is made of heavy rip-stop nylon that will probably outlast me. I don't use this professionally, but I always have a lot of projects in my ""off"" hours. The bag has many nice pockets (though I don't find them very useful in practice) and a sturdy zipper.The big downside is that there is no stiff bottom in this bag, unlike every other bag I've used. Tools all slump to a heap in the center. I'll cut my own, but I shouldn't have to. A minor complaint is that the handle is just a nylon strap. I much prefer the feel of the nylon straps on the 'Ridgid' brand bags which have a stiff cord in the strap. Hard to describe, but it's a nice feel. Ridgid has a nice 22"" and a nice 17"". If you like a small bag, Stanley has a nice 12""."
1,Don't believe everything you read.,"In all fairness, this product may be wonderfully useful for some people out there. However, unlike Amazon's sell copy presently states, as does the product's packaging, it does NOT work on Windows NT. This is not my judgment, although I concur. This is what Syracuse, the manufacturer, told me after waiting forever on hold with their tech department. I'm sure Amazon will refund my money, but I wish to warn other NT users: don't bother."
3,How many times can we hear the same message,"This book has a few good nuggets, but the rest is filled with the same consultant-speak techno-hype that has been played before. This myth of a ""new economy"" should have been destroyed by the dot-bomb, or by the recent accounting scandals, or by the recession. We seem to forget that it is execution that counts. When will we realize that you can't build sustainable competitive advantages through technology. You can build more efficient operations, have better means of collecting, analyzing and using information, and respond in a much more rapid way to stakeholder needs; yet technology is only as good as the fundamental execution of your business. If you want a more enlightening, practical guide on technologies that will make an immediate difference, try ""Going Wireless""; if you want to concentrate on strategic ""blocking and tackling"" pick up ""Execution""."
3,Some good stuff from a consultant,"Have you ever had a consultant come in start off trying to explain what he's doing and you look at him funny. The consultant then goes in and does his thing. A few months later after the consultant's changes have had time to settle, get the edges off, etc. you go 'he had some pretty good ideas' I'm glad we hired him. That's sort of how this book is. In the beginning the author starts off explaining his theory and ideas and you kind of go ""ummm yeah okay"". Then he starts to put it into practice and you go ""okay I see using part of that and some of this would work for my business"" and at the end he brings it all together and half the stuff he said in the beginning was semi-useless, but you can see why he said it, and it comes together and you say ""I can see how this would improve things"". Overall I give the book a StuPage C."
2,Same as 1st book,"Although this book has great material for kids, it is almost word-for-word the same as the first book ""Hot Stuff to Help Kids Chill Out."" So buy one or the other, not both!"
1,Not a good book,"this book is totally innappropriate for elementary children. It seems to only address anger issues, not stress issues. Not every child gets angry when they are stressed. Some are sad, nervous, or scared. A waste of my money. It is a workbook for a middle school or high school student to do on their own."
2,Everything that WAS working...,"The self titled debut effort was one of the strongest CD's in CBA the year it was released. Great, hard driving rock sound; strong lyrics and vocals up to the task. Regrettably, they've fallen quite flat with ""Cut and Move"" I won't go on too much other than to say that the final track ""Reborn"" is almost unlistenable. It's a dreadful and painfully on-target impersonation of Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull (and hopefully coincidental). Does ANYONE like the Tull? Blech. Likewise while I understand the motive behind many of the gritty lyrics, but it's frankly a real buzz kill. Let's try again guys..."
5,Rock that cant be denied,"This is the most underated band i have ever seen.They've been my fave for 4 years runningThis album from the first track to the end is just amazing.It is a some what diferent turn from their debut,but in this album, Josh (lead) has his set members, not hired guys,Chris Pangallo-bass Joe Pangallo- Guitar Zach Simms- Drums, Greg Hionis (Guitar- recently left)Id say the weakest song on the album would be reborn, but it is still a good song. length on the album is a little rough- but, this album should sweep you off your feet."
5,Get it.,"I am the reader from Chicago posted below. I am not Terry Johnston. Although I am his acquaintance, I am also acquainted with other authors whose work I chose not to review. I reviewed his book because I like it and for no other reason."
1,Diehard Civil War buff bored silly by this book,"I am a diehard Civil War buff, and I was absolutely bored silly by this endless exchange of uneventful letters. Sure, the idea of brothers at war is interesting, but the novelty gets old very quickly with this book."
3,Decent,It's a nice looking lamp but not worth the trouble of putting together. It still wobbles. I'll give it points for spreading light well and brightening the room a lot but I wouldn't buy again just to save myself the headache of assembly.
2,Thanks!,Looked all over the web for the best price on this product (a gift) and found it here. Construction is strong and finish looks great. I can't give enough kudos for customer service. I inadvertently ordered the wrong color shade. Sent an email the next day and received a very prompt reply to fix before shipping!
3,"T. Brown ""TB"" is right!","I read this review, ignored it, bought these anyways, and hate them! I rather use my cheapy alligator Target specials than these. That is saying something from someone who used to jump start cars/trucks/semis for a living (worked close to a freeway offramp). The clamps are absolutely horrid and the uneven jaws cause these to move a bit sideways from their ""spinning"" to a stop, if you will, on a short post. These do not place well on both my Optima batteries' posts. When a car won't jump, we can't help but wonder if it is the battery (Mustangs and their dead batteries, you know...) or these cables, so we keep trying to reseat them on the post better, until we can attain a jump. So after the umpteenth time of frustration with these, I am back here at Amazon searching for something better. Slim pickings too. Just basically Colemans. I guess I will try the 2 gauge parrots, but I am wondering if their jaws are too big for shorter posts sitting in the back of a crowded hood."
4,Functional and well built,I've bought at least two booster cables in my lifetime and this is one that is long enough for most situations for my old car.
2,Loads of faux quality,"These cables are made with aluminum wire which has been tarted-up with a copper coating. The jaws are steel, also deceptively copper plated. The insulation on the wire is some cheesy substance that I suspect will crack and fall off within a few years. I would rate these three stars if they were sold as what they were, instead of pretending to a quality that they don't possess. If you need a long set of jumper cables that will start your car, and you don't expect them to last too long, these will probably do the job for you. If you expect quality components and a lifetime of service from the tools you buy, keep looking."
2,Disappointed,Cables are crimped to the clamps. They should be soldered.These are fragile at best. So I'm looking for a better setfor our work vans.Thanks
5,my favorite jumper cable,"i got this one back when my old car used to die on me all the timewhen i finally got a new car i was almost upset that it always starts by itself thats how good this cable isi also have another ( even more heavy duty 2 gauge ) coleman cable but that one is TOO heavy and clamps are too hard to compress. this 4 gauge one is ideal IMHO for a mid-size car. clamps operate smoothly, the cable itself is not too heavy or stiff and power transfer is good.i had a cheap cable literally MELT on me once and wouldn't start the car because it was too thin. don't use cheap jumper cables - go for a nice solid one like this."
3,Good but not Great,"The clamps on these are the week point. The connection between the clamp and the cable is not the best, just some metal tabs bent over the wire. The clamps themselves will not fit on the terminals on my battery. The notch on the clamps for side terminals also doesn't really work all that well. I keep them in my truck for emergency use and they work good at jumping cars, but look elsewhere if you need to jump start a diesel or tractor."
5,Great jumper cables,"They are very sturdy, carry a great electrical charge between batteries, and are very durable. I have bought a second set. Highly recommend."
3,Not as sturdy as I had hoped,"I have two other pair for other vehicles that I had purchased years ago. I figured I'd purchase another set thru Amazon. Based on a lot of positive reviews I thought I'd buy these. After receiving them I was surprised to find that of my three sets, this is the lowest quality of the three. The fist thing I noticed is that the insulation on the wire is much thinner than my other sets. However, the copper wire seems about the same so I'm find with that. However, my real beef with these cables is the clamps themselves. When I squeeze these handles, they open but they also twist as they open. The clamp metal is much thinner than my other two. I also see that clamps do not contain much for battery clamping material.Bottom line, these will work for the (hopefully) few times I ever need to use them but I certainly would not consider them to be heavy duty."
2,Nothing to write home about,These jumper cables are not very good. The wire is Aluminum and the battery clamps are poor quality(steel teeth on one side). You really have move the clamps around on the battery post to get a good connection. The two times that I have had to use them I had to grab a DC current meter to check for current flow and then had to playwith the clamps to get a good connection. Best thing that can be done to this cable set is to cut the ends off and solder on a good set of jumper cable clamps from Napa. By the time you do that you could have just spent $100 on a much better set of jumper cables.
3,A little concerned with no strain-relief for the copper cables,"I just received these cables, and they look fine, except there is no strain-relief for the copper cable at each clamp. The copper wire appears soldered to the clamps, but further back the insulation passes through some eyelets, but the eyelets are not crimped down to provide strain relief. What this means is, strain (bending) of the copper cable will cause fatigue and the copper wire strands will break.For example, take a paper clip or other metal and keep bending it - it will eventually fatigue and break.I considered using pliers to crimp the eyelets, but I'm not sure that wouldn't void any warranty for the product.But, considering how often jumper cables are used for most people, it should be ok. Just be aware, if these get frequent use, they could fail when most needed."
4,Solid quality but price is a bit high,"- Personally, I think price is a bit high.- Cable quality is great. The ""power glow"" clamps did not impressed me though. In fact, sometimes I feel they are not that securely 'bite' on the battery.- 20 foot and 4 gauge is a must for a safe and serious jump-start, do not save money by cutting these."
5,works great--,works great-- made in USA -- half the cost of ones we found made in china. I highly recomend this product.
3,abridged cosi,"While much of the music is clear and true, the sopranos had trouble with the low notes. But my major criticism, is that the opera has been cut in places, without noting that on the description!"
5,Great stuff !!,"If you are interested in conducting serious and professional investigative interviews this is one of the first books you should pick up. It talks about numerous interviewing techniques on how to extract vital information from the person your interviewing without asking ""leading questions"". I got over 5 pages of notes out of the first few chapters alone."
1,Fluff,Ninety-five percent mundane recycled touchy feely fluff and 5% useful information. Not worth the price even for those who would appreciate the fluff.
4,Neat,"I recently brought this for a plane ride.It's cool. KND is one of my most favorite shows.If you haven't seen KND yet,this is what it is allabout:KND is about 5 kids who want to free allother kids from adults.They are: Nigel (''number one'')Hogie (''number two'')Kuki (''number three'')Wallabee (''number four'')Abigail (''number five'')The episodes on this set are:''N.o.p.o.w.u.h.''(The KND treehouse loses power)''B.r.i.e.f.'' (Nigel gets into a fight with talking underwear)''R.e.p.o.r.t'' (Haven't seen it)''D.o.g.f.i.g.h.t'' (haven't seen it)This is one of the coolest games for Gameboy.The picture is a bit fragmented,but that's okay.I look foward to a GBA Video release of anotherGREAT cartoon network show,''The Grim Adventures Of BillyAnd Mandy''. THAT would Rock. GABM is cool. But for now,I'm fine with this. Try it out."
4,Amusing for Everyone,"This is one of those shows that I believe will leave a lasting impression on the youth of today. These stories can be watched on your Game Boy Advance and are perfect for traveling. The premise behind CKND is that these 5 ten-year olds are in a secret organization know as the Kids Next Door, who try to stop adults and their evil ways. Each episode is named as if it were a codename operation. This volume contains... Operation: R.E.P.O.R.T. Operation: N.O.-P.U.W.U.H., Operation: B.R.I.E.F. and Operation: D.O.G.F.I.G.H.T."
3,Miniature missions,"Unlike others, this Cartoon Network Game Boy Advance Video has nothing but ""Codename: Kids Next Door"" episodes.This one has four classic episodes including the episode where Numbuh 2 meets a new high-flying adversary and the episode where Numbuh 1 is being stalked by a living pair of underpants.If you buy this, may I suggest some of the other Cartoon Network compilations as well ? Thank you."
5,Noel Coward in his time,"This three CD set is a very good buy, if you like Noel Coward. The first two CD's are early recordings, contemporary with the writing and when the young Noel could hit those high notes. Also included is a disc of contemporary recordings by other artists of the time. I admit that the sound is scratchy and muffled. I don't care. It's worth it for the authenticity and sincerity. (Two strange words to use when talking about Coward.) No one was better at creating rhymed wit than N.C. Not even Cole Porter. If you are unfamiliar with Coward's work and want an introduction at little cost, here's your chance."
1,Item Substituted,"Beware! The item shipped was not that which was pictured. The ""GateMouth"" bag is a great bag which opens from the top with two pivot points, creating a wide mouth opening, hence the name GateMouth. However, the item shipped was the less expensive (generally sold for $22.50) side opening bag. Not a good thing to do, substituting a cheaper product that doesn't even look like the picture!"
4,Bucket Boss 06048 GateMouth Gunner Bag,Well made and is as advertized. Tight fit for my Milwaukee 7100-20 Round Head 2-Inch to 3-1/2-Inch Framing Nailer. I had to put it in the bag upside down with the Exhaust deflector down and the Workpiece contact up. Keep the end covered to keep the toe-nail claw from tearing the bag.
1,This album is missing the first 2 seconds of the first song.,"The first (and best!) song on the CD starts very herky-jerkily as they left off its first two seconds. What a rip off! It's going back and I'm never buying anything off the collectables label again. Album-ruining mistakes aside, this is not one of JGW's better albums anyway. He sounds a lot more produced and formulaic in this outing than on earlier works (Lone Ranger, Ain't That a Bitch, Real Mother For Ya-I suggest you get them on vinyl). ""I Don't Want To Be President"" and ""Mother in Law"" are pretty decent tracks, and ""What the Hell is This?"" is one JGWs best pieces when the beginning of the song is there. The rest of the album is somewhat weak (but still Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson).I really hope another label reissues this with a better (and hopefully complete) CD transfer."
4,Good purchase,This is excellent. I gave it less than 5 stars because it is far from being advanced. I would rate the level as Advanced Beginner.
4,What does a proffesional video technician needs,"A reference book for everything related to digital video. Students and engineers can really benefit from this book. It has a special place on my bookshelf considering that I'm reading it over and over again. The book explains both basic video and digital principles also covers conversion, digital video processing, video compression, digital audio in video, and digital recording. At the end, for a special desert, it has DVE effects explained just as if you were listening classes at the university."
5,Our economy is not doomed,"In a clear, concise, and down to earth writing style, Meredith Bagby attacks the generation-x slacker label. With countless examples, Ms. Bagby details the influence that gen-x'ers have had on the economy to-date. More importantly, Rational Exuberance provides inspiration for ever member of gen-x to make a positive impact on society."
5,Good treatment of Eratosthenes,"Exciting illustrations keep this biography entertaining -- simply great illustrations of the technology of Greece circa 200 BC. The city of Alexandria is portrayed, complete with Pharos. Beams of light are portrayed streaming down -- well done."
4,Librarian,"This picture book relates the story of Eratosthenes, a librarian, historian and mathematician. Around 200 B.C. As a child, he loved to ask questions and explore science and math. As an adult, Eratosthenes became a tutor to the son of King Ptolemy II of Egypt, where he succeeded in estimating the circumference of the Earth. The author attempts to explain his mathematical concepts in easy-to-understand language however, I suspect that it would still be too complex for young children."
5,Great inter-disciplinary material,"This is an excellent book for students of all ages! The story of the project to measure the earth well before Columbus reminds student that history has myths. Many people not only knew the earth was round but also about how big it was. Columbus ignored this ancient data and grossly miscalculacted the circumference. This book is a resource for studies across the curriculum. Including history, math, and geography in a fairly easy to read format. The age 4-8 for reading level is not accurate. The reading is probably around intermediate grade level and much of the technical information is secondary school level. It is a super adition to any library."
1,A Marred Effort,"This could have been a great book. John Vernon obviously expended a lot of effort to weave the known facts into his novel and to create memorable impressions of each character from the small body of available historical knowledge. But John Vernon's easy slide into vulgarity as he creates the personalities and interactions of the characters was a big disappointment to me. I compelled myself to finish the book, mostly driven by my fascination for the Colorado River basin and its exploration. But being unwilling to contemplate that anyone else might wallow through the salacious bogs offensively dumped into this story, I threw the book in the recycling bin as soon as I was done."
1,Dreadful!,"This was the most irritatingly written novel I've ever read. Not being the type to easily give up on a book, I decided to give it 100 pages to see if it improved; I gave up on page 44, but before I did I scanned pages further along to make absolutley sure. Now, some would argue that I hadn't give the book enough time to develop, but to be frank, the writing was so bad, I had to stop for the sake of my sanity. I was going to put the book up for sale on Amazon.com, but there appears to be a glut of used copies of this book. I wonder how many others felt the way I did."
1,"The Last Canyon, the last book?","One can only hope the the Last Canyon is Mr. Vernon's last book. Flat characters; flat imagery; sophomoric dialogue; silly, forced, disconnected scenes: the genuis here is that one truly celebrates the end of Powell's journey becasue it also coincides with the end of Mr. Vernon's prose. One wishes Mr. Powell's journey had ended 300 hundred pages sooner."
3,get the box,"This is a great DVD if you only want the first four episodes. Instead of buying all of the individual DVDs for season one like my family did, buy the box set of the complete season one instead. You save money and there are more episodes per DVD in the boxed set. Don't waste your money, you get exactly the same thing."
1,RIP OFF!!!!,"What a rip off! When I heard that Season One was going to be released on DVD our whole family was very excited. But now I see they are only putting 4 episodes per disc????????C'mon! If we can get full seasons of other shows in one package, why not ""I Love Lucy""? I am cancelling my order."
1,reviewer upstairs is right,this is ridiculous to have only 4 episodes per disc. dont these people know that we would pay MORE to have more per disc?I'm waiting to purchase till they figure this out.......
1,Should Be In Compact Box Set Like Star Trek Next Gen.,"It's totally unreasonable that the studio is only putting 4 episodes per DVD. One of the things great about DVD is that it took less shelf space than bulky VHS tapes. I bought the box set of the first season of Star Trek The Next Generation. It contains 7 DVD's and takes up LESS than 2 inches wide of shelf space, plus it's nice and organized. All the Lucy fans I know would have paid a premium price for it released in the same format as I just described. Now most of them will be thinking why bother to replace my Columbia House VHS collection when this is going to take up almost as much room. Like an earlier reviewer wrote, if they could do it with The Simpsons First Season, why couldn't they do it with I Love Lucy first season!!!"
4,First Time Seeing I Love Lucy Was This DVD,"I'd seen clips and bits of I Love Lucy over the years but had never seen a complete episode before this DVD. Apart from Lucys clown routine I didn't find the pilot funny but it was still facinating to watch. The other three episodes were all quite funny. I haven't read anywhere why the first episode filmed was the fourth episode put to air (and is therefore on the Season1 Volume2 DVD - my next purchase) but the first episode to air which is on this DVD really brings the supporting cast into the show. Lucy and Ricky work well together but the cast of 4 is what made me laugh, with Ethel and Fred getting some of the best lines. The old radio episode (there is just one on this DVD in which Gale Gordon stars) was just fascinating. I have to admit my reason for buing this DVD was more because I'm interested in ""old television"" than in Lucy, but it was so entertaining I'll be buying at least the next one in the series."
4,Take that Minnie Ha-ha!,"All I have to say is IT's ABOUT TIME, Lucy episodes have come on DVD. I really do love all the episodes, BUT I was disappointed that they put only 4 episodes on the DVD and the Volume one and two they jack you because they use the Pilot and episode 6 as two different episodes,(they one in the same). They could of been more generous on giving you more episodes per volume. All and All I hope they put more on DVD."
5,A tribute to one of the best entertainers,"We are all very sad for the loss of Lucy, she brightened up our lives in so many ways and her comedy is still fresh as it was when she first aired on TV decades ago. I bought this set as a keepsake. Watched it over the weekend with the family and it was great fun. Includes the pilot, all funny and hilarious!"
5,I Love Lucy - who doesn't?,"I love ""I Love Lucy"". Lucille Ball is one of my favorite stars of the 40s, 50s and 60s. When I bought I Love Lucy - Volume 1 and 2, I had no idea how much stuff their was on it. I loved the episodes from Lucille Ball's radio show, ""My Favorite Husband"" almost as much as I liked the TV episodes.The only problem with this is that it is not the complete first season. I would have liked to have seen it all in one package like the ""All in the family - Season One"" or ""M*A*S*H - Season one or Two"". But even for these reasons I give it five stars, because I LOVE LUCY."
3,"Whoever puts these DVDs together, READ THIS!!","We've all see I Love Lucy a million times, so let's make this DVD release something special! Include the orginal show openings on each episode, not just once as an extra. Include the complete episodes, with long deleted footage restored. And include the original sponsor commercials. In short, the episodes on these DVDs should be presented as they were originally broadcast in the 1950s!! Few fans have ever seen them this way. Now that would be something special."
3,An aging Shirai in songs that don't really suit her,"a great lieder singer has to be a vocal chameleon to adapt to the styles of such distinctly different musical temperaments as Schubert, Wolf, and Strauss. Mitsuko Shirai is great in the lyric idiom of Brahms and schumann, but Wolf is too restless, conflicted, and suffering for her. Here she sings an hour of Morike lieder, which contains some of Wolf's psychologically simpler songs, but Shirai smooths them all out, and her long-time accompanist, Hartmut Holl, doesn't apply enough imaginaiton to the fascinating piano parts, which are at least as diverse and conflicted as the songs. Shirai's voice is noticeably aging here in 1997, which isn't appealing, either."
1,Too much going on,"I have had to use this text for my politics of russia course and this is one of the most worst written text I have ever read in my politcal science career. The author continously flip flops between time. He starts in the 80s, goes into now and then flop back to 80s without note. this text is poorly written for those who have no general of idea of Russia. I could hardly read two pages without getting annoyed and bored with the text. The chapters are so jammed packed with information that seems to have such poor organization. Now I see why not too many people have choosen this course, mostly because this text was assigned to it. I have had to read, then reread each chapter just to get a touch of what Remington talked about but to no avail, I was completly bored with the book. After the first 5 pages of each chapter, the pages just seemed to run together. (This is my opinion, no one else to which we are all entitled to our own.)"
5,It really works,Arrived timely and in condition advertised. Would definitely buy from this seller again and the product really does work and is a lifesaver!
5,...nice...,"this works pretty good as advertised...plus, it looks cute...i'd buy again if necessary..."
5,A+,Does what it is supposed to do.I use this in my garage to prevent hitting my Motorcycles and Scooters as I need the car to pull in all the way.
5,So simple but works perfect.,I have a large car and a small garage. I have hit the wall so many times I am going to have to fit it before I can sell the house. I wish I had this simple thing from day one. It was nothing to put together and a great price. A lot cheaper that replacing sheet rock.
2,Park N Place - Not much more than a novelty item,"This item works as advertised, as long as it is affixed to the floor with double sided tape. Otherwise, it slides forward every time you bump into it (defeats the purpose). I bought this from Amazon along with parking blocks so that my daughter could get accustomed to parking her new car in the garage. While my daughter gets a chuckle when it lights up, the blocks provide much more effective parking assistance."
2,Just buy a few feet of string and a ping pong ball,"I bought this because I thought it was a clever idea, inexpensive and was easily movable for different vehicles. Like so much junk made in China these days, it's a good idea ruined by poor quality. My problem was that the lights refused to come on unless the pole was bent nearly horizontal. Pointless, since I would have to be drunk to drive that far over it, and I couldn't see the lights anyway because they'd be blocked by the hood. As the other reviewer said, you don't really need the lights because it jiggles when you bump it, but I can achieve that with a length of string and a ping pong ball hanging from the ceiling."
4,Pretty good,Seems to be doing the job so far. The only thing it does not help with is side to side distance. But for front stopping distance it is fine.
4,"Very simple, but works","My new car just barely fits in garage so I needed something to keep from hitting wall. This is a very simple concept... a stop sign on pole... and it works. When the stop sign wiggles (and it's little red lights flash), STOP. I tend to not even pay attention to the lights, just watching for the sign to move."
5,Fantastic VALUE !!,"I was apprehensive when I ordered this. What can you expect for $20? Well, what a pleasent surprise! This little gadget, with its flashing red lights, which come on when your car bumber taps it, is GREAT !!! If you have a tight parking space, as we do, BUY IT !!"
3,Works Well,Light works well and lights up at the slightest movement. Unfortunately one of the two I purchased required new batteries which were difficult to locate in any store until I identified the equivalent numbers.
4,Saving my motorcycle.,Product works as promised. I like the high visibility and the fact that your bumper is the point of contact. This allows you to back in as well.
2,Cheaper Better Product Available,"This product works OK but [...] sells one that is $[...] cheaper and better built. Also the base of this product is too light, necessitating taping it to the garage floor so that it doesn't move when the car touches it. The Emerson product sold by Solutions works the same way but is much better built."
2,Piece of crap,"This thing is really a piece of junk. First of all I bought two, and everything I am about to say applied to both of them.1. The light does not flash when I hit it with my car (maybe 5% of the time).2. It is extremely cheap and can break so easily.3. The stand consists of two pieces that do not properly lock into each other, so when you are moving it, it pretty much falls apart."
3,Light works sporadically,"A gentle bump or push or even a substantial one on the Park'N Place does not initiate the light. Seems one must shake it fairly vigorously before the light works. However if you simply look for movement of the stop sign it works adequately. The manufacturer needs to work on the sensitively of the light actuator. On the positive side, delivery time was good."
5,Works great!,"Bought this for my mom for Christmas last year, and she just loves it. When my mom-in-law was visiting recently she saw it and wanted one for her garage, so I got it for her this year! It's a great visual reference for parking."
5,Worth buying.,"Purchased one for my wife, so she wouldn't drive our new Honda truck into my bike rack. It's a very worthwhile device. Works as advertised. The flashing lights work well, but would be okay without lights. The base is stable, though very light, and hasn't moved. This will keep items from being damaged. Glad I bought it. I also have the flat yellow mats that are supposed to stop the car, but my wife kept missing them. This is better."
3,It Okay for its design...but I think a tall orange cone would do the same job.,I liked it...but a tall orange cone can do the same job...plus a cone would be easier to stay in place on the ground....for this product...I had to place duct tape on the floor to prevent it from moving when my car makes contact....I think a tall plastic cone will do the job just fine.
4,Good option for parking - purchased a second one for another car,"This consists of four parts. The base, which is plastic, forms an X. There are two metal rods that attach together and fit into the base. The top is a plastic stop sign, that flashes when it is moved. The flashing is neat, but not particularly bright in daytime hours. I like that it's easy to move, you can see when your car is touching it, and it's a lot better to hit this than the wall."
5,$20 saves $2000 and marriage,Spouse recently starting using garage for first time. Due to inexperience parking in garage we ended up with scratches on both bumpers from hitting items in garage and with garage door coming down on rear bumper.PRO: Easy to assembly and relocate when you want to do work in garage. No more scratches.CON: Base is lightweight and sign falls over if hit too hard.SOLUTION: DON'T USE DUCT TAPE to hold base on floor it just creates a long term mess especially if you plan on moving it around.INSTEAD buy a $5 metai 5 pound barbell weight at a sporting goods store and place it on top of base. Hole is perfect for sign post and it is convenient for sign relocation.
5,I know the garage door will close thanks to Park'N Place,"The garages built today are not as long as the garages that were built years ago. My husband and I have always driven small cars until recently. When we bought our Endeavor, it was quite a bit longer and wider. First order of business was re-arranging the garage so that we had room to open the doors. Then we had to figure out how far to pull it in the garage (without hitting the recycle bins) so the garage door would close behind us. We talked about hanging something from the ceiling of the garage, and then I saw the Park'N Place, and knew I found the answer. We parked the car where we wanted it, placed the Park'N Place right in front of the car (in bumping range) and presto! No more guessing about how far to pull up. No more getting out of the car and checking before putting down the door, either. I would recommend this to everyone who has a long car or a smaller garage."
4,Kudzu Mom,"This works great, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the weight. I have an open carport, and it doesn't take much wind funneling through to blow it over. This is easily remedied by placing a couple of bricks on the bottom to hold it in place. I've had no problems with it, and my lawnmower is safe from accidental bumps."
3,"Good, but for a couple of things","I probably would have given this a higher rating, but for two things:1. The lights don't always flash or cannot be seen during daylight ... but you can see the sign move, so I probably just won't replace the battery when it eventually needs it.2. Not tall enough if you are reversing an SUV. I cannot see it through the back window of my Durango (large SUV), nor my Escape (small SUV) until I raised the whole thing using a few bricks. So my feedback to the manufacturers is that they need a taller stick.If you always drive in forward or always reverse into the garage, I recommend the tennis ball on a string method instead. However, if like us, you park both ways depending on the situation, this is an excellent solution. I've bought two and with the above caveats would recommend to friends."
1,junk,"you get what ya pay for, this is a cheap piece of junk,light worked two times,even with several battery changes"
2,Cheap; Electronics Don't Work as Advertised,"I removed the plastic tab to test the stop sign, but it failed to light up. I started to unscrew the battery compartment and it suddenly worked, but would not stop working. Again, playing with the screws on the battery compartment, it turned off. Bumping into the sign with my car a few times yielding ""hit and miss"" results (yes...pun intended). The couple of times the sign did light up, it tended to flash endlessly. As others have mentioned, you don't really need the flashing sign to let you know you hit the post. In hindsight, I should have just done the old ""tennis ball on a rope"" trick. I hope this product was NOT made in the U.S., as it would be too depressing to think we lack the brain power to design and manufacture such a basic product."
2,It takes a big bump to light up,"There are several things I don't like: you must forcibly bump it to get the light to flash; secondly, it uses hearing aid batteries, instead of using greater capacity batteries. If you need to park your car as close as possible to the wall leaving the minimum of walking space in front of the parked car, you're screwed because the device will be in the way of walking in front of the vehicle, not to mention having to strongly hit the thing to get it to blink. So I'm trashing the product; instead I'll use a ceiling mounted device."
4,It really works,This is a great product that makes parking in the garage a snap. No more one car too far over on the other's side. I thought that a light would go on if you hit it but that's not happening.
3,Homebright Park N Place,"Very flimsy construction, hard to keep from tipping over. As far as the wand, plastic is OK but the base needs to be more substantial."
3,Didn't really meet my specific needs.,"I rate this item 3/5 for ""Fair"".At first I thought this was great. However, the little rubber pads underneath the stand eventually wear out and when your car taps the stop sign/pole, it pushes the sign back further and further and further each time you park. This makes me have to readjust it all the time. The light still works and I've had it for about 1 year now. Haven't changed the batteries that came with it out of the box, so that's good, I guess.If the back of this stop sign will be 3-6 inches from a wall then this is a good deal because it will stay still. If you need to stop further out away from the wall, I suggest getting something else cause this flimsy thing won't stay put."
5,Great Item!!!,"What a nice little invention that helps you park your car in place. It's simple, not overpriced and works beautifully. It does what it's supposed to do. You won't be dissapointed."
2,Poor quality and customer service,"I ordered two Park N Place. After assembly, one of them worked with a blinking light when bumped as advertised and one didn't. I e-mailed Park N Place customer service and informed them that one did not work. They e-mailed me back the same day and said they would send me a replacement. I have never received the replacement nor heard from them again."
4,"Park'N Place is cheaply made, but does the job","I bought two Park'N Place devices for use in our two-car garage. It does what it is supposed to do, so no complaints there. Would have preferred something a little less cheaply made, however. But if this device manages to keep my wife from ramming into the motorcycle we have parked inside the garage along with our cars, what's not to love?"
1,Blinking Stop Light Would not Turn Off,"I was very disapointed with this. I put it together and pulled the tab to conect thebattery and the stop light would not stop blinking. With the stop light continuallyblinking it defeats the purpose. I returned it. I assume it was defective. I read the reviews on it before I bought it and it sounded like it was a great product. What I don't understand is that once the batteries are put in, the lights start blinking. How can they not blink with the batteries in. It is impossible for them to go off and then go on when the pedestal is tapped with the front of your vehicle. I am preplexed as to how this product can possibly do what it says."
2,slightly disappointing,The product arrived quickly and was easily put together. The light that was supposed to light up when touched did not work. I filed a complaint and it was answered very quickly. A replacement was shipped which works for the time being. For the cost i guess this is what you get. It now is serving the purpose but I am concerned it will not hold up.
3,Not all that it say,"The device is ok, I only had it for a couple of weeks and the light wont flash when its touched. My vehicle isn't resting on it to drain the battery, therefore its only good to judge your distance."
5,Helps guide the car inside the garage,"Assembly and installation is very easy, just put the unit down where you want to stop the car. Flashing light indicates when you have touched the flexible unit"
5,Wall saver,This has truly been a Wall Saver and Time Saver. I no longer have to get out of the truck and check the distance from the wall. Great product.
1,Naming dropping doesn't help this book...,A book full of cobbeled together dull stories just isn't very helpful.Save yourself some bucks and pass on this loser of a book.
1,Really BAD,"I ran accross this book at a local book store and bought it for a Christmas gift. Being a first generation Beatles fan, I think I know a fair amount about the Fab Four. I found this book to be full of errors. A photo of Paul McCartney with Jane Asher is identified as Paul and Linda. Another picture is labeled as being of John and Yoko. Even a non-fan would be able to see that the people in the photograph are clearly NOT John and Yoko.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,PICTURES,"I say 5 starrs FOR THE PICTURES! The information may not be correct. Truthfully I didn't care as I was in for the pictures. But if you're going to buy it, BUY IT FOR THE PICTURES, not the information!I LOVE THE BEATLES!!!! Oh and this was my first Beatle book when I was about 13, 3 years ago."
1,One of the worst Beatle books ever.,"This book is so full of mistakes (as well as being poorly written and designed) it would be funny if I hadn't had to pay for it. Probably rushed out to take advantage of the Beatles' ""new"" success because of the ""1"" CD, this is one you should avoid."
1,Don't Bother Unless You Are A CPA,"This is an addendum to an accounting text. Dry and Byzantine,it is impossible to read through without going comatose or homicidal. Quite possibly the most disappointing primer I have ever read! This may have value to those high priest of accounting used to forging through the arcane network of complicated accounting phrases. To the layman or to someone interested in learning on his/her own I have only five words of advice: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,Crikey! Not b@@@@d.........,"I think the first scene is best. When the blonde broad gets on top and reaches back and puts his thang in her you-know it's pretty frickin' steamy. Some of the actresses are not hot, but the first scene is very very good and among the best you'll find in the soft core genre... plus in these scenes they are actually having sex... a nice addition to an otherwise 'make believe we're doing it' area of cinema."
1,This review is of Kiddieland not the toy,Buyer beware. Ordered this as a holiday gift. It came NOT from Kiddieland but from Target .....and the invoice in the box had a price of $39.99. So if you are interested in purchasing this toy....go to Target.com
5,Mickey toy plane,I love this toy! I bought it for two children for their first birthdays! They both loved it! Their parents called me and told me it was their favorite toy out of all of the presents they received! I would recommend it to anyone!
4,Big Hit!,"I purchased the Disney Plane Ride-On for my Grandson's first birthday. He loves it, and so did all of his cousins that were at his party.Plus - I ordered it on a Monday & received it on Friday! Great experience overall."
2,How do you turn this off????,This has a lot of bells and whistles but it will not shut off? Cannot find any on/off switch. The only way to turn it off is to take the batteries out. How do I turn it off?
4,lots of fun for little guys...,"Both my sons, 3 and 1 love it. The little one will sit while his big brother pushes him around the house. the handle doesn't like to stay in place but overall, but it's a big hit with my 1yr old that absolutely LOVES mickey mouse right now."
4,Great fun for her but a bit loud for me...,"Little girl loves this little thing. I think its one of the better investment you can make for a toddler. She loves riding it around, pushing it, stuffing it with little blocks and pressing all the buttons. The only thing I would change is the effects volume. It can get a tad annoying at times. Id would be nice to have a volume or off for the sound effects. However, knowing she is learning, exploring and having fun I can easily deal..."
5,Goodbye Everybody!!,"I cant believe it's over! Everytime a new book would come out, id rush to read it now theres no more. My mother bought it for me and i was like oh my lord its over. Well at least ill have a chance to read the ones i didnt read yet. this book was about the members going off to high school and thinking about their friendships. I really enjoyed it. To Ann, thanks for the years of babysitters club books that youve given me and i wish u luck!!"
5,BSC High School,"I love the Baby Sitters Club, recently I've been looking through my old books (my friend got me some original copies at Yard Sales) I haven't read all of them though. I have some of the Friends Forever Ones. WHen i was 6 yrs old the dolls came out and enough though i didn't know who the BSC was, I wanted a Claudia Artist Doll so so bad and I got her for Christmas that yr. I started to read the books but they were too hard so I read the books about Karen (I was a huge KAren fan) I started reading the BSC books but i never read all of them a few new ones a few old ones my friend even got me the Offical Guide to the Baby Sitters CLub! I even saw the Movie (although I was too young to understand or remember!) And I would always think up storied in my head about the BSC Going to High School. I wish Anne would have made one Special Book about the BAby Sitters Club the first month or something of HIgh School. I wish I wish I wish!"
1,How sad,"I was a loyal reader of this series for over 5 years. The first one I read was myster number 8 and I've read every BSC book since then, except for this series. I read the first special and then the first one and realized just how stupid they are. I might get them from the library, but I'm not sure. It's really sad to see the series ending. I know that if she had kept on going with the old series I probably would still be reading it. Good luck in the future, Ann!"
5,The saddest but best book in the series!,"I've been reading the BSC books since 1st grade, and I'm devasated that they're over. I've been hoping that she'll begin a new series about them being in high school, but my hopes have died now, since it's been almost a year since she ended the series with this last book. This is probably the most sad book in the series, but also the best. If you love the BSC books, you'll love this one!"
4,A must have for any BSC fan,"I'm nearly 21 years old,but I just had to have this book. The Baby-Sitters Club series were the first books I ever read, and if you are a true BSC fan, this book is a necessity. It can be a little confusing if you haven't kept up- why are Claudia and Stacey uncomfortable and distrustful of each other? - but it is an otherwise lovely conclusion to the beloved series."
3,Baby Sitters Club fan,"It will be a sad site to see the BSC members come to an end. I've throuly enjoyed reading and becoming a part of their wolrd. They were the good friends I never had. Ann M. Martin did a great job on all the girls and peopel who were in these 213 books, (I own 91 of them my-self). I will be sad to see them come to an end but at least they get to grauduate together, most of them. I have not read the new seris but I would like to own this book becasue it is the last one. Thanks to All the people woh made them happen. Your #1 Fan"
4,All that I Expected,"This book was exactly what I expected it to be. It was shipped very promptly. All I was expecting was an end to the series I devoured as a kid, and that's exactly what this was, so this was a good transaction."
5,Farewell BSC!,"I loved this book. Finally the BSC from the 8th grade move on to high school. They've been in the same grade forever! It was such a good book, the club members matured a lot since their first book. It was weird though, that Mary Anne was totally ready to graduate from SMS, but Kristy (who's usually bold and brave) was scared about graduation and going to high school. I loved their letters and the time capsule. I'll miss the book series."
1,2nd Delonghi to die on me.,"I had the esam 4500 and upgraded to the Gran Dama. It's a little over a year now and the LED display just completely died on me. I live in colorado and to get this looked at costs 300 plus then whatever the parts and maintenance are on fixing the issue. I would think this being a high end machine that it would typically last longer then 1 year. The 4500 lasted just over a year and had to be replaced. I just don't understand how can they charge so much for something and offer such poor life expectancy of this machine. If there was a local place to get it fixed, i'd probably take it there just to see how much it would cost, but about 1 year for the price is a very expensive cup of coffee. Find another manufacturer, DeLonghi is going down hill very fast."
1,Poorly Manufactured,"I purchased my original Gran Dama about 18 months a go. A few months after purchasing it I returned it because the display stopped working. They exchanged it. Now the display has quit again. DeLonghi tells me they cannot help me because I cannot find the receipt. Very disappointed in over $2000 wasted because of their poor manufacturing. Please, consider another manufacturer. As you can see I had repeated issues with DeLonghi."
4,"very good machine, amazon is the best!","this is a great machine. it makes perfect cappuccino and coffee, with very little work. if you can afford it get it. the only reason mine went back is that there are alot of plastic parts inside the machine, that I could see wearing out. At this price point I don't want to see plastic parts. however my friend has had his machine for over two years with no issues."
1,Terrible,"Makes the worst lattes. I describe this as the ""neediest"" automatic espresso machine I've ever owned. It constantly needs something (refill tank, empty grounds, fill beans due to small hoppers, bins and tanks). Highly suggest not buying this model."
2,two duds,"well I do not write reviews so excuse me but I got two duds. This first one the LCD panel was missing lots of elements, so exchanged it. There went really well thanks Amazon. The second one worked for a few weeks and the coffee , tea, and Lattes were great. Then the water stopped working for tea and latte so I sent back. I do believe the second one was a re-manufatured to be fair. So with two duds, I passed on another. Will try someone else's machine.Amazon was GREAT to work with on this, thanks Amazon. Please note rating was for machine NOT Amazon's GREAT customer service."
