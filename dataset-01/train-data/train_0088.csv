2,Typical of it's type,"While my political views are close to Greenlee's, I'm not a big fan of these racial apocalypse type of books. Too much like a reverse ""Turner Diaries"" for me."
4,Confused...,"I bought this book because I heard the title of it plugged in a sociology book. I was under the impression that the whole book would be about a man who worked with the CIA to find out their faults and see what it's like for a black man to work under these circumstances. But then he left the CIA within a few chapters and I was like ""What?"" The rest of the book...? I really don't know what rating to give this book. I don't agree with killing for freedom but at the same time, I ironically understood many of Freeman's decisions. I can't give this book five stars because I don't agree with the overall turn-out of the book, but I would have to give it four and a half because it was a page-turner, interesting, intriguing, enlightening, and educational. This is definitely a clean, tight story with an organized writer."
2,Slow and boring,"I did not know what to really expect from this book. It was painfully slow and boring. It did not grab my attention. It took me a very long time to finish this book, and I only did so because I did not want to waste my money. I do enjoy reading books about the Black Panther Party and other such works, but this one was very disappointing."
5,minigame mania,"Lots of fun and addicting minigames that are doable in normal mode. Hard mode is a little ridiculous. There were a couple of minigames I just couldn't beat, but what are friends for if not to beat parts of games you can't do yourself?Along with competitive minigame multiplayer, there is the classic bomberman multiplayer. I'm a big fan of co-op multiplayer, so this game was worth buying just for the classic battle mode. The classic battle mode allows you and your LAN friends to team up (or compete, your choice) and bomb the heck out of the AI. The AI is pretty good, so it's a challenge, even on normal difficulty. The best part is you only need one card for you and your friends to play!"
3,It's all about the Classic Bomberman,"Classic Bomberman fans will love the Classic mode, and the multiplayer options are awesome! However, I did find the ""Touch"" adventure game to be kind of, well, lame. It held my attention for only a few minutes, and then it was back to classic bomberman. Totally worth it for the classic part alone, in my opinion."
3,Not for Online play,"This game is a pretty fun little game- its just a series of Minigames strung together with little-to-no plot. If you enjoy that kind of thing- go for it.However- I, like most people, purchased this for the chance to play classic Bomberman online. This is where the game becomes disappointing. The online network runs INCREDIBLY poorly, making the game intolerable online. So if thats all you are interested in - STAY AWAY.Hopefully the get this fixed for future releases."
4,Recommend,Aside from a bit of sweetness flavor that would have prefer not to have it was a very good jerky
5,A Marriage Must,"This book was a gift to me from my mother for my wedding shower....I began reading it on my Hawaiian honeymoon. The book offers valuable insight to the interactions of men and women while engaged in a marriage. Through reading this piece I began to understand my husband (whom I dated for nearly 8 years prior to marriage)and his actions. Give and take is a key and Tova doesn't expect anyone to be perfect, she kindly shares her own trials and tribulations with the reader to let them know they are not alone. It's a must for anyone getting married -- all of my currently engaged friends will be receiving this one from me!!"
3,"Good with art, bad if you bought the kit.","This henna book had some of the best mehndi designs for hands I have seen. Most books give you beautiful pictures but don't take the time to explain each design. This book does. The hand art is a must for people starting out.The only bad thing about this book and the kit it comes with is it has the smallest amount of henna I have seen in any kit. 5 grams isn't much at all. Plus, the solution to mix with the henna is a dry crystalized form that doesn't appear to have all natural ingredients. I think this is bad since Mehndi is a purely natural body art. The mehndi oil included in the kit is the oddest smelling of any kit I have bought too.If you want illustrations buy the book but if you want henna buy the Return to Tribal Body Adornment Kit."
2,"Good Book, Horrible Kit!!","The book I found was well informative and was good for practicing, but the kit was a mess. The instructions were very ambiguous and the paste came out frothy and light. Not only was the paste horrible, but the cone aplicator tore because the plastic was too thin and the paste was all clogy. But other than that, the book was great, but i wouldn't waste my money"
1,All Dried Out!!,"I received these tubes of mascara, my favorite kind! They were all dried out! When I asked for them to send me some new fresh tubes, they responded by giving me my money back! They must all be dried out! Don't buy these!"
1,he has a business to promote,"He has an agenda. He is looking for clients/customers for his services. Weiss Research.He wants to sell you Weiss Ratings. Lots of ""warnings"" but short of useful advice. I waited to long or I would have returned the book. I was looking to receive a positive ""look for"" guide lines, with explanations, and got instead a bunch of ""don'ts"". The section on health and life insurance plus long tem care were out of place and in my opinion not useful for someone over fifty. The cover says ""getting unbiased professional help"" not from this book you don't., ."
2,Hype,"Interesting how many of the positive reviews are written by people who take the Weiss newsletter. Why would they bother with the book if they already take the letter? And why would they bother to write a review unless perhaps someone put them up to it? Something smells here. Some need to work on their spelling by the way. Very good money here, for Weis."
2,You could do better elsewhere,"I've made a career of investment and financial services. While much of this book is the same old thing we here on the nightly news report, Mr. Weiss is more about himself and selling books and hyped-up newsletters (yes, he also peddles several newsletters - much inaccuracy and sensationalism) than helping you or I. His team of writers could work for the Nat'l Enquirer - nothing but a bunch of hype, sensationalism and self-indulgence. While this is just my opinion consider it food for thought. I have traveled and worked closely with many top financial experts and mutual fund managers - again just my opinions. Be careful out there !"
1,"If you want sound investment advice, stay away!!!","I don't know whether Weiss is purposely trying to mislead his readers or whether he is so ignorant that he actually believes what he has written. Either way, readers would be best to steer clear of this book. Weiss' conclusions in Chapter 11 on Tax-Exempt Bonds is completely faulty and his 'advice' in that chapter is so off-base that it should be deemed criminal. In fact, it would almost be worth giving up our right to freedom of the press to get garbage like this off of the shelves - less people might be hurt. In my opinion, Weiss is no different than any other dishonest advisor trying to make a buck selling you bad advice and ignoring cost - he's just packaged it differently. God help anyone who takes his advice to heart."
1,Too much exaggeration!!!,"This book reiterates what had happened in the past.Magnifies the bads and evils. Held back the goods.There are many fine American corporations and world class CEOs,and they had increased our wealths during past few decades.Of course there are rotten apples in any society, andonce in a while these rotton apples must be clearedso that they do not affect the good apples.Hold-up high the American spirit !!!"
5,This book is a real eye opener,I found this book to be very imformative. It gave me insite into the games and lies wall street has been playing and using to mislead the general public. I am going to act now and protect my capital from what surely is going to be some of the most difficult times ahead. This book is one the best investments I have ever made.
5,Brilliant Marxist Historiography!,"Um, a few observations are in order. Firstly, Marx's critique of history, economics, and society must not be confused with the later activity of Lenin, Stalin, Mao, nor Ho Chi Min: just because they used Marx as their point of departure does in no way diminish Marx's project. Secondly, Hobsbawm is a Marxist historiographer--not a Marxist per se. Thirdly, the period 1848-75 witnessed some remarkably convulsive and important events: 1) the Crimean War [Britian burned on the Black Sea], 2) the Dano-Prussian War [Prussian victory at DÃ¼pple], 3) the Austro-Prussian War [Prussian victory at Sadowa], 4) German unification under Bismarck, and 5) the Franco-Prussian War which resulted in the spectacular German victory at Sedan, the collapse of the Second Empire, the Paris Commune, and the establishment of the Third Republic. Need we say more? Get the book."
3,The Golden Age of Capitalism,"After the collapse of the Revolutions of 1848, Europe as a whole was pretty quiet until 1914. Economically, however, the period is divided by a serere economic downturn areound 1875. This book covers the first part of this period, when European and American Capitalism grew strong.Since Hobsbawm is a Marxist, he's not much of a fan of this period, but his coverage of it is quite evenhanded and honest. Again, as in the first book, he's challenging to read, but worth the effort."
5,Quick and Easy,I heard about the book from a couple friends and found it at the local library. It was tattered and decided I wanted my own copy and purchased a used version through Amazon for $2. I started at the easiest level as the book explained to and thought it was too easy. Now that I have progressed I found it more of a challenge and have also got my wife doing the XBX version for women. It is a great workout in a small amount of time and the exercises are in an order that make you feel stretched and strengthened. I recommend the book to anyone and if you think its easy in the beginning look forward in the book and see what exercises you'll be doing in the future!
3,Rediscovery 2000,"I just found my battered copy of the 5BX and XBX Plans for Physical Fitness developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1960s or early 70s - with an introduction by Roger Duhamel, Queen's Printer. I am not likely to neglect these exercises again. I carried the original book containing precise exercise instructions with me wherever I went - and then no more. Now after dealing with years of sciatica only three days of these exercises seem to make a difference. Don't miss out on 'How to Begin' and 'How to Progress'. Gradual muscle build-up is the real secret here and redeveloping overall physical capacity. The first half of my book is devoted to ten tested exercises for 12 minutes a day for women; the second half consists of five tested exercises in 11 minutes for men. How about a reprint of this valuable small book? Perhaps with up-to-date comments by its original researchers and authors? RML"
5,Exercise made easy,"I used to watch my mom use the Royal Canadians to exercise and get in shape. I found her book a while ago and have been using it ever since. I thought that there was no way it would be enough to really get me in shape. Boy was I wrong! I didn't realize how well it worked until I had to hike up a mountain. I find that it really works your legs and abs, the parts most people want firmed the most. My husband is a real fitness buff and used to make fun of my book, now he just says how in shape I am. I think an updated reprint would be great!"
5,oldie but goodie,"I used the plan for women in the 70s, when I was in my 20s, and it was great for quick workouts without the expense of suiting up and driving to a gym (I combined it with walking). In my 30s, 40s and 50s, I did other things -- running, aerobics, etc. At 60, though, returning to the RCAF exercises, plus walking and yoga is once again a good, no-cost way to stay in shape. I was surprised at how low a level the plan expects a 60 year-old to attain -- perhaps it reflects earlier times. I've surpassed it with ease, and gone on to the exercises for younger women."
5,Excellent - for any ability,I wish I could get another copy. I haven't had this for a few years and I am waiting for another printing.
5,This toy is GREAT!!!,"I love Chelsea's real eyelashes! She is very pretty!!! I love her costume and her second outfit, too. Chelsea's dog Churro is very cute. I love this toy and if you like my scene you should consider buying it. Chelsea is my favorite my scene and is the prettiest out of all the other dolls."
5,hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,what if we like bratz and myscene!???????????????i do!!!!! chelsea is sooooo fab! i have her! i collect Masquerade Madness dollls and flash back fever bratz dolls!!!!!
1,bratz are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better,my scene is ugly they suck bratz rock my scene are for low class hil billies screw ya'll my scene fans.
1,ugg....,"How vulgar. These things are simply horrid. Get bratz, they are at least appropriate, unlike these cretures. Ugg, they act like bold, vulgar animals."
1,Mattel is more of a copier,"Mattel copies everything the Bratz do. And the Bratz dolls did sort of copied Barbie dolls, but they don't copy them in everything. Unlike Mattel who copies everything MGA does. My Scene dolls suck. And I can't wait for MGA to sue Mattel. The world will be a better place when that happens. This doll is ugly, she looks like a belly dancer. So not appropraite for little girls. My Scene dolls are slutty ugly dumb dolls. brazt dolls are prtty fashionable great dolls. Get a Bratz doll intead."
5,THIS DOLL IS GREAT,THIS DOLL IS GREAT! I am a Bratz and My Scene fan. Bratz are funky dolls and My Scene dolls are classy. So don't be hating on Bratz or My Scene!
1,CHEALSEA,U KNOW THE MY SCENE R UGLY CUZ THEY JUST COPY THE BRATZ THEY R UGLY BRATZ R NOT UGLY! WHY R U LIKE THAT UR SO BAD TO SAY THAT DONT DO THAT AGAIN OK UGLY MYSCENE MAYKS ME ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,NOT TRUE!,"Bratz did NOT cpy My Scene, My Scene copied Bratz!! The doll, Meygan, was out WAY before Kenzie, and then My Scene copied her, using Kenzie. Bratz aren't bad. They are only bad if you make them bad when you play dolls. And they're clothes are cool! And doesn't My Scene have removable feet? I always thought they did too!!! This ""Mermaid Diva Chelsea"" isn't very pretty. I don't hate ALL My Scene though. I luv shopping spree and the new Birthday Club. You have GOT to look at those dolls!!! Birthday Club Chelsea looks so much better than this and so does Nolee and Barbie AND Madison. They all look great in Birthday Club. So...what are you waiting for???!! where it says search on Toysrus.com, type in ""My Scene Birthday Club"" and you'll find the best my scene EVER!!!!!!!!Thank you sooo much."
3,I love her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Chelsea is a great girl!!she has long hair & pretty banges!!!!she also glowes in the party pad at night!!!I like mermaids so she is perfect!!!the only thing I don't like about her is that her hair tangels easly!!But compared to some other dolls she is not the prettest!!I also like her dog he is a mermaid two!!She looks good in the party pad!!!I also thinks she has a little to much makeup!!All the Masquerade dolls have real eye lashes!!!She has cool acceseries two!!I think Myscene dolls are alot better than Brats Because the Myscene dolls dress a little more appropriate!!!She is Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Barbie n' Bratz!!,My Scene is lovely NOT! I just don't get who would buy such an UGLY DOLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,grow up!,"i just wanted to say that my scene is 1 million timesBETTER than bratz, their clothes can be worn by otherbarbies and i bet bratz clothes CAN'T!"
1,my scene fan??,"idont like the `masquerade madness my scenes.i would also like to say that i am a MS fan but latley i found something that proves my scene did infact copie bratz. on answers.com ""MyScene is a line of Barbie dolls, meant to be more modern and trendy than normal. They were created by Mattel to combat the direct and growing threat of Bratz dolls.""yep it proves it :( im so sad"
5,Wonderful!!!,"I think this toy is sooo wonderful. The My Scene girls are so durable! They come with the cutest stuff, and provide people with alot of imagination. Bratz fans always come here just to make peoples feelings get hurt. Being mean to us doesn't tell us who WE are. It tells who YOU are. You being that rude is just showing everyone how rude you can be. That's not good. I think all my scene doll fans should stay on the my scene reviews, and all the bratz fans to stay on the bratz reviews. A war between dolls is stupid and pathetic.Please stop the war. That's the last thing we need right now. Just everyone use your brain, and stop arguing and threating people over dolls. It's horrible.ANYWAY, Overall this doll gets 5 stars. I love the concept of it."
5,"Bratz are ugly, and you know it!","This is for whoever said that ""at least bratz heads aren't too big for their bodies like my scene"". That person obviously can't see that well, Bratz have a huge head along with their huge feet and they have the tiny - est body I have every seen. Plus when you take off the bratz shoes, they have no feet, all that is there are 2 little pegs, which make them look even more retarded. That is just my opinion, But My Scene are very pretty and look real (what bratz are lacking in). I have the masquerade madness chelsea, and I love her! I also have the masquerade madness butterfly punk barbie and dream genie delancey. Plus 10 other my scenes'. And for the ""kids"" stop fighting over bratz and my scene, if you don't like my scene, then DON'T WRITE A REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! these reviews are for my scene lovers, like me!!!!!! Get a life Kid! Move on..."
5,WAR OVER WAR OVER,"Everyone keeps going on about how my scene copied bratz..yeh i agree BUT bratz also copied someone aswell.....Blythe, search for them and you will see how much they are alike.....so why dont you all (...) and let people enjoy dolls....I like both my scene and bratz!!!!!!!"
1,YES!!!,"Finally! Someone who understands me! My Scene is SUCH a cheap imitation of Bratz! The fact is that Barbie was ruling the toy world until Bratz stormed in and took over. I mean I don't know but I think that Barbie felt THREATENED by Bratz and thats why they created these My Scene barbies. Personally I say it's about time someone came and started a new line of dolls. Like, honestly no one over 8 really bothers with Barbies. And I mean look at the choices we have: Barbies(in general), Diva Stars, Flavas... Bratz... ~What else?~ and all of them well... kinda suck...But thats not the point. Some people actually LIKE My Scene(I can't imagine WHY though) but Bratz are obviously superior(in SO many ways) so I suggest y'all keep your opions to yourself if you're not gonna tell the truth. :-]"
1,Hmmmm,"Well, now i know what the ugliest doll thats ever been created is-My Scene! They're soo lame and they have little feet (May i also add they copy the Bratz in many ways)Here is a list of things Mattel copied from MGA entertainment:~Big Lips~Removable feet~Style~MoviesSee what i mean??? Kenzie=Meygan Nolee=Jade Madison=Yasmin Barbe=Cloe"
2,Disappointment,"My sister got this doll. I think it was WAY too expensive and the accessories were flat out boring. They didn't even use the masks! If they are going to have masks, I think they should have bendable arms. I HATE the shirt. When we bought it, the shells weren't covering where they were supposed to.I gave them 4 star education because of the movie's message.After watching the movie, I thought they should have made a Delancey doll. She is such a reject and her outfit was cool. The movie wouldn't be the same without her."
1,Ewwwwwwwwwwwww,"If your gonna get a doll like that at least cover up more skin. And what is up with her dog? I think the classic Barbie doll is good and nice quailty, but now the mattel manufacturs think girls like these freakie lookin' dolls.sickning-not pleased AT ALL! =^("
4,good survey and reference book,"There's not much I can add to the editorial reviews. It's a handbook, it's comprehensive, if you're a serious participant in the field you ought to make yourself familiar with this book. It's 27 chapters of personality by the big names in the field. Seven chapters on ""Theoretical Perspectives"" (psychoanalytic, cognitive, etc.), 7 on the ""Interface with Other Fields"" (biology, genetics, social psychology, etc.), and a slew of chapters on ""Research Topics"" like gender, the unconscious, and personality change. A great reference book; a good survey."
1,SGH-C417,"It's not as solid, sturdy and strong as the original Samsung product. If it drops once, it breaks."
2,broke,"This phone clip worked great. I appreciated the very low profile and simplicity of use, then it broke when I caught it on my car door. Now I have a more robust phone holster. Definetly worth the penny cost though, might just want to buy 50-100, to get you through the life of the phone."
3,War After the War,"Rebecca lost her husband in the Civil War. Her brother lives in the west and she decided that she would move west. She leaves Vermont for Independence, Missouri and buys a wagon for her trip. She must be married to leave with the wagon train. She marries Clay Fraser in a drunken state of her doing. The sparks fly. However those sparks ignite a love between them. Can a Yankee and a Reb resolve their differences? By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,Best add on for high end strollers,"this is by far the best add on accessory for higher end strollers. for some reason, most high end strollers do not come w/ parent bars, why the cheap strollers all do but not the better, more stylish (so more expensive) ones dont i have no idea. i used this on my Maxi-Cozi Foray & it saved the stroller for me - i was about to get rid of it because it has almost no easily accessable storage space. the handle bar was angled at about 45 degrees which means the storage caddy was too but after a little fiddiling it got it to be relaivley level & was very secure/stable. i never spilled my starbucks - who would stroll w/ out a capped cup i have no clue. the caddy holds everything: keys, phone, wallet, extra paci, hand sani & pack of tissues w/ room to shove more little items. love it & have given a few as gifts w/ great thanks."
5,Does not work with BOB Duallie,"The quality of the product seemed to be great, but I will be returning it because it didn't even come close to fitting on the handlebars of my BOB Duallie. Maybe I just didn't read other reviews closely enough - I read at least a handful of them & didn't see it mentioned anywhere that this caddy is for SINGLE width strollers only. Bummer - I guess I'm stuck buying the twice-as-expensive BOB version, since Jolly Jumper doesn't seem to make a double stroller version. Just wanted to make others aware!"
3,Not for Joovy Caboose.,This fits on the handle and it seems to be a very well built organizer but for the Joovy Caboose the handle bars are nearly vertical and the organizer sits at a odd angle making it not very useful and also it hangs down and gets in the way of the toddlers who want to enter and exit the rear platform.
4,Reasonably priced organizer,"This fits on the double city mini stroller and works but does not lay flat like the picture because of our handlebar. We like the middle zippered compartment which is great for keys, phone, etc. The bottle holders are for small bottles so if you have a large recyclable water bottle, may not fit. Overall, think it's a good value compared to others."
2,"Meh, it's okay - pretty flimsy","I bought this to use with my Jeep Cherokee stroller. Just needed a place to set my drinks, keys and phone when we're out. Unfortunately it is very flimsy - doesn't fit tight at all as shown in picture. It kind of droops in the middle so that when there is a drink (just one) it tilts sideways. Also, if the canopy is closed (pulled back) on the stroller, I can't reach anything in the caddy."
3,does not fit double strollers,I know most of the pictures are single strollers but the item description does not mention single or double strollers only says it fits 'most strollers' We have a double instep safari swivel and the velcro had to be stretched so far that we weren't confident it would even hold 2 drinks without coming apart from the weight.
4,does the trick,"It does not fit as well as in the pic but it does hold my water bottle, sun glasses and keys with no problem. And I can fold and unfold my Peg Perego P3 while it is on with no problem."
4,Nice little caddy,"I purchased this to use with a Graco stroller that has neither infant tray or parent cup holder. Item arrived today and I tried it out with things I'd typically place in a cup holder. Caddy blends in with the stroller and will be able to hold all the small items I'd like within arms reach. I like the zippered compartment as well as the outside slot pockets where I can rest my cell phone and I pod. At first I was looking for something plastic thinking it'll be more sturdy, but I like the fabric as it does not add adittional bulk and will not interfere with folding. I also dont mind that company's name is on it. Cant be the price or the free shipping! Thanks again Amazon!"
4,"Flimsy, but does the job","The picture shows a very snug fit. Maybe for other strollers, but not for the BOB. It does the job, but it's definitely very flimsy. However, the top pouch closes with a zipper so I'm not worried about losing anything. And for the price, I can't really complain as opposed to the alternative which was double. So I would say, good, but not as illustrated in the photo."
4,Use it with our uppababy vista,"Pretty good item, especially for the price. Love that it has two spots for drinks / bottles and the zipper."
5,Fit my Phil and Ted verve perfectly,"This parent organizer can hold two big bottle really good. I like it a lot. It has space for one or 2 diapers, small amount of wipe, phone, key. The phil and Ted accessory is so expensive, so I choose this one instead, and it looks really cool on my verve."
2,it's ok for some strollers,"I have an UPPA VISTA, the handle bars are at a 45 degree angle with no bend in them. The Jolly Jumper fits on the handle bars but the bag also sits at a 45 degree angle. Basically, this would work if I always carried around a drink with a cap on it but never an open container. If you have a stroller that will hold the bag level it will probably work better for you.Aside from the angle of the handle bars, I wasn't thrilled with it in general. The cup holders are not large enough to fit larger coffee cups or even larger water bottles. There is nothing that really gives the caddy any structure so the bottom part swings while the top stays rigid, making things bounce around. I tried this caddy head to head with the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy (which is cheaper) and found that caddy to be better material, better structure and the cup holders stretch to hold larger cups."
5,stroller caddy,This product is great and we use it everyday. No more spilled drinks and everything imaginable fits conveniently in the organizer.
5,Is soooo much better than the uppababy cup holder!,"I have the Uppababy Vista and was fed up with the Uppa cup holder b/c it really stinks and bottles literally fell through the chains onto the sidewalk all the time not to mention that it made the stroller even wider. So, I got this one and I really like it. And to address other people's concerns about it not sitting level - if you adjust the straps properly it does sit level. plus the weight of a bottle in it makes it level. i love that it fits a bottle for me and a bottle for baby and has a spot to hold your cell phone. And it's so inexpensive. I def recommend it."
3,serves it's purpose,"This caddy serves it's purpose--its not outstanding, but it does a good enough job. I would have liked it to be of a more stiff fabric, like neoprene so there isn't as much motion on heavier items like drinks. I haven't tried a fast food cup yet, I fear that might spill given the angle my drinks sit in this caddy. Also, my hands hit my water bottle just by being on the handlebar. It may just be the Peg Perego Aria stroller though."
4,Quatermass 2: Superb British Science Fiction,"Certainly the best of the best of British Science Fiction film. This film is often diffucult to find on DVD so it was nice to see on Amazon. I was also pleased to see commentary on the DVD as well.The pace of the film is fast, and the special effects are very good even by today's standards. Watch the skies! And if you see a small pod fall from the sky, by all means do not pick it up!!"
3,Microscopic aliens invade in football sized ships.,"Microscopic aliens arrive on Earth in hundreds of football sized ships and take over the bodies of unsuspecting people. Their goal is global domination at the expense of the human race. Duh! Unfortunately, they run into Professor Quatermass and their plans are foiled."
2,Overrated,"I got this video after reading the various viewer responses and found it tedious. Britain has provided us with some terrific Sci-fi movies despite low budgets, but this one has all the tension of an uncooked sausage and generally looks pretty silly - the costumes are dated, the characters cliched, and the ""monster"" is too silly for words. I place this film right down there with the worst of American 50's black lagoons!"
4,"AKA ""Enemy From Space""","Well I remember the afternoon I sat as a ten year old, glued to the TV, mesmerized by fear, as this creepy story unfolded!! I can only add my two cents' worth to the above excellent reviews of this 1957 (and wasn't THAT a great year for SF movies?) gem: (1) The score by James ""The Devil Rides Out"" Bernard. I think a CD is available of some of his film music, including ""Q2""....Wonder if ol' Bernard Hermann saw this movie before he scored ""sycho""? (2) The ""...H U M A N P U L P !!"" scene towards the end in the control room. O that the modern movies left more to the imagination!!"
4,Excellent Paranoid Science Fiction from Hammer,"One of Hammer's relatively few sci-fi thrillers, and a sequel to the Quatermass Xperiment, this film is a minor classic of cold chilling paranoia. Adapted by Nigel Kneale from his classic BBC serial, this film has a basic premise similar to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but taken into very different directions. Not to give too much away, but the joy of this film is not in watching the alien plot to take over earth unfold, it's in watching Professor Quatermass uncover the already widespread conspiracy. Photographed in beautifully stark monochrome with a great pseudodocumentary approach, Quatermass 2 is a great example of the sort of sci-fi/horror hybrid that became popular later with films like Alien and, along with the other two films in the series and the sadly unavailable The Damned, one of Hammer's best attempts at science fiction."
5,Quatermass 2 DVD,Got my product in a timely fashion and I have no complaints. I think it wonderful that Amazon made this title available again after it went out-of-print from original manufacturer. I wish they would do the same for all the other Hammer titles that are still OOP. The quality of the DVD is excellent. Any buyers who complain are stupid and should be ignored. - JB
4,Good Hammer sci-fi,The movie is very good for the most part. Hammer has expanded on the first Quatermass movie with great results. It can be a little talky and slow at times but there is always a sinister atmosphere of evil throughout the film. The ending is very good.
5,Quatermass 2,A good classic. A must for all SCIFI fans. It is amust for all good collections of SCIFI when they where well written and inosent.
5,5 stars for quatermass2,"Very fast delivery.Thanks to amazon and the company i ordered quatermass 2 from.This DVD is impossible to find anywhere in the louisville,KY area.This part of the state seems biased agaisnt Horror/Sci/fi/ classic films and i am very pleased with the services provided and very happy to have this movie in my collection! I will for now on use Amazon and all of the distributers to order these hard to find dvds.THANKS!!!"
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"It is an impressive looking coffee maker - featuring all the things I was looking for, and it was on sale. The 1st thing I noticed that I didn't like was the water level indicator--if you only make 4 cups its hard to tell the amount in the reservoir. I use a measuring cup and somehow when the coffee is finished I seem to have more than I poured in! I learned that this pot uses 6 oz. cups for measure, not the 8 oz. as on my kitchen measuring cup. When I adjusted the water/coffee ratio I found that it does make good coffee. The stop-drip feature for when you pull out the pot before its completed it's cycle doesn't work very well. There are still a few dribbles. The clock/timer feature is easy to use, and the coffee making is done quickly. I would probably not buy another one. I'll probably save this one for the church yard sale next summer."
2,Not a sports bra,"This bra is very lightweight and thin. It is comfortable but I would not call it a sports bra. It offers no support, and is so thin that you might as well not being wearing a bra, if you know what I mean."
4,"E,E,Cummings fan","If you enjoy E.E.Cummings, you'll enjoy this. It's one of those fairy Tales written for children, and best understood by adults!!"
4,A new favorite,"Take a lovely Christmas poem by e.e. cummings, add in beautiful illustrations by Doborah Kogan Ray, and you have a new addition to your Christmas traditions.Two children find a little tree and bring it home. They take care of it, they decorate it, and they love it. Little tree became a symbol of Christmas in more ways than one.Even though I am an avid reader, I avoid poetry. I usually find it over my head or melodramatic. (Poetry is one of the reasons I chose not to become an English teacher) In this case, Deboray Kogan Ray's illustrations have taken the invisible meaning of this 90 year-old poem and brought it to life for me.I have really enjoyed reading this book to both of my boys this Christmas season. When I pack up my holiday decorations, I will carefully put this book, along with The Night Before Christmas into the box, so it will be there for us again next year."
4,"Great Illustrations, story is very e e cummings","Cute softcover book. The illustrations are beautiful, but if you are looking for a story for a child, this may raise questions you did not intend - like where are the adults? But I suppose if you are reading e.e. cummings to your child you must be prepared for such questions."
5,Adorable Story,"I love EE Cummings. When I saw that they turned Little Tree into a book, I had to get it to share with my son. He read the book first and we examined the pictures as we went through. The very last page (on the back) is the poem in full so you can see the spacing that is common of EE's work. I read the poem to my son in full the way it was meant to be read and he just sat there imagining away."
4,Very Good,I have read most of the Sammy Keys books. Out of the ones I have read I don't think this one would be at the top of the list but I really do like this book. It has a lot of suspense and you really don't know whats going to happen next! I am sure you will be able to read this book quickly because it is a real page turner! Real dangers are in store for Sammy! I definantly reccomend this book to anyone who has read any of the Sammy Keys books before!
2,Must capturing a child's voice mean bad grammar and cumbersome phrasing?,"As an adult and a writer, I can't get past the first few pages of this. It's so badly written, I constantly find myself editing it in my head. Obviously, the style is intentional and designed to capture a child's voice but many books are able to do this without such lousy sentence structure. The main problem is that it is written in a style of oral language, including a lot of unnecessary ""fill"" words and conjunctions. If you're a teacher who cares about the written word, I'd highly recommend steering kids to a different series!"
4,Where's Sammy in here?,"I have read all of the Sammy Keyes books, and I personally think that this one was the worst. It wasn't in the present tense like the other three were. It was a good book, but I didn't instantly want to read it over again, like I did with the other ones. The Curse of Moustache Mary had better have more of the old Sammy in it! Read Sammy Keyes and the Sisters of Mercy for a really good Sammy book."
2,"They know the formula for good music, but don't apply it.","Peplab has good rifs and solid beats, but instead of flowing into one fun album, they scatter and leave the beat in pieces. Their synthesized lyrics are clearly inspired by Daft Punk, and yet even more loopy. It will give them props for having an original sound, but originality doesn't make the album sound any better.Personally I feel like I'm shopping at Old Navy when I hear this music. It sounds remarkably like the genre of Muzak the store aims for, to smother the yuppies and high school cliques as well. This is exactly the type of thing echoing throughout the mall -- that spunky, yet completely forgettable noise that occupies the space. You may not, however, hear the track ""Pornstar"" in Old Navy. In this case you'd be shopping at A&F.;It's not a bad album, but nothing to recommend to a buddy. Some people like this sort of synth-bubblegum pop melange. If that's you, then you might just enjoy this. No guarantees though."
4,Kennedy has his finger on pulse,"I greatly enjoy Kennedy's light poetry. I'd like to find a published copy of X.J.Kennedy's ""Old Men Pitching Horseshoes"" Anyone know where I could find this?"
2,Too flowery and doesn't last long,"I thought ""Tuscan Vineyard"" would be, well, like a Tuscan Vineyard. This one is like smelling a cheaply scented candle. I won't be buying again. Plus, it aggravated my allergies, which is not usual for fake scents."
4,I love Albert King,"Very good, stage directions should have been edited out. I as actually hoping to replace a cassette titled Roadhouse Blues I had from the 80s but it's not available as a CD"
4,Great read.,"This was a great little story. Set in the romantic, tropical setting of paradise I immediately liked Julie but could not for the longest time understand what she saw in the conceited, arrogant Ruel Chandler. But he softened up somewhat and in the end I was rooting for they're love,"
4,Old school at its best,Sounds of Success is what this band gives you in this CD. I love the old school brass sound and these guys give it.
1,why only the second hand Materiel..?,"For TABU Record Please Everybody from the TABU Company...? how many more Years do we have to Wait for the proper Album releases with ORIGINAL 12inch Versions between 1982 - 85 and there B- Side Material...? Please Stop your Stupid ALL THE TIME ""Best of releases "" with no Original 12inch Versions....? If you cant do the JOB leave it to somebody more Qualified...?

Hope somebody is listening....? Cheeery Red record PLEASE BUY the TABU Company....?"
3,great CD just scratched on the one song I wanted,The songs on the CD are all great but as a DJ I had a request for a certian song off of this cd to be played for the bride and groom. unfortunately the song was scratched and could not be played. That one song is hard to find and I had the other songs already so I waisted $10 the wedding is over and all is forgiven.
5,If you love old-school R&B and 80's Funk-YOU GOTTA GET THIS!,"I am only 20 years old but when I first listened to this album, I fell in love...This band has many intricate beats and a melody that everyone can dance to...no wonder many artists are sampling from their great work...I love all the tracks especially, ""No Ones Gonna Love You"" and ""Tell Me If You Still Care""...Jimmy ""Jam"" Harris and Terry Lewis made a name for themselves when they produced this band...they have developed a distinct style of their own, with their creative ideas, the S.O.S became a great band...if you want to get an excellent CD to reminisce and dance to...""Take Your Time, and Do it Right"" by buying this album...."
4,I will order it again,"My heart doc prescribed this for me and I could not find it anywhere locally,,,but went on line to my favorite shopping venue (Amazon.com) and alas, there it was. I have been very pleased with the product and will certainly order it again for as long as my doc prescribes it's use."
5,Page after Page,"An encouragement to treat writing as your lover - a passionate and inspiring book that encourages writers not to give up. Brimming with useful exercises to help you get started and keep going, this book is a must have if you have any doubts about yourself as a writer."
3,Predecessor to Chapter after Chapter,"""Page after Page"" guides the writer from the first blank page through to the final completed project, from the first resistance to the reward of completion. The book includes 54 exercises and hundreds of tips for success. Heather Sellers provides practical advice for the beginning writer.Seller's approach will attract a limited audience. This is not a book for casual, perfunctory reading. It will take a dogged person to commit to the discipline and dedication necessary to follow these exercises. However this will enable the diligent to reap the most benefit from the book.Although Sellers writing style may appeal to some, it did not resonate with me. I found the exercises and suggestions in her book ""Chapter after Chapter"" more helpful to me personally. If you enjoy ""Page after Page"" you will want to add both books to your writing reference library."
4,Great book for new writer's,I love this book. It helps you to figure out what you are doing and where you are going in your writing life. It helps you sort out what type of writer you want to be and gives good tips on how to succeed.
4,A compilation for various occasions,"Whether you are an alumnus searching for your college fight song, or a sound booth technician for your local Pop Warner League, this CD is perfect for all people. I myself am a high school student who is sampling fight songs in hopes of coming up with one with which i can switch some words to create a new school fight song. This has all the favorites, from such sing-a-longs as ""Rambling Wreck"" and ""The Victors"" to the classics and standards like ""Fight The Team"" and ""The Notre Dame Victory March."" Plain and simple, this CD has the college fight songs to fire up any crowd."
3,Forget Cal Fan For Life,"uses a review of a compilation of fight songs to take the opportunity to bash UCLA and USC's fight songs. Gimme a break.Other than that, the recordings sound like old versions of the song, which might sound off to people who aren't familiar with how the song was played 50 or so odd years ago."
4,Great collection but.....,".....it is missing one of the greatest Fight Songs in the history of college athletics. The University of Central Florida Fight Song is one of passion and glory, and watch out, this is THE institution of the future!UCF charge onto the field, With our spirit we'll never yeild. BLACK and GOLD we'll charge through the line, Victory is our cry! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y. Tonight our Knights will shine!U-C-F Knights! UCF Gooooo Knights!"
1,Roll Tide Roll,"You messed up my Alabama part. How dare you! Roll Tide. How dare you. If you do something like this you distort everything pure and heartwarming. How dare you. The CD was of poor quality. How about getting different band to perform different songs because the U of M band were not with the actual rhythem of the original bands. Poor, poor job."
1,The Greatest College Fight Songs,"Your only sample was the Star Spankled Banner, I know what that sounds like. It was the other selections that I would be interested inb"
3,Meh,"I thought that most of the selections were well done, but there were many flaws. USC's fight song? Their fight song consists of three notes played in the same order over and over again. Though I love that Fight for California showed up high, I was annoyed to see UCLA's fight song which was brutally ripped off from Cal's ""we three sons of california"". And the recording was absolutely awful."
2,Greatest college fight songs,"The music on this CD was not very good. The renditions of YEA, ALABAMA and BOOMER SOONER were played at too slow of a tempo.The AGGIE WAR HYMN was totally butchered at the end. Another thing wrong with this CD the omission of the MINNESOTA ROUSER and the SEMINOLE WAR CHANT. The renditions of ACROSS THE FIELD, NOTRE DAME VICTORY MARCH and FIGHT ON, USC were the best on this CD"
5,"Very good, The Victors is beautiful!!","Yes, good thing it had the Victors, but where's Michigan State's fight song? I grew up to that and love it...where is it? The CD is a great value, but better value if it had the MSU fight song."
3,Fine Album,Lacks the fire and emotion of the Greatest Marching Band ever the University of Michigan. Still worth listening to some fine arrangements.
3,"Good, but ""Touchdown! Favorite College Fight Songs"" is better","Before you buy this CD checkout ""Touchdown! Favorite College Fight Songs"", performed by the Florida State Marching Band. It's much better. Several songs that are missing on this CD are not missing on that one. ""Touchdown! Favorite College Fight Songs"" is also for sale on Amazon.com. You'll especially like FSU's CD better if you're from the south."
3,Music tempo sounds a bit slow compared to live,Listened to the highlighted #2 selection for University of Alabama. Sounds a bit garbled and it is the wrong song. What played was music for the University of Florida. Oops!
3,The way the list should be,This list and compilation of college fight songs around the country is a disgrace. Oregon State University??? Give me a break! no one doesn't even know where that rookie of a school is.The list of songs on this CD should be1.) University of Michigan's 'The Victors'2.) Ohio State's 'Buckeye Battle Cry'3.) Ohio State's 'Fight the Team'4.) Univ. of Texa's 'Fight Texas'5.) Univ. of Iowa's 'Iowa Fight Song'6.) Univ. of Florida's 'The Orange and Blue'7.) Arizona State's 'Maroon and Gold'8.) Univ. of Southern California's 'Fight On'
1,good collection of fight songs,"You left out the Texas Fight Song,one of the best if not the best college fight song."
5,Fantastic,"I first discovered the ""Rutshire Chronicles"" of Jilly Cooper while studying in Scotland. This fifth volume in the series is just as witty, fast-paced, and hilarious as the first four--with all the sex, snobbery, and drama you could ask for. All the best characters from the earlier books make at least cameo appearances (Rupert, Helen, Taggie, Rannaldini, etc.) and the new ones are great as well. Hardly a horse, but the classical music theme is not the slightest bit boring (despite my total lack of enthusiasm for the genre). Jilly Cooper easily buries Danielle Steele and the like... This book can be read by itself, but even though they are hard to get her I recomend getting ahold of the earlier books (Riders, Rivals, Polo, and The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous). As a final note, the whole Marcus sub-plot is great!"
3,Fun shop talk; Jilly's stock characters in a new setting,"This is a fun book and a page turner. There's lots of interesting information about symphony orchestra musicians. For instance, I learned that musicians applaud by banging their bows on the backs of chairs. It was interesting to see how Jilly took her stock two dimensional characters from a horsy setting to a classical music setting. We still have the spoiled female brat, the too good to be true martyr, Snidely Wiplash, the rich working class character with a heart of gold, the rich working class character who is awful etc.I would urge Ms. Cooper, if she continues to put American characters in her books, TO GET AN AMERICAN COPY EDITOR. No American would use the phrase: ""Sounds hell."" to describe a dreadful person. This is one of many such errors.Jilly, I like your books so much that I hereby offer said service gratis. It would be worth it to get a pre-publication read of the book."
5,echinacea,I can't imagine surviving the winter colds and flu season without this product being handy in my family medicine cabinet.
1,Somwhere between Freeman's vitriol and an ameteur' s efforts,"I was the Medical Director of American Samoa a few years after Mead's sixmonth in Ta'u, a village in the Manu'a group and spent over two years there. On my trips to Manu'a I found and talked to Chief Tufele and those Mead worked with. With two years study of Hawaiian I was able to converse with them quite easily. Mead studied Samoan for only six weeks in Pago Pago.There are many errors and self-projections in the work of a 23-year old girl fresh out of college on her first field trip, but not enough to incurFreeman's wrath. About half of his criticisms are not true."
2,Slow,This book would have been much more understandavle and readable if the author had followed one or two girls through the cycle of growing up. It seems to be random information that does not come together very well to reveal the true culture.
3,"This book is not all about sex, fyi","When my professor for Anthropological Theory passed out a list of books to choose from for an essay we had to write, I snatched up Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa the moment I saw it listed as an option; I'd been wanting to read it almost since I started becoming seriously interested in studying anthropology. Really, I don't think an introductory level class exists that does not bring up Mead and the controversy surrounding this book.So what's it about, and why is it so controversial? ...For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"
1,Proven Hoax,"Poorly researched book, which is completely wrong on the facts of Samoan adolescent behavior, as subsequent scholars have discovered. Mead had an agenda and goes to Samoa to prove it. Some people just can't accept the truth!"
1,Might be funny if it wasn't meant seriously.,"The credibility of this book has now been destroyed- see ""Margaret Mead and Somoa"" by Derek Freeman for proof- most serious academics now see this book as an emberassment, a bad joke perpetrated by an eager to please twenty three year old neophyte in the grip of ambition and groupthink. A heady mixture indeed Ms. Mead.... The noble savage you say? The malleability and innate goodness of human nature you say? History now points an unwavering finger and pronounces you a liar. What a shameful legacy."
4,"Mead, though questionably, raises many cultural questions","Though Meads research was questionable in terms of its accuracy, the observations she makes of Samoan and American cultures caused the anthropolgical world of the time to rethink itself and reorganize its ways of doing things. This book will cause one to reflect upon a society's culture much more deeply and look for the things within that culture that make it truly wonderful."
4,Came really quickly,"I ordered from Bellweather.I had an issue/question and through Amazon, messaged bellweather, who replied within a day. the package also go to see within the time they said it would. good service!"
1,STILL MIS-LISTING THIS PRODUCT,"I usually look at the customer reviews. This time I didn't. Anyway, if you have read the other three then you know that Restock It will not send you the projector it is advertising. I didn't receive the mount, like the others. I just didn't receive anything except an email saying that my money was being refunded and listing ""Account Adjustment"" as the reason. Save yourself some time and effort and avoid dealing with restockit."
1,Incorrect Description,When I originally purchased the item the description was for a Epson Moviemate projector with built-in DVD player and screen. When I received the item it was a projector mount. I contacted the seller and was told that the description on Amazon was incorrect and that the item number was a projector mount on their catalog. I then requested a refund since that's not what I thought I was buying. In any case the seller apologized for the mistake and gave me a full refund.I was little disappointed but I'm happy I was able to get my money back.
1,BEWARE!!! ITEM IS NOT EPSON MOVIEMATE 25,I HAVE TRIED TO ORDER THE EPSON MOVIEMATE 25 TWICE THROUGH COMPANIES LISTED ON THIS PAGE. THE PAGE IS LISTED AS THE EPSON MOVIEMATE 25 BUT IN FACT BOTH TIMES WHEN ORDER IS PROCESSED AMAZON HAS YOU DOWN FOR A EPSON PROJECTOR WALL MOUNT. BOTH OF THE COMPANIES HAVE VERIFIED THIS AND SAID THEIR ORDER WAS FOR THE WALL MOUNT AND NOT THE PROJECTOR (WHICH THEY DO NOT EVEN CARRY). I WROTE AMAZON TO VERIFY THE SECOND TIME I ORDERED TELLING OF THE FIRST SITUATION AND THEY APOLOGIZED AND SAW THERE WAS AN ERROR AND CANCELLED THE ORDER. THE PAGE HOWEVER HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN DOWN. SAVE YOURSELF ALOT OF DISSAPOINTMENT AND DO NOT TRY TO ORDER THIS ITEM FROM HERE OR TAKE A CHANCE AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE THE LAST DEALER ACTUALLY HAS THE PROJECTOR. I WOULD WRITE THE DEALER FIRST AND ASK OR YOU WILL END UP WITH JUST A WALL MOUNT.
1,Sad,"I was looking forward to hearing these cds for some time... The Wonder Years would have been nothing without those poignant songs, which enabled us to actually feel the same emotions that the characters were feeling... This is where I discovered the beauty that is JONI MITCHELL and she's nowhere to be seen on any of the cds!!!!Don't waste your money or your time."
5,BY FAR THE BEST GOSPEL SINGER ON THE PLANET!,"His voice is amazing. Has a duet with Fred Hammond called ""miracle worker"" thats great (not on this cd). I've been a fan of Rance's for a long time. This group goes way back. Everything they sing is wonderful. He is defintely gifted with an annoited voice!"
4,"Nice,but second time lose in quality a bit","Nice,but second time lose in quality a bit...So I think not for multiple rec,though + is that its metal tape so its going to last 10 years"
3,It is OK,These DVD were Ok. They are what one should expect. It was nice seeing the matches which started the sports entertainment craze but the matches were so dull compared to more recent matches. It was good to remember the old times.
3,Growing Pains,"Its nice of WWE to release all of the Wrestlemaina's on dvd. I ordered just the first three volumes because I have all the Wreslemaina's put out on dvd before this set came out. I kicked myself for paying over 50 dollars for a couple Wrestlemaina's on dvd, but they are worth it. The first five Maina's are alright, but have some growing pains. Matches range from plain stupid to amazing, but amazing is few and far in between. You wont see alot of gimmick fueled matches like today. Meaning ladder matches, iron match, etc. I wish they'd release Survivor Series or Royal Rumble in a complete set like this soon."
2,Missing footage!!!!!!!,"The fourth dvd tells u too flip it over and continue watching, the footage never showed up. It shows up as ""Disc Error."""
3,Piper's Pit on Wrestlemania V is edited,"Just to let everyone know, the Piper's Pit on the Wrestlemania V DVD in this set is edited. When Roddy is dealing with Brother Love, it immediately cuts to him talking to Morton Downey Jr. So you won't see Roddy pulling Brother Love's skirt off and humiliating him. It's really too bad since I find it amusing."
4,Not your typical review...,"I can't speak for actually seeing this movie. I bought it as a gift to complete the series of movies for my mother. She did enjoy The Hound of The Baskervilles, and I sought out the DVD of the movie, and found that there were 4 movies in all. This one was new and in VHS format, so I transferred it to DVD to complete the 4 DVD set. My mother did enjoy Matt Frewer's version, as she has a plethora of Sherlock Holmes movies on DVD ranging from the early 1930's to these movies."
5,"Twists of Fate, Tales of Glory","Son of Perdition beckons to our innermost yearnings. Happy children, new beginnings and young love give way to the unthinkable, inescapable destiny of a young man haunted by his father's sins. Timothy Jacobs, son of Moby Dick's Captain Ahab, refuses to believe the damning account of his father's last voyage. Isaiah Starbuck, son of Ahab's fallen first mate, vows revenge. Happy playmates in childhood, these two young men journey together yet apart, as both search for the Way to lasting peace. Vivid nineteenth century characters, alive with integrity, mystery and raw emotion, blossomed in the fertile descriptions of Nantucket's whaling era, the Naval Academy and the Civil War. Louise Gouge has masterfully woven together the classic fiction of Moby Dick with this Christ-centered historical novel, and she peels away the characters' religious faade until finally, the simple, precious message of the Gospel emerges."
3,DIfficult to Understand,"This book was so well reviewed I felt I must purchase it to add to my large collection of spiritual study books. Honestly although I am well educated and well read, I really don't think my understanding of Jeremiah or his impact has advanced much. The quotes and verses at the beginning of the chapters are very inspirational but the chapters don't seem to tie in well to the selected verse/quote. I am going to try to read it again in hope of getting more benefit but at this point, I have not found this helpful other than inspiring me to read more of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible. It's rather ironic that I am reading the Bible to understand the related study book!"
5,Awesome!,"Love this book that I'm reading. I've never completed reading Jeremiah straight from the Bible cos I find it very heavy stuff. But after reading Run with The Horses, I'm beginning to appreciate this weeping prophet. I'm still mulling over those chapters that I've read and look forward to turning the pages still. Very sobering stuff in there for personal reflection. You can't ignore what you see/realise in yourself."
3,they must of had fun making this one,"Lots and lots of marijuana plants get distributed and grown in this movie directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, father of Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Maggie and Jake appear in this movie as well). John Lithgow (Cliffhanger, Footloose) gets iced at the beginning, making Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade, Monsters Ball), Ryan Phillippe (The Way Of The Gun, Antitrust) and Hank Azaria (Tv's The Simpsons, Dodgeball) in the dust without a boss. So they get rid of the body and things start to smoke up, literally. Funny and serious in most places but it's let down by a unfinshed ending. Kelly Lynch (Road House, Virtuosity), Jamie Lee Curtis (The Fog, Halloween), Jon Tenney (Fools Rush In), Ted Danson (Cheers, Creepshow) and Matt Ross (PCU, American Psycho) are among the rest of the cast."
2,Terrible. Terrible. Terrible,"This movie is just too cheesy for words. It wasn't very funny, nor very exciting, nor original. The only thing is that it involves the marijuana business. In the States this may be enough to call a movie smart and witty, in Holland we like a good story."
4,Good movie,I really liked this movie. Billy Bob is a fave of mine and he doesn't disappoint in this one. The whole cast was great.
4,PASS THE LEFTY ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE,"Tragic that "" Home grown"" was only shown for basically for no more than a few days in very few theaters. Cast includes amazing actors such as Billy Bob Thornton, Hank Azaria, Ryan Phillippe, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ted Danson, and John Lithgow, and Jon Bon Jovi. It was a dark comedy which has suprises of violence combined thrilling moments. Its not a ""Pulpfiction"" type classic, but certainly worth veiwing. It was very difficult to see all the weed beeing burned at the end. Which was the most devestating part of the movie. Great to have ''Homegrown"" on DVD!"
4,Not another teen drug flick,"First of all, THIS IS NOT A SLAPSTICK DRUG MOVIE ALA CHEECH AND CHONG. I found this movie to be more of a drama/mystery than a comedy, and a very enjoyable, compelling, well-produced one at that. Sure, the plot revolves around the harvest and sale of a 'Green' crop, but the scenario that the characters are placed in and quality of the acting and direction is far from the slapstick drug comedies that I don't need to mention here. Parts of it reminded me of Fargo, in fact. With the head of the farm out of the picture, its up to the harvesters to negotiate the sale of the year's crop, and it turns out that the business side of the industry is anything but simple business. The plot twists and turns, the characters cling to their wits, and the excellent direction enhances the paranoia that creeps across every frame of the picture. This movie surprised me: definitely worth a rental."
4,"A good book, but not his best.","The book is about the trek of a group of people taking a gorilla named Amy back into the jungle. The party runs into all sorts of difficulties on the way, including killer grey apes.I thought it was agood book. Some parts are hard to understand, but most of it is easy.I've both read the book and seen the movie, and I definately prefer the movie"
3,Cop-out of an ending,"Congo for the most part is a good read, even though much of the content seems improbable. The worst part of the book is the ""saved-in-the-nick-of-time"" ending, which was a total cop out"
5,"""It was great. I thought I was actually in the jungle.""","Congo is about a group of people (and a gorilla who can talkthrough sign language) who all go to the Congo jungle in Africafor different reasons. Karin Ross, a highly skilled computertechnologist, goes to find her fiance' and a diamond that willput her computer company years ahead of the rest. Amy, thegorilla, comes with her master to be let go where she was born.This book takes you to many heights and keeps you up all nightreading. Sometimes it even scares you. You feel like you areactually in danger from the horendous mountain gorillas. Readthis great book, ""CONGO"", and hopefully you will find it asexciting as I did. The movie didn't do it half the justiceit deserved."
5,tons better than the movie,If you were dissapointed in the movie version of this book I don't blame you. But don't let it take you away from the novel. I read the book way before the movie and it is right alongside Jurassic Park in read ability and worth buying to read several times
4,JUST ABOUT PERFECT,"I loved CONGO, very much. It is extreamly suspensful and well written. It is about a tour guide person named Munro, Karen Ross, from a compony called ETRS, and Peter Elliot, with the gorilla, Amy which he tought sign language going to the Congo to look for the lost city of Zinj where there are specific diamonds called type IIb diamonds. They discover a new type of gorilla on the way and could prevent a World War III with these diamonds. It is funny because of all the ""top of the line"" computer equiptment which they talk about (the book was written in 1980). But anyway, there is a part in the book where everything is lost. EVERYTHING! The team can't take credit for finding ANYTHING. The book got exiting again but I was so disappointed that I dropped the 5th star I was about the give the book. The end also kind of dropped short. You were stuck, you wanted to know more but you couldn't. Besides tese 2 problems, this is one of the best books I have ever read!"
5,Congo--out of the jungle and into your hands!,"I have been a frequent reader of Michael Crichton and I love his unique style and prose. This has to be one of his best works ever~I loved it! If you have a love for suspension and little-known historical facts, pick up this book and let the pages turn!"
4,About the first,"The first review of this book asks why they didn't find the jewels. I don't know if they're aware that this book is based on a true story. The book wasn't my cup if tea, but it was still classical Crichton. Try Sphere, it's better."
5,One of Crichtons best!,"This is one of Crichtons best! Crichton kept me on the edge of my seat as I was reading. I couldn't put it down. The description of the settings in the story were so good, I felt like I was there. The charectors we very well developed and had real everyday personalities. If you haven't read the book or seen the movie, read the book first. I enjoyed the book better than the movie. With the plot that this novel had, the movie could have been as good as Jurasic Park, but it lacked personality.If you like Crichton, and haven't read this one, give it a try, and maybe you'll like it."
2,Interesting setting but rather predictable plot,"I was quite disappointed with this book, though I had heard it was gonna be a great read. The basic story line is quite interesting and the desire to know the reasons behind why things happen the way they do make you read this book fast. Nevertheless the ""destiny"" of the main characters seems too predictable- it's like the heros can't die and this shows from the start. Nevertheless Crichton applies a great deal of scientific knowledge which gives this book a special touch. Comparing the style of Crichton in this book to the one of John Grisham I must say that Grishams books show many more intricate details and tricky-to-follow connections. All in all it's not a book you absolutely have to read."
2,Not Crichton's best work,"I found the story line had an interesting prospect, the fast and furious world of computer technology, meets the Jungle! Unfortunatly as I read more of the book the more bored I got. One of the few Michael Crichton books that I wouldn't recomend"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Backup Lost City expedition, with gorilla.An archaeological and exploitative expedition gets wiped out, and the company this happened to wants to find out why. A young primate expert and her star pupil: a rather intelligent gorilla included, they take what they hope are enough high tech toys for them to survive their monster encounter.An ordinary sort of scary adventure story, really.2.5 out of 5"
4,A Real Winner from Crichton!,"Wow. To be honest, I picked up Congo a little skeptically. I had, of course, seen ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" but that was the only exposure to the works of Crichton I had ever had. However, I found, that after I began I couldn't quit. It is one of those books that carries an air of raw, savage adventure. I haven't felt like this reading a book since ""King Solomon's Mines,"" and that's saying something.My only reason for docking a star from this book is that Crichton sometimes allows his characters to swear and curse, and that never helps a book in my opinion."
4,Jungle of Facts,"The author did lots of research to produce this great work. Lots of facts. I like that, but TOO MANY. When reading, sometimes I would say things in my head, like ""Get on with the story already!"" All those years, names, and events were interesting stuff, but I wanted to read about the ""actual story"" more.I've learned more than I wanted about gorillas in this book. Brief education of animal behaviors and visualizaion of what jungles are like combined with actions and advantures. Not bad! I enjoyed reading it.""Peter tickle Amy."" :)"
3,Don't watch the movie...,"If you watch the movie, you will be disappointed. I read this book and enjoyed it. I don't think it was as good as Sphere or Jurassic Park, but it was good nonetheless.The one thing you should understand prior to reading this, is that the movie doesn't depict how good the book is. I didn't enjoy the movie, and am glad that I read the book first.If you like Crighton, take a chance on it. You might just like it."
3,Congo!!,"Crichton provides us a compelling thriller,with clever action even the characters are average.It can be compared with other novels of Crichton but is not his best work. Those who are interested in Africa will find it an excellent book,with also many details of the technology of 80s.It is a recommended book definitely and too bad that the movie was so bad despite her great special effects."
3,A book,First time I heard about the book kongo I thought its just another stupid book from michael chrichton but i was mistaken.In fact the book reminds on good old days we have to explore the world without any science or explore somthing new something that will pull down your pants and you would wish your mami was here. So the book as itself is very good but it has that litlle mistake.The red dot of the story is lost somewhere in the middle of the book.And the story is to shalow.But anway you can read it if you want to be tortured.
4,CONGO,"I found this book a very good book. The Congo was fairly easy to read except for the computer transmissions. I did not like to read the coputer transmissions because half the time I did not under stand what it said. It was a very suspenceful book. I thought that the book was a lot better than the movie. The book goes into a lot more detail. The first half of the book was rather boring though because it was just explaining everything in detail. Like the facts that lead to what is going to happen. The second half was suspenceful, it keeps you on you toes. This made me want to read more."
4,A great Read,This is a great book and worth looking into do not judge it from the inferior movie. I got into reading all this authors works after I read Jurassic Park. I was very entertained by the story and it kept me on the edge of my seat!
5,Fast Paced and Interesting,"Congo is the story of an expedition going into the Congo rainforest to find a special type of diamond to further computer technology. This book is fast paced, Interesting and has a pretty solid ending. One thing that I noticed is that I was so into the book that I didn't even realize that the last page was 10 pages away. The Mystery the action. Even a little bit of humor. Defiantly one of Crichton's best after Jurassic Park. Id Highly recommend you read this book if you want a change from dull books."
4,Interesting book with unique technology plot vehicle,"Congo, while not Crichton's best-known book, is a good read.Techies will be especially interested in the book becauseof the use of pattern recognition technology.The book, by the way, is much better than the movie!"
2,A bit disappointing for Crichton fans,"I have read three Crichton novels: Jurassic Park, Timeline, and Disclosure, and have generally enjoyed them as compelling, fast moving, and thought provoking. They invariably involve a scientific (or legal, in the case of Disclosure) concept that is extrapolated to create a gripping story, despite somewhat flat characters. Congo, however, was a disappointment. While he builds on two scientific concepts--animal communiciations and evolution--the story fails to grip as it should, pushing him to add some additional conflicts just to maintain some suspense. And while they seemed forced, they might have provided for a satisfying story if only all of the loose ends were resolved at the end. But they weren't, leaving me with a hollow feeling. My recommendation for a reader who has never read Crichton to try Jurassic Park or Disclosure. For those who have, avoid this one."
2,Lacks the element Chrichton Provides,"I read the book some time ago, but I remember not being too impressed with this one. Chrichton's books usually have some sort of science development that make the story interesting, and, what was it computers and communications in this one? It just didn't seem to fit the action (killer apes and volcanoes, etc.) In Jurassic Park, it works (people running from monsters they are resbonsible for) and Sphere (people running from monsters of the imagination) but here I just don't see the connection."
4,quite decent,"I enjoy how Micheal mixes tech. info and action, this novel is nothing like the movie, but it's quite good-Artman"
4,Thrilling technobabble,"This is one of the most technical books I've ever read. In fact, it is so technically written that I hesitate to recommend it--but I just can't help it. Chapters upon chapters of technobabble are hardly wasted because it just seems to be something blocking you from the good stuff--and this book has definitely got all the good stuff. Try as hard as you can to get into it and you'll be rewarded by an excellently written thriller that outdoes the movie in every way possible. If you like thrillers, you'll like Congo. If you like Michael Crichton thrillers, then you'll LOVE Congo."
2,Slower than an arthritic turtle,"This book is duller than dishwater. I was so excited to read this and to my disappointment it was such a dull, slow read. So many pages of experiments that took place 20-30 years prior to the story. the whole build up lead to a great big fizzling finale. I had such high hopes, but hey you can't win them all"
3,Michael Crichton - We'll Miss You,"Michael Crichton was one of the few authors who was smart enough (he graduated from Harvard Medical School) and talented enough to write stories which provided much scientific information along with the entertainment of good characters and excellent story-telling. His imagination knew no bounds and his body of work was spectacular.Unfortunately, Congo is not one of his better works. But he set the bar so high that it was inevitable that he would eventually disapoint some of his fans. Not that Congo is bad, far from it. It's just not up to Crichton standards.It seemed a bit rushed and the characters were not finely developed. The ending will also disappoint some folks. Nevertheless, the book now sells for a very cheap price and is definitely worth reading.Michael Crichton, you will be missed.John E. NevolaAuthor of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II"
4,Movie,"Again the movie doesn't do the book justice. Even if you didn't like the movie, please read the book.Congo begins with a archeological group searching for lost cities in the congan jungles. The group, in order to be found if a disaster occured, would communicate with there base and operation center in Houston via satellite video. One morning during the transmission, something goes wrong. Don't worry I won't say it...(houston we have a problem)...anyway. The company falls under attack by what appears to be gorillas. In an attempt to both find out what happened as well as finding the lost city, another expedition is sent. But this time they take a native...AMY a gorilla who knows sign language. The question on everyone's mind is...Will Amy be enough??"
4,Action packed thriller,"Michael shows again he is the best.It is a story of an expedition to the lost city of zinj.We all know it from H.Rider Haggard's book 'King Solomon's Mines'.In this book main character is played by Dr.Karen Ross and Dr.Peter Elliot.of course amy,the talking ape.this book is all about gorrillas.Anyway it is worth the money"
5,good book,"its a great book, but listening to it on audio book (the whole 3 hours at once) in the dark at 3 AM :-)"
3,Could have been better,"A group of scientists go deep into a part of the African rainforest in search of the lost City of Zinj. The first team of scientists mysteriously gets attacked by unknown primates resembling gorillas. A second team is sent to the Congo (along with a gorilla named Amy, who knows ASL) to find out what happened to the first team and to finish the mission. Parts of this book is very realistic, while other parts of this book get bogged down with too much technical jargon ( wich takes away from the suspence). I didn't care to much for the ending. I found that the author wrapped the ending up to quickly."
5,ACTION-PACKED AND EXCITING!,This is a great book if you like to stay on the edge of your seat! You can never tell what will happen next!Michael Crichton has done it again!
2,could care less,"I know Michael Crichton is an entertaining writer, but I could not get into this book. The subject matter/plot was boring."
4,Congo,"This was another great novel by Michael Crichton. This book starts out quick with the killing of the eight group members, then it slows down to introduce the characters including a gorilla that understands sign language. The gorilla will help them out in the end... They will find some other stuff that they didn't expect to come across including diamonds and the terror that took the lives of the first group of members.Once the story gets going though, you can't stop reading it, you'll never want to put it down. There is a lots of twist and turns that will suprise you. If you enjoy a good science fiction then you will enjoy both the technology and the story. If you don't enjoy science fiction, if you can see past the hubble in the beginning with the systems, you will still enjoy this story. It's a good book for everyone."
3,Well...,"I am giving this book three stars because, while it is entertaining, and far better than a lot of books by other authors, for Michael Crichton, it just isn't up to snuff. If I were going to rate it just based on his other work, with no comparison to other authors, I would give it only one star-- maybe even only half a star. However, compared with alot of the drek that gets published these days and even makes the best seller lists, this book is still a heck of a lot better than most."
2,Definately not Crichton's best,"I could never get into this book, I'm a big Crichton fan, but this is nowhere near his best. If you have nothing else to read pick it up and give it a try, I just plain didn't like it"
4,"Really good, if not anyhing else.","I saw the ovie before i read the bok, the movie was OK, but it made me want to read this masterpeice of a novel. I really liked all the conversatons with that small comuter with the shortened words (For example 'TUF LUK' funny, FUNny, FUNNY!!!) I thought the book was MUCH BETTER then the movie, even if the movie had Bruce Campbell in it. So the next time you want to read about a jungle expedition, you have two choices, watch the really stupid Chef Boy Ar Dee commercial, or read this book. I suggest reading the book."
3,"Good, but a let-down.","I have read almost all of the books by this superb author. I liked all of them. I saw the movie for Congo and I kinda assumed that the book would be remotely like it. NOPE. Well, I guess a bit. The book was too educational. If I wanted to learn about gorillas and stuff, I would ask my biology teacher. But I guess that's the point of books like these : if they didn't exist, we would never learn about gorillas and stuff. My only complaint is the ending, I waited the WHOLE story to get to the gripping and amazing ending like in all his other books. When I finished it last night, I was sorely dissapointed. Well, I guess all books can't be as good as others."
4,"Entertaining, if perhaps a bit far-fetched.","Darn floor. Big bite. So the apes can talk. But who among us would ever pick up Crichton's books to use them for research? This book provides exactly what one would expect: an entertaining, fast-paced story that is based on what is perhaps an outlandish theory. But isn't that what Crichton does best? If you like his other novels, you'll probably like this one."
3,It was OK.....,"The book was pretty good but it felt a little too clumpy, more like a screenplay than a book. I liked Eaters of the Dead better. There was so much fact proofs that this book took me about a week to read when I read Eaters of the Dead in one day. I did liked Amy and how she and her trainer communicated with the grey gorillas so they would not get pummeled to death by their heavy hands holding some heavy paddles."
1,Terrible,"I was searching for a ""light"" but entertaining book to read, and somehow, I decided to pick Congo. Bad mistake. The introduction was promising, I thought it would have some ""realism"", as the author made me believe (he even included more than two pages of references, such as Scientific American and...(yes) Rolling Stone). Big lie. The math is shameful, clearly Crichton has no idea what he's talking about (just as the ""chaos"" theory in Jurassic Park), and other details of the book reveal his careless ""research"" (like the emeralds in Bolivia!). But these are just irrelevant details if you are looking for a novel, of course. What was really bothering was Crichton hypocrisy: in the introduction he wrote about the misconceptions about Zaire (Congo) and Africa and its people, but before the page 50 he made all the misconceptions at least twice. That's shameful, really."
1,Schlock,"THIS is an author who writes ""literature"" according to Amazon's pre-publicity for Crichton's Timeline. Ha!"
2,Seen the movie? Hated it? Here's why,"I actually wondered whether this was the same writer who gave us the fantastic Sphere and Jurassic Park. Congo is really something better left to airport bookstores. The basic story is that a group of scientists complete with an intelligent ape which can sign, travels to the Congo to investigate odd goings-on. At least, that's what we're lead to believe.Instead, the plot meanders around, often going into completely irrelevent sections on computer programming and terrorist activity which has nothing whatsoever to do with the story. The gorilla, Amy, is actually quite annoying rather than cute and the whole idea is a bit unlikely. Finally we meet the nemesis of the Congo - and then everything falls flat. It's not particularly scary and to be honest, it's difficult to care about the characters. The movie didn't do much for this book, granted, but to be honest, it couldn't have made it worse."
2,"Read the book, forgo the tape","Judith Ivy is the worst actress that ever was, and her only contribution to any form of culture is to single-handedly close down any TV show or play she's ever been in, so low sales of the taped version of COngo is guaranteed. Buy this tape if you want to suffer through hours of an affected Southern drawl that makes this Southerner flinch- her only talent is making one vowel into an entire sentence. Read the book or get something who can talk to read it for you."
3,"Crichton, Congo","Congo is a middle-of-the-road Crichton novel in my opinion which is still pretty good as far as fiction goes. This time, he takes us to Africa to investigate what could be a dangerous primitive species captured on video. It has some creepy moments that are memorable and is a bit closer to horror than some of the other Crichton books I've read, but I didn't enjoy this one as much. I have forgotten a lot of it by now and that is never a good sign if you read a novel and forget it. Still, I read constantly and it has been a while since I read this. I remember enjoying it though and I want to read all of Crichton's work eventually so this was one step further on that fictionally educational path."
3,MONKEYS,This book had a lot of compelling action. It was sometimes interupted by alot of unrelated topics that were just there to show that michael knew what he was talking about. It was still a good book that held my interest untill the end. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys the thrill of a jungle adventure.
1,Horribly Written,"I couldn't even get half way through it. Bland characters, unrealistic plot. With too much dated, unnecessary and boring information. The gorilla, Amy, was not even realistic. He made her out to be more intelligent and more capable at signing than happens in reality. I am supposed to believe that the first time Amy was shown a watermelon she signed ""water fruit"" combining the two signs all on her own? Really?What is this, written for third graders?Also, the reality is modern weapons could easily wipe out any apes alive, killer or not. Ludicrous plot. I have concluded this author is a bit overhyped and overrated."
3,"Fast paced, fun, and forgettable.","The search for a special kind of diamond in the Congo uncovers a lost civilization overlorded by murderous Great White Apes with nearly humanlike intelligence. Crichton's mishmash of high adventure, industrial intrigue, and terrifying threat is entertaining, but in the end disposable - the events seeming to have little effect on the characters. Not highly recommended."
5,I now have a phobea of Gorillas!,"Congo is a brilliant book with facinating theorys and wonderul descriptions. You follow Amy the gorilla, Peter Elliot and Karon Ross in suspence as they are hunted by gorillas and travel to the Lost City of Zinj. They discover the horrible secrets of the Lost City and use the strange new breed of gorrilas language to get back home.The story takes place in Congo at the Lost City of Zinj. It mostly keeps to life when it comes to gorillas, but it kind of strays into fantasy when it comes to breeding Gorillas and humans.Elliot studies gorillas and took in Amy a young age. He taught her sign language and she is now almost fluent. Elliot loves Amy, but can sometimes get impationt with her. Ross is very impationt with Amy, and is only interested in the crytle that the people of Zinj are said to have kept. Though she too is interested in the mystory of the City.Over all, the book is interesting and brilliant..."
3,A Good Read,"I thought Congo was a decent book- perhaps a bit too much technobabble and not enough of the gorillas, but it didn't detract from the story much. I wouldn't buy it but definitely check it out from the library."
3,Medias Res book,"Congo is definitley not one of Crichtons best books, but that dousn't mean it was bad. It's based on a true story but its still fiction also. If you think the book is anything like the movie then your wrong, the movie should have been based on something totally different. The book gets you involved with more of the characters and such. I'd recommend this book to those Michael Crichton fans who haven't read it because its a good book but not the best, its still worth reading though so read it."
2,Chrichton disappoints this reader,"I have read a few of Crichton's books, and enjoyed them. This one, however was not one of them. The pleasure in Sphere and Disclosure was the depth of the characters. In Congo, there were so many main characters in the book, that there was never enough time to get to know even one of them; and what I did get to know of the characters, I did not even care about."
4,"Like I said with Jurassic Park, Prey, and Sphere....",This book is very good and very graphic. I liked it though. When I heard the movie was bad I decided not to watch it (even though I have had several chances.) :]
3,Below Average Crichton,"I like monkeys just as much as the next guy but I was disappointed with the number of pages it took to get to the good part. Usually Crichton writes a great first chapter then he goes into explanation then the last 50 pages are awesome. In ''Congo"" only the middle was almost no explanation it was just boring.On the positive side monkeys are cool.On the negative side it was kind of boring."
2,Nothing about Congo,"If you think that when you read this book you will know something about Congo you are wrong, this book explains electronics, volcanoes, weather, etc, about Congo you will read about 20 pages, the descriptions of all the procedures are really boring and if you are not on that field you will not understand, maybe it was a real story, may be not, I really think not."
2,"Ug, me not like!","I seem to be in the minority in not liking this book at all, I was highly impressed by the likes of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, but this book seems to have all the same pitfalls of those with non of the pluses. The technological detail was highly boring (as with JP), I do love imaginative technology in sci-fi, like 2001 for instance, but that is seemlessly coupled with a thrilling story, this is like a textbook in places. As with all Michael Chriton books I have read, the characterisation is weak to non-existant, and unfortunately the storyline isn't elaborated enough to make it interesting. The huge potential of these apes, a relic of a brutal past civilisation is squandered in favour of a cheap horror thrill. I would not recommend this book"
4,A good book that will be suggested to my friends,"Congo is an exciting read. Michael Crichton takes you on a perplexing adventure into the depths of the Congo jungle, where few human eyes have gazed. Truly suspenseful."
4,Good Book,"Congo was a good book with a lot of suspense. I liked it alot, even though some of it is a little far fetched. I am a huge Chrichton fan, and I've read better of his books, but this still rates up there, above many authors books."
5,Where is my $%#&ing CD?!!!!,"Yeah, so I ordered this reissue of two of the best industrial albums to evr be released, on July 19th when it came out. I have yet to receive it. It's August $%#&ing 17th!!! C'mon Amazon, you've sent me three other orders that were placed AFTER this order. This was the reason I placed my order in the first place and it's the only thing i have yet to receive...still hasn't been sent. WHY?! Please please PLEEEEEEEEEASE send me my Pigface CD!!!! I'd give it five stars because I already KNOW the CDs are phenomenal, but I won't YET because I have YET to get them %&*$ing things!!! AAAARGH!!!!"
3,poor product,"pros. good sound, great bass reproduction. cons. noise cancellation bad. Only works at high volume, but any decent headphone will do that. Led light did not work when I first installed battery. Can't tell if noise cancellation is on or off. Very heavy on head and not comfortable. Good headphone for the price even with above problems I found."
4,The first book of a first-rate novelist,"Carol Shields' won the Pulitzer Prize for ""The Stone Diaries"" in 1995. ""Small Ceremonies"" was her first novel, written in 1977. This novel and the next are each about one of the two sisters born to a working class Toronto family. The writing is gorgeously poetic, teeming with arresting, but completely accessible, similes and metaphors. Her sensitvity to nuances of character and relationship is both accurate and moving. Most of us never heard of her until ""The Stone Diaries"" -- but we should have!"
1,Thats 3 hours I'll never get back...,"I ordered this book after seeing the reviews but, not having read any of the authors previous books. I found it dry, not at all engaging and almost silly in content. As someone else mentioned...maybe I should have started with her first novel and moved forward. I was so bored that I found myself dwelling on the four grammatical errors I came across. Happy it was less than $5, including shipping!"
1,absolutely ridiculous packaging.,"I bought two of these, and i returned two. The medicine cabinet is _big_. The construction isn't all that sturdy, and the wood is pressboard. But it's relatively cheap, so i wasn't expecting anything more.However, i did expect the item to arrive in one piece. The box (packaged by zenith, not amazon, though amazon shipped it) has literally half an inch of styrofoam padding. Keep in mind that it weighs in around 50lbs. I don't think there's a single carrier that you can select who would be able to guarantee delivery of this cabinet intact.The first came with pulverized styrofoam padding, two broken mirror segments, a cracked wooden frame, and stapling that had come apart. After returning the first and ordering a replacement, the second arrived in similar disrepair.If you want to pick this item up from a store, then be my guest. It'll probably serve you about how you'd expect. But don't even bother ordering it online."
1,Look for something else,"If you have a choice, look for something else. Thanks Amazon.com to help me out. I was in really trouble with this product."
4,The Haunted World of Ed Wood -- worth watching,"Anyone who has ever seen or heard of Edward D. Wood, Jr. knows what he or she is getting into before the opening credits. ""The Haunted World of Ed Wood"" does a credible job of portraying the man as well as his manic life. Whether it's Gregory Walcotts' condescending nastiness or a funny, insightful Vampira (who, by the way is ""hotter"" at 80 then she was at 25!), I appreciate the inclusion of the good as well as the bad. For Ed Wood fans, this little gem is well worth seeing.At the end of the ""Plan 9 Companion"" the narrator says, ""Ed Wood did his best to make an entertaining film and succeeded-if not exactly in all the ways he may have intended."" I think that says it all."
2,Great Tribute,"I found this documentary to be probably the best tribuye to Edward D. Wood, Jr. available.Cheaply done, prroly written, this documentary was mainly a few of Ed's old friends sharing their memories of Ed and thereby cashing in on their association with him.What better tribute to Ed Wood can there be?"
4,Well made but kind of sad,"Instead of being an Ed Wood movie, this is a documentary of his life. It is well done and presents both good and bad aspects of Wood's character. It includes footage from most of his films as well as interviews with some of the people with whom he worked. These people do not always agree with each other about Wood but, by and large, it is respectfully done.All that being said, I did not particularly enjoy this documentary. I had it so I watched it and have no regrets for having done so. Although it is well done it is somewhat sad. Ed Wood is a figure of fun through his sheer incompetence. Watching the story of his aspirations and dreams being shattered through his own lack of talent was not particularly fun even if it was informative."
3,"Buy this in the Ed Wood box, not as a stand-alone DVD","The Ed Wood Box (Glen or Glenda / Jail Bait / Bride of the Monster / Plan 9 from Outer Space / Night of the Ghouls / The Haunted World of Ed Wood)contains this DVD as well as Image Entertainment'sPlan 9 from Outer Space. Image's Plan 9 includes the two-hour documentary ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion."" The ""Flying Saucers"" documentary is superior (if it were a stand-alone DVD I would give it 5 stars without hesitation). Why? Hard to say, but it just flows better and feels more warm, more intimate, than ""The Haunted World."" If you buy the Ed Wood Box you get them both (in addition to the aforementioned classic Wood films), which gives you plentiful interviews with all of the usual suspects in the Wood Universe. If you're into Ed Wood and his films I'm sure you'll enjoy this DVD...you'll just enjoy ""Flying Saucers"" more."
3,Enter The Wild World Of Ed Wood,"This DVD is somewhat done in amateur styling.It seems almost like a home movie at times.Lots of splicing together of clips and interveiws.however, what DOES save this documentary are the interveiws.Being a fan of Bela Lugosi,I in particular enjoyed the interveiw with his son, Bela Jr.If you love Ed Wood films,I would recommend it highly. If you are expecting good editing style, I would forget it."
2,Looks good but beware when using them,"Twice, when my lamps were lit the glass broke. To keep that from happening, the flame must be tiny."
4,Nice Lamp,Nice lamp for the price.A change from the old fashion hurricane lamp.The glass slides up to light the wick.Oil is stored in the bottom.Quality is OK.I would recommend it.
1,Very poor shipping packaging,"this is a nice little oil lamp. HOWEVER, my original order arrived broken. AND, the replacement order ALSO arrived broken. don't bother ordering this online."
4,A Deeper Love,"It's an independent film with budgetary constraints (by that should be expected with before purchasing). Outside of that, the underlining story of the film is very good and very much relatable to the concept of Christianity. The main character played by (Chyna Layne) really embodies the struggle that comes with accepting Christ into our lives. This film is say to its viewers... You're not just doing what you want to do, hanging with who you want to hang with, and living by certain scriptures that you want to live by. You're surrendering and humbling yourself before God; and changing your lifestyle. It's the best and most difficult decision you will ever make in your life. Some people will have a hard time understanding, accepting and even will condemn the new you that's in Christ!The acting and the film alone is rated about a three (3), but the concept of the film I would rate a 4.5!"
5,LisaP,"Received a perfect copy of this great book that my son has wanted for years. Terrific details on Bionicles, Great book, Like new condition, Great price, received promptly...Highly recommend!"
4,My Review for The Official Guide to Bionicle,"Hi. My name is Nicholas (I feel I should express my first name)and I purchased this book. This is a great guide/picture book of Bionicle. All the pages have full color pictures on them, along with cool Bionicle facts on all the characters up to Mask of Light! I rate it 4 stars because, it is a great book, and it has very cool pictures. Also, you know most of the info if you haven't gotten it until 2004 or something! Great job, Greg Farshtey (writer).From a true Bionicle fan, Nicholas"
5,Official Guide to Bionicle Review,This is one of the most comprehensive books I have ever seen. My 8 year old has not put it down since he got it! He has studied it and memorized every name. I highly recommend this book if you have a Bionicle fan at home!
2,Pretty but TINY,These are really pretty but you can barely make out that they are ballet slippers. They are really TINY. We bought them for an 8 year old. Would have been small enough for a 0-2 year old.
1,Broke before they were even worn,"Bought these in advance as a gift for my daughter's fifth birthday. Was checking them before I wrapped them, and one of the posts fell off in my hand before she even wore them."
4,Great Replacement,My old Garmin Forerunner was without a back charger/ adapter. This was a great replacement. I can use my watch again!
5,game face,I love this movie! it cracks me up every time i watch it. i never ever get tired of it. taste the beast!!!
4,A LARP Lark,"This film was pretty funny. From the LARP satire, to relating to annoying kids (and adults), to the dark humor of 12-step reality and intervention... It's not the sort of comedy I expect to see someone like Paul Rudd doing, which is in part why it comes off as more grown up humor than I generally attribute to Seann William Scott. Jane Lynch characteristically brings the tone up as the overbearing caregiver, though neither she nor Scott are stretching their acting or comedic boundaries. They are basically playing the same shtick they always do--neuromaniac and goofy hornball. That aside, the whole cast is great and its chemistry conveys well, particularly between the Littles and their Bigs. The pitch is still mostly gutter humor, not for the whole family, but it's in keeping with Judd Apatow's smart comedic style. This film is great for lots of laughs and a geeky triumph of the spirit."
3,Expected More,"Not good, not bad. I expected more from the movie, considering the cast. Worth watching once and that's it."
5,Awesome Movie,"Non stop laughing, and the price was amazing on this dealWould recommend to any one who like comedies and laughing"
4,"Good quallity, good movie.",overall nice quality blu ray. Funny movie and a pretty good price. Couldn't pass it up. Starting to grow my BD Collection up a bit.
5,Just fun,"I love this movie, and shared it recently with friends. You're not going to find a piece of deep, meaningful film here - but you will find a quality bit of comedy with great acting alongside a positive message about appreciating people for who they are, not for who you'd like them to be."
5,Lov this movie,"If you have a sense of humor, lov some action, Also if you like alot of sexual situations, This movie is for you!"
3,OK - however,This is a simple and sweet movie but not the best thing out there. Seann William Scott was better in 'The Rundown' and Paul Rudd was vastly better in 'Knocked Up'. Elizabeth Banks was good for the two minutes she was on screen but Jane Lynch was annoying and not up to her best work. I'd give this a grade of C+.
5,Hilarious!,I've only seen this movie on tv. But it always made me laugh so I decided to purchase it. It is even funnier uncensored. Not a family movie by any means. Blu ray looks great.
2,"2.5, Stupid, But Does Have Some Funny Moments","This had a few more funny moments than I expected. Not enough to make this a worthwhile movie, but gave me a few laughs. The whole medieval dress up portion of the movie went on way too long. It became boring and uninteresting. I do have to say it is a little disturbing that parents will let their actor kids (little black kid) say and do things in movies that are completely inappropriate.Don't but this one, but almost worth renting."
4,Funny,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun to watch. People who were supposed to go to jail are doing a public service. Guess what, they are role models to some kids!"
2,This movie is awful!,"What a mess. This movie is disturbing. The simplistic and hackneyed premise, plot, morals, cliche depiction of relationships, not to mention the story that revolves around children and their mentors, would seem to set this up as a movie that only kids and teenagers would find appealing. Except for the fact that the crude raunchy humor and innapropriate nude/sex scenes make it totally unacceptable to show to them. I can't say it any better than this: this is a kid's movie that you would never show your kids because of the sexual content. Top that off with the fact that the jokes fall flat way too frequently, and you've got a complete waste of film and an insult your intelligence. Stay away from this garbage.The 2 stars are for the charming depiction of the SCA/live role-playing spoof portions of the movie which are original and funny."
1,I started to turn it off. This was bad! Very bad!,I am stunned at the Amazon ratings for this movie. It makes me question all other ratings. Oh this was horrible! 10 minutes into it I told my wife this is going to suck maybe we should turn it off. We tortured ourselves! If this is what goes for funny I need to start making movies. Kids cussing is only funny the first time for shock value.
4,Nice Surprise,I went to see this movie with my brother and our cousin as a time killer during thanksgiving vacation. What started as a time killer ended as a very good movie. All three of us enjoyed the movie very much and recommend it.
5,Hilarious Movie,"I thought this was a very funny movie. Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd play well off each other and are quite believable as the loveable losers that have to become ""Bigs"" in a Big-Brother type mentoring program due to court-ordered community service. I also liked Jane Lynch as the head of the program. Her over-the-top sarcasm and self-deprecation was hysterical. It's definitely not a movie for kids because of the language and brief nudity, but it is well worth watching. I have seen it numerous times and will continue to watch it!!"
1,I fell asleep here!!,This was a dumb stupid movie that was uninteresting and not funny. It was so uninteresting that I fell asleep while everyone else was watching the movie. One of the theater ushers had to wake me up and tell me that the movie was finished. My money there that day was all for naught!!!Another movie that is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
1,Candidate for worst movie of the last 5 years,"Even given that we've long since given up expecting anything more than lowest common demoninator, extreme low-brow comedies coming out of big studio Hollywood, this is STILL landmark bad. Why do movies like this get green lighted? Do studio heads figure it will be something their teen kids might like? The kid cursing up a storm in this movie should be offensive at his age, yet the whole movie is so poor, it gets lost in the long list of despicable and insipid things about the movie. I could literally write something...anything ..what I did today...what I had for lunch..a phone call,etc,etc,etc and make it more comedic, entertaining and NATURAL than this forced farce with ten tons of the typical Hollywood super shiney chromed witlessness. One day, the studio's will finally figure out that a handful of funny 1 liners and/or a kid cursing and/or shoehorned plots aren't enough to wad together and call it a movie. An emabarrassment."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,This is stated as a dvd but isnt - they send a STUPID code for iphone or something to that effect. Some people dont have iphone - WILL KEEP talking poorly of this person. Tried to contact but NO response. NEEDS TO BE BANNED from AMAZON
4,Role Models,"Danny and Wheeler, well into their 30s, lack something: Danny feels stuck; he's sour and has driven away his terrific girlfriend. Wheeler chases any skirt he sees for empty sex. When they get in a fight with a tow-truck driver, they choose community service over jail and are assigned to be big brothers - Danny to Augie, a geek who loves participating in a weekend Medieval reenactment society, and Wheeler to Ronnie, a pint-size foul-mouthed kid. After a rocky start, things start to go well until both Danny and Wheeler make big mistakes. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott have good chemistry. A few parts of the plot are contrived. The important thing is the laughs, and this is where the movie delivers. I recommend if you get the chance to see it."
4,Unexpectedly GREAT!,A friend of mine dragged me to the theater to see this one. I really expected it to be quite stupid but it turned out to be very funny. If you like the Seth Rogen crew and movies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad this is a slightly more nerdy but funny one to add to the collection.
4,Great movie and cast!,"Not the funniest movie I have seen, but quite humorous and entertaining. I would totally recommend to buy this. If you have seen the movie Super Bad and liked it you will love this movie just as much! Cast is fantastic!"
4,Give Dogz a chance!,"If you have a DS and have Nintendogs, this game may look like an imitation of Nintendogs. Let me tell you: it's not. Dogz is different in many ways. In the game, you have an avatar character as yourself. There is a much wider range of dog breeds than in Nintendogs, although you can only have one dog at a time. Dogz has good graphics, if you have Nintendogs you will know it's graphics are better than Dogz's. Oh, and there are some other downs about Dogz. Your character has family rules (bedtime, meals). The conversations between your character and their family and friends are very repetitive. I only gave this game 4 stars because the graphics aren't the best, but the game is very cute.And don't forget to read my Nintendogs Dalmatian and Friends review, ""Nintendogs is an awesome game!"""
5,surprisingly fun!,"I got this game for christmas and i was expecting it to be alot like nintendogs. but its not! i've gotten kinda bored with nintendogs so dogz is a nice treat. ""Dogz"" is more cartoon-ish than nintendogs (which are so life like). In ""dogz"" you can pick from atlest 10 different breeds (unlike nintendogs where you can only pick out from like 5 breeds). You can play with the dog for a little while and if you don't like it you can pick out another one. You also have a time schedule.. which on weekdays you go to school and when you come home you take it for a walk, train it, feed it, and have dinner. Then before you go to sleep you write in your diary about your day."
4,This game is good.,"I am 8 years old and I just got this game for Christmas and have only played this for just a few days. This is a very simple game to play. There are no levels.A good part of the game is you can play with your dog a lot, you can take him on walks, play fetch and frisbee with him and you can feed him. He learns his name, and how to sit, rollover and sit up.A negative part of the game is it is difficult to choose the dog that you want. You play with the dog and see if you like him, but if you don't like him, you can't go back to get another dog. It takes a while for the dog to learn to sit, and learn his name and that is half the time I played.I like it and it is a pretty good game so far."
3,Repeditive,"good game, but once you beat it..which only takes a few weeks- a month it's all the same and quite boring. Would never buy agian"
4,REALLY FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game is really fun!first you pick a character boy/girl after that you pick a puppy and name it then you take your puppy home .in a week you take your puppy the vet and get your puppy shots so you can go on a walk i'm going to play on dogz.
2,This game is horrible!,You have to wait too long to do anything with your dog. This game is so boring compared to Nintendogs! Save your money!!! I just got this game for my 11th birthday and I wish I could return it for something more amusing.
5,"Die Hosen are great, even for Americans",This entire CD rocks from start to end. Zehn Kleine JÃ¤germeister is one of the best songs I've ever heard. It replaces the cliche 99 bottles of beer with a modern hard core (and hard liquor) rendition
2,hellow london,"'Sonja at the last', skating in this film better than ever, weak script, skating star ''sonja'' puts on a show for the disadvantaged in London.Black Ice Ballet is beautiful, But poorly lighted. Sonja's presentation on stage, never has it been matched.She gave the ice her all,and made so many happy. ''one in a million'' Sonja was.JoelC.Parks"
1,Misrepresentation Photo,"I just purchased 3 of this item and when it arrived (shipping was okay) the products that I received were not as pictured. The main reason for me ordering this item is because the photo looked exactly like the Ratchet Anvil Pruner that I had lost, which was purchased from a company named Florian. Upon further investigation I realize that the Anvil Pruner which arrived is what is described in the written portion of this ad...however, when you look at the photo, it is clearly a ratchet type of pruner...I am trying to return it to Hocking Valley Supplies, but they do not take direct calls...I can only hope that they return my call."
1,toyota service manual,"quality of the printing isn't very good, explanations are akward, it does not cover certain subjects it says it does and it has some mistakes. Don`t buy it"
3,A good introduction to writing but could have been more comprehensive,"This book gives the basic history of the dicyphering of a number of ancient scripts. It has some nice photos and illustrations. It is not a dictionary or an encyclopedia by any means. It covered the mainstream ancient scripts such as Cuneform and Egyptian, but barely touched on the more ancient,esoteric and mysterious scripts such as ,Neolithic pictographic, Sumerian pictographic, ancient Greek linear A, and the Indus valley scripts. I would have enjoyed it more if it push the envelope a little more."
4,An overview of writing systems.,"A richly illustrated nontechnical introduction to the history of writing. The author briefly touches upon the relationship between language and script and the challenges involved in the classification of writing systems but the bulk of the book is on presenting different families of scripts and accounts of thier development. The sections on extinct writing, such as cuneiform, and on undeciphered scripts were interesting but the book's chief attribute are the illustrations of alphabets, inscriptions, and glyphs, many of which are interpreted for the reader. A similar volume for the more linguistically inclined is ""A History of Writing"" by Steven Robert Fischer. The author, himself not without contraversy, provides the technical precision that is lacking in Robinson's book and has lots of examples of scripts as well."
3,Good on basic concepts but weak on substance,"I have always been fascinated with writing systems. This led me to learn to read 8 different languages before I realized it was the writing that interested me much more than the laguages themselves. That is why I am split in my perception of this book. It does an outstanding job of introducing many concepts in a good manner and provides wonderful examples but it is very shallow. That means, I suppose, that it is likely to appeal to more people who want just an ""executive summary"" instead of being faced with the prospect of actually learning the scripts. In providing the introduction, this book does a magnificent job and whets the appitite for more."
5,The Desperate Game,Another of Jayne Castle's best I am going t order the other two of the series soon I Love her writing
3,Review of the Desparate Game,"This was not one of my favorite books by this author. I believe it might be an older book that was recently re-released, because it is not as polished as the newer books by Ms. Castle. Don't judge Ms. Castle by this book, but try one of the Harmony or Burning Lamp series."
4,The Desperate Game,The book was rather difficult to begin reading but once the opening chapters had established the characters it was difficult to stop reading until I had finished this story.
2,Reader not what I expected,"I like Jayne Castle/Jayne Ann Krentz/Amanda Quick books and planned to like this earlier one. I was disappointed in the characters, but mostly in the reader. I did not care for her at all. For that reason alone, I'm sorry I purchased all 4 books in the series at once. I would have just stuck with the books vice CDs if I had know how horrible the reader was. It was hard to tell one character from another until farther along in the scene because the voice didn't change much."
2,I should've received the amount I paid for....,"I was upset that I paid the price for ONE single pack of three, when I thought I was getting literally THREE packs of three trees."
3,"little trees air freshener, morning fresh",I love the smell of these air fresheners. However I didn't realize that they were one single pack of three. For the price I paid I should have gotten 3 packs of 3 fresheners. Will buy these again but not from here.
1,"Yeah, I knew it would be bad","The series of Wild Things movies wants desperately to be a part of neo-noir cinema, yet the characters are so cartoony, the audience doesn't really care what happens to them. The plot holes are so large that the director decided that the end credits should double as five minutes of filling in the narrative gaps. The movie is of course about greed, and there's a large amount of money at stake. It's not particularly clear how the people who end up with the money could actually access it legally. It's not worth thinking about though."
4,TURN UP THE HEAT,"I actually really loved this movie. obviously it's not going to win any oscar nominations but if you enjoyed the other wild things movies you should enjoy this one too or why even watch this far into the series. i enjoyed the great looking babes and good looking guys trying to do each other in for the money. greed for money and hunger for sex seem to rule the day for these floridians. and it's more so greed for money.even though theres plenty of sexy scenes in this movie. i enjoyed the whole wild thing series and hope they make another one but make it a full 2 hours instead of an hour and thirty two minutes. let's see more please.great exotic locations, hot looking babes, fast sexy sport cars and cool speedboats.... what more could a guy ask for. let's see a wild things 5 please !!."
3,Miami Vice and Versa,"This little film can be filed away into my: I.N.S.B Folder. ""Really It's Not So Bad!"" Certainly not great..Perhaps just ""barely"" worth your time. However if your in the mood for some hot Florida sun, filled with good looking guys and several hot bikini un-clad young women involved in the fast lanes of sex, drugs, and larceny, not to mention multiple murders, then file this one away for a rainy day. The twists and turns abound and really in addition to the nudity are enough to hold your attention. Hang on through the credits..your not done until the last line rolls by. Why not? A little c--p is required to balance out the culture. After all it is a C and C world."
2,wild things 4,this edition is no different from the first 3. there are little twists and turns that you have to pick up and has a lot sex scenes/nuddity.
3,"What A Difference! (Or, Who Knew . . . )","Having seen this show, it's evident that those who described Carlin's appearance here with adjectives like ""cautionary"" and ""tentative"" weren't kidding. While there's some good stuff here, his take on airplane travel (for example) paled in comparison to his razor-sharp routine about same in the 1992 ""Jammin' in New York"" special. It's also interesting that this and his 1978 ""George Carlin Again"" program each ran all of 90 min. (approx.), whereas after his act became more focused 60 minutes was the norm for his subsequent specials. Good as a piece of historical significance (dig Shana Alexander's intro), but better things were on the horizon."
4,Buy it!,"Funny show...you can see that he was still developing his style and was a bit nervous, but still a good watch..."
2,Check out the Dimensions,"This carrier is less than half the size of a similar one I used to have that carried full-sized logs. This one is so small, only kindling for a standard size fireplace would fit in it."
3,Log Carrier,"The log carrier was a lot smaller than I had expected or was looking for, it would be good if I only needed to bring in a few logs at a time, but I needed something that would hold about 10 logs. Price was good and the quality seamed to be good, but just wouldn't work for my purposes"
4,Great product.,"This canvas log carrier does the job. I have used it to carry upwards to eight logs at a time. It holds them securely & feels very comfortable in the hand. It seems to be very durable. I gave it four (4) stars and not five(5) because of the color. Since the color is white it gets pretty dirty from carrying the logs. I wish they made this product in a darker color. But despite the color, I highly recommend this log carrier."
2,"Looked nice, but really small.","When it arrived I was suprised at how small it was. It looked nice, but was obviously intended for logs that were less than 12 inches long, or they would tip out one way or the other. I ended up buying a much larger one for $2 more, well worth the money to be able to carry double the load."
3,Too small but sturdy,"Just got this log carrier yesterday. It is going back. It is not for the ""country home"" where you really burn wood. It is sturdy, but far too small. We have an older LL Beam carrrier which is not sold anymore by Beans. This Amazon carrier is about 5"" smaller in canvas length. The Bean carrier canvas is about 19"" long, but this canvas is about 14"". As such, it is made for short logs and cannot carry as many logs as Beans. It is too bad, because it is made well, just too small."
2,Just OK,I bought this for my son-in-law who thought it was fine but the one I have is much wider and I think better for carrying wood.
5,Helpful!,"This log carrier is helpful in the way that it takes your armload of wood out in front of you and lowers it below your center of gravity which is easier on your back and helps with your balance especially if conditions are slippery. The only downside is that when left on the floor, my cats like to pee on it:/"
3,Canvas log carrier,"It works, well but is a lot smaller than I expected. I am hoping it will last all winter long, it's going to be a long winter here."
5,Time will tell; Seems strong for now...,"I've used this several times to carry hardwood logs that equal appx. 40~60#(pounds) per load. No problems yet, and I've hauled about 25 loads across a 75 foot expanse from the log pile to the bottom of the stairs. Then hauled the load up the 15 stairs to my upstairs LR and FP. Totally happy with this, as long as it doesn't just 'blow apart' after a few uses. I see NO REASON to think there could exist a future problem! Stitching looks solid and it carries theloads I've subjected it to flawlessly. I am getting another so I can haul 2 up the steps at onetime. As long as it's THE SAME ONE I got, Buy It: it's that good. No complaints, only praise for this exact item!!!"
4,log carrier,works as expected and of nice quality well worth price others were more expensive but funtionality of this is good
3,Good quality,"I purchased this log carrier as part of a ""fire pit"" themed Christmas gift. Looks great."
5,Happy with the item,Item was rec'd quickly and is just as promised. Works well and can handle a load that is perfect for what one person can carry. Happy with the product and seller and would recommend!
1,inferior quality,"This product gives new meaning to ""Made in China"". The quality of the materials is so inferior I can't beleive Amazon even carries it as a product. The leather straps were so thin & flimsy that one broke (not detached - but accually broke in two!) after the third time I used it. This ""log"" carrier might be OK for carrying kindling, but definitely not split firewood."
2,Smaller that pictured,This product is put together well but is 3+ inches narrower that the one shown in the product picture. It will still do the job but it would be better if an accurate picture was used.
5,It Works!!!,I was looking for a split wood carrier to use with our enclosed fireplace unit. This is a well made canvas carrier and has been serving its purpose quite well.
5,Handy and not bulky,Does the trick bringing wood inside. Just enough room for a load that I can carry. It fits in my wood holder by the fireplace. Nice heavy canvas.
5,does the job,I was tired of the mess and scratches on my arms from carrying wood and hoped something would make a differance.This product is super and should last--very pleased with the product and the support
2,Small,"While this item will work for me it is much smaller (and less expensive) than the log carrier that it is replacing. I would say this is the size needed for wood being carried inside for a small wood-burning stove/heater or old-fashioned pot-bellied stove. I would not use ""log"" in the title."
4,Canvas Log Carrier,"I purchased the canvas log carrier to transport firewood from the outside in to my home.I found the product to be study, made of durable canvas. I also found that the handle has rivets that attach it to the carrier, which I think adds to it sturdiness.It hold 7- 8 good size logs easily.Good price for a good product."
4,well dont hate my scene for that,"its the my scene fans thatsay that so dont hate my scenefor what thay say ok, I do agree with you tho,oh and I luv my scene bratz to,p.s lindsay bye...."
1,IS THIS A BEAUTY????AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I AM A HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE MY SCENE FAN AND BRATZ FAN,BUT WHAT AN UGLY MADISON.HER CLOTHES ARE FINE,BUT THE FACE??????????AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!HER MOUTH???AAAAAAAAAAAH!!!AAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWW!!!!!I WILL NEVER GET THIS MADISON DOLL.I WILL GET MY SCENE GOES HOLLYWOOD MADISON IS MOOOOOOOOOOORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THIS UGLY MADISON.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*BUT NOT A LOVER ON THIS ONE!!!"
3,GREAT DOLL! Not so great hair.,"I got this doll from my BESTEST friend. The doll's cute alright, but the hair's a whole 'nother story!! It came like that straight form THE BOX!! It was so naughty and gross, SO WE STRAIGHTENED HER HAIR!! We used a flat iron, and gel, AND VOILA!!IT LOOKS AWESOME! At first i thought it would be straight and blahhh!! BUT IT DIDN'T!!It's full, not too thick, and NOT frizzy!! But, madison is my fave character out of the my scene gang. I LOVE the curly hair, most of the time. That's mostly why she's my fave! But, i would TOTALLY recommend her to ANY girl!(...)"
5,myscene is great for girls,"OK. nothing bad here people. just everyday teenage fashion. madison looks soooo awsome here. She looks great in the Masquerade Madness car that i also got for her. I think all girls should have a myscene. their great for girls growing up. parents, please buy your kid a myscene. bratz are cool too. myscene's teach girls about growing up,how to spend money,friendship,adventure,fun,fashion,and i could go on forever!!!!!!!!so parents, buy your kid a myscene. they'll be happy. thanks.Sarah"
4,We like the My Scene dolls!!!,"I like My Scene. The dolls are pretty, fashionable and their little skits and movies are entertaining. I never was big on dolls growing up, but I have a daughter that loves them. And she loves Barbie and My Scene dolls, she doesn't like bratz. My other daughter hates barbie and bratz dolls, but likes the My Scene dolls also. Barbie is okay, but My Scene is more fun for them. Especially since they have more than one male doll and they look average, not goofy looking. The guys actually have decent looking clothes and a few accessories."
4,City Kitty Madison Doll,"I bought this on the buy2 get 1 free sale. Final price was $3.52.What a deal!!! Came in a large box , has extra outfit and extras.I don't have younger kids myself, but will make a fabulous gift!! Definately worth the money from what I see in the box. Couldn't get close to this price in any store. I am really pleased with this purchase"
5,Finally a Game for Modern Fairytales!,"This book is gorgeous to look at, and absolutely full of information on the genre,as well as three playable systems to cater to any roleplayers needs.I love the genre because it's open,the possiblities for ""sagas"" (or stories) are endless.The CDrom is about as long as the book, with music and a virtual card draw machine,if you are using the card based rules, not to mention a gallery of all the wonderful art from the book.This game would be ideal for people who enjoy the works of Neil Gaiman,Charles De lint, Storm Constantine, or The Grimm brothersIf you have been looking for a elegant system with a rich storyline, this is the book for you."
4,Facinating RPG,"I was very impressed by the production value of this game. The artwork and printing are first rate. I really like the game premise that a fantasy world exists just beyond our notice in the ""real"" world. I also like the fact that the game emphasizes the storytelling aspects of roleplaying over hack and slash tabletop combat. The only complaint I have is that the rules seem overly complicated. There are other systems out there that provide for strong roleplaying that keep things much simpler. Still the book is gorgeous and fun to read."
2,a mediocre movie,I Enjoy Lots Of The Snl Movies With The Exception Of This And Superstar. Sorry To Say But I Think Every Funny Spot In This Movie Was Flooded With Sexual Humor. While I Love Comedys This Can Never Be Up There With A Night At The Roxbury. I'm Sorry Mr. Meadows But You Really Blew [It]This Time.
2,NOT AS BAD AS I EXPECTED IT TO BE BUT........!,"I have always been a fan of SNL, but there films made about skit characters have always been a little disappointing. There are a few exceptions. The Ladies Man was never one of my favorite characters, but my wife always thought it was a funny skit. The film is nothing more than a stretched out skit from SNL, but it does have a few funny moments, mostly due to funny man John Witherspoon. The pickled bar food eating scene is a riot! Ladies Man isn't going to become a classic, but for fans of the skit, this will probably entertain you for its hour and twenty minute running time."
2,another bad SNL movie,I liked Night at the Roxbury better than this. Of course that was a great movie though. So this is funny but do we ever get an actual story in any of these Lorne Michael's movies? Funny jokes are good but I just wish it was an actual movie and not a bad SNL skit. Highlights of the movie are the fake but still great looking Tiffany Amber Thiesen and Will Ferrel as the wrestler. Good movie to kill about 30 minutes or so on.
4,We've all met The Ladies Man!,"This movie is filled with hysterical, yet typical, SNL one-liners and quick witt. If you've enjoyed Mr. Meadows on SNL, you HAVE to see this movie. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps, a DJ who provides extreme advice to listeners. After a run of bad luck, he is terminated from his job and must find a past lover who will make him rich. His search is long and hilarious. This 90 minute movie will have you slipping out of your seat from comedic relief. It's sexual refrences and regular pimp like scenerios remind us that we all know someone like Leon. It could be our boyfriend, father, uncle, cousin, friend from the local bar, or even your own brother. If you're looking for something to make you cry with laughter rent or buy this movie. It's the best SNL movie. Underrated by critics, this movie will have you in a good mood for days."
4,TOO FUNNY,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY FUNNY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION FOR ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHEN IT IS JUST YOU OR YOU AND SOME FRIENDS , NO MATTER WHAT YOU'LL GET A GOOD LAUGH . EVERYTIME I SEE IT I FIND SOMETHING ELSE FUNNY. 4 STARS FROM ME!!"
1,When do I get to laugh?,"I tried to stick with this movie, but it was just too bad. Who are these people giving this 5 stars? Tim Meadows, is that you? Lorne Michaels?Really, by the time it was almost over, I was so disgusted with myself for watching as much as I did that I left. Don't waste your time! Life is short, choose good things."
3,"Funny, but only an average movie","I'm not a Saturday Night Live watcher, but I was drawn to the funny commercials for Ladies Man. Where else can you see Julianne Moore and Tiff Amber Thiessen as sex-crazed luney toons? or Will Farrell singing and dancing? This movie was funny; but only average good, not above average. This is the story of a the man-stereotype taken to the extreme: clueless, saying-the-wrong-thing, and always thinkin bout sex. Just don't expect much from this movie but some laughs; and then you can enjoy it."
4,Sweet-thang,"This is a better screen adaptation for SNL, more than we are used to seeing. Tim Meadows was great, even Kimberly Amber was pretty good, and the ... thrill of wresteling... I loved itI wasn't expecting much in the way of story, and I wasn't overjoyed, more like plesantly suprised."
4,SNL Gold,"This is a pretty good flick. Leon, the protagonist, is on the search for his secret wealthy dream girl who wants to take care of him for the rest of his life. On the way he must avoid the mob of husbands after him for sleeping with there wifes. Action as fast as the jokes, this is great buy."
5,The Perfect Mattress pad!!!,"I have bought several cheaper pads and have been disappointed. They usually shrink in the wash and rip as I try to put them on our mattress. This one is perfect. I have washed it several times, and it has not shrunk significantly. It fits our bed perfectly, and every time I climb into bed, I am reminded of the beds in some of the luxuriously soft beds in some of the hotels and inns we've stayed in. I couldn't be a more satisfied customer!"
3,I agree -- this volume is a let-down for a good series,"This is not the best book, and I had to force myself to finish it. But WHY, you may ask, did I force myself? Because I had so much enjoyed the earlier books in the series dealing with the same main character, Lafayette O'Leary. Omigoodness -- read ""World Shuffler"" and ""Time Bender"" -- they are worth it. Read this book if you NEED to know more about Lafayette and if you have an ability to push through books no matter what."
1,lack of knowledge,"just open the first sample page. you see that the author does not even understand what profit maximization, as defined by economists, is. i would be careful if i were you."
5,Fantastic Effort from newcomer,"The minute the screen opened to the snowy grounds of Antarctica and the theme came on, I knew I was in for a great companion to a good movie. I had never heard of Harald Kloser before this movie as I was expecting Emmerich's ID4 and Stargate composer David Arnold to do the score. Still, I was pleasantly surprised.I thought the theme was fantastic without being too in your face. It represented the heroism of the main characters and the conflict of man against nature in a nice subtle way. I agree with the reviewer before me who said 'Tidal Wave' was one of the highlights of the score. This definitely is reminiscent of one of my fave composers James Horner (listen to Clear and Present Danger and Courage Under Fire and you'll notice similarities).A good buy."
4,"Good, but much better with the film","From the moment I first saw The Day After Tomorrow, I absolutly loved the main theme. It's one of those themes that are so huge and stirring, you can't help but love it. However, after buying the soundtrack, I was slightly disappointed with the rest of the tracks. Part of the problem was the ording of the tracks (for instance, I think ""The President's Speech"" should appear last, as it is the last song heard in the movie). Also, most of the tracks are fairly unmoving, with the exception of ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Tidal Wave"", and ""The President's Speech"".Overall, this soundtrack is fairly good, but I've definitly heard better."
4,An Emotional Impacting Score . . .,"I was counting down the days untill the release of The Day After Tomorrow Score. Its come and gone and I've listened to the score about three times already. Its a very haunting and emotional score from start to finish especially the subtle female vocal in the first twenty seconds. The definate main highlights of this score would be ""Tidal Wave"" and ""The President's Speech"" where the use of heroic""ness"" and chaos stand out on many levels. The reason I gave the score 4 stars instead of 5 is that the main theme isn't really all that great. I guess my opinion is that I was just looking for more of an impacting main theme (that's all). Other than that, this score is one of the best additions to my collection and can be to yours. A triumphant effort for new-commer Harald Kloser!"
5,Moving and powerful,"I simply adore this soundtrack!For anyone familiar with the movie I can safely say that the music matches the scenes perfectly.My favorite track was Presiden't Speach, the music was powerful and majestic yet understated and leaving you with a deep profound dignity and respect for the forces of nature.I collect Original Movie scores, and this one is in my top 5, its simply rich, gorgeous, goose bump on your arms music. It becomes more than music, it feels real and it's amazing.Great purchase you wont regret and you will listen to it again and again."
5,Excellent Soundtrack,"I went to see the movie the when it first came out to the theaters. When the movie came on, the first thing I noticed was the soundtrack. The main theme came in the very beginning of the movie and it touched me immediately. I'm a french horn player and I love how they have a lot of horn features in the sountrack. I'm not too crazy on the ""rough songs"" like tidal wave and blizzard, but the president's speech and main theme touched me. It fit the movie perfectly. The music itself puts you in a sense of aw so you can relate to the powerful message of the movie. Over-in-all, it's a beautiful soundtrack and everyone should buy it or atleast buy the movie and listen to it!"
3,Take it or leave it...,"I bought this science book on a recommendation from friend-just not what we needed. It covers lots of information, but really geared toward young elementary. My child is not much on notebooking or coloring. Just not a good fit for us."
5,wonderful book,It is exactly what I was looking for. A great addition to our Homeschool classes. Even my 2 year has enjoyed it
2,Starts strong then slides downhill fast,"I love to try out new Christmas CD's, so I was psyched when I saw this one in the store. The CD starts out strong with the Barenaked Ladies and Sarah MacLachlan, and continues on a good pace through Sarah's cover of the Gordon Lightfoot song, ""Song for a Winter's Night"". I especially enjoyed Dido's song, ""Christmas Day"", which I had never heard before. The rest of the album was a disappointment to me, as each song following Sarah MacLachlan's got more depressing in tone. The ultimate insult was reaching the last ""song"" only to realize that I was paying for talk, not music. Definitely a waste of 20-odd minutes."
2,A Melancholy Christmas Song Collection,"This is a depressingly slow, slow, slow christmas song collection.Not what I expected for a christmas album from a string of artists like Sarah McLachlan, Barenaked Ladies, Dido, Delerium, Tara MacLean and more. What happened to joyous, warm and festive songs? This CD makes you feel like a hangover from drinking to much egg-nog at the office christmas party. If you're looking for music to set the mood for your annual holiday depression--buy it. Otherwise give it a pass. P.S. This CD is titled Christmas Songs but one third of the album is a comedic story by Stuart McLean, not a song at all."
1,A Cat Carol,This song only made me feel extremely sad. I hated it. Was it supposed to be backhanded uplifting or something?
2,too many strange unfamiliar tunes!,"There are a couple of really great versions of some songs everyone knows, especially (the Barenaked Ladies with Sarah McLachlan) God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, but there are quite a few more unfamiliar tunes that seem to have little or nothing to do with Christmas at all! I had heard part of this CD at a party, and thought it seemed different...I just didn't realize HOW different!! If you're looking for Christmas songs you know, this isn't the album for you."
1,Not quite in the Christmas spirit,"I too bought this for the BNL/Sarah track, and I liked that, but I hated the rest of this album, particularly the Cat Carol, which completely destroyed my festive holiday spirit. With albums like this around, it's no wonder depression kicks in at Christmas. Buy something cheerier."
1,Cat Lovers Beware,The Cat Carol is the most depressing Christmas song I have ever heard. Not to ruin the ending for you but THE CAT DIES! Didn't exactly put me in the holiday spirit.
2,"Interesting, but not essential","I bought this CD primarily for the first cut, the Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan's rendition of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen."" This is a great track, with a hint of old-time jazz or swing to it. The vocals, as you would expect, are tremendous.The rest of the CD however, has little to offer. Some songs are enjoyable, such as Dido's ""Christmas Day"" and ""The Cat Carol"" by Meryn Cadell is a beautiful, bittersweet tune. But halfway through the CD I started getting bored.The Barenaked Ladies cut is a classic, and I'm sure we'll here it more and more during Holiday Seasons to come, but the majority of this CD is just filler."
4,"no quality control, assembly sucks","found one of the fryer pans dented probably due to shipping,large hole in the box. holes drilled to put upper and lower sections together were to small for bolts provided had to re-drill holes. two bolts were missing for tank guard, had to go to hardware store and purchase two new bolts and nuts. found assembly very frustrating do to lack of quality control. other than that truly like the fryer overall. a set of hooks mounted on frame for utensils would have been nice."
1,Disappointed,The photo of what I ordered and what I got were different items. I had ordered a pink ladies jacket and recieved a pink dolls jacket.
4,Pink ladies,It was what we expected and what our daughter wanted. Arrived on time and in perfect condition.
2,Some are not really brass,"Got the Gilmour quick connect at Lowe's, and they are brass plated, so they look like brass in the package. But they are really light, and as soon as you start using them the ball bearing keepers start wearing into the male connector, and you can see that it is actually made of a silver colored metal that is very soft. I don't think they will last long.But when new, they do work well."
1,WATCH OUT,WATCH OUT BUYING THESE....I have used them for quite a while and used to like them a lot.... but bought some new ones lately and they LOOK LIKE BUT ARE NOT BRASS....I think the Chinese are pulling one over on Gilmour and making them out of aluminum or pot metal with a brass coloring.. They fused themselves to my faucets and hoses buy electolysis. BE CARFUL BUYING THESE AND LOOK THEM OVER CLOSELY The aluminum ones have a little funny coloring and are lighter in weight than the real brass ones.
2,Too difficult to get separated,"I bought several of these thinking they looked like good quality. And they are, very good quality, don't leak and not too big. But the little buggers are impossible to unsnap while connected to the homes. The problem is, the rubber collar is too small to get a good grip on it (esp with wet fingers). Coupled with the undersized collar, the spring tension is way too high. I ended up unscrewing the fittings from one section of hose every time I needed to separate them. (*So what good is a disconnect if you can't get it to disconnect?)I took them off and went back to a screwed connection until I can find something that is easy to use.Not recommended as far too difficult to separate once connected to the hose."
3,Tom,"These are brass and seem to be well made and not brass colored aluminum like some of the other look alikes. Bought several paris and tried them out. No leaks but one female connector did not function properly, spring was not holding unit in place. Had to return for another. Others were water tight and easy to open/close. Have used plastic in the past and they all failed after about a month of use when the female unit lost its ability to hold the joint in place."
3,Questionable Design,"When I first got this set and tried it out, it leaked badly, then just came undone by itself. Try after try, you need to insert the male section, then press the black ring down which didn't seem to want to stay. I tried adding another washer to the male end and it seems to be working now...however, there really isn't a positive click to get it in. ...on the other hand, I don't think that other brands that are quick connect do any better. This used to be a good company, but their quality seems to have diminished somewhat."
1,Poorly made product,I had high hopes for this highly rated hose quick connect set. The product looked well made and the rubber collars seems a nice way to protect the fittings and make it easy to use. Unfortunately the rubber collars are the downfall of this product. During installation the rubber easily slipped off the knurled base on both the male and female fittings. When trying to connect the two the rubber collar on the lock ring would slide forward and block any connection unless you made the effort to push the collar back into position and connect your end device at the same time. If the rubber portion of the product had stayed in place this could have been a great product.
5,FAR better than the KJ version!,"Got this for my dad for Christmas, he loves it. LOL, he's almost through it already and we're only in January! The quality of translation is SO much better than the KJ version--things that didn't make any sense or which obviously had been chopped or 'adjusted' to fit a particular religious agenda back then, are here. Makes for a real scripture reading that is truly fulfilling, not headache inducing trying to 'fill in the blanks'. Definately going to get myself a copy. It is beautiful and far more meaningful than the KJ version."
2,Tyndale' or Daniell's literary voice?,"I bought this book because it appeared to be the only book in modern English, available in Amazon, that would be a good translation of Tyndale's New Testament. I browsed Tyndale's ""original"" version online, and the letters are just hard to read for me in his old English. This book appeared to be the best option, except that when I began to read it, the common literary voice of traditional Bibles is not there. The literary voice that appears to come out is the author's.Since he is no Paul, Moses, or Tyndale, just as few examples, this book is not a keeper for me. The Bible, no mater what translation it is, is supposed to be the Word of God, the voice of God, does it not?In terms of translation and grammar, well, probably there should be relatively little problem here."
3,Use of secular term,"On the third page of his introduction to The New Testament 1526 edition by William Tyndale, David Daniell uses the non-christian term, CE (Common Era) instead of the Christian term, AD (In the year of our Lord). I have no personal knowledge of David Daniell, and am not in any way trying to state that David Daniell is anti-christian. I'm just confused as to why he chose not to use the Christian term."
2,Plaza Sesamo: Vamos a Cantar,"The DVD is completely in Spanish... that is a plus. ""Vamos a Cantar"" which means ""Let's sing"" and that it is what the DVD is all about. The DVD is song after song after song. To me most of the songs are not even catchy to kids. If your kids want a Plaza Sesamo music video DVD this is what you are looking for."
1,Damaged DVD - can't tell,"I bought this DVD as a present for my granddaughter. It arrived promptly, but I did not open it until her birthday which was just a few days ago.Big disappointment because the DVD was damaged and unusable.A piece of the case broke and scratched the surface of the DVD.I just contacted the seller about a replacement.I'll let you know if the DVD is worthwhile when and if I get a replacement."
1,waste of money,"Theres no doubth Sesame street is the best show for kids and toodlers but this particular item is SOOOO BORING !!! My one year old even cant see more than 3 minutes , I hardly can feel amuse by this, Dont waste your money"
5,My daughter loves Plaza Sesamo,"I found Plaza Sesamo On Demand when my daughter was about two months old. Ironically, it was the only show she would actually sit and watch and to this day, she is going to be one year next month, it is still her one and only show. Vamos a Cantar is one of two 55 minute DVD's I found online (and in stores) which is great because as she gets older I want her attention span to develop. The shows On Demand or on Saturday and Sunday mornings are only about 25 minutes. I recommend Vamos a Cantar for all children; while it is all in Spanish and I don't understand it, she seems to love it. The songs are cute, too. The product shipped fast and is of great quality so far and we have played it at least 5 times since receiving it about one month ago."
1,bad investment,This video is boring. It's like watching sesame street on t.v nothing special.Waste of moneyPlaza Sesamo: Vamos a Cantar
1,"Songs are odd, not for teaching Spanish","Our bilingual toddlers (Caribbean Spanish) are bored and unengaged by this. The songs are hard for adults and kids to learn or follow. Just plain odd. Me Gusta Ser Yo is much more fun. Even though there are few quality choices in Spanish DVDs, skip this one."
5,kitty's best friend,this is the best product i have ever used its safe does what it says it will do i have 3 cats and it does a wonderful job. easy to dispose of no harm no fuss love it love it.bambie1195
4,Really good product,"We really like Feline Pine Cat Litter, it is a very low maintenance type of product and friendly to the environment."
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:Few biblical texts are more daunting, and yet more fascinating, than the book of Job-and few have been the subject of such diverse interpretation. For the author, the mystery of God's ways and the appalling evil and suffering in the world are at the heart of Job's significant contribution to the canon of Scripture. This study offers a holistic reading of Job, with particular reference to its depiction of creation and evil, and finds significant clues to its meaning in the striking imagery it uses. The author takes seriously the literary and artistic integrity of the book of Job, as well as its theological profundity. He concludes that it is not so much about suffering per se as about creation, providence, and knowing God, and how-in the crucible of suffering-these are to be understood. He encourages readers to listen to this remarkable literature, to be moved by it, and to see its progress from shrieking protest to repentance and vision."
3,LEDO,purchased as a gift. Nothing else for me to say - do not have any further time or interest in reviewing this.
3,Mastering the Verbal SAT1/PSAT,"The book starts out fine, explaining the steps as it goes along. The guided practice sessions are great too. But what threw me off is the fact that there are no answer keys to many of the practice sessions that are in the book. What good is a practice session without an answer key?Hope somebody can provide an insight as to why this book is with out answers."
2,NO ANSWERS,"Be warned. If you are using this for self-study, you may be disappointed to learn that there is NO answer key given. You can't actually test yourself. The text was designed to be used by students. Presumably (but not on Amazon), there is a teacher's text.We haven't gone past the first chapter yet because we need to track down the answer key."
1,Not representative of MCAT questions,"These 1001 books are not representative of the way you need to know material for the MCAT. They focus on having the equations memorized to be able to solve their questions, whereas many of the MCAT passages offer the equation in the passages if you need them."
3,okay,"There are a number of mistakes in this book, and it gets very discouraging because it'll only confuse you. but, overall, it's a good practice book minus the mistakes."
2,Went past the scope of the books,"I really, truly hated the EK 1001 series, and this book is no exception. A great deal of the questions are not covered in the gen chem book. Not only that, but there are very few (if any, I can't recall which had them and which didn't) passages, mostly just discretes. The problem with this is that you walk into the test and have a difficult time applying concepts to more vague passages."
3,Good but not as good as others are implying,"I think this book is great if you are preparing for the DAT. But I don't think this book will give you 30's for the MCAT. Granted, you need to know how to answer these types of problems. But you need to practice real passages. I would strongly encourage you to acquire the Princeton Review Science Workbook. They come with the course but you can usually buy them used off of students who completed the course and the MCAT. Go to a messageboard for MCAT students etc. Aside from the real MCATs that AAMC releases, the Princeton Review book will help you. Ideally, you should use the Examcracker books first to hone your skills of the basic sciences. And then you should use the Princeton Review Science Workbook to apply those skills.But in now way will these books by themselves automatically equip you to handle the MCAT."
4,Pretty good study aid,"This study aid has a good breadth of coverage of concepts covered by the MCAT. The questions are all in the style of the MCAT (Roman numeral questions, etc.). My only complaint was that I was hoping for some passages and passage-based questions for practice, and those are completely absent in this book. Overall, I think it's a good addendum to any study curriculum for the MCAT."
3,Note Cards in Book Form,"Essentially, this book is a collection of very simple gen. chem questions that function more as note cards rather than MCAT practice. It is great in the sense that it drills in concepts, facts, and simple procedures. However, the answers to the questions leave something to be desired. Often times they are little more than test taking strategies, ""Use 'Roman Numeral' problems to you advantage. Since answer I is in all the choices, it has to be right."" It is not hard to go back to your chem text book or the exam krackers chem book to review, but it would be nice for the authors to succinctly answer the question, and show why the other answers are wrong. This is the way that the Exam Krackers Verbal Reasoning and Biology Question books are written, which I would highly recommend. Also, as I have noted before, the questions do not at all reflect the types of questions that a student will see on the real test."
3,How useful is this?,"While the book may contain 1001 questions a number of them are not quite MCAT caliber questions. Also the explanations are very short, in fact the shortest I have seen among any MCAT prep book. In my opinion, this book is useful for helping you get started on your feet. If you are looking for more challenging problems I would recommend using other sources"
3,Absolutely Wonderful,No disrespect to Luther or Dionne but I have always thought Mavis Staples version of A house is not a home is the BEST and then Luther. There aren't any singers out there today who can touch Mavis voice. When they are throwing out accolades of diva (many of whom don't deserve it) Mavis should be included. If you want to know what real music sounds like get this cd you won't be diappointed.
4,solid soul set,"I was a big fan of the Staple Singers and have enjoyed the recent Mavis solo albums very much too. But these two early solo albums, now packaged together on a single disc, had escaped my notice until recently. Well, I'd seen them many years ago, but had never heard them. Not sure why it took me so long to discover these albums, but I'm sure glad I finally got this CD and heard them. Very solid collections of songs, particularly the first solo album. On that one she does scorching versions of ""A House is Not a Home,"" ""The Choking Kind,"" ""Security,"" and ""Son of a Preacher Man,"" among others. Soul power plus! The other album, ""Only the Lonely,"" is more laid back and I don't like the song selection as much (I was never crazy about ""You Send Me"" or ""Since I Fell for You""), but there is still a lot to like on that one too. Overall, many tunes worth a listen on this two-for collection. Mavis has one of the greatest voices in Soul/R&B."
5,Achilles Heel...Pedro's best album yet...,"I have purchased Pedro's other albums (Control, It's hard to find a friend...etc) and I must say that they are all great but I believe that this album, Achilles Heel, is certainly the best. Bazan has always been a genius with his lyrics and I believe in this album it shows his full potential.This album is a must get for all of you emo and indie rockers out there. This album along with Death Cab for Cutie's Transatlanticism is definately on the top of my favorite albums.All of the songs on this album are great but I'll go ahead a list a couple of highlight songs from Achilles Heel: Bands with Managers, The Fleecing, Keep Swinging, A Simple Plan.Get this album!"
5,One of Pedro's Best,"This probably my favorite pedro album to date. It would rank somewhere between ""It's Hard To Find A Friend"" and ""Control"" as far as its tone and content go but with much better production quality. But don't take my word for it. Go to www.achilles-heel.net and have a listen for yourself. (you can hear the whole album here, and YES, its official, and legal)"
3,Err...,"Musically, these guys are good. Problems? Every song sounds the same, and the singer has to quit being so self-indulgent. Who cares about ""Bands with Managers?"" Have some fun, I mean come on. Plus, anybody with a family who is thinking baout suicide whould probably be punched in the face, just to knock some sense into them. Sometimes the lyrics are good - failing to go sober but he never even tried, and you want this band to snap out of it and light a little, appreciate existence a little more."
1,no thanx,"this might be Pedro's best, but that's not saying much.laptopsguys in girl's jeanspinkfake glasseshair over one eyesensitiveuni-strap purse/backpackscardigan sweatersclonesvinylsemo(all of the above)"
3,Eh,"I am a HUGE Pedro the Lion fan. I own every album and know the lyrics to every song. My excitement for the release of this album was lost when I actually listened to it. The lyrics weren't as meaningful as they were on previous albums. I couldn't get into this album, despite my many efforts. Many say that this is the best they've heard yet, but I disagree. The CD is not without it's good points of course, but overall I'd say you're better off buying one of the older albums for the real taste of Pedro the Lion."
4,Not the album I'd want a band to end on...,"I've been a fan of Pedro the Lion for some time, and while this album does show some progression and experimentation, it also takes several steps backwards in song-writing and melody. While Bazan clearly expresses his newfound vocal range in a number of songs, the album misses the cohesiveness and droniness of his other albums, in otherwords, this album is short on what makes Pedro the Lion great. There are some highlight songs such as ""North am-transcontinental"" which is cleverly written and very catchy, but overall this album has little staying power and is a far cry from past successes.If you're new to Pedro the Lion, save this album for later and start with ""Hard to find a friend"" or ""Control.""PS - it was supposed to be two stars, but I accidentally gave it four and I can't change that. Oops!"
3,Three Fantastic Songs,"While this album is probably my least favorite of Pedro, it has perhaps 3 of the top 10 songs Bazan has ever written in my opinion. Arizona, Foregone Conclusions, and The Poison are all fantastic songs and make this album worth checking out. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs do not live up to the genius of the other albums."
4,Pedro Gets a Bit More Diverse,"Achilles' Heel builds upon Pedro the Lion's previous works. Not as hard hitting as Control, it follows the acoustic style of Bazan's other albums, while also adding some new elements. Additional keyboards and vocal styles give the album some diversity without straying too far from the Pedro we know and love. Though the lyrical content is generally as heavy as usual, the music is upbeat and has a much happier feel than Control. This is a Pedro must-have. Good from start to finish."
5,A must for the serious carlin fans,Carlin does it again! His skits on driving as well as his flame thrower skit do it for me. Don't miss out on this one!
3,The story of a Navajo boy.,"This novel won the 1932 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. It is the story of a young Navajo boy in the 1920s who wishes to become a medicine man like his Uncle. The book is filled with the fables of the old Navajos and descriptions of some of their ceremonies. I agree with the 1998 reviewer from Washington, D.C., that the comments made by the Horn Book seem a little too harsh. Apparently, there was a great interest in Navajo culture at this time in the U.S. The 1930 winner of the Pulitzer Prize in fiction was ""Laughing Boy"" by Oliver La Farge. But, the Horn Book probably doesn't care for that book either!"
3,Not so universal.,Ordered this product when I ordered a Viewsonic Pro8100 projector so I could mount it. This mount only includes up to a 5mm thread and the Viewsonic requires a 6mm. So after 2 trips to Lowes to get not only the correct screw size but also the correct spacers because of it's design I was a little put off. After getting the correct pieces the projector is mounted perfectly in place. Good product overall but they need to place an * next to Universal.
4,Nicely made projector mount,"I just bought and installed this Vantage Point mount. The design seems quite good it's quite heavy and it is a sturdy as all get-out. When I'm not using it as a projector mount, I could use it for home defense.Anyway, the mount bolted to the office wall just below the ceiling tiles and it's rock steady.The only reasons I'm giving it four stars is that there should be either a quick release or some way to hang the projector while attaching it to the arm. Also, the instructions are one of those where they cover several different models and have lots of If you have this one do this and if you have that one do that. Hey, it's ONE freaking page! How hard would it be to write one for each.Anyway, it's pretty easy to figure out how to mount it on the wall and get the projector up there. I'd recommend it."
3,Good build but pricy for the item.,"I bought this ""Vantage Point CGUPM12-B Universal Front Projector Mount - Black"" for my Mitsubishi HC6500 Projector and the first impression is it a very small item as compared to the price. A simple Project mount could be delivered way cheaper than this. But the good thing is that it's a good build. Easy to move all direction makes it very convenient for installation and adjustment of the projector to the Media room."
3,Works ok. but drain tube is a pain.,"I suggest you get the belly bag without the 24"" drain tube. The belly bag is definitely a step up from leg bags."
4,All About What Mommy Doesn't Hate,"Jim Arnosky's ""All About"" series deserves five stars for meeting my stringent Mommy criteria: it holds my children's interest, it teaches me something I didn't know, I can get through reading it aloud in 10 minutes even if my kids keep asking me about the illustrations, and - most importantly - it doesn't annoy me when I have to read it over and over again. I give him four stars because he misuses commas, and I have strong feelings about punctuation. All About Turkeys does justice to a noble bird, and thanks to Jim Arnosky I've learned what wattles are. Any children's author who teaches me a new word is a friend of mine."
3,Repeated information.,"I had high hopes for this book, because I liked Illes' other work, The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells (read my review for that), but I found that I was a bit disappointed with this one - mainly because most of the spells in here were in her 5000 Spells book, just expanded. So, if you have 5000 Spells, there's really no need to get this book. I also don't constitute getting a man to love you back as an ""emergency"" (one of the spells in this book), and I would never work a spell of that nature. But, Illes is not a Wiccan, so she doesn't adhere to the rules of magic that I do.Overall, I recommend 5000 Spells for the greater variety of ingredients and topics instead."
2,well...I'm not going to return it.,"For the price I was very disappointed with the quality. It arrived with some or the pieces corners bashed and the wood glue punctured, covering most of the hardware. Most of it went together very easily, but there were a few pieces that didnt fit exactly perfectly. One of the handles screw holes was cracked so the screw wouldn't hold. Finally, a corner bracket for the shelf was missing. All of these things are minor and one trip to home depot will sort them out. However, this is the sort of thing I expect from walmart, not when I pay several hundred dollars. So, while I'm not dissatisfied enough to return it, I'm certainly not 100% pleased, and would not recommended it to anyone else"
5,Felco highly recommended,I purchased my first pair of Felco-8 pruners as a result of a recommendation from a master gardener who owned a pair of Felcos for 25 years. They were shipped immediately and now I enjoy pruning my 16 rose bushes because of the ease of using these high quality pruners. I like the fact that you can deadhead a very thin branch just as easy as one of the larger ones. Certainly worth the extra money.
1,cutting edge sticks,"I've used Felco shears for years and finally had to buy a new pair. They are almost unusable. The shears stick, such that I have to force them open each time I make a cut. Clearly the cutting blade has been poorly ground. I should have returned them, but needed them immediately, so instead I've taken them to a sharpening service to make them operational. What has happened to Felco? I guess Swiss precision isn't what it used to be."
2,Rather disappointing,"As Felco as such an excellent reputation, I expected higher quality. The blades became dull almost immediately though the pruners were only used for ""light duty"". Within a couple of months the blades were rusty AND dull, so when the spring popped out and disappeared into the garden I said, ""to heck with it!"" and went to Wal Mart where I spent less than $10 for a pair that are serving me nicely their second year. I dunno--others LOVE their Felcos. Go figure."
4,"Good, but not the best","Several years ago I bought a Felco No. 6 pruner for my wife. I decided I needed a slightly bigger pruner from myself so I recently bought the Felco No. 10. It is a good tool and very well made but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as easy to use as the No. 6. The blade is bigger so it can cut a bigger branch (up to 1"") but it also takes more hand strength, even on the smaller branches, than does the No. 6. The result is that if I'm doing extensive trimming my hand gets tired more quickly and I can't get as much trimming done. If I were going to do it again, I'd buy the smaller (No. 6) pruner."
2,Felco f-8 pruner,Spring broke first use. Hard to get parts and warranty is no good.Works ok but not any better than others.
5,Never Go Wrong With Felco,"I've been an avid rosarian for years. Felco is the industry standard, don't listen to the envious. They're so good that I only had to buy another because I lost my old pair in a move. Love the ergonomic design (altho the standard ones were fine). You do have to do a little minimal upkeep to ward off rust, dry after using with an occasional dab of oil as needed. But if you do that, they'll last forever."
5,Garden Wish Fulfilled,"After years of admiring these pruners, I finally received a pair for my milestone birthday. I adore these pruners as the workhorse in my gardens, which is everything from pruning perennials, deadheading, removing limbs, trimming shrubs, maintaining fruit trees, etc... Originally, I wanted the No. 2 Felcos, but after trying several in the local garden store, I felt as though the No. 8 was my best choice for comfort, grip strength, and reduced strain on my wrist and hand. I am thrilled at the quality, durability, and function of these pruners. My old Fiskars will always have a special place in my heart, but my new Felcos will be right there with me as my gardens, and myself, evolve."
5,Greatest Hits from the greatest band,"Here are the greatest hits from the one and only dc Talk. It highlights the bands ""Free At Last"", ""Jesus Freak"", and ""Supernatural"" records. It contains remixes and two brand new never heard songs ""Chance"" which is a great song that sounds like something U2 would do and ""Sugar Coat It"", a fun pop song that has an incrediblly explosive rap by Toby and a very catchy chorus!! Pick it up, you wont be sorry!! It will be a highlight in your collection!"
4,Plenty of Solid Music,"DC Talk's 19 track Greatest Hits album is quality music throughout. From ""Jesus is Just Alright"" to ""Jesus Freak"" to ""My Will"", the album is diverse, sophisticated, and meaningful. Two new songs -- Chance and Sugarcoat It -- are nothing special, but if you are looking for an album with some substance, both musically and lyrically, this will provide it."
4,Missing a couple tracks,"I know, I know, they can't have all their greatest hits on here, but I can't believe they don't have ""Into Jesus"" one of my all time fave dc Talk songs. ""Dive"" is another song I think deserves to be on there. But really, it is a very good collection. I especially like the ""Say the Words"" remix, and it's good to hear from the Morgans again!"
5,Great CD!,"Dc Talk is a really good group and when I borrowed this cd I thought some of the new songs were great like Say the Words (Now), Chance and Sugarcoat It. It does have all the other good songs on it too.Some songs are Rock,pop and hip hop and others. If you enjoy those kinds of music, you would want this cd because you might enjoy it. This cd is a really good cd to buy if you wanna get a taste of dc Talk. Every time I listen to the older songs it reminds me of the time I first listened to them. If you never heard of this cd or dc Talk, you should get this cd. It is a Great cd!"
2,Intermission: The Greatest Hits,This CD skipped and was delivered in a paper cover so we didn't have a cover with the list of songs on it. We ordered it because we were interested in the song Jesus Is Still Alright With Me and there was another album we could have ordered but it was way too expensive. But you get what you pay for as they say.
3,it's the song selection...,"this is da bomb but there's 1 problem,THE SONG SELECTION!!!!!BELOW ARE THE SONGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED FROM THE C.D.Sheavenbound,gah ta be=from first album.walls,things of this world=nu thang.luv is a verb,that kinda girl,jesus is just alright,time is...=free at last.so help me god,jesus freak,between u and me,like it,love it ,need it=jesus freak.consume me,my friend,supernatural,godsend=supernatural.that is how the song selection should have been.see u next review,cody"
1,overated band,"When the mainstream radio stations started playing ""Jesus Freak"" Toby Mckennan was quick to accept the comparison to the late great Kurt Cobain.Considering the two men are miles apart politically, I thought the comparison was simply pretentious,and breathed a huge sigh of relief when it stopped clouding up the airwaves."
5,This CD is great,"Intermission, dc talk's latest, lives up to the name greatest hits. The songs picked are old classics and magnificent. The brand new song, Change, is a wonderful ballad that shows dc talk's true talent. If your looking for a great Christmas gift, or just a great CD, this one is for you."
5,the hits,"DC Talk has proven themselves to be a hard-hittin group in the christian music scene. Their style, lyrics and singing abilities have caught people's attention everywhere... this cd is great because it takes most of their hit songs and brings it to you on one cd, along with a few new numbers... it is definately worth checkin out..."
5,awesome !!,"This Cd is Dc Talk's 2nd greatest hits cd and it is the best in my opinion. It contains 19 of their best and most popular songs from Jesus Freak to Colored people, this cd has the goods. The makers of this cd have also thrown some screwballs into ths making of it by remixing some songs like Hardway and Say The Words, these songs are almost better than their orignal counterparts. Dc Talk is my favorite band and i believe they will be making good Christian music for a long time."
3,Too Many Songs from the Same Album,"There are too many songs on this CD from one album: Jesus Freak. Yes, I consider it their best work, but I don't think it deserves to have practically half the songs on the CD. On the other hand, there are not enough tracks from their Supernatural album. My Friend (So Long) was a HUGE hit from this album, and yet it was left off. Also, there are no songs from their first two albums. At least one track from each would have been nice. The highlights of the disc - the two new songs, and the remixes. Other than that, expect revisiting Jesus Freak, with a little Supernatural mixed in."
2,not too fun,This game was'nt fun for me at all. It was to hard riding the bike and it's just a boring game overall. Planing to trade it in for beowulf.
2,Nothing to be excited about,"Pros: Can't think of any (ummm...maybe the vivid colors, MAYBE)Cons: Everything! Gets really frustrating and repetitive even some will say it's not. Go for some other racing game, this is not worth the money, rental...MAYBE."
2,it's ok,not the best game but not that bad. If your into racing game you may like it but if your a hard core gamer your may not
3,Ok item,Item works and seems fine. The case was not original and came with just a generic case. Wasn't said in description.
3,Okay game,"Fun at first, but loses it luster after a few months. The series has had some ups and downs and would rate this one 3/5."
5,"The Classic, The Best","By far mine and the family's favorite out of the whole motor storm series, and we have them all. The graphics might not be as good as apocalypse, but the game play to us is better.Cheers."
4,Muy buen entretenimiento,Mucha adrenalina con este juego. Buenos grÃ¡ficos. El concepto bien original. El realismo de las carreras es bastante aceptable. Muy buen entretenimiento
3,Okay,This is kinda fun but he vehicles can be a bit difficult to control. The tracks are very exciting though and offer a variety of cool things like ramps and jumps.
5,Fun game!,"This game is a fun racing game, although when I bought I didnt know that it is only a one player game....you can play others online, but not play multiplayer so that is the only downside, other than that its fun to race and the crashes are pretty neat."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"This game was great.... this was my first ps3 game i got for my ps3... Now having 40 games, its a suprise that still to this day i play this game.... LOVE IT"
3,"Fun, but it gets boring","I bought this game because it was the first game I ever played on a PS3. Dont get me wrong, its a fun game, but there are very few tracks and it gets kinda repetitive. Also, this game doesnt support PSN tropies. so that was a bummer for me.overall a fun game, but there are better games out there for the same price!"
4,Awesome,"The ONLY complaint I have is the horrible wait times when picking vehicles because it has to load the 3d image of the vehicle. They fixed that in Pacific Rift. Otherwise, this games is awesome. In my opinion this is one of the best race games out there. I'm not a fan of very realistic simulations, but I don't care for races where the cars on on rails either. This is a nice balance of arcade fun with just enough realism and grit to make it extremely playable for hours."
4,MotorStorm Racing is Great!,"I purchased this video game for my sons, and they can't get enough. They play separate, and they challenge each other on the different levels. I don't play, personally, but I enjoy that they enjoy it so much."
4,Fun so far,"The graphics are great and game play is fun.Tried to use the sixaxis with no real success. Was able to use it as long as I made sure I kept the controller level front to back. If it is not level you will start to nose dive or back flip when in the air. I usually play laying in bed, so it is hard to keep the controller flat. The mud splatter can get rather annoying at times, but I guess that is what it is meant to do.I have not played it an extreme amount yet. So I cannot complain about redundancy."
2,INCREIBLE que un juego falle en lo mas basico,"el juego fue parte del combo para la PS3 80GB, asi que uno siempre le busca el lado positivo.pero un juego que se jacta de soportar hasta 12 jugadores, como es posible que no sea capaz de simplemente dejar que dos controles se conecten y puedan jugar.uno se pregunta si los diseÃ±adores son inexpertos o simplemente no les importa ofrecer un buen producto para obligarlo a comprar otro. verdaderamente una decepcion.en si el juego es bueno sino fuera por lo anterior y definitivamente no vale la pena comprarlo."
2,I can't believe it!,"I'm sorry but this is the first game I ever bought that was only one player! Sure you can play on the internet against eleven other people. But what happen to people having fun in the same room with two or four players having a blast splitscreen. What is the point of having four controller support if most games are online multyplayer! A racing game that does not support two or four player splitscreen is INSANE!!!! Don't get me wrong, the game is fairly good for single play. But that suffers too with so little tracks and you on some levels your forced to play only a certain vehicle type! While your computer racers have any vehicle they want! PS3 is going to suffer big time if it don't get any decent made games very soon. Except Resistance Fall of Man. Now thats a game! The Only one Made Right!"
2,Sony disappoints again - Not 12 players but only 1,"The graphics are great and the play exceptional, but if you were looking to share the experience with anyone else, other than on-line, forget it. THIS IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME, which is hard to believe in a racing game. Isn't the whole point of racing, to compete against someone else? Yes, you can compete on-line, but all of that side-by-side interaction is lost. I had waited for this release so that I could play side-by-side against my brothers and friends, but not with this title. Perhaps if EA Sports had released it, it would have lived up to its billing. Sorry Sony, you again deliver less than the hype."
1,Ignore the positives!,"Man, what are you people thinking? This is just a PS2 game with updated graphics. The controls are HORRIBLE. The 6 axis gimmick really shows how weak it is here. Skip this game, it is a big waste of time. There are about 10,000 better racing games for the PS2 or xbox."
3,Would of been a great game,"For all the hype of blu ray and how much data and bells and whistles the PS3 can do, I think this game fails to take advantage of the situation. I think this game could of been delayed to help make it more enjoyable. The lack of maps and lack of splitscreen multiplayer sets this game back, instead of forward (next gen). Playing online is great, but why did they bother taking out the offline multiplayer aspect? Would it have affected the game that badly? Also, yea, there are patches down the road the developer can put in, but we're not judging the game down the road, we're reviewing it as it is now. Although this game is graphically top notch, I think they forgot that gameplay and substance is where it's at, and not just graphics."
2,Misleading in the number of players,"I would love for game advertisers to know the difference between online multiplayer and console multiplayer. There is a very important difference. This game lacks the ability to be played as a multiplayer console game.Sony, your misleading advertising (through lack information) is most disappointing."
2,More Frustrating Than Fun,"The game features incredible graphics and a wide variety of vehicles but that's about it. It is clear programmers took a lot of short cuts such as using the same tracks over and over and over... They also used the age old (and very unrealistic) trick of having the computer controlled vehicles vary their speed based on your success. The better you do, the better they do. So if you're struggling just stop, wait ten seconds and then you'll be able to catch the leaders. You can also get your vehicle stuck in several places with nothing in the programming to reset you. Your only option is to hold the boost button down until you explode. But by the time that happens, the competition is long gone. I've played a lot of great racing games... this isn't one of them."
4,Fantastic Off Road Racing,"The levels are beautiful. Great vehicles, great music. High flying jumps are great fun. Even crashing is a good time."
3,"rented, not bought","I rented this game, and while there is great action and crashes, I found it quite difficult to win. Understand that I didn't use it alot, so I didn't know the tracks well, which will allow easier competition. One thing that is very cool is there are no skill settings, the game does it all for you. As you get better, the competition gets better, so even though I was winning, I could not dominate. Even tracks I won handily on early in the game became very difficult to win. I don't think the minimum skill level is suitable for younger kids (less than 13), so I didn't end up buying it. Fun but pretty difficult for me."
2,Good controls but bad Ai,Game is fun in the beginning when it is beatable but later the opponents will not try to win in favor of stopping you from winning. They will slow when you are stuck behind them. Also the menu selection process is slow and non intuitive. I could not figure what I was suppose to do. Do you have to come in first on all races etc? Loading and selecting the vehicles was slow. I could not finish as it got too difficult and frustrating and repetitive.
3,"Awesome game, just not enough content","It looks great playing on the ps3 and it is really really fun, but you just don't get enough to justify its $60 price tag. I love this game, but it just needs some more tracks and vehicles. Maybe even a few more game modes. Split screen wouldn't be a bad idea either come to think of it. But great racing game if you can get it at a discount price"
3,Kinda blows,"Graphics are good, tracks are very large which makes for a fun game in general - but the vehicles are way too sensitive. Seems like every little mistake causes a flip or explosion requiring a do-over. Gets annoying fairly quickly."
4,Plain Fun,"I'm not really into racing games, actually I don't really like... But since this game came with the PS3 I bought some months ago, I have to admit I have played a lot. I really liked the game, The graphics are fantastic, the races are fun (it's something between and simulator and an arcade) and the game play is fantastic. The only con is that there are only 8 tracks (with several ways each, but only 8)and no multi-player off-line. Anyway, I think it's a worthy I try. I liked it.Be aware: It's a really hard game, some casual players may get bored."
3,"NOT IMPRESSED, IT WAS MEDIOCRE 6.5 OUT 10","Although I am an Xbox 360 owner I still whenever I can check out games on other platforms like I want to try Heavenly Sword and the new Ratchet and Clank. However, when I sat down to play this game I wasn't impressed by much. The graphics looked pretty but the gameplay didn't offer much even in it's destructive racing action. The racing grows tired quickly and I found myself getting bored by it's mediocre combat racing which feels more in vain of the mediocre Full Auto, instead of the intense and addicting action of games like Burnout and Flatout. Unless you just absolutely cannot wait for the new and exciting Burnout Paradise you may purchase this game, but seriously, just wait for Burnout instead."
2,"Looks great, get's old fast","First off the game looks, feels, and appears amazing. Best graphics and handling of a racing game i've seen. However it gets boring real quick. There are very few tracks and you just keep doing them over and over and the only thing that changes is the type of vehicle you drive and the difficulty. And the few tracks that there are, aren't even that fun to begin with. I'm only on level two, and I'm already bored.Get this game if you like cheap thrills, but if you're looking for substance and re-playability, this game sucks.Take a lesson from Off road fury 4, they had a ton of great tracks. You could upgrade your vehicle, buy new vehicles, and there was even a story mode. This game gives you no incentive to keep playing."
5,great offroad racing,"I can't beilive seeing these negative reviews, this game is amazing! the graphics are nearly true to life, and the gameplay is superb, don't beilive the negative reviews I challenge you to see for yourself this game is amzing."
2,not as good as penguin,"I also bought the penguin head open mouth and I have to say it's so much more realistic than the alligator. I had some friends visit my lake recently and no one even asked what a penguin was doing in Florida. I mean, it looked so natural. Even the pelicans didn't shy from their business on the alligator so I had it removed after a few weeks. But the penguin stays. No one touches the penguin."
5,Fabulous!,"I admit I was a bit skeptical, but this is working out great. It looks so real and since we placed it in the pond our last 5 koi fish remain. Prior to the alligator purchase, we had 12 koi fish and something ate them."
3,Entertaining gay coming-of-age/mystery,"This one was a very enjoyable read. I have only given it three stars because the one thing that bothered me is that the added mystery - while enjoyable -- made me feel as if the author some how set up and then chickened out on the more adult, difficult aspects of the story - as if he was afraid that we would stop reading and just dismiss it as another coming out tale. Regardless, there is a lot of good stuff here and it is much better than a lot of the gay novels floating around now."
4,Good Beach read,"This book was good quick read. It had an interesting plot line that had some interesting turns. However, the book ended too perfectly for me and seemed a bit forced to come out with a happy ending. The book seemed to come to an almost too perfect ending. However, it was still a good read and suggest it to anybody who enjoys this genre of books."
4,Pretty Impressive,"I don't know exactly what I was expecting from this novel, but it delivered a lot more than I was anticipating.From all the reviews comparing it to The Catcher In The Rye, I was expecting a classic, gay take on the bildungsroman. In a lot of ways, it's nothing like that, since I wouldn't say the main character discovers himself so much as discovers others around him. But that's not a bad thing.A lot of plot, which reads on paper like a Eugene O'Neill play, would almost be ludicrous if Yates didn't have such a keen ear for dialog and the ability to create likable characters."
4,NOT BAD FOR A DEBUT NOVEL,"Bart Yates's ""Leave Myself Behind"" is an entertaining read without reaching the level of artistic merit that a few other reviewers have allocated it. The main character, Noah, is a rather annoying young man who rather exemplifies the sort of crass and inappropriate nature of so many of today's youth (I know what you are all thinking, but I'm actually only 27; so these inconsiderate and often downright rude adolecents were, and unfortunately still are, my peers). Anyway, back to the book...There were several endearing qualities to Mr. Yates's writing style (some beautiful descriptions, some poignant prose, and several just plain hilarious ""zingers""). There were also some moments when it felt like perhaps the main purpose of Noah was to be the voice to express some of the author's own unexpressed feelings and prejudices. Overall, an enjoyable read, but certainly no ""Catcher in the Rye!"""
5,The Rockin' Nolee doll!,"I got this doll around when they first released them,and it's been one of my absolute FAVS! Ok,first off she has her little pug (which I love) Cookie dressed up like a rockstar (like herself),also she includes,a SWEET guitar (that glows in the dark),an extra outfit (a skirt and a shirt that says rockstar or something to that effective),some WAY cool boots that have like belts on them,a purse (that's REALLY cool!),lipstick,a compact with powder puff,a butterfly choker,red arm cuffs,a cellphone,and a masquerade mask. What she's wearing is,a puffy red sleeveless T-shirt (almost a spaghetti top),a cool coat that you need to take REALLY good care of,ROCKSTAR pants,silvery high-heels,and a headset/mic. Hope this review helps you! :)"
1,BRATZ are better,"[...]Bratz are the top fashions queens in the world today! I LOVE them! I have a TON of them! I USED to like My Scene, but then i discovered their pure ugliness! Don't buy My Scene, because they are a copy of the beautiful, wonderful and creative Bratz dolls! My Scene dolls are U-G-L-Y! The Bratz dolls are actually pretty and have neat themes! Don't buy My Scene, because you are wasting your time and money on these selfish, ugly, dumb dolls! They don't even have cool clothes! The outfits are plain BOARING!!!!!!!"
1,copy cats,"I know that my scene lovers are not going to like this review but i seriously think that my scene dolls are trying to copy the ""Bratz"" dolls, i mean, who came first? I think you'll find the bratz did.This doll is quite attractive i'll give it that, but they are trying to get people to buy the doll because of the dvd. I think that is way out, people should buy the doll becauase they like the doll! Bratz don't need any stupid dvd to sell their dolls, and look how many dolls they've sold!I think that you should miss out on any dolls (including this one) that come with a dvd, they're just trying to bribe you in to buying it.Thankyou for reading."
4,Good Deal!,I bought this when it was on sale for 5.29 and free shipping! I just have to say it was a great deal. My daughter loves anything Barbie and for that price I couldn't pass it up. It came with a DVD that she watches over and over.
2,Hmmmm...,This is definately NOT my favorite Nolee doll.Even though Masquerade Madness is one of my fave sets this Nolee just can not make it. I suggest Shopping Spree Nolee or My Scene gose Hollywood Nolee. [...]
2,fade away compilation,"this compilation is a classic fade away album. the first song, ""writing it down for you"" by pop unknown is a classic ""emo"" song. it sets the bar quite high. unfortunately, the bar is only topped once throughout the rest of the album. it is topped in the track ""holly park"" by brandston. i am prejudiced since this is one of my favourite bands, but they recorded the best song of their career (barring anything yet to come). the melody and one of the best harmony duos carry this song through somewhat depressing lyrical content (being apart from the one you love). from this point on (track five), the album fades into oblivion. there is nothing of import to comment on. the songs do nothing to separate themselves from the typical ""emo"" fare. however, it is worth the buy for the brandston track (unless you can find the ""holly park/black boys on mopeds"" seven inch)."
1,Boring,This movie is bland and dry and I read Idiot's guide to the modern middle east instead (and it is much better) The graphics are okay and the narrator is poor.
5,great for the price,"great price, easy to install - I DID have to purchase screws that would fit my projector for its mounting but for this price, I was not put off."
5,Universal projector mount,"Definetely would recommend to anyone with a projector. Versatile, easy to install and it contains many diferent screws to fit any projector. Great buy at a great price."
4,K.I.S.,Need a simple ceiling projector mount for your conference room or multifunction room? This is it; after doing some research decided on the Vantage Point product and had our projector installed in less than 30 min. Two small points for improvement:1) They need better instructions. There was not enough explanation on what parts to use with different projectors.2) Easier fine tune adjustments for aiming the projector.Overall for the money a great projector mount.
5,True universal mount,"I looked at some cheaper mounts but I found there were people who had to modify the cheaper mounts to get them to work properly. I wanted a mount which didn't require a dremel and skill.This Vantage point mount was somewhat easy to put together, its low to the ceiling and comes with the needed wrench. The mount is more than enough for my projectorVivitek D512-3D 2600 Lumen SVGA HDMI 120 Hz 2D to 3D Portable DLP Projectorso I don't have any issues. Just make sure you follow the easy directions."
4,"Great look, high build quality","This is one of the best looking projector mounts I've seen. It is very adaptable, and the quality of materials and construction is very good. Installation was easy, although fine tuning the projector angles took some time. The projector is stable and secure on this mount.I give an A+ to Vantage Point--I called them before I bought this to see if it would work for a projector (NEC NP2000) with 4 mounting points instead of 3. They said it would, but they happily sent an extra set of arms and mounting hardware for me to use, free of charge! And they sent it before I even purchased the unit from Amazon. They also have a great website.Cons:- Doesn't have a quick release- One of the adjustment screws is already starting to strip because I've made a lot of adjustments--maybe I'm just cranking down too tightly."
3,Confusing installation and didn't fit my small projector,"I bought this because it said ""Universal"" but it wasn't quite universal. I have a small optoma projector (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DUCKNK/ref=oss_product) with only three screw mount holes in the bottom. I found no way to mount my projector and had to return this item.It seemed like a fine product if it fits your machine."
4,She is the best,"Antonella Ruggiero is the best italian singer, she have a wonderful voice. Now you have to buy the new album ""SOSPESA"" . That's great!"
2,Farberware toaster,"It's good that this toaster is not available. It worked fair, tended to fry the top of the toast a little hard. Then it quit working, the lever wouldn't stay down. Looks cheaply made."
2,Disappointment,"I purchased this toaster, because of rating given it by America's Test Kitchen. They rated it the best one they tested. If this is the best, then the rest of the toasters must be terrible. It did not perform for me as indicated by the folks at the Test Kitchen. I have used it for about 4 months."
4,Toasts and defrosts very well,"Bought this toaster because it was the highest rated toaster by Cooks Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen. I have never been steered the wrong way by their reviews. This toaster is no exception, it toasts very evenly and has a handy and effective defrost button that can turn frozen bread into perfect toast witht he press of a button."
2,Toaster is not that hot,The toaster is cool to the touch but not very consistent in its toasting ability.
5,A taste of Heaven,"This recording is a little taste of heaven. I especially love the morning coffee on the porch with ""Your Presence is the Greatest Gift of All"" to the heartfelt letter written to a suckling baby in ""Friends for a Lifetime"" This is not Bluegrass Religion. Come share Claire's real walk with Jesus."
4,Can anyone help me????,I really enjoy listening to this CD. I would like to know how to go about getting sound tracks from this CD. Any help anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated.
2,Religious music is free at church.,"It doesn't sound this good though. I bought the CD thinking that it was going to be more of the lively and indefinable stuff of ""Silver and Gold"".I was wrong--but what is living with no mistakes?"
3,Bad Binding,"This is indeed a must have for classical guitar players. However, be warned that the binding is NOT spiral (as indicated in other reviews), but ""perfect"" binding (i.e. glued to the backing) which for sheet music is the least perfect binding there is."
4,Mel Bay Complete Sor Studies for Guitar,"There's not too much one can say about this. As every classical guitarist knows, Sor was one of the greatest composers of music for the guitar. Even his simple etudes (the ones I can actually play) are both fun and interesting to play as well as for others to listen to, and each one contains valuable, practical, guitaristic challenges for the aspiring beginner.My only complaint about this book and it is a serious one, is that it should have spiral binding. I'll probably go somewhere and have it done as it absolutely won't stay open unless other books hold down the edges of the pages.So, it's 5 stars for Sor, 2 stars for the lack of spiral binding, and I guess that makes 4 stars."
4,Complete and practical,"This compilation is organized by Opus and provides a complete set of the Sor studies. It is easy to navigate if you are familiar with the organization of these works or read Grimes' brief introduction. The spiral binding is a huge asset missing in so many music books. It sits on the stand open to any page obligingly, and turning pages is easy! That practicality, alone, makes the Mel Bay series a cut above most of the others."
3,NOT SPIRAL BOUND,"Great book for a student/teacher experience. Not so great for the self-taught. I can read music,but I had hoped this book would indicate right hand usage(pima).Right hand usage is my biggest obstacle.Also there is no cd with this book which is also very helpful to get the feel for a piece of music.And lastly,this book IS NOT spiral bound. It is a glued stiff type which is the WORST!! Great book, but lacking right hand guidance"
5,My Favorite Guitar Book,"I've been playing the guitar for 3 years and this is my favorite music book. The pieces are fine for a near novice. This assumes the ability to read music. My only criticism is that he did not compose for as many voices as other composers. It is only rarely that 4 notes are played at once, but at my skill level, this really isn't much of an issue."
1,Practice Management for the Dental Team,"This book is terribly outdated. You know they have done a poor job updating the textbook when they say, ""Be familiar with telegraph services and know how to prepare a telegram and count chargeable words and characters."" There was no advice regarding electronic charting but they still dedicate 1/4 of the textbook to paper charting. As a technologically advanced individual, this was a painful read."
4,"pricey, but sturdy - limited features","This thing is solid. It has the same brains as Melnor's like it, but I've gone through 2 of those in 1 year. The Gardena promises to be a long-term fix, for just 30% more in cost. However, the features are limited - that is, I want to water 3 times a day (morning, noon, and early evening). This only divides the # cycles into the 24 hour period equally, so 3 times a day means one cycle happens in the middle of the night. That only fosters fungal growth.Watering at 6AM and 6PM twice as long seems to work out okay."
5,Gardena 3-Cycle Electronic Water Timer,Product works great. The Melnor products I had before did not last. This product works on the old batteries from the Melnor. Another great feature is you can remove the programmer from the rest of the device without disconnecting anything for hard to reach areas.
5,This one is the best.,"Over the years I had 3 other kind, they were dropping like flies.This one is working dutifully.Don't waste your money on those cheap ones, get this one.Simply works day after day and this is what you want.:-)"
3,it sucked! literally!!!,"there was no love story behind this film, just a man murdering everyone. I probably wouldn't recommend this video to anyone except to those that have nothing to do."
3,Just what happened to all the mystery I read in the novel?,"In the original 1911 novel I hired from the Library a few weeks ago, I could'nt belive how it spooked me with all the mystery about the Phantom.This version totally forgets about that and just seems to concentrate on the evil things that lurk in the shadows and stuff! PLEASE!"
4,Whee!,"I really remember watching this when I was little. I was a huge shipper of Phantom of the Opera and I had seen the actual musical, but I bought this and I really liked it. Now if I watch it, I do notice the animation is a little bad and it's actually rather strange, I still like it. It gets the basic idea across. Yay."
5,Wild Ravens -a vivid and memorable tale,Great read! The author shows great knowledge and command of word use. She is a very vivid and descriptive writer. Ms Washington makes one feel as though they are there with the characters. The story is creative and clever. I will never look at 'blackberries' without reflecting on this book!!Too bad the publisher/editor didn't catch their errors!
3,"Fun... but too ""happy""","The sounds are fun... but the songs, which would seem""latin"" style... are made too much into the Dance andFreestyle Style of music. Most of them sound like rip-offs of otherpopular songs. Though the CD is still great for listening and stuff,try to get a used CD ...Number 3 however --> Fruta Fresca isincredible!"
2,Singer ruins CD,"On the positive side, the band has a hilarious name, and the music is just good meat-and-potatos old-school hard rock. However, the singer may be one of the worst in the business. He sounds like he is gargling and doesn't realize somebody turned on the microphone. This band could be pretty decent if they'd get a singer who wasn't trying to snork a big rubbery luggie while singing each song."
1,Opened box,"This is open box(not new). The board wasn't sealed in plastic, length is variy(shortest one is 1/3 of longest one), 2 more ponds weight then described, groov don't march well, put them together, their not even flat, color is much darker then picture shows.I order one carton for repair my floor.My carpenter suggest me return it due to the quality. But seller refuse my return request due to the polices about no return under 4 carton. I feel I was tricked.Make sure your order is not open one,because the board sharp could chang a lot."
3,Great To See Kurt McKinney after all these Years!!!!,"After reading an article about this film, I had wanted to see it for the last 10 years because of the fact that I hadn't seen the wonderful Kurt McKinney since 'No Retreat No Surrender', and liked Cynthia Rothrock after seeing her in 'China O'Brien'.I wasn't dissapointed. Since being a fan of marital arts and martial arts movies, I liked this film a lot.If you are a martial arts fan, you will likely enjoy this movie."
4,It's a good game,"Hamsterz life is a fun game with lots of neat things to do and places to go. I think that any kid who likes animals, especially hamsters, will enjoy this game."
4,DS Hamsterz instead of a real hamster,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She asked Santa for NDS and a hamster. There was no way I was going to buy a real hamster for her, so I thought that this was a good alternative. She loved it and has figured out most of the features of the game on her own. FYI, the game requires some reading but she figured it out what to do after I read the bits once/twice."
2,"No ""Ham-Country""","Before I got this game, I thought it looked kinda cute. When I played it, it was okay, but pretty boring overall. You can teach your hamster to talk, which was kind of fun but sometimes I said one thing, and it thought I said another thing. Also, in order to play the mini games, you have to wait for your hamster to want to play and then it picks a mini game and a difficulty. The biggest dissapointment was the Ham-country. There isn't one. After I played it for a while, I couldn't find anything about the ham country in the game booklet or in the game. I looked at some sites, and other reviewers said there is no ham country, and it was a misprint. Overall, this game was a huge dissapointment, but still a little fun if you like taking care of vitual pets."
2,Disappointed,"Yes the Hamsterz are cute...but after a while they do and say the same things, and nothing new really happens after you've acquired all of the items. You can teach them to play with a toy, only to find that a minute later they have forgotten how to, and you have to sit there and wait for them to figure it out all over again. You can pet and brush them and make them happy, then when you try these things again a little later, they run away from you and their happiness meter drops to zero again. It makes no sense why these things happen and it's very frustrating! I've put hours and hours and HOURS into this game, expecting one day to find my Hamsterz built a ""Ham-Country"", but this never happens. Actually, you can only play with one hamster at a time in the cage and they can never interact with each other. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed."
3,More like Ham-burgled,"As a huge fan of hamsters and DS games that simulate pet ownership, I was extremely excited when I first saw an article on this game in EGM (""Ubisoft Unveils Latest Halo Killer"").Unfortunately, as happens so often, the game just didn't live up to the hype, and it was entirely because of the absence of any kind of Ham-Country. This game could have been like a million times more awesome if they just gave you some kind of hamster wheel or maybe one of those bottles with a ball bearing in the nozzle. Man, that would have been sweet!Sigh. Thinking about what could have been just makes my disappointment all the more bitter."
4,Better than expected,"I wanted this game for a while, and, of course, reading the Amazon reviews gave me seconnd thought. Even though there may not be a Ham-Country, the game is still fun all-in-all. I think people who like Nintendogs will like it best, because it's quite like it.To be honest, I got bored with Nintendogs after a while, but it's one of those games where you sorta 're-discover' it after a bit and play it again.That's what I'm thinking this game is like. I've only had it for a few days, so I can't give you a completely acurate low-down on how long it takes to get boring.But, personally, I still think there is a Ham-Country, because my friend told me she has it. Maybe she has the Japanese version, (she can speak it) because I've been told Ham-Country exists in LoveLove Hamster.But all in all, the game will be fun for people who are into either animals or Nintedogs.-RileyP.S. I only gave it 4 stars cause' it doesnt have the makings of a 5 star game."
5,Hamsterz Life is the Best,"My 10 year old dau. loves this game. She enjoys taking care of her ""hamster"" and bringing him to life. The item was priced appropriately, shipped, and well received by all."
3,Kids love it,"I got this game for my daughter, which is 8 yrs old. She loves it...She shows me new things every time she plays with it. I think its pretty cool!!!! That's my opion.....Peace out!Dukeblue1"
3,Not as much fun as NintenDogs,"My 10-year-old daughter says that you can't do as much with the Hamsters on this game as you can with the dogs on NintenDogs, so it's not as much fun for her. NintenDogs-Lab & Friends is her favorite."
4,You just didnt play long enough!,"My BFF has this game for over 2 months, and she has the playcround! The truth though, is this: its really just furniture to use. . . you people are crazy, play the game longer!!!!! C' mon! play the game and THEN WRITE! not meaning to be rude, but Duh!"
5,Fascinating and Frightening,"Jean Kilbourne does an excellent job of taking you through the mindfield of advertising. I was shocked to learn that America is one of the few countries to allow advertising directed at kids and after reading this book, I know why it is outlawed in most places. Throughout this well developed and researched book, I found myself shocked and stunned -- and that's not easy to do to me.Everyone should take a look at this book. The insidious nature of advertising is made apparent and if you think you aren't impacted by advertising then you truly should read this book. Fascinating and frightening."
2,Book seemed over-zealous,"I bought this book for part of a book club reading list. And to be honest I just never really got behind the authors argument. In my opinion she was a bit over zealous about the great evils and impact of advertising, and she was never really able to convince me (the reader) to side with her opinion. Instead I just thought she was over-reacting and that she didn't have enough research/data to support her arguments. But then again I was reading this as part of a book club and even from the beginning this topic was never really in my area of interest so I may have been tougher on it then someone more interested in the perils of advertising."
5,Great Book! Great Author!,"I am a big fan of Jean Kilbourne and her work. This book is great and insightful. If you liked her ""killing us softly"" presentation then you will love this book too. Some of the ads she talks about are included in the book which is nice."
4,Anti-Comsumerist Cocktail Party Converstaion Piece,"I like the book. It is perfect material for an anti-consumerist like myself and a quick lesson in the mind-messing of marketing. I am a much better sleuth at determining what an advertiser wants me to want. It's tricky and many tricks are revealed in this book, which is what i like to arm myself with. The author is well-credentialed and has a smooth, conversational, style, like a funny professor. Some parts seem to be numerous examples of the same thing. The pictures are fun and racy. It is not a page turner, but worth the time."
5,EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK,My title says it all. It's very informative and allows the reader to understand why she/he thinks about and responds to american culture in certain ways. Very eye opening.
3,Cosmetic Psychology,"Jean Kilbourne has some important points to make in this book. Yet, thanks to her ability to use similar tactics of the ad industry to get her own agenda across, the inclination is to believe her rhetoric as much as her opponent's (i.e. the 'bad' ad industry). Were 'bad habits' and other disorders truly 'forced upon her by ads' when she was young? And do they explain her own modus operandi now? Ads certainly may appeal to our own personal myths, aspirations and be useful tools to promote our own denial and insecurities. But their role as tools or mediums should not be confused with the actual agent or culprit in initiating and continuiung deception and denial. Thus, reading her book gave me the impression that Kilbourne was still struggling -- trying to find her own way out of an all encompassing cosmetic world in which she actually, deep down secretively, believes too literally."
4,Mini- Review,"Mini- ReviewIn review of the book I'm reading Can't Buy My Love is about advertising. It doesn't discriminate women as much as I thought it would. It discriminates the advertising world. Jean Kilbourne, (the author) talks about how advertising influences all different kinds of people: blacks, whites, males, females, adults, and children.Jean Kilbourne really goes in depth with the way she portrays the advertising world. People spend millions of dollars trying to get their commercials on T.V. "" You can love it without getting your heart broken."" Some company probably paid a lot of money just to get that quote on T.V., or in a magazine.This is the only book I've read in a long time, I really enjoyed it.Can't Buy My Love is an informative book about the advertising world."
4,"For an Outsider, Great; for an Insider, a Review","This book appears to be a manual used in Sunday school classes taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If you are familiar with the church (as I am, having been raised in the religion), there is little surprising here. The book is a straightforward rendering of the doctrines of the church. Still, I found it to be a nice ""refresher"" course, written in an accesible style. The book would probably be best for an outsider--that is, someone unfamiliar with the religion who wanted to learn more. Although the book was written almost a century ago, it is still very ""current"" and applicable. The wording may have changed a bit in the 21st century, but the doctrines and policies remain essentially the same."
3,Not a biography of the city,"I quite liked this book. It's an interesting approach to E.M. Forster, C. Cavafy, and Lawrence Durrell and their time in Alexandria. However, as someone complained, based on the title, it would seem that Alexandria would be the focus of the book rather than these writers. The literary biography is fine. If you're looking for a biography of the city, look elsewhere."
5,Wonderful Discovery,"I discovered this book quite by accident after purchasing Haag's book ""Alexandria Illustrated."" I am a long-time Durrell and Cavafy fan and am so pleased to have found a source of information about both that is so interesting and readable. The highlight are the wonderful old photos, none of which I had ever seen before. This text provides an inside look and feel for the lives of these interesting people at a very unique place and time in history. It is not a guidebook; Haag has written numerous other books that are excellent guide books."
2,Too short in the torso,"This was a From Me,To Me Christmas present. I wanted the very warm outdoor coverall and it is just that. Like all Carhartt it's very well built, but the 44R I purchased didn't fit. I couldn't raise my arms without the crotch cinching up. I went to a local store and tried on a 46Tall and I had the same problem. I was disappointed that I couldn't find another size that would fit me so I ended up returning it to amazon."
1,Don't buy it.,"I bought this CD a month ago, and it is not entertaining at all. All the songs are quite similar and he is an italian-wannabe. If you wanna have an italian look, then go so in Italy, not in Latin America."
2,Not my style,"I made the unfortunate mistake of confusing this with the downtempo/triphop act ""Hybrid Device"". The more ""techno-house"" oriented tracks don't really fit the type of music I spin. I have no idea why this record popped up on my ""Trip-hop"" search."
2,Too one-dimensional,"The Queen Mother is indeed a ""splendid old bird,"" worthy of the love and affection of her people but this book is too cloying in the beginning to be a good biography. The book does get better after the first 100 pages but there is no depth to this biography; no examination of the flawed side of this remarkable woman. She does have her flaws and these should be in a well-balanced biography. She is, after all, a human being and not a goddess."
5,"Scary, horrific, and suspenseful that's what this one reader is saying...","Hi,I used to watch ""Tales From The Darkside"" (the series) as a child and found it to be delightfully scary, but not too scary. The series consisted of 90 episodes, all of which, were completely different, but usually had ironic twists at the end. The monsters, or the villains at the end of the show usually had the last laugh as opposed to the generic good guys winning!It was scary, but not too scary.It would be great if the current company, who owns the licensing rights to the series would release it on DVD in seasonal box sets.*(Recommended for adults due to adult themes (e.g., scary) might scare younger children).*"
2,These were great,"I had to make my reply about this...I too would love to see this as a DVD set. I too remember watching this and it was not too scary and I was child..I remember some even being funny. One that still come to mind is about a women that was trying to lose weight...she mailed ordered these ""special glasses"" and her food was talking to her...some thing like that...can't quite remember..as it was a long time ago...but it was funny..I hope they do consider putting these out on DVD..I got on here checking for that reason.. hoping to buy them."
1,Dangerous-don't buy!,"This mirror is dangerous-had one for a few months and the head piece holding the mirrors fell to the floor and shattered all over my bathroom. The flaw is that that the mirror head is not attached to the stand in any way. There are merely two ""dimples"" in the metal ring around the mirrors where the end of the stand arms hold the head by pressure and friction. If you spin the mirror around too fast or hard, (or in my case just I guess it just wore out) it can slip out of the arms and you have a disaster. This item should be recalled."
4,Works like a charm,"Bought a similar product from a different vendor - big mistake. Should know better and stick with Amazon vendors from the beginning. Item was received ahead of schedule, was in good condition when received, and was easy to assemble. Would buy from this vendor again."
2,terrible special features,"I've been waiting for a special edition of House on Haunted Hill for awhile now. The special features are listed as ""90 minutes long"" and include the following:1. less than 5 minutes of a fan talking about Carol Ohmart (1 minute of it is with Jack Hill). Waste of time.2. less than 5 minutes of the same fan talking about very well known facts about the house in the movie. Waste of time.3. over 80 minutes of trailers and a terrible quality willian castle tv spot. Waste of time.The only reason to buy this is for the cool dvd art. Nothing else.Maybe one day we'll see a special edition dvd worth buying. Until then, don't double dip on this one."
4,pretty good for the time,I thought that this movie was better then what i expected. The ending is the only thing that i would critize. Some of the moments were actually funny but other than that a move i could watch again.
3,Vincent Price double feature,"The version of House on Haunted Hill that I own is the Diamond Entertainment version paired with Last Man on Earth. Both are fully restored, and House is in widescreen. House on Haunted Hill is a typically hamfisted William Castle misfire which does start out well (the opening scene of Price awaiting his guests is particularly well-done) but soon degenerates into one awkward shock moment after another. NOTE: Why do some directors think that a woman's piercing screams every five minutes make a film scary? Last Man on Earth is a low-budget Italian version of Richard Matheson's SF classic I Am Legend, about the last normal man in a world of vampires. Though not perfect, it is far superior to the '70s Charlton Heston version, and is worth seeing, especially for Price's haunting performance and some effective moments of horror. The rating reflects two stars for House and four stars for Last Man."
3,"Tasty, just not filling enough",Like the other reviewers I think the dialogue is great and a decent story line but this movie is a like a good tasting meal but just not enough of it to leave you feeling satisfied.....The ending was not strong at all and the storyline could have been more developed.
3,House on Haunted Hill,"I enjoyed this movie even for an old one it kept me entertained I wasn't as scard as I wanted to be, an oldy and a goody."
3,"2.5 Stars as horror, but 5 for a great movie","I'm rating this as a horror flick. Five strangers gather to test their stamina, Price hands each of them delightfully twisted party favors (loaded handguns, delivered in their own tiny coffins), and the spook show begins. Blood drips from the ceiling, zombielike apparitions float through rooms, severed heads and skeletons suddenly appear, and then a guest is found hanging in the stairwell. There are a few good jolts, but this isn't very scary, but it is a heck of alot scarier than the pathetic re-make. It also has a sense of humor. This is one that the whole family will enjoy. Watch it in the dark, and BUY IT now!"
3,Not too bad,"It was definitely not like the new one. It had very little special effects but was a lot more realistic. Made me jump once, so I'm impressed. It is old and shows it in the somewhat plotkilling soundtrack. Acting is good, and the plot is easy to follow along to. Same basic story as the new one, except toned down a whole lot, but is not missing anything. Watch if you're more into a mystery/thriller."
3,house on haunted hill(colar+b&w),i thought for a classic that it was very good and suspensful and that they should make some of the old classics like this and holiday inn in colar without changing any thig but color.~redneck beauty~
2,"Two stars for Price, not the film","Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) invites five strangers to spend the night in a haunted house...if they can. However, all is not as it seems. Price, as always, is wonderful and adds some much needed class to this substandard outing, which basically consists of the cast wandering from room to room, delivering bad dialogue and reacting hysterically to tired haunted house cliches. Lovers of campy grade-B 50s horror films may feel charitable toward it."
3,HOKEY FUN,"A lot of baby boomers seem to hold this campy ""horror"" movie in high esteem. This is such an incredibly hokey film that it's actually been hailed as a cult classic! Richard Long, (remember Jarrod Barkley in THE BIG VALLEY?) Carolyn Craig and others are invited to spend the night in a supposedly haunted house; 10,000 dollars will be paid to anyone who can survive the night there. When the movie was originally released, Castle had in-theatre skeletons dangling over the audience's heads! A fondly remembered but really harmless (campared to today's standards) little flick."
3,"The Master of Gimmicks' take on "" The Cat And The Canary""","...I found the DVD played better on its second run...William Castle's classic was his first collaboration with horror legend Vincent Price. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is a surprisingly gentle (mainly) mystery in which millionaire Frederick Loren (Price) offers seven people-four men and three women-$10,000 to attend the birthday party of his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart). The catch is that the party is an all night affair held in a haunted mansion that has already claimed the lives of seven people: four men and three women...The fun includes blood dripping from the ceiling, hilarious mummified white-haired apparitions, a severed head in a suitcase and guns cased in miniature coffins as ""party favors"" and of course, the walking skeleton. Not scary, but a good ""horror"" for family audiences. The extras on the DVD I viewed were pretty basic, just bios & filmographys for Castle and Price..."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I saw this movie for the first time tonight, and I must say I liked it. It's not the best movie I've ever seen nor is it the scariest, but it is a good way to kill 75 minutes. I'm probably the only person under 18 who enjoys this one more than the remake."
5,House on Hauted Hill mixes horror and mystery.,"This movie is great!! I have seen very few horror movies, but this is the best!! My teacher showed it to us on Halloween. It is so scary the girls sitting behind me blew my eardrums out with their screams. Yet it has mystery, It left my classmates and I wondering 'till the end of the movie. I would give this movie 4 stars, and two thumbs up. If you ask me, or anyone in Mr.H's class at Hunters Glen Elemantry we would all say get this movie!!"
4,Interesring,The story kept your interest even though it did not have all thehigh tech kismos of todays movies.
4,The Ghosts are Walking Tonight,"Effective little 8 reel 'old dark house' chiller from the gimmicky William Castle. The gaping holes and inconsistencies of the plot don't seem to matter as you wait for the next 'shock' moment. Nice performances all round, with Vincent Price and the ever reliable Elisha Cook, Jr, hamming it up like crazy. All the staple ingredients are there, from severed heads, to a bath of acid. Not as good on a TV screen as in a darkened cinema, with the skeletal 'Emergo' being trundled across the auditorium on its often squeaky wire. But the wonderfully 'ghostly' theme and incidental music works every time. Good to watch around midnight, alone, and with the lights out."
2,"Good movie, terrible sound quality","Movie rating: 3 starsSound quality: 1 star (Note: This review is of the Silver Screams DVD release).William Castle's classic ""gentle"" horror in which millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) offers five people $10,000 if they survive a night in a haunted house. I'm sure if you buy this from Amazon, you'll be fine. I just thought I'd better let Australasian readers know that they should avoid the Mira Entertainment DVD release of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL as you can't hear a thing. I had to turn the volume on my TV and DVD player up to max, and I still couldn't hear it. This really annoyed me as I'm a huge Vincent Price fan. But don't let this put you off buying other Mira DVDs. I have several more DVDs distributed by them and the sound quality is fine. Just avoid HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. Buy it here instead."
4,the house on haunted hill,this is good butt you have to be a fan of vincent price its kinda dull butt has moments you may like alot so .
4,House on Haunted Hill,House on Haunted Hill is a late 50's horror movie starring the immortal Vincent Price in the role as an eccentric millionaire who throws a ghost party to seven guests. The special effects are campy and the story line goes well together with this kind of campy horror movies. Vincent Price is just right for the role as the eccentric creepy millionaire type and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. 4/5.
3,what really scares you?,"""The House on Haunted Hill"" is one of the those older horror movies that relies more on the creeking of doors and shadows to get results with its viewers. Unlike, the horror movies of today which are mostly just gore fests. This was more of a comedy, actually, just because the effects and some of the writing was so hoky.Still, it stars Vincent Price who is the owner of the House on the haunted hill, and he is in his true zone of acting in it. He is mostly known for movies like this.The effects and props for the ""scary"" scenes were more funny than anything, but it's the scenes where you hear a door creeking or those moments where you wonder what's on the other side of that curtain that really make you jump.At just over an hour, this is a great movie to watch during the month of Halloween. It is even good for older children."
5,"Anybody wanna make 10,000 dollars?","This is one of my absolute favorites. Vincent Price RULED the horror world in the late 50's and ALL of the 60's. This is the premise of the film: Frederick Loren (Price) invites 5 people to come to a haunted house to stay overnight to make 10,000 dollars. Pretty easy, right? Only if you have nerves of steel. This movie keeps you one the edge of your seat the whole time, and you'll never guess who's really causing all the mayhem!! I recommend this film to anyone who wants a really good old fashioned horror to watch on a Saturday afternoon. It's just a great film."
4,Awesome movie,"First off, I'm 13, and love old classic movies. This is a GREAT movie! It's not that scary, but there are PLENTY of jump scenes to keep you nervous. My favorite part of the movie is where Vincent Price gets even w/ his wife. The characters are described pretty well in the beginning, so you get to know them quite well. Buy this movie! You'll enjoy it! I do! - A Fan"
1,RIP OFF ALERT!!,Whatever you DON'T BUY THIS ITEM! Nothing about it is enhanced. The picture quality is horrible and the packaging sucks! This is a rip off. If you want this movie on dvd buy the one released by Warner Bros. This dvd is horrible. The label is uneven because someone printed it from a printer and dvd is home made. The whole thing is homemade. I was very disappointed.
2,"Not scary, but I still loved it 1.5 stars as horror","I have to rate this as a horror film. I think it was actually ment to be a black comedy, and viewed in that since, it's great."
1,Dumb Movie About VERY Dumb People,"Dispite the presence of the fantastic Vicent Price...this movie looks like a high school play...People stuck in a so called Haunted House and yet go wandering off by themselves and putting themselves in danger..I can see the script for Carolyn Craig...""lighty scream"" 'BIG SCREAM' 'light scream' 'unfinished scream'...It is so bad, it would a great film to rent for a party and just sit and make fun of it..."
5,AN EEEEERIE CLASSIC,AN OLD FAVORITE OF MINE. (not that i'm old) PRICE IS GREAT AS ALWAYS. A MUST SEE FOR A GOOD SCARE. BE CAREFUL OF DARK BASEMENTS.
3,slightly disappointed,it it came in good condition but the movie had a green line going through it the whole time. very distracting not even the original movie had that.
3,Pistachio,"I give this rating because my daughter has watched this with my 3 year old grandson. She said there are a couple of parts that frightened him a bit. We will save this DVD until he is older and then he won't be frightened. My grandsons love VeggieTales--we have many DVDs. The stories are great, offer good morals that teach and entertain as well. We are very pleased with the messages that are taught to our grandchildren and we will be happy when more ""LarryBoy"" DVDs are out--LarryBoy is the favorite hero around our houses."

2,GEORGIA PEACHES,"This is the title of the European version of Corman's TV pilot ""Georgia Peaches."" The story is about a moonshiner (Dirk Benedict) driving a hot Trans-Am being able to out run the local cops and roadblocks in a town where everybody knows everybody and they all go to the dentist regularly to have their teeth whitened.

1,King Kong V-Rex,The price for this toy was unbelievably high. I thought this would be bigger than it was. I should have paid more attention to the stats of this item. I would not have purchased it had I known.
3,Not THAT bad.,My son loves this toy. Yes it does fall apart (just like it's supposed to) but it does stand on it's own. Not as good as the other figures but a necessary part of our collection.
1,Agree with other bad reviews,"This toy is not fun for a little person. It won't stay together at all; even when you turn the crank to tighten the strings, it is still too loose. And the head is not straight unless you hold it in the correct position. My 4.5 yr. old got it for Christmas and is disappointed."
4,Zits - Busted,"More classics. No surprises here - if you have or have had teenagers you will recognize each agonizing moment. A few ""pre sketches"" which are interesting to see the cartoonist's way of working. Otherwise simply a compilation of the strips seen each weekend in the Sunday papers. Be warned if you follow them each week you may have seen these before. However they are magic - catching the angst and bathos of parents with teenagers. I am not sure how teenagers will take this - will they be self aware enough to recognize themselves. Might be worth a try if they feel they are the only ones to agonize over a zit, the first date, first bust up - the driver's test..."
5,An important guide to today's hottest topic,"Absolutely objective. Wonderfully insightful. Footmarked to the hilt.This is the most useful, objective, engaging source I've found on the topic."
1,THE WORST ONE!!!!!!,I own (now) all 4 of the Bring it on movies and I have to say that this one is the worst one of them all!!!! I'm lucky I won it free on a website instead of wasting my money buying it.
3,Be Careful,"I purchased this movie for my middle school daughter who loves cheerleading. Although the movie had a great overall theme about the importance of being able to set aside differences and work together to accomplish a goal, the language in the movie was terrible! There was a lot of name calling and strong foul language. The movie would have been an A+ with all of the great dance routines and cheer moves, had they not included the use of horrendous words."
2,West Side Story in a cheer version,"In the movie they basicly tried to put West Side Story into a cheer version. It went wrong.Oh, so wrong."
3,Better than the 2nd not the 1st or 3rd,"This Bring it On was Okay. I really liked the cheer and dance moves but other than that, it was pretty weak to me. I was no where near as good as the first or third but waaay better than the second."
4,Delicious Campy Fun,"It's deliciously campy. From climbing on mailboxes, to massive ""impromptu"" cheer offs, to the whole ""My parents will never understand my cheering!"". Don't expect to be moved by massive hugfests or tearfests, if you go in ready to laugh at some of the most ridiculous lines you've heard, ""J-E-T-S, Jets rule from east to west"" at lunch tables or to be amazing by stunts and gymnastics they pull then this is for you. Overall, while I wouldn't buy this movie, I can definitely see a massive cheer montage on youtube of this and this would be a great Friday night girls-in movie.General NotesThe whole dumb girl and mean girl relation is getting really old.What is with the rat tail? No one does that.Finally, don't expect to be remotely moved by any character or inspired, but expect to laugh, and that's what you'll get through this movie.Enjoy!"
1,Disappointed!,"This might have been a cool movie, but I couldn't tell from this DVD. Although obviously shot in widescreen, the image here is cropped to a boxy square and looks faded and beat up. It was so bad I didn't even bother to finish watching the movie. My advice would be to wait for a proper DVD release."
1,queen of the nile,Super low quality ! From cover to dvd. Sinister cinima is not a place I will ever do business with . I felt ripped off.I would not be so upset if I had only paid a dollar . There should be a quality rating on items .
2,Ancient Egyptophile,"As anything, good, bad or indifferent on Ancient Egypt interests me, this was my reason for purchasing this product. Beautiful as she was, Jeanne Crain is hardly anybody's idea of a queen of the Nile. Resemblence to actual history was purely accidental, but I was entertained and what better reason for watching a sword and sandal epic?"
1,Sinister Studios -- That's an Understatement,"Frankly, I am always interested in seeing old films (the Kitchier the better). But I also like quality. Sinister has claimed to be the directors and to have the rights to these films, but they do no justice to them with the poor quality of the reproduction. Also, they do not represent themselves in a straight forward manner. They should state in the description of the film who they are, what they do, what rights they have and then give a synopsis of the film itself. That way, no one can mistake the film they order to be a direct release from the studio. I believe they are acting in an underhanded way."
2,Not for ancient Egypt buffs,"I am a classic movie buff and enjoy watching any film to do with ancient Egypt. But I was not quite enthralled by this version of Queen Nefertiti. Both Jean Crain and Edmund Pardom's acting was quite wooden at times, with the worst from Vincent Price who was completely miscat in the role of a priest. The dialogue was not brilliant either. I found, on the whole, entertaining in that it was about ancient Egypt, but for those who are not quite so enthusiastic, then I would definitely give this film a miss."
5,Beautiful photography of restored Spitfires.,"This is one of my favorite Spitfire books. It has striking color photography of restored Spitfires in flight. Very current. Very nicely written, it traces the background of surviving aircraft, present ownership etc. It is quite comprehensive. There are a very few flyable Spitfires in the world that are not covered here. J. Campbell ""Cam"" Martin"
3,Unappealing production,"Musically, this production was fine. But I disagree with the fans who liked the look and updating. I found it visually unappealing, and dramatically uninteresting. Some design elements are colorful and eye-catching, but most just look cheap, flimsy, and unattractive. The cast often seemed lost for direction. Many updated productions work well, but this one strains itself to the breaking point to find some 1960s analog for every possible element, even when something traditional would work fine (or better). By way of example, instead of giving Dorabella his portrait, Ferrando writes an ""F"" in magic marker on her bra. Later, instead of a locket, she gets a big plastic heart pendant with a flashing light inside.If this DVD seems interesting, I'd suggest renting it, not buying. It's more of a one-off novelty production than something of enduring interest."
5,Masterful,"I found myself surfing around for some new chilled out tunes tonight and this double set presented itself. I've had this for some time now and it is my favorite compilation to date (followed closely by ""The Very Best Euphoric Chillout Breakdown"" (2001 & 2002 sets). It touches and inspires in ways that are difficult to describe and that I don't fully comprehend. The compilation is like the ebb and flow of energy through everything that is. If one takes the time to slow down enough to appreciate that they are not separate from but a part of, then this set of music will slowly work its way into your soul where it will always remain. The yearning and intensity from Tracy Ackerman's vocals on No Ordinary Morning is truly a priceless gift. An incredible Set of Music!"
3,Best of Chillout Hits,This is a good CD.I bought it on a whim and found that it has very good and relaxing music on both discs.
4,Smooth,"Would've been nice to have BOTH discs, but what I have is nice. Perfect for those chillout nights when you don't feel like being bothered and just want to relax!"
5,Insights from the original language,"The author, a native Assyrian and speaker of Aramaic, shares insights gained from living in the Middle East and explains Aramaic idioms for the English speaker. A very interesting commentary."
5,GREAT item!,"Nice, large wrap very well made--especially for the price. I am going to order a couple more while I can still get them!"
4,Lovely,"this is a nice scarf and quite versatile. I bought it for my Halloween costume, but have used it as a wrap on a warm summer's evening as well. I like the satin borders."
1,unsatisfied,"I bought this navel ring awhile ago with clear crystals I thought it was cute and I liked how it is movable. Unfortunately only a couple days after wearing it one jewel fell out, and shortly after that another one fell out too. So I stopped wearing it altogether. I also bought another belly ring from the same company and that one began to tarnish quickly, So I don't think I will be taking any more chances ordering from this company any more."
1,Terrible Recording.,"This is an absolutely terrible recording. The singers' pronounciation of French is SO bad that even with the Piano Vocal score in my hand I could barely follow the opera. Whoever was the vocal coach did not know French. You will never follow the opera with the provided libretto. The tenor, Mok, in the title role gets really screechy at times and the score just overwhelms him. Basically this opera requires great voices and there are NONE present in this recording. You are better off getting the Paris recording of the opera with Samuel Ramey, June Anderson and Alain Vanzo. At least all of those singers are great voices who do justice to this score. I seriously do NOT recommend this recording to anyone who wants to enjoy this magnificent opera. The singers will grate on your ear as they screech and squall their way through the score."
5,Raw Classic Definite Soul,"This is a basic Gospel funky soul music album.Released in 1974 by the Staple family brilliantly fused Gospel with a background Soul moaning and repetitions, almost in every song. Nothing more can be said about this album except that if you are collecting all the classic Soul albums Like Isaak Hayes, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield and Barry White; this album is a definite must and a plus to the Collection.Highly recommended"
2,where did Capt. Marvel go?,"After watching Thor and Capt. America with my grandchildren, I asked them where was Capt. Marvel and they did not know who he was. How sad he is lost. The serial was a lot different that the comic books I remember, as little Billy was a crippled seller of newspapers on the street then who used Shazam to become Capt. Marvel. The story line itself was interesting since the 'Scorpion' was a cheezy villian. It was great fun to watch and brought back the days, when for a dime you could see a feature picture, a b picture, a cartoon, newsreel and a serical. Popcorn was a nickel. In Spiro, OK the theater was segregated, but I loved to sit in the balcony anyway. Glad those days are gone."
1,Re: Captain Marvel dvd,"This dvd, the Adventures of Captain Marvel, was ordered on Aug. 31, but has NOT yet been delivered to me. This is the first and only opportunity I've been afforded to contact you about this. Please cancel my order.-Trevor Von Eeden/thv2101@columbia.edu-"
5,The Adventures of Captain Marvel- shazam it,"SHAZAM! What Republic could have done with Superman is proven in ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel""! What grace and super style does To Tyler have in the role. You can see why Superman and DC feared the ""big red chesse"".I liked the actress Maria Sponza as the tempress. (God I need a life! She is hot!)"
5,True Super Hero Fan,"This serial collection is really nice. A must have for any super hero fan. The effects were nice, considering the time it was released. Nice story line."
5,Hilarious book-Another keeper for the cartoon lover!,"This is another cartoon I enjoy reading. I miss reading it in the daily news, as the small town we now live in has unreliable rural newspaper delivery. Carriers are lazy and inconsistent and the newspaper does nothing about it, so I had to cancel my subscription. I went searching for Sherman's Lagoon and found this as one of several. I chose this one because I enjoy compilations. I began reading this one last week and it is funny. I had to stifle my laughter on more than one occasion due to other people in the house are sleeping. If you enjoy a good laugh, and are a fan of cartoons, especially Sherman and friends, I highly recommend this one without hesitation. This is a cute book. This book is a mix of color and black and white comics from 1991 to 2001. All in all, this was a worthwhile purchase."
4,"Good Music, But Only 20 Minutes","Great mandolin playing, but I was shocked at the 20 minute runtime of this album. There are two albums in this set and I feel it would be better if they combined them both into one 40 minute CD. I agree with another reviewer that ""Mandolins Of Italy"" is a better CD with a runtime of 72 mintues. But at only $5, you may want to get them both and have 1 1/2 hours of music that way."
3,Typical Italian Mandolin,"If you're looking for an inexpensive CD of typical Italian mandolin music, this is just what you're looking for. However, I gave it three stars because it was too short and too predictable. If you're only buying one Italian mandolin CD, and if money isn't a major consideration, ""Mandolins from Italy"" is worth the extra bucks."
5,"a little chianti, my dear?","So charming ..... dream that you're dining under the full Napoli moon, or just sharing spaghetti with the one you love out back of Tony's Place."
4,free &clear shampoo,"Good product. I purchased this product because I thought I was having a reaction to scented shampoos and hair spray. However, my problem turned out to be acne with some swollen sweat glands. Therefore, hopefully the acne on my forhead will be cleared with the product epiduo that my Dermatologist prescribed for me."
1,"Created itchy scalp rash, especially around my neck.","I had a sever reaction to this shampoo. I ended up with a super itchy scalp rash. Especially around the back of my neck. I was only using it every other day but after about a month I had that reaction. I had purchased it because I get allergic reactions on my back from shampoo. I had been hoping that this one would do the trick, but whatever chemicals are in it are super harsh for me. It also smells terrible, and doesn't wash well. I havn't used it in a week and I'm still trying to get rid of this rash. I have never had scalp acne in my life until I tried this shampoo. I have very sensitive skin. I'm prone to skin reactions from most chemicals, and UV rays. I had been hoping that this shampoo would finally be the one that didn't cause an allergic reaction down my back though. I'm currently trying Neutrogena T/Sal because it is also fragrance free and hopefully will clear up this scalp issue."
2,"smells bad, dries out hair","I purchased this shampoo and conditioner and although my skin did calm down a little (I have acne problems on my face, chest, and back) my hair smelled horrible. Also, I noticed my hair began drying out, not like when I used regular shampoos."
2,Not Effective and Not Worth the Money,I bought this shampoo because I have a sensitive scalp and am prone to scalp acne. Right away I realized it wasn't going to work. It takes a lot of shampoo to clean the hair and it drys out the hair on top of it. The smell is bad. Now I know why they add fragrance to shampoo. Yuck! I would recommend skipping this product and find something else that actually works without requiring large amounts to clean the hair and won't dry out the hair.
3,Free and Clear..clear of side effects,I've been using the shampoo for nearly three weeks and have not had any type of reaction to my very reactive skin. since it is practically everything-free you have to use two or three applications to really get your hair clean.
4,Shampoo,I am now on my second bottle and am happy I tried it. There are few products out there for people with chemical and fragrance issues. This is a great product line.
2,Did not improve my dry skin,"Been trying out products to hopefully solve my dandruff, but this did not help. Actually got worse over the week and my hair became more dry/poofy/frizzy."
5,great for allergies/sensitive skin,"Hair feels clean, no rashes because of it. All in all, a good product. It will not foam up like other shampoos so don't expect that - but that's because those things can cause allergic reactions. This was recommended by my derm."
5,Great for Sensitive Skin,"But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of ""real shampoo"". It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions."
1,Didn't work out for me - dried out my hair,"With all the great reviews I was hoping for a similar experience, but the product made my hair very dry and brittle. Diluting the product did not help. My hair is colored so that may have been an explanation, however, it had a similar drying result on my young daughter's hair. I did not use it long enough to determine if it would have helped my skin."
3,Free & Clear Shampoo,This shampoo has helped my husband with allergies so much but it is so expensive. super fast shipping
4,I like it,It gets the job done by cleansing without irritation. I just can't give it five stars because it is so expensive.
5,They fought here?,"Coming into Gettysburg from the south you will find cavalry markers on the roadside, most will drive by eager to get to the ""good stuff"" on Cemetery Hill. Very few that stop know about or understand the nasty little action fought in the fields in front of them. On July third, the Union Cavalry face Longstreet's regulars under command of Evander Law. The Union Cavalry probed, pushed and finally attacked the AoNV's right flank in the ill-advised Farnsworth's Charge. This small book covers the almost forgotten battles in this area. Eric J. Wittenberg has given as a readable and informative book on this aspect of the Battle of Gettysburg. Coupled with ""Protecting the Flank: The Battles for Brinkerhoff' Ridge and East Cavalry Field"" this book gives one of the most detailed accounts of the Union Cavalry on July 2 - 3, 1863."
2,A bit flimsy,"This book is lacking in length and in depth of analysis. To say this book is 144 pages long is stretching things. The Epilogue ends on page 104; at least 20 pages (a conservative estimate, I think) before this are occupied by maps and/or photos. This leaves only about 85 pages of text. In reality, GETTYSBURG'S FORGOTTEN CAVALRY ACTIONS resembles a lengthy article more than it does a book. One stylistic criticism is the author's excessive use of long block quotes, which often disrupt his narrative."
5,always a hit!,"I can't say enough about Blue's Clues! Before we realized my son had a speech delay, he learned a lot of signs and communications through Blue's Clues and that's how we communicated with him."
3,New Blue brew to do you through; yahoo!,"I'm not really partial to this series, but the blobby blue pooch with the Bob-Saget's-younger-brother-resembling human host holds my kids' interest. It's interactive, meaning that there is lots of dead air, as Steve pauses for the kids' response. Is it educational? Too early to tell, though they ask for it often and seem to love the theme song. And that's a ""clue"" that the producers must be doing something right!"
2,See how far Katherine Dunn came to write Geek Love,"As a huge fan of Geek Love, I read both Truck and Attic, Dunn's earlier works. It's clear from reading Truck, the account of a boyish runaway girl, that Dunn came a long way in learning how to structure a narrative. The main character in Truck seems loosely based on Dunn's own childhood. The characters are compellingly physical-- they do things that real people do, like check their pits for smell, that people in books rarely do. They are polymorphously perverse. The plot is not terribly engaging, but you either sympathize with the characters or are disgusted by them; Dunn doesn't leave much room for simple apathy."
5,Come to the Table:Revisioning the Lord's Supper,This indepth study on the Lord's Supper has given me a deeper understanding and love for the covenant meal that Christ has provided for the church. Sitting at The Lord's Table will never be the same again after reading this book. Instead it will be all that Christ has desired it to be.
3,History of the indians of Connecticut,"Very dry for fun reading but great for reports, etc. When I say dry I mean it won't be fun to read just for fun. I used it for a report on the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and although it didn't have anything in partcular on them it had things they may have done or do. I recomend it."
1,Freemasons are not a cult,"I had to ask what could a woman know about Freemason's.1st. this is a men's only group,2. freemasonry is not, in any way, any type of religion or cult.I am just given to wonder how informed she really is."
1,F for sound,"Well this is a total F for sound. I have 3 dif 3 cd players, home, port, and car, and yes they are good ones, car is a Q45 with a Bose. I bought this CD because of the reviews I read here, what is everyone smoking? or is there not that good of stuff avail from Albert? I don't own any other CD's, but I do know about him from the SRV Sessions VHS I have had for a few years, and it sounds pretty good.This CD sounds like a taper recorded it, from that last row in the back or something. I have both SF CD's, the both sound the same.Can someone email me please and let me know what Albert King CD's. If any, have good clear sound.What I have that is great for Live shows is Cream Reunion DVD and CD, and Roger Watters in the Flesh DVD and CD, great sound."
5,Lovely baby's board book about winter and nature.,"Unlike many babies' book today, this book consists of real photographs of a variety of animals. These happen to be in a snow setting. With few words and beautiful pictures, a baby will get a good introduction to the world of winter nature, where the snowman will share his gifts of seeds and carrots. It is a board book, so it is safe to read and then hand to the baby. The pictures are taken from, without the longer story, the book by these authors, Stranger in the Woods. The birds and squirrels will likely look just like the ones the baby can see in his own backyard, and who doesn't love a beautiful deer? If you live with no snow, you get a good demonstration of what a snowman is. A delightful book all around!"
5,inimitable,"Absolutely ferocious! On ""Hell Eternal"" Setherial manages to produce a level of intensity that is basically unrivaled. There's just something very special about this album. I agree with the previous reviewer that, for the unprepared or uninitiated, the initial listen will simply be overwhelming. Good. That's how it should be."
4,Black Metal,"Leaving 5 for legendary CDs, this kicks ass. In The Nightside Eclipse with almost non stop blast beats, and Marduk sounding vocals. Its not the most original music out there, but theyre damn good at what they do. Its perfect aggresive black metal, the drumming, the blast beats, are awesome throughout and the last track is the best. The lyrics are flawless."
2,Looks home-made,"Disappointed with this product, it is big and shapeless. Not something to wear if you want a little pick-me-up. Will not be taking this to the hospital with me. Material is very soft though.''"
5,wife loves this,"I ordered this for my wife and it arrived today. She washed it straight away and it held up very nicely. She was impressed with how soft and roomy it is. So, I am ordering another."
5,Love it!,"This is the most comfortable thing I had while nursing. It really is more of a robe than a gown. I used it when nursing, it was very convenient and comfortable. It's not the most fashionable look, but it's not that bad either. Besides, that was the least of my worries. I had a difficult pregnancy, delivery, and nursing experience. I wanted something comfy and easy to allow my son to nurse. This did the trick. I still wear it on occasion, when it is cold. Would buy again."
2,Just a long Hospital gown,"I wish there had been better photos of this gown posted. The one we see is of a beautiful blonde sitting down in a rocker with a baby. What we need to see is a photo of a pregnant mother standing up wearing the gown. The only good thing I can say about this gown is that the fabric is soft. However, it is just a long, shapeless hospital gown that happens to tie in the front instead of in the back. I feel like a frumpy old lady when I put it on. I can't see myself wearing this nightgown during labor or after giving birth. It should be sold as a front tie muu muu. (I take that back, at least muu muus have more shape than this gown.) I regret not reading all the reviews before buying this item. According to one review if I want to return it, I can expect to return the item at a lo$$. Don't make the same mistake I made. Save your money."
2,Too Big!!!,"When I bought the product it did not have size options... so I thought it must be one size fits all. This gown is way too big for me and I weight 170 pounds and am 5.4"" in my 7th month of Pregnancy. It would fit two of me. Otherwise there is nothing wrong with the gown. The quality is good. But I will have to return the product."
3,"This is a robe, not a gown.","I was shopping for a maternity/nursing nightgown when I bought this. It's not a bad product, I'm not returning it or anything, but I do think the next customer might want to know that it is more of a robe than a gown. It's HUGE, has great wrap-around coverage, which I needed being 9 months pregnant and unable to fit into hardly any of my other maternity clothes anymore; but I was expecting more than a tie in the front to close it with. Not something I will wear with family/friends around before/after the birth, but comfy enough to lounge in with just me and baby."
5,Historical fiction well done,"As a librarian and avid reader of southern historical novels, I appreciated the research behind this novel, including a wonderful bibliography (unheard of in most fiction) at the end of the book for further reading. I would recommend the author's books to any reader interested in well-researched historical fiction. The interwoven vignettes are appropriately placed and lend an interesting sidebar to the story."
1,company NOT good to deal with,I ordered 3 items. This necklace came to me with a nasty kink and a ring that had a dent in it.I had to send it back paying for the shipping handling......so I paid for the initial shipping and handling as well as the shipping and handling to send it backThis company is ripping off consumers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Think I will order more!,"Sturdy yet delicate, high polish, have had many complements! . I ordered about 5 braclets from Sabrina Silver,,, Would absolutly order more ! Exceptional quality at very reasonable price.."
3,Milagros cotidianos...,"The book is good, thought I did read better books from Og Mandino (""La Universidad de la Vida"" or ""The University of Success"", etc.). The author gave too little of the the main personaje of the book. I whish I could get more details about The Orator...but still a very good book!"
5,Reason and Rhyme,"I have read your Divine Reason and Rhyme and find it balanced and hopeful. Perhaps we who live in such scientific, i.e.: logic/linear thinking have indeed lost rhyme. Of course Science has gone beyond itself, and is looping back to the spirit. In physics, the unexplainable is called appropriately enough, ""magic"". And my 10 year obsession with natural history and the origins of complex life has made me believe in spirit again after having Christianity drum it out of me."
3,Life on Mars - From Earth,"""Stowaway To Mars"" is one of John Wyndham's early science fiction efforts, written years before he got his big break with ""The Day of the Triffids"". This futuristic story is set in the far-off year 1981, when a ship called the Gloria Mundi carries the first people to Mars. A young woman has sneaked aboard the ship, and tells the crew of what to expect when they touch down on Mars.This novel can be compared to H.G. Wells' ""First Men in the Moon"". Both stories have been proved inaccurate by that bubble burster called Reality. But this doesn't matter. The imagination of such stories is what really counts. This book is the beginning of one man's distinguished career."
3,1930s science fiction,"Written by a young, pre-Triffids Wyndham under the name John Beynon, this is a less well developed effort that nonetheless shows his talent. The plot is standard, with an attractive female stowaway joining an all-male crew on a race to be the first nation to land on Mars, but it's graced with original details and intelligent epithets such as ""Mind is the control of brain by memory,"" and the fast-paced plot keeps you reading. The most interesting elements are the Martian landscape, the rusty berserk Martian robots, and the sad remains of the Martian people whose cities are like a series of empty rooms. When the story turns into a space romance, you understand why the stowaway had to be female. Wyndham always wrote with a sure hand, and that was no less true of this early effort than of his later, better novels."
2,Time has passed it by,"John Wyndam was at his best when he did not rely on technology, but looked at what would happen if comapratively small changes happened in an everyday setting. The story is not believable."
2,Best left for wyndham fans,"Wyndham has written much better stuff, but you can still feel the Wyndham charm on occassion. Probably best left for only the most die hard of Wyndham fans. The kindle edition, however, is poorly prepared. I own a physical copy of the book and the two can hardly be compared -- all formatting has essentially been lost in the kindle edition; medium and long dashes (--) have vanished as well, resulting in conversation with sentences that bleed together without boundaries."
2,Solutions Needed,"Although the content is there, there are no worked examples or a way to truly test your understanding. This may just be me but the text did not relate well to the analytical problems. However, if there is anyone who has come across a solutions book to accompany this text please let me know (rickwfsc@hotmail.com). I believe there was one for the 3rd addition but that is near impossible to obtain."
1,The book is out-dated!,"I found this book to be a very poor one, in terms of its timeliness. It touts itself as being ""practical, not theoretical."" But I found that this is certainly not the case. There are some better FEA books out there, but this is certainly a niche that is crying out for a definitive book."
1,A collection of papers at best,I am a graduate student of solid mechanics and I have read quite a few books on FEA. Of all the textbooks I have read-this is clearly the worst. The authors don't spend any time to make the material coherent and organized. They seem to have published this book just for the sake of establishing their names in the field. It is basically a collection of research papers on the subject. The worst part of the book is that the authors use excessive verbiage to describe extremely inportant concepts with little or no mathematics. This leaves the readers confused and disoriented. This book is not for those looking for an introductory text and is useless to even those experienced in the field. Avoid this book.
2,Another student prospective,"The comments left are interesting in that all the people teaching from it find it useful, and all the students find it frustrating...there is a trend here!I agree that the explanations are great in detail and the content practical, but at a graduate level with minimal support from the professor and no TA available, not having examples or solutions (to the odds or evens at the very least) is infuriating. After spending close to $100 for this text, I had to go out to buy another with some problems to make it through my course. Two stars for readability, will pile the other three onto the review for my other text.If a professor recommends this book for his course, my suggestion would be to go talk to some fellow students who have already taken the course to be sure you know what you are signing up for!"
5,Excellent book,I think this is one of the best books on FE. It is written from the point of view of an engineer and avoids unnecessary mathematics. The concepts are explained very clearly and there is a fair number of solved examples in each chapter.
2,Adequate at best,"I really tried to learn the finite element method by reading this book in great detail and is why I bought this book for an introduction Finite Element class. The organization and notation of symbols of the book was very odd, and therefore made it hard to read. Rather than talking about the theory first, the authors first state the equations, and then talk about ""remarks"" on the equations and underlying theory. The book contains very easy and introductory examples and problems, not practical examples that would help in the computer implementation of finite elements. For example, the book does not contain any examples on how to compute the stresses and strains from interconnected finite elements (which would help greatly when you want to write your own finite element program). Overall, a very confusing and brief presentation of the topics. I would not recommend this book."
2,Not an undergraduage text,"This book was used to 'introduce' us to finite element analysis. To say the least, the book is very hard to follow. For an undergraduate text book, I don't recommend it at all. The problems are very difficult and assume you have a lot of knowledge on other subjects. Also there are close to no examples. This would be a great book for graduate classes or those seriously interested in the theory, but not for the intro introductory class, unless you have a super great professor. Because of my bad experience with the book, and how I found it difficult to grasp, I give it only two stars."
2,Good theory but not really practical,"This book covers theories of finite element better than most other books in this subject, but it does not have many worked out examples. The problems have no answers!"
5,Do Not Listen To That J Spliff Guy,I agree bone is better but sandman kills all tha rest. This album had very good beats and everything about this album is good. Do not listen to that guy. This album is incredible and better then anything twista or do or die have put out. Twistas fat a$$ lost his skill and do or die just have annoying voices. 3 stars for this album is just outragous. Listen to it yourself and you will see.
5,"No Secrets, No Lies","This cd is one of those cd's where you can just let it play through and through. Another fine rapper comming from Minnesota. Such a tight cd, he mixes rappers like Twista and Bone Thugs, and makes it sound good!!!!"
3,OVER RATED,"Sandman has SOME tight lyrics on this LP, but he makes up for this with his delivery, which is fast and accurate. This is no 5 star cd though, the beats are sub-par and all the other reviewers have hyped this album beyond what it really deserves. Overall this is just above average, nothin special in my opinion. BTNH,Do or Die, and Twista are on a completely different level then this guy, the comparisons betweem Sandman and these rappers are strictly based on delivery, but delivery doesnt make up for weak lyrics and boring beats."
2,"A disappointing logbook, especially in its log design","I was very disappointed with the Runner's Training Diary, particularly with the ""log"" portion of the book. The design seemed dated and too confining. I never had enough room to write much, and it was visually unpleasant with its boxes of various grey shadings for the different categories. I did find the articles and charts generally useful, but to me, the ""log"" portion is the heart of any logbook, and I ended up ditching my Training Diary and bought The Ultimate Runner's Journal, which was much more flexible, has a much ""cleaner"" design, great articles, and included color pictures to boot!"
4,Liked the previous version better,"Getting ready to order my 12th copy of this log, so obviously I must like it. But I do have to say that I liked the format of the previous edition better. Guess I am just set in my ways!"
3,This is only a holder - no microphone is included,"Amazon has omitted the crucial word ""holder"" from the product name: ""Azden SMH-1 Shotgun Microphone with Shoe Mount"". The product description correctly identifies this as a holder for a shotgun microphone. Although this is a perfectly fine microphone holder, no microphone is included with this product."
4,Nice,Like it. Mounts nicely on the camera. Minimal noise and seems to be a great product for the price. I've only used it once so far but I would recommend this product. I did some research before I bought it and was worried that going cheap would mean low quality...seems good to me so far.
3,Not quite as good as the reviews say...but still a step up!,"I paired this with my AZDEN ECZ-990 shotgun mic for my HV20, and from the reviews I read it seemed like it would delete the annoying motor noises that the mic was picking up when attached by the included rubber mount. Although it helped to eliminate about 75% of the motor noise I was hearing, it is still clearly there. However, it's still very usable audio (especially with a little audio tweaking in post) and worlds better than the in-camera mic, which sounds like you're recording in a tunnel. During rush hour. With a rainstorm overhead...The good news is when I decide to upgrade my shotgun mic, this shock-mount will hold it in place quite easily. So it's more of an expandable upgrade, and one that I can use on a future camera as well. Worth the $35 I paid, and a bonus is that it comes with a nice sturdy box to hold it in! :)"
4,Really good item for the price,"This shock mount is great and will fit a variety of mics. I am a DSLR Video shooter and I needed a mount to go into the hot shoe. This one does just that for less than 1/2 the price of its closest competitors. Here's the one bummer about it - it DOES NOT SWIVEL OR PIVOT. I wish that I could raise, lower... Aim in general. Its construction assumes that I am focused right at the audio source of interest. If I am getting artistic with my shots, which I do, I want a bit more flexibility. But, again, for this price I'll deal with it and I might even buy another in the future.Oh, by the way, its built to last. Sturdy as can be."
5,Just right!,"I purchased this along with the Azden SMX-10 shotgun mic, when its in place the on-off switch is hidden by the body of the mic holder, really annoying! The holder needs to be shorter or the mic longer, I did not want to try another setup so I modified the rear of the holder placing a round piece of foam inside it that moved the mic 3/4"" further forward. Seems to work fine! I like this now as it is a lot more compact for me as I film out on the trails and don`t want large equipment. After my mod I would say it is perfect now. I will try to put up some photos of the mod."
4,Paper Dolls,"These paper dolls are so beautiful that I hesitate cutting them out to use as paper dolls. They are not the punch out type. They will have to be cut out by hand. I am planning on using an x-acto knife. The dresses are very elaborate and will be a tough job to cut out for an adult. I hope my granddaughter appreciates the effort.The paper is very heavy which is great for the dresses. I intend to put the ladies on heavy cardboard to make them more durable. These are too beautiful not to make them last as long as possible. The colors are vibrant. There is a nice variety of clothing options.Once I cut them out, I intend to secure them in page jackets to store them. I will reproduce the ""book"" by using the cover and back as the booklet jacket."
5,Better than an ordinary distionary,I had great fun checking through all the entries. I even caught myself at least ten times.I am keeping it and sending copies to my literary friends.Get it and enjoy!
2,E-Book Copy,The e-book copy is horrible. The text is so jarbled it is almost impossible to read. I do not recommend getting this book in e-book format.
5,Spectacular!!,"This CD is amazing. The wide varity of songs gives it a distinct flavor, and every member of the trio is an inseperable piece. Holly's voice is incredible. Aaron's piano is beutiful, and David's bass is amazing! I love this CD!!!!!!!"
4,I'd probably buy more Nick Junior tapes if it wasn't for..,"the huge volume of marketing material at the beginning. There's almost more preview material than actual show. That said, I do think Dora is a great role model for pre-schoolers. The tapes have opened up lots of conversation between my 2 year old and me on being brave, helping others and figuring things out. She loves to act out the 2 stories on the tape - especially the baby blue bird one."
5,A Good Role Model,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this. She is adopted and is hispanic. Dora is a great role model for her and is helping me teach her Spanish. The video teaches social, moral, and academic skills and is fun as well. The stories are sweet as Dora rescues baby animals."
5,"10/10, great book! Highly recommended","This book has information that hasn't even been heard by 99.99% of the world's doctors yet. If you want to learn about the effects of praseodymium, yttrium and many other super rare and strange elements and the effects of elements at curing hundreds of diseases that currently have no cure, read this book! You'll learn that chromium and magnesium can cure hypoglycemia, or that vanadium can cure diabetes. All sorts of amazing things are in this book!"
3,Sexy but tame fun - liked the multi angle but ultimately not enough,"If you've seen one of these Peach DVDs, you've seen them all. Hard to be too disappointed by watching sexy girls gyrate and strip naked, but this one left me wanting more.The girls are sexy, particulary gorgeous, busty Angel (one of my favs) and always sexy Asian Teanna Kai. There's also a busty brunette in a swimming pool that will get you going. But ultimately, this one ends up being a little disappointing because there is not enough ""pink"". We get some, but not the long, lingering close-up and spreads you get in the better videos. Angel gets much sexier in her Hot Body International videos than here.Did like the multi angle, as you are able to switch angles to see what you really want to see (and often focus in on the pink). Hey, for 5 bucks, its not a bad view and you'll probably get some ""fun"" out of it."
5,GREAT MOVIE,This arrived and quickly.A delightful followup movie to Love Comes Softly. A sweet story. I was impressed with the actress that portrayed grown up Missy (January Jones). That was a superb choice by the director and casting.
2,so-so,"I thought this movie was a little too predictable, but still has a good Christian message. Worth watching, but maybe not worth owning..."
2,Sad and Dissapointing!!,"Please!!! will somebody, please put out a REAL movie on these beloved series by a Canadian author!!!!I and my daughters all loved the books. When we found there was movies made, we rented them with anticipation, only to be very dissapointed!!!I really hope that someday, someone will put out a real movie with the real events of the stories written by Janette Oke!!!They are wonderful stories, and need to be made into beautiful movies.If I was Janette Oke I would be so very disappointed with these movies that don't come close to the books she wrote.It was just so dissapointing."
5,Love's Enduring Promise DVD,Service was EXCELLENT!!! Thanks so much for the quick shipping and the DVD was in Perfect condition!
3,Almost Got it RIght!,"Although I liked the story line, I was disappointed because I thought this was a ""family"" movie. I felt the scenes where the couple are kissing before marriage, etc., are not necessary to getting this director's point across on the film.Oh, well, is there anyone out there who will really produce a ""wholesome film?"""
1,Jones ruined what could have been a great movie!,Whoever said that they finally let Jones speak doesn't know anything about decent acting. Jones absolutely ruined every scene that she was in. She shows a complete lack of emotion and was completely unbelievable. She has never been able to act her way out of a wet paper bag and never will. I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing Love Comes Softly and was horribly disappointed after seeing this one. I will say that Logan Bartholomew and of course Katharine Heigl were amazing. It's too bad that the movie had to be ruined by Jones. Completely surprised to see that they cast Jones in this wholesome part after her basically topless picture showing up in a European magazine and on the internet.
5,Promises are only as good as what or who backs it.,"This movie was as good as ""Love Comes Softly"". It protrayed hardship but still promoted hope. I loved this movie and recommend it to all those who believe in wholesomeness and those who are romantics!"
5,Inspirational story about finding true love.,"The second of the ""Love Comes Softly"" videos. These stories should be seen by every child in America. Michael Landon Jr has continued where his father has left off and I know he is in heaven looking down on his son with such great pride and love. If you can't afford to buy them all (six so far) then I urge you to watch them on The Hallmark Channel and pick your favorite and add it to your video collection. I bought these for my grandchildren which I hope to have someday so they won't miss out on these special stories. I just hope they continue the videos."
5,Love story for all,I was flipping channels and stopped on the Hallmark channel and caught the middle of this movie. I had to order it and see how it all began. I watched the next 4 movies and all are great movies. I have been passing them to all my friends! These movies are good quality and good family values with Godly principles.
4,I enjoyed this movie,"Although it is very different from the book, I thought that the movie was very good. For me, the strongest character is Clark, although Missie is played quite well too."
2,Very dissapointing - pure religious dogma,"I really liked the first movie, and I thought I would enjoy a second one. No way - from the very beginning when I saw older Missy, I knew something was wrong. At first I thought it was a bad acting, but as movie progressed, I realized, that it was so heavily soaked with religious dogma, that it was unnatural - it has nothing in common with a first movie or real life. How can lively creative Missy become such a boring boneless person? Seems to me as a total miss. People behave and talk like marionettes.The only other movie, that was that unnatural I saw was Therese(2006.)"
4,Excellent Read,"I happened to catch this book for $1 and I gotta say I REALLY liked it. I don't know that I woulda been happy if I had paid the $5.99 that on the cover?! But I would recommend this for anything that enjoys a good supernatural beings book ( vampires, werewolves, fairies, etc... ). It handles it well.A Comedy?I don't think so... But, it is rather tongue-in-cheek at a few points, it'll make you chuckle.I guess the best light I could put it in is this...If this was a TV show?I would compare this to a mixture of ""The X-Files and Monk"".There's something to make you smile, but it ain't JUST a comedy...andThere's something to creep you out a little too...Good read!Wish I could meet the author, I would love to talk with someone that can think like the writer of this book obviously does..."
5,Man wolf!,"The Werewolf's Guide to Life: A Manual for the Newly BittenFantastic tale of a wolf bitten by a man, or werewolf in reverse if you like, it will have you laughing and crying! Again this is another book that is hard to find at a reasonable price in a reasonable state... But there is a rumor going around that there is going to be a movie made about this book, which I hope is true and would love to see, and who knows maybe then they would republish this book!!"
4,Everything happens for a reason.,"Although I did not find this novel as funny as the Sir Apropos trilogy, it did have it's moments (Not many things have been able to surpass those books). Peter David did a terrific job in giving this type of a story substance; the story wasn't just about a wolf being bitten by a werewolf but a clever way of executing how animals must think humans behave. Also, everything that occured happened for good reason: Darlene's purse, bat breaking, and not to mention a cavity filled mouth. This was worth the read and I would definitely recommend to friend."
3,werewolf becomes man every full moon,"""Howling Mad"" has a wonderful premise, but falls short of its potential....about a werewolf let loose in New York City who turns into a man once a month. Some chuckles, but a disappointment after his sidesplitter ""Knight Life""...."
3,Keychain,This keychain is great to put on your keys or backpack and is very sturdy. However the flag looked different from the picture as it has a yellowish tint. Still a great gift for any Dutch fanatic!
5,Life at sea in the seventeenth century,"If you have harbor a fantasy of life aboard a pioneer vessel, read this book. The lauguage is rich in the time and the author is honest. Your are guided through a stint of sea duty in the days of tall ships. Read and feel the meaning of standing watch and surviving the trials of ship board living. You will come to appreciate the rigors of command and the helplessness of being commanded. Remember the Captain is lord and hope you draw a fair one. Let yourself go and enjoy a fine read, a classic in time. Five stars..."
5,Two Years Before The mast,"Richard Henry Dana catured the spirit of humans and the majesty of the sea. The rounding of icy waters off South America to watching swimming dolphins was a descriptive marvel to us who have seen it all on PBS. Mr. Dana's observations of the South Sea natives hired in their special boats to 'surf' cargo ashore in the waves of mid-California foretold of a phenomenon that was utterly impossible to predict. From going to the (then) vapid student halls of Harvard Univ. to swaying 100 ft over the raging waves of the ocean, this book might be good as required reading for those students entertaining a different course in life."
1,Not a juvenile,"I was horribly disappointed. I expected the original version with decent adult illustrations, not an abridged copy for 7 year olds. I returned it."
1,Bad POD,"This was a POD book that was full of asci characters, it was not formatted, not even chapter page breaks. UGH. Do NOT buy this. The book itself is a masterpiece. So, I repurchased it by a traditional publisher."
3,"Not Moby Dick, but just as boring","This story of an educated man doing the work of a common seaman in the 1830's takes it's place with Melville's tome. It seems to go on forever and ever describing the finest details of sailing and shipping furs. Just how much does the reader want to know about this especially when we get described repreatedly which sail and which wind, and how long they sat motionless in the water, and on and on. Somehow I felt compelled to keep reading, in hopes of finding some action or excitement. A few pirates would help, especially if they had peglegs or obnoxious parrots. Oh well, it's a different style than Robert Louis Stevenson or even ""A Perfect Storm."""
1,Possibly the worst book,"don't listen to any of these people, this book is the boringest book you'll ever read. unless you are really interested in ship duties and sailing i highly DO NOT recommend this book!!!!!"
4,From paperback to hardcover,This book was purchased as a gift for someone whose favorite read years earlier was 'Two Years before the Mast.' They were thrilled with the copy.
5,excellent,This video came out just in time for school. My son started pre-school and this video made him excited about starting school.
5,Wonderful skits for typical kids and kids with special needs.,"Wonderful piece for pre-schoolers and kids with autism. Teaches social skills and friendship skills with clear language. Whenever my son gets frightened, he now does what little Bill did to get rid of stage fright."
4,New ideas from a great new author,Mr. Isaac has written a tight and fascinating fantasy that leaves you wondering... what next? I truly enjoyed this book and look forward to the next installment.
3,Promising but falls short,"This memoir dives deep into the author's thoughts, weaving past and present through letters and flashbacks along the way. What is lacking, after the initial chapters, is adequate narrative of actual events. After reading this book, I know what the author feels but not who she is. The switch between past and present gets confusing, and the introspection wears thin toward the middle of the book. I wish Michelle had described more vividly some of the incidents she brushes over, the black eye in Dallas, the bite on the arm. The book has heart but lacks soul."
3,First Was MUCH Better...,"I didn't quite remember this movie being quite so cheesy... I've been trying to find the first one on DVD since it is 100% better than this... But, as far as 80's horror goes, this movie gets a B in my book!"
2,Disappointing tragedy...,"Being a fan of Scott and his writings, I expected much more from this book than it was able to offer. Although the actual writing of the book is excellent, conveying wonderfully the flavor and character of the times as well as the vanity of the monarchs and suitors, the plot ends abruptly with a tragic ending. Aside from altogether disliking tragedies, I found this ending a surprising disappointment because the book gave very little indication of the horrific climax which was to come. After finishing the last page, I almost felt as though I had finished reading two separate books - a romance and a tragedy"
2,Great content... horrible tape,"This is a neat TV christmas special from the 1990s. The problem is that (I guess for music licensing reasons) bad music is dubbed over many scenes.In other words, you see Barbara Eden on you screen but you can barely hear her because there is generic christmas music dubbed over her audio (I assume to cover up some background music.)Plus the dubbed tunes are just awful. They sound like old cell phone ring tones."
5,Correction to Previous review,"I will agree that this is an amazing CD, but something that wasn't mentioned properly is that this is the first Sabres project, their ground breaking explosion release with the ultra talented Andrew Weatherall at the helm. Basically, anything Weatherall touches is gold and you should just buy it, 'nuff said. Their later stuff gets more ""experimental"". Take that as you will."
1,Bad,I heard a dub reggae song I liked by the Sabres of Paradise. I assumed they did dub reggae. So I bought this CD. It's not dub reggae. It's (garbage).
5,Before you go to Vegas,"This book is for those who love life and want to learn how to enjoy it. It does not teach you how to make money, but it sure tells you how to spend it. This book is a must read for those who wish to go to Las Vegas or Atlantic City. I have read it number of times over the years it has been in my possession. This book is in the same class as 'Oil' by Jonathan Black. I wish they make a movie based on this book with Danny DeVito in the lead role."
1,Unbelievably bad,"Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working.Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution."
1,Very poor quality. Never consider it for your business.,"Few clicks during the first installation, blue screen..... It killed my networks (Ethernet & Wireless) configuration. Very poor quality. Never consider it for your business."
2,Not the best of compilations.,"Priced right, but you'd be better off spending a little extra to get one of his other ""greatest hits"" CDs. This one has many of his best songs, but they are in medley-like form (something which you wouldn't know from the play list). All of the movie songs, for example, are contained in one track. This makes it difficult to access individual songs. Also, be aware that this is a live recording, and there is a lot of talking before some of the songs."
4,One Track Missing from Amazon's List,"This applies to CD Number 12 351.Amazon's list of tracks overlooks #5, the 50s Medley (Butterfly, Are You Sincere, I Like Your Kind of Love, Lonely Street, In the Summertime."
1,Greatest Hits???,"These are not the original versions of his hits. I've heard some artists that still sound good as time progresses, but this album was a complete disappointment. Having many of Andy's previous albums, I suggest one look for earlier work. Live recordings also seldom rival the original versions. I wish I had not purchased this one!"
5,I loved the book,"This is a good book but if you are expecting it to be written in the style of Laura Ingalls Wilder's series, you have a surprise coming. Rose Wilder Lane is a good writer, but in an extremely different style from that of her mother..."
3,Let The Hurricanr Roar,this story is really intresthing. it is just like on the banks of plum creek. i dont understand why they traveled west. But molly is the only 1 watching the baby while david travel back west to find a job i dont now why she and the baby didnt go with him.
4,"nice tone, relatively low hiss","This product is compact and light enough to take pretty much anywhere, and the battery seems to last for hours. I find the tone pleasing, somewhat ""warmer"" than cheap transistor amps. The high end is faily clear, and the lows are pretty good for a unit this size. There is some hiss and background noise, but it is almost inaudible unless you put your ear next to the speaker.The controls include inputs for CD (twin RCA jacks) and a mic (I am not familiar with this connector), as well as a headphones jack. The construction seems solid.All in all, this amp delivers what it promises, with no drawbacks that I have noticed after using it for 2 months."
3,Good but little bit out of focus,"I passed my last exam for the MCSE+I using several books, don't under estimated this exam, using this book was not enough and little bit out of focus. In the practice exam, at the end of the book the questions was too much focussed on client configuration and none on Scenario situation which will be asked around 10 questions in the exam. This book will help you pass the exam but you need a good study guide ."
5,"Old friend revisited, rediscovered","Bill Staines is one heckuva song writer and singer. His cassettes were de rigeur on our western road trips in the '70's and '80's. He has continued a remarkable career. Tom Paxton has long been my gold standard of song writing quality and versatility, but I am now rethinking. And, this is a Staines winner."
1,does not stand the test of time,"about 20 years ago all i would use is tek toothbrushes. i am someone that likes a firm toothbrush, my teeth have never been damaged by a firm toothbrush. tek used to make a quality firm toothbrush that lasted a long time. those days are gone! i was happy to find out that tek toothbrushes still existed but disappointed when my toothbrush arrived. now it is about the quality of what you would find at your local $1 store. firm is no longer firm and it's not long lasting."
3,Not thrilled - it's really a Medium (not Firm),"Vendor provided great shipping, but the product doesn't do what I wanted.Bristles are still too flimsy - not actually firm enough to thoughly clean.The bristles are too tall and that's the problem. Also I didn't like the large square head of the brush.It's just an old standard toothbrush.. nothing special. I wanted one that really was firm. This is medium.You get what you pay for - price is 1/3 that of the other firm toothbrushes.I don't use it though, so it's not worth anything."
3,A good attempt to capture OO language features,"If you have found that after coding in C++, java, smalltalk or any other OO language that there are certain concepts that have remained ambiguous this books makes a good attempt to make clear distinctions between them. The information is there however it requires a good deal of work to extract it. It would benefit from further layering of concepts, improved organization and tighter cross referencing. As it stands it is a little too dense."
3,Good but not an easy reading,"It is quite a good book from the second time you read it. You will get a lot of more information whenever you read it next time. However, the sentences are too difficult to read. So this is especially the very textbook for the course, since if it is not, you will never go to the 2nd page after you open it. I would never had read it through if it had not been required for my course."
3,Leans on history instead of present implementation,"The reader should not expect a example heavy treatment of C++, but rather an almost exhausting history of programming languages and emphasis on C++ theory. Upon review it is an adequate text, although not immediately accessible."
5,A Valuable Resource,"I recall reading that when Messaien was captured by the Germans during World War II, one of the few musical references he had in the POW camp was a score to Bach's BRANDENBURG CONCERTOS. The POW camp, of course, was where Messaien wrote his masterpiece QUARTET FOR THE END OF TIME. Owning this score won't guarantee the production of further masterpieces, but it is a valuable source of information. This edition also includes the ORCHESTRAL SUITES, as well as a preface that details the discrepancies between various editions of these works."
5,Amazon's Best Documentaries,"This is a well done, heart wrenching documentary about one of the most traumatic days our country has ever experienced. It demonstrates the amazing strength and courage of the men & women who worked so hard to save lives and give hope to our country and all of the families who've lost their loved ones. Through their relentless determination to recover people and clear this disastrous area, they discovered one piece of steel in the shape of a cross. Since it stood strong and alone amidst the debris, it seemed to have been symbolic of strength and hope to our working heroes and our country.It is definitely worth the purchase as a remembrance of the courage and strength of all the men & women who sacrificed their lives and the dedicated workers who gave their all to assist and give hope to the survivors and our entire nation. To me, it's a reenforcement of what a wonderfully strong country we live in, and how thankful we should feel."
3,Terrible audio quality,"While the picture quality of Alien 2 is easily 4 star , the audio quality of this Blu Ray release is 1 star at best . Upon first viewing I noticed periodic popping and crackling as well as an annoyingly loud hissing that came and went throughout the movie . It was so bad I thought that my sound system might be having problems . I brought the disc to a friends house for a screening and heard the same audio issues at the same points in the film . It's definitely a problem with the disc itself . It is a shame because the picture quality is so good , a little more money on the audio and this would've been one of my favorite Blu Rays of the year . 3 stars is generous in my opinion considering the incredibly boring extras included . A fun B movie but a flawed Blu Ray ."
4,"Hauntingly beautiful, reminiscent of Julee Cruise","While some of the lyrics do repeat a bit much, overall this is pretty neat stuff. I play it with Julee Cruise's Voices of Love."
2,Amateurish,"This collection is a real disappointment. Stories are similar and sophomoric. The book is also very poorly edited. In several stories the authors seem to be unable to keep track of which character is which. I am a strong supporter of gay literature. C'mon, guys, we can do a lot better than this! Fortunately there are many gay story collections out there that are far better."
5,Finally something metal has needed,"ANARCHISTS OF GOOD TASTE is an amazing album by DOD FASHION DISCO from indie label Spitfire. DOG FASHION DISCO is a cross between System of a Down and Mr. Bungle with their own unique sound. On first listen it is easy to classify them as a Patton like sound, but to those who put them in that category, I reccomend taking another listen. DFD offers everything you could ever want in a cd, especially with their circus like vocals and thier powerful music. Serj from System of a Down even appears on a track. DOG FASHION DISCO should be in everyones collection. They are a new voice in a dying metal scene. DFD is just the type of band to revive it."
4,Mr. Bungle Jr.,"Mike Patton is God and Dog Fashion Disco are his subjects. Let's get that out of the way, so we can review this material. It is good, and it is very interesting. To totally disregard this album simply because it is heavily influenced by a genius is to dismiss a quality album. In other words, get over it. Would you rather another boy band or a band who imitated a talentless, Limp Biscuit band? This is not a radio friendly band, they are creative and passionate, and they have put together a very good album."
4,Better Than Most,"It's very easy to dismiss DFD as just another band waving the bungle influence tag - and even on a listen, they are admittedly very much 'heavy Mr. Bungle', but I think they have really hit the nail on the hammer with this album, they have created something very important in the heavy rock (even nu-metal) scene, and that's this - a very interesting, heavy record. It's loaded with genre shifts, catchy riffs, keyboard couter-melodies (reminds me on what would be ""heavy Doors""), loads of time signature changes (something I love), vocals switching between strong, controlled and melodic to an immense roar - all very Patton, although sometimes too Patton, but it doesn't bother as much as most nu-metal Patton wannabes; dark but colourful lyrics: and the whole thing mounts up to an amazing atmosphere that has you hooked, there's not a dud song on the album."
1,bad,"This band is horrible! And even worse live. They have a lot of growing up to do.Boring, boring, boring."
2,Dog Fashion Disco Volante,This album only serves it's purpose as something to listen to while waiting another 4 years for a new Mr. Bungle album.
1,If you think this is good You are wrong!!!!,"I sow these guys live with SOAD. I would have to say they SUCKED!!!! SOAD was great though. I normal like alot of stuff that's dif, but this!!!! This is not good in anyway!!! They got booed off stage at the SOAD show. I just downloaded one song just to show my friend just how crappy they are and will 2nd me. From what i can rember about them I think they had like one good song out of the whole set. How did they ever get to open for SOAD I will never know. I wouldn't let these guys open the door for my dog. Don't buy this or anything else they put out. if you are looking for something def then try MSI, Bad Acid Trip, etc, etc, just don't even try this!!!!"
4,Decent,"This book was helpful for me in some ways. There were a few sections that dealt with materials I did not even think about, but was very glad I was confronted with in a book rather than in my practice. The downside of this book is that it uses language that it created and so if you read it out of order, you will get lost. Short, quick read!"
1,jiveness,"This album is not funky nor is it soulful. Lame. Unhip. It is a travesty. They had so much to work with and put together so little. If you like 70s elevator music, you'll love this. I listen to all jazz and funk...this album is rancid. I love the Beatles, this is a disgrace to both r&b and the band. They should have all been white for all I could hear. Maybe they were looking for more coke money...they sound spun(and deaf.) All I can say is shame. They get one star for the cover. Talk about an over rated hackfest. HACKFEST. HACKFEST. TERRIBLE HACKING HERE."
4,Liverpool-Memphis Soul styled concept!!,"This release reflects the creative minded artist roster that STAX created during it's heyday. The concept was right and the music is quite inspiring on this collection,theirs not much that can be said that has'nt already about this 1970 classic,however I would like to add that although Booker T Jones was and still is one of the grooviest Hammond B-3 players around he is also a very underrated Blues Pianist as he has displayed throught his career. Anyone interested in more STAX should check out oneline(or visit as I have) the STAX museum in Memphis,check out their website."
3,Booker T & The MGs Mclemore Avenue,"As a hard-core Beatle freak I'll try anything once, especially when done by B T & t MGs. Hey, I'm a sucker for Green Onions.Mclemore Ave. is a selection of Abbey Road songs, out of order from The Beatles' crack at it, and much closer to muzak. On my first trip through it I was at least amused at the liberties taken on a given theme while occasionally getting momentarily lost. On this list of such singable songs I missed the singin'! But a replay or three later I wondered why I'd not expected exactly what I'd heard the first time. It's interesting to a pop/rock fan, at least this one, and perhaps just the ticket for Mr. Guder as he talks business while sitting in traffic in his Beemer. It's jaaazzzz."
3,Southern soul meets Abbey Road,"The Beatles made a huge impact on the music world and a great many performers have felt compelled to offer their own take on the Fab Four's music. Several, such as Joe Cocker, even made it big overnight by interpreting the Beatles in their own unique way. Unfortunately this album doesn't quite measure up. It's certainly well performed. No one can doubt that the MG's were one of the tightest outfits in the history of popular music. But I'm not sure the songs on Abbey Road lend much to the MG style. Most of what's here is played masterfully on the organ, as one would expect from Booker T. Jones. But I get the feeling that Steve Cropper and Al Jackson may have just been along for the ride. As a fan of both bands I found this enjoyable to listen to but the novelty wears thin before its over. If you're a fan of the MG's you may find it quirky. If you're a Beatles fan you probably won't be impressed. McLemore Avenue is OK at a bargain price."
3,They gamely press on to The End.........at the beginning.,"Certainly a mixed bag. The guys might have done better doing an album of Rolling Stones material if they were compelled to find a musical concept.Natcherly, they do better on the harder, more funky numbers like I Want You and Come Together. Other cuts just sound clumsy, as if the band isn't fully committed to the material. Even the incomparable Al Jackson seems a bit uncomfortable. But they gamely press on to the end, leaving out Paul's surprise Her Majesty tag. Three stars for an interesting idea, but there's lots of a MG's music to own before you get around to this one.DJ Rix"
3,A total curiosity,"This is an oddball, clearly a product of the times, and constantly walking the fine line between totally inspired and totally elevator. Their rendition of ""Something"" approaches a level of George Bensonish inpiration. The large instrumental suite near the end of the album (track 4) sometimes catches fire, but often, you get the impression that BT&MGs are only doing this because they're (1) short on material or (2) because they can. The latter is reason, in and of itself, to check it out."
3,I like it...,It's a little like HAIR comes to Woodstock. I was surprised I liked it. Definitely Beatle influenced. But it WAS a good album!
4,Get It for the Art,"Yes, the story by Jodorowsky, instead of being one of his better surreal works, is merely an attempt to connect together a bunch of black and white drawings by Moebius that are unconnected except in theme, and, as a result, it would have been better if the publishers instead used the pages devoted to the text to print more Moebius artwork, but if you are a fan of Moebius, this is a nice collection of some great artwork printed in large a size on good quality paper. It doesn't get 5 stars because of the wasted pages."
3,Not-quite-bizarre-enough 'Erotic' Effort from Jean Giraud,"Anyone familiar with the work of Moebius (Jean Giraud) will recall the bizarre dream logic of his classic 1970's serials 'Arzach' and 'The Airtight Garage of Jerry Cornelius'. The same idea is applied to sex in 'Angel Claw' and the result is an abortion! 'Angel Claw' is a jumble of alternately sexy or morbid images 'connected' by a story written by Alexandro Jodorowsky, Moebius' collaborator on the disappointing 'Incal' series.I can't give Moebius less than 3 stars, but this was another disappointment."
2,Uninspiring,"I came across some cookbooks my mother had that were distributed by processed food manufacturers in the early 70s ... that's what this book reminds me of. The recipes are sized for one or two, which is nice, but there are very few dishes that would appeal to someone who is trying to eat healthy. I suppose someone with more time and imagination than I could figure out how to modify the recipes to incorporate fresh ingredients."
5,Coolkinf for 1 or 2,Good cookbook with a variety of recipes. It arrived in good condition and on time. i was glad to be able to track it.
3,Easy,"As in most cookbooks, there are some items you make that are really good and some that go in the trash. However, I found some that were easy to make and I'm sure I will make them again."
1,No GPS Lock!!,"I have had this unit for about 18 months but have used it only 6-8 times - never in foul weather. It worked fine at first - with TOPO downloaded maps onto the MMC card and a Navionics card for marine use. Always locked on fairly quickly. Displayed maps beautifully. Now, after not using it for about 4 months (the batteries removed for safe storage) the unit will not lock onto satellites regardless of how long it's left on or despite performing soft and hard resets. The built-in Lowrance software on it is actually newer than what's on the latest Lowrance software update page - which makes no sense at all. Lowrance's minimum repair rate is $149.95 plus shipping since the 1 year warrenty has expired!! I might as well buy a new GPS - a non-Lowrance unit this time! The price and features are very attractive. But beware, I think it's a very inferior product in the long run."
1,Buggy software and no tech support,"Please see my full review under ""iFINDER H2O C PLUS"". This product should be avoided due to serious software bugs which cause reboots when certain key sequences are used. Making the problem worse yet is the total lack of Lowrance tech support. After 3 phone calls totaling 2 1/2 hours and 2 e-mails over a period of two weeks they have not responded. You'll especially like the fact that you can't leave a message for tech support until you've waited on hold for one hour....go figure.Very dissipointing, I'm taking it back and exchanging it for another (non-Lowrance) unit."
1,Wasting your money if you buy H2Oc,If you search the internet you will find many complaints about this product. Just stops connecting with satellites and the Customer Support response is send it in with $180 and we will replace it. Some have sent theirs back multiple times in warranty. Unfortunately mine was just out of warranty when it died. Will never own Lowrance products again.
1,Lost Waypoints,"I purchased this product 2 years ago. It is used to mark waypoints on my favorite lake. I purchased the Fishing Hot Spots chip for it and proceded to mark favorite fishing places. It worked fine until this year. Now it will not lock on a satellite so all these waypoints that are on it are worthless. I have not contacted Lowrance about the problem, but after reading the other reviews there is no need. I thought about buying an antenna for it but hate to spend the extra money if it still doesn't work. Until Lowrance gets there act togeather they are history for me."
1,no gps lock !!,"I have used this gps about 7 or 8 times over 2 years, and now I get no gps lock. Lowrance says send $150.00, or wait until a new version comes out. A friend also bought one of these units after seeing mine, and now his won't get a gps lock. I don't know what is causing this problem, but I do know that I will never purchase another Lowrance product."
5,Lowrance iFinder H2O,Have used this only a couple of time and it works very well in the areas I have tried. Would buy this product again.
2,Incluide Maps of Latin America??,Hello I live in Costa Rica. I need the GPS. I would like these incluide de Map of Costa Rica and Latin American??
2,Don't bother,"There are very few recipes in this book compared to others in this category. I also bought ""Secrets of the Spas: Pamper and Vitalize Yourself at Home (Life's Little Luxuries)"" and it had many more recipes for only $1 more."
2,Cheap for a reason,"I purchased this CD wanting something inexpensive to practice the bass solos with and because it was available locally. Big mistake. The Bass soloist is horrid--extremely wide vibrato that obscures the melismatic passsages. None of the soloists are exceptional, the soprano being the best. Wish I had listened to the samples here first."
2,"Bland, bland, bland...",Trust the MUSICIAN'S comments below...he knows what he's talking about. This is just a lackluster and unmusical performance that is not worth your time. Find another recording. Almost ANY other recording would be preferable!
4,Non-stop action and incredible tension.,"I will admit, the characters were not very well defined, but we don't need to know this, because we know what's going to happen to them. Anybody who has read the book or knows the story of the fishermen know that the storm is going to kick in and they will eventually perish. If this was not a true story, I might be asking for a little more character development, but you see the movie for the terrifying storm sequence, which never gives up in the last hour. The waves keep coming and get worse until you feel like you're in the storm with George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. Watching this in the theater, the tension during the last hour was making me sweat. I was transfixed and mesmerized, and above all, horrified."
2,I might have liked it,"...if I had been able to stay awake for the whole thing. I watched this movie while it was raining and I was too sick to do much else, and I tried to watch it twice, but the first time I fell asleep, and the second time I got bored and read a book instead. The visual special effects were well done, but the screenplay was so poorly written, I don't think there was much that could have saved this movie. Once the written work is badly botched, it's hard to say if the directing or acting or cinematography was poor, but it's probably a safe bet. On the other hand, you might like Marky Mark in this unbelievably miscast role. I for one am not too upset about missing the last few minutes of the film."
2,"Ocean, 1 - Man, zero",I liked the score and I don't think there is anything wrong with this movie--except that they made it. Everybody's brave; everybody's stoic; everybody dies. If you wanna be depressed--really depressed--this is for you.
2,not so perfect,"it turn out the perfect storm isnt so perfect. This movie doesnt have a whole lot of character build up so its kinda hard to care about the characters. george cloony gives a dissapointing performance at best. Although this movie does go through alot of bad spots, the movie picks up towards the late middle and and finishing scenes of the movie, plus some good special effects. my advice though i would only rent this video."
2,They missed the boat on this one.....Hollow Storm!,"This is my opionion: The movie should be named ""Hollow Storm"". Overall this movie is empty! Character development is horrible, that acting is ""woody"" and empty. They could have done this true story justice with a better script. Lame sub-plots throughout. Very weak overall. Just poor quality as far as a movie. Redemption (not)!!: The image quality is amazing. The computer effects and ocean are truly incredible and a breakthrough in cgi, although you have to be bored out of your mind for about an hour and a half before you get to see them. It was just too bad. The hype made it sound great, but in reality....VERY LAME. Don't buy this movie...It is only worth a rental , if that. You'll never watch it again. The potential was there with a great cast and all, but they ""missed the boat"" on this one."
2,no full screen version in mini collector set,"If you bought the mini-collector set to get both the wide-screen and full-screen version, don't count on it. The set I received included only the wide-screen. Amazon has agreed to take it back, but either the collection I received was a fluke, or the advertisement is just flat wrong."
2,Don't listen to the hype,"This movie was a total disapointment. It is a sad story, but the film does a poor job of getting us to care about the characters. The dialouge is poor, and overall the story is pretty weak. Save this one for a rental."
2,drown this film-,"Snore! I was excited to see this film for the special effects and expected to put up with the usual cliches- but my god! The entire first hour is dedicated to developing the fact that the fishermen have wives and children at home who love and miss them. The actual effects are great, all 20 minutes of them, but skip the rest of the movie."
3,The Documentary Was More Exciting,"Before I saw this movie I watched the documentary on the history channel, which was way more intriguing. It was interesting to hear about the rescue of the other fishing boats and what the rescue divers went through during the storm. The movie portrays the crew of the Andrea Gale as a group of common heros. Against better judgement, they decide to go through the most dangerous part of an incredible storm instead of waiting it out or trying an alternate route. The boat rocks, some men fall out, windows break, the boat capsizes, they drown. Not very exciting, and the storm sequences should have been a little more exhilirating in my opinion. I gave it 3 stars because it was interesting, and accurate as far as the storyline goes, but as far as excitement goes....it's definately lacking."
3,The Perfect Storm was NOT the perfect movie,"The ""Perfect Storm"" is not the perfect movie. Directed by the notable Wolfgang Petersen and based on the actual story of the worst storm in history. In 1991 the crew of the Andrea Gail, a Glouster Mass. longline swordfishing boat, headed deeper into the Atlantic Ocean than usual for a fishing expedition. Upon her return, the Andrea Gail heads right into the ""Perfect Storm"", a massive divergance of three separate weather systems, that prevents her safe return home. The best special effects were shown in the TV trailer. The special effects recreating stormy skies, violent seas and the giant waves were impressive. The story loses reality when one realizes, as I (a recreational boater) did, that no knowledgable Captain would have ever ventured out into this impending severe weather scenario. All in all, I found it entertaining but I did not like the ending. The perfect storm deserves viewing, but you should probably rent it."
1,No Plot and BAD Acting,"This movie had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no plot. There is no character development. This movie is riddled with some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Don't waste your money. Visual effects are okay, but do not make up for lack of plot and lack of acting. There is no story. A storm comes along and kills people. That's it. A complete waste of film."
2,"I enjoy this movie, but this review will be based on the amazon streaming.","Issue #1 cost about $3 to $4 for 2 day rental, which is fine cause this movie is available on netflix. But therevis no caption, which is absurd my dad who has hearing issue and better to understand the film because English is a second language to him.Issue #2 living now in a very diverse culture it is incredible how slowly the development to have at least captions but also have more common language audio selection such as Spanish or French. This is also an issue with netflix, though there is more progress there than in amazon by at least have caption on most of their movies and tv shows and Spanish audio for 5 films out of their many selection. About 77.43 DVDs and blu rays have caption and second language audio, why can't digital streaming."
4,Perfect Storm on Prime,"It is a good movie and the quality was good. But as usual, it froze up a couple times and had to be restarted. It seems to always happen with Amazon Prime. Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Vudu freeze sometimes but not every time. I don't think I have watched an Amazon movie that I did not have this problem. But other than that slight inconvenience that I have come to expect from Prime, it was a good watch."
4,"Compelling action, subtle performances","Watched this just ahead of Hurricane Sandy - with my wife who wasn't familiar with these kinds of monster storms. Very exciting, with strong subtle portrayals of the working fisherman. Recommended"
4,Sinking of a long haul swordfish boat in a Hurricane,"This is my fault. I receeived an excellent DVD copy of this movie. Everything is good on that. This purchase seems fine as well, but I didn't intend to purchase it. It's an HD-DVD format that my PC wont play. I may have donated to a local library."
3,Amazing f/x saves film from being another disaster pic,"Despite the inane dialogue and the stock characterizations and the maudlin ending and the hokeyness of portraying conjectures and hypotheses as actual events and the fact that this is really just another disaster movie, I found myself completely hooked into the story by the special effects. When that final frenetic hour came around, I was crouched into my seat with my fists clenched. As I think back on the film, yeah, there were some wildly unlikely events on the Andrea Gail as her shipmates struggled to survive but damn, that was one hell of a storm."
3,Not too bad,"I had no desire to see this movie when it was in the theaters, but someone gave me the DVD so I figured I would watch it. I must admit to getting pretty caught up in the storm, despite the hokiness (especially that phony shark!) and sometimes stilted dialogue in the beginning. I felt like I had been there before, having seen so many shows about Gloucester and about the Andrea Gail.The storm scenes were amazing as were the scenes of the Coast Guard pilots trying to rescue the people from the yacht. (Even though they were added, I am sure, for dramatic impact).I think the actors did a great job of conveying the sense of urgency and the teamwork needed on a ship like this.The life of these fishermen (and women) certainly is one of danger and hard work. Living conditions are pretty bad. It amazed me when I saw at the end of the movie that over 10,000 of these fisherman have died in the last 400 years. Sad."
1,Deserves ZERO stars for trashing a great book,"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I know that you're not supposed to expect a movie to be as good as the book its based on, but THIS is an absolute travesty that cheapens the memory of the real people who died. Has Hollywood no shame? There are so many factual inacuracies and utter implausibilities that they can't all be listed here. And the cheesy background music destroys whatever excitment the well done visual effects might generate. The only positive thing that can be said is at least George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg LOOK right for their perspective parts. But they are given lines of dialog so unbelievably hokey and cliched that you almost feel sorry for them as actors.Bottom line is if you loved the book, stay far FAR away from this totally disrespectful farce."
2,The Not-So-Perfect Storm Movie,"The ""A Perfect Storm Movie"" is about the sad story of poor fishermen who cannot seem to catch enough fish to get by. When their captian finds a large group of fish, the crew sets off on a dangerous journey. While they are returning home, a massive storm forms. They stupidly decide to continue home even though it means battling huge waves.While watching this movie, I found myself bored out of my mind. The character-developing section is unnessisarily long. You will begin to grow restless waiting for the wave scenes. Then as wave after wave tossel the ship around, you will wonder why you purchased this movie. Why buy this movie when you can just wait for a hurricane to be televised on the news. As the movie draws to an end, one question enters your mind, 'Why did I waste all that time watching this?'"
1,Not the perfect movie.....,"This was among the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The plot lacks any point, and, aside from the special effects, has nothing remotely interesting about it. It is basically about a group of the stupidest fishermen in the whole eastern seaboard who realize they don't have any money, so, decide to go on a fishing expedition even though they get 1000's of hints that sailing their course would be suicide. But being truly idiotic, they go right to the place where the 4 largest hurricanes on record are about to collide in search of more fish. (Even the fish they seek would be more clever than these stooges and the twits who directed this film.) The only part of this movie that's truly sad is the fact that it takes itself perfectly seriously."
5,I Love this movie,"I don't understand the negative reviews, sure there's some weaknesses in this film but I consider it one of my top ten, although I would have preferred little more in depth look at Gloucester. Strangely this film makes me want to go out in the mid atlantic during a storm and see what I would do.. Highly Recommended. Ignore all bad reviews. ;)"
3,"SOME BREATH-TAKING SHOTS, BUT OVERALL A WATERY BORE","Imagine making a movie with not a hint of suspense or tension, just a macabre storm at sea in which ultimately everyone dies. The end.Movies like this are probably made simply to showcase the possibilities of CGI, a bit like Mummy 2. At least they didn't just sacrifice the black guy, like they do in most of these types of movies. And there's no dog to root for either.I liked the fact that they have a plump woman who is the object of one man's sexual desire. The people (even the big stars) looked real. They were not just Hollywood ugly (e.g., beautiful people wearing glasses) or Hollywood grimy (e.g., leading man with an eyepatch). The characters looked pretty battered.So there is a good sense of reality, but the story goes only one way, and all the CGI trickery in the world can't help the film from its storm of tedium."
1,Once upon a time...,"... movies (the best as well as the worst) were made by people (actors & actresses, writers and directors), and used special effects to enhance the show. Nowadays, 'Special Effects' are the show, the story is written by accountants (whose creativity in accounting should not be extended out of this domain, since their concern is not about moviegoers, but shareholders), and, if actors are not yet out of work, it's only because their sex life can be used in tabloids to promote the release of the movie. But, of course, for those who think McDo is the most enjoyable culinary experience, they should not be disappointed."
1,World's worst story and movie . . . .,"Why would anyone make a movie or write a story of a bunch of guys who think to themselves 'this storm is really bad and we'll probably die if we go and try and catch fish in this storm but heck, let's try anyway' . . . then they all die . . . end of movie."
5,A PERFECT MOVIE!,A really great film. Have watched several times. Loved it!!! Would order from this seller again and again. Everything in exact shape as stated by seller.
3,Almost a keeper,"The perfect storm up to a point could be believable however, the last 1/2 hour was all hollywood fiction. Clooney did a great job !"
4,the perfect review,"The perfect stormThis book is a very detailed book about fishermen and how they work. This story line in this book is in no real order so it is a little hard to follow. This book tells you how it feels like on the ocean and how good you feel when you catch a lot of fish or how bad you feel when you hardly catch any. This book also tells you the experience of drowning and how helpless you feel floating all alone in the ocean. This book may confuse readers under 10, but I think this book is a really good book to learn how fishermen do their job, this book also tells you how a storm works and how boats may be able to survive it, and how it feels like to jump out of a helicopter and save people from their drowning doom. I advise you to read it"
4,"question the accuracy, but a very entertaining film","Question the accuracy, but a very entertaining film. Relatively family friendly, entertaining and somewhat realistic. Would recommend to friends and family."
5,A Nice Classic,We watched this video during Sandy storm!!! :) It is a very nice classic. Easy to watch and exciting. Sad to hear that it is a true story though :(
3,Ok movie.,"If there were nothing else on I'd watch it again. This is just an average movie about a STORM based on true events. There is no real character development, no action, adventure or humor. Its a great STORM, just not a great movie."
2,Halloween Storm.,"As a Rockport resident I got a laugh at how warped the picture was.The corny dialogue,the ""Crows Nest ""sitting on the pier.The saving grace of the movie was the storm.The characters were not believable and more than likey the end ,when the ship sank would not have been so pretty."
2,boring,"This movie was too long. I thought many scenes were not needed. I like long movies if they keep my attention but every scene after the other didn't seem much different. The waves were cool to look at but I'll never understand the stupidity of the sailors in this movie. I don't know the real story but they must've been insane if they really tried to get back in the midst of 3 storms. I also ust don't really understand fishermen at all. I live in Alaska and I hear of fishermen who die in the Bearing Sea all the time and I just can't understand why anyone would want to be a fisherman, especially up here where it's so dangerous, when there are so many other jobs out there that offer a world of oportunity. That was the main reason why i didn't like this movie. It was also very predictable all throughout. Rent it first. Unless you're a die hard fisherman yourself and you love these kind of movies."
2,hmmm not bad,"it's a good story, not as i expected it would be! it's a cross bread between jaws and twister (without the shark)mark whalburg was horrid as always. clooney was alright. but overall not a great movie. rent it, but not worth a buy!"
4,Like Backdraft?,"The Perfect Storm plot follows very closely to the movie Backdraft, except its hero's are not firefighters, but tuna(?) fisherman. If you enjoyed Backdraft as I did, you'll certainly won't regret watching this film.After seeing the Perfect Storm I know know there is really no such thing as fresh fish (it's all frozen)."
4,"95% excictment, 5% boringment.","Ths film it's very good, great FX, great perfomances, excpet by the actress who plays Bobby's wife, great story, lots of excictment, but i wish that someday a DTS sound version should berealsed."
3,Give Em A Break!,"I think many of the other reviewers were unduly harsh in their ratings. This was a mildly entertaining movie, and not at all a bad way to spend a night at home. I did give it 3 stars because I doubt I'll watch it again(plan to give it away)... maybe this is a better one to just rent, enjoy, and return."
1,Too bad I can't go below 1 star...,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is very boring & the ""special effects"" are to laugh at. 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. I would have rather played with a cardboard box! First off, singers can not act (mark walburg). Secondly, George Clooney is a bad actor to begin with, so..., Thirdly, The story plot stunk. Why would I want to sit & watch a movie about fishermen for 2 hours? I shut it off after 40 minutes, I could have cared less how it turned out. Whoever game this movie more than 1 star, is crazy!"
1,Smells worse than a cargo hold of rotting fish.,"To quote Kevin Kline in ""Fish Called Wanda"", ""DISAPPOINTED!"". Hollywood took one of the most gripping novels of recent history and turned it into a loose collection of bad music videos. It was a joke, a hackneyed, no punch line told by your least favorite uncle, pull my finger kind of joke. The ""Making of..."" video was far more interesting. Watch that instead. Oh yeah...""Beware the Flemish Cap"". too. BWAHAHAHA The Perfect BLEECHH!"
1,Tsunami origami,"I am sorry guys, I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but unfortunately, I can't with this one. I watched this... and even though ""Three Kings"" gave me a new respect for Mark and George, I have to say, this is a stinker. A big... bomb, that could have absolutely been better. If you crave water...See Abyss!! (The 1 star is for the water)"
3,MUCH better than expected....,"Marky Mark in a decent movie??? Yeah, this one is not too bad, albeit not my usual cup of tea. The movie is about some fishermen who get stuck out in the middle of the Atlantic during a Hurricaine. How they get stuck and what happens to them is very well laid out, the cinematography is very good."
3,Not so perfect storm,Love it or hate it The Perfect Storm is about the tragic loss of life aboard a Swordfish boat. The DVD is a good memorial to the men who lost there lives that day
3,Exciting action + mediocre story = Disaster Movie.,"Not having read Mr. Junger's book I cannot tell you how well this movie adaptation pays tribute to the men who perished in one of the most violent storms in history. As a stand alone movie it is certainly exciting, but the drama is about as dimensional as that found in other disaster thrillers such as The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno, and Earthquake. I recommend it to fans of those style films, those interested in the human toll of the storm should stick with documentaries or Mr. Junger's book, which I have heard is excellent."
3,The perfect mediocrity...,"This is just an Okay movie. It has good special effects, but by no means do they deserve the kudos given by others here. Several of the scenes strain credulity and look like the computer-generated images that they are.The story itself is a story of bravery and grit, and the scenes in the town and on the boat, before the storm hits, ring true. I found the acting to be good as well.But ultimately this movie is your typical two-and-a-half star average summer movie, except it's not exactly fun to sit through.Bottom line: Unless you love somewhat depressing movies about really bad weather (bummer, man), I'd rent, not buy."
5,"The perfect, er, EVERYTHING...","I loved this movie. I cry every time I see it. Although the music is a lot like Titanic, it IS sea-faring music and whenever I hear it, I know it's from The Perfect Storm. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg deliver a heartfelt performance in this tragic story. I suggest you rent this or buy this movie and soundtrack!!!"
4,Considering weather these days,"The story is well-done, with fine SFX. It recalls a tragic incident which might have been averted had reason won out over greed. Clooney and supporting cast are good; you won't fall asleep in this one!"
3,Nice Movie,Not a fan of profanity but this movie didn't have too much. Clooney and Mark were great but the rest were ok.
3,"Good, but overlong","The Perfect Storm could've been perfect, if they didn't add so many details. Even though it's based on a true story, the whole thing is kind of boring. While watching, I was wondering why anyone (even someone who spends most of their life out at sea), would risk their life going through a huge storm (worse than an earthquake), just to get so many fish back to their hometown. The whole idea to me is just stupid. But anyway, the special effects and sound were great, so were some dramatic love scenes, so this is an OK DVD."
3,SPECIAL EFFECTS SAVE THIS DISASTER EPIC,"The special effects in ""The Perfect Storm"" are the star in this film, other than that the plot is corny (even though based on a true story), the acting is fair, but the movie is very far from perfect.The movie is slow, and and runs on empty except for the storm scenes.Karen Allen from ""Indiana Jones"" fame is wasted as passenger on a boat that is saved from the Coast Guard, I think her only words lines in the movie were ""dangerous"" and ""they heard us, they're coming"".The movie does have a surprise ending that unlike the Hollywood movies today, however the movie is only worth the special effects, and seeing Clooney and Diane Lane (able to cry on cue).Overall Clooney, Lane and Wahlberg give fair performances for a rather weak script and premise.Like I said if you want to see good special effects with water, then rent it, otherwise skip it."
1,The Movie Was the worst peice of ... I have ever seen,"Was a waiste of my 3 bucks at Blockbuster. Just a sad, sad movie. The movie starts off REAL REAL slow and you wait for the action to happen like you see in the commercials and then when the 3 seconds of actiion comes its the end of the movie. The Special effects is just some guy throwing buckets of water into the boat. After i saw this movie i was so ... at it. I advise NO ONE to watch this Movie has no point. There is no Plot i swear to god i can summerise the whole movie right now. People get on a boat to get fish then they die. There i just saved you 3 or 20 bucks. THANK ME"
1,Don't waste your time,"Unbelievable character development, lousy special effects, poorly told story. So much hype. So much potential, so little development."
1,Are you kidding me?,"There could not have been more strategically placed tear jerkers in a FICTIONAL movie. So much of this fabricated story is offensive to the deaths of these men. How do we know if any of the male bonding occured, or the shark? Maybe the crew killed the ""Skippa"" because he brought them all the way out there. And as for the special effects, come on, seriously...big waves at night???"
1,Idiotic,"Frightening--that I spent good money to see this. Really bad! Dialog consisted entirely of stupid macho posturing; no story line at all. Comic ""dramatic"" situations. Confusing or entirely missing character motivation--why on earth did any of these people do any of the things they did? The ending, however, was quite rewarding; too bad the writers weren't on board."
1,Just not possible,"I didn't see this film until it was released on DVD. Thinking I would be in for a treat, I sat down for an evenings film fun. Unfortunately, this movie happens to be one of the worst I have seen this year. The reasons I hate this film:1. The story (what story) doesn't seem to be there. Looks like an add on, so that the film makers can show off some SFX.2. The SFX are not as good as they should be. Now you have a film with no story and limited SFX.3. The worst part of the whole film has to be that the stuff the men aboard survive is just so unbelievable, its like watching a comic book translation of what should have been a good film."
1,Too bad it doesn't go to 0 stars,"I can't stress enough how BAD this movie was. Worst movie ever. The waves were laughable. The movie was too long. The script was awful, which meant the acting was terrible. I felt sorry for the people around me that were crying and that were afraid of the waves. Horrible. It's sad really, that this flim was critticaly acclaimed..."
3,book was better,"Not a bad hollywood version of the book, but misses the nuance of Junger's original fine book"
2,Not Very Good...,"After all the hype-the action scenes in the film advertisements etc., I expected an exciting adventure. What I got instead was about an hour and a half of predictable dialogue (most of which I could barely understand because of the poor quality of sound in the movie). In the last thirty minutes I kept waiting for something to happen that would prove this to be a ""thriller"",""nailbiter"", or an ""edge of your seat"" adventure. Soon I found myself yawning and looking at my watch wondering when the thing would be over.I can't say the acting was poor, it was fair. Certainly the special effects were good, but it just never seemed to grab me in one way or another and certainly didn't live up to the huge hype it had been given. All in all there are better ways to fill two hours of your time."
4,Is the perfect storm perfect?,"The perfect storm has its high entertaining points and tons of mind bending waves, except the story is basically plain: They go out and get caught in a storm. Of couse the movie is entertainig if you would like to watch a storm for two hours. But with all the DVD features included this one may be a holiday top pick!"
1,1 star is way to many!,It started out slow and it was hard to follow. And at first when the boat starts to sink it is kinda exciting but it take 2 hours for the boat to sink and it just keeps repeating. If you want to to have more fun just go look out the window!
5,Absolutely fabulous,"Hi everybody! My name is Don and I want to share with you all my feelings about the movie ""the Perfect Storm"". My goodness what a thriller. From the opening scene you start to like the characters. The main character, George Clooney, is especially likable. And what a hunk to boot. Once they get out into the sea the adventures really begin. My goodness, I could not believe storms got so big. At the end of the movie I was crying. I'm going to be in line when it comes out in rental and I'm going to watch it for a full weekend. Go see it!"
3,Hollywood Fluff!,"I know that it is rare to have a good adaptation of a good book, but it has been know to happen. Look at Last of the Mohicans, Shawshank Redemption, and others to name a few. But, this was the worst adaptation I have ever seen. The book was not only exciting, but also very detailed and it made you feel the storm. I'm not one of those people who never like a movie because I read the book; I actually saw the movie first this time. I thought this movie would be great, it had talented actors and a big time action director, but what it lacked was character development. If viewers don't care enough about the characters, then who cares if they live or die. The movie made a lot of money due to it's state of the art special effects, but to me, they were neither state of the art or special. The storm looked computer generated and nothing exciting. It was a waste of my money and time to watch this movie. The trite ending also didn't help; the voice over at the end could of make people puke!"
5,The Perfect Storm,"This movie was ""perfect"".The DVD arrived in ""perfect"" order.I am quite satisfied with all the products I haveordered over the years.Amazon is the ""perfect"" source.Thank you, Jack C Gatton"
1,DO NOT WATCH!!!! Disgusting.It is a waste of money.,DO NOT WATCH!!!! Disgusting.It is a waste of money.
1,fish 1 rednecks 0,"the book, and the associated ""hungry ocean"" by the sistership's captain, are both excellent. the movie exists to portray computer simulated waves, and this was successful. as a story, however, it's truly a disaster- the gutted and beheaded swordfish carcasses were more likeable than any of the redneck bar maggots that we were supposed to empathise with. too bad they didn't show a few swordfish munching up the drowning fishermen- that would have tied things together nicely."
1,Unplaced review,"Whatever I had to say about this movie was probably rated ""R"" by the people at Amazon. Pls. if you are at all even just a tad critical with regards to acting / story and special effects don't go see this movie. The movie can only be compared with...(the likes of)... independence day & godzilla since they are made by the same individual (Wolfgang Peterson)."
3,Entertaining,"I gave this film three stars for intense action and the special effects. It was very exciting, and the storm sequences kept me at the edge of my seat. But for those of you who are interested in the true story of the Andrea Gail, this isn't it.Reading the words, ""based on a true story"", makes you think there were survivors who described the actual events that took place. It was a real letdown to discover that all perished and the accounts were the figment of a Hollywood screenwriter's imagination. Although this film is for thrill seekers, not historians, it is entertaining, and entertainment is the reason movies are made."
2,2 STARS FOR THE STORMS !,THE MOVIE WAS GOING GOOD UNTIL THE END THE ENDING IS JUST HORRIBLE.DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.I CAN'T SEE HOW THIS MOVIE IS A BESTSELLER.
2,Storming Out,"I'll sum it up fast and easy - not a good movie! As a matter of fact, I'm a little tired of hearing how great this movie was. I felt the performances were forced, and at times downright cornball as they come (for example, witness the scene between John C. Reily and his son in his truck). Horrible, horrible, horrible. What's good about this movie? Stunning visual effects. That's about the only reason to watch this film."
1,TV Movie without the commercials,"Stupid but handsome wooden stars. Factually absurd for a movie that purports to be based on reality. Special effects were no big deal for all the hype, look downright phony most of the time. TV Movie dialog and writing. Strictly for the low-IQ set."
4,Caomments on THE PERFECT STORM,From an actual happening. Every year some Gloucester fishermen are lost to Atlantic storms. The movie lets you get to know some of the men on the ill-fated vessel. The storm effects are horrific.
2,Where's James Cameron?,"I have to say that I was disappointed after watching this film. This film has good animation and computer effects but it lacks so much the emotions. You do not get emotionally attached to any of the characters at all. And although the waves and scenes were very convincing but it did not thrill me because I was not sympathizing with the actors.I wish James Cameron directed this film, maybe it would have been much better!The DVD extras are satisfying and the Deluxe Collector Set are nice but I wish it was for a better film!"
4,Enjoyable,"Good cinematics, great sound track and nice blend of special effects. Although this movie states that it was based on a true story the story line as to why the crew perished may be a little on the dramatic side. Never the less I would say this was an all around good film."
2,The Perfect Storm,Stay away this movie is a joke and shows Hollywoods lack of creativity and good actors!
2,Great scenes - not enough story,"I saw the advertisements, could not wait to see the film. Only to be very disappointed with this story portion. When the movie was over it was as if to much of the story details, that make you a part of the movie, were missing for you to feel satisfied."
2,"Has its moments, but....","Luckily, given the outstanding quality of today's technology available for viewing films, almost ANY movie is watchable. ""The Perfect Storm"" was no exception.However, as easy as George Clooney is on the eyes, Mark Wahlberg, (forever emblazoned in my memory as that pathetic moron in ""Boogie Nights"") is equally as irritating. The plot was initially promising, but once that vessel took to the high seas and encountered the ""Storm"" it became repetitive and monotonous.In addition, the ending held no realism for me at all. As a matter of fact, it was one of times you fully expect the movie to shift to an entirely different scene in order to achieve some sort of closure. Instead you are left with that ""Is that the END?"" feeling.Graphics were great of course, and very realistic. And as fond as I am of action films, the ""Storm"" just had too darn much of it - to the point of being irritating."
2,disappointing,"after reading a bit about this story and seeing wahlberg and clooney work well together in three kings (a far superior movie) i was extremely excited about this. but this was terribly boring, with anticlimatic action sequences, contrived dialogue, and awful acting. whoever wrote the big screen adaption of the book could make good money writing for days of a our lives."
3,The Perfect Storm Review,"A thrill ride from the very start, The Perfect Storm takes you into a world that many find unfamiliar. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg star in this film as fisherman caught in the 1991 storm that has been called the greatest storm in recorded history. Their adequate performances thankfully don't detract from the overall theme and feel of the movie. Still allowing you to experience the characters overall urgency. If you liked both Titanic and Twister, then this is an amalgamation of both.The disk is loaded with features that allow you to see the different and amazing techniques to make the film so realistic. The visual trickery involved is amazing and probably worth a second viewing.Overall I wouldn't rush out and buy this DVD, the acting is sometimes a little wooden and awkward. But if you happen to receive it accidentally from a DVD club director's selection, I wouldn't return."
4,"Good effects, bad story line.","I've heard the story of this movie on several television shows before I saw it. I admit the movie was boring (the story line), but I liked it. The special effects were about the best part. I really feel for those poor men. How frightening to be out in the middle of the ocean with no possibility of help coming, knowing the worst thing that could happen is going to happen. Like the title of my summary says, Good effects, bad story-line."
3,Utterly Depressing....,"I have never seen such a depressing movie in my life (well at least they didn't ""HollyWood-ize"" the facts I guess). Living in MA, and having worked in Gloucester, maybe I knew too much about the story and it made watching the movie somewhat unbearable. The movie was well acted (except for Wahlberg, but his role was limited). I especially liked the work done by John Reilly, I think he might be the most underrated actor working today (Boogie Nights ""Reed""). They kept a lot of little esoteric details in the movie, that will undoubtedly make folks from New England smile. And yes, the story is for the most part completely factual. But, like most Boston area movies, I am completely insulted by thier sad attempts at creating true Massachusetts accents (the only one who sounded right was Wahlberg, but he is from Boston anyhow!). I dunno, watch it if you have the time to waste and don't mind feeling like total crap afterward."
4,close to Das Boot,"If you liked Das Boot you'll like this movie too. Das Boot by Wolfgang Peterson (who also directed this movie) is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. This one is not so great, but it definitely deserves 4 stars."
4,"Great special effects, sad story.","A dramatic and compelling story traces the ill fated voyage of the Andrea Gail, a swordboat from Glocester, racing with the unpredictable weather of an New England Autumn.Well told with compelling special effects and dynamic sound, the story is moving, the acting is fine, but the pace of the storytelling and the depth of detail does not compare well with the outstanding book.I won't buy the DVD, but the movie is certainly worth the time."
3,Not so perfect!,"I found this movie very depressing. Come to think of it, the making of it was great. But the story was very poorly written. However, it's a good one to rent and watch at home. Not really worth to spend time and money at theaters."
2,boring,"second movie i have called boring from this summer, after MI 2. while i know that the subplot with the second boat was in the book and it actually happened, but the time could have been better spent in developing the characters of the andrea gail better. the Wave was excellent, which is why i give it two stars, as was the attempt at the accents. but we needed to feel more for the characters on the boat."
5,Excellent DVD,"This is an excellent DVD, one I have purchased for my 12-year-old as a Christmas present. The DVD has three different commentary tracks - for people like me, who love this stuff, this is the most important thing. There is also a really fascinating movie about the making of the movie - I am usually oblivious to special effects for their own sake but I thought these were really interesting.As for the film itself it is more interesting than I had expected. There is something fascinating about the story that goes behind its simple plot. Something I can't articulate. I think it's a great movie."
3,Lacking Perfection,"In this adapted true story, special effects are amazing especially during the time at sea. However by the end of the movie you will feel water logged. Story lines were not fully developed, or even fizzled to the side. I would suggest renting this movie because it is great as a one-time view but not good enough to purchase."
3,just ok,"this movie can be made much better. it is based on a true story that a group of fisherman met ""the perfect storm"" and how they go through it. The special effect for the storm and tidal waves are nice but the story a bit slow and boring."
3,Not worth the upgrade to HD-DVD,"I am not gong to review the movie as everyone has seen it and I only bought it for the HD-DVD aspect.Like a lot of older re-released high def movies, the studio did not take extra steps on the re-release to take advantage of the greater capability of HD-DVD. The result is that neither the visuals nor the sound knock your socks off like the do in a full-on HD-DVD release. If you have the DVD version, no need to upgrade. If you don't and want the movie, you might as well get the HD release, but buy it used for less than $15 (delivered)...or just get a used DVD for $5."
1,A disappointment,"This movie was so hyped that I came to it with the expectation of a really fine work of art. Unfortunately, that's not what I got. As tragic as this movie was, I didn't feel sorry for these fishermen. They knew the horrible combined storm that was brewing and went out in it anyway. They risked their lives for a load of swordfish? Talk about people who need to set their priorities straight!"
1,The Good and The Bad,"The Good:Not much is good here. Two words sums it up just right, ""Special Effects."" Thats all for the good.The Bad:Why is it that no directer can successfully turn a book into a movie. Yes, I realize you cant include everything from the book, but come on. This movie is a absolute mockery of an adaption and an insult to my intelligence. Everything that was good from the book was left out or changed in the movie. Just another example of Hollywood dumbing down the script so that people can be entertained. The irony is that the story the book tells is far more interesting and exiting then this discrace of a movie. Ok, if you want make a movie about this subject, fine, but dont call it ""The Perfect Storm,"" and dont adapt the movie from a excellent book. Call it something else, call it ""The Big Storm"" or ""The Perfect Disaster"" because that is what this movie is, a disaster."
1,The Perfect Bore,"Is there some rule in Hollywood that states that all ocean disaster epics have to have sophmoric scripts? They would have been better off calling this film ""Titantic II"" because of the simply awful ""Cameronesque"" dialog. The special effects aren't that impressive either, because after a while the endless scenes of massive waves become so commonplace it gets boring looking at them. I can't believe that the man who directed the great ""Das Boot"" twenty years ago has managed to sink so low. Read the book instead and avoid turning your mind into jello by watching this perfectly awful excuse for a movie."
1,disappointing,"To all of the boaters out there be prepared to be insulted. For anyone who has been out in bad seas, this movie will make you laugh. What ever happened to life preservers? How about the plot - WEAK! If you want to see some of the best special effects for waves, than watch it but you will not be able to watch it twice. Oh yeah, they go out in the worst time of the year for weather and never once listen to the weather. Than they drive right into because the fish will spoil. DUH! The real people who were in this situation are turning in their graves."
2,Booorrrriiinng!!,"This simply is not a good film. There have been TV programs about this particular storm which I found much more engaging. I have to admit that the special effects where impressive but hollywood has to learn that there is more to movie making than this. By about half way through I realised that I was just never going to care about the characters or the storm, I just wanted the film to be over."
1,"The Film Maker of ""Das Boot"" Also Made THIS?!?","This is one of the worst films hubby and I have seen in awhile. We were all primed for greatness too knowing that Wolfgang Petersen, who had made our all time favorite high seas adventure, at a fraction of the cost, was at the helm. To say this is not ""Das Boot"" is like saying George Clooney is not Tom Cruise. The soundtrack was grating beyond belief, oozing sentimentality and mawkishness. The writing was corny and, boy, they laid on the maudlin element with the women folk with a trowel. Then there are the actors. I know Mark Wahlberg can do better but I think I have given up on ever seeing George Clooney act anything but handsome on the big screen. Fortunately, I got this at my library for free so I didn't waste any money on it. I have the book and I hear it is terrific so I think I will simply wait until this disaster passes from my mind and then read it."
1,Unbelievable,Unbelievably bad! The only redeeming part of this movie was the comedy of Clooney out on the fallen mast being whipped about by the hurricane winds. Truly hilarious! Did anyone think to [at least] consult a meterologist and physicist for this? At least it would have almost convinced me that this happened.
2,Y A W N !,I could not suspend reality even for a second here. The whole thing is way too contrived. It made me happy my DVD player has a big fast forward button.
2,The perfect nap,I don't know if I was just tired that day or what but this movie did not keep my interest at all. I saw it on home video and I walked away and came back toward the end when the people actually went out toward the sea. I'm sorry but this movie wasn't that good. Maybe you can see this movie in the afternoon when your bored or you don't have anything else better to do. Like take a nap.
1,Perfectly Awful,"If you thought tv fishing shows were boring, just wait until you see this film. The first part of the film is a pathetic attempt at character development. Mr. Nice guy loves his wife and Son despite separation. Mr. Ugly guy finally finds love. Mr. 2nd Lead has a girlfriend much too nice for a trawlerman and she is setting up home for them. None of this made me care one bit whether any of them lived or died. The second part contains the worst special effects I've ever seen. Just in case you still don't care about the boat crew, they throw in some dumb helicopter pilots; I cared about them even less. Worst movie ever. I just hope some fool buys this from me on an auction site."
2,I Felt Cheated,"While technically I thought the movie was well done, and the special effects were quite impressive, I came away from the film feeling that it had somehow insulted the memory of the crew of that doomed long liner. When you get to the end movie, and realise that in reality there were no survivors, you are forced to acknowledge that everything which is purported to have happened on the boat, before and during the storm, is nothing but a figment of someone's imagination. The words and actions, depicted as being those of the crew, are nothing but subtefuge and imagery created just for dramatic effect. Were one of my relatives to have been lost on that unhappy boat, I would be incensed by the liberties this movie takes."
3,Creative license,"Great special effects, so-so acting, but the real problem with this movie is its creative license. The Andrea Gail was lost at sea, and nobody (including the book's author and the film's director) really know what happened in the ""middle of the monster"". The ship could have been overwhelmed by the first 50 foot wave to hit it. The action sequences are breathtaking, sure, but why base it on the true Gloucester story if there are no factual accounts of the events at sea with the Andrea Gail (except for the fact that these morons actually headed into the storm)?At least other true stories at sea like Titanic and the more recent U-571 had corroborating facts to tell the story. Perfect Storm is Wolf Petersen's attempt at fiction/non-fiction."
3,What a country!,"Some amazing special effects, tense action sequences. Good acting marred by occasional screenplay hokeyness, and some bummers at the end. George should've known better when even the gal from the Abyss was telling him to scrap the mission. Mark Wahlburg is a hunk. I'm not sure why Karen Allen took such a small role."
2,A Film About Stupid People,A well made movie with very good special effects. Ultimately however it is a film about stupid people who die at the end but you don't care because they're stupid.
2,The Perfect Disapointment,"Don't be fooled by the big wave in the trailer for this movie. That's the best part, and you have to wait two hours to see it. And while you wait, you have to sit and listen to horrific dialogue, watch a bunch of sailors curse and fight each other, and see a bunch of New Englanders sit around a TV and watch hurricane coverage on the local news. This movie is boring! There's nothing new about the concept, just another cliched film about man versus nature. Trust me, it's not worth the effort to stay awake throught this movie."
3,A Perfect Movie,"I thought it was a good movie, althought I find it impossible to believe they crew would continue to travel through a storm with such force. I'd recommend viewing if you haven't seen it."
3,the perfect storm,this is movie about a crew who catch fish and then sale them. one night they go out to fish when a storm comes . the storm kills everyone on the ship . George Clooney has a terrible performance in this movie he does a bad job someone else would have done a better job. this has great storm secnes.
1,George Clooney es muy macho!,"I'm just glad I didnt actually pay full price to see this in the theatres because it flat out sucked. George Clooney is too cool for school in this film. His character is irritating and filled with testosterone, but then again...arent all his characters? Marky Mark is o.k., but too much of a woos in this movie. The other guys did this bonding thing midway in the movie which was so pathetic it made me choke on my popcorn. All in all a horrendous movie. Instead of buying or renting this movie. Go out and go for a nice walk and treat yourself to some ice cream."
1,No real Content and Casting wrong,"Do the words, Predictable, and overacting ring a bell?...This movie was terrible. George Clooney is still trying to be a serious actor but can't shake off the same predictable acting he used effectively in ER, but gets annyoing in this movie. He is not even believable as a ship captain.....This Movie made money the same reason, Jurrasic Park's the Lost World and Independence day etc made theirs, for Special effects. Great special effects in the storm sequences, but everything is predictable and the director tried to bring it all together in the end which was even dragged out further. My word of Advice: Dont buy this piece of garbage or rent it. This was a waste of my time...."
2,Great special effects! Great movie....well.....,"In a nutshell, the special effects were VERY good. George and Mark was VERY good. The movie was VERY boring. How's that? Well, it may have been based on a true story about a ""perfect"" storm, but the entire story of the Andrea Gail is fabricated. No one really knows what happened on the ship. So the author fabricates this ""man vs. nature"" whatchamacallit and does and OKAY job. The first hour is a snore. ""We are men! We men catch fish!"" Whatever.Anyhow, it's just like the Titanic, the last hour is better than the first because, and ONLY because, of the special effects. Rent this first."
1,The perfect BOMB,"Man oh man! What a BAD movie! Do you hate films that have no intelligence? This movie is one you should stay away from. Not only is it overly cheesey, but it will make you stupid. (More stupid if you liked it). They try to tie in sentimental sub-plots, but they don't make sense. A kid cries, which is the most pathetic child-acting job in the world. It's not the kid's acting that is at fault, but the writer and director for letting it happen. They make these people out as heros. HEROS. Ok, whatever. Nothing is real, all tid-bits of dialog are dumbed down for the lower intelligence, for that's how movies make money. A good pointer to add is that the director did NOT use one REAL swordfish during the making of this. Did you think Air force One was stupid? This is worse. Good day."
2,"Great effects, but no story to keep you involved...","Like I said in the title of this review, there wasn't much of a story to keep you interested in this movie. There were great special effects but you have to wait until the end of the movie to see them, it seems like the script was written so that all of the characters could develop relationships with someone so that once you've seen the end you're supposed to be sad, but the plot develpment seems so deliberate that you don't really care. There isn't that much that happens in between the beginning and end to really move the picture. There isn't very much depth given to the characters to really care for them. Rent this one!"
1,George Clooney,"George Clooney is the worst actor ever. I also believe he is the most unintelligent actor ever. The movie itself is terrible, and George Clooney gives a typically terrible performance. Why waste your time with this trash when you could go to the nearest dumpster and find something infinitely more appetizing. I think George Clooney should be in a western...no thought, no emotion, just a surgeon's hands and a shiny gun, John Wayne did it, he could too."
2,"Great special effects, but somewhat exploitative","The unnamed 1991 storm took a tremendous toll in property and human life, including the crew of the ""Andrea Gail."" This story of the phenomenal storm of the century is interesting and the special effects are great - who won't shudder at the hundred-foot swells - but I couldn't help feeling like a voyeur as I watched the last days and hours of the ""Andrea Gail's"" captain and crew. This Hollywoodized version of their deaths seems somewhat exploitative. This is not and should not be considered ""entertainment."" Real people lost their lives."
5,Eyepopping special effects!,"The storm in the title is the star of this film, but the characters are very well drawn. I really enjoyed the stories of the lives of the men and women who make their living on the sea. The special effects will take your breath away!"
5,a superb recording of a wonderful exciting true story.,A true story that has been masterfuly put on film - I am sorry to see HD DVD go the way of BETA video - as a consumer we will never know the real reason for Toshiba's decision. Great price and very fast service thanks to purchase through Amazon.
3,"""Gloucester, They're Always From Gloucester""","Based on the true story of the ill-fated last voyage of the Andrea Gail which sailed out of Gloucester, Mass in '91 off into the North Atlantic only to fall victim to the ""Storm of the Century"". The '00 film `Perfect Storm' depicts the tragic event in dramatic style featuring a strong, likeable cast, superior special effects and a memorable soundtrack. If there's any fault to be found in this re-visioning of the last days of the Andrea Gail is would be the overly romanticized manner in which the crew is depicted. At times it was kind of like watching `The Magnificent Seven At Sea'.Rating: Overall `Perfect Storm' is an enjoyable watch with lots of familiar faces and fine performances; -3 Stars-."
4,love it,Love this machine. It is my second one. The first one was new but this is refurbished. It still works good.My first one was stolen.
4,Childhood all over again :),"I loved Bobbys World as a kid. And i still do now. When a friend pointed this out to me on the net i went insane. I had been searching for the show on TV...but no one played it anymore. Its only about $13 canadian so its a great buy. If you have kids, get it for them and they can experience the great time we had while watching it.It comes with a scratch and sniff card. I tried to figue out the smell for a while...but then i relised the answer was at the bottom. The card is a joke, it says ""[Answer: Cardboard]"". (a early reviewer did not notice this). The DVD also includes Uncle Ted's adventure (i believe thats the title), which teaches kids how to get over the very common fear. Fear of the Dark. The DVD also includes the episode with the very popular ""Fish Don't Stink"" song. I'd suggest this to anyone with 13 buck lying around.The one down side is that the episodes are of the normal quality. No upgrades, so it doesn't use the capibility of the DVD."
4,Bobby's World is an awesome place 2 visit,"I loved this cartoon as a kid, and I would watch it faithfully whenever it was on (after-school & weekends). I saw this while searching through the discount rack ($5.99) at the Best Buy across the street from my school and picked it up immediately. I'm happy that I did as about a week later I got pretty sick and laid in bed all day watching Bobby's World and it allowed me to laugh and reminisce, making feel worlds better in the process."
5,Blast From the Past,"This was an incredible dose of nostalgia. I highly recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the series. My only complaint is that its only 5 episodes long. What I REALLY want is the whole series on DVD. Oh well, maybe in the future..."
4,Bobby's World one of the best Fox Kids Shows.,"I was very excited to find that Bobby's World was out on dvd. These episodes were great but the dissapointment came when there were no special features, but at least they released some episodes. More should be released."
2,"Great show, lame DVD.","Bobby's World has always been one of my favorite shows growing up, so i was thrilled to find out it was finally coming to DVD. Unfortunetly, this DVD is VERY poorly made.Pros:-5 of the best Bobby's World episodes on DVD formatCons:-Picture quality is that of a VHS.-No special features.-All Fox Kids logos have been removed.-The Scratch 'n Sniff card is actually a joke. The smell of the card is... cardboard. Yeah, you heard right. The smell of the CARD is CARDboard. Of course, this was of no care to me, since i'm not 5, (i'm 19, actually, just reviewing it this way becuase it is quicker.) but kids are likely to buy this DVD and imagine the disappointment on their faces when their scratch and sniff card isn't really a scratch 'n sniff card at all.Overall, kids will enjoy the DVD, but be disappointed at the DVD's false advertising. Die hards fans shouldn't expect much in the way of extras, becuase there is none."
3,Bobby's World,"Bobby's World is obtaining a cult following these days, as Bobby's World merchandise is now widely available in Hot Topic stores. But I remember the show as a kid. I'm looking forward to this DVD for nostalgia reasons."
5,(Duran Duran 1st 3 cd box set) Great if you don't have them already.,"I had ""greatest"" & wanted to expand on that so when I found this package I ordered it. The version I got contains the remastered cds in Jewel Cases (some editions may be in digi-packs or mini lp sleeves). For me this was idea but if you're a long time fan you probably have these already & there's nothing new here."
1,Attention Sheeple!,"I am a huge Durannie and always will be, but gone are the days when a band or record label can print a friggen number on a box of something we ALREADY OWN (on a dying format, no less) and re-re-resell it to me as a ""Collectible"".Screw you, EMI. You got my dollars for these albums on vinyl, cassette, and cd (I even have Rio on 8-track still!!!). Ya gets no more o' my dough.Missie"
4,This is a different look at the events of WW II,"This is the first part of what David Eisenhower's intended political biography of his grandfather. The main thrust of the book is how Eisenhower's decisions in WW II were made, and the tensions that existed in the USA/British alliance during the war. The Anvil/Dragoon controversy is given full length because it was one of the most contended points of the allaince. The fighting of the war is distinctly in the background. It isn't clear to me how much personal analysis David Eisenhower put into the fighting aspect of the book. In a number of places it seems that he relys on the historians. Because of this, I think that it is important to keep in mind that this probably isn't an important book in terms of military history, even though it is very important in terms of understanding the political aspects of the war. Almost all the other books on WW II ignore the political aspects."

2,Rushed,"By the book's end its early promise was lost. Subplots were overly contrived and ill-conceived. For instance, the marriage in couple of months? Come on! Characters would think the same paragraph to themselves throughout the book, much like Batman continually recounting the murder of his parents. About mid-way through, extraneous passages began to appear. I wondered if the authors had argued and mentally thrown in the towel. Compelled to finish, I was left dissapointed."
3,Tepid Sci-Fi At Best,"Boooooring. The only reason why I'm reading these prequels of the prequels penned by hacks Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin J. Anderson is because my mom insists that I do.TBJ sets up the reasons behind the Butlerian Jihad, a violent, religious uprising against the thinking machines who have enslaved countless worlds committing obscene atrocities against humanity.TBJ, like the first set of prequels, lacks the depth of character and storyline that the original Dune books have. The short chapters reminds one of a poor episodic television programming attempt. Whatever."
1,er A1O58KEEMZQ0I3,"The writing itself was fine. The story and attention to detail was horrible. The book read like a 600 page introduction in which every piece of the action was totally predictable. There was not even a hint of the plot complexities usually associated with Frank Herbert's Dune books. The three prequels where masterpieces next to this book.The only highlight of the whole thing is reading about the origins of what will be the Dune universe. ...I thought the other three Dune novels by Brian Herbert and Anderson were pretty worthy prequels. ""The Butlerian Jihad,"" by contrast, misses the mark completely. I rarely give only one star to a book that I have actually finished, but this one will be an exception. ......"
1,Horrible,"Please, save your money. On one of the first pages the author commends his typist for keeping up with his manic work pace. And this is what it reads like - I guess not even the author wanted to see his written pages a second time."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I've read all of the Dune books (by Frank Herbert) and the previous prequel series by the son and friend. The earlier prequel series, (Houses Atreides, Harkonnen, Corino) was at least interesting and added something to the Dune mythology. I looked forward to reading them.This book promised to provide the prehistory of much of what is only alluded to in the prior books. It ""delivers"" that in a leaden style, with obvious plot lines, stilted dialogue, and a really boring story. And, as we find out only when we buy (or borrow) the book, it's really the first of a new three-book prequel series. Thanks, Kevin and Brian, but no thanks. I bought this book and read it. I don't plan to buy any of the others. I'm not even sure I'd bother to get them from the library and read them, although I'm a real science fiction fan and a fan of the Dune series.Don't buy this book!"
2,so-so,"all i have to say is im disappointed. not as good as the origional dune series, litte worse than the first 3 prequels. i just hope the next two in this trilogy are actually worth the money."
1,Tsk Tsk,"Well, I confess first - I do NOT love all of Frank Herbert's Dune books. In fact. after Children of Dune, I find them very plodding and pathetic, the work of a man who obviously stretched a trilogy into much more than he could handle. I DID like the prequel ""House"" books, simply based on entertainment value (despite the obvious consistency issues and the weak ending).That being said, this might be the worst of all of them. ""The Butlerian Jihad"" neither retains the unique vision found in the first three F. Herbert books, nor the outlandish beach-read entertainment of the B. Herbert trilogy. I won't embarass anyone with a plot summary - there is no plot of which to speak. I will simply say that I checked the book out of the library over a period of eight months, and it took every bit of my patience to put this abomination to rest."
4,Did we all read the same book?,"This book was GREAT. No, it wasn't Frank Herbert. His writing style is unique. But after reading this, I went back to the original series and read it for references to the Jihad. There are hardly ANY. I think Kevin and Brian did a great job of portraying the Old Empire, and the thinking machines.I loved the twist of history's losing track of who the Atreides were actually related to, and that history is often wrong. Doesn't anyone remember was Leto II said about history? It was never what we think it should have been like, and the people that disliked this book already had a preconcieved notion of what it should have been. Write your own book!"
2,Brian Herbert is no Frank Herbert,"I almost shelled out [money] for this, instead of waiting to check out a copy at the library. I'm glad I waited. Mostly disappointing. It started losing credibility when the robots and thinking machines were described as nonemotional, logical and unable to understand humans. Intelligent machines created by human beings will probably resemble human beings (see Hofstaders ""Godel, Escher, Bach""). Erasmus was nasty, but not at all believable. The Titans were ridiculous. The sorceress of Rossak who is a main character is wooden in her obsessiveness. The only particularly interesting part of this book was the sections which describe the Zensunni on Arrakis. If you must read this book, wait for a copy at your library. Then dig out your copy of ""Dune"" and reread it, and the ""Dune Encyclopedia"" if you have it. Much more interesting."
4,Much better than critics allow,"I have not read the original ""Dune"" yet. I intend to read them all in chronological order, thus, this book is first in the timeline. I was not burdened with the notion of a ""letdown"" and enjoyed it as interesting space opera that's clearly setting the reader up with many characters, planets, and plot directions. I feel fortunate that I haven't the preconceived notions of the original Dune readers who can't accept the Anderson/Herbert book(s)."
4,"Love this story,...",This a re-read for me. I love visiting this universe. Great story of a great struggle. I Highly recommend it.
4,great reintroduction,It was such fun to read this story and see all of the early genesis stories for so much of what happens later in the series.
4,A good beginning,This books is a very good beginning of the Dune Universe Saga. I liked the fast paced chapters. the characters were good and you just cant wait to se how this unfolds. Harkonnen and Atreides will be enemies and I cant wait to se how that will play out.Many of the coming story elements i the Dune books gets their beginning in this story. I really recommend this book as a good Scifi story and if you are into the Dune books then this is a must read.Bruno Horvat
2,Not sure where to start,"The previous trilogy, to the events just prior to Dune, I enjoyed a lot and didn't take me long to read. Since I've started this book, I've slowed down and haven't enjoyed reading it as much. The techno babble in it is a bit much, the writing style is questionable, and I wish I had not bought it on my Kindle. I've tried to not look at it as part of the Dune Universe to try and help me finish the book, but the classic names keep on coming up in strange places. I'm not entirely certain Frank would have approved of this book, but could be wrong."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"If you were considering buying this book, I would highly recommend that you do not. If you have not read Dune then I would instead recommend that. And then of course read the entire original series. Then maybe wait a certain length of time and then read them again. Then you will be ready to begin to read this book. Do not buy it. That would be a huge waste of money. Just get a copy from the library and then try to read it all the way through. Maybe you will make it to the end. But before you even get very far you will begin to understand the difference between art and mediocrity. And you will appreciate the genius of Frank Herbert and also that genius unfortunately rarely transmits genetically."
3,Dune...The Beginning,"Certinaly not the ""Master's"" work but failrly solid in content. The plot developemt is accomplished through sporatic 2 - 4 page segments and I prefer longer development periods. I have read all the Dune segments by Mr. Herbert numerous times and consider this a good start to picking up his work. I look forward to reading the other books in Brian's issues."
4,Good Story - Read it if you like Dune,"I liked the book immensely. A lot of the negative reviews I've read here make valid points, but I thought it was a good story with some cool ideas. I've read the House Trilogy too and I do agree that the overall quality has declined with each release from Brian and Kevin. I'll continue to read everything related to Dune, but I wish that these guys would slow down and take more time if they need it. It took Frank over 20 years to write the first 6 Dune books. At the rate they are going, Brian and Kevin will have 6 out in just 5 years. So don't rush it guys - especially for Dune 7."
2,milking it!,"I am a dune Junkie, and having given this book 2 stars, I will still buy the next book.But this was really sad. Basically, the purpose of this book is to set the stage for the next two. And the purpose of these three (Other than the obvious financial reasons) is to give us the origins of all the mythology that the Frank Herbert created as a backdrop for his series.In and of itself this is fine, but the implementation is [not good]. The characters are shallow, the historical representations are unsophisticated and the emotional content is sophomoric.After about the first hundred pages, I read it out of some perverse desire to reach the conclusions promised in the opening chapter. But was denied even that.Get this book if you are a Dune fan, if not, don't waste your money"
1,A big disappointment. Poorly written and unconvincing.,"The thing that made the original ""Dune"" novel so great was its plausibility. It imparted a sense of reality and wonder that translated into real authenticity. The characters seemed like real people living on real planets in the far distant future.This book fails to do any of that. Having read all of the previous Dune books, I had lots of questions about, and notions about, what the ""Butlerian Jihad"" had comprised. When I read this book my reaction was ""you have got to be kidding.""I thought the other three Dune novels by Brian Herbert and Anderson were pretty worthy prequels. ""The Butlerian Jihad,"" by contrast, misses the mark completely. I rarely give only one star to a book that I have actually finished, but this one will be an exception. Save your money.The authors can do better and should have known better. I don't know how they managed to produce this turkey."
2,A shadow of the original,"I didn't expect a lot, which was a good thing. Herbert and Anderson have produced ""mainstream SF"" -- decent characterization, interesting ideas, and adequate plot, but lacking the richness and brilliantly constructed framework of Dune. As other reviewers have mentioned, the authors practically bash you over the head with things they want you to ""get,"" rather than let you puzzle it out yourself like the inimitable Frank Herbert did.Bottom line: it's enjoyable enough for a bit of light reading, and for the game of exploring the possible history of the Dune universe, but don't expect anything nearly as good as the classic Dune series."
1,Former Dune Fan,"OK - I am done with Dune. The original series, written by F. Herbert, was excellent - it was so well detailed and written that I could almost smell the spice. The Butlerian Jihad, however, has convinced me to move on. This work was poorly written, poorly thought out, and wordy instead of detailed; it was a silly book.The Titans, the evermind, the other thinking machines were all comic caricatures of what they could have been. The inane dialog was so mind-numbing, I had to struggle through each page.My advice: read ANYTHING else- anything. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity."
1,Disappointing but still a Must,This book is a must for Dune fans but I found it shallow and rushed. It filled in some blanks but left me wanting more. I guess the botttom line my be that Brian is not Frank.
1,I give up.,"I started these prequels because I wanted a glimpse into Frank Herbert's notes. I'm not sure if it's worth the agony of reading them to get the shreds of information that they contain.They didn't have to imitate slavishly Frank Herbert's books, but it seems that they didn't even understand wherein lay the orginal books' greatness.Simply put: If you liked and could appreciate the original novels, these are NOT for you. If you thought the originals were needlessly dense and complex without much ""action,"" then, by all means, give these new books a try."
3,FIlls in the blanks...,"I ordered just to ""fill in the blanks"" for the early days of the Dune saga, which it did. But that's about it. If you're OK with that then I would recommend, otherwise you can skip it."
3,all right,"Out of all the McDune books that Brian and Kevin wrote, I found the Butlerian Jihad trilogy to be the most enjoyable out of them all. However, the same writing problems abound in all of the books, regardless of what it's about - useless detail, flat characters, and clunky writing in some places.Serena Butler was such a Mary Sue that it was not even funny. Beautiful, purple eyes, graceful, sweet, etc. I just couldn't stand her. I found the parts with the Titans more interesting, to be honest. Overall the Butlerian Jihad is better than any of the other MdDune books, but it doesn't stand much on its own. This story would have been better if it was an entirely original creation by Brian and Kevin instead of a non-canon, fanfiction-esque extension of the Dune universe."
3,"Not 'Dune,' but not bad either","If you're looking for another 'Dune,' don't bother - that's book in a different class. But if you're looking for something in the same universe that is fun to read, fast paced and keeps entertained, then this is not a bad book. I enjoyed reading it (despite some of the very annoying characters in the story - but they appear to be deliberately created that way."
1,Even worse than I expected,"Addicted as I am to the Dune books, like the spice, I felt compelled to purchase and read the book. How, oh how, can this be worse than the previous prequels? Other reviewers have noted the linear, uninspired plot and characters. Certainly, this is true, but more maddening is that in the hands of Son of Frank the legend becomes something of a joke. And there is more to come--notice the *forthcoming books in the series? Lovers of the originals pray for reproductive technology to advance quickly enough to replace the current undynamic team of writers with a ghola of the original Herbert.Money is one reason authors write books. If this is the motivation, fine, but the Herbert family should accept royalties and find an author or authors who would at least work to keep Frank Herbert's vision alive."
2,Does Anyone Proof Read Kindle Versions?,"This is a review solely of the quality of the Kindle version of the book. I am still reading it so this review does not touch on the story, but rather the lack of quality of proof-reading the Kindle version.It certainly seems to me that the publisher did not re-format the printed version, especially where individual words were hyphenated because of line spacing issues on the printed pages, so there are needless and distracting hyphenations throughout the book. Also, just today I ran across the words ""for ward"" when they really were intended to be ""forward"". This Kindle version of the book is full of errors and I certainly think that the publisher should subject the text to a word processor for formatting and possible grammar errors, but mostly for the bad hyphenation issues.I may come back and either amend this review or write a new review concerning the content of the book. But first I need to com-plete it."
2,Let down,"The original Dune series and the first three prequels sewed the tantilizingly obscure seeds of the ancient man vs. machine conflict called the Butlerian Jihad. Everything that happens later has its origins there. Clearly the Jihad was THE event that shaped the Dune universe.I grabbed this new prequel the week it was released. I was expecting an epic, tourtured narrative of mankinds near extermination a la Benford's ""Great Sky River."" What I got was brains floating in jars, seriously. How 1950s sci-fi cliche is that? These poor plot choices combined with no real ending made this an agonizing read. I just never believed that THIS scenario created the Dune universe. This is a pulp novel of the disposable kind. Not a bad read in and of itself, but not really worthy of the Dune legacy. I'm going to pretend it didn't happen."
3,Wait for the paperback...,"Despite what you've read elsewhere, this book doesn't answer any of the questions that you might expect. The only real item from this era covered thorougly in this book is Holtzmann, and he comes across as a standard scientist character (see other reviews).The beginnings of the Sisterhood are hinted at, folding space is touched on, the origins of the Bene Theliax are explored a bit. And that's about it. The whole book spends its time setting up things, but not explaining anything. Yeah, there's a backstory of the Jihad itself but that's not why Dune fans bought the book.The Mentats aren't brought out, the use of Melange by the Sisterhood isn't explored (they shun drugs at this point), the Harkkonen betrayal, the Guild, the final extermination of the computer minds, and many other things are all left up in the air......for a sequel."
1,Avoid all of the books by these guys,Horrible. Terrible. A waste of my time. Completely at odds with the wonderful universe his father created. Don't bother.
1,Not worth the time,"I've made it half way through the book and am not sure I can finish it. I was quite pleased with the first Dune prequel-triology and so I anticipated this one would be up to that calibre. There are, however, a few key problems with it:1) The writing style is overly simplistic and lacks imagination. On top of that, it's just not believable nor overly original.2) The chapters are so episodic, that they rarely move the plot any substantial distance.3) The book is poorly edited. Facts are unnecessarily repeated. It's almost though they were trying to push up the page count.I'd skip it if I were you."
1,"Mostly boring, worth fast-reading for hardcore fans","It's a shame what these two authors are doing with the great reputation of the Dune in the series of books ""Legends of Dune"" (well, everybody has to make money somehow). The main plot is somewhat interesting for those who really like the Dune and world sketched by Frank Herbert. But the details are utterly boring. You can read a sentence of each paragraph for most parts of the book and you will not miss a thing! I really don't understand why this book (and others in the series) where so long. And the epitaphs? They tell you the point of the chapter, and who is the main ""player"" in it, but are no match to Frank Herbert's intriguing ones."
2,This is a disgrace to Dune Novels,"I'm a 13 year old Dune fan, and I love the world of Dune, the Spice, the plots, the imagination. Butlerian Jihad is a disgrace. The plot of the Butlerian Jihad is awful and not interesting. I hate the theme about robots are conquering the world. Dialogue is very boring and uninteresting. Writing style is awful. Not worth it reading. Worst DUne book yet. A bomb to all DUne novels, you will get bored of it after a while."
2,Oh Man,"Umm ok I didn't buy the book(20 mins. at a local B&N was all I needed) and people I liked the last serise that Brian and Kevin did really but MAN this is just.. too different.So...#1 Save your money#2 (This is for Kevin) Please Mr. Anderson save yourself!! Get back to writting Star Wars.#3 (This is for Brian) Brian just because your last name is the same is your father's doesn't mean that you can write ""Dune"" like he did.Get some more of your own stuff published and then get back to carrying on your father's legacy."
1,Juvenile,"I loved Dune. It wasn't one of the greatest novels ever written but it was fantastic sci-fi and a damn good read.This isn't. It's filled with hack dialogue, technologies that sound like they were invented by a fifteen year old in 1950, gaping plot holes (why on Earth didn't the Titans ever think to use the humans against the machines?), and lacks all complexity."
3,Just OK...,"unfortunately, I got one of my bibliophiliac attacks and bought nearly all of the books of the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson entries to the DUNE saga. Let's say that this is the last time I start collecting before I'm positive about the quality... after I read ""Butlerian Jihad"", I moved right on to ""Machine Crusade"" but put it down after only a few chapters.These are on the pulpish side, the writing just so-so, perhaps a quick summer read (if you really want to spend 700 + pages on it), but nothing particularly impressive."
2,Not the best of the Dune Series,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the first three prequels written by the duo (and the original Dune series), I was dissappointed with this one. Without the inspiration and perhaps plot lines of Frank Herbert's original characters, this book fell short. The second half of the book was significantly better than the first half, but I'm not sure that it is worth slogging through the first 300 pages to get the payoff. The book also ends abruptly just when it becomes engaging. I'd recommend House Corrino, House Atreides, and House Harkonnen, but not this one."
5,Great new part of Dune history,"At last, the new Dune authors can really show their stuff! The House prequels were fascinating, but tied so closely to the originals, it was hard for Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson to show their own originality. Now, in a story set ten thousand years before DUNE, all the characters and places are new and fresh. Very dramatic, even heartbreaking. And Erasmus the robot is one of the coolest, funniest, and most sadistic characters I've ever read. A very good start to a very good trilogy."
1,Why do they hate Frank Herbert so much?,"I read this ""book"" a while back and waited to calm down to write this review. That was a mistake, in that I mercifully have purged much of it from my head and would not accept anything less than a fortune to read it again.The characters are bad, the science awful and the attention to details from the original (read ""good"") indicates they just didn't give a damn. (Admittedly, history can change over millenia but back it up with some kind of rationale.) I had thought the three prequels to be the worst perversions I'd ever see; I was wrong.While I'd like to go on and on about how much I hate this book it just isn't worth it. Others have done so quite well. The fact 38/132 (as of June 26, 2003) have given it only one star should be evidence enough.Please heed this warning, however: SAVE YOUR MONEY; MOREOVER, SAVE YOUR TIME. YOU'LL REGRET PUTTING EITHER OF THESE INTO THIS BOOK...."
2,"Ideas aren't bad, but execution is execrable","The writing in this novel is not even up to the standard of the three ""House"" prequels this team has already cranked out.These authors need to repeat the mantra ""Show, don't tell"" a thousand times. They continuously tell the back stories of the characters rather than showing them by their actions and interactions. When the story returns to the characters, the authors compound this failure by repeating the back stories.It's a shame the writing gets in the way of the story the authors try to tell. Generally, the story is not bad. There are a couple of occasions when characters respond in ways that seem excessively simple-minded; motivations do not always seem to match to response in the book.I would not encourage anyone who isn't already a Dune fan to pick this book up. This book fails to follow basic creative writing rules."
2,They are losing creativity,"I have read all the prequels, and the disappointing downward trend continues. The cover flaps promise much but do not deliver, ie, the basis for the Atredies/Harkonen feud and others. The authors are overly possesed with how much violence and brutality the robots can inflict, but it is well overdone by several orders of magnitude. While entertaining, as a whole it loses cohesivness as it jumps from snip-it to snip it. It's worth reading, but wait til it comes out in paperback."
1,Dune Cartoon,"A lost opportunity to develop the origins of the Dune series. Anyone buying this book hoping for a literature level science fiction read will be sorely disappointed. At best this effort is a cartoon; a space opera without plot, depth, characters or anything else that you look for in adult fiction. One star is a gift for this total miss."
4,satisfied customer,i throughly enjoy the dune series for its interesting read. i bought my dune books from amazon because i like there shipping prices and book prices. i think there quite fair.
2,Unfortunately...,"...Brian's writing style is not quite the same as his father's. I've only read a couple of the Dune books, but I've read enough to be disappointed by this. I agree with most of the criticisms listed here. The characters are shallow and their behavior often idiotic. The plot is predictable, and cliche in many places. It reads like a kid's Saturday morning cartoon series."
1,Feh!,"Absolutely horrible. Both fans of the series and the elder Herbert's memory would have been better served by an edited version of the latter's notebooks, not this cheap tripe. This is the only prequel I have read (I forced myself to finish it), and the only one I will.Don't waste your money. Or your time: if offered it for free, politely decline. Ghastly."
1,Rubbish!,"I have never found myself actually getting angry at a series of books but these have done it to me! These books have none of the subtlety or depth of Frank Herberts original books and they are filled with one dimensional plots and characters such as Rhomber ""er"" Vernius and Piter de Vries, this second example illustrating proof that the authors have not even read the originals, otherwise they would know that this character's name was in fact Piter de Vried! There are just so many inconsistancies as to make these books laugable if it wasn't so frustrating and a list of these inconsitancies could fill a book on their own. ...In summary where Frank Herberts novels were the pinnacle of the writers art, and perhaps one of the great feats of fiction this book and the the other preludes written by Brian Herbert/Kevin Anderson are in the absolute pit of pulp rubbish. ..."
1,"Bene Gesserit analysis of ""Butlerian Jihad""","The Sisters pouring over the archives on Chapterhouse have discovered..oh wait..I can't do it..I just can't do it!I have written my reviews of the prequals in the ""manner"" of the Bene Gesserit, it was my way to honor the memory of the great Frank Herbert and to point out the errors in his son's books. I am not a writer, but I think I did a better job that these two. I cannot understand the massive amount of errors in all of these books, didn't they read the origionals?I just cannot get past the first few chapters, it is soooooooo poorly written it is painfull.I will now move on to something else and leave this silly series in the garbage can."
1,Butlerian Johad Review,"I'm only a quarter of the way into the book and I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it. The plot is weak and the action weaker yet. Many of the descriptions are irrelevant and I'm finding the book terribly verbose. The characters are so thin they're practically transparent. The science is weak to non-existent. The battle tactics are unbelievable. The style lacks the craftsmanship you'd expect from even a journeyman writer. I could go on, but you get the picture. I've never written a review before, but this sad excuse for a book has prompted me to do so."
2,"Plodding, predictable, derivative.","It seems that the ""Dune"" universe has been turned into another imaginationless formulaic cash-cow. The first couple of chapters were actually fairly intriguing and hooked me, after that I had to drag myself through the rest. I predicted the ending at about the 1/3 mark and after that not much surprised me or engaged me. Imagine killing a massive all powerful super computer with a virus! Oh man, how original! Characters were one dimensionally unbelievable.This book borrowed from daddy and other writers diluted it all down with mediocre writing an cashed in. If you absolutely can't get enough Dune, dig it out of your local used book store, and bring a clothespin."
3,Super Reader,"We see what the Butlerian Jihad is. An articially intelligent robot experiments in various nasty ways upon humans to discover more about them and the nature of life. Serena Butler is one of these, and she has a child. The computer tyrant Omnius basically control all civilisation.When the robot Erasmus kills her child, Serena is a rallying point for a human resistance movement to spring up and fight for human control of their own destiny."
2,"Pulled from the Big Book of ""Sci Fi"" Cliches...","The originals were so rich and thought provoking that I believe my IQ increased a couple of points. The prequels, on the other hand, are standard-issue space opera. On their own, they're enjoyable, even though the characters are as wooden as an Al Gore speech. As part of the Dune universe, however, they fall on their face in a spectacular way. I've seen reviews where the prequels have been blasted and ""disowned"" by so-called Dune loyalists. Although I do not personally consider the recent books to be within the borders of Frank Herbert's fictional realm I must say to the aforementioned reviewers that you should consider that it IS fiction we are discussing here. As far as I'm concerned, the new ones are fun in a goofy sort of way, while the originals expanded my thinking, so who cares, really? It's still a win-win situation. Have fun!"
5,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book. I've read two Dune books in the past, but not a true ""Dooner"". I liked the SF and I thought the characters and story line were very interesting."
4,A Good Distraction,"I couldn't ask for anything better. Every year in October a new Dune book and every January a warm beach to lay down on and read these novels. while these books are nowhere near as complex and philososphical as the original series, they are solid books an their own. They transport you to another time and expose to you to new worlds. The authors do an excellent job in developing the characters we have grown to love (and hate).I recommend this book without reservations"
1,By far the weakest Dune book,"I love very much the book Dune and its sequels. But this book is very different. This book could serve as the storyline of a third class sci-fi production of Hollywood dripping with blood and nothing more - an interesting book, but it is very-very far from the original books of Frank Herbert. Borrow it from a library and read it, then forget."
1,I wish they allowed zero stars.,"I bought the first book Frank Herberts son wrote, and for some reason I bought the next 3. They are all horrible, and I shan't spend another cent on this series or anything else this man ever rights."
1,Uggghhhhh,"Boy, was this book bad. I couldn't get through it quickly enough and onto my next read. None of the complexity of Frank's work. To call the characters ""two-dimensional"" is being generous.Is there a synopsis of the following two books? I'd rather not endure the chore of actually reading them.You know what really scares me? Certainly not a moron like Erasmus. Rather, the fact that B&K; are writing two books to follow Chapterhouse. Let's hope they take some of the magic pixie dust that helped Frank come up with such awesome stuff and hopefully avoid the sophomoric tendencies that led to this drivel.But semi-seriously, I suspect the only reason serious Dune fans spend time on these pulp novels is that we are so hooked on the entire Dune universe that we will wade through the horrible writing just to find out ""what happens"". Who can resist knowing something of the Butlerian Jihad?One final question: when are the Dune comics and pop-up books due? ;-)"
1,Very Dissapointing,"The Butlerian Jihad is not a worthwhile book within the Dune series. It takes away the magic of several of Dune's institutions by bringing a corny, trite story that is more suitable for a cheap soap opera than a prelude to the great Dune books. The previous trilogy by Frank Herbert's son had been very good, however I really do not know what went wrong on this one. The language is ghastly (trite phrases like ""a silence that could speak volumes""), or very corny descriptons of a weak love story, weak plot and weak story line."
1,Overwritten,Give this one a pass! The authors crammed this title full of useless detail and failed to connect most of the story with the beginning of the parent novel. Seems that they are building a prequel trilogy to link to the parent story.This was built on a great idea but failed to follow through.
2,Disappointing,"Turgid and easy to put down.The last prequel series was fairly interesting, and I was looking forward to this one, but this thing lacks energy, invention or characterization. It just plods. I can't seem to get through more than 20 pages at a time before I'm thinking about necessary chores I could be doing. Doubt I'll finish it.2 stars for ""has moments"""
3,Getting Better but still Immature,"The authors are improving. However, they seem to be unable to create ""evil"" characters that are believable. For instance, the Cymek Ajax in this installment is portrayed as nothing short of a maniac. This shallow development does not allow for any complex exploration of his motivations and loyalaties.However, I have noticed an improvement is the authors ability to create beleivable characters that are not at their extremes of good and evil."
2,Same Old Things,"I have read every book to carry the ""Dune"" title. I have loved the series from the first installment, and still love it with the latest work by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson. Unfortunately, the series didnt love me back this time.I got through the book in about 3 days, but while I was on the edge of my seat (like in the other books), the end didn't hold up as the other aspects of the novel did. I hate to ruin the summary for anybody, but the origins that it claims to explain of the various groups in the Dune universe aren't told in detail, rather they are glossed over without any direct reference.I would only recommend this book to VERY DEDICATED Dune fans, anybody else, go get the Sci-Fi movie."
3,A disappointment,"I should give this book fewer than 3 stars, because I really didn't like it, but I don't want to give the preferences system idea that I don't like Dune books or scifi in general.This book is not good. It's also not really a Dune book. It lacks the wheels-within-wheels plot development that I've come to like so much. The characters are undeveloped and the plot thin. The only reason to read it is for insights into the beginnings of things that are ongoing or talked about in the other Dune books."
2,"Rabid Dune fans only, please","This book is worthwhile only in the context of its sire, the immortal _Dune_ and the other lesser volumes in *Frank* Herbert's original series. Read all those volumes before devoting time and money to this pale shadow of the original. The style is weak and the characterization is shallow. The plot is interesting only to the extent that it makes interesting speculations about the historical background of the original."
2,disappointing,"This book, in addition to the story behind the Butlerian Jihad, was supposed to give the origins of the Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Suk, swordmasters, and Guild, at least according to the inside front cover. Unless my copy was missing some pages, it barely touches on the precursors to the BG. The book is also supposed to explain the betrayal between Houses Harkonnen and Atreides. It seems to explain it away as a misunderstanding that is later resolved. So, is there another betrayal later, after the Houses are actually formed?? This book doesn't remotely live up to its potential. They probably just wanted to make some more money. They must write another one to resolve the above issues."
1,boring,"Well, if you ask me, the Herbert/Anderson team aren't doing a very good job with Frank Herbert's legacy. The characters don't have any depth, and the plotting isn't much above Buck Rogers. You'd think that Brian Herbert would have learned something about developing complex novels from his dad. Even more bothersome, is that they don't seem to be following the clues about the Old Empire that Frank Herbert dropped here and there. And I don't know how much of the Dune Encyclopedia had Frank Herbert's imprint, but the characters of Butler, Holtzman, etc. directly contradict what's in the Dune Encyclopedia. Don't waste your money on this book until it comes out in paperback..."
4,A solid fourth installment in the Dune prequel series,"The Butlerian Jihad is a very entertaining book, and that is why I gave it four stars. I still read books for the pure enjoyment of it, and discovering the ways in which Frank Herbert's son imagines(and hopefully researched) that the Dune Universe, the one that we all know from the origional Dune, came to be is about as enjoyable as most storylines I can envision. That said, this book is not incredibly well written. The character developement is the poorest of any book in the series so far, and the plot lines take on some awefull turns. The predictability gave way to a feeling of a massproduced science-fiction story that was released more to make money than to pay tribute to the world of Dune. If you are looking for a litterary masterpiece, move on, but if you are looking for a highly entertaining read that is near impossible to put down (no matter how predictable it sometimes can be) look no further."
4,"Great book, Horrible Kindle Edition","I enjoyed the book a lot. I've read some of the other reviews and I can't agree with their appraisal of the writing or story. I was a fan before reading this book and I'm still just as much of a fan.However, my review really should focus on the Kindle version of this. To put it simply, it's horrible. I've read quite a few books now that were done by major publishers that didn't have any errors. This had TONS. There were random hyphenations, strange italics, odd characters appearing in places and dozens of other little issues.For the price that we're paying for this and the fact that it's such a large publishing house putting it out, we should not see so many flaws."
4,Good just don't expect Frank!,"This is a good adventure story and the characters (especially Erasmus) are well drawn and the story is interesting. However, this is not Frank Herbert. On its own this book is pretty good, in comparison to Frank Herbert's Dune novels this book isn't all that great. So don't compare it to Frank's work, let it stand on its own, and enjoy a fun adventure!"
1,"Done with ""Dune""","To be succinct, this is a bad book. Poorly written, slackly plotted, full of cliches and predicabilities, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have succeeded in grinding Frank Herbert's brilliant creation into pure, unreadable hackwork.Their previous trilogy of ""Dune"" prequels (""House Atreides"", ""House Harkonnen"" and ""House Corinno"") was acceptable at best, but at least held my interest, even as I was aware that the overall quality of the writing was deteriorating as the series progressed. Now, however, they cannot provoke even the momentary suspension of disbelief, as every page, practically every paragraph, is larded with indigestible chunks of bad writing.This guys have succeeded in putting me off the ""Dune"" universe for good, something that Frank Herbert, even at his worst, never came close to doing. Good work, fellows, you have managed to convert gold into dross."
5,Who needs sex when you have Clann Zu?,"Y'know - I've sat down for the past 4 hours listening to Rua over and over again just being completely flabbergasted.Then I got angry because it was flawless.And I hated the fact it was perfect.Because there's no perfection in the world.Or so I thought.Then Clann Zu did it - and changed my perception on things.People, the album is just f-ing perfect. Music orgasms. Over and over again. And I wish I had more significantly journalistic critical adjectives to describe the album and fancy smancy ways of comparing it to other bands and all the technicalities of it musical wise but I really don't.It's an amazing album.Forget Sex. Forget Krispy Kreme's.This is it. Nothing beats this.And yes, it's THAT good."
4,Girls enjoy it,"I think the Irish stories are better, but maybe it is personal preference. What matters is that the girls love all of Kennedy's CDs, and listen to them every night before going to bed. Then they act out the stories during the day. Not a waste of money at all."
3,The sordid world of the criminal,"Steve McQueen always was involved in bending the law, both on the screen and in his private life. He was born in Missouri; this one takes place in Missouri, and it uses the same policemen in the cast that were there in the original robbery. One thing about McQueen is that he has actor friends that appear in several films with him. It is interesting to see all of them as they get older. If you watch this one a few times, you can appreciate that each of the robbers contributes a significant part to the whole that makes the robbery organized. But a more subtle question is: what did the group of robbers have that caused their downfall ? To contrast this one, early in McQueen's career, see ""The Getaway"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" By then, McQueen has discovered that maybe a robbery can be successful !!"
4,A cheap movie with a great story,"The first time I watched the Great St. Louis Bank Robbery I didn't know what to expect. I had never heard of the historic events that form the basis of the movie, and frankly I had never heard of this movie either.This movie feels more like a play or graphic novel. There are no fancy stunts or even fancy camera work. It's a simple story about a disastrous set of decisions that leads to a lousy day in St. Louis.As for acting, well, the actors over reach and clearly Steve McQueen was still developing his cool guy persona. What makes this movie compelling is the downward spiral of Steve McQueen's character (and the weird ""time capsule"" feel the movie projects to modern audiences). In this movie, McQueen could project tough, but cool ... not so much.In keeping with the low budget feel of the movie, the transfer to DVD is low budget too. Don't bother placing this on a high def TV. An old analog TV is this movie's proper home."
2,Skeptical,I think the exercises from the book will make you stronger and healthier but they will not make you taller. You should treat this book as an leisure book.Some of the readers mentioned they grew taller after they did the exercises. It is because they are children or teenagers. They will grow taller even though they did not do any exerise.The other readers complained they did not grow taller even though they tried the exercises very hard. It is because they are over 25-year old adult and their growth plates have already closed.
5,I really am impressed,I would first like to congratulate the Author on a well written book. I am very impressed with the fact that I actually did increase my height by almost 2 inches. I did every thing the book told me to do and I received results. Thank you so much Mr. Cummings. I feel so much more confident about myself now.
3,Don't Know!,Yes t maybe true that theres a lot of books out that are trying just to make a few quick bucks. And i don't about this one.But if anyone out there could recommend me a different book i would highly appreciated! Thank You
1,Had no results from it,"I bought this book about 18 months ago and followed everything recommended by Steven Cummings. I had not grown a bit until I started to work on the other program (from another book). Also I would point out that it was not easy to follow everything, especially by comparing to another program I'm working with right now, especially for a girl."
2,Not happy,"For 4 months already I'm doing what the author explained in the book. I think I should stop because, first of all I did not gained any height, and now I see that it was written by the guy who goes not know much about all this. Now I understand that the book does not have to be larger and nicer to be more usefull."
1,inferior quality,"Paint clogs nozzle in short or long term use, regardless of temperature. Paint doesn't always mix properly, which leads to improper spray pattern and won't let paint cure properly. Nozzle leaks leaving paint all over your hands. All directions and conditions followed."
1,For the love of the kill,"The author is unable to grasp the true concept of a psychopath.He tries by using explicit language, but the idea is just notthere. Fortunately, the book was in paperback, but buy it used.The book is just violent and full of jumbled ideas."
4,"""could have been, would have been, if given the chance...""","It's amazing that the author is walking around as a free man. A glimpse into his psyche through his words reveal a criminal. Nevertheless, it also reveal a talented story teller."
3,"Great Chants, Confusing Packaging","Like the previous reviewers, I agree that the music on this album is well done. But like the last reviewer, I find it confusing to discern what I am listening to at times. There are 21 tracks listed on the album, but only 15 register. However, the album clocks in at just over an hour(the album claims to be 58:11 minutes), so my guess is that all the tracks listed are on the album, but are recorded as 15 tracks. I would have gladly paid more for this album if it was packaged better, with lyrics and footnotes, and if it was clearer which track you are listening to. Maybe the original reviewer of this album has some insight into this album that she will share at some time. Other than that, a fine album of traditional Advent music that will assist you to slow down, and meditate on the Spirit of the Season of Advent in preparation for the Coming of Christmas."
2,"I was looking forward to enjoying this book, but....","S.P. Somtow writes wonderful short stories and I can easily recommend them. His novel ""Jasmine Nights"" is very well written, extremely entertaining and on my list for one of the best books I read last year.Unfortunately ""Vanitas"" was a bit tough for me to get through. I don't think the author spent much time editing this book and in the end, I was to the point of not caring what happened.I was looking forward to enjoying this book, but I didn't. Save your time and skip this one but DO read ""Jasmine Nights"" - you will not be sorry."
1,Doesn't fit OEM Jeeps.,"I bought this because it said it would fit a 1991 Jeep Wrangler, But you have to remove the OEM ""Button"" from the window and glue theirs on to make it work.There is nothing special about this mirror, so if your looking to glue one on you can buy one for substantially less, I was willing to pay a bit extra if it worked with the button on the glass, but returned it because it didn't fit."
5,Cuckoo,"Just one of the paragraphs of this humorous tale which grabbed me and confirmed more depth ahead. ""And from somewhere behind him a cuckoo called abruptly, an urchin sound, like a bit of street corner mischief, following him mockingly. And he heard in it as he always did the taunting, near demented glee of a bird that knew something nobody else yet knew, but any day now would.""The whole book continued with many paragraphs that painted a humerus picture of life in Batch Magna and the river that was the life flow of the town. I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful tale and the characters that soon became friends. It was one of those books when finished I immediately began missing them all. What every author wants from readers. Can't wait for whatever comes out of Peter Maughan's pen next."
5,Loved it!,I really love the Little People collection. Well I guess I should say that my daughter loves them. As soon as she sees them she gets excited and wants to play with them. I think these toys are absolutely perfect for little hands. The characters are so chunky that my daughter can easily pick them up and place them wherever she wants. Would love to continue her little collection. Absolutely love it!
2,"Poorly made, cheap hardware","Our house came with this system for the claw-foot tub, and I have the receipts that show it was installed in 2002 -- three years before we bought the house. In those three years, the ceramic on the hot water handle cracked and, soon after we moved in, the faucets began leaking. We have to disassemble the faucets every six months and replace the washers, which are challenging to find at local stores. We finally have a supplier for the washers, but it's a tremendous hassle to have to take your shower apart twice a year because the washers wear out so quickly. My wife's father is a plumber and says it's a design flaw -- the metal parts wear out the washers quickly. It's shocking that this cost $600. It seems like a $250 system, tops. Look elsewhere and save your money if you value your time."
5,Great Movie,Stan Lee has out did himself this movie is awesome and so is the character and story. i love this movie and i love stan lee one of the greatest comic book writer of our time
2,Condsnore,I was lucky that this was on cable when I decided to watch it. I would have been upset if had wasted the money to even rent this. I sat through the whole toon hoping for it to pick up to no avail. It was retardedly stereotypical and the plot holes seemed large enough to drive a truck through. I am hispanic and I found this to be more of an insult than a credit. I really think that it deserves one star but I'll cut it some slack...even though it sucked so bad.
2,Too Elementary,"I bought this book with the hopes of using it with my 8th grade class. After analyzing the lessons, I discovered that many if not all were too elementary for use with that age level. The cover suggests it can be used with grades 4-8, but I can't really see it working in grades 7 or 8."
5,for grandbaby,"He loves playing with this, kept him busy and help attention, also loved the airplane by fisher price too, thank you"
1,NETGEAR VPN05L ProSafe VPN Client Software,"We purchased a Netgear FVS114 VPN Firewall and VPN Client package (VPN05L) from CDW on 25 Jan 2008. We are told by Netgear Tech Support that the BIOS was changed in the device and it is no longer ""stable"". The previous BIOS version is no longer available. They are unable to resolve the problem (netgear tech support case: 6614329).I used to consider NETGEAR to be a quality vendor, but their failure to do any testing prior to replacing a firmware version demostrates a total lack of quality control and has lowered them to ""also ran"" status. We are very disapointed in Netgear's responce and their lack of concern with their products. Perhaps they will get this package working in the future but at this time (6 March 2008) it does not work."
1,Not for Windows 7,"If you are using Windows 7 (or planning on upgrading to Windows 7), this software is not going to work for you. This is old software (as others have noted). This software is VPN05L. For Windows 7 you need to buy the newer software VPNG05L. Fortunately, Amazon's return policy is very good so this didn't turn into an expensive mistake. However, Amazon should update the description so that other people don't fall into the same trap."
1,"Look elsewhere, unless you need a new hobby","Amazon did a fine job of distributing this product, but sadly, the product and the support is a mess. I have very good IT support personnel who have spent far too many hours trying to manage this software and its associated hardware. Netgear's customer support, if you find a CS staff member who doesn't elect to hang up on you, seems generally unaware that they market a software product at all, let alone this specific product. Anticipate the level of support you could provide under those circumstances and act accordingly."
1,Not what I expected,"This software was not what I expected. It was an old version and could not be used with Windows 7. However, Amazon was terrific and they refunded my money ASAP. Be sure this is what you need/want before you buy it."
3,What a difference,"Although I find the food combining aspect of her program a little difficult and I do not follow, I found great results eating organic poultry and dumping the dairy. I no longer have that sick sluggish feeling I usually have after consuming pizza and ice cream. It really is like sludge for our bodies. It also simply makes me feel good not to be partaking in the very sad dairy industry (if you MUST have dairy, please go organic). I have lost a couple of pounds in only one week, and my face is much less puffy! I used to follow South Beach, but really it just made me nauseous, and relied too much on artifical sweeteners and dairy. I lost a few pounds but simply didn't feel well. I wanted to find something with the same principles but took it a step further. Thanks Marilu!"
5,If you're ready for A CHANGE this book's for you!,"My wife and I started about a month ago and feel great. Now we find ourselves reading labels and realize what we were putting in our bodies. I've been on the Atkin's Diet and lost 25 lbs but found it hard to do without carbs for the long term. We find it easy to plan meals and find most of what we need in the health food section of our local supermarket. Even in our small town of 1,500 they sell soy cheese!"
3,decent information,"a typical pro vegetarian book. She really doesn't have the credentials to write a bunch of this stuff but then again, as I read the book, I could swear she got ALOT of the stuff from Stop the Insanity (including Susan Powters personal jokes) and also Fit for Life (Marilyn and Harvey Diamond) ITS JUST OTHER BOOKS IN HER OWN WORDS."
4,"Difficult at first, but AMAZING results later!!!","I met a woman in one of my classes who was on the Marilu plan. She was a constant ball of energy and man was she fit. I am 21 years old and I don't look near as good as her 31 year old lithe body.She and I talked and she let me borrow the book. WOW! I love it. It is a little, uh, strict. But, if you love vegetables and feeling great, this is definitely the plan for you. To the woman who said ""no protein with a starch meant no sandwiches. . ."" GET REAL!! There a thousand combinations of vegetable sandwiches you can do, and feel much better after eating them. I LOVE MY NEW ""MAKE-OVER!! 14 lbs of loss and still going!"
2,The scientific evidence is lacking in this self-help book,"While Marilu's book offers fairly good advice on healthy eating and living habits, I found the explanations to be greatly lacking any sound scientific rationale. The author over-simplified the subject matter for my taste. This is not for someone with an analytical mind or with any kind of interest in nutritional science. It is a puff piece."
3,This book can offers a health and attitude makeover.,"When I received my book I began by reading the chapter on food combining. I then went on to the recipe and pantry stocking sections. These sections are very doable. Later I completed skipped over chapters. I've been following the program for three weeks, feel very energetic and have not missed any of the fat, sugar ,salt, or dairy that I've eliminated from my eating habits. I'm still working on the caffeine."
2,Self Appointed Health Authority,Why buy a health book written by an actress? All her information has been gotten second hand and therefore not reliable. I enjoyed her before and after pictures so she does have a personal success story but that's about it. Buy something written by an authority on health. The book seemed to have the reliability of an infomercial. I'd skip this read!
2,Too difficult to follow,"Again, another celebrity with more money than God telling us what we should and shouldn't eat. This plan is NOT for the frugal. To buy soy products instead of dairy, be prepared to fork out twice the money. And food combining? Come on! Maybe if we all had personal chefs like Marilu we would have the time for that. One of her ideas was not eating starch with a protein. I gave it up, becuase that would mean giving up any and every type of sandwich!"
1,oh please!,"i love marilu henner to death ,but please! no caffeine, no dairy, no meat, no sugar, no white flour, what the heck does this woman eat? i am shocked to see this book received so many stars! i dont see how anyone could live on this diet, or even find the ingredients she suggests you use. this was insane, i have read them all and this was the worse!"
3,I already know what NOT to eat!,"I like Marilu's enthusiasm and writing style, but do I really need another book telling me to eliminate dairy, sugar, meat, caffeine, & white flour and to eat lots of fruits and vegetables? If I could do that, I wouldn't have a weight problem. She spends way to much time trying to persuade you to give up the bad stuff without really telling you what you're supposed to do instead. There are no sample eating plans, and the recipes are from her favorite vegetarian restaurant! I'm supposed to make this stuff at home? The food even looks bad in the pictures, by the way. I'd sure like to eat like Marilu does, but after reading her book, I'm still not sure how to get there."
5,10 steps to your B.E.S.T. BODY,An excellent book! Finally something that I can relate to and change my life forever.
4,How About A Follow-up Book of Eating Plans and Recipes?,"It was a most enjoyable read. My only problem is that the book doesn't give any sample eating plans. Something simple to follow. I would have liked to have seen recipes that we can make at home for our families not just fancy ones from a restaraunt. Though the ideas in the book aren't new, Marilu has succeeded in bringing them to light and this is extremely important because of the way Americans are eating. Maybe we will see and follow-up book with meal plans and recipes next? All the best, Marilu..."
2,Skip this one but buy the 30-day Total Health Makeover,"The first of Marilu's books, this one is padded with mumbo-jumbo and pseudo-science. The following book - 30-Day Total Health Makeover - repeats the truly essential information and provides a useful plan for a healthy diet. The recipes are tasty and healthful, and put you on track for both weight loss and a better diet without added sugar, red meat and dairy. Plus, because it contains both protein and carbs, the plan does not leave you famished. Head straight for the second book and when you're through the 30 days, get the Healthy Life Kitchen for more recipes."
5,This book changed my life!,"This is an awesome book; I highly reccommend it. Unfortunately, if you don't live in California, cheap, fresh, organic produce will be expensive and pretty hard to find. Otherwise, her suggestions on food combining and living dairy-free are wonderful (although if you read them, you may never want to drink cow's milk again). Trash The Zone and try this book. Her writing is refreshing and engaging, and having tried a million books about the same thing, Marilu's is the only one I would reccommend to someone seriously trying to change their eating habits."
5,This book is a must read!,"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover introduced me to some new ideas about how my digestive system works, and why calves can digest cows milk but I cannot. If only I had known this as a child, it would have saved me years of discomfort. She talks about smart carbs, and how they're good for us - yeah, I love my carbs! And fruit - what a natural cleansing way to start the day, I got my fruit again!After I read her book I logged onto her Message Boards at Marilu.com and was amazed at the support I found there. And then I discovered her 30-day Total Health Makeover, packed full or recipes and menus for a whole 30 days to show us just how easy it is to eat this way.I LOVE the Total Health Makeover! I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get healthy!"
5,Total Health Makeover,This is an excellent book. Easy to read and motivates you. My mother in law and sister in law are following it and are very happy with the results.
4,"Great, general introduction to fundamental food truths","Rather than echo what the 21 people ahead of me have already said, I would just like to add that the recipe section is very disappointing. The recipes are not consistent with her food combining instructions and contain ingredients that are not available in all parts of the country! I agree with the reader who encouraged Marilu to develop a cookbook that can help those of us with good intentions avoid getting sucked back into the protein/starch combinations surrounding us! (For those readers who'd like recipes, ""Fit for Life"" has some great ones that adhere to food combining principles!)"
5,The First of the Wrightsville mysteries,"In the first of the Wrightsville mysteries, Ellery seeks the peace and quiet of a small town for his writing, but soon becomes involved in the affairs of the Wright family. When newlyweds Jim and Nora Haight find themselves unwilling hosts to Jim's sister Rosemary, it is only a matter of time until Nora begins to suffer from sudden attacks of illness. However, it is Rosemary who dies on New Year's Eve of arsenic poisoning. What appears to be a straightforward murder case against Jim turns out to be anything but. There are plenty of romantic twists to the satisfying plot."
3,Audio MCAT Prep,"This is a good tool for people that have a good working knowledge of the material and if you are good with working on their own. If you prefer in-room learning or if you are a visual learner, or if you need the topics a little slower or more simplified, this is not going to help you much.They try to keep it entertaining, but with a kind of '80s humor, so kind of hard to follow.So kind of weird and doesn't help much with focusing.They seem to know their book, so they just kind of skip through stuff and more less read out of the book, but they do skip some stuff, and get some stuff from other sources, so can also be confusing.If it works for you, try it.I think there is a grace period for refunds.I'd look for a cheap seller and go with that."
3,Listen to these if you have a lot of extra time in the car.,"MCAT Audio Osmosis is not bad, but is not entirely good either. The CDs were helpful for review in a general way. I mostly used the CDs to find the topics which I found confusing. Instead of listening over and over again to the parts I really didn't understand, I found it more useful to review those areas from the Exam Krackers review notes (which are much, much better). As well there are way too many distractions throughout the CDs (they are only funny the first time)."
2,Comedy is very distracting,"I bought this after reading another reviewer complain about how incredibly distracting their poor attmept at mixing some comedy in with the MCAT information was... I bought anyway thinking ""how distracting could it actually be?"" Well... the sound effects that are added in for I guess a comedic slant and the ""dumb guy / smart guy"" way of presenting the material is sooooo distracting I can't stand to even listen to the CDs. It is horrible - what's worse is that this would be a good study review if these guys would lay off these sound effects and poor attempts at jokes that have nothing to do with learning or reviewing the material."
2,Way too much information! Not professionally done,"I took the MCAT and had the opportunity to listen to this series. I was not impressed with the manner in which they narrated the information or the cost. Also, it was way too much information to be high yield. I would say this was not worth my money and would just prefer to take a course."
1,Very disappointed,"I waited exactly 3 weeks to get my purchase. When I did receive it, it was broken and missing discs. I have tried to contact the seller without any response. I am very disappointed with my order and with amazon for not getting back to me quickly about the terrible order."
3,good as a supplement to studying,"These lectures are a good review for the MCAT, but if they did away with the corny jokes and cheap annoying sound effects, they could be even better. I think the idea of excessively trying to entertain listerners while teaching them MCAT material is overdone. The frequent jokes and sound effects are really unnecessary and only serve to throw off one's concentration while listening. Otherwise I would give these audio CDs 5 stars. I do give the authors credit for the tremendous effort they have put into making these CDs. I think Jordan and John should make a DVD MCAT lecture series where students can learn MCAT material at their own pace."
3,It was alright.,"It was obvious that it was recorded several years ago and hasn't been updated in a while. It was okay, I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying it as the information is useful and presented in a simple format. But it's a little expensive and I'm not sure it helped me much other than offering audio to the examkrackers books I was reading. The books seemed to be a little more up to date than the cd's and I would recommend these books over the Kaplan ones. Good luck on the MCAT!"
5,Worked for me.,"If you are so sensitive that these tasteless jokes bother you that much......you are not going to make it in medical school. Lighten up people.Yeah the jokes are bad, but the material is good.I took Gen Chem and Bio over 15 years ago, returned to school to gain pre-reqs for med school by taking Org and Physics. These CDs and the Examkrackers book set are all I studied for those long-forgotten subjects. Excellent, to-the-point format gave me exactly what I needed to know on each section, refreshed my memory with good visuals and the audio topped it off. As I am more of a visual learner, I was really surprised how much the audio helped.Worked for me as I am busy packing to enter Medical School in my first choice school for Fall, 05 matriculation.Good luck to all."
5,First rate vocals,"If you like a cappella music, you should like this--even if you're not a gospel music fan. Even my husband, who is a music snob and hates most of my a cappella CDs because of their simplistic harmonies or rhythms, likes this--he thinks the harmonies and rhythms are appropriately complex. However, it is still very pleasant to listen to."
4,Bit hard to judge veracity ... but seems a lifesaver!,"It is a bit hard to rate this book, since I have no expert knowledge as to its veracity or not, and that is really the crux of this book. The advice sounds true, but I don't know for sure ... do any of us? (Remember 'Duck and Cover'?) I would recommend that most every American who lives and/or works in a likely target (e.g. any large-sized metropolitan city) read what this book says, though, and commit it to memory. This is one of those books that, having read free online (Rand makes it available online free at http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1731/), I am going to also purchase, mostly for the reference card available at the end. As someone who spends 8-10 hours per day in the nation's second largest major metropolitan center (Chicago), I would rather have this information handy in card form should the worst ever happen. Call me paranoid, but I'd rather have it and not need it, rather than needing it and not having it ..."
2,All Costume and No Drama,"This is a big-budget Costume Drama that is All Costume and No Drama. It wastes very good actors (Ed Harris, Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins) on a very thin script and very lavish production-values. There is hardly any suspense, and it's a pity to see actors try so hard with so little to work with. The high point is seeing how much Bob Hoskins looks like Kruschev. We used to hear that the personal is political; this movie takes the opposite position, that all politics is merely personal. Pretty ham-handed and silly; and you can see the actors squirming to deliver their lines. Propagandistic and tiresome; but visually beautiful."
5,Enemy at the Gates Review,"I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It takes place in 1942 in Russia and the Nazis are attacking Stalingrad. Jude Law is a member of the resistance and becomes a hero, and the Germans send a guy (Ed Harris) to stop him. They are both top snipers and the sniper war is on. They both have to out-think the other, and it goes on from there. This movie is a suspenseful thriller you will want to watch over and over. I have had friends over to watch it and they have called me back later to ask what the name was so they could order it for themselves so they could watch it again at home. This movie is a must-see and a must-have movie. I can't recommend it enough. It is a GREAT movie!*****!"
5,A good cat and mouse game,"Ed Harris (the Nazi) and Jude Law (the Russian) are matched against each other as World War II snipers serving their country. Joseph Fiennes is also good in a pivotal role as is Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushchev and Rachel Weisz as a strong female character (who just wants to throw herself on Vasseil's just becasue he famous of being a great sniper) any typical stupid woman. This movie is a compelling look at the constantly needed reminder that simply, war is terrible and the innocent victims that suffer is even more tragic."
2,Two stars for sharp shooting only,"Just another Hollywood love story wrapped in pseudo-Russian atmosphere.The actors have nothing in common with Russians and Russian history. A big laugh for anyone familiar with reality!The screenplay is written with little respect for the nation that won the battle of Stalingrad and saved Europe from Nazi Germany.If you are looking for entertainment - go ahead and see the movie, if you want to find out more about WWII and Russia - forget about this film..."
3,"Great beginning, the rest is decent.","Enemy at the Gates opens with an impressive battle sequence that unleashes the horrors of war and displays just how furious and devastating the battle of Stalingrad was. After that harrowing set piece, the movie settles down to a cat-and-mouse game between two legendary snipers (Jude Law vs. Ed Harris). Such moments are tense, but too much of the film is ineffective, such as the romance between Law and Rachel Weisz, the incredibly derivative musical score (the usually great James Horner, ripping off his own work such as The Perfect Storm and Braveheart, as well as from Schindler's List), the predictable plot, and rushed pacing and editing. Still recommended for war film fans."
3,A miss...,"The Eastern front is a vast source of untold stories, and this flick falls short of delivering some goods.No euro quality, atmosfere, but a mediocre ""modern"" action movie,with an incomplete story.Ryan is 20 times a better show. You can see that Spielberg puts to the screen exactly what his story needs,(and more), and Mr Annaud fails.Still, a good effort!..."
1,Falsification,"Ordinary hollywood-""historical"" movie that like any other hollywood movies has nothing to do with the reality. It depicts neither the character, nor the spirit, nor the soul, nor the mindset of the people. Forget the real events and characters. It is about an imaginary people invented by hollywood.This pure fantasy-fiction farce presents a medley, in one bowl, of situations taken from different places and periods of the war, an ignorant-tourist gift set like balalaika, nesting doll, bottles of vodka (glass bottles in the trenches?), and, of course, typical western fare of ""Russian"" ""cannon fodder for the officers"". Also, the Russians are to blame themselves for the massacre in the territories occupied by the Nazis and the loss of soldiers on the front.This continued hollywood trip along the path of rewriting the history of the war more than fifty years after its end is an insult. It is not about my grandparents who fought in the war since the first day of it."
2,"Starts great, goes wrong","I suppose I'm churlish for not liking this movie. Not having seen ads or reviews and not having read the book, I was misled by the opening sequences into thinking that this was a movie about the battle of Stalingrad. The opening sequences are very effective and impressively nightmarish in showing that ""war is hell,"" a message one can't hear too often.Then it all goes dreadfully wrong, as the viewer is expected to be interested in a farfetched cat-and-mouse game between two snipers. This is such small potatoes compared to the start of the movie that I turned it off in disgust. As with virtually all ""hit man"" movies, I quickly lose interest in ""who kills who?"" as the body count increases. But I guess if you liked Pulp Fiction, you may like this."
4,The good and the bad,"I thought this movie was great to watch and I definetly want to own it, But at times there were some unrealistic scenes. For example, there is a sex scene, which at that time would have never happened (especially during a war). I understand that for it to be a drama, hollywood probably has rules about adding things like that. The movie still had suspence though. Although it doesnt capture the true story of the sniper and the war in Russia, It does give a rough look to audiences who are not up on their history. In other words, if you want the true story look it up in a book or on the history channel and one will notice that the movie is slightly off. All in all, I still enjoyed this movie. When my boyfriend took me to see it I thought it would be a guy movie, but it turned out to be pretty good. I think everyone should see it at least once."
1,Inaccurate and insulting WARNING: SPOILERS,"This movie is about as accurate as a blind man firing a zip gun. It deviates about as far as you can get from the truth and still be talkng about the same war, much less front. Almost every aspect of this movie is completely wrong. I would list them all except I would exceed the 1,000 words limit. But one very sore point: the bastardization of the ending. The girl steps on a land mine and dies from organ failure in real life. Not this crap ending of the movie. ARGH! If you want a reasonably accurate version of this story, go and buy War of the Rats. It's a book. You read it. Actually that book was what made me so excited when I heard this movie was coming out. Afterwards I just wanted to maul the director with a wrench."
1,simply a bad movie overall,what is this movie about?-A history movie? but it lacks of the truth of history.-A love story? but it lacks of characters. The characters are too simple.What it's amusing is the Hollywood style bluffing.
4,good movie,"I wanted to get this movie because I like sniping, and I like the sniper rifles they use in the movie. I think if you like world war 2, you definitely should have this movie. Very entertaining, with a good plot."
4,A Great Movie,"This is a movie about a hero who rises at the Battle of Stalingrad to give hope to the Soviets in a war that was not going very well for the Red Army.Detractors from this movie tend to fall into two categories. The first are those who wanted to see a different type of movie. They want to see a movie about the total battle. I'd like to see a ""Longest Day"" type movie on the Battle of Stalingrad. But that's a different typeof movie.The other are those who have no knowledge of history. Those think the movie was some sort of spoof. When the command came down from Stalin that the Red Army was to give no more ground to the Nazis, it was carried out with ruthlessness if necessary.It's a good movie."
2,Sound didn't work so well,Sound kept going in and out had to restart my system 3 times to get it to work. Never had a problem with other instant movie networks
2,Painfully Average War Film,"Despite a truly gifted cast, this film lacks the slightest hint of dramatic tension. I watched this film wondering how Jean-Jaques Annaud keeps getting backers for his projects. From the utterly boring ""Seven Years in Tibet"" to this overblown piece of junk he proves over and over that he is a sub-par filmaker who cannot sustain suspense and has a hard time with character development. Although technically proficient, the film was not the least bit compelling and the characters motives are as blurry as a stained glass. Any director who can make Ed Harris seem so boring and conventional, should be thrown out of the guild for crimes against competent actors."
2,Meh. Another hollywood war movie.,"There is little positive to say about this movie. It does show a different front of world war II, which is always an interesting diversion from the typical 'Mericans vs. Nazi or Japanese plot. Also, choosing to focus on a sniper other than a generic soldier was a cool concept. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.Actors who are suppose to be Russian or German don't speak their respective language, AND speak in English with British/American accents. Rough transition between scenes and plot points left me wondering ""wait, did I miss something?"". Shallow characters that make me feel indifferent whether they lived or died. A stupid, stupid love triangle that took focus away from the overall plot and served as a cue for over dramatic, generic score. Predictable battles, predictable ending, overall lame."
3,Graphic,"Be forewarned. This movie is about snipers. Snipers go for headshots. You do the math.Very well done, with a portrayal of Kruschev sent to the city by Stalin to ""fix"" things. Stalingrad landmarks are well-portrayed in the film. The actors were good, but in some cases I think they were in miscast."
4,WWII Stalingrad,An interesting flick. Showing a glimpse of the horrors of WWII. Not a good film for children or those with weak stomachs. The nudity scene was unneccessary.The portion of the film devoted to Kruchev shows just how much of a dispical man he was. A truly evil man who did take the life's of hundreds of thousand people to gain power.This film gives one a feeling of what Stalingrad must have been like during the fighting from more of the Russian point of view.
4,Good Movie,"This was purchased as a gift. Although I had seen this movie before, I thought that Ed Harris should have at least attempted to speak with an accent."
3,It's a movie about people... only using war as background!,"It's a movie about people using war as the background. It's a good suspense and entertaining movie. However, it contains a typical theme in many Hollywood-style war movies that the effort of one hero destroyed an entire German army. But, the collapse of German troops at Stalingrad couldn't be only caused by a single Russian sniper. There are many other factors to it. Please read and study the history or the original book..."
3,Could have been better.,"Enemy at the Gates will give you a feeling for what the people of Stalingrad suffered through during the Nazi seige. The battle scenes are great. The cinematography is wonderful. The story line is a bit weak, but kind of interesting.The problem with the movie is that it does not follow the true story of Vassili Zaitsev. Agreed, this is a movie and the producers have the right to use artistic license, BUT, the true story of Zaitsev is even more fascinating than the movie portrays.I would encourage the viewer to explore the history of Zaitsev and the female in the movie, Tania Chernova. I assure you, it will amaze you! For instance, in real life Chernova was an American, a New Yorker of Russian descent (something you will not get from the movie).So, thumbs up for a good display of what war was like in Stalingrad and thumbs down for substituting a make believe story line for a true one that is simply astounding."
4,"Overall, a very good film","I enjoyed this one, but it slightly disappointed me at the same time. I hoped for a realistic portrayal of the siege of Stalingrad, but the focus narrows onto a few main characters. The love triangle was a pretty trite and dull way to enhance the plot, probably put in to broaden the appeal of the film. Rachel Weisz is hot, but she is either always miscast or is just an irritating, weak actress. The portrayal of Nikita Khruschev is unconvincing, to put it mildly. Apart from these negatives however, it is an enthralling film. The sniper battles are both realistic and suspenseful. Ed Harris (the german) and Jude Law both give great performances. The direction and cinematography are also very nice. If they put some more work on the plot and character development I would maybe have given it five stars."
2,Pace of Film is Destroyed,"This could have been an excellent film. It should have focused entirely on the cat and mouse tactics employed by the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Soviet Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), both snipers trying to bring the other out into the open. However, the film constantly shifts focus between the Soviet propaganda officer (Joseph Fiennes) and female Soviet soldier (Rachel Weisz) in a ridiculous love triangle. This totally destroys the pace of the film and detracts from its main subject. By the time of the denouement there is no emotion felt. The characters, the two protagonists, are never given any real depth to lend meaning to their actions and motivations. The only emotion felt, is delivered by James Horner's score during the scenes when the two men actually do confront each other. This film is an example of a lost opportunity."
2,"Too much propaganda, too little truth.","Some facts are taken from the real history, then exaggerated, distorted or falsified. Russians would have never won this one of the greatest battles in the world history if they were such idiots as they are shown in this movie. The only worthy episode in the film is the strange sexy scene between main characters. The principal actors play OK. Especially I liked Ed Harris."
2,"Enemy of ""Enemy at the Gates""","A good movie subject, but a poor movie. Should have skipped the love story and focused more on the battle. Seemed too upbeat at points for a war movie. Didn't let you get too involved in the story. Not suspensfull enough for a story of two snipers fighting each other."
1,At least they got the city right.,"unfortunately i had to give it one star, it deserves none. not since the movie "" battle of the bulge "" have i seen a film miss it's claim "" the true story "" so badly. the constant time-outs for the rest of the men in stalingrad when the snipers were hunting, seeking out their trophies, or as in the end, out in the open where they would have been cut down by any one of the hundreds, thousands, etc. of others there. good idea to tell the story of stalingrad , but at least come close to the truth. another story that fans of true history should beg speilberg and hanks to do. they seem to have gotten their last effort right( band of brothers ). the bulge would be a good one for them too."
2,Slow typical Russian pain and suffering,"Sorry, I read the high ratings but the movie lacked interest, action and empathy. It was slow boring and lacked the spark that made you want to see what was coming up next. How can so many people be wrong, it must be me. I suggest you RENT BUT DON'T BUY"
2,How about realism?,"I feel awkward stating this, but I honestly found no realism in the movie Enemy at the Gates. Sure, this was a great movie for passing the time, great action, fine acting, and so forth. The truth is the whole plotline is false, not that they ever truly claim it to be based on a true story. He is one soldier, one of millions in Soviet army. They sadly idolize Zaitsev as the hero of Soviet. The truth was, there would be little knowledge of him around Soviet Union at the time. Maybe the area sure, but the truth was the movie acted as if he would turn the war around."
3,Love and Bullets,"Wow! Who could have guessed that plucky little Vassili would get the drop on Hitler's top gun, spork the local hottie, make headlines, win medals, and even get a hug from Kruschev? Oh yeah, all the shots and explosions are because it happened during the Battle of Stalingrad. I give it three because there is a great deal of fabulous eye candy."
2,Did I miss something here?,"I just saw this movie and read all the reviews. Was Koenig (played by Ed Harris) an American who defected to Germany? No one commented on his utter lack of any accent or effort to even make an accent up. Jude Law is an excellent actor, but hey, if youre such a highly trained actor where was your linguist coach too? I wasnt aware that Russians also had English accents. The movie itself (although hardly historically correct) wasnt too bad. Unfortunately, it was the director who ruined it. He should have insisted these actors try to use or get dialect coaching to bring more realism to it. I just couldnt bring myself to believe that I was watching a real German sniper going after a Russian one. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this is rediculous."
2,Chickflick alert,"Judging from the trailer, I thought this was going to be another film in the mould of Saving Private Ryan, except with the action taking place on the eastern front in Stalingrad. I should have known better. With heart-throb duo, Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes heading up the cast with their dreamy looks, Enemy at the Gates is not really war movie at all but a far-fetched, wafer-thin romantic ""chickflick"" with a few battle scenes thrown in to provide the historical setting. They shouldn't have bothered. I was bitterly disappointed. It starts promisingly enough but after about half an hour leaves you fumbling for the vom bucket. I hope Pearl Harbour isn't as bad as this, which is the kind of thing that makes you want to watch the entire Sam Pekinpah back-catalogue in one sitting."
4,Alarming wartime enactment,"Enemy at the Gates contained some of the most authentic and horrific wartime footage since Spielberg's masterpiece, ""Saving Private Ryan"". The attack by Nazi fighter planes on Russian soldiers crossing the Volga river by boat was particularly disturbing in it's effectiveness. The wartime settings depicting war time Stalingrad was first rate.The story revolves around the pitting of the top Nazi sniper, played by Ed Harris against the propagandized top Soviet sniper played by Jude Law. The battle of wits between the 2 is played out very nicely. There is also a love triangle played out between Law, Soviet political officer Joseph Fiennes (excellent as usual) and Soviet soldier Rachel Weisz. This proves to be too syrupy for my own taste.As is usual with contemporary films, this one runs about 20 minutes too long. Incidently, Bob Hoskins is chillingly effective as Nikita Khruschev."
4,Great War film !,"This movie is often compared to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and it is almost as good. The story is about a Russian Sniper who killed a lot of German officers during the siege of Stalingrad. The Nazi sent its own top sniper from Berlin to counter the Russian sniper. The Russian sniper played here by Jude Law and the German sniper played by Ed Harris. Performances are quite good and the movie is beautifully shot by director Jean-Jacques Annaud. Unfortunately the DVD sound quality is nowhere near the sound quality of Saving Private Ryan. If you watch this after watching Saving private Ryan DVD, you will be disappointed by the sound quality. The picture transfer itself is very good. If you like War movies, this movie certainly won't disappoint you."
4,Enemy at the Gates,This a gritty well acted and directed down in the mud and guts story set in WWII. Follow the footsteps of a lowly soldier rising up to become his countries finest sniper. I love this movie It's now in my collection
4,"Entertaining, Enlightening and Worth the Watch","Enemy at the Gates tells the story of Vasilly Zeitzev during a week or so of the Battle of Stalingrad. In reading the other reviews, I would have to say that they tend to be dead on - the movie jumps from frenzied war scenes filled with violence to the one on one cat and mouse game played between the two snipers - Zeitzev and Koening - where it seems the war and time stands still. The love triangle and the over the top portrayal of Nikita Kruschev are probaby the biggest detractions from the story line, but they also provide enough entertainment value as to not pull too much from the main story line. If you have interest in the Second World War, this story will intice you - it is one of the very few movies made about the Eastern Front, and the equipment, cinematography and setting are first rate. Worth watching."
5,"Fast Shipping, Product arrived as described","The DVD arrived in good time, and the quality of the product was just as described. It was in good condition. I was very satisfied with this purchase."
3,Read 'War of the Rats' instead...,"This is a very average war movie. The plot is extremely thin and the characters not explained well enough.If you like the genre, read 'War of the Rats' instead."
4,At the Gates,I have seen this before and enjoyed it just as much the seond time around. Love the story and the casting. it would be interesting however to hear real Russian and German language used.
5,Enemy at the gates,This is a really good movie good price and it shipped fast.great form of history and it is action packed
3,"War Movie, but just missing a certain pfiff","I really was expecting more than I got, as this was one of the first European large productions...Well to make it short, I enjoyed the story of Zaitsiev, the noble sniper (check the book Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor), being made in to a movie. Snipers sure played a part in destroying the German morale in Stalingrad, but that is not of discussion here.On the down side are the language (everyone has an King's English accent) no Russian, absolutely debatable portrait of the Soviet Union (Ideological battle in a movie) and just taking in famous names does not make it special..."
3,Not a great war movie,"I long waited to watch this film. Since Saving Private Ryan, I'm waiting to see a REALLY GOOD movie. Saving Private Ryan is the pinacle of the cinema. With Enemy At The Gates I thought I would delete that blank. And I was very disappointed. After the first 15 minutes it gets really boring. Don't need to mention that the actors choice couldn't be more wrong. Joseph Fiennes is a fine actor, but Jude Law is much less than a mediocre actor, big time screw up. You couldn't ever tell when he's happy or when he's unhappy. By the way, we already saw this in Artificial Inteligence and Mr. Rippley. Jude Law is one of the worst things ever appeared in Hollywood. Everything in this movie is a big foul up. There's no such thing as sequence in this movie. Everything happens all of a sudden, but not in the good way.Three stars are only because of the realistic scenario and shooting."
2,A let down,"I waited for this movie to come out when I first heard about it, and even bought the book. The movie turned out to be mostly fluff. Effeminate characters and a fabricated love story subplot pretty much ruined it for me."
5,"The Russian ""experience"" of WWII....","This is a great movie. I would venture to say that this is the Russian ""experience"" of WWII. The cinematography and special effects are commendable. My favorite scene is when Vasily gets to the battlefront... amazing takes of the German attacks, specially the ""Stukas"" diving in."
4,Enemy at the Gates,"Enemy at the Gates is an excellent movie. It is far from an action movie - more like a drama with guns, an awesome sniper movie. Never before have I seen into the mind of a sniper in a movie as in depth as I did in this movie. The beginning of the movie (going into war) was more shocking to me than the opening of Saving Private Ryan. Two thumbs up to Rachel Weisz and Jude Law!"
2,Russians with British accents?,"I fell for the hype and went out to see this movie a few weeks ago. What bugs me the most is that every time this movie is mentioned saving private ryan is as well. It is by no means comparable to saving private ryan. The film is often slow and boring, after the opening few scenes the rest of film was a cat and mouse game between two snipers. Another problem with the film that made it hard to get excited about is the fact the main characters are supposed to be Russian's, but they speak with English accents. Not that the acting was bad I just couldn't get past the accents."

5,"vondaful, darling, vondaful!",I really liked this movie. Jude law was spectacular- as well as all the other actors. The authenticity of the story made the movie. I highly recommend it
2,Not much here,"Besides a great cast, excellent special effects, and a tremendous amount of history to draw upon, this fictitious love story set in the calamity that was the Battle of Stalingrad comes across as rather weak. Read Antony Beevor's book ""Stalingrad, the fateful siege"" instead."
5,2nd best WW2 movie,"Enemy at the Gates opens with a great battle scene, not as good as the one in Saving Private Ryan, but it still blows you away. This would be my second fave WW2 movie after Saving Private Ryan. One thing interesting is that it's an American made movie, but has no American characters. I saw this in theaters when it first came out, and I'm contemplating whether to buy on DVD."
2,"The Enemy at this Gate is ""Hollywood""","The opening battle scene is very well done and throughout the movie there are some very interesting scenes but, as with so many movies, its potential was not realized to make the movie more inviting to as wide an audience base as possible. There was too much emphasis placed on the ""love interest"" part of the story and not enough on the actual battle itself. The duel between the snipers was good but because we have to sit through all the ""love interest"" parts the duel becomes overly long and towards the end you just want one of them to get shot so it will be over. Finally, when we do get to the climax of the duel it is heavily dipped in Hollywood instead of ending it the way it is written in the histories.As with so many war movies the director, even if the intention is to honor those who fought and died, seem to be saying,""Thanks for all your sacrifice, but wouldn't it have been better and more exciting if it had happened this way?"""
5,A very nice movie about World War II in Russia,"This movie is a remake of Ozerov's Angels of Death (highly recommended, available only in original version, so you have to understand Russian).For Westerners trying to make a ""Russian movie"", this is a great success. Beautiful acting, although I did not like Khruschev (he looked different and was not vicious as portrayed by Hoskins)."
5,Enemy at the gates is best!,"I think that Enemy at the Gates is the greatest movie ever! I love it so much, and I dream about it every night. It is a movie you don't forget, because it's the best! The actors are so good, and the background is great, and the story is so hilarious and beautiful and great!!!! I love the movie, and I can see it on and on again!/Nea"
3,Grand but dull movie,"This movie could have been a great war epic if more attention had been given to the storyline. The sets and the war sequences are grand and one of the best in the recent times. The plot is bad and sometimes this movie is on the verge of called ""boring"". Jude Law could have been more expressive. If you watch this alone, you'll sleep."
1,This was really awful,"Besides the fact that it was boring and the story was not compelling, it was impossible to get past the actors' very British accents-you just cannot believe these people are Russian. This fact alone destroys this movie completely. Don't waste your time or money, rent Private Ryan instead."
1,Dreadful.,"I had high hopes for this because I usually love Jude Law movies. This is just one long, drawn-out, boring, one-dimensional war movie. Some nice score, some cool sound effects for your home theatre system, but that's about it."
1,WHATS WITH THIS LOVE TRIANGLE CRAP!!!,"This film as a weak plot and a realy stupid love circle which goes way of the actual events that took place a the Battle for Stanlingrad all and all its realy stupid.But there is one thing I want to add the historical acurse of the battle is very close to how thing realy happen on the eastern front, so in that respect it is an ok film."
1,Enemy at the Gates (Region 2),The DVD is not formatted for American DVD players. Totally unuseable and a waste of money. Not able to find the address of the shipper to return. Very unsatisfied.
3,It's a nice try at something different.,"I'm glad that filmmakers considered doing something different for a change. By different I mean something other than an invincible American shooting Germans or Japanese (I.E. Windtalkers). This movie is extremely depressing. We are introduced to a new character several times, who is killed as soon as we figure out what their name is, which leaves the audience frustrated. I'd like to see a WWII movie from the German perspective for once. The only war movies I know of that are of the Germans perspective are WWI movies. So, come on writers/directors, make something new."
4,Enemy at the Gates,"Very powerful movie I've always enjoyed and now, my daughter is doing a report on the same. Thank goodness for continued excellent movie making !!! This is a movie that will certainly hold your attention and focuses on other aspects that certainly do occur during any war. Worth watching."
