2,Beware- item is only for one,"I ordered this item, because the picture showed three puzzles. I thought the penny in the picture was to show scale-not which single puzzle was being sold alone. I would have liked to know that before receiving the single puzzle in the mail."
4,Preparing Brady for Baby's Arrival,"This title is included in the series ""I Can Understand"" published by Standard Publishing. The books are written and illustrated for children, ages 3 - 7 years old.This book is a first person story told by a child in a conversational style. The book shows various comparisons of the Big Brother and the New Baby that is to arrive. Much of the narration centers on conversations with the grandmother.This is an excellent book to help prepare the child for a baby's birth, getting ready for the baby, helping with the baby, and encouraging the expression of feelings of the child. The activity pages and suggestions for parents further enhance the value of this delightful, beautifully illustrated book.It is a book you will want to read many times to your younger children as they await the arrival of a new baby sister or brother."
4,This Book Was Very Disturbing,"This book was very good, but it was also very disturbing. I personally didn't mind it much, but if you don't like violence and gore, I wouldn't recommend this book to you. However, if you think you can handle it, it is a great book and it would be worth your while to read it."
3,Sickening and sad.,The writing wasn't the best but still worth reading. Be warned it is not for the weak at heart. I can't help feeling bad for the son if he was raised this way. Very graphic and detailed story. Gave me shivers to think about what the children went through.
3,utility,This kit offers fewer cutting and shaping tools than I had expected. Sandpaper rings and disks outweigh the package.bem
2,Middle of the road,"I've been on a quest for some good LIVE Eric Burdon / Animals music for a long time. I listened to this album recently and had mixed feelings. The band was great, the first four songs are in the studio and are really good with the exception of Crawling King Snake which is ten plus very long minutes and could have been left off the album or at least cut in half. Now the live stuff - The arrangments are decent but they won't blow you away. Don't Bring Me Down, Boom Boom, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood are played well but I'm Crying just didn't get it.I've seen Eric Burdon and the Eye Band and the New Animals who turned out to be the same band. I'm not sure if that is who is backing Eric on this album, it sounds like the same crowd to me.If the energy that was put into the studio cuts carried over onto the live cuts I would have given it a higher rating. Eric's singing is quite good throughout the album though."
1,Pandora's picnic basket,"I've read 6 or 7 books on GMO's, pro and con. This book portends to be neutral in the beginning, but in fact it sets forth a pro GMO opinion. Sorry, I'm not convinced."
2,Lego Island 2,My mom is typing this for me. I am almost 6 and this game is way too complicated for me and my parents. There are very few on screen instructions and unlike 102 Dalmatians we just cannot seem to figure it out!! Definately not for the beginner!
3,"Too hard for kids, too boring for older kids",This game has no building with legoes!!! Some of the games were so difficult my husband would have to do it. The other problem was that you cannot play around in different levels until you got through each section. This was frustrating to my son. There were only a few things my son could do...
2,Worse Than the Original!!,"All talk, no play! It's either too hard or just rediculuos! Only the grafics were good."
2,Great Shears...for a while.,"I was very careful in selecting a pristine pair of shears from Home Depot, and the tool worked flawlessly for several months...Until yesterday when I was working out in my back yard, trimming back some salvia to encourage fresh growth. In mid-cut, I felt the tool jam. Examination of the blades showed that the cutting edges were deadheading against one another and had created a razor sharp burr of metal. At this point I stopped using the shears.Fiskars needs to improve their hedge shear design to resolve this jamming issue.If your Fiskars jam I recommend you call their warranty line at 1-800-500-4849. I did, and a new set of shears are being sent to me, free of charge. If you don't want to deal with Fiskars, and are handy with a grinder/sharpening tool, then you could try grinding out the burr yourself (or have a professional do it for you)."
1,Lasted only 10 minutes,I purchased these from home depot a week ago and started to use them before I even finished the job the blades got damaged and I can no longer close them. This is the worst quality shear I have ever seen DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!
5,Great purchase,This hedge trimmer worked great to trim up my pretty bushes in my back yard. It is so easy to use and the job goes really quick...which I love. Hubby even trimmed up a few branches from our trees and he was impressed how smooth it was. Once again great product by Fiskars!
1,Garbage,Didnt make it 10 minutes until the gear slipped and you cant fix. The only people rating this 5 stars must be trimming their hair because that's as thick an object it can cut.
5,Fiskar's are wrist-friendly,Inspite of having a tendonitis problem in my wrist I can easily use these pruning implements- I bought 3 sizes and love them all. The hedge trimmer works better and more easily than our electric pruning shears.They are the best!
1,DO NOT BUY,The blades are made of aluminum! ! Mine bent at the edge so that the blades hang on each other and the scissors won't close... after five cuts...! I own a pair of Fiskars loppers that have a titanium cutting blade and they are excellent but this thing is a dud.By the way I finnished the job with my 30 years old hedge trimmers that have never once been sharpened and have to be oiled every time I use them because they are rusted to the point of being siezed every year when I use them for the first time.
5,Well worth the price,"This tool may be pricier than other hedge shears, but it is well worth the extra money, especially if you do a lot of your own manual hedge-trimming. Because of the ""power gear"" feature, it requires very little effort to cut through even very thick hedge branches. I had used traditional ash-handled shears before, which I purchased for half the price of these, and I ended up giving that pair away once I started using the Fiskars. The comfortable design and the fact that the shears do most of the work for you make this a great item. I was so pleased with this Fiskars purchase that I went on to buy other Fiskars gardening tools, including the PowerGear Bypass Lopper, the PowerGear Pruner, and their telescoping pole trimmer."
1,Poor design,"These hedge shears have a rachet system that is suppose to increase the cutting force. Three times they jumped a tooth and I had to take them apart to realign everything, then after another 5 minutes of use they slipped again. If you truly are trimming a hedge and never try to cut anything substantial (like a quarter inch diameter) they might work for you. But to me they aren't worth the extra price of models with a less sophisticated design."
3,Lifetime Warranty but didn't last more than a few bushes,"We bought this product because we heard it was a solid company. I used it the day we got it, was clipping some bushes along our house and the blades bit into each other and rendered itself useless. It would not close beyond where the two blades gouged into each other. I filed it down so I could use it again but it does not cut the same. I am in the process of exercising the warranty.Other than that happening, it cut very well while it lasted, better than most any I have used in the past. I would buy it again because of the warranty and how it performs while in working order."
2,Audio Cable,"Worked great, cheap and effective. Although i had left it out in the sun for a few days and the rubber between the metal in the headphone jack melted and no is no longer functional. only problem."
2,Did not work with Android Phone MyTouch4G,"I bought this to use my phone for music and internet radio in the car (aftermarket Alpine radio).HTC MyTouch4g phone thinks it is a headset and the phone goes crazy, calling random people and skipping songs all over the place. I ended up buying a $10 cable at radio shack and it works fine with my phone.Its nice and cheap, but it didn't work for me."
2,Painful,This is a rather tedious exercise which only serves one purpose to allow Russell to write the regeneration story. And even then he contradicts everything we've been told right back to the New Adventures about this event. There are a couple of nice set pieces and some interesting things to say about continuity and the rehabilitation of Colin Baker's portrayal. But in the end it's a rather boring book.
4,"Who's is the voice ""ähhhhm""??","For a competition, i have to now, who's the voice in the beginning of the song: the voice which is groaning ""ähhmmmmm""? Please help me and write a mail at the following addresse. Thank you a lot of your help."
5,Very upbeat Jazzy number. Can't wait for the full CD.,"Surprisingly strong entry for this group. Very bright, upbeat Jazzy sound. No other work apparently available yet. I can't wait to hear more from this group. Zen-Zoom."
1,This song sucks! All she does is say a few things! I hate it,"I can't stand this song and all she is saying is that she likes someone. God, I you're gonna sing, make an actual song you stupid touch and go people!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Funky Expedition,"The only reason I bought this CD was for one song: Somethin' to Ride (Funky Expedition). I love this song. It was very popular back in the early 90's and then nobody really heard of the Conscious Daughters anymore. Most of the other songs are not really for me, but others might like them.If you liked Da Brat's 'Funkdafied' or other female rappers from the early 90's that have a melodical beat to their music you'll enjoy this song."
3,Crafted but more political than I care for,"When I read ""If On a Winter's Night a Traveler"" I was completely pulled in and engrossed by the creative, crafted nature of the story and of Calvino's abilities. So, years later, I picked up this book of short stories. Since ""Winters Night"" is really a collection of related short stories, I expected ,uch the same. UNfortunately, I didn't like it as much. This book represents a real cross-section of his work. I found that most of his political allegories were a little too heavy for me. What I found most interesting were the stories that focused on relationships. Mother to son, lover to lover, friend to friend. This is where I was most interested. Since I seem to prefer Calvino in certain types of fiction, this may not have been the best collection for me. If you are a fan of Calvino & are looking for a good overview, this book may be better for you."
5,cross and switch expansion pack,I am very pleased with the quality of the Thomas railway tracks. I really do believe there is a big difference in the generic track and the Thomas track. We needed extra track for my grandsons train table and I got it a least half the price from Amazon compared to the local stores.
5,A great book!,This is a great book to use in both graduate and undergraduate Ethnography courses. I've used it in my courses every year since it was released in 2000.
1,What about the non europeon and American cheeses,"I found this book quite informative when it came to the old and tested cheeses, however there are a lot of excellent cheeses which are beeing made in Australia and New Zealand which can easily compare to the tastes coming out of the US and europe.Except for this oversight I find this an excellent book"
1,"Fiskars 21"" bow saw","From reading the other reviews on Fiskar saw's I assumed that this saw was of reasonable quality and ""Made in Sweden."" It couldn't have been more from the truth. The Fiskar's saw was exactly like the Chinese made generic bow saw's sold at your chain hardware store for about $7.00, the only difference being that the Fiskars name had been added, right above ""Made in China"". In my opinion, the idea that this product is built to last a life time is laughable. Held together by flimsey rivits that, even though new, looked ready to fall out. When actually using this product, it felt as flimsey as it looked."
2,Very disappointed in Fiskars,"I picked this up because Fiskars normally makes high quality products and therefore is a respected brand, and also because it was very inexpensive. I expected high value from this saw. Instead I got the quality I'd expect from a no-name Chinese saw. The worst part, as others have mentioned, is the rivets. They seem delicate and flimsy, like they would break or fall out over time. I may replace the rivet that holds the blade with a bolt and wing nut. This one will get the most stress and I don't want it to break while I am out in the bush.I am actually embarrassed to use this cheap saw. Fiskars is normally a great brand and I love many of their other products. This one is low quality and I am highly disappointed in Fiskars."
4,"15"" To 30"" Pivoting LCD Mount",Pros:* Great Design* Supports a signifigant amount of weight* Great swivel radiusCons:* No tilt feature* I had to trim the edges of mine a little to fit my KDS LCD
3,Quaint quirks save lukewarm novel,"This novel is a pretty typical book-club-approved cozy mystery . The main plot, concerning bog-standard main character, the Lovely, Fair-Minded and A Little Plucky Young Woman Cordelia, becomes quickly obscured by more extraordinary, although not strictly relevant, events. bog standard main character, the Lovely, Fair-Minded and A Little Plucky Young Woman. The story's really about its population of everyday eccentrics, their bumbling follies, and the very funny turns of phrase used to describe them (much is made of a certain aerial daredevil of the fair sex and her ""attractive suit of tights""). This style is reminiscent of Garrison Keillor's novels and stories; and the men of what become the Moosepath League are literary descendants of Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat. This book wouldn't suffer from a slightly more burlesque treatment, but it's good fun nonetheless."
3,Silkk can do way better,"I have heard much better from all the No Limit Soldiers and mostly Silkk. It could have been better. There was only one good song and thats ""It ain't my fault 2""."
2,Good for a sophmore album.,"No limit is not my favorite rap music crew, but silk and mia got it locked. Silks latest one has some good tracks. This is the first time I listened to the whole of a no limit cd. Silks cd had at least 10 good songs. Seriously! cause i'm not even a silk da shocker fan, but what messed him up is the amount of weak songs in between. Sometimes he just talking real fast and to me that dosen't cut it for rap. But if you wanna try listening to somebody from no limit, try silk. For the amount of songs you get, it's just about worth it."
4,Silkk look good and he really know how to flow too!!,"What more can I say, I luv this CD! I bought it a few dayz ago and I can't stop listenin to it. I also think he looks damn good too!!"
1,Horrible CD,"This CD is a piece of trash. I don't see how an artist could go from a great CD (Charge it to da Game), to such a piece of crap. Silkk doesn't know how to rap, and No Limit is completely washed up. There are a few decent songs on this album, but none that are noteworthy. Silkk's style is original. Nobody else raps the way he does. I wonder why? Maybe it's because his style is horrible. He can't flow. He starts to rap for a few seconds, then stops, then starts again. A good way to describe his style would be herky-jerky. Also, why do him and Master P keep rapping about having to hustle to survive. They're extremely rich and very bad liars. Everyone knows they don't live in the ghetto anymore, so they should quit rapping about it. Bottom line, don't buy this CD unless you want to use it as a frisbee."
1,Terrible this is the worst no limit cd i have!,"When i bought this cd, i wuz expecting musical talent involved, but i guess it duznt run in the family. Silkk wuz never any good at rapping and this cd proves it. after listening to the cd 3 times, i put it away, and to today i wont touch that trash. C-Murder seems 2 only have talent nowadays, hes the only smart 1 to jump off of the no limit bandwagon before it becomes the badboy records of the south"
2,Pretty lame.,"My two priorities in purchasing a rap album are 1) Lyrics, 2) Phat Beats. First, No Limit has never been known for profound lyrics. The content of the lyrics are laughable, Made Man being no exception. Second, some of the beats on this album are so ridiculous I almost cried. They are so simple and lame, it seems Silkk slapped them together in 2 minutes. ie. ""All Because of you."" ""MR. 99"" and many others that I can't remember because nothing on this album is worth remembering. 2 stars for It aint my fault, and the Snoop Dogg song, because Snoop is immortal. If you really want it, get it used like I did. [Cheap] at a used record store, and it's hardly worth that."
1,The Worst CD I have EVER heard,"This is the worst CD I've ever heard in my entire life. I'm SOOOOO glad that I didn't actually buy it. I started to, but I heard a friend's copy first. While listening to it, I just started laughing because it's so bad that it's actually kinda funny that something so horrible was even put out. Silkk the Shocker is really terrible. I would give it negative stars if I could."
3,this was alright,silkk had some good tracks on here i really liked nubmer 19 southside n---as and i really liked 4. ghetto rain and 16. its going around outside.its a good album i'am sure it's still bumpin somewhere in da dirty .
5,Silkk the Shocker is definetely making his own way.,"Silkk the Shocker is doing his thing in the rap game. Many people say that he is following in the footsteps of his brother but, Shocker has taken his raps and made it main stream.I do believe Silkk will be the next Made Man in the entertainment industry. This CD proves he is versitile with his raps. Do not be suprised if you see Silkk in movies and on television. He might be the only TRU Ghetto rapper to give Will Smith and LL Cool J a run for their money. Now there is a concept.East,West adn the Dirty South all together in a movie. Deronnious R. Heidelberg BILOXI, MS."
2,I totally disliked this CD,"I mean I expected so much more! It's as if No Limit is on some wild crazy stuff.What happened to the sweet bass-bumping groove beats from ""Charge it to the game""? That was real sweet. That CD is a classic. ""Made Man"" is just filth! I guess P knows thats people will just buy it because it's No Limit,But let someone get a sample of it first;If you like real music his CD will not be getting bought!I was a ""Die Hard"" No Limit fan but the last several with exception of Mia-X have been a total disappointment.I have to sample a No Limit CD before I buy it. The last 5-6 albums have been a total waste of money."
2,THIS AIN'T NO GOOD!,"I want y'all same people to be on my NIZZUTS when I drop some $#!+ in the rap toilet. Silkk has skills, but he should've taken his time on this album. I like SOME of the songs but I think a few of the beats don't go with his raps. It sounds like an underground mix tape, not like something from an established rapper. Look for the Mercenaries in '99."
5,SILKK KICKS TOTAL BOOTAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Silkk's cd's have always been tight but this one is the tightest of all!!! I LOVE THE PHAT BEATS AND LYRICS!!!!!! This is a definate 5 star!!! So if you want my advice, buy this cd right now it has cool beats and lyrics!!!!!!"
2,Silkk could have done better,"I was dissapointed at this cd I do like the other cd's mystical's cd was better than silkks, and the best one of all of them it's old but it's still jammin' is ""GHETTO D"", CD was slammin', next time I buy no limit I will listen to it first, because ""P"" is just pumpin' out cd's to be greedy they should concentrate more on quality."
2,THIS CD IS A BIG DISAPPOINT,"THIS WAS DISAPPOINTING. TRACK 1 IS THE TIGHTEST. 2,3,10,12,18 ARE ALRIGHT BUT I EXPECTED MORE FROM NO LIMIT THIS CD U CAN SKIP AND FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE OUT I AM A NO LIMIT FAN TO THE FULLEST BUT IF THE CD IS WACK THE CD IS WACK AND MADE MAN IS WAC, FOR ONE HE HAS TO MANY SLOW SONGS ON IT. IT SHOULD BE MORE HARD CORE LIKE THE FIRST TWO. I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE TO TRY NEW THINGS BUT U KNOW THE SAYING, IF AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT. ALSO THEY DROPPED THIS CD TO FAST, THE LAST ONE WAS DROPPED JUST LAST FEBRUARY."
1,I would have put zero stars if that was an option,I listened to No Limit music about 4 years ago and it wasn't bad. Since it has hit MTV it has been the most annoying rap (this should have a c in front of it) I have EVER heard. Mystical doesn't belong on any album if anyone wishes to remain sane. It ain't my fault is a perfect example of how horrible no limit music has gotten. I am a rap fan and I cringe and leave every time that song comes on. IT'S HORRIBLE!!!
1,I would like to give it 0 stars,"Where do I begin?? I mean No Limit Records Records use to have some of the finest rappers around. And then after P's the Last Don, No Limit when down the toilet! Silk's new CD is one of the all time worst rap records I have ever purchased. First off, the beats are horrible and cheesey, plus the lyrics are boring to listen to. I mean what where Master P and Silk thinking when they put this record together. I personally don't see how anyone can give Silk more then one star. The only tract worth listening to is the one with Snoop."
1,this bites big no limit schlong,"this cd was terrible. all it is is a bunch of fake black guys runnin around messing around with girls, shooting people and smoking dope. That is not original and this guy needs to change his style. so do all the other no limit guys"
1,Zero Stars.........Oh My Goodness!,"I CANNOT BELIEVE I forgot how WACK this album is!!!! Man a few months ago I proclaimed Mase's Double Up as the worst album I owned, but then the other day I miraculously found this cd in my case. I had forgotten all about it! Silkk The Shocker has absolutely no flow and definitely no skills. To Be honest I have no clue as to why I even purchased it in the first place. There are zero DECENT songs. This is by far the worst album I own. I'm sorry Mase i forgot all about this one. The only thing this is good for is a laugh. Double Up is 1000 times better than this. Silkk has released the WORST No Limit album ever( this one) and is the worst rapper on the label ( now or ever was on the label) Buy this cd for someone that you hate. Trust Me do not even make eye contact with this one it is not worth it. Warning Has Been Issued."
2,Bad No Limit cd,Every song is slow and it makes him sound like a puss. He has a lot of talent but he didn't use it at all.
3,"Close,BUT NO CIGAR","When i heard that Silkk the shockker was coming out,i was pretty excited to see how much he and the rest of No Limit has grown, sorry to say that he hasnt grown too much. The first track on the cd is OFF DA HOOK, but then after that, you cant say too much. Also track 11&16 does show a little maturity on his part and you cant deny that on track 10 ""No Limit"" he gets rowdy. But when its all said and done, you wish that he would have cut about 4 songs off of his album, especially track 9. When you listen to this album, you will know that it is the man they call Veto,but you just wonder, what could have been with a little more effort."
2,Nothing Really Worth Your Money,"This album just doesn't have the spark of ""Charge It To Da Game"", it's just not that good ( Like most of No Limit's other cds). Not but maybe 5 or 6 times does Silkk's flow sound good on this cd. The only good songs that are really worth listening to the ones that feature other artists. The few good tracks are ""Ain't My Fault pt. 2"" (Thanks to Mystikal), ""You Know What We Bout"", and ""It Takes More"" (supa-tight track because of the GC). The best track is ""It Takes More"". The Ghetto Commision are 1 of the shining spots off the tank, but they are no reason to buy this cd. Take my advice and stay away from this cd, but you should purchase ""Charge It To Da Game"" if you want to hear some good music. There just aren't enough tracks on this cd that are reasonable, try again Silkk (and Master P go home!)."
1,Silkk is a horrible rapper,"Lot of f*cking issues here. Silkk the Shocker cannot rap. The only decent thing on No Limit is C-murder. If you want good hip hop, try pjays undapendent recordings."
3,A thought to hear,"silkk this cd was o.k. i think he could have done better, he is gettin better at his rappin skills and silkk keep pushin'."
5,SILKK THE SHOCKER,SILKK THE SHOCKER IS TO FINE I HOPE HE COME TO KANSAS CITY FOR A CONCERT WITH THE NOLIMIT FAMILY SO I CAN SEE ALL OF THEM IN PERSON AND MEET WITH THEM BACK STAGE BY MYSELF.
1,"Unbelievable, just unbelievable","How can someone make a CD that is THIS BAD? The only track that stands out are song #3 and 14. This is the worst album I've EVER heard from the No Limit family and there couldn't be something that's worse than this. Silkk's skills has degraded vastly and now it's official, The Shocker has no talent whatsoever and he's the worst rapper in No Limit. This album can't even be compared to Charge It 2 Da Game(Which was a classic). Silkk, don't make any more albums. This is the limit for you."
5,"silkk,masterp,mystikal #1 fan of NOLIMIT DEEDWARD MURPHY",i like silkk.he got style to me he rap like his brother c murder. on c murder new cd bossalinie he got fast song and he got the slow songs. but when silkk rap he rap fast then he slows down i think that why he is not the best nolimitrapper.p i may be the biggest no limit fan but p done lost his touch . on ice cream man p was a hard rapper now on ghetto d he did some tight song i think p is leaving rapping for the acting businesss but that is just me.now me DeEdward Murphy is the biggest mystikal fan in or on this planet.i lie mystikal when he was by his self i remember when he made beware it was the tighest sog i ever heard. i didnt now who it was the tightest part was when he said i the armadillo that it for me NoLiMiT sOiLdErS bOuT iT bOuT iT aNd RoWdY rOwDy TrU NOLIMIT FAMILY FIEND MIAX MASTERP CMURDER SOUJIA SLIM SILKK MYSTIKAL SNOOP BIG ED HOT BOYZ -N- 504 BOYZ
5,HOOOOT!,"I don't know why everyone is buggin on this album. Silkk the Shocker has got to be one of the most (if not, the best) talented mc to step in the game. His flow is unbelievable. Every track he rips it. He must've put his heart and soul in this because I've never heard him rap this good before. I could just picture his saliva and spit splattering onto the mic in the studio as he spat his rhymes out. I mean, his rhymes were amazing. I just wish I could give this album 100,000 plus stars. Can't nobody in the rap game touch my dog Silkk. Silkk would rip Jay Z, DMX, and Twista in a freestyle battle. Nobody can touch him. I can't wait for him to die so they could start making double cd's of him as a rememberence of his legacy in the rap game. That would be sick."
2,"Boring and nowhere near ""Charge It 2 Da Game""","What the Heck is this? Silk's talent is being wasted through this CD. It is boring and lackluster. The first two singles, ""It Ain't My Fault Part 2"" and ""Somebody Like Me"" make me not want to buy this CD even more. Silk is a great rapper, but he'll go nowhere if he keeps releasing CD's like this one."
1,This album is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If anyone likes this album, they are nuts. I'm glad that I borrowed it from a friend, instead of buying it because I would've wasted my money. The only song worth listening to is It Ain't My Fault 2. Silkk is a good rapper and it shows that he rushed on this album. His last album was much better. Silkk don't rush your next albums. If you want to buy a NL album that came out this year buy Snoop's and check out C-Murder's. Buy Master P's greatest hits when that comes out later this year."
3,"Well, good if you like that sort of thing.","Silkk the Shocker seems to like to talk about himself a little too much in this album. Some of the songs such as the one about his dead friends seem to have something in them but the rest seem so bleak and empty with nothing to them. Overall, if you like listening about how great somebody else's life is buy this album."
1,Garbage; don't waste your money.,"I beg of you, don't waste your money on this latest serving of No Limit Records recycled garbage. This watered down cd further proves that No Limit Records is on its death-bed. The only good song on this cd is a remix of a hit that came out last year. As usual on this cd, Silkk shows that he has absolutely no skills on the mic. Also exposed is the Beats By the Pound crew for their lack of originality. No Limit certainly was a lot better when they weren't releasing 5 cd's a month, all with 20 or more songs. If you are looking for musical originality and versatile lyrics, do yourself a favor and check out Mannie Fresh and Cash Money records."
1,Weak like clock radio speakers,"Sweet Jesus, is this man untalented. I am confident that you could drive to a randomly selected urban junior high school, walk into the cafeteria, and find plenty of 7th and 8th grade kids who could drop a better LP than this.I guess he's trying to spit that jerky, stop-start flow often associated with the Dirty South. (It's not my favorite style, but in the hands of actual, talented rappers like OutKast, it can be cool.) Silkk, however, just stumbles all over the track at random without any meaningful flow or syncopation. It's embarrassing.His previous album at least had some half-decent production. Not this one."
1,Could Get An Award For The Worst Rap Album Ever,"I never felt Silkk the Shocker, and don't think he has any skills. I'm not a hater, I just tell the truth. He raps for a few seconds, takes a break and raps again.His lyrics is bling bling and stuff you heard 100 of times before from Cash Money. And the beats is very weak. It doesn't fit the ""rappin"" at all.I mean I don't think No Limit is talented either, but they do indeed have something. But Silkk on the other hand might be one of the worst rappers ever. The only reason he sold was 'cause No Limit was hot back then.Mase and even Loon is 10 times better than this.Stay away and buy something by those who deserve it.AZ, Nas, Cormega, Rakim, KRS-One, 2Pac and Mac Mall will get your money well spended."
1,THIS ALBUM IS REALLY BAD!,"NOW THIS CD IS NO LIMIT YEAH RIGHT,I THREW THIS CD RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW.THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS IT AINT MY FAULT 2,EVERYTHING ELSE IS A WASTE OF TIME,I SHOULD OF SPENT MY MONEY ON SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF THIS MESS. SILKK'S FIRST IS THE BEST AND ALWAYS WILL BE!!NO LIMIT KEEPS GETTIN GAYER AND GAYER.DO NOT BUY THIS CD, BUY THE FIRST OR SECOND SILKK."
1,It wasn't all that!,"I got one word to describe this album....WEAK! I didn't like this CD at all! The only good song on it is ""It Ain't My fault 2. If you want a good No Limit album, buy C-Murder's ""Bossalinie"". It's much better."
2,Silkk,i think Silkk has gone down hill since his 1st album The Shocker this is his one of the worst nolimit albums. I think Silkk gets too much credit I think C-Murder deserves the credit that Silkk gets.
3,3rd time wasnt the charm!!!!!!!!!!!!,plain and simple he rushed this lp....there is some tight tracks but...charge it to da game was better by far...silkk should listen to c-murders bossalinie..now there is a hott cd
3,THE DIRTY DIRTY SOUTH!!!!,"This cd of Silkk's was ok but Charge It To The Game was better. The best song on this cd is Somebody Like Me featuring Mya with her sexy @$$. The best cd's I have heard from no limit is Ghetto Dope, The Last Don, Ice Cream Man(Master P); Ghetto Fabulous, Unpredictable(Mystikal); Shell Shocked(Mac); There is One In Every Family(Fiend); TRU,and Charge It to the Game(Silkk); Make more bump like these cd's YA HEARD ME!!! EVEYBODY ELSE ON NO LIMIT CAN HANG IT UP!!!"
1,The Worst I ever heard,Silk's new album came out too fast. I think he should take time to make a proper rap album.
4,A Solid Album,"I can honestly say that this is the one no limit CD I have liked lately. It is one of those CD's that you can listen to all the way through, although it does have some flaws. I considered track #1 the best out of the whole album, but most of the others were pretty good as well. I would recommend this CD whole heartedly."
5,Recommended.,"Very responsible, the product was for a fellow jeep, very happy with the purchase. This year make another purchase of this product, I expect the same treatment."
3,This toy requires a lot of adult assistance.,"The 3 and 4-year-old children in my preschool class really like this airplane. The only problem is that it uses an elastic band to hold the ""pilot"" in place. The children can get the pilot out by themselves but they cannot get the band around him to put him back. It's even hard for me. This might not be a problem for a 6-year-old but I'm not sure that's the age most interested in playing with this toy."
1,Too Tiny,Bought this for my baby but didnt realize how tiny it was and how many small parts there were. Would be cute as decoration but needed to return it.
4,excellent and not plastic !!,"my 3 yr old son loves this toy and a similar one --the guy pops out and he likes making them walk around...I like it because it is not plastic and it has lots of imagination in it. We have an excavator too, simply put the plan toys rule !!"
2,Difficult to manipulate,"There is a small rubber band that you ""wrap"" around the pilot to keep him in place. I can barely make it work, no chance a small kid can make it work."
4,"Edo, Art in Japan","Beautiful catalog from the National Gallery show many years ago. Painting, artifacts, prints, screens. Gorgeous show.Book in perfect shape."
2,Its fine if you want your child to come out punching!!,"For adults into Batman and Superman its okay.I made the mistake of buying it for my 3 year old, and its just too violent. For starters Batman and Superman aren't exactly friends, in fact they have a punch up. As Clarke Kent and Bruce Wayne, they are both chasing Lois Lane - who is beautifully drawn by the way. I would have thought Batman and Superman would have gotten along really well, well they don't. Sure they work together at the end but its forced.Too much violence for the young ones, probably okay for the adult fans."
3,"OK, but not the best","Don't get me wrong as it is pretty fun, but it really pales in comparison to Mask of the Phantasm and the Mr. Freeze film. This is more Superman (who is very boring) as opposed to Batman, which is kind of a bummer.As usual The Joker and Harley Quinn totally steal the show! Seeing The Joker is top form really brings to life how lame Luthor is as a villian."
2,NOT a movie for children,"My son is a real batman fan and I was trying to avoid the PG and PG-13 rated violence of recent films. I bought this because of its G rating. The first five minutes alone were filled with guns, shooting, and fighting. It is an awful film for children to watch!! I would much rather him see a sex scene than this movie. Even the good guys are jealous and vindictive."
4,"Entertaining, but......","Its lacking. The other DC animated features are better. The characters are perfectly written and voiced. Very good. More of it should have been in Gotham, though."
2,A Disappoionting Meeting Of Batman & Superman,"The Long awaited meeting of Batman and Superman was to me a disappointment. The origional Batman The Animated Series had unmatched design and style. It seems that Bruce Timm and Pual Dini have gotten lazy while basking in their success. The ""New Look"" looks like a half effort; sloppy. Batman, once one with the shadows now struts about in full veiw, his once huge cloak wrapped about him (Looking very cool) now hangs limply from his back. Superman seems slow witted and unaware of his potential, using one power at a time, instead of an effective combination of strength, speed, invulnerability etc. Not to mention the fact that he is battered back by mere bullets. Growing up with Batman The Animated Series, I expected a better effort from Timm and Dini. Stop hiding behind more violence and explosions and turn out some quality work, guys. Thanks for your time"
1,Violence on Women in a Warner Brothers Movie?!!?,"Unbelievable that Warner Brothers would produce a ""Family Entertainment"" movie that includes violence on women. There are multiple scenes where the bad guys are punching or hitting the women for no reason. This is definitely not a movie for young children."
3,Good....but not great.,Let me start off by saying that I love both Superman and Batman and put them together and I got have it. That being said this was not there best work. When you put two complexed and iconic figures together (Superman/Batman) and then you pit them against their greatest foes (Lex Luthor/The Joker) you expect an explosion not a firework display. Now don't get me wrong it wasn't horrible and I didn't hate it I guess I just expected more. This was more suitable for an episode of J.L.A. or something around that line. There were some good points however brief. The back and fourth between the heroes and villains as well as with each other was quite entertaining. So if your like me and just love all that is Superman/Batman give it a look. Just remember don't expect too much and don't over pay.
3,Not bad but not that great either...,"It was interesting to see Superman and Batman interacting...I think the story could've been better done. Lex Luthor was pretty much a supporting character and letting the Joker pretty much run the whole show. Hopefully, we'll all be treated a lot better if WB decides to do this again. If you want to catch a good Batman Animated movie..check out Mask of the Phantasm and you will not be disappointed. If you're a hard core Batman or Superman fan, this movie is all right but if you're not..then I would recommend something else..."
4,"Anyone up for a LIVE-ACTION ""Batman/Superman Movie""?","I am. Anyway, to start out it's good fun to see Superman (Tim Daly) and Batman (Kevin Conroy) team up in one movie. There's nothing extra on the VHS version as far as trailers are concerned. But you can still enjoy the movie. ""The New Batman Adventures"" is much more violent than ""Batman: the Animated Series"", as for ""Superman: The Animated Series"" is less offensive than ""TNBA"" (if at all).Trivia: Did you know that this movie was originaly three episodes of ""Superman: The Animated Series"" titled ""World's Finest""?"
5,nice,I am not a fan of comic but I bought this for my brother as a chrismtas stocker and he loved it and I enjoyed it.
5,Loved it as a kid. Still love it as an adult.,"Any child of the 90s will remember Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, and the Batman/Superman Adventures. This movie is a great team up between two of DC's most beloved characters and will be as entertaining to the parents as it is to the kids.For those wondering, these episodes are not included in the Batman:TAS box set, so don't worry about doubling up if either you or a gift recipient already has those episodes."
5,Great Combination,"If you enjoy the animated series vocalized by Tim Daly (Superman) and Kevin Conroy (Batman) and the new Justice League, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. My husband and I both found the story line to hold our attention and be entertaining, and our son was instantly addicted. I especially enjoy how the characters seem to be more adult than their 1970's conterparts, without being too grown up for kids to identify with their heros."
4,Perfect... ish...,"Quite honestly I liked how this movie flowed. It wasn't too choppy and it didn't feel forced. I even enjoyed the parts with superman, though I've never, ever been a superman fan. However, there was one big plot hole:Lois Lane works with Clark Kent every day. However, she never realizes that he's superman, even though all Superman does is changes his hair and takes off his glasses. But she dates Batman for a week and realizes it's him RIGHT when his mask gets ripped off.This kinda killed it for me, but honestly it has some awesome quotes and moments."
4,Love the show but that copy was just bad..,"First off, this series of episodes was one of my favorites as I liked the bit of tension between Batman and Superman. The animation was great when it was released so why does the dvd look like garbage? Okay, okay, it's not that bad, but it's no Batman Beyond either. The Batman Beyond Return of the Joker disc was beautiful to watch while the Batman/Supeman movie made me wince with each line noise I saw. It's definitely a weathered copy and if clear visuals is your thing(I'm assuming it is if you own a dvd player), you'd be thoroughly annoyed like I was. I guess that's why they can keep that low price point. No really good extras on the disc and deterioted animated to boot. Oh well, if you can get oer that, you'll see what a great storyline this disc has, but for me, it's really hard considering how a dvd copy should always look crisp and clear."
5,Personal and Challenging,"God Whispers rattles the cage of mediocre Christian spirituality by forcing us to run head on into that one truth we Christians find so hard to believe--God still speaks to his children. In an intimate yet practical way, Margaret shares real-world examples of how God speaks to us today, and challenges us to take the risk to listen and follow His whispers in our daily lives. God Whispers is a solid, biblical exploration of a subject desperately close to our souls.--Michael D. Warden, author of ""Alone With God: Biblical Inspiration for the Unmarried"""
5,You Really CAN Hear God!,This book clearly explains how easy it is to hear God and how He is constantly speaking to us...in so many ways that we so easily overlook. It is amazing to see how close...really close..God is to us and how simple it can be to hear His voice. He made it simple enough that a child can hear Him. Buy this book..you won't regret it!
4,almost everything you need for cleaning and polishing,"This kit has just about everything you need for cleaning and polishing anything small and delicate. I've used the various tools to clean electrical contacts and car battery poles and watches while changing batteries, and the rotary sandpaper is perfect on the dog's nails. I gave it 4 stars because it could have included a brass brush (which I bought separately) and they supplied only one polishing compound which produces a high luster finish, but not a mirror finish. I recommend testing each tool on something out of sight or of little value before using it on anything good. But, if each tool in the kit were bought separately, it would have cost 4X as much. All in all, it's a very good deal. Delivery was ahead of schedule, and that's a good thing too!"
5,"Dremel tools, what can I say",Nice kits with several different tools. These work well when used as intended as most Dremel tools do.
5,Great Dremel accessory pack,"I was really having a hard time finding the accessories I needed to polish some jewelry. When I found this pack, I was delighted. I like that it comes in its own little storage case, and includes most of the tips that you will need. It's really too bad that it doesn't include any soft brushes or cotton wheels, but those are available I'm sure.Definitely a nice purchase for the price."
1,Mandrels do Not Secure the Polishing Tips for Long,"I bought this kit to use with my Dremel 4000. I restore old Kodak folding cameras and had grown tired of hand cleaning and polishing the metal.But I found this to be Worthless! If you screw a Polishing Wheel or Tip onto the Mandrel, it only takes a minute or two before the tip stops spinning with the Mandrel (just strips out inside the tip or wheel). I only use moderate pressure...you have to in order to accomplish the task.Not sure if others are having the same issues?"
3,Speed dating,"Overall, its a good read and you get some helpful information.What this book lacks is the need for more information on the business part of speed dating, such as marketing, which is quite important.For some people I may recomend you find this info either through research or actually going to a speed dating event. The book isn't really worth what it costs but then again, there isn't really anything similar to it on the market."
3,Good starter book,I am in the process of starting up a dating events business similar to speed dating so this book was a good tool. It contained some good hints but I found that there really wasn't a lot of content (for instance - 2 pages for Marketing which I think is one of the most important pieces). It was a good starting point though and it confirmed for me that all the aspects I was looking at were indeed what was needed. I especially liked the Trade Secrets Chapter ... that was helpful.
1,Does not fit with play yard,I purchased this to be an extension to the super yard I bought because the site suggested it. These extensions do not fit with the play yard.
4,great to keep kids and dogs out or in,This gate was easy to put up. It closes 90% of the time. I would buy it again.
2,arrived damaged.,"This may have been a good product, but the boxes arrived destroyed. Absilutely not the carriers fault. Amazon did such bad packing, there was no way it could have survived the trip. And since the delivery box was destroyed, it would cost me more to pay the local pack and ship to return the damaged extension and wait for replacement. Instead, I went to the local PetSmart and bought this product off the shelf from them. Should have done that in the first place and saved myself the hassle. The Amazon extension is headed to the trash."
3,SAVE YOUR RECEIPT!!,"I have mixed feelings about this lopper. The light weight and smooth action are great, and it cut without requiring great effort. A minor complaint is that you have to open the handles very wide - almost 180 degrees - to get the sharply hooked blades open enough to reach around a branch. Thus the lopper can't be used to thin out interior stems in shrubs. My major complaint is that after a couple of years of use, the cutting blade snapped in half while cutting a small branch. Yes, there's a replacement warranty. But you have to have your proof of purchase, and enough time had gone by that I had misplaced mine. Admittedly I was careless with it, mostly because I had never had a quality tool break before. I plan to replace with a Felco lopper - the blade isn't as sharply hooked; I've never had a problem with my No.2 pruner; and I know I can get replacement parts if I need to."
4,A great lopper but ........,"I bought my Fiskars 96276935 lopper from Amazon in December 2004, a little over a year ago and have used it extensively. I really like that it will cut relatively large branches. However, while cutting a small 1"" or so diameter tree recently the blade snapped off as reported by E.Chang. I bought a different model Fiskars lopper locally, one without the power gear, as I had a lot of trimming to do. I noted on a label on the new trimmer that it has a lifetime guarantee. I don't recall if the broken one had a lifetime guarantee, but will try to get Fiskars to send a replacement or replacement blade."
2,not what I expected,"Starting with the positive, the mechanical advantage is amazing. You really can effortlessly cut anything that fits in the jaws. The negative side is that the jaws are flimsy and separate sideways. On small 1/4 twigs they don't cut, they just wedge between the jaws. On large branches it cuts through everything except the last piece of bark leaving the two pieces still joined. The whole point of the loppers is to cut through branches, and when it leaves the pieces connected with bark, or wedged between the jaws, it doesn't do its job. I even tightened down the pivot bolts hoping this would hold the jaws together, but that didn't work either. I don't care how powerful it is when it doesn't make the cut. I am returning this and buying a different brand."
5,The best lopper on the market.,I have used other loppers before and nothing can compare with these. Theymake short work of small limbs and power through all smaller jobs. The Power Gear really does make it easy to cut with. I won't buy anything else for my small trimming jobs. They are the top of the line and well worth their cost.
3,So So,I bought this for my mother in law to listen too... and she is not too interested in it. I suppose if she could still dance she may enjoy it more. I think it has pleasant music.
2,Something,Well... im 15 and a huge fan of Bjork.. i think shes like the best.. But when i bought this mtv unpluged of Bjork i was very disappointed. You can tell she was held back from going deep in to her songs...Like her live at camberige was so awesome..she owned the stage and she could do whatever she wanted unlike in mtv unpluged.. but hey.. its best to always have bjorks stuff.. just to say ya got it..
2,Blah,This was not good at all. im a huge fan of bjork and she so so held back.. she could not go wild and run around and be all funky.
3,"Characters are correct, but story could be better...","The characters are and their personalities are captured good, but the story isnt the best. The Author Ashley McConnell does better in the Pilot story and the second book:The Price to Pay. The story isnt as much of a stargate story as the other few of her books, the whole big moths and the triangular head robots was kinda rediculous. I expected better imagination and better story and character line because the first 2 books were better, So i give this one a 3."
2,"Too much Hammond, not enough action","This book was a real disappointment. There were several scenes throughout the book that were not realistic and others that were incredibly boring, such as the entire first chapter which focused on Hammond's trip to the SGC. Do we really need to know Hammond's history? There were also some blatant mistakes such as Carter being referred to as a Captain and a Major in the same chapter. I hope that they find a new author to continue this book series because McConnell is not doing the show justice."
2,"Nice Info, Not Much Action","I learned things I've never known about NORAD and I really liked seeing how the fictional SGC worked in conjunction with what I assume is real info about NORAD. McConnell's clearly done her research. The characters, as with all of her SG books, ring true, but the late-story action comes off as second banana. The aliens this time are Bug-eyed Monsters reminicent of 1950s s-f and the final event feels a bit contrived. McConnell's writing is smooth--as is her speculation about what could happen if the Gate was exposed felt realistic. If you adjust your expectations, it's well worth the read."
4,Not as good as The Price you pay,The First Ammendment is good it's about a reporter that get's into the SGC facillity and goes through the Stargate. While it is good it is not as good as the Price you pay. Neither of the books read like a television show. And some of the characters personalities are not exactly correct.
2,Dissapointing first read,"I have always been a massive stargate fan from the beginning, so expected this book to be something it isn't. The actually story needs time to take off and then this is ruined by the blatant flaws. Sam Carter seemed to change rank three time on the same page and you can't quite decide which team is coming through to block Morley (SG-3 or SG-9). Even the smaller characters changed rank. I think the business with NORAD sat on top of the SGC was just silly, McConnel should have done a lot more work before trying to sell us this."
3,1st Amendment OK,"1st Amendment was OK. Not terrific for science fiction and I really think the creatures at the end of the book were too silly. The beginning of the book had promise, but it fell rather flat. However, as an SG1 fan, I'd recommend it to another SG1 fan who isn't craving for very technical scifi. The cover was great."
1,Missing parts,"This may be an unfair review, because all the hardware was missing from the shippment. This could have happned in transit because the box had been taped up. Amazon gave me very easy instructions on how to return the product."
2,Not as great as previous reviewers say...,"I bought this product specifically to use with a Nordic Track elliptical on a soft carpet. This mat has helped to lower the amount of sliding the equipment does on the floor, but it hasn't eliminated movement altogether. I ended up having to lay a thin sheet of particle board over the mat but under the elliptical to save the carpet and stop the movement."
1,Amazon needs to read these reviews!,"Assuming that the issue must have been addressed by now, I ordered a Treadsolid and got--you guessed it--a Treadmat.The mistaken identity saga continues!This is what I get for assuming, I suppose.If you want the right mat, get it elsewhere. Unless you enjoy the prospect of dragging a large box to the P.O. to return it to Amazon....."
4,Solid Floor Protection,"I bought this mat to protect my laminate floor from my 300lb treadmill and I am confident it will do the job. It is very sturdy and the treadmill stays in place. I thought it was a little pricey at first, but after seeing what happens to inferior mats purchased by friends, it really is a bargain. After a month of heavy use there is virtually no wear at all on either the mat and more importantly the laminate floor. Shipping was amazingly fast."
4,How do you review a treadmill mat?,Can't really say too much about this product other than it seems to be doing the job just fine. It appears to be a solid construction and fits perfectly under our treadmill.
4,Definitely Worth the Money,Just purchased this mat - opened the box and no awful smell. Really sturdy and helps stabilizes my elliptical machine. Definitely worth the price.
4,Sent wrong mat,"The Treadsolid is great, although we got sent the wrong mat originally (they sent the lesser qualitiy, lesser priced treatmat). Amazon was prompt in correcting the error and giving directions to return the first one they sent."
5,Just Right,"Use this mat underneath a recumbent bike, in a room populated by our children and frequent young visitors.Periodically the little folk venture onto the bike and it does NOT move - the mat holds the position just as I had hoped.Others had mentioned smell, none here - we unrolled it, let it sit for a day to flatten out, and put the bike on it. Rock solid.Mat is well-made and exactly as described.We're actually thinking of buying others and repurposing them as a boot rest in snowy entryway(s) and other high-traffic areas."
3,Treadsolid,"First time the mat was shipped ,the box read as treadmat instead of treadsolid. The customer rep was helpful and provided free return shipment and shipped a new mat, the box which arrived second time had no label, but mat itself was slightly thicker than first. So I assume this must be treadsolid. I paid 29.99 for this mat."
5,Perfect for the job,I am completely satisfied with this purchase. The mat is about 1/3 inch thick and the material is very durable. I placed it under a gym quality treadmill. It was exactly the right size. The mat was slightly textured on one side. It rolled out flat and did not have any adverse smell.
3,Treadsolid or Treadmat?,"I returned the Treadsolid mat sent to me because the box it was shipped in was labeled Treadmat rather than Treadsolid. The Treadmat sells for $20 less than the Treadsolid. To me, it seems as if Amazon put the wrong product tracking label on the box.If the mat was indeed the Treadsolid, I was disappointed to see only an 1/8 inch thick mat - especially for the price. Being so thin, I was concerned it wouldn't absorb vibrations very well or perform well on carpet. It did appear as if it would be near impossible to rip or tear this mat though."
1,Missed opportunity,"Compelling history, great book, horrible video.The source content is fabulous but this video is appalling.The 'acting' is wooden with scenes that are poorly staged and devoid of interest.The 'script' is poorly written and the voiceovers are both unnecessary and unconvincing.The video is poorly shot, incredibly repetitious and flat out boring.Sadly, you should give this one a pass. The History Channel really missed a great opportunity with this video."
1,Surface Material,"If you're 12 or under and you'd like to see a rudimentary telling of the early years of United States history, this is the DVD for you! Completely skipping over the ratification of the Constitution, this two-volume series jumps right into the first presidency of Washington from the Declaration of Indpendence. If that doesn't sound skant enough for you, it completely skips Madison's presidency, while devoting about 10 minutes to Hamilton's duel. Really poorly done unless you just want a rudimentary, selective overview."
4,Robbed of Humanity,"I just started to read the book. It is good to tell of the conditions, the reality, and how children become street children, but also what can be/ is being done to relieve their bleak fortunes, and what has become of the children as they've grown into adulthood.I Thank Amazon for being able to find this book, more or less, without a lot of effort and hassle."
3,Too big,"This is a soft and comfortable toy for medium rodents (ferrets, rats).But it's very large! It was to big to fit in my cage properly. The hooks wouldn't adjust to a smaller angle and it was difficult to put the hooks around the bars in the cage.Only buy this product if you have a huge cage!"
3,eerie blue glow,The automatic time reset is fantastic. The problem is the blue glow. This thing is like daylight in a dark room and will hurt your eyes if you look directly at it in the middle of the night. They definitely needed a dimmer function. Another issue is the detachable power cord and a good reason why you need the automatic time reset. I would stick with the version with the red LED readout.
2,projection display problem,"This was my 2nd try for a projection clock radio - once again a disappointment! The projection display was upside down, and there was no way to rotate it. The only way I could read it was if I projected it on the opposite wall, which was not where I wanted it! We e-mailed the company and ask how we could turn the display right side up - there reply was that we couldn't! Also the back light was so bright it bothered us during the night, and there was no dimmer switch. So another projection clock radio gets returned! Does'nt anyone make a good one?!"
2,Predictable ending,"Fairly good book with a predictable ending (even for a series romance)--I thought the author would continue her plot to give us a satisfying ending, but a cowardly plot turn took us to an impossibly improbable but predictable ending."
2,OK but not AOK,Outlaws are of special interest to a certain segment of society. This book has even an extremely limited appeal to those of us that pay attention to such editions in hopes of finding new geneological material.
4,Dremel 687,Nice unit..small and easy to carry from job to job. I use it for filing dog nails. It is not loud which makes it a nicer experience for the dog.
4,Good set,There is just about every basic accessory you'll need for your Dremel in this set. Works just fine for my needs.
2,Flimsy,"Seller shipped the correct item quickly and at a very reasonable price. However, the adapter arrived damaged -- through no fault of the seller. The adapter was packed well and packaging was not crushed.It leads me to assume that the there are some quality control issues with the part itself. Were I you, I'd spend a few extra bucks and get a sturdier adapter."
4,Careful about which way around...,"I wanted to connect my 3.5mm headphones to a 6.3mm socket, so I ordered one of these. At the time title & description on this page read:""ARISTA 16-098 6.3mm (1/4"") to 3.5mm (Mini) Headphone Adapter""""Converts audio source with 6.3mm (1/4"") output to your headphones with a 3.5mm (Mini) plug""I received the correct part number, but is was in fact the other way around: it allows you to plug big headphones into a little socket.However, when I called J&R; about this they were very helpful, and immediately sent me part 16-097, for no charge.I presume that this page will be corrected at some point; that's why I put the description in here so that you can tell whether it's changed."
4,Arista 16-098,I bought this so I can enjoy music from my laptop. The only draw back is laptop pin hole is not meant for the abuse so stick to Ipod or other music devices
1,Garbage,"Horrible connection, drops one (or both!) channels at the slightest provocation. Avoid at all costs, and buy an adapter that's not complete garbage."
1,"FITS MY MICROPHONE, BUT MICROPHONE HAS POOR SOUND NOW!","This converted my HUGE 6.5 jack microphone to standard 3.5 jack and it works in my computer but the sound quality is horrible and very low. Keeping it because I only paid about $5 with shipping, you get what you pay for is so so so true!"
1,Poor connections,"Although it's hard to complain for the price, the adapter's 6.3mm input doesn't provide a very tight fit for my audio headphones (same problem on 2 different headphone sets I own). In fact I only receive mono sound output unless I delicately wiggle the headphone jack within the adapter a bit until I hear it come through in stereo. And when the sound does come in stereo it's quite hollow and lacking the richness and depth I know my headphones normally produce. At the end of the day, notwithstanding it was only a few dollars spent, it was also a few dollars wasted and I now need to go looking again for another (better quality) adapter as this one is pretty unusable."
2,great idea but it doesnt seem to work so well,in my experience the scald safe seems to say the water is too hot when its just right. i have had several people check my sons bath water at what to me feels perfect and they have all said it feels right. he appears comfortable and happy. yet the scald safe tells me his water is far too hot and turns bright pink. i was excited to have found something that i had found so fool proof but really all it helps with is knowing weather or not his water is too cold instead.
1,Pointless,"I thought this would be great but it turned out to be pointless. It changes color at a single degree so if it is purple the water appears to be too cold but one degree later, if it turns pink the water appears to be too hot. It is impossible to have the water stay at exactly the one degree that will make the disk stay half purple and half pink like the instruction suggest. We were much happier with the little yellow and green turtle thermometer that beeps if the water gets below or above a reasonable range."
2,Not useful - too conservative,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this is too conservative. I would never put a baby in such cool water for a bath. Sometimes he shivers in water that registers pink (too hot). My wrist is much more useful than this thing. Granted, this one is super cheap. But if it's useless, is it worth any money at all?"
2,Too conservative,"This seems to be calibrated too low. It turns pink when the water is barely warm at all. I know babies are much more sensitive but our baby shivers if we put her in water deemed ""just right"" by this thing. We have another bath thermometer that has a readout telling you the exact temperature, in addition to beeping when that temperature was too high (102 or higher)-- much more useful than this thing. Granted, this one is super cheap. But if it's useless, is it worth any money at all?"
4,My 4-year-old daughter is in love,"I bought this as a last-minute Christmas gift for my daughter with next-day shipping. Am I glad I did! As soon as she unwrapped the package, my daughter was spellbound. All she wants to do is snuggle her ""Harmony Bear"". Everyone she talks to, ""Do you know what I got for Christmas? A CARE BEAR!!"" I am grateful that these have come back. My daughter just loves her Harmony, and it pleases me that I have found something for her that hasn't lost her interest so quickly."
2,"Excellent magazine, best purchased at the newsstand.","Tough to decide how many stars to give Photo France; the magazine itself is exceptional: think of ""American Photo"" but more freewheeling in every way. Clearly 5/5. But my review here reflects the experience of purchasing a subscription from Amazon.I should have read the previous reviews before subscribing; I have yet to receive a single issue of this beautiful magazine, even though the vendor claims to have mailed out at least two issues. It's hard to know who to blame: the publisher, Amazon, the distributor, or the postman.If you're lucky enough to live near a good newsstand, save yourself the headache and just buy it in person. Spend your time enjoying the great photography instead of tracking down undelivered issues."
1,Worthless stylus,Okay pen no use as a stylus. But a proper stylus for a few more dollars. Not worth it all
2,Not as useful as I'd have liked it to be for an Iphone.,"The unit does have both a pen and stylus as advertised.I'm taking off two stars because it's cheaply made, seems more like a pen you'd find in the bargain bin at Staples, or at the dollar store.I'm taking off another star for the stylus itself.Now, these were available before the Iphone 3 & 3GS, so it's possible it's not Pilot's fault it doesn't interact well with the Iphone . I purchased this unit because I have fat fingers, and on the Iphone the letters and numbers on the right side of the keyboard give me trouble. I'd hoped the stylus would help me.The stylus is not responsive at all on the Iphone as you don't press down on the keyboard, instead you slide the key up. This stylus, for me at least, doesn't grab the key and allow me to pull it up.It may work great on other keyboards however, so you may find the stylus more useful. But that won't change the cheap look and feel."
3,WAY 2 EASY!,"I love Rocket Power. And when I saw a Gameboy Game for it, I had to buy it. When I started, I finished it in like the same hour! Then I was bored, having completed it, and let my sister play the games, something I never do. This game was good, and a slight waste of my time!"
3,good,well This game is pretty good but it takes a while to learn how to pass a level(easy medium hard). The controls are easy to learn and the graphics are decent. It gets boring after awhile. easy to beat on the easy level.
1,this game is a waste of money,"most of the people on here said that this game was easy but i dont know if i agree simply because i got tired of it like the first day. also like someone else said, the tricks are kind of hard to do because when you push the buttons, sometimes it doesnt work. i never play this game anymore because its realllly boring. so do yourself a favor, no matter how big a rocket power fan, and DONT BUY THIS GAME. it stinks."
2,WAY TOO EASY!,This game was fun but WAY TOO EASY! Less than 24 hours from buying it I had beaten the game. It was not worth saving my allowance for.
1,awful,This game is awful. THQ didn't make an effort to make this look a little 3-D. The controls are pretty bad you can almost never do tricks. Maybe if your a die-hard rocket power fan you'll like this. Please don't buy it.
1,Save Your Money-----PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been a fan of Imus' since the early 80's. He was extremely amusing until recently and his brother was also a lot of fun. This book isn't. As others have said-it's a blatant money making ripoff that is capitalizing on brother Don. It is short, shameful, poorly written, poorly organized and the worst 20 bucks ever spent. Yuck!"
1,The Sequel to Dumb and Dumber,"This annoying attempt to cash in on his brother's undeserved celebrity status can be summed up in one word--DUH! Fred appears to be a nice enough guy--unlike his ego-bloated brother, Don (the radio ""personality"")--but one can't help wondering how many trees bit the dust for this mess. Bring back the Farmer's Almanac!"
2,It just doesn't work.,"Fred's humour just does not come through. On his brother's radio show he is very funny. You don't see it in this book. Why a gifted writer like Mike Lupica would allow his name to be placed on this is beyond me. My guess is he owes Don Imus a favour of some kind, and this is the way he is satisfying the debt."
2,"Entertaining, atmospheric view of expats in modern Kenya","At times this book read like a more upscale version of a romance novel, which is usually enough to make me stop reading. Yet, I found this story engrossing, despite the cliches. The characters are a mixed-up group of whites who grew up in Africa and expatriates from Europe who live and love in close proximity. The setting in Nairobi and in the bush of Kenya gives the book a fresh feel. The characters are either simple or tortured, yet they are an interesting lot."
1,Rules of the Wild,"Boring. Reminded me of the Bonfire of the Vanities only set in Africa. And it only seemed like Africa from a concocted movie set. The characters were soap-operatic. Esme, the main character had all the other characters telling her how deep she is and yet her actions throughout the book are sophmoric. The idea of juxtapositioning the raw nature of Africa against the violence of the humanity that actually occupies Africa as home is what drew me to the book. But not enough description of the beauty as well as not enough explanation/focus of the political events. Only the drivel of drinking, drugging, sex, and unreal dialogue of the white privileged class."
1,Who needs men?,I thought this book was disgusting. I can't believe people (especially women) still read this kind of trash. I can't believe women STILL think they need a man to be happy and that this is still being written about. It is so degrading and demeaning to women who have a brain and a life...
5,"Fluid prose, vivid characters, spectacular imagery ...","Esme meets Africa for the first time largely by fluke. She finds much to love and hate, but in time, her lover settles under her skin.In this crisp, fluid novel, Marciano brings us into the lives and hearts of the contemporary white community in Kenya. She offers an accurate, if cynical, lens into its comforts, conflicts and uneasy contact with the larger community.Through her deft use of metaphor and down-to-earth dialogue, Marciano evokes a rare intimacy with her superficial, self-absorbed but earnestly-portrayed characters. She also uses vivid imagery in describing the landscape of Kenya and strong specificity in her setting - from Yaya shopping center to the midnight BA flight and Omo detergent - and comes across as one who really knows Esme's Kenya."
2,"""Days of our Lives in the African Bush""","Although Ms. Marciano has a way with a phrase here and there, this book is irritating in its pseudo-political correctness. While her character rails against the First-Worlders who never bother to learn anything about their African neighbors, she herself limits most of the reader's contact with them to servants and ""wise natives"" who work on her car! The main characters are trite and two-dimensional...oh...and don't forget incredibly beautiful and endowed with talents I never quite learned to appreciate! Who would want to know any of these people...longer than the one-night stand, at any rate??"
4,I couldn't put it down!,"I kept in mind while reading this novel that it was Marciano's first. She put a lot of emotion and thought into this novel, so much so that I could not put it down. At times, I could relate to some of the rhetorical questions she put forth. She did an outstanding job of describing the beauty/terror of the African continent.While the novel's main character, Esme, was quite shallow, you still wanted to know what was going through her mind. Adam was a distant character, and could have been developed better.Overall, the lack of continuity in the novel adds to its suspense. It makes the reader wonder.Great job for a first novel."
2,Rhetorical questions sink this one,"When Marciano sticks with the rules of the white society in modern day East Africa, she's on: her writing is toned and honest and it's loaded with rhythm. When she aims for the true meaning of romance and attachment, her prose falls into one rhetorical question after the next, and the grace of her language fails her. The reader never sees the whys and hows of Esme and Hunter falling in love; the reader is only pounded with the endless chat about how wonderful this phantom love is.As a writer, Marciano should have trusted her instinct and written the compelling story of contemporary East Africa. She should have left the painterly instincts behind, because as she needlessly aims at Dinesen territory, and even as Esme soars through the air in a small plane towards the end of the book, the reader is reminded not of Marciano's story so much as Dinesen's unparalleled prose that so perfectly captured the region over fifty years ago."
4,Very enjoyable,"Even though I may not quite qualify this as literature, I enjoyed this book very much (especially after reading a string of bad ones). I love books about Africa, always had a fascination for Kenya and read Blixen, Hemingway etc so I was delighted to find a new, more modern one in that vein. The characters can be frustrating at times but the story is interesting and it's the first time I ever see mention of the genocide in Rwanda in a book of fiction. The dichotomy of the ex-pat is well expressed also, when a single country and culture can no longer feel entirely like Home."
3,Expatriate Life in Kenya,"I am a former expatriate in South America and could relate to the community that forms in an isolated, developing world area. I thought she had some astute observations of the tight-knit community that forms in a situation like that. I have never been to Africa and I liked her descriptions of the country. It was a bit too female oriented, but of course she is a woman. Good read, hard to put down."
2,"Raw land, raw emotions. . .","While a bit too much like a soap-opera for my taste, the descriptions of emotions, landscape and culture of expat Nairobi made this book worth the read."
4,What are we to do?,I have just finished reading The Poisonwood Bible which stirred up the same feelings in me as did Rules of the Wild. I have lived as an ex-patriate in Mexico and am currently living in Puerto Rico. I wish very much to avoid the attitudes and behaviors of the characters in these books. I agree with the reviewers who praise Marciano for her accurate descriptions of some ex-pats. I would be interested in hearing from natives of countries such as Africa and Mexico what ex-pats might do to be better guests in their countries.
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"""Rules of the Wild"" is romantic, lush, descriptive, and a little maddening. Marciano's style takes me right back into Nairobi, and aptly captures the feeling of being a foreigner there. At the same time, Esme's imperfect character, so fully portrayed by Marciano, makes the feminist in me want to reach into the world she lives in and help her get over her desperate need for companionship. The irony and symbolism in the book are captured by the emotions it evokes in me. Somehow my feelings for Esme parallel my feelings for Africa: affection and respect, mixed with frustration and futility."
3,Fairly good effort for a first time author,"The story revolves around a young jaded Italian woman, Esmé, who recently lost her father. She is still very immature and doesn't see herself as an individual of value. Unfortunately the author never make Esmé vital and real either. What the author did do though was make me think about colonialism, prejudice and greed. The story embodies all of these things and offers no clear solutions to any of them. While the writing style is good, the romance aspect is too involved and the ""real"" Africa is not involved enough. A good first effort but could be alot better."
1,Leaves much to be desired.,"The promising premise and beautiful marketing of this novel are not ultimately fulfilled. Instead the reader is forced to experience contemporary Africa through the eyes of a selfish, pathetic Italian woman whose constant complaints about white priviledge never transform into a coherant critique of either whites in Africa in general or the main character in particular. Her dependancy upon the men in her life and her melodramatic reaction to her own bad choices do not make her endearing but annoying. Nevertheless, I read the entire novel, in the vain hope that it would show me more of the complexities of Africa -- which it did not."
2,"self-indulgent, self-righteous, and self-important.","some good observations. BUT the writer is a little too in love with herself. she tries to use irony and some comments of self-awareness to deflect the fact that esmee is truly just as shallow and vapid as the tourists she despises. the story and characters are unlikeable and not as intelligent as the author assumes. esmee comes across as believing herself the first to ""notice"" africa. dull, empty of real love, and not even sexy."
4,"Rich language, okay plot, not for everyone","I purchased this book because I had just read The Poisonwood Bible and was feeling intrigued by the idea of how white women and africa interact with each other. This book was perfect for further exploration of that concept. Marciano seems to have a great deal of insight, and her descriptive passages took my breath away. The only thing I didn't like about the book was purely personal - I simply didn't like the main character. Several of my friends who also read the book also disliked this character, and ended up not finishing the book at all. I would recommend that you give it a shot, but there are no guarantees!"
1,One line is not enough to tell how much I hated the book.,"A spoiled, beautiful and unappealing Italian woman, Esme, drifts into the ex-pat English-speaking community in Nairobi. There she continues her self-absorbed and aimless life, living with and off Adam, a white Kenyan who runs safaris. This gives author Marciano the opportunity to make nasty anti-American remarks about the people who go on safari. Esme cheats on Adam with a journalist who is assigned to cover the massacre in Rwanda. Marciano digresses from the main plot and goes on about the situation in Rwana which has nothing to do with carrying the characters or story along. The conclusion of the book is that there is no conclusionThis is an infuriating and unsatisfying book by a woman who I suspect is the doppelganger for her smug and nasty protagonist."
3,What happened to widescreen?,"Justice League has been airing on Cartoon Network two or three times a week, and one of those has always been widescreen. So what were they thinking in not putting the widscreen version on the DVD? I bet they could even fit both versions (widescreen and standard) on one side of the disc, especially considering all the other extras that they didn't bother including. I was especially surprised that there was no Bruce Timm interview like on the other Batman-related DVDs that have come out recently....it's a great show, but the DVD leaves much to be desired."
5,doesn't get any better,"Not since GI Joe and Transformers, has a cartoon demonstrated the teamwork and story that this cartoon does. If you don't watch the series, you need to. Stop letting kids watch Doug, Rugrats, and all that other stuff, and let them watch something that they can really learn from."
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE BATMAN SERIES, BUT NOT BAD...","I've heard it said that the first three episodes in this series (which make up the feature on this DVD) were also the weakest, but I've seen 'em all now, and I have to say that the premiere is the only one I care to own, largely because you get a good dose of Batman, who figures less prominently in the rest of the series. Better than Batman Beyond, not as good as The Batman Superman Movie."
4,"FOR ONCE, PAN AND SCAN IS GOOD!","Although I've always been an advocate of Widescreen over Pan and Scan, I have to side with P&S here. The cartoon network has created false widescreen by covering up the top and bottom of the picture on their re-runs of the show! It is not real widescreen and for once, Pan and Scan gives the whole picture ;)"
4,Short but entertaining...,"I was sitting at home feeling miserable (sore throat & ear infection) and decided to take a quick walk to the video store. I ended up renting this movie and it was pretty good! I'd actually forgotten all about the Justice League cartoons, I used to watch them after school almost every day at my friends house. Pretty good stuff, though I would also suggest renting this title instead of buying it because it is pretty pricey for the length. If you're a huge fan go ahead and buy it though, it IS good."
4,i like it ...,"the movie is good and tells how the group started...the thing is they should bring out a lot of justice leaguedvd's coz guys like me who like animations like thisjust want to watch some more ...i have my friends watch the disc with me and we we'reall asking for more...just keep on making dvd's about justice league...if your fans of batman, we think that he's sorry that he can't fly but in the end , he's still bad ass..."
5,"Great, Where's the Boxed Set?","Justice League is the most faithful adaption to comic book characters ever aired on television. It's fun, without being kiddie,an engaging without any hint of campiness. There is an open respect from the creators for the characters and for the intelligence of the audience. This origin episode was a must have, but I have to confess that I have not purchased the other two because I am anxious for a boxed set of the entire seasons 1-2. The price of $16.00 for four episodes is a bit steep when considering what comparable boxed set would cost. C'mon, Warner Brothers, get on the stick! Collect this fantastic series as it wass meant to be."
4,One star off for Pan Scaning,I saw this on Cartoon network it was great. It was way better than the Superfriends were. This is the Superfriends with everything bad taken out and everything good left in. This show has a great plot. Need visuals and tons of action. All and all a very good film. I only take a star off because this was filmed and it premired on Cartoon Network in widescreen. This DVD is presented in fullscreen. This makes no sense. If they wanted it in fullscreen why didn't they film it in fullscreen. All and all this is really bad. I won't buy this until it is released in widscreen.
3,This disk comes up short,"The problem with this disk is that it is only the one, hour long episode. Extras?? Nothing to really recommend this disk for. For the price, save your money and watch it on Cartoon Network. Great start to the series, but not a bargin disk by any means."
1,"On March 21, 2006 get the real thing","Warner did the same thing with Batman the animated series. First they put out a bunch of cheap worthless bare bones single disc sets and then boom release the same episodes in awsome boxed sets filled with episodes with some good extras. That is coming on March 21, 2006 when Warner will release Justice League the complete first season. That set includes 26 episodes for less then triple the price of this set which includes three. Do the math. Don't buy this or any of Warners lame single disc releases. Save your money for the real thing this March."
2,Not DermaPet now Dechra,Initially I was sent the wrong product frm MedVet International. They sent APPLE SCENTED Malacetic Otic by DermaPet and I did not order apple scented. The color of the bottle was even different from what I had at home. I sent it back and received full refund due to THEIR ERROR. I placed another order with them and discovered DermaPet is now owned by Dechra. This product has an awful apple fragrance to it. When I wanted to return product I was told I had to pay for return shipping since this time they did send me the correct product. I researched it and found out DermaPet is now owned by Dechra and Dechra claims all ingredients in Malacetic Otic are same as DermaPet. DermaPet did not have this awful smell to their Malacetic Otic ear cleaner. I sold my Dechra Malacetic Otics to a friend to avoid return shipping costs.
5,Best Dog Ear Cleaner!,"Fantastic ear cleaner. I have a cocker spaniel and he alwasys got ear infenctions, up until we tried this product. My vet recommended it and we swear by it now. We use it about 2ce a week and a bit more often in the summer. Smell a bit ""mediciny"" but it keeps those infections away. [...]I must say the price is WAY better, product is great, and delivery was fast. Highly recommend!"
5,Good cleaning solution,"This is a great solution for washing pet's ears. We've been using it 2-4 times a month, and haven't had any ear-related problems since.The 16oz bottle is the best deal."
4,Recommended by my vet...,"This product is recommended by my vet. I use it almost on a daily basis. It helps control the odor and remove debris from my dog's chronic ear infection. It doesn't cure her, but makes her more comfortable when I'm able to clean out what she's been excreting from her ear. It works well in conjunction with anti-biotics and to maintain the much needed cleanliness of her ears."
4,No bad for the money,Bought two pairs of these. Sound quality is not bad but a little weak on bass. They do a pretty good job of isolating external noise but I find the felt material used to line the ear cups make my ears get rather warm. The overall construction quality is of a more exspensive design so for the 25 dollars I paid for them I got a really good deal. I'd definitely buy them again .
3,Derma-Pet Ear Skin Cleanser,"Although this product is working fine, I don't feel the description was detailed enough to say that this ""Apple Fragrance"". I probably would not have purchased this product if I had known. I was expecting the normal unscented Derma-Pet Ear Skin Cleanser."
5,AWESOME!,"This ear cleaner has done total wonders for my dog's frequent ear infections. I tried another type of cleaner my vet gave me, but it really did nothing. Even when prescription medication wouldn't make her ear infections go away, using this stuff for a couple weeks will! It also smells much more pleasant than most other medications. I highly recommend it."
5,12ft Heater hose,This line is well made and offers great benefit when camping or using a small heater as you can place the fuel outside the tent or away from the heater and any flame. Well worth the cost and the product was shipped quickly with good service.
2,didn't work without going and buying adapters to fit my female threads,didn't work without going and buying adapters to fit my female threads. They should include adapters for all styles or say it doens't fit female threads.
2,doesn't work with VF30KBLUELP,"You may be led to believe that the hose will work with this heater because they package them together, but it doesn't have the correct fitting to install on Mr. Heater. This is made for the little disposable canister connection. Cheesy plastic knob. Aggrevating!"
3,Not a direct fit for MH40LP,"I bought this extended hose to keep the radiant heater hanging on the ceiling in my garage while allowing the tank to be a good distance away. While the POL style fitting worked fine for the 20Lb propane tank I have but the other end does NOT fit in the MH40LP gas inlet. It would've been nice to know what parts I needed before hand, now I will have to go to homedepot and do research on the parts I need or having to once again order off the internet and wait..."
4,Good quality,"Running a 12' hose for propane at the camp site made me nervous. However, this is a good quality thick hose with good solid attached brass fittings. I don't worry about people stepping on the hose or tripping on them and pulling the hose out of the fittings.The plastic thumb wheel to assist screwing the hose into the cylinder seems like an afterthought and keeps slipping off. Be nice to see them redesign that to a more permanent solution."
1,Hose and heater do not work,.In December 2004 I purchased a Mr Heater MH18B Portable Heaterand this hose to connect to a propane storage conatainer..The hose inserts into the tank and the heater smoothly. But nopropane flows from the tank to the heater. I have been unableto get even the pilot flame to light ... no gas flow throughto the heating element.A wasted $150 .... not a very happy or satisfied customer.
1,Season 1 -incomplete-,"Ok, first of all, there are 54 episodes, only 13 are on this DVD, so only 24% of the show is on it, it is also only dubbed, it sould really be both dubbed and japanese subbed, also with the bloopers, what's with the bloopers, how could an animated series have bloopers?? I think someone should come out with a DVD with the complete series on it, also with the origional japanese on it, including dubbed americain for when your eyes hurt and are too tired to read, but overall I am dissapointed, I rated it accordingly with the content, 24% of the show (about 1/4) so 24% rating (about 1 star) overall if fox or anyone decides to release the full season in dubbed and japanese subbed, I would buy it in a heartbeat, but this I will not buy."
5,The beginning of a great series,"The first 13 episodes of the first season of Digimon were not the best episodes. There were some great moments...but in general, the series improved over time. But having the DVD is great. Great picture. Great sound.I would have liked more features....but watching the episodes on DVD is really enjoyable. I wish there were more DVDs."
1,Sorry it's bad...,"Sorry, to say this but this anime series it's bad, it's boring,not intersting, it has horrible and a very cookie-cutter likeanimation, this is definetly the worst anime series that ToeiAnimation had bought us, by the way to all Digimon haters, if you wantto hate even more digimon, check out the spanish dub, .... END"
1,A vastly better series than pokemon.,Great a pokemon clone. Which sadly spawned another wave of mon titles.
4,For Digimon Fans,"Digimon Season 1 Total Digimon! is a good DVD. Digimon is a great Anime, for all thoughts that have not seen it. For all the Digimon fans wondering about what is on the DVD, here is the summary. It is EXACTLY what was on Fox Kids, with the bad breaks where the commercials would be. It is the first 13 episodes, in English only. It also has 8 Digibloopers. It is a good value, and a good thing for any Digimon fan to have. Just remember it is EXACTLY what Fox Kids showed."
3,Bits and Pieces,"I like the fact that it is in dvd format. But, wonders why they split everything up into volumes(vol.1-4) on a DVD. All of the Devimon storyline is there, but that is it. No etemon,demidevimon, myotismon, or dark masters. Its not the full season. The rest is in VHS, or whatever they released. There is no such thing as a full season DVD or VHS set. All the videos are in bits and peices. Most likely, so they can get more money. But, what is on the DVD, is good."
5,digimon should not be compared to pokemon,"i am a fan of both digimon and pokemon. pokemon is not low-brow, even if it is aimed at a younger audience. pokemon is a fun, happy, moralistic cartoon that can teach people alot of things, whether you're young or old. digimon has that same basic concept, but it adds a more realistic touch in that some characters ""die"" and it is a bit more violent than pokemon. they both are wonderful japanimations that should not be compared with one another. this DVD is great and has a really great price. well worth the money."
4,hand mixer,"This mixer is fine. I get a kick out of the storage case. It reminds me of a suitcase. I guess they provide it in case I want to travel with it. I never leave the state without my hand mixer! All kidding aside, the mixer is very powerful. The only drawback is the eject button is somewhat hard to use. The beaters don't want to eject easily."
5,It's great,I got this for my wife and she really enjoys it. It is very powerful. We haven't had any issues with it. The price is right on this one. I would suggest it to anyone.
4,Works great,Easy to use and compact. Love that it all fits in a convenient size storage bag. The ejector button for the beaters can be a little tricky but otherwise it does it's job well and it has certainly made many cup cakes since it joined our family.
4,Case too girly,"This was a gift for my older brother, who needed a little hand-held. He really liked the blender, but the case had to go!"
5,"It gets the job done, and fits everywhere","Great mixer. I prefer hand mixers because it gives me much more flexibility for my recipes and this one is very potent so you don't need to be holding it for too long, anyway. This mixer is also a excellent option for people who don't have a lot of cabinet or counter space to keep a stand mixer. The accessories are sturdy and great quality. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,It was OK but not great!,"This is an instructional video NOT an exercise routine. You will not break a sweat following the DEMONSTRATION sets. The video moves slowly from one DEMONSTRATION to the next, it just gives instructions about the sets. The OK part is, it provided allot of good advise on techniques but the tone of the Russian trainer was boring as heck and un-motivating. The two women looked very strong and made me feel very hopeful that I could achieve the same level of fitness. BUT, this video is not worth the higher than nominal cost for an exercise video!!!"
1,What a joke,"I bought this for 2 of my women friends who are beginning to use the Kettlebells. Within the first few minutes of viewing it with them I realized I had wasted my money and they fully agreed. My thought had been to get them a simple basic KB presentation. This was a mistake. Thye ""hated"" Pavel's posturing, could see the obvious stilted ""comrade"" nonsense, and the poor quality instruction. I would suggest that you save your capitalist dollars ""comrades"" and invest them in Steve Cotter's Encyclopedia of Kettlebell Lifting DVDs. That way you will have a clear, detailed American experience of proper and safe kettlebell training. My women friends are devouring the Encyclopedia and progressing rapidly in their KB skills."
5,Really an unexpected gem,"Knowing that Maclaren-Ross was to some extent the model for Anthony Powell's character X. Trapnel led me out of curiosity to this novel and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it is. I wasn't expecting something on the level of Evelyn Waugh, Maugham, or the early novels of Powell. The travails of this cynical vacuum-cleaner salesman are hilarious and surprisingly poignant. I wish Maclaren-Ross had managed to write more."
3,England between the wars - again,"This book is good in giving another picture of between-the-wars English scene. I bought it mostly because it was on the ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" list for Patrick Hamilton's books which i liked very much.Maclaren-Ross gives lots of details of British life between the wars, which is good, but it's not up to Hamilton's (or Waugh's) quality as far as human emotions are concerned. It's somewhat predictable and simplistic, the characters are rather one-dimensional.I also bought ""Bitten by the Tarantula and other writing"" by the same author, but this was not good at all to my taste, decided to drop it in the middle. Fitzgerald, Maugham, Greene already done that - only much better."
4,Anti Witches,This book has a great start and one can really feel the magic coming together and being used in away that makes sense. Unfortunately the writing doesn't hold that strong through the story but it starts strong enough to carry the story through to the end. This was probably the better of the books I have read in the series and one I enjoyed more than any of the others.But Cam seems less real in this story and the sisters more separated. And I struggle some with Sersee and reality of her character. There seems to be an issue also of poor continuity between characters in this book and prior ones. There personality's don't seem to be consistent. But still I liked this one.Although there is a lot of threats and fire breathing at the end I found it a little weak and the characters unreal. Still the writing was much stronger in this book than in the others.
4,the witch hunters,"this is like one of those a lot of food packed into your mouth episodes.a shady charachter called the witch hunter is out after the twins and all othher things magical. after crashing a movie premiere of brice's,the warlock turned movie star,he take's his post as ajanitor at cam and alex's school.weird things start ti happen, like cams friend sukari starts getting weird visions. on coventry,ileana is flipping out because brice didn't take her to the premeire.sersee,an enemy steals karsh's journal in hopes that it'll make her a favorite of his.but instead he freezes her. miranda and ileana regain almost all their powers.of course i could tell you the rest,but sorry,read up!"
3,Twitches,"This book is o.k but it fucoses on Cam a unrealistic made to be perfect charcter. In this series most of them do center on Cam even though it is supposed to be equal between the twins Alex and Cam. Cam has no flaws and shallow as I said before but Alex is real and a fun, spunky charcter another to enjoy is Ilena a fiery blond in a gray area. The story is about how their is a mortal who goes around killing witches because he was a failed protecter. at this point it contridicts itself because in the earliar book Kindred Spirits it makes Sersee sound weak but in this one it makes her sound like a powerful witch. The love between Ilena and Brice Stanley ( a thantos sympathiser and movie star) thickens.)"
3,"Useful, but suggest other resources as well","This book provides a good overview of young adult literature up to the 1980s. So if you're writing for now, I'd suggest looking for additional sources. Good writing tips though."
1,I do not recomend it,I have tried some of the recipes; they failed. Don't think that I'm a bad baker. In fact I've been baking for a long time.I feel sorry that I bought it.
1,This Does not Work,"Forget it...useless item...not at all on a par with the Balistol products...it really did nothing useful I can see, and if you really want some...I have half a dozen spray cans that I will not ever use. To be subtle(???), do not waste your money on this junk!"
4,Mostly like any other general hacking book.,This one cover almost every general aspect of IT security. Nice.
4,Computer security by one of the best!,"""Hackers Beware"" provides a solid introduction to the basics of computer security. I have attended several of the SANS sessions and Eric Cole has always impressed me as one of the fields best teachers.While this book is mainly for those newly introduced to the field of network security, ""Hackers Beware"" does offer quite abit for the more experienced system administrators. However, those of you who have been in the field for a while will find several areas that can be glossed over in favor of the more advanced sections.""Hackers Beware"" could have benefited from a more through editing job to cut down on the amount of repetitive material, but overall this is a great reference for any security professional's bookshelf.(Disclaimer: I received a free review copy from the publisher.)"
5,A must-have for every security professional,"This book will be a great addition to my library. The book is a great compilation of information on security vulnerabilities and more importantly, how to protect ourselves. Eric has a very easy-to-read style and the book flows nicely from one topic to the next. You can read the book cover to cover or just pick the topic your interested in. Great job!"
5,Beck 10-12,We love the Beck series. The plots are excellent and the acting is superb and believable. We recommend the deries to anyone who can watch and read english subtitles.
5,Breakout Pop Masterpiece,"I am a fan of old albums. I am a fan of Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson and Barry Gibb. Not that this record is all retro fluff, in fact that is what makes it one of the most beautiful things to be released this year. Subtle synth bubbles over vintage bass tones. Drum machines churn under luscious string arrangements. And under all the pretty sounds are some pretty heavy lyrics. Padellaro owes a lot to his former bandmate Joe Pernice and has seemed to whole heartedly follow him down that pop path from the alt-country leanings of their former ensemble. However Padellaro seems more approachable (if less sophisticated) and has delivered the kind of ear candy that Pernice only hints at on his solo debut ""Overcome by Happiness"". Fans of orch pop will absolutely freak over this record. At first listening, one might think the album clever and impeccably performed. After a few spins, it becomes clear that the lyrics and melodies shine far above the joyous production. Bravo."
4,More Dremel,I dont think one can have to many Dremel tool accessories. My father in-law has a bad case of what I call tinkeritise. He is always making something with his Dremel.
3,Very okay,"I guess I expected more from this tool. I really thought I would be using it for all kinds of different tasks around the house. I have found, however, that I seldom use it and that's a bit disappointing to me. It goes through the charge fast. I doubt I would repurchase, but perhaps that's just because I don't have a lot of uses for it. I suppose my advice would be to truly analyze what your needs are. Although the Dremel does a lot, you simply just may not need it."
3,What a Mess!,"While this chair is definitely sturdy, I hate trying to clean it. I see that other reviewers say it's easy to clean, but I would have to disagree. Food constantly falls between the cracks around the seat, and gets stuck in all the little joints. I have to remember to clean under between and around the chair every time, or it gets disgusting. I'm currently looking for another chair for my daughter because I just can't take it anymore."
5,great buy,"We originally purchased this chair 7 years ago, same design different colors then. After two more babies we thought to get a new portable chair for travel, the new ones come with so much more, or so I thought. I bought one with a removable tray thinking that would be nice and-no way. As soon as our daughter figured out that she could fling the tray off it was a waste of space and made a bigger mess!!!( Now she can throw all the food at once!) I miss our simple back-to-basics chair like this one. Also be careful most of the other chairs are not as height adjustable as this model. This is a great economical and reliable choice."
5,Bargain Booster Seat,"I had checked out booster seats on the Internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive. It's a bargain -- well made and easy to use. My grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair. The seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair. When I wrote customer service about the problem, they sent a whole new booster seat!"
4,Great Value!,I purchased this seat after borrowing a similar one from my daughter's therapist. It was very easy to set up and the only problem I have is sometimes the tray is hard to put on. The tray is very easy to clean and the price was good!
4,Seat is better than the others!,I own 3 of these chairs and use them instead of high chairs. They are easy to clean and great to travel with. I use them every meal and don't eat at anyone else's house without them.I've owed every booster seat on the market and find this one to be the most convienient. My only omplaint is that the latches sometimes get stuck but the tray still locks into place so it's really not a big deal.
5,Great booster seat,This has been a great booster seat. We bought one 5 years ago and used it for both kids. It folds up nice and is durable and easy to clean. We used to take it camping with us and strap it to the picnic tables. Best booster seat we ever tried!
3,Great product - bad packaging,"I love this product because it tastes good and is organic. Unfortunately, every can in my shipment was dented. It was not packaged well; however, since every can was dented I suspect it was damaged before it ever shipped."
4,Good Garbanzos,"These are tasty. They aren't mushy and aren't too hard, either. Makes good hummus. I wish that the beans were a bit sweeter and more flavorful, but they are still good. I love that these are no salt, a hard thing to find in canned beans!"
4,The only problem is flatulence,"Like all other beans (legumes), eating garbanzo beans (chickpeas) regularly would substantially lower our risk of death from heart disease, cancer, and a dozen other killer diseases. In addition, unlike red-colored, pink-colored, and purple-colored beans, garbanzo beans are very low in cancer-causing tannins. Therefore, the only problem with garbanzos is that they cause flatulence more severely than most other species of beans and peas. Eden did their job well by not adding any salt, which always contains cancer-causing nitrosamines, to these organic garbanzos."
5,Great price on Amazon,"These organic beans taste better than the non-organic versions at the grocery store. They are much cheaper through Amazon than at my local health food store, and I like that the cans are BPA free."
5,NO BPA!,Eden Organic contains NO BPA in the lining of their cans. This was such a good deal and I don't have to worry about buying beans for awhile :) Free shipping too!
2,Not a helpful book for us,"Our family got a new Great Pyrenees puppy (9 months old). We wanted one good Pyr book that helped us with some basics; feeding him and training him. On both counts this book let us down. In ""How much to feed:"" the book described how to tell if your dog is overweight and had no information on quantity of food. For training the book emphasized sending the dog to training school. Our family does not recommend this book, however our children enjoyed the pictures."
1,If I could rate it 0 stars I would,"Completely useless. Anything in this book I'd already learned from rescue sites. If I could get my money back, I would ... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Informative,"I found this and the two other books relatively helpful in understanding the breed's origin and purpose as livestock guardian dog. There are however some misconceptions in the book. The emphasize neutering/spaying the dogs, which if researched properly owners would understand how damaging it is to the dogs. Also, I wish they included info about raw diet. It is much better and healthier for the dog. Also, you need to know your dog. Too much exercise as is bad as they grow, however the dog tells you when it's tired, they fall over and just sleep. I have taken our pup for 1-2 hour walks since we got him and he is fit and healthy. No problems. Talk to your breeder, they should be familiar with their breed and be the best source for information."
5,Good Information,"I bought two books when we adopted our Pyr from a rescue clinic. We knew a little about the breed traits, that were reaffirmed in this book. Great pictures and easy to read. You will be glad you got this instruction booklet."
5,Explore the Hub -- Sci-Fi at its Best,"James Schmitz wrote well-crafted stories with strong characters. The background settings are intriguing and the stories have unusual plot twists. These volumes maintain their freshness and appeal, even after more than a quarter of a century. If you haven't met Telzey and Trigger or explored the Federation of the Hub, you will enjoy discovering this new world. (Even if you have read Schmitz' work before, it's well worth the re-visit.)"
5,A great FEMALE protagonist from an early MALE author,"Snap up this book even if you haven't met Telzey before: if you have, you'll want the new material in this edition. Eric Flint does not disappoint fans of Schmitz in this first of 4 volumes of tales of the Hub. Some PSI, plenty of action, but most of all,FUN! Definitely worth reading many times."
2,"Acceptable audio quality, but loose connections plague this cheap cable,","I bought this to hook up my mp3 & my smartphone to my car stereo which has an aux-in feature.ProsCheap price.This cable works best with my MP3, with few problems. The audio quality with the MP3 & the Smartphone is good but definitely nothing to brag about either.ConsWith my Moto Cliq MB200 smartphone, it has a lot of problems. The fit of the cable with the smartphone is not accurate & it keeps triggering the phone's voice dial feature, every time it goes over even the smallest bump. I have tried switching ends on the cable & it still does it.There is loose connection problems also with my stereo's aux-in. I have to rotate/turn the cable when its in the aux-in of the stereo, just the right way or else it give poor, low or no audio at all. This happens with both ends of the cable.Overall I am dissatisfied w/ this cable & would not purchase it again!"
2,A real disappointment,"Frankly, I expected more from LucasArts. I've played other games by them, including the N64 version of this title, and they were excellent. But the GBC version has poor graphics, poor control. It's hard to figure out what to do, and even harder to do it. The button use is unnatural, it's very easy to die with a misstep. The password save system is old and outmoded. I don't know what else to say about it. It just doesn't live up to the Indy name."
4,Good buy,"This game is way better than some ... that is released today, it has good graphics and control and the game is quite fun. It's very much like the N64 and computer games with the same type of gameplay, wich is a good thing. I mean, who wants that simpson ... anyway?"
3,"Crack that little whip Indy, and I mean little!","I did enjoy this game, but it did give me headaches. The screen is so small. You can't even see Indy's head. Actually, his hat is his head in this game. The puzzles are simillar to it's PC and N64 companions. Sometimes, you can't figure out the puzzles, and you end up running around the level for an hour looking for some way to beat it. If you are a serious Indy fan like me, you will want this game. But if you have never played the other games, and not a fan, stay away!"
2,A real disappointment.,"Frankly, I expected more from LucasArts. I've played other games by them, including the N64 version of this title, and they were excellent. But the GBC version has poor graphics and poor control. It's hard to figure out what to do, and even harder to do it. The button use is unnatural, it's very easy to die with a misstep. The password save system is old and outmoded. I don't know what else to say about it. It just doesn't live up to the Indy name."
5,Great footage and narration!,"The BBC excels again! The stories are authentic, dramatic, compelling. A great gift for those interested in the natural world."
5,WOW!,"BBC and David Attenborough do it yet again. This one follows some of natures most awesome spectacles. Hard to go wrong with material like that, but BBC still does it better than anyone."
3,1080i video and stereo audio?,"The Blu-ray version of this show is 1080i with stereo audio, which is unfortunate. Planet Earth, on the other hand, is full 1080p with 5.1 AC-3 audio.Any nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough is solid gold, as far as I'm concerned; but it's incredibly disappointing that BBC continues to lower the quality of their releases by using awful video codecs (VC1) and cardboard packaging.Luckily I was able to find a better quality 1080p version of this (after purchasing the discs) for my media center."
5,Nature's Most Amazing Events,"Excellent video and narration. Although Serengeti activities have been shown in several TV shows, this one is different than any I have seen. This is a top notch documentary."
5,Great Animal Stories !,"I watch (and buy) a lot of nature stuff. I have most of the BBC stuff. While it appears the BBC shoots in 1080i (or at least the Blue Ray DVDs are), you won't care because the photography is great and the stories are GREAT!I give these DVD's my highest rating. I watch them over and over."
5,Astonishing footage of unique events!,"I have seen many nature documentaries, aired on NGC, Discovery Channel, and the like and the films I've purchased for my family's collection (I have all of David Attenborough's films). You might think ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"" will be just another one for the DVD shelf. You would be wrong. This is a fantastic film that's definitely worth owning. The film makers have done a superb job showing these regular events in a new light. I have never seen, for example, footage of thousands of leaping dolphins on the hunt for sardines on their annual migration. By the way, we still have an old, 27-in square-screen TV! Imagine how even more impressive these footages would be on a plasma or LCD screen. This film is a keeper and one we will probably revisit time and again."
3,decent,"A lot of the footage is already in Planet Earth so if you own or have seen enough of that then I wouldn't buy this. It is interesting, we did learn a little, but the repeated scenes are getting old for us."
3,Great Blu Ray / Lousy Packaging,"Like Planet Earth, this Nature's blu ray dvd set had fantastic shots and the narration is good. The aerial and panoramic views are spectacular. Like Planet Earth, some of the video is like sd. Overall I am giving the dvd set a 4 star rating.Now to the lousy packaging. Well somebody had to do it again. The outside sleeve is standard cardboard with the standard information printed which is ok, but the inside container for the dvds is also cardboard, not the standard blu ray plastic container. The dvds slide in and out the slits on the cardboard container with difficulty. If you are not careful, you can scratch the dvds. Zero star rating here people; lets get with it."
5,"nature's Most Amazing Events""","Amazing videos of natural events one would not believe possible!! If you love nature, you'll love this video."
4,Very good,"Only 720P and the sound isn't really very good at all, Dolby 2.0 I believe, but the material is very enjoyable. I have only seen two of the episodes but was very satisfied and look forward to viewing the other episodes."
5,Nature's Most Amazing Events,I learned a lot about nayure through this video with my family. Great purchase.
4,Spectacular,Just saw this on cable. It's truly spectacular. The section on the Arctic summer makes you think about the consequences of global warming. You should also watchPlanet Earth - The Complete BBC Seriesby the same author. The photography is even more amazing than Planet Earth.
4,"Very cool, but not Planet Earth","Overall, I really like this set. I don't have problems with the packaging as mentioned by others, and I really like the behind-the-scenes that are included behind each episode. The photography is amazing, and I love getting the whole picture of each story instead of jumping from place to place like Planet Earth did (although that was part of what I loved about that series too, so go figure).My only problem with this is that several times throughout the episodes the shots are blurry--almost like they weren't shot in HD.For the price though, who can beat watching the mother seals trying to protect their babies from storms, or the humpback mother supporting her baby over their long trek, or the thousands of mating dragonflies, etc., etc. A great addition to your collection!"
1,nightmare,This was a rubbish purchase.Its a blue-ray dvd and can only be used in america.Very very disappointed.Very very disappointed.
4,MASTERGRADE RX-78-5,"AS USUAL THE BANDAI MASTER GRADE HAS GREAT DETAIL, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DESIGN OF THE GATLING GUN. I WAS HOPING FOR TRADITIONAL, BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE LIKE A RIFLE. IT SHOULD STILL MAKE A GREAT ADDITION TO MY GUNDAM MODEL COLLECTION.FOUR(4) OUT OF FIVE(5) STARS. GREAT JOB BANDAI."
4,old-time fun,"This movie is a lot of fun - a great change of pace. It's happy and easy for kids to watch. Doris Day's ""accent"" gets a bit old by the end of the movie, however."
5,This is a very entertaining movie and just for fun.,I like the stars in this movie and I enjoy the singing and the romantic story.It is a lighthearted comedy and musical which I enjoy.
5,Calamity Jane,"I've always loved Calamity Jane from the age of four! I remember dancing to the brill songs like 'I can do without you,' and 'the black hills' and 'a womans touch' and 'the windy city'. I think Doris Day is a superb actress and she can sing and act beautifullt to portray a very tomboyish Calamity Jane. She is in love with the lieutenant, but he has fallen in love with a woman called Katy who Calamity herself brought to dead wood and shared home with. After an embarrassing confrontation with Katy in the golden garter, Calamity falls for a life long friend - her secret love Bill hickock - who himself fancied Katy. It all ends happily with Katy marrying the lieutenent (I despise him!!!) and Bill marrying calamity. It's a wicked film and the songs are great! I love it and if you ever have a chance to watch it please do because it gets me hooked everytime even though I have probably watched it about 1000 times!"
4,"Whip Crack Away, Whip Crack Away, Whip Crack Away","Filled with the excitment of songs you'll never forget, a whole new generation can discover this family-loved classic! Doris Day plays one of her best roles ever as Calamity Jane; a wild cowboy-woman who roams the West. She doesn't need no man...until love blooms when least expected. Check this movie out if you like those old fashioned tales with good morals, good music, and bad bad guys."
5,Rags to Riches,"Yes, Doris Day went from Buckskin to dresses in what I think is the best musical ever made. Unmatched in charm and flawless in beauty, Doris Day is the most adorable actress that ever graced the big screen."
3,Fair,Love Doris Day's movies but this one I felt that she was overacting the part. I realize that her part in this movie called for over emphasizing but this is too much.
5,Family Movie Night!,"Pop the popcorn, open the chips, get the drinks and have a great family movie night. Everyone will be singing the songs for weeks. Enjoy!"
4,A typical Doris Day vehicle,"Doris Day was very good as a singer, dancer heroine. I loved Howard Keel as the baritone Wild Bill Hickok. Supporting cast was also great, but overall just pleasant and fun not great. Definitely a whole family movie."
4,Calamity Jane,"This is as good as I remember it. Good wholesome fun. My husband says poor acting, but, that's because he likes more modern movies."
5,biased for day,"I grew up singing along with this movie, so I'm biased. I loved the romance, the love triangle [or square?], the singing and the sassy woman named Calamity. Humerous and just plain good fun."
4,Informative and a good resource -- poor on graphics,"If you want to know the off-road routes, this is a great book. It covers many of the interesting rides with information such as where to park, length of route, severity of the slopes, and actual route guide. However, the maps take a bit of time to get oriented to, and presumes some knowledge of the area. If you're entirely new to the region, getting to the actual spots may be a problem and the book does not provide a map of New Jersey. The book could be much improved with more detailed maps -- both of the biking areas, as well as its surroundings."
5,Charlotte Mason Study Guide,"I think the title is a bit misleading. This book is a wealth of information in and of itself! I read it after I had already read all of the Original 6 Volumes by CM herself. This handy litte book by Penny Gardener is a treasure chest for anyone intersted in pursuing this method of education. It is well written in ""bite-size"" pieces and easy to read/understand. It is very compact and we are using it in our monthly support meetings with great success."
5,Gone but not forgotten,"This is an overview of Cub Koda's career- from his first garage band, the Del Tinos, to Brownsville Station, to his later solo work. Cub was at heart a real roots rocker as shown on this comp. His style was an amalgam of Bo Didley, blues ,garage, surf and some wild r&b. His only hit was ""Smoking in the Boy's Room"" with Brownsville Station in the seventies, but actually I liked his other stuff better. His solo work was raw and primitive and he could play any style with authenticity. If you covet this type of music , played with unbridled enthusiasm, I would heartily recommend it. I am sorry to hear of Cub's untimely passing last week. I will miss his column in ""Discoveries"". The roots rock music community has lost one of it's most avid supporters....Cub Koda will be sorely missed."
2,to expensive for such quality,"The switches look cool, but they don't hold up to soldering very well at all -one completely melted apart on me. The other works fine, but was still a lot over priced for the quality."
2,"Please Fix Definition for ""Good""","I ordered six books all in ""Good"" condition from five different re-sellers and this book was in shoddy shape compared to all the others. Paperback binding Title barely legible, pages very yellowed, writing and underlinings/markings all over the pages. I realize this is a ""Used"" book and should expect some wear/notes, but this one compared to the others I received was ridiculous. I would have purchased from a different re-seller if they would have categorized this one correctly as only ""Acceptable"" condition."
5,DOROTHY L. SAYERS' GENIUS GLOWS IN HER TRANSLATION OF THE COMMEDIA,"This project was her dying effort after a lifetime of great achievements in scholarship and literature. She again proves her genius here with Dante, as in her translation of the Inferno, making an intelligent translation into her contemporary and scholarly English. Incredible achievement for a woman, the first to graduate from Oxford, who wrote treatises in THeology as well as the wonderful Lord Whimsey detective series."
2,"A second to ""Scent""","Having lived abroad in Asia for 4 years, I have enjoyed Butler's ""A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain"". The fact that the author lived, ate and spoke among the natives effuses throughout his books. So my disappointment couldn't have been greater when I picked up this book. The action, which the author wants to depict as breathless is listless and the characters come across as pathetic and pitiful when they should be portrayed daring and poignant. As his earlier work, this novel confirms that the author only got better with age."
5,Propane extension hose,"This thing worked like a charm! It took just a few minutes to set up and performs flawlessly. To be able to switch from a small 16oz tank to a 20# or larger tank is a heck of a lot less expensive for(in my case), running a catalytic heater. No complaints."
5,Good stuff,I have bought Birchwood Casey Walnut Wood Stain a number of times in the past and will continue to look for it in the future. Why? It works and works well on my gunstock refinishing projects. I have tried a number of other stains and this is the best I have found.
3,new?,The listing said that the book was new but it wasn't. It has writings and higlightings parts in it
1,Avoid,"I bought these to meet the $25 minimum for free shipping. Even though these only cost me a couple of bucks, I regret making this purchase because I could've bought something of a better quality for less.I use these to apply toner. They begin to tear as soon as I apply friction and rub the pad gently against my face. These pads are quilted, and in-between each section of cotton is thin paper that, when wet, tears extremely easily. It's like they made these pads not knowing that people would wet them with a substance and rub it against their skin; that's what cotton pads are for! At the end of the day, they do get the job done, but it's annoying trying to hold a shredded pad together as I'm trying to rub it against my face to apply toner. Never again."
1,Useless,"These pads are thin & tear apart easily. They are completely useless. Buy a name brand. Better yet, go to the Dollar Store. That's what I should have done in the first place. You will get a better product there."
2,Change in thickness,"I have ordered these same bags (5 or 6 times) through Amazon for over a year now and was happy with them. They were thick. This last order was NOT the same. While the bags were listed identically and the UPC on the actual package was the same, the bag is MUCH thinner then before. It looks like I will need to find a new source for my 12 inch Broan."
5,Was perfect!,I will buys more and recommend them to many here in the 50th state...items arrived fast as described and the price was right!
1,Rack fell off.,The rack fell off while driving down the freeway. I had personally made sure everything was strapped down. My brand new Mountain Bike is ruined. Will NEVER buy this product again. I dont even know where to start.
2,Will Destroy Your Rim,"This bike rack is actually very good. Easy to install, and take off. BUT, it will destroy the rim on your spare tire. I have a Jeep Wrangler, the tires are 17""... the metal on this rack is not protected and it digs into the rim leaving very destructive marks."
5,Great buy!,"I am very pleased with my bike rack!! It came sooner then expected and works great. We have three bikes and it holds them very well. Can be a little tricky with odd shaped bikes, otherwise great buy!!!!"
3,Allen Deluxe Spare Tire Rack: Must Read,The rack composition is lite-weight and easy to install. Some of the rubber components are flimsy (they fell off right away) and the straps that hold the bike in a locked position are NOT to be trusted. The strap broke before I even took off with the bikes on the road.The straps to tie down to the spare tire are not long enough and you NEED alternate method of securing the rack to the tire. Go to Wal Mart and by tie-downs with hooks.Make sure you put a pad on the bottom rung of the rack otherwise it will rub and scratch your tire.The rack is ok for the price. I took it on a 600 mile highway speed ride. As long as you buy those extra straps and tie the bike to the rack with line and secure it....you will be ok.Hope it helps.
5,Shosho,"This Allen Bike Carrier fit perfectly on my CRV Honda SUV and I have carried my 2 bikes so easily from place to place. They fit on snug, and it is very simple to fasten them on the carrier. For the great price of the carrier and the simplicity of putting the bikes on IT IS A FABULOUS BIKE CARRIER."
4,Good rack.,"Works great with my 2011 Jeep Wrangler. I have larger 32"" aftermarket tires with large tread. It just fits. I feel if you have any bigger tires it may not work. I was skeptical that the thing would stay in place when I installed it. But I have done several trips and no lost bikes yet!I just fold it up and put in the back when I am not using it. It says it holds 3 bikes, but it seems like a tight squeeze. I have tried it with 2 adult mountain bikes and it just seems to fit fine."
5,Bike Rack for Spare tire mounting,"Fit's my 2008 Wrangler Unlimited perfectly. I was a bit skeptical that it wouldn't hold as described, but it works great."
3,"Good bike rack, but.....","The bike rack is very easy to attach to the car (Jeep Liberty). However, not all bikes can be attached to this rack depending on the shape of the frame."
3,Protect your rim!!!,"This rack handled 2 bikes perfectly for a long 12 hour ride. I read the reviews and purchased some foam to go around the bottom frame that goes against the rim, but it still broke the foam and scratched my rim. Make sure you duct tape the heck out of it or wrap a towel for added security because it will scratch your rim!"
2,Good Quality but doesn't for,"I purchased this because many people had luck using it with their toyota rav4. I have a 2012 rav4 and this DOES NOT work with the spare tire. I took the cover off, but the windowshield wiper prohibits it from sitting on the wheel fully. You can rest it at a slight angle, but it does not make full contact with the tire and then it rest the other ""foot"" on the body of the car likely wearing paint off. So much for it saying it fits this model.... I am returning this"
1,"Does not fit a 33"" spare tire.","Does not fit a 33"" spare tire not even close. Had to return. Did not say anything in description about what size tires it fit so my fault for assuming it was adjustable, but its not. If you have a small spare tire I'm sure this would work just fine."
1,Come on! Does not even fit my 2010 Jeep wrangler as advertised,"Not sure what I can say - it does not fit - it has held up 70 bucks for a long time, i had to send this package back, go to ups store and still waiting on refund. I have stock tires that came with the jeep when i bought it."
2,great if you want to scratch your rims,"This product will scratch your spare tire rim if you don't put something between it and the rim. The ""bottom foot assemly"" (lower piece in product photo that has a yellow sticker on it) is bare metal, and designed to rest against your (aluminum, chrome, etc) rim. Bad idea in my opinion. Yes it seems to hold the bike well, but rim will be cosmetically damaged in the process. I wrapped the contact point in sports tape to avoid damage to spare tire rim, but seems like a mickey mouse solution to an obvious design flaw."
3,Ok design,"A feel the quality could be a little better. I worry about my bikes on this rack falling off. Have only used once, don't think I will use again."
1,Almost caused an accident,This bike rack does NOT work! We took it on a short trip on the highway (about 5 miles). On the way home my husband secured everything and half way home the bottom straps holding it onto our car got bent and the whole thing including our bikes went flying off. We thank God no one got hit by anything. Luckily a kind highway patrol officer found us on the side of the road and helped us take our bikes home. I can't even imagine the damage this could have caused on a busy highway.
3,interferes with rear window wiper,"this seemed to be a well designed bike rack but i had a problem using it on my RAV4. the bike rack, when installed, butted up against the base of the window wiper. i regretted having to return it since it was otherwise a well designed light-weight bike rack."
5,Excellent for a '98 CRV,"This rack works great for a '98 CRV. I've put two full size adult road bikes on it without any problems. I take the front wheels off, just to ensure that they don't extend further than the right side of the car. My only minor quibble is that this rack doesn't come with any type of lock, but that was a an easy 10 dollar fix."
3,Allen Deluxe 3-Bike Tire Mount Rack,Really only mounts Two Bikes comfortably. My neighbors derailer hit my bike so he didn't want to use it. I didn't mind mounting two of mine because I'm not that Picky.Otherwise its O.K.
2,"Didn't fit well, unsecure, seems flimsy","I bought this to go over the spare on my Jeep Wrangler 2010. My tires aren't over-sized, but this carrier still didn't quite fit as it was advertised.I never felt safe driving my Jeep on the highway carrying my bike on this thing. The nylon straps unbuckle quite easily -- which is not what I was hoping for. And, you can't leave your bike on this and run into a store -- there's no way to lock the bike to the carrier or the carrier to the spare tire.The carrier doesn't hold the bike far enough away from your spare to keep it from rubbing on the rim or tire. And I had to place some rags between the carrier and the tire where it touched or it would scratch up my rim, as well.I used this carrier for a month before replacing it with a Yakima SpareTime bike carrier, which offers security locks and rubber strap downs.Kinda feel I wasted my money on buying this one first. But that's my fault. I should have thought it through more carefully."
2,Beware of Tire Size!,"I have a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited with the Altitude Package. This includes 18"" tires. This rack doesn't fit on these tires. The description needs to include what tire sizes this rack fits. Returning this."
2,2012 Jeep Wrangler,"I bought the rack for a 2012 Wrangler Sahara, a vehicle the rack claims to fit on. The rack does not fit as shown in the pictures. It sits on the tire with a somewhat steep angle upwards rather than fitting nicely over the tire. In addition, the bottom arm is not long enough and sits directly on the rim with no padding. I imagine that the rack will work ok, but I will have to buy some type of padding to avoid scratching my rim before I can use it comfortably. It is one of the cheapest racks out there, so I guess you get what you pay for. I will try to make it work, but I am disappointed that I could not use it right out of the package without causing damage to my wheel."
5,Perfect!,I got this for my 99 Chevy Tracker - works perfectly - no issues with the bike fitting or scratching anything. Looking for a solid performer and the best value this is it.
1,Do your homework!,"I had to give this 1 star because I never got the chance to use it. It looks like it would be worth a 4 or 5, but it did not fit. Sure it said it ""fits nearly all externally mounted spare tires.."", but as I found after looking at the fit chart on the box there are many vehicles it does not work with. Now I am stuck with paying the shipping because I waited so long to actually try the fit, instead of doing it right after I received it. Before you buy this go here [...] and see if it fits. It is to bad Amazon did go this extra step by posting the info."
1,Devastated...,"We set out on our journey, 5 hours away, with 3 bikes in tow. First the carrier kept sliding sideways. We got 2 hours away when that happened... Eventually, with 1/2 the family left on side of highway, my son and I headed to get some Gorilla tape which did work. The one peg kept climbing its way out of the rack to our dismay, but gorilla tape helped. We figured on buying more bungies to help support the rack to the top of our car.While away for the week, we used the bike rack ONE MORE TIME to ride a rail trail. After we finished up and put bikes back on the rack, the weight was too much for the back window and we heard a crack and saw that the back window was completely cracked from the weight of the bikes/rack. New window in and we ended up getting u-haul to install a hitch. We got ourselves a NEW bike rack at a Walmart and made it home fine.This rack LOOKED great but even after our attempts to support the rack, it still failed us..."
5,Bike Rack,"Fast shipping, great product. Very easy to put on/take off my Jeep Wrangler. I haven't tried putting three bikes on it yet but two hold very nicely. It is sturdy and great for the price I paid for it ($68)."
4,Fits spare of 2003 CRV,"I got this rack after looking at the descriptions of many on-spare racks. The reviews with the specs were favorable. I ""tried it on"" my 2003 CRV spare and it fits snugly, but watch out for the wiper on your back door. It fits, but you can't just shove the rack on. It takes some care. Removal was easy and folded up compactly.My Trek 7200 womens bike fits well and I didn't have the bike tire overhang problem from the CRV spare offset because my bikes' fork angles inward toward the car folding it neatly. My daughters 16 inch frame was difficult because I had to balance it in the rear fork and the front. She'll be growing into an 18 in frame soon which should fix this problem.I didn't take it for a spin yet, but I think for normal driving conditions this will be fine compared to my Trek sedan trunk rack (for my old Neon.). I would recomend it to other CRV owners."
1,Does not really fit a Rav 2004,It is supposed to fit a 2004 Rav4 but it really doesn't. The rear windshield wiper is in the way while installing. The spare tire is recessed into the door and there is not enough clearance between the tire and the door to get the rack seated securely. The rubber bumpers on the top hooks are not long enough to prevent the door from being scratched by metal. The cross bar in the middle rests on the outer part of the spare rim and scratches it. There is no place to securely attach the tie down straps. The rear door cannot be opened if you secure the straps under the door. There was no easy way to secure the straps around the spare itself because it is recessed into the door. I rate this rack as zero stars and have returned it to Amazon.
3,"decent enough, but watch out","For the 3 times I got to use it, it worked wonderful.Then someone stole it.They just cut the straps off that hold it on, and took the rack itself.If you just have to have a bike rack, get one that LOCKS. Go buy one that locks to your trunk or one that you can secure without a doubt...or just take it off when you're not using it.The rack itself was fine, and held the bikes just fine, so I don't have a problem with that, especially if you're trying to budget in a rack with low $. Just watch out, and don't let douchebags take stuff that's not theirs. If they try, kick them in the balls as hard as you can for me one good time. It's probably the same people. You never know."
1,Worthless Off Road,"I bought this rack to put on my Nissan Pathfinder. Installed very easily, and my 3 bikes felt secure. Was fine on the highway and interstate. The moment I got on even a slightly bumpy dirt road the rack had fallen off. Put it back on and secured it with 550 cord, and less than a mile later the bottom straps had fallen off again and the rack was drooping down only held on by the chord that I used. Save your money for a bolt on if your into mountain biking or anything besides moving your bikes from city to city on nicely paved roads."
4,Allen 3 Bike Spare Tire Rack...High recommendation !!!,"I think this bike rack would be hard to beat..especially for its moderate price. It sets up and goes on very easily ... and it feels very secure. I have not as yet put more than 2 adult bikes onto the rack at one time and perhaps 3 - especially adult bikes - may be pushing the limits. What I also like about it that I can also open the rear door without dismounting the bike - this comes in very handy ! ..and because it uses my spare tire I still have the ball hitch for other things, like my boat or trailer. This review written by my husband, Paul."
4,good rack for the price,"Good bike rack, nice secure harnesses.Cons--I live in the city and parking is tight. Gotta be careful not to bang it into the car behind it sticks out quiet a bit. I feel it can be preety easily stolen. I have kids bikes, the rack is pretty wide makes it kinda hard to strap them down."
4,Simple Set...Works Fine on Jeep Wrangler,"This bike rack is a great value, compared to Thule and others, and works perfectly well. It took two minutes to set up, works with the Jeep back door so that it still swings, and holds bikes securely."
4,easy as pie,"I was surprise that this bike rack was so easy to put on my SUV, its amazing, ""a caveman can do it"". It is not a 5 star because you have to put a foam or any thing that will protect your rim from the horizonal bar resting on the tire and it is tricky to put 2 female bikes on it. You have to play how to put it on so the bikes won't scratch each other or the gears won't mess up. I also bought a combination lock with chain to secure the bikes and the rack on my tire so I have peace of mind when I go biking .Other than these, it is sturdy , price right and recommendable. Enjoy."
3,Good but not the best.,This did not attach to my CR-V very well. It's stable but the straps aren't the most secure. It works but could be better. Good for the money though if you don't want to spend over $100 on a bike rack.
3,Allen Bike Rack,"Have not tried yet as is present for March.Arrived with box so damaged it barely stayed in box.If there was loose hardware I,ll be in trouble as purchased in Dec."
4,Rav 4 2011,I have 2011 Rav 4 and im not sure if this item will fit on the spare tire without removing the cover?
1,Misleading!! Waste of money.,"I too have a Honda CRV and cannot safely secure it to my car because it wasn't made for it!I found the product overall unreliable and unsafe. I DO NOT recommend this rack to anyone who cares about their bike or the possible risk of it falling off during high speeds while traveling. After using alternative methods to ""secure"" it into place, it still twists around and seems generally unfit to support my bike (let alone two others).The product description fails to mention that it was made ONLY for sixteen specific car models. The only place i was able to find this information listed was the package upon arrival to my home..Hope this helps someone from making the same mistake. Happy buying!"
3,Doesn't fit Rav4,"This rack is light-weight and very easy to install, but I can't get it to fit on my 2008 Rav4 without interfering with the rear wiper. I tried it both with the tire cover on and and with it off. Doesn't fit either way. It seems like a nice product, and it would probably work well on another vehicle."
2,Didn't work for me,"The item was solidly built however it did not work on my Honda CRV. The left side of the hook that goes against the car sat right underneath my rear window wiper and put pressure on it. When I placed my bike on the middle rack slot, the entire rack came right off the car. Also, the straps that hold it to the bottom of the car are not very secure as a means for supporting one bike - let alone the three this can supposedly hold. I have returned this item.UPDATE: As I went to send my package back I see on the back of it that it says it was not mean to fit my CRV. Amazon should really post it - the back of the box is really vital info when making this purchase. it doesn't fit many SUVs at all."
1,Piece of crap,"HOW has this thing gotten such great reviews?!My husband installed this on our 2007 Toyota Rav4, and various plastic components snapped off immediately. He pretty much had to jerry-rig it with duct tape & bungee cords. It didn't fit perfectly in the middle of the spare tire. It was kind of off to one side of it. We put our 2 bikes on it and worried the whole time about them falling off. After about a week, he took it off and we threw it out (but we waited too long to install it, so past the 30 return period). I can't recommend this bike rack at ALL. We just bought & installed the Thule Spare Me, which (although more expensive) I think is going to work much better. I'll review that once we have some more experience with it."
3,"Look cool, plays poorly","These are coolest LOOKING picks I've ever had. But I didn't find them that useful for playing. More basic (no graphics)and thinner picks work a lot better than this. Maybe I just got the wrong size . . LoL . . . Next time I won't get .8'sFeels like I'm playing with a brick instead of a pick.hey that's catchy , Lol"
4,1930's German bomber,"I'm building model airplanes. One of my future project will be the Dornier Do-23. I have got a great plan, but I would like to build a highly detailed one. The book will help me. I have found only this book on the internet. I only miss some colourful painting schemas. Therefore I rate this book with only 4 stars."
2,Cheapskate,"My review is not about the content of the book, but about the publisher.I bought the book and to my amazement when you flip through to Chapter 14 it says you should go to the publisher's web site and download it. I have not yet been able to do this since I am not a college instructor...."
2,"GM Auto Repair Manual (1986-1995 Buick, Olds., Pontiac)","I often found the manual more frustrating than helpful. Pictures are numbered but the number is rarely used (see illustration rather than referring to the number). A popular engine during the time span designated was the GM 2.5 L OHV. No complete picture of the engine, only partial views in the manual. The PCV valve explanation on page 1-25 is incomplete (see Chiltons). The organization of the manual could be better. A great manual for a GM mechanic but not for the back-yard mechanic. A good supplement to the Chilton's manual."
4,GM Repair made easy.,The book has excellent picture references and well thought out instructions. Wiring diagrams are well done too. The only draw back is it offers no vacuum hose diagrams. I believe it is a good book for the basic home mechanic.
3,dissappointment,"this stuff isn't anywhere close to what they make it soundif you read the other reviews then you've noticed the whole pig latin deal which means they were trying to hide somethingnot to mention, this stuff just isn't anything like regular shishatobacco shisha is much more flavorful and smooth and thick, i was disappointed when i tried this stuff : /"
3,Um..,"I mean i got the stuff early and was happy about that, however they gave me some flavors that weren't expected (black licorice, aniseed, and cardamom). I would recommend this if you like surprises because it sure as hell surprised me."
2,They sent me one nasty flavor 250g box instead...,They sent me one 250g box of golden apple flavor and it was disgusting also it tasted old. I would not buy this again....
1,Not worth,The molasses were terrible. They don't tell you the flavors online and even the quality is not good. I will never buy this item again. There are better molasses available on the website.
2,Misleading,"Images show fruity flavors. I was expecting Apple, Strawberry and mixed fruit. Instead I received Mint, Liquorice, and Apple. I hate liquorice. thanks for wasting my money..... about a month later and the seller did take care of me. They sent me additional flavors. I will caution you all though about the fact that the flavors are assorted so you don't really know what you're going to get... and so far, Apple, Mint, Strawberry, and Mixed Fruit, all pretty much taste the same... the smoke isn't thick, very mild flavor."
4,Great stuff but out of date...,"I'm a big fan of Soex herbal hookah molasses, I use it primarily. I was a little weirded out by the fact the expiration date stamped on the ones I just received were dated for November 2010 hence the 4 stars instead of 5."
4,"Good, unexciting flavors","When I placed this order I thought that I would be receicing Mango, Apple, and chocolate or something similar, this order sent me a minte, wintergreen, and coffee. Just to let people know. I am big into Hookah for the social aspect so it is all good anyways."
2,Just The Basics,This video only gives general tips on playing poker. It's too fast and straight to the point. I would not recommended this video for beginners.
2,Disappointing..,"The guide is very informative on accomendations and restaurants of any price level BUT and this is a huge BUT..the information given doesn't always show up on the LESS THAN CLEAR maps. Some of the towns aren't even on the maps provided and the ONE full color map is more like a road map instead of a detailed one that should have been included. I like the fact that it is informative about Attractions but how do you get there and where are they? Also, needs more information on the parks. I wouldn't buy this book as my only guide but as a appendix for a true tour guide of this gorgeous region."
2,Disappointment,"Although this is a great guide, most of the books are no longer in print. Had I known I couldn't buy the books I would have gotten volume II instead."
3,Gun finishing kit.,"I blued an old 22 rifle that has been in my family for around 80 years. It did a fair job, nothing to write home about. It was a lot of trouble not to turn out better than it did."
4,Quality Gun Finish Kit,"My husband was very pleased with the kit overall. He has used it several times since I purchased it for him, and didn't have any major issues or complaints with it. He was pleased with the outcome of his guns and would buy this kit again if needed. The price on Amazon was much cheaper than in any of our local sporting stores, so we are very pleased."
4,Gift,"I researched this product on the web and was impressed with others' results, that's why i bought it as a gift for my father-in-law."
2,It is ok,I got it for X-mas. kept using it just about 2 months it just stopped working I took perfect care of the peice of crap
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"This cd player is the worstest I have ever seen. I have one and it can break easily when it is dropped 2 to 3 feet to the ground. It skips a lot when I jog and It does unsuspected things sometimes. It is only good for nothing but only using it at home on a desk. It only has 40 sec. of skip free protection. It will not last long, but You can buy it if your only going to use it at home on a table or something that doesn't shake too much. You many spend 5 more bucks just to get a better cd player. I suggest not to buy it."
1,this sucks,BEWARE! this thing is not worth the money! it breaks easily. im on amazon looking for a new cd player because this stupid piece of crap broke. for 50 bucks you can find a much better cd player that is more reliable and has better features.
4,durable player,i got this player for christmas 3 years ago since then i have dropped it many times it still works great never skipped on me good sound but now i have a new cd palyer the irock bling it is a little more bulkier than this but works good this is a good player
3,pretty good,"i find this product to be pretty good, except that as stated before by others, it does seem to skip. also, most of the time i have the have the volume on at 25 (which is max) and i usually still can't hear my music all that well. other than that, it is a pretty good cd player. when you in the middle of a cd and put it back in it will start where you left off, and i especially enjoy that."
1,Brian is right...,"This CD player has so many problems...I thought I was the only one who had a defective one. It skips while jogging so much that I now have it sitting on my desk. It's fine for that but nothing else. Yes, sound quality is good. The batteries do not last 20 hours...I was lucky to six hours before the battery indicator icon came on. It would shut off in the middle of a song for no reason at all. Very annoying buttons that worked sometimes others times not. As I said before, I now have this CD player on my desk in work hooked to the wall outlet so I don't spend a fortune on batteries. Not recommened at all. Panasonic dropped the ball on this big time."
5,My review,"I purchased the Herbal Heating Shoulder Pad & I LOVE it. It smells wonderful, but, above & beyond that it works. It helps with the pain & helps to relax the muscles.It is awesome & I would def buy from this seller again. Arrived super fast, in great shape, packaged well & just as secribed by seller!!!"
2,Didn't last too long...,"When I first received the product and installed it, it looked great! Unfortunately it only lasted approx. three weeks. I believe it's a problem with the transformer. I only had one light hooked up, it stopped working, so I switched lights and that one doesn't work either.I don't know how to rememdy this problem? Any suggestions..."
4,"They are Hot, but not really Hot Pants","I got these for my girlfriend and we both love them. Good quality, good fit, good price -- sexy!. But I would not recommend wearing them outside unless you want her to get arrested or molested. These are more like underwear, very revealing -- the pink was practically see-through!"
4,well made and durable,"My son, now 4 years old, has received the new Hess Toy Truck every year for his birthday. However, as he was born on Christmas Eve, 2004, he did not recive that year's edition. We were able to purchase the 2004 model from an Amazon third-party, at a reasonable price. It was shipped quickly, packed very well, and received in mint condition. We are playing with it already (in direct competition with many Christmas gifts), and it is one of his favorites."
5,Hess truck,The truck arrived promptly and was in mint condition! It is a wonderful addition to my Grandson's collection.
5,Added to Hess Collections,Yet another Hess vehicle added to my nephew's collection. Great quality and wonderful vendor to work with. I am not sure just what I will do when I have purchased all the past trucks in the collection.
4,Hess sport utility truck with motorcycles,"Great toy, my 2 boys love it disappointed the batteries are already done with the motorcycles and can't figure out how to put new ones in."
5,well presented information,I am thrilled with this book. I would eat and enjoy every recipe. It is helping me to understand how to balance a vegetarian diet. It also caters for vegans etc.
4,Vegetarian Cuisine,"This is an excellent source of recipes for non-meat meals. They all sound delicious and I'm looking forward to trying them out.The book was in good condition when I received it, my only complaint is that it was missing about 5 pages, so I'm missing 10+ recipes from the book."
5,I cook from this regularly!,"I focused anew on healthy foods a few months ago, and several recipes from this cookbook are in my ""regular rotation"". They are very tasty, easy to fix, and call for easy-to-find ingredients. I like the page lay-out of the book, too. I have lost over 25 pounds in 4 mos without ever going hungry or ""dieting"". When my doctor's nurse called to tell me about the improvement in my blood lipid panel, she added, ""We rarely see so much improvement."" My favorite recipes (paraphrased titles which I am copying from the back of my meal-planner) are:sweet-and-sour tofu with broc & pprs, p. 261curried tofu w fruit & quinoa, p. 345hoisin & black-bean stir-fry w carrots, pprs, squash, snow-peas, p. 137caul & raisin curry w chickpeas, p. 260"
4,"Great, delicious easy meal.","This cookbook is filled with easy and inexpensive recipes. The recipes center around a vegetarian kitchen that relies on staples such as pasta, beans, grains, etc. Even if you don't usually have these things on hand, they are easy to find and inexpensive.Most recipes are hearty and enjoyable for vegetarians and non-vegetarians a like. My only complaint is that of the hundreds of recipes, there are pictures of only a fraction of them."
1,Flavorless recipes,"I was really disappointed in the recipes in this book, especially after reading so many positive reviews. After trying about 5 or 6, I have found most of the recipes are lacking in flavor - the last one I made didn't include any seasonings and didn't even call for the addition of salt or pepper! If you are new to vegetarian cooking like I am, or just new to cooking, and will need to follow recipes exactly, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you are looking for some basic recipes you want to play around with to build your own vegetarian specialties, this book may work for you."
4,Nice saw but,"If light weight and less noise sounds good to you this is a great saw. But mine came with no paperwork (instructions, warranty card, etc.) or blade change tool and Amazon never followed though."
3,"Nothing new, but overall a good album","Let me start by saying I've been a fan of Metropolis Records for many years now. I was looking for some new music and picked this album up the other day. This project features Sebastian Komor from Icon of Coil, and Richard Bjorklund of Spektralized. I've never really listened to either of the original bands, so I didn't know what to expect. After listening, I was impressed. They haven't done anything new sound wise, but the combination of modern synthpop, and EBM sounds great. The vocals sound very much like Depeche Mode meets Apoptygma Berzerk, VNV Nation, etc; If you're looking for something that sounds 1985ish mixed with modern EBM, then you should enjoy this album."
4,very nice synth-pop,"I don't understand also why some reviewers are saying this sounds like IOC. This is pure synth-pop, not EBM at all, tough it's got some energetic songs. This is not aggressive or harsh synth pop either, it's quite melodic, dance-y and nice. It has some dance oriented songs and some others more relaxed and deep but not cheesy or boring at all. Overall a great synth pop (I say again: synth pop) experience."
3,Alright,this cd kinda dissapointed me.. i was expecting more. this cd is entertaining if your a fan of Icon Of Coil. But other than that i dont see much to praise this cd about.. Sounds just like icon of coil to me.
5,Partners In Autisms Spectrum Pick,Groundbreaking book for the layperson and professional alike. Defines and outlines the characteristics of the syndrome also referred to as Higher-functioning Autistic Disorder. The book provides a professional synopsis of Aspergers and its profound effect upon the lives of those living and dealing with it.
5,Hart of Dixie,"Excellant shipment. Am very pleased with the DVD set, I watch this show every week including the reruns. It is very funny. Glad to own the set."
2,Dissapointing,"Rachel Bilson is charming and has good comical timing, but this show is just not for her! It seems slow-moving and has about 5 disasters come up in the pilot . It's cheesy. Bilson needs to be on another show"
1,dont bother,"if you are under 12 years old this might spark some interest, otherwise I wouldnt waste my money. Cant imagine how they actually managed to make 22 episodes of this"
5,Really Cute SHow,"This is a really cute show. It is different than everything else on TV, and a nice change of pace. Looking forward to season 2."
4,Love this show!,I had never heard of this show before I saw It available for my kindle fire and I decided to try watching it. It's an amazing show! Too bad I have cablevision and no longer have the cw so I can't watch the new episodes!
5,one of the best tv shows they have come out with,I just recently started watching this tv show and i have to say its amazing its heart warming right down to earth well worth your money
4,Southern belles,"Funny and entertaining! Love the southern atmosphere, all the festivals, and the medical problems they have. The small town relationships are to funny."
5,GREAT SHOW,"I love Josh Schwartz's creations, Hart of Dixie is a jem! It is a charming and funny and extremely entertaining."
5,The heart of Dixie,thank you for having this episode online so it could be streamed. The quality was very good and enjoyed it very much
1,The Illuminator,"I purchased an item that appears to be the same. Crank type flashlight with 3 LEDs. Made in China is all that is marked on the unit. I can't find the instructions now. Bought to keep in the car in April of 2009. It won't stay charged at all.It is not bright enough to find anything over a about 2 feet away, and you better hurry before it runs down.A real POS! I purchased it locally through an Alco store. It may be a knock-off. The ones from Amazon.com may be OK, but mine is JUNK."
2,"Bland, dull, uninspiring","I like Therion quite a bit. Perhaps not as much as I have in days past, but they are still up there. That said, this album was a complete bore to me. It lacks the sheer depth of Deggial, nor is it as interesting and catchy as Secret of the Runes. Absolutely nothing stood out for me at all. If you like Therion, you will probably like this album alright, but it just doesn't cut it for me, I'd much rather pop Deggial, Theli, or even Vovin in the CD player than this one. If you are looking for a first album from Therion, Theli would be better if you want something faster paced and heavier, and Deggial if you want someting slower, more dramatic, and darker."
3,Seeking refinement,"Therion does operatic metal in a more dignified manner then many offshoot groups who sound more like a parody, though some of those less flattering qualities always end up creeping into these heavyweights work as well. They are a group, in my ears, whose reach exceeds their grasp, often hinting at glory but becoming bogged down in routine. Much on the discs is of a certain quality, though few tracks manage to combine these metallic/choral counterweights effectively as, say the last track on the second disc, one of the groups few attempts for their ""perfect song""."
4,breed is Psychopathic,any juggalos that love gangsta rap will enjoy this album period. I wish he did more with Psychopathic. I cant think of a better artist for Hatchet House. R.I.P.
2,Who is this guy & why is he on Psychopathic?,"Well me, being the curious juggalo that I am, decided to give MC Breed's 'New Prescription' a chance. I don't really understand why this guy is even on Psychopathic. I think he's average as a rapper (sounds really old) & he has no ""standout"" qualities. Esham makes an appereance on the disc which is probably the only reason I kept it. I cna see this dude on another label...on a hip-hop label...but NOT on Psychopathic.Beware juggalos, this guy has nothing to do with anything on Psychopathic."
4,"Somber, elegiac...","Enjoyed this very much. Again, this is one of those films that won't work for you if you've only grown up on typical Hollywood fair. This has it's own tempo and visual language. It's best viewed with an open mind. Trust the filmaker and relax and enjoy/learn from this documentary. At times its touching, sad, enlightening. This isn't just about people surviving as scavengers. That's some of it, but it's also about people making art from left objects/trash, and some have philosophical views on the waste our society produces. Also, I really enjoyed the asides about the filmakers aging. There is an elegiac thread woven through this, a homage to aging which is both somber and clear-eyed. I highly recommend it."
5,as touching as ever,"Agnes Varda is so clever and unique in dealing with this unusual theme. This work is as beautiful as other works of Varda, her camera lens will take you to those scenes which you never notice but will be deeply moved. With graceful and lithe tempo, you'll follow her into a trip you never know."
1,Complaint,"I ordered this DVD from Australia, and asked it to be sent to an address in Australia, so obviously needed a DVD that can play in Australia - yet when I went to recently play this DVD I received the message 'wrong region' ! I would like either a refund or a DVD that CAN play in Australia!!I should also mention that the casing for the DVD was damaged when I received it."
2,Not horrible...if there are no other options...,"First of all, the cookies are very tiny. Any normal, fat-laden cookie of the same size will still have a similar calorie count and actually taste good (so you're better off with something like Archer Farms or Grandma's). I bought these for their low carbohydrate content, but if you are not a diabetic, it is better to go without a cookie than to have these."
3,The Big Show,"While you might discount this as a typical ""Singing Cowboy"" movie, typical of the early Gene Autry types, this might be of interest from a historical point of view in containing many scenes showing how Fair Park in Dallas appeared during the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition, something of a typical World's Fair in the Depression years. Acting varies from the hammy to actually not bad. Some of the usual action scenes. Overall, interesting, with some fairly good songs. Look for an unknown guitar player, Leonard Slye, with the ""Sons of the Pioneers"".....better known in later years as Roy Rogers."
4,A must read for those who need to know more!,"Definitely recommend this book for those who need to know more about the JFK assassination. I felt that some areas covered in the book weren't really necessary, just filler. Otherwise a very enjoyable read."
5,"Gwar, Need I say more","One of their best albums. It's Gwar, If you don't know them, you wouldn't understand. If you're a Gwar fan you won't be dissapointed."
3,Not the greatest but still a must for any true Gwar fan,"Most of Gwar's CD's are better than this, but still it is worth the money (Everything of Gwar's is worth the money). The Original Krak-Down can be found here, as well as the really cool version of Captain Crunch (superior to the Hell-o version). The Have you seen me at the end is long and hilarious and if you listen to is all the way through you're rewarded with a quick, bizarre song at the end."
5,Nate & Hayes,"This is a great action movie which for some reason didn't make too much of an impact in the theaters. It is full of action, adventure, unexpected twists & humorous dialogue. I highly recommend it for all ages who enjoy a different kind of pirate tale."
4,"A fun, consistant adventure film","A modern pirate film that pits the good honorable pirate Bully Hayes against the truly bad, self-serving pirate Ben Pease. This film takes place at the end of the sailing ship era as steam powered ironclads make an appearance as the German empire attempts to gain a foothold in the south pacific.A fun adventure with mild blood and the required violence expected in this type of movie."
5,Just Good Fun!!,"I really enjoyed Nate and Hayes from the first time I saw it. I got this movie on laser disc back in the early 80's when I was stationed in Pearl Harbor in the Navy. There was a Bar called ""Bully Hayes Place"" we used to go to. I made sure I had a copy of the movie so I could always show my friends. If you like Action and Adventure this is a can't miss. I have watched it with my friends over and over and was thrilled to be able to get it on DVD."
4,Family connection,"It wasn't as I thought it would be - a story of Bully hayes' life - it was a short span, I expected more. Besides which I had to get the DVD decoded to play in this country. But it was a good pirate-style film with action to keep you awake. The reason I bought the film is because Bully Hayes married my great-great aunt."
5,Nate and Hayes,The video is a great old movie in great condition. Highly pleased with the condition and the speed with which we received it.
5,Nate and Hayes,I happen to LOVE this movie. Tommy Lee Jones-deliver lines like no other. Good story line and FUN-just a fun movie. Remember those??
1,not good!,"brightness fades in and out. extremely annoying, i watched it for about 30 minutes before i had to turn it off."
3,Great Family Fun,"I stumbled upon Nate and Hayes in the discount section of my local movie store. I like Tommy Lee Jones, so I thought I would give it a shot. The movie had action, adventure, and romance. At times it made me nervous. It was great fun to watch. I always recommend it to my friends, I think you would enjoy it too."
4,"Simple, effective, decent capacity","My parents bought compost containers similar to this many years ago. They are simple to setup, move, and use. My only complaint is that this particular product was more expensive than I would have liked."
2,compost bin,The idea is great but the unit came with no instructions and I felt it needed extra fasteners to hold it together- either that or I assembled it incorrectly. quality of the piece (metal) is good.
2,Way overpriced,"Very basic; if you have any skill at all, you're better off building your own compost bin--it will be much cheaper."
4,Best on the market,"I have been using this product for several years and find it to be the best of its kind. It doesn't have an odor like many of the other root coloring sticks and is easy to apply. My only wish is that they made it a little closer to my own color. The light brown which I buy is a little too dark and the dark blond, a little too yellow....but overall, a very good make."
1,"Decent Product, TERRIBLE Customer Service","I ordered the ColorMark product at the suggestion of my hair stylist, to touch up a few *ahem* silver roots. It took FOREVER to get it (maybe a tactic so that I will need more?), and when it finally arrived, it was the Auburn, NOT Dark Brown. The reciept stated their ridiculous return policy (something like it must be returned within 14 days, unopened, etc), but their was NO information ANYWHERE about how or where to return it. There was no phone number, website, address, nada!! So in a moment of sheer desperation just days before my upcoming dye job, I used it anyway. The product worked well and was easy to use...my reddish roots looked a bit strange, but it was better than gray. I REALLY want one in MY color, but I dare not waste another $20. Boooo!"
5,I love this product,I have tried other products that do not go on and stay on like this one...It makes it possible to color my VERY white roots...in between color and highlighting...I get it in blonde..several colors to look like my highlights.
4,Great cover up,I have been using this product for a year now. Great for in between colorings. Two problems though - smells a little odd and if you work out and start sweating - don't touch that area because it will bleed thru. Don't touch any towels either because it will stain.
5,Color Mark Gray Gone,It's great. The color blends in well and it works just as well as the more expensive name brand. I recommend this product
4,works nicely,"Pretty easy to apply. It doesn't easily come off after it dries so no embarrassing black on hand, pillowcases or anything else. Washes out with water. Only thing is it's a little pricey for what you get."
2,Dried out,I think that most of the color in my tube had dried up. The color was good and it was easy to apply. There just wasn't much in the tube.
2,"Great Selection, terrible mixing","No doubt at all the Juan is a great selector of tunes and a great techno artist, but his mixing on this album is not slightly bad, but down right anoying. I cannot believe he sent this out to press. OK, so he hasnt used any software to mix them, but if your gonna produce a mix album on two turntables, at least know how to use them."
4,Classics from the master,"4 Stars for quality of track selection, -1 star for sloppy mixing... you should get this though. Put it in your CD player (or on your TT) and get yourself educated. The vinyl version is unmixed so you DJ's can collect all those classics (and that yummy instant-classic Maurizio track). The 'top 500' reviewer who said Sharevari is ""cheeze"" obviously does not understand the roots of Techno. Sharevari is actually one of the reasons I have this album on CD and vinyl. Don't pay attention to those who don't understand... pick this up today."
3,DiDi 25 Belgium,It's funny to know that Juan Atkins is more adored in Europe than in his own Detroit. I think it's sad that the early techno artists had to fight for over 10 years to be recognised in the US. As a Boccoccio-infected (Belgians first house-temple that only played house-beats all night long)25y old guy I appreciate this CD very much. If you're into techno you'll love it. I prefer on the other hand more the uplifting 100% House DiDi Cata 4ever!!!
2,two novels in one,"The authors seem to be very well meaning,just not very informed about mythology.Materialistic Sidhe is pretty much a contradiction in terms.Only the Irish Lepricons seem to be preoccupied with gold:the elves and the little people are more involved in trees and forest lore.Here there are two parts:1) the cult2) the child abuseThe changeling myth is that the Sidhe stole babies andreplaced them with lessor constructions/beings.Not that the Sidhe cared that much for children,but that they liked to play mean hurtful games with humans.It is a long stretch to race drivers and mechanics who rescue children in distress! The novels were kind of funny besides being very violent.These myths have been twisted around a lot over time:this is just one of the mostly ""unlikely""that I've run across."
2,Doesnt Work Well,"Recognizes the existence of studs about half the time I try to use it. I can scan the same wall twice and find 2 different pattern of studs. AC mode doesnt work, it tells me their is live AC in a wall with no wiring at all. Overall, stick with hammering nails in the walls or banging on the wall to find the studs. I was thoroughly disappointed with this product."
3,Review,The repeatability of this instrument is very questionable. Repeating the sequence for determining the location of a stud results in the stud being at a slightly different location. The stud obviously does'nt move however the stud finder shows that its not in the same identical spot.For that reaon I'm not to happy with this piece of equipment.
1,Useless.,"Just purchased the Zircon Multiscanner i500. In ""Stud Scan"" mode, I get a ""Restart at new location"" message almost all the time. Occasionally it might detect one edge of stud, and hasn't yet found both edges. Not once. In ""Stud Deepscan"" mode, it doesn't detect anything at all. In ""AC Scan"" mode I ran it all the way around a light switch and it detected nothing. This could be the most useless product ever. Don't waste your money. FYI - I built these walls and know there are studs at 16"" spacing, no insulation, standard sheetrock."
3,"Decent product, just need to spend time with it; stud finding is a bit more art than science","Decent product, just need to spend time with it; stud finding is a bit more art than science. Have used it for about 3-4 years and I just don't count on it 100 percent. And yes, you do have to go over an area 2-3 times. Tester holes with a drill can help, just go easy. Until I hear of something better, it's the best type of this device I have come across."
2,"Not accurate, what else matters?","Studs move every time you scan them, and don't even try the A/C or metal scans. Per the copy I have, I have A/C lines and metal everywhere, even when I scan standing in the middle of a large room. The only reason it gets any stars is that with repeated scans you can get an average of where a stud is with ""Deep Scan"" when used with my standard sheetrock walls."
1,Don't waste money,"I brought one at Target clearance for $12. It meant to replace our wood stud scanner, which is in his last leg. Turns out our last leg stud scanner is still out better the this Zircon one. This Multiscanner only displays ""restart in another location"" and nothing else. Too late to return, what a waste!"
1,Re-imbursement,This is the reason reason that I do not likeRe-imbursements.They never send it to you.
4,Good baterry,"This battery is only good for emergencys, since it only last like an hour and 45 min, but I cant ask for more since that is what the specifications that came with the laptop said that it would last"
2,Goof Proof Grammar is not Bullet proof,"This book is extremely condensed, and contains all the essential elements of grammar. The problem is that it is not very well laid out. I would instead highly recommend ""Write Right!"" by J. Venolia"
4,Good shows on controsial topic,I like this video. It both interesting show on controvial subject. This show bring up the debate whether their is a beast in the Loch. Nova is really good show. It maybe not the best but is still interest. Whether or not Nessie exists.
4,Bob Dylan's Spiritual Journey,"Bob Dylan is a wizard with words. But his life is almost as interesting as his compositions, especially his spiritual life. Scott Marshall takes us on a tour of Dylan's spiritual life. His thesis seems to be that even though Bob is a seeker of truth, he is still a Christian after all these years. He highlights interviews that Dylan has given through the years, from the Sixties all the way to the present day.However, when you read a Dylan interview, you never know whose answering the questions; the real Bob Dylan baring his soul, or Dylan the icon, or Dylan the whatever. Bob seems to enjoy being masked and anonymous, so I think it is tenuous at best to make a firm conclusion based on his interviews.I think Dylan has gone back to the Judaism of his youth, and so I disagree with the author. Yet I also appreciated the fascinating journey that this book takes you on. Dylan truly is a restless pilgrim, and Marshall's book is faithful to its title. Recommended reading."
3,Only Part of the Story,"""Restless Pilgrim: the Spiritual Journey of Bob Dylan"" tells the story of Bob Dylan's spiritual journey between Judaism and Christianity as if that were the whole story. Anyone who has followed Dylan's life and career can tell you Dylan is a man of many parts, but Scott Marshall, and Marcia Ford give us only two, and though the parts are interesting and well documented these 196 pages could have lost half their length without sacrificing anything of what we're told. Dylan has been alive for 61 years, and producing for about 40. He's hung out with beatniks, hippies, druggies, meditators, artists, poets, and musicians, and probably all stripes of seekers and believers, and I find it hard to believe his spiritual wanderings and wonderings were restricted to Judaism and Christianity. There must be more, and ""Restless Pilgrim,"" would have been a much more interesting book if the authors had dug a little deeper. As it is, it's an enjoyable read, but doesn't give us much depth."
2,too much propaganda,"Very interesting subject, but as I got farther into the book, I noticed that some of the reference Bible verses and quotes were starting to last over a page. I soon came to realize that the book was published by a Christian publishing company (Relevant Books). I learned more about ""the sermon on the mount"" than I did new information about Bob Dylan. ""Restless Pilgrim"" included some interesting facts, but was definitely written from a point of bias."
3,can't hear a damn thing until !,I got this tryed It and it sucked. Until I drilled a small hole where the motorola logo is by the ear speakers. works great now. why would they have not thought of this? UHHHH!!!!!!???
1,Fragile Plastic,This is a protector that will work for about a week. As in my case. You get what you pay for. I can't complain for a penny. Not for everyday use. I used this with a belt holder and it cracked in the holder. Go for a soft plastic protector to resist shock.
3,Half Dissapointed...,"This case does look to be really good and it will make it so the back of my phone never looks oiley and gross.I didn't have any problems with the case blocking my motorola branded charger, usb cable, or headset.However, I didn't look carfully at the picture of this case.I thought the plastic went over the screen and dipped dipped in when the keyboard started.In fact, there is a hole over the screen too.My main reason for getting this case was to save the screen, but...Even though this case doesn't do that, It will still be very useful for many situations that may break or scratch my phone."
3,great starter pack,This product offers alot of punch for the price. the only complaint i have with it is The rechargeable battery did not work upon arrival. :( It was the major reason i bought this one. Turns out the batteries were rusted on the inside.
2,Hide 'em in your Heart,"Great way to teach children scripture.I use these when telling Bible stories to my preschool class, the songs compliment the story.I also play it as background classroom music."
5,Great Bible Songs!,"I remember listening to these songs over and over as a child, and I'm glad to hear my 2 year old ask to listen to ""more Steve Green please!"" These songs are a great way to teach scripture to young children. My 2 year old already knows the words to several songs."
2,Some Good Facts and Background but Tedious,"Railroads and Clearcuts is a useful reference for facts on the railroad land grants of 1864. The facts are spread through some repetitive essay-like chapters that, to me, never seemed to get to a point. It is obvious the authors' concern for the Pacific Northwest Forests and their absolute disdain for Burlington Northern and anyone who bought land from them yet, somehow, the message was superficial. There has got to be a better book on this subject out there.There are a couple of good reasons to use this book. One is the timeline in the ""photographic essay"" section in the middle of the book. The second is to get a feel for how the land checkerboard was created and morphed into what it is today. If you don't know what the ""checkerboard"" is, start with another book."
3,Railroads and Clearcuts,"I bought this book looking for a history of the Northern Pacific, and was somewhat disappointed. To be sure there is the history of the railraod and the land grant that created it, but it is more of a polemic on the ecological impact of the land grant.The authors want more to get congress to overturn the land grant issue rather than explain the history of the railraod and the affect the land grant had on the area. Even if they wanted to get their environmental message across, doing so with solid history and empirical data would have been much more effective. Instead, what they produced is more of a rant about the injustice of it all.Again, there have to be better histories of the NP out there, this book isn't it."
3,Unique,What a unique musical. Awesome cast and a great listen for anyone who is involved in music theatre.
1,Eh..,"As much as I like Wendy's blog (although it's become a bit boring lately), this book really fell short. Black and white photos of some rather blah patterns. Did I mention black and white bad photos? Had I peeked inside and saw that before I bought it, I would have put it back on the shelf."
1,Disappointing,"Wendy is known as quite a talented and prolific knitter. This book, unfortunately, does not showcase her talents and there is absolutely nothing inspiring about it. Fortunately, I did not pay for the book and was happy to pass it on to a charity works bookstore."
3,Ok Read/Ho Hum Patterns,"I was disappointed in this book. Although it was a cute book to read, it is nowhere as interesting as The Yarn Harlot's Books, and the patterns were nothing special at all, as far as I am concerned. The patterns showed very little imagination, and the sweaters were shapeless and baggy.You have your basic socks, your plain pullover, your shortsleeved sweater, a sweater with a little bit of cabling, and, oh, look, a cat bed with novelty yarn. There is a vest, a lace shawl, an easy ""Norwegian"" sweater.Nothing here you can't find online someplace for free."
5,Wendy Knits,"This is a delightful book full of interesting information and patterns, as well as biographical information on the author. Wendy is a lovely lady who has a very entertaining blog. I would recommend this book to any knitter of any skill level."
1,Baby Milesones Book,"Low ratng is only because the book was out of stock, so I never received it, but I got a credit with Amazon."
5,Fram PS8132,"Great replacement for OEM, replaces much easier and cleaner. All you have to do is switch out the water in fuel sensor."
1,Bad,"This is quite possibly the worst game that I have ever played. It was incredibly complicated yet very dull. It's hard to make sense of what to do even with a strategy guide. SOme people may like it though, so don't buy it, rent it, like I should,ve done."
2,Eh.,"It's ok. Could be better. I would give it 2 and a half stars, but in this life, I don't round up.Well, I suggest renting first."
3,O.K.,"The game starts out good. It's pretty interesting, the graphics are good and being able to cast spells yourself is pretty cool. But then it seems to go down hill. The dungeons get repetetive and there aren't the many creatures to choose from. But as you go along everyone in the game hates you and it starts to get boring. It is very hard to find any guides if you get stuck as well."
2,Pokémon is better.,"The unfortunate problem with this game is that is that the capture system is a bit more random than in Pokémon. There's very little one can do to ensure the type of Infused Animite that one gets from a battle. Battling to gain experience is difficult when one needs to move on to the next area to level up fast. The single energy battle system means one cannot use up a creature's special attacks and expect survival. Fortunately the inns are free. The story line feels bland at some points. For someone who is good with strategic battling, this might be worth a look. But for true RPG fans, its either to dull or too frustrating. This game is either too easy, or too hard."
3,Fun Game,"A fun neat game that can use up a few hours of your day. Its sorta like pokemon, with monsters that fight each other. Its hard to beat like all RPG's. Its a good buy but there are better games out there."
5,The Cute Guy On The Cover,"The only reason I picked up this game was because the guy on the cover was real cute. (I also needed a new RPG for my gameboy.) So I turned on the game and wow! It was amazing not only was Tony really cute but the graphix were fabulous, the story plot was superb and there was actully humer! (Something I find gameboy games to lack.) One real great thing about the game was that it had the best elemants from Dragon Warrior, Pokemon, Zelda and numerous other games. It also had a spin of its own that sets it apart from any other gameboy game. If you have a gameboy then you have to pick this one up. (You can find it by the cute kid on the cover!)"
5,Renovo Ultra Proofer on BMW 3 series,"I used Renovo's Cleaner and Ultra Proofer on my BMW 3-series. The 500ml bottle was just enough to do the top, with a couple table spoons (20ml or less) left to spare. The top absorbed water before, and it beads now. Starting in the morning, I was able to clean the top with the first product, mask off the car and start applying the ultra-proofer. I left it in the garage for about 12 hours and drove it the next morning. If I can recommend anything, it would be to use plastic to mask the car rather than news paper. The ultra-proofer absorbs into (through) news paper. The product did not change the appearance of my black top, which was a concern of mine going into this. After having done it, I will do it again. As they recommend, I will do it again toward winter to protect the top from salt spray."
4,An honest and a true democrat,"A transparent and honest account, coupled with a feasible strategy for the future of Iran from the head of one of the most nationalist Iranian families. H.I.M. Reza Shah II is another example of Pahlavi's visionary and attainable aspirations for the Iranian nation."
1,Thanks for nothing,"Here's a book by the son of Iran's former dictator, about how to establish democracy and freedom in Iran. Need I say more?Well, ok. Let's not forget that this individual has been since childhood educated in posh swiss schools, and he has actually spent only a small portion of his life in Iran. And that he has been living it up in the US since the revolution, preoccupying himself with such crucial endeavors such as indulging in 'haute cuisine', thanks the the billions daddy stole from the people of Iran, while refusing to even lift a finger to contribute his share and improve the lives of millions of Iranian expats the world over.As for the book itself, what a waste fo time!!! You will not easily find another load of empty and self-important jarble somewhere else."
1,Hot Air From an Intellectual Desert,"While it is easy to agree that Iran is worse off under the Islamic ""Republic,"" it was also very bad off under the ""constitutional"" monarchy of the late Shah. Under the Shah, amnesty international gave Iran the distinction of having the worst human rights record on the planet.Iran doesn't need the input of a wastrel Pahlavi who had never led anything in his life. The ""dynasty"" goes back to his grandfather who ousted the centuries old Qajar dynasty and crowned himself Shah. Up until then, he could barely feed his family. Reza's father, the late Shah, went hungry as a child, but he made up for it by ripping off the Iranian people for millions when he wasn't busy brutally suppressing dissent.What Iran needs is a good constitutional government that separates Church and State and separates judicial, executuve, and legislative powers of government."
1,Waste,"The question is that why is Reza Pahlavi writing about the future of democracy. He has no experience in running a country or even a ""Viable"" political faction. He has not struggled to forward any cause but his own. He has also forgotten that his father was totally against any political freedom and brutally and consistantly squashed it. I do not consider myself a Monarchist nor do I support the current regime or any of its religous branches inside or outside the country but he is the least qualified of all the people to write such a book.The unfortunate issue is that all parties (left or right, religous or monarchist) have only one and only one reason to appeal to the masses of iranians, and it is to rule and Pillage the country. It is sad but true."
4,A Wind of Hope,"As a Pakistani, I am very concerned about what is going on in my region. While everyone in this world seems to be worried about Ben Ladin and Mullah Omar, there are only a few who can still remember that Islamic terrorism, fundamentalism and anti-Westerners ideas began with the Revolution of Mr. Khomeiny in Iran. The rest is only the consequences of what started in Iran!Now, with Reza Pahlavi, as the future king or President or even a simple future political figure in Iran, it seems that the future could be more promissing for our region. I believe that everyone who is concerned about the future of this region has to read this book and the International Community should take Mr. Pahlavi's words very seriousely and assist him to succeed.Once again, Iran is becoming the ""Spiritual Mother"" of our region!"
1,Talking about future without talking about PAST!,I can't understand why PAST INCIDENTS are neglected by writer. There are many facts that are disorted and it seems the writer is worry about something. I hope he will become brave and mature enough to face realism and historical facts.
2,The lingering question,"If the author had become the Shah of Iran, would he really care about democracy and reform in that country? The answer is undoubtedly no.The book is an easy read, but the lingering question of whether the author would really care about democracy and reform if he was the hereditary leader of Iran should be foremost on the reader's mind. He comes off as insincere, since it was the despotic rule of his father that put Iran in its present political situation. Maybe his next book should be about and titled ""The Mistakes of My Father."""
1,Hypocrisy Recorded for History,"It is ironic that the shah's son copied textbook democratic principles for this book. It is dull for that reason. It is interesting for another reason, however.The shah was born a commoner with barely enough to eat. His father, Reza's grandfather, gained power in a military overthrow of Iran's centuries old Qajar dynasty. These is no ""Pahlavi dynasty.""Nonetheless, the author of this book about democracy puts an imperial seal on his web site. His mother calls herself an empress on her web site. She has no royal blood; neither did her husband, the shah, who was ousted for being a tyrant. Her son, Reza, the author of this book, gives interviews saying that Iran may not be ready for democracy, and if asked to be king, he would do his duty - he wishes!In light of his public stance, his writing of this book is cynical pandering in an attempt to gain U.S. support. What is most offensive is that he underestimates the intelligence of others."
1,Exterminated dinosaur trying to go back to power,"Thinking about Pahlavis going back to Iran is like thinking about Romanovs to become the Tsars of Russia again. Nobody forgets the dictatorship of Reza Pahlavi's father. Totalitarianism of Islamic Republic regime does not justify going back in the history to revive the dead body of monarchy in Iran. For Iranians the name Pahlavi doesn't mean any thing more than a word like Qajar: These are exterminated dinosaurs who are interesting to watch but nobody wants them back in power again.Iran is a republic and it stays a republic, with or without the word ""Islamic"". Reza Pahlavi should forget about becoming a king in Iran and do his own business in America. Pahlavi family is a part of history for Iranians, ... and I have to say a dark part of it."
5,"Great, But Outdated","This was an excellent book if it was considered fiction. Even though the story is true, O' Barry's views are totally outdated, marine parks in the 60's are VERY different from what they are now. An awesome book, but O' Barry needs to get his head out of the past."
1,An unobjective look at dolphin training in the '60's,"This book is filled with inaccuracies and misinformation regarding dolphins in captivity. The authors jump from topic to topic, frequently leaving the audience wondering whether the authors even wrote a rough draft of this book. Primevil and narrow minded, O'Barry infers that animal training techniques of the 1960's are still in use today. O'Barry frequently uses the book as a soapbox to promote himself as an all knowing dolphin expert who can do no wrong. Although the text does offer O'Barry's sometime clouded, but interesting history of the ""old days""...the reader is left with an over all bad taste in his mouth as the book ends. The best part of the book are the archival photos of dolphins in 1960's ""Flipper"" television series.Dr. Roger H. Cranium, PhD"
4,"Powerful drill, a bit heavy","I found this drill on sale at Loew's for the same price listed on Amazon.com for the D10VH, which was the drill that I was originally looking for. Unlike the D10VH, it comes standard with a keyed chuck, which was a plus for me.This drill is quite a bit more than I really needed. It's got tremendous torque - you can drill through or screw just about anything down without any problem. It is nose heavy and unless you are a lot stronger than I am, expect to use this drill with two hands always. There is a hole for an attachable handle on this drill.The speed adjustment for this drill is quite sensitive. At full speed, this drill is not that noisy, an improvement over my old Black and Decker drill."
4,One of the pioneers of Rap with rhythem and style,"Nice and Smooth are the pioneers of Rap with ""rhythem and style"". They took rap to another level in the late eighties.Their hit song ""Funky for you"" is one of the top favorite song of all New yorkers who really love Hip Hop music."
5,Masterpiece,"A very concise yet informative survey of world history from the antiquity. This book touches almost everything important in history. Could be used both for recreational reading and also as a primer in world history for a university/school course. The only flaw in the book is that it stops abruptly in 1932. No fault of Mr Nehru, though. I guess someone should work on this book and bring it up to date."
4,the reader from japan doen not know the facts,"nehro or ghandi were not muslims. If you want to assign a religion to them you MUST know your facts. I believe they susbcribe to the ""truth"" and ""faith in goodness"" from hinduism, islam and christianity."
4,Opera Planning,"Turandot is not one of my favorite operas, it being not as well known as Madam Butterfly. But I enjoyed this film because it illustrates how cross cultures can work together to create a beautiful production. Chinese opera itself is incredible, but in this film, a movie director is put in charge of the production. There is a big difference between stage lighting and film lighting. This film depicts resolving differences between crews. Not too much here about the singers, or the orchestra. Meta has a role, but it's basically about making this thing work. I especially enjoyed the army troops being used as extras."
1,The Turandot Project,"I gave this DVD a low rating simply because the visual quality was extremely poor. It looked more like a poorly made VCD or perhaps even just a counterfeit copy. How can the director of cinematography justify this kind of work for such an ""epic"" production?"
2,I am not sure who the audience is for this.,"I do not think that the video is useful to martial artists, or potential game designers, etc. One can watch more advanced versions of this type of thing on YouTube (e.g. clips from Human Weapon). It might have been interesting to watch in 2005, but today the technology is outdated. I am not sure if it has anything to offer, except to show what was ""cutting edge"" in software in 2005."
3,Gets the job done,"This is something you would expect to find at a swap meet. The quality is pretty bad, and the LED light doesn't work well for me- the button is very very tough to press, so much that your finger gets sore trying to keep the light on, and the connection inside is bad, so the light turns on and off even with full force. However, this is primarily a pick holder keychain, and it does that perfectly. Though it only fits 2 of my picks (I'm a bass player, one is 2.0 and the other 1.something), it's still good if you ever need to whip out a pick."
5,This made an awesome gift.,This unique gift put a big smile on the male teen musician in our home and that made me smile.
5,perfect gift,"My husband was so impressed how I found such a little tiny gift that meant so much. I bought it for him a while back, but he still has it on his keychain and never has to worry about forgetting to bring his pick when he goes out to play with his buddies. It's still holding up after quite a long time too, even the light still works."
2,Broken Product,"The light doesn't work - from the ""Sqeeze here to try"" on the outer package. This try-before-buy type of packaging risks product damage - as not new, but used or (as in this case) broken. It was a Christmas gift. Very disappointed and unhappy."
2,BOOOOOO,Light stopped working after a month. It only can handle 4 thick picks. Without the light it is pointless to have something so bulky.
2,Broke right away,"While this was the perfect gift for my musician husband, the key chain loop gave out after two days of use. Now it is just a useless pick holder - keeping picks out of his pockets was the main goal. very disappointed that weak craftmanship on a simple metal chain ruined an otherwise perfect gift."
4,FINE DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS,"Despite its small size, this well-structured dictionary did not stop at defining terms. It gave comprehensive descriptions (and explanations) whenever necessary. Its scope embraced all aspects of business: finance, management, commerce, accounting, and so on.It is very portable and easy-to-use. Its 7,500 headwords included most terms which users are likely to encounter more often. All the important biz acronyms and jargons were included.This is one dictionary that I will recommend for both students and business travellers. It is a reliable companion."
4,A very useful dictionary,"I found this dictionary extremely useful.At work I usually come across with thousands of business terms,that now I am able to understand and make use of. I recommend this pocket-sized dictionary for those people who,like me, work as translators and who often need a quick-reference book. This dictionary is very helpful because of its concise definitions and the introduction of new terms, such as computer and internet terms."
2,Way too complicated,"I bought this because it was available on kindle, instead of another, which was not. You need to a get business dictionary in order to understand this business dictionary. It often explains a term buy using even more complicated terms. I'm stuck with it because I'm too late for my kindle refund."
3,Doesn't Add Very Much,"Its very useful, but then, if you have the other Barron's dictionaries, it does not add a whole lot of extra heft to your business vocabulary. Would be nice to see a little more diversity in the definitions."
5,Burpin' Awesome!,"Pencils beware! My kids absolutely love this toy. The monster makes chewing noises when you ""feed"" him a pencil and burps when you remove it. Their big Christmas gift was an art table, and they received many art supplies. This, sharpener, however, has been a runaway favorite from the moment my girls (three and six) received it. This product is made of durable plastic. They have already dropped it multiple times and it continues to work. The only feature that might be an issue is the trap for pencil shavings located underneath the monster. I'm hoping my three year old won't decide to run off with it, because it's easy to remove and kind of small. Overall, an excellent aid for homework or art projects."
3,Second time a charm,"I bought this at a toys-r-us a one-hour drive from my home. I was in disgust when I got home and found it was broke right out of the box! Batteries were in just fine, it just didn't work. I even tried to take it apart to see if anything was loose.Once I returned it and got another (which I made them test in the store!), it works great. My pencils come out nice and sharp. The crunching and burping the monster provides is cute, but it would be nice to be able to turn this off. It gets old after awhile. Otherwise, this is a good sharpener once you get a working model!"
2,Misleading title for a game collection,"If you are looking for a tutorial on king's indian tipical plans, this is the wrong book.What you get is a collection of some 240 annotated games, grouped in chapters according to the informator classification. Every game contains an idea, but there is no advice on state of the art (back in 2004) for that line.The book design is quite poor, games moves are not visually apart from the comments (yes they are written in bold, but difficult to distinguish from the rest).There is a rich bibliography, but not a variation table.Compared with books like ""Play The King's Indian"", by Gallagher, or ""Play the Nimzoindian"", by Deering this book is a waste of paper."
4,Time to mix the mixers!,"This NSMM album took an interesting turn. Instead of having individual remixers work on each track, many of the tracks are remixed by multiple artists! Some of the songs will sound quite familiar - since this album goes under the guise of ""Selection Non Stop Mega Mix"". For example track 12 starts as the Thunderpuss remix of Surreal from NSMM3, but quickly diverges to include several other remixers (I don't have their names offhand). Similarly, they use a mix of Junior Vasquez's ""Appears [Junior appears on the air] mix"" (as seen on NSMM2) as part of the bridge to ""M"".As with all other AyuMix NSMM CDs, there center few songs are slow, and detract from the overall great dance feel to the disc, which, is why I gave this a 4 instead of a 5."
5,Absolutely the Best BBC series on the market !,"I have been a fan of the DVD series that acorn media has made available. This, unquestionably, is the best of the series. I watched both Series One and Two almost continuously and was thoroughly entertained. My only disappointment was that there is not currently a series three available to continue the saga. It is now a close tie between Foyle's War and Enemy at the Door regarding which was the better of the series. I believe that it is a dead heat. I hope that more episodes are forthcoming."
4,We Need a Season Three,Excellent season Two. It did get a little slow in parts. Would of liked to see another season to see the Brits being liberated.
1,Never received order,"I'm unhappy with this order since it still hasn't arrived andit has been a month now. I've been informed it was sent'media mail' whatever that is, but this is ridiculous. Nofurther word from the seller at this point."
5,I love it,"I can not say a lot about auto parts,but it is the right one,I have it just in time when I need it! Thanks!"
2,lousy product for the money,"these struts are your absolute basic strut. comes with no needed accessorys. the extras cost 35.00 x, so better off buying the fully assembled strut. as for the responsiveness, it's as bad as the old strut that came off of it. when unlocked, it just barely pushed the rod out. the old shock worked better."
2,The Complete Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.Vol 2,"I didn't look at the year setting of this book. Was expecting them from the 60's Not the case.Ok,would not order again,looking for the years we used to buy them as I said in the 60's."
4,good buy,The conductor replacement power cord is a God ítem for might jobs. The price was inexpensive i do not us it as much as i thought i would have but it is ok.thankshenry johnson
5,Love it!,"I didn't have the same problems as the previous reviewer. The mat stays put, keeps the dirt off the floor of the car, and draws a lot of admiration from friends who see them. I also bought the CD holder, the seat cushion and the trash bag.The reaction from every one - Where did you buy that?My mother even asked me to get her a set for Christmas.Long story short, I love the product and am glad I bought it!"
3,MATS HAVE THEIR FLAWS,"I had bought these when I bought my seat covers and they looked good for a short time. I quickly learned that they don't stay put and slide all over the place. I, like the other user, have to constantly adjust them which can get frustrating. The butterflies also peel off after awhile and that was the main reason I bought them. All in all it's an O.K. product, but next time I'll just buy plain floor mats."
2,much less than I hoped for...,"I felt the mats were lacking, they are constantly moving around on my floor and do not cover all of the flooring of my car as the previous mats did (and I have a compact car). I found the colors to be ""off"" as well, with more of a purple color for the butterflies instead of the white the picture shows (and that is on the seat covers). Overall I would not buy these again."
3,A sword is a sword.,My sons played with these a lot. They liked their looks and liked being transformers. The toys are not as neat as Light Sabers but close. Boys need a good selection of swords and sabres etc. for imaginative role-playing and these were a good addition to their prop box.
5,Great For Kids!,"This book great for kids who love pokemon! Mew is the cutest Pokemon, so kids will enjoy him,just buy this book for your child!"
3,Undersized,"I ordered a cheap 20x40 ft tarp. I received a cheap tarp and this is OK, the problem I have is it is undersized approximately 18x38 ft."
3,dead reckoning:calculating without instruments,"I bought this book so I could continue with a higher than arithmetic math. What I discovered was that although it does show algebra and other math, there are NO exercises in this book. It has fantastic math examples and processes. I wish it was designed to bring us along with it."
5,Just what my wife wanted,"Great item and fast delivery! My wife loves the scent and it made a great gift for christmas. Thanks for the fast shipment, getting it here in time for the holiday celebration."
1,False Advertising,"Kit contains an old-style mandrel with the screw on top to hold the wheels, and some cut-off wheels. It was advertised to include an EZ402 mandrel and 10 EZ lock cut-off wheels....it does not. Beware."
4,Killer!,"This is classic Six Feet Under, and is better than their last release and there are no stupid covers on this one!"
5,EXCELENTE ACCESORIO PARA IPAQ POCKET PC!!!,"Cuando compre esta Pocket Pc, tuve el problema que era bastante facil utilizar toda la memoria disponible interna, unos cuantos juegos y programas extras dejan poca memoria libre. Con COMPACT FLASH EXPANSION PACK tengo la oportunidad de guardar libros, MP3, archivos en excel, word, en una sola COMPACT FLASH CARD. Funciona mucho mejor este tipo de tarjetas de memoria que el sistema que utiliza PALM m505(Por experiencia propia, yo cambie esta PALM m505 por la IPAQ). Yo recomiendo este accesorio para quienes necesitan memoria adicional..Antonio."
4,Worth having,This a good product for its price. For (...)dollars you can add a modem or expand memory or add a wireless ethernet or ethernet or make your IPAQ GPS capable. But one thing product lacks is that it uses the battery of the IPAQ so it reduces the time you can use the IPAQ. The PC card expansion has its own battery so it helps the IPAQ last a little longer. And the PC card expansion has more items that can be used with it. So you just have to see which is more usable for you the CF card expansion or the PC card expansion or none if you dont need the expansions.
3,Problem is not with the product,"My problem with this product is not the functioning of it, but the fact that cases made for the IPAQ, won't support use of this product!!!It works exactly as designed with no problems whatsoever. I can even plug in the sleeve ""hot"" and it works like plug and play. But if you need a case, you'll have to use an aftermarket ""large"" PDA case, or a small digital camera case."
2,"Winner Takes All, Loser Reads All","Am I the only one whoes just does not like Rayner's writing? I feel like I was reading a bad Target novelisation, not a novel I paid 15 dollars for. Maybe she should attend an ADULT writer's workshop.One of the many things I had issues with was the use of current pop references. Good Who novels are timeless. I can pick up Love and War and read it 12 years after it was written. This novel will seem painfully dated in a few months.Also, going back and visitiing the family and stumbling into an adventure has gotten pretty stale.For a second book, it read as fast as a Telos novella, but without the quirkiness. I hope the third is better. Save your money and order some classic Who novels."
2,sigh,"ok i never got into their first cd.this one however has a lot more technical riffs, its a lot cleaner and good production.HOWEVER, the one thing why i dont like this cd, is the drummer. he's good but he does the same thing during EVERY breakdown, always uses his china constantly. i didnt find one breakdown that didnt sound similar cause their drummer.and becasue of that, this cd is crappy"
3,Variety is the Spice of Life!!,"The basic sound is there, hard, fast, screaming, breakdowns etc. Upon future listens, I would upgradte this to 4 stars! These guys pummel you start to finish like a 2X4, pow right in the kisser. I'll agree with everyone else, most of the breakdowns sound identical, but I really don't care, they sound dang good don't they? I love chunky breakdowns, but I like to have variety in them like Unearth and Killswitch do. But hell, this album is strong and has lots of good stuff to offer. I think next time around they'll be a little more diverse with things. I wonder if they felt rushed to get this out the door. A lot of times the sophomore album is the first one a band has a timetable to put something together. Hopefully some more ideas flow into the next album because these guys could make a masterpiece of an album."
1,"Smells good, but doesn't work!","I ususally use Matrix Amplify (loyal user), but decided to try this.After using it twice, it made my hair flat and greasy. I used it with the shampoo, and was very dissatisfied.I would throw it out, but my guests seem very impressed!"
1,Not impressed,"I thought at these prices Aveda products would be great, but I'm not impressed. I don't see any difference in my hair between using this conditioner and the $3.99 conditioner I get at Trader Joe's. This one smells kind of nice, but upon close inspection, you'll see that most of the fragrance comes from isolates, i.e. chemical constituents that make up essential oils, such as linalool found in lavender, geraniol in geranium, etc. These may be natural or synthetic, most likely the latter. Won't be spending this king of money again."
1,No dancing involved...,"This DVD has two workouts: one is mat based (50 min), the other is done standing (33 minutes). Her moves do not involve much dancing at all and I was very disappointed. She tells you to breathe at least a thousand times, which I found irritating. The production quality is very low: the set is as basic as possible and you do see the camera equipment in several shots. I won't be doing it again!"
2,"Not dance, but good for stretching","I was a jazz dancer a number of years ago and thought this would help me start up again. It is an excellent video for stretching and flexibility, but if you're looking for actual jazz dances, keep looking."
3,Almost Good,"A few good songs. Some cringeworthy. Mostly schmaltzy (i.e. slightly dated sound) semi-intense psychedelic rock-pop. Not ahead of their time pop rock. One of those tight but slightly disappointing (unless listened to while intoxicated) bands with a few sharp songs that don't represent their potential that struggles beneath the surface. They probably sounded better live and had overproduced songs recorded (a theory). Their predicament (not their music) reminds me of a really great but now unknown San Francisco ska/punk band called The Offs (c.1977-1978), who made an LP, maybe with a different line-up, and it was no where near as good as them live (I traded it back to the store).I RATE IT: 2.7 stars."
5,Scholarly substance and extensive reference value.,"This work is indispensable as perhaps the only comprehensive and encyclopedic overview of the analytical study of myth and ritual. Every significant theoretical perspective is covered in depth and placed within a systematic context. I found the author's philosophic and discursive approach valuable as he provides both a broad conceptual framework and the specific tools and resources necessary for deeper investigation and study. The personalized style-- at times lighthearted, wry, or ironic-- leavens the deep insights and consistent scholarly substance of this updated edition."
1,mythography,"I have to agree with the reviewer who find this book appalling. Mr. Doty seems to belong to the let it all hang out school of scholarship-don't deliver reasoned opinions, but any opinion as long as it is your own. This is not a scholarly book-for all of Doty's exhaustive knowledge-but a book of strange opinions spiced with Doty's all intrusive liberal opinions on current politics. This book is shameful, but probably accurately reflects the state of contemporary scholarship in out baby-boomer, narcissistic universities."
3,ATV Fender packs,"Well made product, reasonably priced. The packs are relatively small in scale to a typical sized ATV. They would work well on a ""kiddy-sized"" bike. The item was returned and repalced with larger packs."
4,Is everything I expected to be...GREAT!!,"I did not finish the book yet, but so far is incredible accurate, easy to read. Have lots of information for us ladies, to deal in a man world."
4,I wish more women would read this...,"This book is marvelously written and an easy read. The suggestions are invaluable (I learned a host of things!) and I wish that a number of my female colleagues would read this, as I see them sabotage themselves daily in the workplace. My teenage daughter started reading it and now wants her own copy--the suggestions are timeless. I would also suggest Lois Frankel's Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office."
2,I Thought Women at the Top Tried Harder,"Ms. Evans' book ""Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman"" was a superficial treatment of the challenges women face in the world of work. Much of the advice she offers is repackaged advice such as one might have found in ten-year-old back issues of advice columns in ""Working Woman"" magazine. Her advice is often contradictory and may leave the reader more confused than enlightened. On the one hand Ms. Evans offers simplistic, pat solutions to gender-based misunderstandings, and in the next breath she allows that every situation is unique and that women must rely on their intuition. I purchased the book based on my interest in the interview she did with Larry King, but was disappointed to find that most of the best insights the book had to offer had been presented in the interview."
4,"Outdated, but worth your time","This book is quite the easy read, and has many helpful suggestions. As a female engineer just reently entering the workplace, some of these are lessons I have yet to learn, others are incredibly obvious. Many of the issues discussed are rather outdated. They seem more to refer to Gail Evans entire career experiences rather than present day realities. Some of these just don't apply to modern generations."
5,"Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman","Could be subtitled; How Not To Shoot Yourself in the Foot. I'd like to join in with the positive reviews of this book. I'm a business school student and I read this book on the recommendation of a visiting female executive. I've since lent it out to my classmates and have watched it be passes around from woman to woman. We love it! Evans offers simple, easy to relate to examples of behavior women adopt in the workplace that can be ""career limiting."" She openly challenges the reader to see which of her observations fit and which don't to each woman's unique situation. A well balanced, honest set of suggestions and observations that will benefit any woman seeking to advance in her career."
1,Are the 5-stars reviews written by REAL readers ?,"Just curious ... why all the 5-stars reviews rated by annoymous readers are written around April 9, 10 & 12, 2000 ? Are these reviews written by REAL readers ?"
5,Helped Me to Successfully Negotiate My Promotion,"Extremely vital tips and to dos for any woman, regardless of what stage of life you are in. This book was the prefect mantra to read the night before my annual review and proved instrumental in coaching me thorugh difficult negitiations. A must read for any woman looking to get ahead."
4,First rate! For women of all ages!,"Gail Evans uses her working knowledge to enlighten us all. This book is perfect for all women but I think men would get something here as well. Hopefully, generation after generation will continue to evolve. Excellent writing style and quite informative."
4,Includes the Hannibal biopic with Alexander Siddig,"The first two disks include 6 one-hour docudramas, spectacularly produced, about Spartacus, Attila the Hun, The Shogun, Richard the Lionheart, Cortes, and Napolean. Disk 3, as bonus features, include a 90-minute docudrama about Hannibal starring Alexander Siddig (available at last in the US), a one-hour doc about Hannibal, and a one-hour docudrama about Genghis Khan. Production values are very high. This set is a great value for the history-lover."
5,Best Translation of Theocritus available!,"Thelma Sargent translation of Theocritus's Idylls is the best I've encountered. She renders the poetry beautifully and clear. It is highly readble and engaging.Theocritus can be a hard poet to translate, but she does so with ease and joy!...all the while being faithful to the original lines.I find that the oxford edition by Anthony Verity, is a bit stuffy and forced, and the only real comparison is the Penguin edition (now out of print).As with her stunningly amazing version of Homeric Hymns, her Theocritus is as wonderfully successful!"
5,The only one.,"How happy I was to find this most important documentary on CFIDS. I felt so grateful to Kim Snyder for making this film which, not only let me know I am not alone but, gave me a very good visual tool to educate my family,friends and colleagues who really don't get it. My husband and I were particularly struck by the testimony of one family member who related that, unless you live with a CFIDS sufferer you really have no idea. The fact is that people only see us when we are having a good day and can get out of bed through the miracle of chemistry. This is a must have film for all CFIDS sufferers. Buy two! One for you and one to lend out. I only wish there were more than one film on this subject and that it were easier to find."
5,Inspiring and healing,"I was certainly one of those people who knew little and cared less about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. This film changed all that. It challenged my preconceptions and inspired me to both appreciate my own health and to be more caring and open-minded with people who suffer from any illness.A beautifully crafted film that both informs and entertains, ""I Remember Me"" engaged me with its personal stories and dramatic revelations. Definitely worth owning to share with friends and family."
5,Must See,"This is a great documentary and I highly recommend it. It opens up discussion about this tragic and debilitating disease, and opens some interesting discussion about undeniable existence of the condition known as CFS/ME, and how it affects millions of peoples lives across the world. This documentary shows how CFS/ME has largely been ignored by governments and some medical establishments, even when there have been case tested doctors willing to open their files to help try to find answers. It helps people understand the hardships and patient care injustices that surround this very misunderstood disease. If you are a sufferer, or the friend of one, or even more importantly a person who works in the medical profession, you should see this!"
4,Foreign Language Teaching Tool,"""Va de cuento"" is a collection of pictures, showing a series of short scenes. Reflecting a variety of situations and activities, it is a very useful teaching tool for getting students talking about the scene.Handy for exercises in building vocabulary and practicing grammar, both for writing and for speaking, Va de cuentos is a versatil teaching tool which is recommended highly."
4,Collection,"I am completing my collection of this author, I got the book from this seller and he sent it fast"
3,"Small town life, lawyer in love, slow pace","This book was listed as a ""thriller"" when I got it. I could honestly say the last 40 pages fit that description. However, the first 360 pages were a leisurely paced, somewhat corny romance between former high school sweethearts who reunite due to their jobs. I did not sympathize with the main character; he was dull and selfish. For pete's sake, he resented sharing his food with the woman he supposedly was falling for. I did thoroughly enjoy the Hmong janitor who could discern the spirit realm; he was the heart of the book for me. The plot included a very large red herring which seemed obvious to me. All in all, occasional excitement amidst a lot of the lawyer-protagonist's angst and cluelessness. Possibly a turn-on for residents of rural North Carolina where the story is set. 3 stars down the middle."
2,High expectations DASHED,This was my first Whitlow read and I expected a lot more after hearing about his THE LIST & THE TRIAL. Possibly this too could have been a good 200 page book but I felt like the contract called for 400 pages and I had to suffer through all the detail of EVERY scene and character. Ultimately the ending was more than predictable and my two stars are for the story line because I basically enjoyed a few twists.
5,The Sacrifice by: Robert Whitlow,"This was the first whitlow book i've read and i went from being on the computer, watching tv, listening to music etc to reading books all the time. This was one book that kept me up many nights because i couldnt put it down. I always wanted to know the full story and i finally fingured it all out at the end. A lot of unexpecting events happend a lot. It kept me on the endge of my seat the whole time. Now thanks to this book all i do in my spare time is read. What a great book to start with to becoming a book worm. this is a must read for any one expectially teenagers. whitlow does a good job gettin inside our heads."
4,Kaplan GMAT CAT 1999 - 2000,"I recently completed the GMAT CAT and scored marginally higher versus the Kaplan CD ROM. Agree with another reviewer that the quantitative questions on Kaplan were harder but the verbal seemed easier.My advice, if you're weak in math, algebra and problem solving, you should definately challenge yourself with Kaplan. However, if your weakness is in verbal skills, you may want to look for additional reference. In fact, recommend that you acquire a second study guide (without CD-ROM to save costs) to get a good understanding and feel for the test.The simulated Kaplan CAT is very similar in design and execution to the real thing (sorry didn't try out other simulated CAT's to compare). I found this to be very helpful as you will know exactly what to expect on test day.Lastly, recommend that you study about one month in advance (but not too much longer than that, since you will tired yourself out). Most important, take the few days before the test off and relax!Good luck!"
3,Much harder than the real test! --Only Quantitative section,"Everybody here says that Kaplan is much harder than the real test, it is only partially tru. I did 630, 640 and 650 on Kaplan, but I got only 580 on the real test! This is because Kaplan is harder only on Quantitative section but easier on Verbal. So, it is premature to say that Kaplan is much harder, it depends."
2,Do Not Purchase Study Guide with CD Version,The study guide was excellent. It gives hints on finding short cuts to answers. It focuses on what you need to know. The only problem is with the CD rom. It didn't install successfully and Kaplan offered no support. If you go to the Kaplan web site read the FAQ ... you'll see many on the FAQs addresses GENERAL PROTECTION FAULTS and SYSTEM CRASHES. Kaplan knows the software is unrealiable... purchase the study guide without the CD. Use another software for simulated GMAT CAT exams.
2,You pay money for nothing!!,"I studied the book completely,and in my own opinion I found it adds nothing to one's basic Knowledge.I found the book to be misleading in some information about the GMAT CAT.Finally,the cd contains good questions, and that what makes it a two-star book."
4,CD full length Tests were tougher than the GMAT by A LOT,"I used the CD more than the book, I only read a couple chapters of the book but liked it. On the CD I liked the teaching/review areas and thought the section practice tests were at about the right level, and perhaps slightly more challenging. However, the practice full length tests were a great deal harder than the actual GMAT CAT. On the practice tests I got (in order) 590, 570, and 560. This was a bit discouraging for me. I decided I had done as much as I could and took the GMAT anyway. I got a 750. I'm not certain if I'm thrilled with the book or upset at it."
2,Great Book,"The book was great. It contained many different techniques on approaching problems, which I would never have though of. The CD on the other hand never worked. I called customer service and they refused to help me. They kept blamming my computer, saying my version of win '98 was defective. Their answer was go bother your computer manufacturer."
4,"Overall, a very good product.","Overall, Kaplan has put together a very good product for the GMAT test.Although i did not find many of the test taking techniques in the book useful (as many of them were common sense anyway), I found the CD rom to be very good. The CD rom contains not only a number of computer adaptive tests, but also a multi-media learning course.In relation to whether the Kaplan CAT questions are representative of those in the real test, my comments are as follows:Maths: Kaplan questions are arguably harder and slightly different to those in the real GMAT.Sentence correction: Kaplan's are slightly easier.Reading comprehension: Kaplan's seem to be representative. Note, however, some passages in real GMAT may be longer than Kaplan's.Critical reasoning: Kaplan's are generally representative.Again, a very good product overall. I would argue that the Kaplan book is the best non-official GMAT preparatory material available in a book store."
2,Unusable Software,"While the book compactly summarizes Kaplan's approach to taking the the GMAT, the software is a nightmare to install. It doesn't work on Windows NT and may not function on some Windows 95 and 98 computers. Even as a certified network administrator, I was not able to get the software to work properly on any of the operating systems. Beware of any software that has Windows and Mac programs on the same CD. Stick with ETS' Powerprep -- it's more robust and actually works."
4,"Very much worth the investment, but...","VERY GOOD RESOURCE:* The book and software are pretty comprehensive, and the testing tips and drills are very helpful,BUT:* You need to practice with real questions from the book/software put out by GMAC.ALSO:* The practice tests are very difficult -- my score was over 100 points below my actual GMAT score. That only makes getting the real past tests and questions more important. So, don't let the practice test scores discourage you.GOOD LUCK!"
4,Hard Questions but Quite Helpful,"Most of the other reviews are right on in that the questions on the three practice tests are very difficult relative to the real thing. Try not to get discouraged with low scores on the Kaplan tests, your actual score will be much higher. I think the best strategy is, as one reviewer mentioned, to begin with the Kaplan prep and take a couple of the ETS tests right before the real test."
5,Excellent resource,This book was an excellent resource. It thoroughly prepared me for the GMAT and it helped me raise my score 70 points. It's the best $30 I ever spent.
2,Good Material but the CD may not work.,"I bought the book because the ratings were good. I flipped through the different books at the store and Kaplan looked the best. I planned on studying using the CD. I have had a lot of trouble getting the CD to work. It keeps locking up my PC (Pentium 90, Windows 95). As mentioned in other comments, some of the software on the CD is outdated and you may have difficulty using the CD if you have a high speed CD-ROM drive. My CD drive is 24X. I am disappointed that the CD is not up to speed with current technology. When it says it works with Windows 3.1 thats a hint to beware."
1,How can you turn Scooby Doo into this junk!,"This is the worst dvd ever, nobody should buy this! If i were you i would buy the older scooby doo's, like Scooby Doo Where Are you, or if you like the newer Scooby Doo's i would go for Whats New Scooby Doo.So, never ever buy this or any other seasons of a Pup Named Scooby Doo!Never!!!"
3,3 year old loves it.,"My 3 year old grandson loves this DVD. He watches it over and over. As the adult reviewing this product it is very poor quality. Very grainy images in a lot of the shows. It can be overlooked if your child loves A Pup Named Scooby Doo as much as my grandson does. He doesn't seem to notice the poor quality but then he does love that ""baby scooby doo""."
3,Confusing!,"Maybe I'm too old for this kind of game, but I was confused by a number of the tasks. The clock section never did make sense to me. Neither did the garden or the corral. I just didn't get the ideas and the instructions were vague. I was dissappointed."
3,"5636547,643786289,5890,2 stars isn't even enough!",this game is so good! there should even be a real place called zoombiniland.
1,Does it work on Macs?,"Although Zoombinis Mountain Rescue works fine on MacOS X (Panther), neither of the other two Zoombini adventures (Island Odyssey and Maths Journey) work on either my iMac or my eMac - they either crash after the opening video or don't run at all. Island Odyssey claims to be X compatible. Maths Journey ought to run under Classic. The Reader Rabbit CDs work fine under Classic.Tech support don't bother to reply or say they don't support it any more."
5,Great analytical stimulation for a child,"We play many adult and child board and online games and I am not aware of a game that is more mentally stimulating while being fun for a child. My daughter has been playing this since she turned 4 and continues to ask for this series two years later. I am not sure that one needs to have all of the games from the series, since many of the puzzles are based on the same type of logic, but I feel that every child should own a copy of one. Since the puzzles offer four levels of difficulty, most of them would be challenging for the average adult. The great replay value will help boost a child's analytical skills to a point that many of their school tasks become trivial.Yes, there seem to be a puzzle or two here and there that are confusing and I haven't figured out if the logic is ""what it should be"", but may be I just don't have that type of logic yet..."
1,Zoombinis Island Odyssey,"My son was VERY disappointed with the Island Odyssey game. He has played both the Logical Journey and the Mountain Rescue and loved them, so I thought buying the third one was a good idea. Instead, it was a WASTE of my money. It brought him to tears because it was so difficult too quickly - unlike the other versions that gradually get harder. If you're looking to buy a Zoombinis game - don't buy this one, buy either Logical Journey or Mountain Rescue instead."
4,"Great book, very detailed.","A very thorough and comprehensive guide to using grids in Graphic Design.Upon first read, I thought I knew most of what was mentioned, but upon revisiting you appreciate more and more the knowledge that the author has.A great reference to have, even in this technological age."
4,good book but,"why is this thing so expensive and so difficult to findamazon is by far the cheapest place to get it, but it took atleast a month to get to me"
4,Truly a classic,"I was most anxious to get this book and for good reason. This book is truly a classic. Very basic and yet informative, this book really undergirds any graphic design project. This book may, however, be too basic for some, who might expect a new trend in graphic design. It is a fundamental book that really does lay the foundation for building graphic design grids."
2,Pretty cheapo,"There aren't too many people selling 3 row belts like this on the current market so my choices were quite limited. That's a shame because it allows cheap junk like this to be the only option. After only a few days of use, the top layer is pealing off and the grommets are ripping out. This is one cheap belt. Expect the need to buy a new one every week or so."
5,Bill Deal's Music,I danced to this music in the 60's at The Peppermint in Va Beach and this music helps keep those memories alive.
1,Very disappointing cookbook,"Review by Linda Coss, author of ""What's to Eat? The Milk-Free, Egg-Free, Nut-Free Food Allergy Cookbook"".Nine years ago, when my son was first diagnosed with multiple food allergies, this was the first cookbook I purchased. It proved to be very disappointing. The title of the book is quite misleading -- the book does not contain 325 recipes that are ""free of wheat, milk, eggs, corn, yeast, sugar and other common food allergens."" Many of the recipes contain one or more of these ingredients, and a large number of the recipes contain nuts, which is probably one of the most common food allergen there is.I tried many of these recipes anyway, with absolutely no success. I realize that my family is not accustomed to ""natural foods""-style cooking, but we still found these dishes unpalatable."
4,An excellent resource for hypoallergenic cooking.,I am a naturopathic physician and I deal with many patients who have food allergies and intolerances. I have found this book to be an excellent resource and recommend it frequently to my patients. I have tried some of the recipes myself and they were good. Definitely a great place to start on the very difficult path of changing to a hypoallergenic diet.
2,Not exactly 325 recipes,"I felt the title and synopsis were just a little misleading. I can't eat ANY of the allergens listed. However, only a handful of the recipes don't have all of the allergens. A little disappointing because I had high hopes that this book would be helpful."
4,Very informative,"Although I did find that there are a few recipes which do contain ingredients that are supposedly not in this cookbook, I found the recipes interesting and tasty. If you ensure you use light buckwheat flour as recommended in applicable recipes and follow other hints provided by the author, I've found the recipes to be very good overall. This is a very good basic cookbook for people, like myself, who are just starting to discover the world of allergy free cooking/eating."
3,not that good,"You actually need a bunch of these things to make the wire stay down properly. I would instead suggest sticking with what you get with the iMow and using those in conjunction with burying the wire about 3 inces into the earth.Not only is burying the wire cleaner and cheaper (I used a ... garden hoe and it worked perfectly) but you don't need to be purchasing these things like it's going out of style.I found you need to place these a lot closer than the directions suggested at first. Especially if iMow is set to the lowest setting.However, if you do want to go the peg route you will not find plastic stakes for cheaper. The only other place I found them was in camping stores ..."
3,You'll need a lot of these!,"As another reviewer stated, you need a LOT of these. I have a rather modest yard with a few trees, have so far used 200 of these, and hope the 50 more on their way will be enough. I've also found that they break pretty easily, so be careful with them."
5,SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL,"Kent Anderson has written a completely raw and engrossing story of how war alters one's percetion. Sargent Hanson's jorney into the elite madness of special forces keeps you reading nonstop.True in it's nature to the time period as well as the military life style, it's a truly powerful message of what has happened to America's lost generation."
5,READ THIS REVIEW AFTER YOU READ THE OTHER REVIEWS,"The problem with the reviews above are that those people don't understand that the ending was not abrupt or too ""hero"" like. The book ends the way it does because the author wanted the reader to contemplate what it means. The author wanted the reader to transform himself into Hanson and try to feel what he feels. Too many people nowadays want everything delivered to them like a great ending to a book was a freakin' double cheesburger. Only read this story if you are capable of using your gray matter in an imaginative way. Then you'll get the ending your looking for. Idiots!"
2,Did not get it,"Had to stop reading about 120 pages into the book. It did nothing for me.All the reviews were so stellar, this is why I kept reading, but could not go any further."
1,Memoirs of a combat soldier? I think not.,"On the jacket of the book Mr. Anderson is identified as a former S.F. sergeant. This may be possible. He has certainly heard a lot of war stories, enough to get some of the facts right. That is as far as it goes, however. As a veteran of SOG, his descriptions of operations in CCN are simply laughable. Locations are wildly out of sync. But these are to be expected from someone who obviously wasn't there. If Mr. Anderson was truly in S.F., I rather suspect it was as a clerk, cook, supply sergeant, or some other job where he could sit at the club and soak up the experiences of those who were there. My main objection, however, is in his descriptions of the hero and his friends. People might think these are accurate. SOG soldiers were just that, soldiers. Acting like these people do would get you killed, and if you survived, court-martialed and sent home. From an actual S.F. soldier, three tours in Vietnam, the last one in SOG. References provided upon request."
3,Tough to put together,It seemed like a good idea and a neat product. It was hard to fit the pieces together and my hamster doesn't seem to care too much for it. She would rather just climb on some boxes.
2,Huge!,I gave this 2 stars because it's huge and unsightly. It probably works but I didn't like how it looked as it was such an eyesore.
1,Garbage,"I bought one of these at a local Menards for $10 back in February, 2011. I should have just set fire to a $10 bill instead. This is nothing more than an expensive over-priced plastic piece of trash. We have these dirty and filthy squirrels here and instead of keeping them off, this only gives a landing pad when jumping, then swinging down to my feeders. I should have saved the $10 I paid for this piece of crap and used it to buy yet another bid feeder to replace yet another one that has been damaged. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,Informative & Thought-Provoking,"It presents information in such a way that you are at the very least, forced to consider what they've presented. As a self-identified ""African-American"" who considers himself a conservative, I think this book does a great job of presenting the foundation of how the problem of race still exists and presents pragmatic ideas - however controversial - that are far better, in my view, than maintaining the status quo.If those who on principle oppose these ideas (specifically, the conservatives this book spends a lot of time lambasting) would come out with substantive data to disprove what this book says, the race debate would become a lot clearer and would bring us closer to realizing a better America for all."
2,Not worth the effort,"If you are familiar with these books, then you probably already have the best ones. This was another attempt at putting a fictional story together with artwork from 1970's SciFi book covers. The story is not good and the art work, though decent, is not the best. The story is strangely disconnected from the story as well. The initial picture is said, in the story, to be of an alien ship. But you can see clear markings on the alien ship of human writing and references to the ""space navy""."
2,Really really small,"this corset is really small. I wear a 40ddd bra and I ordered the size 44 and it cam no where near to fitting me. Even with the laces completely slack I could not get the hoks within 3 inches of each other. Whan I tried to return it I was told that I would be responsible fo shipping. How crappy is that? The color is not really pink. It has a yellow sheen to it and the garment was poorly made. I can make one better myself, for less money."
3,fully reversible?,"Well the item says it is fully reversible, but if you wear it with the black side showing you are required to cut off the strings that are used to hang it on a hanger. They are connected below the top hem so folding them in is not really an attractive option. Otherwise, I have no problem with this corset. It was very cute. I got good reviews all around. I have not tried on the thong, stockings & garters, however, & I have read in most of the other reviews that the stockings will not fit a plus sized person which doesn't make since because it is a plus sized corset. I was just in too much of a hurry to bother with trying on something that I had been told probably would not fit anyway. When I'm in a rush is not the time to be upset that something doesn't fit correctly."
4,Almost Perfect,"The sizing chart was great and worked very well to find the right size. Being plus sized, but small chested can be hard but the dual ribbons made it easier to adjust. I advise rethreading them so that the bows are top and bottom rather than in the middle for plus sized ladies like myself. You also might want to purchase inserts if you have a less endowed chest. I agree with the other customer that it is not fully reversible. Which is probably why they only have pictures of it one way on the website. I would buy it again."
3,Did not come with thong and stockings,"While the corset itself is nice and looks great, I thought the description indicated it came with a matching thong and black stockings. All I received was the corset."
5,Great Corset!,"Great corset! I bought this for Halloween thinking it would be a one time deal but I have wound up wearing it a bunch of other times, under dresses and clingy tops. It is awesome! It holds me in, is made of a durable fabric, makes my posture to die for, and is very sexy and slimming. You can adjust it yourself, you just need to be patient, and it is reversible as long as you have the will-power to notched the eyelets backwards. It is a great buy and really works!"
3,"Pretty good, but not up to par with Different Stars","TW's ""Having"" is pleasant enough to listen to. As always, Anna-Lynne's vocals are a highlight, and the band's playing is good. But ... I just didn't like this one as well as Different Stars (both the '02 and '04 versions). To my ear, there is a certain amount of sameness with some of the songs. Some, such as ""what of me"", I enjoyed. Others are okay but don't really stand out as anything I'll remember over time. You can't fault a band for trying to grow; I only hope ""Having"" is not indicative of the direction TW's music is going.My other gripe is the low quality of the recording or mastering process on some of the songs, which sound scratchy (for example, parts of ""i don't mind""). I know it's not the fault of my speakers since I hear this scratchiness on every set of speakers and players I own, and also from the song samples at iTunes. Perhaps it's unfair to fault the band for this, but ultimately they're responsible for their product."
5,PERFECT!,"I had a carnival birthday party for my children (3 & 6) and wanted to have some carnival music. This was just what I was looking for! The songs are similar, but don't sound exactly the same like on other albums. It gave the party the feeling of being at a carnival! I LOVED it!"
4,Sturdy swing for adults,"We got this to allow us to seing next to our kids since their seings are only rated for 105 pounds. There is absolutely no worry that this swing will support just about any adult (I weigh 185 and it is totally fine). Not the most comfortable swing (thus the 4/5 rating), but very solid and functional. I would buy it again."
3,Not for a weak back!,"I am a great fan of Denise Austin, but this video puts significant strain on your lower back. The workouts are effective for toning your abs. As with many other Austin videos, I appreciate the 10-minute and 15-minute workouts for my busy schedule. Just be sure you can afford the chiropractor bills!"
2,Denise is no longer allowed in my house,"my husband has heard enough about me complaining that Denise Austin makes videos that seem to put the body at risk, and these ab workouts might help some, but they are very hard on the lower back and caused my intense pain, i will not keep using this video, and think many people will agree that this video is not the best ab video for all levels, it is a typical Denise Austin video that will allow you and grate on your nerves, as she does so easily...try something else!"
3,"Brief overview, lots of pictures","A few years after publishing ""The Civil War in North Carolina,"" John Gilchrist Barrett prepared a much condensed version (about 100 pages versus roughly 500 for the larger book) for publication by the North Carolina Division of Archives and History. ""North Carolina as a Civil War Battleground, 1861-1865"" hits the high points covered in the larger work, and contains a larger number of Civil War-era illustrations. It's a good beginning for the casual reader, but those strongly interested in the war in North Carolina should go to Barrett's full-length book, or start with William R. Trotters's three-volume series on the Civil War in North Carolina's coastal, Piedmont, and mountain regions."
4,"Fun, erotic, perfect for couples","Apparently we missed Bliss when it was on TV. While it isn't quite as good as Red Shoes Diaries, it is still fun and entertaining to watch. It explores about every area of sexuality, but does it without full-frontal nudity. It's tasteful and erotic. Romantic and exciting. The series was produced by two women who did a fine job of creating stories that are sexy without being offensive. We're getting the other two seasons that are available. Wish there were more of this kind of DVD's available."
2,"Seriously, Ladies?!","I am all for erotica by and for women, but surely we can do better than this? The production values are painfully low, the plots and dialog are bare-bones, and the actors are stilted and unattractive. It's just like porn for men, only the camera never strays below the waistline.I was particularly interested in the story about the woman who seduces her blind piano tuner. He was actually pretty good looking, but terrible at playing blind, not convincing at all. The woman was older and not attractive. I believe older women can be sexy on film, but at least give her something better to wear than foundational undergarments. It was a good premise, mildly entertaining, but overall not very well executed."
1,"""For Promotional Use Only""","Every episode had a bright warning sign popping up over and over and over: ""For Promotional Use Only."" ""For Promotional Use Only."" ""Etc."" So why did they sell it to me for $9.98 on 5 May 2010? Didn't care much for any of the episodes either. Not bad, just ok."
3,ok,"Well, the skull is definitely smaller than the picture. The wings are different too because they spread out farther into the band of the ring. I was disappointed that the skull was that small though. The band is thin too. Would be worth it if it was $3-4 rather than $7.80. However it is sterling silver."
2,Not as shown,The ring I received is nothing the way its shown in the photo. The band is really small and the skull is a tiny little dot that is barely recognizable. I also do not believe that its sterling silver because my finger turned green the first time I wore it. I am definately disappointed in my purchase.
3,NO AS GOOD AS USUAL!!!,"This book is not as good as other Matt Braun books I have read. Print Oliver comes back from the Civil War. His father has gone downn health. His brothers have all grown up. He, as the oldest is appointed head of the family. He sets out to make the ranch prosper once again. The rest of the book is their story with the villian being Cal Nutt, a carpetbagger. Nutt trys everything he can to get the Olivers to leave the country. Can he make them go? With the four brothers, at least part of the four, fighting back, will they stay. Who gets killed?? I think the first part of the book and the last part were good. So much of the middle was page after page of somebodys thought. I thought I was reading a history book. Thats fine if that is what you like but I don't buy westerns for that."
4,Another great Madeleine Brent book,"When Bridie finds out her father was not who she thought he was, her life changes forever. Her father is determined to have been a jewel thief, causing Bridie to lose everything. Fortunately, an old friend of her mother's offers to help Bridie out- leading Bridie into a life as a music hall performer. Will her father's past compromise her future?"
3,Coming soon to a dentists office near you!,"The band that brought you the music in Titanic, now brings you a Celtic/New Age album. Nothing too demanding of the listener, and most of the songs are good for background music. ""Inside the Shadows"" is notable, although it appears to take its theme from Largo by Antonín Dvorák. Also of note is Evensong, probably the best song on the disc. If you like a lot of Uillean pipes, this is right up your alley. If you're looking for strong melodies, try Fresh Aire."
4,Great book to get kids acitvely involved. Wish they had these for every city we visit!,"Venice is a walking city. This book gave my kids the incentive to take those long, lovely walks. They were eager to check off each treasure in the book, and so it got us though many pleasurable afternoons. We borrowed the ""treasure"" idea when we went to museums, buying postcards in the museum shop and having the kids hunt down the artworks. Worked like a charm! Wish they had these for every city we have visited!"
5,Great book for kids!,"We purchased this booklet - one for each child - in advance of our trip to Venice. This booklet is fantastic! A great way to get your children involved in seeing and learning about Venice. Our children (ages 9, 7, 5 and even 3) were kept happily occupied searching for winged lions and by the other activities in the book. We have also purchased and used the Florence version which is excellent as well. It's worth the price and the cost to make sure each child has their own copy!"
3,venice or bust,"It is a bit early to jugde this book as we are not going until early summer. I can only compare it with the excellent book Things for Kids to Do in Rome. This is a lot shorter and much less information, however I do like the Treasure Hunt format."
4,good stuff,"i heard of pollen through a comp and i fell in love with the song caramel. when i got the cd i was really hesitant at first, but then as i listened to it i got to liking it more and more. it's definitely a good cd worth listening to."
5,too good for radio and MTV,Perfect blend of pop punk and power pop.....man this album rocks....Caramel is a great opener and Chanceless...words cant describe......these fellas are too good for radio and mtv airplay...hell yea!
2,great sound doesn't last,"I bought 1 set of these for use on my patio and 1 set by my pool. The sound quality was excellent in the beginning. However within a month of installation the woofers started going out on the speakers. I kept all sets of speakers covered when not in use, so weather isn't an issue. I am powering them with a 40 watt amp, and as they are rated at 100 amps, it's not my amplifier that is blowing them. I have exchanged them at Radio Shack, 3 different times with the same result in the end. I have resorted to writing KLH directly, but have yet to receive a reply.I am looking for speakers from a new manufacturer for next season!!!"
3,The Saltmen of Tibet,It wasnt as good a movie as I thought it would be. It did arrive in excellent condition.
5,WOW!!,"These speakers blew my mind, without blowing the speakers! I connected these speakers in a matter of minutes. I turned the volume to about 1/4 the way and the clarity was unbeliveable! I raised the volume and the sound got louder but it had that same clarity. The sub is probably the bes computer sub you can get! I would rate this 10 stars but it only goes up to 5."
5,O MY GOD!!!!!,"WOW! It is everything it claims to be...and then some. This system is amazing! Speedy hook-up, excellent sound, only one problem, which is my fault, my Sony Vaio needs a soundcard upgrade in order to experience all four channels plus the subwoofer, but oh well, I'll take care of that. Even without all 4 speakers working it is still amazing!"
2,Great while it works,"I had heard great things about the Monsoon MM 2000 speakers, and ordered a set to take with me to college. The subwoofer was DOA, so I had to ship the whole thing back and wait. Not cool, but oh well. The new set arrived and worked beautifully for just long enough for the warranty to expire. Then the subwoofer quietly, but permanently, died. It gets power, it hums and heats up; not a trace of bass. I should have taken it as a bad sign when the first subwoofer died, but to have a second expire for no good reason? You don't want a disposable speaker system at this price, and just try getting ahold of Monsoon for tech support (such as it is)."
2,"quality is poor, never buy a product again here","The fabric is poor quality, like a old towel! and another bit of advice ""don't buy a holiday gift from a vendor who only allows 14 day return for full credit, its to late when the gift is opened""!!"
2,uggs,I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot. With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in. Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour.
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the quality of these. These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them, the sole has ripped away from the boot. I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product. I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke."
3,from SHOE PLANET,"Because of issues of authenticity, I wrote to SHOE PLANET if these UGG is fake or not. This is their reply:""We only sell authentic merchandise and we are an authorized dealer to sell UGG'S. I understand your concern however, I can assure you that these came directly from the UGG manufacturer. I would recommend only buying from reputable sellers through web sites that you have heard of such as Amazon. There are guidelines that we are required to follow to prove the items are authentic. If the price is too good to be true they will almost always be fake merchandise, so be cautious about that. Please let us know if you have any additional questions.""You be the judge......"
5,Original Uggs are Awesome!,These original Uggs boots are simply the best and very much worth the few extra dollars!
3,Great product...not so great shipper,"I love UGG boots...this pair is my second. However, I am not happy with EastBay, the shipper. They shipped me the wrong product and then took three and a half weeks to send me the right product. I had to continuously email them about the status of the shipment...very annoying. I love the boots though...so soft and comfortable."
4,uggs,"I brought the women's classic tall ugg boots for my daughter for christmas she love them, she stated they were so warm and cozy also comfortable. only thing she hope they start widening the upper part of the boot, some of us have bigger calfs than others."
1,Why?,"UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear. Why are they popular? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not. If she does, its an automatic NO. Uggs are ugly, cheap, and really just gross. Dont waste your $. Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs."
3,Made cheaper than they used to be...,"I have a pair of UGGS that are over 16 years old. They were made in New Zealand and of higher quality. Now UGGS are made in China and it shows/feels. After verifying authenticity and trying on my boots...they feel so flimsy, but what can one do?My old pair finally started to wear out on the inside behind the heel. They are still ok with a double pair of socks, but I wanted a taller pair of boots. The toes on my old boots are reinforced with another strip of suede. It feels really strange putting on my new ones as they don't have that reinforcement and feels like it will wear out over time in the toes.Hopefully I will be proved wrong."
3,Uggs,The boots are warm as expected in uggs however not as comfortable as expected especially in the heal area. Major drawback is that black sheepskin stains feet black.
1,Way overpriced,"Seriously, they sell the same boots at Costco for $38.95. I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME (sheep skin and everything). Way overpriced."
2,Too loose,"Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk. I normally take a size 9 AA shoe. I tried a size 8 (my daughter's boots, which had already stretched), but they cramped my toes. I really wish they came in half sizes, because with the correct size, they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers."
5,Be careful when washing,"It's just fine as UGGs should be. Be sure you READ the instructions when washing them cos if you use the washing lotion directly to the shepkin,Uggs'll just fade.Mine's go tten a little bid lighter though."
1,Fake Uggs!!!!,They sell fake Uggs simply put. Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal!!!Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms.
2,A poor imitation of an Ugg,This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg. Not cozy. I'm returning it.
5,So Very Comfortable and Warm,"When I first saw these boots a few years back, I didn't like the look. However, one day I actually tried them on and omg, they felt so good, comfortable, warm. I live in a warm state, but often travel to cold states so these boots really come in handy. They aren't cute, but they don't need to be. :-) Love these boots!"
3,Still checking them out,"I bought these for my granddaughter who received another pair form someone else. There is a slight difference on the bottom of the boots, the inside fur, the way the tags are sewn on the back of heel and inside, the feel of the outside suade, and also the seams. I have heard about fakes so I am checking it out carefully. They both look good but the differences made us stop and think about who is selling fake ones. It's a crime to do so...but I will report it if I find out they are fake.Any tips are more than welcomed."
3,I think they were used.,When I took them out of the box they looked okay. I threw the box out but when I put them on last night I noticed that the fronts were scuffed a little. The packing was not in the two shoes. This is my fourth pair from amazons and was never disappointed. If I order again from amazons I will check more closely before throwing out the box.
1,VERY disappointed,"I bought the black ones and they are horrible, they are NOT sheepskin, they have more of a synthetic feel to them. They are VERY stiff when trying them on. I already have the brown ones (not bought from Amazon) so i knew right away that these had to be fake. They are in no way, ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs. The fur was not soft like the ones i have, and they are very uncomfortable. I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before, and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website."
2,A little concerned about them being real Uggs because....,When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn. My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real. I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller. For $200.00 I expect a fresh product.
5,I got these boots several years ago and they still look good as new,"These are wonderfully warm and comfortable boots that really last. I got these boots when they first came out and there was a mad rush to buy every time they were in the stores. Guess what? The early adopters like me are still buying these boots when the furor's not quite as hot as it once was.So--how are my Uggs Classics holding up? On the outside, they still look good as new. The sheepskin insole is felting at the toes, but for less than $[...], I can get a new insole.These are great boots and like me, you will probably keep them as favorites for years. Yes, I add a new pair of Uggs to my closet every year. I initially balked at the price, but these boots honestly have held up a lot better than many other shoes I've had and they're the most comfortable thing around for people with cold feet!Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
1,MADE IN CHINA COMPANY NAME IS SHOECENTRAL DON'T BUY THEM,"I PURCHASED THE BOOTS, THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS, THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG'S LOGO ON THE BOX. THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER. WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE. THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS (I PACKED THEM). KNOW I'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT...THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA. WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING."
5,Excellent transaction,"The boots arrived as promised, within the dates specified. They were exactly what we ordered. Good transaction. Thank you."
3,Unsure!,"I already had black tall classic uggs but wanted tan ones to utilize my wardrobe a bit more during the winter months. I like the product, however am not a fan of the vendor. I placed my order on Monday and the item did not ship until Thursday...why such a long wait? I understand that Amazon has to forward the order to the vendor but I have ordered several things over the past year that amazon did not stock directly and still had my order ship within no more than 48 hours. The boots are comfy but don't seem to be as nice as my black ones...half wondering if they are fake at this point but we'll see."
4,Tall Classic Ugg Boots,Great warm boot. Perfect for indoor/outdoor comfort. Have worn shorter ugg and knockoff ugg boots before. Love these tall ones!
2,Fabric RIPPED after 1 month of use,"I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems. Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on. If the fabric was REAL suede, this should not have happened. Therefore, I believe they are fake. Good job guys, you fooled me. But I was forced to file a claim on you. I will not be buying from this seller again. I don't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again. Too many fakes out there. Very convincing though."
1,Chinese or what??,Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam??
3,Ugg boots,"I bought for my daughter, she loves the boots, they came quickly, which was very important to her. We are very pleased with the product and the service."
1,defective boots,These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe.
1,Warm but wet,"Careful when buying these boots. They may look like they are built for winter weather, but most are only built for cold, NOT FOR WET. Whether it's snow, or slush, or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles. Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware."
3,UGGs ??,I took a chance and purchased these as a Christmas gift. When I bought them I was not 100% sure they were real UGGs or not. When I contacted UGG they told me this company is not an authorized dealer and cautioned me that these might be knock-offs. When they arrived I noticed that these boots were made in China. I found that there are several dealers selling a lot of these on the internet and they are shipped from China. According to UGG and other sources (Norton for one)they are selling counterfeit boots. Bottom line is that so far these appear to be of good quality but I am still unsure if they are the real deal or knock-offs that are over priced.
4,omg i love them,i love them they are so comfortable. i wish i had ordered another color. the best boot ever bought. great
3,It's Okay,The purchase was for a gift. Personally if I had made the purchase for myself I would have preferred that the boots were water-resistant. I think they are priced too high for not being suitable for winter type weather
1,Not Authentic Uggs or Really Bad Quality,Uggs are not what we expected. Appearded to be fakes. Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago. Will not buy from this site again. Will try the actual Uggs website.
2,Not so happy.,"The boots arrived on time, When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes. It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots, no thank you. I just won't be ordering from them again."
5,Love them,Love them but definitely order smaller. I wear 8 1/2 so I ordered an 9. Way too big. I sent them back and bought size 8 - they are perfect. Amazon was helpful with the returning/exchanging process.
1,HOLE after a couple of weeks!,My daughter has been asking for these for ages. Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas. She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them. A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems.
5,Love my UGG'S,"Delivery was prompt and I finally received just what I ordered. It took me 3 tries to get these. First 2 times the store sent me the wrong color. Amazon was wonderful with the return, couldn't have asked for better service. The third time Amazon used a different fulfillment store and I got just what I wanted. They're so comfortable and keep my feet toasty warm and yet cool at the same time. I wore them in CO and the days were warm and yet my feet felt cool, and when the temp went down at nite, while the tips of my ears were cold, my feet were toasty warm and without sweating. Although a little pricey, I'd recommend these to everyone."
3,are this ugg boots real,can someone tell me if this uggs are real i need to know asap so i can buy them so can anyone reply fast plz
3,Mediocre,"Being a female college student, I felt a necessity to own a pair or two of Uggs. Everybody wears them, but after my first winter in Michigan, I don't really understand why. Although they are super warm, they aren't waterproof (sucks for slushy days and wet snow), they don't have good traction (difficult to walk on snow and ice), and being made of sheepshin, they're difficult to clean. The salt put on the roads here damages them. I own the Ugg cleaning/care kit, and even that isn't enough to keep my Uggs looking good.I wouldn't recommend these for anyone who lives in a snowy place. Invest in some real snowboots."
1,IRREGULAR UGGS,"I had to return these boots (at my expense!) because they were irregular; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right, it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit.. don't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it; so I don't understand why the seller ship it to me....ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store; and of course the shipping for the return was on me!!!So I paid bit over $10.00 just to look at some damaged boots!!!"
5,Ugg tall boots,My wife loves the boots and her friends and daughter-in-law were very impressed.Ordering the boot was easy and the price was a little cheaper than I could have received at the mall.
4,Like Walking on Clouds - Sizing Seems a Bit Big,"These boots were purchased to replace a pair I bought four years ago (which I wore on the regular until holes in the soles forced me to throw them away). New, they are just as soft and warm as I remember. The boots seem to fit slightly differently than my originals. I had/have a 10 in both. The new boots seem to fit a bit bigger than the originals. Even so, I am happy and eventually I'll stop tripping over that extra centimeter of boot."
2,Dye comes off,"First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes!!! The boots never dried back to their natural color, insted, the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days. Don't really know what happened. Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem. Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I wouldn't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I wouldn't expect what happened..."
2,Seem ripped the second time boots were worn.,"I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem. I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter. The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on, leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS."
2,worst uggs,"I have three other pairs and this is the worst. it's called ""tall"" uggs. Oh, they're unpleasantly short. mid calf. also, uncomfortable! They bunch right around the ankle. Are these even real uggs? I'm going to have to check for authenticity. didn't like these."
3,I love them - but they tore a little within a week,"I love Uggs - they aren't the prettiest of shoes, but they're insanely comfortable and warm. This is the fourth pair I've owned, and I bought the size I've always bought, but when I put them on the second or third time, the left boot tore a little next to the seam in the back! That has never happened before. I sewed the tear up myself and it looks fine, but these shoes aren't cheap and I expected higher quality. Maybe Ugg' standards have slipped in recent years - my last pairs lasted a few harsh winters each."
5,Ugg boots,The shoes walk like heaven shoes. The product itself is really good. The shipment only took forever.
2,Incoherent Science Fiction,"Phylum Monsters begins with an interesting premise. The year is 2345 (in that order) and genetic engineering has yielded a population of varied and designer beings aiding, abetting and living as and with humanity.It could get interesting.Instead the book weaves through a hodgepodge of Martian rock entities, 2 Pontiffs, modern primitives in Arkansas, a harem in Africa, 'Southworld' savages... with a long dead beauty and regression in the genetic creatures.There's more, but why confuse anybody!Phylum Monsters has little in the way of coherence or logic to recommend it to potential readers."
5,"Love it, love it","The scent is just as attractive as the bottle it comes in. It's a girly, sweet, luscious smell. Doesn't have the yucky alcohol smell some perfumes have.I wish I got the bigger bottle, I can see myself using this up quite quick!"
5,Lovely scent,"I have had this for many years, lasts a long time and doesnt seem to get that old smell even after five years. It is very unique and the scent has a 'rich quality' to it. The scent seems to change as the day goes on, I really like it."
4,People Love It or Hate It,"I like it, but it is VERY sweet and VERY strong. Cute bottle, too--best I have seen in ages. Probably should be worn by younger (than I) women and not if they are going to be riding in a plane or an elevator. This scent elicits some strong reactions."
4,Unique.....ok-fantasic.,"I just got it today, first the bottle is unique, like an apple the apple stem has an opening where the spray is, I thought it was a cap...lol, different, but it adds a personality-concept to my perfume collection, which I like...diversity.The smell at first reminded me of sweet grapes...when I sprayed it on my skin, but then it adherents to your chemistry and becomes like a sweet nectar or a heighten touch of vanilla... a sweetness of flowers... with a light element of must and violets. I truly like the uniqueness to it.---OveRall---The strength is more of a sweet vanilla touch to it, the scent I would say last maybe more than a few hours and just dissipates down more after that..which is cool with me...it's overall a keeper in my book.-Let's just say it does it's job..to be enchanting.:)"
5,I love my floormats,"I got the seat covers to replace ones I had gotten in a local store and worn out. I saw the floormats and got them too. They fit my VW good, they have a nice hard surface so all the dirt doesn't embed in the carpet fiber and they look great with my seat covers-not too overdone-with just the single design motif."
4,A simple good mouse.,"I've had a couple of these now as well as having had a couple other from different companies including one from Microsoft. This AOpen mouse is by far my favorite. It's simple, feels good, the buttons are all well placed and responsive."
5,The thing that has been missing from my hand...,"A few years back I owned the original model of this mouse without usb support. It really grew into me, especially with its lack of oversensitivity on the top click buttons (I'll admit the side two can be more than easy to accidentally hit), dual roller balls, and overall smooth movement. This is an excellent mouse for gaming, even with its low dpi compared to actual gaming class mice due to its 5 button status. The two on top, two side buttons, and the top roller has a click. Windows does an excellent job of giving the side buttons the default ability to scroll back and forth through webpages when you are surfing (left and right moving to their respective browser arrows), and many games will automatically assign functions to the extra buttons.Bottom line: Get this mouse while you can, definitely worth the price.Side note: This mouse is actually out of production now, all the more reason to swipe one ASAP."
2,"Good Mouse, short life","Well the heading says it all I think. The mouse performed admirably with no problems for about nine months and then over the course of 8 hours it lost the ability to track movement. Literally,. I shut the computer down , went to bed for the night,. I woke up, turned on the PC and my mouse cursor was stationary. IT still registered clicks mind you.So I've currently had to go back to me previous 5-button which in a twist was an earlier model of this exact same device... maybe about 2 iteration cycles older, a mouse which had served me well for about 3 years and now continues to do so, with a few spasms of noncooperation here and there.I must say I am disappointed and I'd give this a flat out 1 or half star if it weren't for the fact that it worked well while it did and this might just be my bad luck."
1,Perry Como,"I love Perry, I wish you would have at least given the list of tracks on this album. Thanks"
3,Was Expecting More,"I'm a huge fan of Tom Savini's work. Even met the guy a while ago whileFrom Dusk till Dawnwas out. The guy is REALLY incredible at making blood and guts look real! With years of experience (and time in Vietnam as a photographer), he knows his stuff.So when I came across this little film I was expecting something more than what I got. It's not horrible; I certainly learned a few things about many of his less popular movies. It's basically him in his studio with director John Russo (Midnight,Dark Craving, and I haven't seen either of these films) talking about how he comes up with ideas. It's interesting, but hardly educational.You're probably better off with something likeMonster Make Up Hosted by Dick Smith, but since I haven't seen that either, I couldn't tell you.If you're looking for a little insight into Savini's work, without much as to HOW he does it, then this VERY SHORT film is for you."
3,Not Quite What I'd Expected,"Being a fan of Savini's work and having an interest in makeup effects, I requested (and received) this as a birthday present. A few things that ought to be noted.First, this DVD is ripped from an interview shot in 1987, with the slightly murky video quality of the era- it looks like footage from a local cable channel.Secondly, while the product description drops hints that this is an instructional video, it's more of an interview interspersed with shots of the effects in action- that is to say, there are only the vaguest descriptions as to the construction and workings of each. There's some brief talk about how each was made, and typically some shot of the end result (with some neat backstage archival footage), and the stories he tells are fun, but if you're looking for makeup instruction, you may want to keep looking."
1,Don't buy,"I got this as a present & i'm sad that someone wasted their money on it. It says ""Learn the techniques of the legendary make-up artist..."" but there are not demos, no instructions, just cheesy stories about mostly animatronics (which is not makeup) & squibs (again, not makeup.)Complete waste of time & money. Lame."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this based on the review that says this DVD is great, has a lot of xtras, etc. This DVD only has two extras - a lame photo gallery and a behind the scenes feature. There is only two girl on girl scenes and the women featured are not what I would call hot. I was really looking forward to this video, but to tell you the truth, I fast forwarded through most of it. If you want a hot Penthouse video, try the first Pets in Paradise or Harlets of Hell. Pets 2 just isn't worth it."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.........,"PETS IN PARADISE 2 IS A BIG LET DOWN.AFTER WATCHING THE SUPERB ORIGINAL PETS IN PARADISE, IEXPECTED THE FOLLOW UP TO BE AS GOOD, OR EVEN BETTER.THIS D.V.D HAS SEVERAL FAULTS.THE PICTURE IS NOT CLEAR (FILM LIKE APPERARANCE),NOT ENOUGH CHAPTERS, TOO EXPLICIT, TOO ""ARTY"",AND GENERALLY DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.THIS IS ONE TO STAY AWAY FROM.IF YOU DON'T ALREADY OWN IT, BUY THE ORIGINAL.OTHERWISE, GET "" PET OF THE YEAR 2000"" OR"" PET OF THE YEAR 2001 PLAYOFF, OR "" PENTHOUSEGENTLEMAN'S CLUB ""YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
2,GOOD IF YOU LIKE SPITTING :(,"I'm appalled with this DVD,Pets In Paradise 1 is a masterpiece,but this DVD is horrid. First off why on earth did Penthouse get nasty Devon(a pornstar with so many tatoos I lost count)and why would they not edit out her spitting and lose the [adult] toys even though they not used their are still annoying. Secondly why let Juliet only have 2 tame and short scenes when she is the only positive thing going for this DVD. Also Suzette looks very cheap and low class in this film when I have seen her in real life and she is very pretty. I could only give this 2 stars because so much potential wasted but worth looking at for the 2 scenes of Juliet,I would recomend PET OF THE YEAR 2000 WINNER IF YOUR A FAN OF JULIET LIKE ME INSTEAD OF THIS DVD."
2,"Good book, but not as good as prior editions","I had a chance to listen Dr. Baum's seminars and presentations. I also have the 3rd edition of this book. I am his fan. He is a smart marketing person.However, the fouth edition of his book is not the same as priors were. Simply, this book is to long and not to the point. I purchased it, hoping to get some valuable, new information or help, but did not find them. Sorry, Dr Baum, this book is not good enough.We, physicians, are burden with many daily tasks and need more effective and short guide how to market our office and services. We often do not have resources and time to hire professional marketer(s). IF we had them, we would not need this book."
5,A must have for any medical and dental (or any specialty) doctor and manager,"This book, by far, is the ultimate guide to medical marketing with ideas and concepts you can simply implement right away with little cost and effort. No rhetoric but time tested concepts! An easy read and will help to create a road map for internal and external marketing, public and community relations and improving your relationship with your office staff. As a national speaker (Chairman of the American Academy of Podiatric Practice Management ) and author this book helps me to develop and share secrets of success."
1,MARKETING YOUR CLINICAL PRACTICE,"i have not receive my book, i am angry because i pay and i dont receive that you promise. My brother live there in Usa AND GO TO CALL TO YOU BECAUSE I AM VERY INSATISFIED WITH YOU"
3,Better than I remembered,"I hadn't seen this one in a while, as the later Dr. Who seasons didn't get shown much in my area. This is from Sylvester McCoy's first season. During this time Dr. Who entered a bit of a silly period, and I expected not to like this one but I did. The juxtaposition of a holiday camp in Wales in 1959 and invaders from outer space made for an odd little story. Even though it did get a little silly at times, it also would turn on a dime and get serious. It's not one of the best Dr. Who adventures by any strech of the imagination, but one that i found highly enjoyable and entertaining."
1,Bottom of the Barrel Bannermen,"In retrospect, it's not surprising that the Sylvester McCoy era killed Doctor Who, with 'Delta and the Bannermen' being a prime example of why. Attempting to stage a third-rate version of 'Grease' (and failing even that), 'Delta' only succeeds in avoiding the gargantuan plotholes found in most McCoy stories (ie 'Silver Nemesis'). It's sad really, since the chemestry between McCoy and Langford had strong potential that went largely untapped until their reunion in the 2000 'Fires of Vulcan' audio adventure.It you're seriously interested in getting into Doctor Who, DO NOT buy this video. However, if you're an old hand with the series and want something to watch with your pals at a drunken party, this is the one for you. You'll definitely be laughing at it, not with it..."
5,My students & I loved it!,"After watching the movie ""Our Friend Martin,"" I am going to buy this CD to play in my classroom. My students and I loved the movie and the music in it."
1,These particular highlighters run out of ink way too fast,These particular BIC highlighters (in this particular single-color 12-highlighter configuration) run out of ink way faster than their other BIC brite liner highlighters (which also run out of ink way too fast). Very disappointing. Source: Graduate student who highlights textbooks every day.
4,11 yr old daughter loves these dragons!,"11 yr old daughter loves these dragons! She is working on getting each one available. And at 40 yrs old myself, even I think they're cool!"
3,Works for many...not me,"I really wanted this plan to work for me. I loved the premise; fast for the day and enjoy the freedom of eating hearty at night. Worked for my grocery budget because I wasn't eating a lot during the day. I've been a vegetarian for almost a year, no processed foods, very little sugar, etc. The bottom line is that I don't think that this diet is for all body types, blood types and metabolisms. Many have had great success and that's good for them. I have been on this for about a little over a month and haven't lost much weight. I'm forced to go back to grazing during the day which is what has worked for me in the past. For some, the calories in/calories burned rule holds true.My advice is to get the book and try it. If it doesn't work, go back to what has worked for you in the past."
2,Don't buy the hype,"There are plenty of people looking for ways to lose fat...or get lean. If you have already grooved your workout habits and can't miss a tough workout each day...this plan might help you get lean...but this is not for bodybuilders.If you don't want to ask why the diet works...then go for it. However, I thought the dietary premises to lack real thought...poorly supported by data...and not very helpful. Hofmekler wants you to just trust him. When it comes to maximizing the investment that you already make in working out...I would suggest Fit for Life or Zone books to better explain nutrition programs."
3,Jury's still out,"I am not morbidly obese, and neither do I have insulin resistance, but virtually every nutritionist and physician I've talked with has told me I have to eat 6+ times a day. All I have ever found was that eating made me more hungry, so this ""once a day"" book looked intriguing. In reality, it's a bit too complicated and new age (eat ""live foods"", whatever that means). One testimonial (inside the booK!) that scared me a bit was from a woman who said that after conscientiously following the diet for two years (!) she started to feel wonderful. I'm not sure I can consistently follow his plan for two years to feel an improvement."
2,Disappointed,"Basically Ori Hofmekler touches some controversial topics in ""The Warrior Diet"" such as stubborn fat, the layers of fat around the waistline and under the pecs, fat that refuses to disappear no matter what you do. But the Warrior Diet does NOT necessarily help to lose stubborn fat AND maintain a lean muscular body.Fact is that this eating regimen will make you look EMACIATED in the long run.And it is not recommendable to bodybuilders or people who exercise regularly. Also its alleged anti aging effect is more than questionable. Hofmekler has some good points but ignores too many facts about modern nutrition.Also I have not found any hint as to whether he is a certified nutrition expert. His bio states that he worked as a cartoonist.I cannot recommend this diet as it had me lose muscle and strenght. Also the claims about increased sex drive and ""romantic"" passion are ludicrous."
2,No money left for food,"This book has some interesting ideas but would be much better if the author would tell you how to implement the diet without having to use all the supplements he recommends. Warrior-zyme, warrior-milk, warrior-growth serum, minerals, probiotics, and more. There's an order form at the back of the book with prices. Buying from the books source, the minimum he advises taking, I came up with $740. for a months supply. Yes, you read that right and bear in mind this is the minimum he advises. I called the 800 number on the order form and guess what? Those supplements are no longer even available from dragon door (the publisher)."
3,"Hit & Miss, depending....","This diet is good, with some caveats. First, you will not adapt to it overnight, it takes a few weeks to a few months. If you are doing high volume training, you will probably have to alter either the diet or the training. Basically, to make this work, you have to be super flexible with it. I enjoy his writing style, laugh at his notions of history and his acceptance of instinct and sociobiology, and am horrified by the section on exercise (It's apallingly bad, don't waste your time. Barbells, Kettlebells, or bodyweight, but not the ""warrior workout""). The hardest part about this diet is the family/social factor. If you're single, it is dead easy to do, though."
2,Save your money,"I followed this diet plan to the letter for 8 days and didn't seen any weight loss. I wonder if was because I'd weigh myself in the morning after ""pigging out"" the night before. Shoot, Jenny Craig helped me lose 7 pounds in my first week. The author says his program slows down aging. How? You wouldn't know it by looking at his face. Or at least from what you can see of it. What's with the shadowy photos? It would help if this book were more research based instead of philosophically appealing to warrior wannabes. Ori states you should drink 8 glasses of water a day. Wouldn't that tax your kidneys? Dr. Campbell at Real Health states it would. Kidneys have to do with water regulation in the body. They can give you a dried up look (like the author's) if they aren't functioning well. I don't know. The author isn't even a health professional. How do we know he knows anything about what he's talking about? Save your money and go with Fit for Life."
4,Good,"As usual in the writing is very good, if somewhat dated, in attitude due I suspect in part to being somewhat older and of the generation that considered sexuality a facet of human experience to be a private and non-discussed matter. Still the author remains a talented practitioner of the writing art."
5,Absolutely the best gift for cat lovers,"If you want to be delighted, moved, and inspired, run to buy this book! And you won't find a better gift for all your cat loving friends. The Wisdom of Yo Meow Ma is engaging and entertaining, but at it's heart it is a book full of profound spiritual insight. Joanna Sandsmark is a gifted writer. Do yourself a favor and don't pass this one up."
1,Male Cow Excrement - B S Watson,"I have this book and I know drawing techniques (not in this book), this book provides little credibility and I fail to see how Scholastic Inc can promote it let a lone distribute it. I would not recommend this book at all to anyone learning to draw... BUT I would recommend it to the children that use it to trace or colour-in; namely the children that gave this book a ridiculously high review - that or just fans of the DBz site (children that don't understand the importance of accurate reviews)."
1,absolutely AWFUL,"Considering i am in Australia and the exchange rate really pushes up the prices of these videos for me, i can state emphatically that this time i would of been better to buy a lottery ticket. It would of given me more excitement when the little coloured balls dropped.This movie is Terrible. DONT BOTHER TO PAY FOR THIS MOVIE.No real script, the acting is terrible and i had a hard time even bearing with it to see it through to the end. What end ? yes exactly.Another women in prison failed movie.I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It's about time Liz learns a lesson!,If I was Todd and Devon I wouldn't talk to Liz ever again. Jessica has to learn to keep out of her bussiness! This was a good book.
4,THE MOST ACTION-PACKED S.V.H IN THE CENTURY!,"I love SVH books and at first this Devon/prom thing was fun. But honestly! It's just slightly, repeditive, huh!!? I mean, why can't Liz make up her mind? And when are Jess and Li going to stop their convinning little ways? I think Todd's soppy and pathetic and Devon's cool and passionate and smart. And Courtney!! That little witch! She should be eliminated from the series! An absolutely MAD nigth of date-swapping, confrontations, hysteria, romance and anger! Although the tiniest bit 'again, and again' I can't wait to get my hands on the next!"
4,It was pretty good I 'd say,I think it would been better if Devon Would just go out with Jessica then it would be all good . I can't wait to see what's going to happen in the next book with Courtney and everyone else.
3,Liz: Make up your mind!,"I wish Elizabeth would stay with Devon or make up her mind. Lila and Jess need to stop being so conceited and get over it! IT was an okay book, and I CANNOT Wait until the next one!!"
4,Very Good,The second book in the Prom Weekend series was very good.Jessica and Lila got ditched on Prom night and Jessica disguised herself as Elizabeth to keep Devon to herself all night.And I really wish Devon would get his mind and heart of Elizabeth.Todd should be with Elizabeth anyway and Courtney Kane finally got what she deserved.
4,Suprisingly good,"""Tuesday the Rabbi Saw Red"" is one of the best mysteries out there. It takes place mainly on a Massachusetts college campus during the Vietnam era. Kemelman opens up with pieces of information that seem irrelevant, but everything falls into place. There is a clear plot, a defined theme, and the characters are real. This book will keep you wondering ""whodunit"" until the end."
4,Another fine mystery,"This is my 2nd Kemelman book, and I wasn't disappointed. He manages to weave in a considerable amount of information on Judaism with an intriguing mystery & quite a bit on human psychology while keeping the reader admirably entertained. He does provide enough clues to figure out the mystery--but here they are quite subtle. I finally got the murderer but not exactly how it was done. This is a very fine book in a very fine series. Probably worth a bit more than 4 stars. I plan to read the rest of the series. Enjoy!"
3,Malkmus diverges a little from his standard fare,"Everyone wants Stephen Malkmus to sound just like Pavement did in the good old days. And for the most part on his first solo album, he does. This is the second single off that album, and Jenny & The Ess Dog sounds like it could be Pavement, except that this song is (gasp!) actually in narrative form. The remaining songs, however, are an interesting departure from Malkmus. ""That's What Mama Said"" is a long, guitar jam, ""Alien Boy"" is a cover of an old punk song by The Wipers (and it sounds an awful lot like early Nirvana, and ""Keep The Faith"" is more of a crowd sing-along type song than anythign else. Malkmus exploring the kind of music he grew up loving isn't a bad thing, it's just different. And while this is one of those cd's I'll buy and only listen to once in a while, it's a great cd to add to a collection."
3,Disconnected Chapters,I thought this book was broken into two disconnected parts that did not work well together-- the trials of Bridget Cleary and the historical happenings during this time period. I found myself skimming through the chapters that detailed the history of Ireland during this time period and looking forward to the chapters related to Bridget Cleary. This novel was too much like a school textbook with boring and wandering descriptions of the historical times of Ireland. The relevancy of these historical descriptions to the trials of Bridget Cleary was exaggerated by the authors.
4,good readin',well written account of a murder ain the tun of the century ireland. tells not only of the murder but also of the history of the period. really interesting insight into rural ireland and the belief in fairies. a very good read.
4,"Nice, Heavy","This unit has tons of power and torque for many uses. It's not lightweight can cause some fatigue, but it's a monster for many uses. Don't worry about dead batteries, just plug it in. Recommended."
4,Lots of torque - Great drill,"I bought this drill refurbished to mix thin set and grout for the ceramic tile floor I installed in my kitchen. A few minor scratches on it, but it performs just like new. This drill exceeded my expectations. This a heavy duty unit with tons of torque to mix thin set and grout with ease. It also a relatively compact size for the power output. I have a 12"" Hitachi cut off miter saw (13 years old) and it has been great. Best of all, you cannot beat the price for this drill. I highly recommend it."
5,tougher than ***l,"I bought this recently from Lowes for $89. Now that I have used it for stirring 10 5 gallon buckets of stucco, I'd pay $130 for it. This thing got so hot mixing such thick cement the first time or two that white hot smoke rolled out of it and the smell of burning wiring made my wallet start to ache. I didn't care I had to get that stucco up. I thought for sure I was killing it with such a hard job. By the end of my tenth bucket it only smoked a little if I kept mixing past 6 minutes or so. To my suprise, after using that thing like I stole it, it doesn't even seem close to dying. One tough drill. I don't just like it. I admire it."
4,"Good heavy duty drill, but...","This is a very good heavy duty drill, but the buttons for forward/reverse and the constant ""on"" button are poorly located. It is way too easy to trigger either of them inadvertantly when using the drill. Even so, I would probaly buy it again."
2,Not for Leftys,"Great drill. Lot's of power. Nice brake. Two finger trigger..... BUT. This drill is a nightmare for left handed folks. The forward/reverse switch is in the way of my left hand grip, so I am always slamming the thing into reverse when I don't want to."
3,Fairly good,"Not that deep into the history, but it covers what is necessary. It was a good review of High School, but written better with a bit higher reading level."
2,BARBIE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER.,"THIS POISON IVY DOLL HAS A BEAUTIFUL FACE & HEAD OF HAIR,BUT THATS REALLY WHERE THE PLUS'S STOP. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A JOINTED BODY,INSTEAD SHE HAD A RUBBER WIRE FILLED BODY & ASIDE FROM HER HEAD THAT TURNS FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE REST OF HER IS MADE FROM ONE SOLID PIECE OF PLASTIC/RUBBER SO HER ARMS WON'T MOVE AT THE SHOULDER OR AT THE HIPS,IT'S LIKE A ""BENDY"" TOY. THE OUTFIT IS LOW QUAILTY."
1,Too skimpy,"My children have to buy fashions that cover the shoulders and knees. When they take their dolls out of the house, they put something on the dolls that cover their head. In our opinion, this doll is too skimpy, and i'm returning it immediatly."
5,A wonderful way to learn!,"Project-Based Learning with Young Children is obviously written by good teachers for good teachers. The book is well-organized and easy to read. It suggests ways of working with children that are very respectful of children and the learning process. The best parts of this book are the true-to-life stories of real children doing real work. Diffily and Sassman weave their own experiences working on projects with young children, as well as bringing in ""voices"" of other project-based learning teachers. I strongly recommend Project-Based Learning with Young Children to any K-1-2 teacher who is looking for authentic ways of teaching young children."
5,(Chilling Stories from) Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone,"Rod Serling was a visionary, far, far ahead of anyone writing fiction at that time, with his stories of robots taking the place of humans for companionship, basic human rights-whomever you were, an Air Force mission ending up on an alternate, but,oh so, different earth.'The House On The Square' and 'The Riddle of The Crypt' are two of my favorites...since I was ten years old! I have six of Mr. Serling's books and each story in each volume is not going to be like anything you've ever read.Find a Rod Serling book- - -buy a Rod Serling book.It's that simple and each one will have you wondering about some people's incredible ability to go way, way out on a limb...and disappear from the limb altogether."
3,Just another Marvel essential,"Like all of the Marvel essentials, it's a lot of material for a low price. But it's in black and white and a really low quality paper. It's worth buying if you want to check the origins of Ghost Rider and not pay too much for it."
1,Snooze-Fest,"In all the modern comics Ghost Rider is awesome! He's a bad-ass who avenges the innocent and rides an awesome bike and has all the powers of hell behind him in his quest.In this comic he's a whiny emo punk who flip flops at the drop of a hat. One minute he loves his girlfriend, the next minute he hates her and wants her as far away from him as possible. One second he won't obey Satan and he'll fight him until his last breath and in the next second he's willing to do his bidding as long as he spares his girlfriend.I made it about a third of the way through this and then I had to stop because it was soooo BORING! Seriously! Nothing happens in this thing! It's just him sitting around moping for most of the comic!I just can't recommend it to anyone. The only good part of this comic is that it looks good on my shelf. Don't waste your money."
5,Top Notch Noir,"I had previously read Manchette's other translated book, Three to Kill, and gave it a four star review. As The Prone Gunman is even better still, it warrants the full five stars. This is what noir is all about - a lean plot and lots of action. Indeed, I started reading the book one night, lost track of the body count, was amazed at the thrills and was shocked to discover I was only on page 48.The plot revolves around a hired killer who is looking to retire and hook back up with the girl he had left behind some years before. Of course, nothing goes as planned. The family of a prior hit is after him, his bosses do not want him to retire and our ""hero"" himself is simply emotionally unprepared for a normal existence. Added to this is that the characters with whom he interacts are all morally vacuous. A reader will not find any sentimentality in this book. He will, however, find a lot of excitement."
4,Not that bad at all...,"The dvd begins with some words from the producer, it is followed by an ad that lasts a couple of minutes, while that didn't really add anything to it, it wasn't so long as to affect the other segments as has been claimed. The conference is not there in it's entirety, but the dvd doesn't claim that it is.This was not a big preaching production but really just a taping of a few segments where the focus is on being transported to behind the veil/worship, prayer etc It has a very strong presence of the Holy, not just of the anointing but also of the Holy. It seems like the videos were poorly produced though in that they don't respond to the controls and switches on the dvd player well at all, but the content is there as promised.I know I had to fiddle a lot to get it.It really isn't her best, but it definitely isn't her worst.Read the back cover carefully and decide if this is what you're really looking for.It's all there and it is a blessing as always."
1,Disappointment,"I was so excited to get the DVD, but was quickly disappointed by the content. I expected to be viewing the conference and to my surprise it was only the Intro by the Producer, Scene Selections, Bonus Features and Credits. I never really got to see the conference itself. The precessional was good and Dr. Bynum's singing glorified the presenting of the art, but absolutely did not satify my expectation of this DVD. I have many other older and newer DVDs of Dr. Juanita Bynum and her husband Bishop Thomas Weeks, III that I am overjoyed with as well as books from the both of them. Again this DVD was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! If you are looking to be moved by the message, please do not purchase this DVD."
5,The Bomb !!,I have never given a review but this mat IS the BOMB! It's just the best mat you can get for the money. I'm buying another one now. It's pricey but well worth it. You WON'T be disapointed.
2,Hold the phone,"The Jorgensen web site adjustableclamp.com is selling two of these for $6.99 plus shipping. Amazon wants $19.90 for one with free shipping. I don't think it will cost $33 to ship from Jorgensen.I have a very difficult time getting these to clamp down tight. Constantly adjusting the screw nut underneath my workbench. I have only used these one time, and finally gave up. It may be me!"
5,Nice Blend,"Mostly lesser known artists on this compilation. HOWEVER, these artists are better than most well known artists. Good blend of R&B and Rock tunes. If you are into what South Carolinians call ""Beach Music"" you will also enjoy this. Afterall, it does have Virginia Beach's Bill Deal and the Rhondells on here. Great feel good music for folks that don't like listening to cruddy music much like what is dominating today's airwaves."
3,Dodger is not so keen,This review is not about whether I like it because I dont use it! But more importantly neither does my ferret. So his vote is leaning toward a 1 or two star. But I will give this product benefit of the doubt in that Dodger has other places to sleep also. So this product may not be bad but not as good as the others I have. And remember this is just one ferrets opinion!
1,Dead on Arrival,"A goth kid makes a crappy 5 minute movie that everyone laughs at so he goes nuts. He gets into a beef with a jock and takes off in his car being chased by the jock. Eventually goth kid drives over a cliff. One year later, the teachers and students who mocked him start dying, each one leaving a clue as to who will die next.Now, forget you read all that because you are never going to want to sit through this dreck. I took the bullet for you. Stephen J. Cannell, who wrote Dead Above Ground, used to make cheesy tv shows like the A-Team and Rip Tide. The A-Team was Shakespeare compared to this movie. It has a plot so cliched and hackneyed a first year film student wouldn't write it. Atrocious dialog and God-awful acting round out this movie's demerits. Stay far away from this movie."
1,Makes you laugh!!,"Unfortunately, it's a horror movie, not a comedy, but it might as well be...I have one thought: I would think that, after hundreds of thousands of cliche, unbelievably predictable B horror movies have been made over and over, all following the same formulaic scripting, and all containing the same horrendous over-the-top cheeseball acting, that someone would say to these hopeless directors/producers, ""gee, ya know, we've seen this before--about a bajillion times, and it still sucks!"" This movie is BAD...very, very bad. One of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I usually enjoy bad horror movies. I think I may have even dropped a few IQ points having been subjected to this trash. The only thing that you may get out of it is the hilarity of making fun of it---this begs for the Mystery Science Theater 3000/Svengoolie treatment. Otherwise, a total waste of time. Just avoid it!"
2,uninspired,largely uninspired & somewhat disappointing - especially in comparison with the first verve/remixed-album which got my 2 thumbs way up. then already the second remixed-album was merely 'okay'. this one is 'so-so'. i picked the verve3/remixed/unmixed-version up @ chapters for 14.99 & can live with that... 2.5 starts from me. ;-))
4,chillin' & cookin',"I just discovered this series a week ago, and bought all six, remixed and unmixed. There seems to be strong opinions about Vol. 3, just released. Is it the best of the series, or the worst?If I may dumb-down the discussion, I hear ""slow songs"" and ""fast songs"" on each of three CD's, but relatively more ""fast songs"" on the latest release. That means everyone who prefers the dominant ""slow song"" sound of the first two CD's may find the new one annoying. But everyone who prefers the higher-energy ""fast songs"" will LOVE the latest release.I like both, one for chillin' and one for cookin'. So I've re-compiled the three Verve/Remixed CD's into two: one with the best slow songs; and one with the best fast songs. Try it, you'll like it."
2,pales by comparison to vol. I & II,"I rushed excitedly to buy this after really enjoying volumes one and two, only to find myself very disappointed... The remixes are very disjointed - there is no real common feel unlike the first two Cds in the series. One or two tracks stand out - the Sarah Vaughan / Peter Gunn theme is wonderful, but her 'fever' remix is weak... And the Nina Simone 'Lilac Wine' remix is just plain embarassing..."
5,better than the first two,"i was hoping this volume would be as good as the first two and i think i actually like it better than the other two...i highly recommend it!!!!!there's a nice balance of dance and chill tracks, some mixes are truly surprising and not what you'd expect."
2,Same problem as volume 2: insensitivity,"This third installment has the same problem as the quality-impaired second volume: it's insensitive to its source material.Once again we are treated to songs that sound like b-sides that the remixers had sitting in their closet and, given the option of applying some new jazz samples without financial recrimination, have merely dropped the source material in at key locations. This is not a re-envisioning of the original songs, nor is it ""21st century jazz music"". If you want to hear 21st century jazz music, pick up a Stefon Harris record. THIS record is an electronic record with jazz samples, and not a good one at that. Very little daring here, very few chanes taken, very stock stuff. The only songs that come close to meeting the original mission of this series are the too-short ""Yesterdays"" (Billie Holiday remixed by Junior Boys) and ""Lilac Wine"" (Nina Simone remixed by Album Leaf).The first volume remains the high point of this series."
1,The Most Tasteless/Ridiculous Remix,"The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the ""mixing DJs"" for the great vocalists:there is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart ""Do ya think i am sexy"" single cd instead."
2,Unfortunately... 2 stars. I had high hopes.,"As a big fan of Remixed 1 and 2, I was very excited to hear that 3 had come out. But upon listening to it, it turns out that I'm only keeping 6 out of the 13 tracks on my playlist. Little Girl Blue, Speak Low, Fever, The Gentle Rain, Peter Gunn and Stay Loose made the cut. Everything else was very discordant-sounding to my ears, with none of the electronic groove that I was used to on the other albums. My tastes may be too mainstream to truly appreciate the unusual choices made by the more experimental remixers."
2,Whoring of Timeless Artists,"This album is so artlessly remixed and disrepectful of the original artists as to be offensive. I excitedly anticipated listening to number 3 in the series. What a disappointment! There was no reason for this collection but to profit from the success of the first two. These hacks could have taken canned sound clips and remixed them to an album of near equal quality. I am pissed. Okay, there are a about three tracks that are pretty good, but that's far from acceptable as far as I'm concerned."
4,Eclectic mix...,"I love the Postal Service and Rjd2 remixes... my new favorites!! I heard the Bent remix on a local radio station, but was surprised when I heard how these different styles gel together. I didn't know some of these remixers, but now I might look for some of their other stuff. Who are the Sugardaddies!? My only complaint is the Cd gets a bit slow towards the end but overall it has a good balance. This would make a great party mix!"
2,Volume 3,"The first ""Verve/Remixed"" focused on Divas, mostly those of the Jazz genre. This third disc - like the second volume - deviates from that enjoyable formula by expanding to female pop singers, male vocalists, and instrumentalists.VERVE/REMIXED 3 consists of 13 newly remixed songs. Disc packaged in clear jewel case; total running time: 63:38. Booklet does not include information about the original recordings (not even songwriting credits).Once again, there are two Nina Simone recordings remixed. Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan both have two songs each. And Brazilian singer Astruid Gilberto appears once again.While containing less music (less 1 track and 10 minutes), this is a better collection than ""Verve/Remixed 2"". Sarah Vaughan's ""Peter Gunn"" is very fun; Nina Simone's ""Little Girl Blue"" is nice. But (one-half of Gnarls Barkley) DJ Danger Mouse's remix of ""Baby, Did You Hear?"" is weak; Dinah's vocals are barely audible. Surprisingly, Anita O'Day's ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" is rather enjoyable."
3,i'm a little disappointed...,"i LOVE the first 2 albums (""Verve remixed 1 & 2""). but this one... not as good. it's lacking the essence of the original songs, and some of the tracks are really plain throughout, sounding like ordinary electonica with vocals slapped on. get ""Verve remixed 1 & 2"" first."
3,"""I wouldn't dream of interfering with your monopticons!""","Highly underrated, and deservedly so. It's filled with double entedres, OTT acting and dialogue, and unsual theatrical staging. But, that's why I enjoy it. Four to Doomsday is also a very odd piece if Who, even though it's presentation is totally straight forward. I feel this story helps flesh out Adric and Tegan's relationship. And Adric, annoying as he is, is not bad in this serial, still showing his immaturity and impressionability. The design of the spaceship is done very well, giving a feeling of a lot of space.As said before, this one always seems to get lost in the shuffle. But if you're a non-discriminating Who fan, you might find enjoyment when Tegan can understand the dialect of an Aborigne taken from Earth over 25,000 years ago and believe her draftsman abiltiy, watch silly swordsplay(why is all JNT era swordfighting look like they're rehearsing it?) and Chinese Dragons, then this might be the Who serial for you..."
4,Engineer looking for additional insight on workplace antics,"It's a quick read with nothing but the meat and potatoes as far as the relevant information is concerned. Perfect for most engineers looking for an informational source that helps explain typical scenarios at the workplace that ""do not compute""."
3,Good for a Generic Outlook,"This book is a well-written, generic overview on the engineering field (and many professional careers). I was disapointed mainly because of the musleading tite, that hinted that there would be more technical knowledge, or real life crises that would be discussed and advised on. It was an okay read overall, but skip it if you are looking for actual solutions to common engineering challenges."
1,Crap,This is the worse book I have ever read. What was this girl thinking when she wrote it. Unbelievably stupid.
3,Serving Cart,Delivery was quick. The cart is not as sturdy as I would like it to be. It is also smaller than I'd expected - I should have paid more attention to the measurements. Okay for the price.
4,"Lyrical ,deeply introspective novel","Nair is a consumate writer with a deep understanding of human nature and matters of the heart. Using a traditional dance form from India: ""kathakali"" which depicts traditional ancient tales and characters, Nair weaves them into parallel lives set in modern India. She skilfully uses the ""moods"" the traditional dances depict, such as love, peace, anger etc into the stories of the main characters who struggle with issues of jealousy, fear, love and other desires. Reading this book ,we have the double benefit of a great story and a wonderful learning experience of an art form of which not many in the West have ever heard. I admit, that having seen the dance form as I have, does add more to the enjoyment of the book, but a reader with wider global interests will love this book."
1,Poor quality hole saw.... get a Milwaukee,Inferior to Milwaukee.... spend the extra buck to get a better quality hole saw. I'm suprised that Dewalt would sell such a poor quality product.
3,sturdy hole saw blade,"The blade is sturdy and cuts pretty well. I used it to cut 3/4 plywood. The windows help clear out sawdust and view the start of drilling the hole. The pilot drill is almost the same length as the saw blade in it is a bit difficult to see to align the drill with the mark on the wood. If the saw were not so deep it would be easier to see. The saw teeth should cut a wider swath. I had trouble clearing sawdust out of the hole and the blade rubbed on the hole sides causing burning. The sawdust sticks to the blade when cutting. I had to raise the blade and clear out sawdust a lot. I think it would be difficult to cut deeper holes with these blades, but they did the job for me."
1,waste of money,its a waste of money to buy this product its not at all atractative the way its looks on the net is way different than it is in real and with the money i paid for this i could have bought at least four of the same kind.and it was much smaller than i expected and the vase is also unattractive an hopeless product.i wanted to return this but again i will have to pay for the shipping.
1,ATTENTION !,"This ""On Tibet"" should be renamed to ""About Tibet"". If your purpouse is to enjoy beautiful landscapes of Tibet, its religion, buddhism, rituals, sacred places and so on, you'll make a mistake buying this video. ""On Tibet"" is a 4-hour speeches about Tibet, Mr. Thurman standing in fornt of you like a teacher at school. It is boring and if you don't mind it is less expensive to buy an audio cassete or CD. Attention !"
5,Thurman the Teacher,"You need some background in Buddhism to appreciate this series. I have other films by Robert Thurman and find him captivating. This series is sort of an historical account of Tibetan Buddhism, is not as deep as Thurmans ""Buddhism"" and more centered on why, who and how the Dharma was spread in Tibet."
3,The future is not in this direction,"Not a bad CD, hard to class; probably psychedelic trance, not really Goa. Nothing exciting here though, although a bit insane and some nice samples. A bit like Shamanic Tribes on Acid, etc."
2,dissapointed,I had high expectations for this book but was disappointed. There is a great story here but the author keeps the same laid back tone for being involved in a fight as eating a bagel. If you want an inside look at the police force written in PG or sub PG style then here it is. The book did keep my attention to the end. I kept hoping the author would get or give a shot of adrenaline to his writing.
3,because certain parts,"I would have given this a 4/5 if it was not for those sick moments like for example the woman who stores her fat in a jar and eats some of it every day and also when the went out to eat she threw up on her food and gave date some of it(I AM NOT JOKING). Also how the big dude always ate gross things like mayo straight out of a jar and ketchup & mustard on cerial but there was no milk available,and the trasvetite. Oh yea, also the old woman who just took her teeth right out and put the in her drink. Movie was funny but some of the scenes will gross you OUT!"
3,Funny urban comedy from the direct to video prince of urban comedies Brain Hooks,"The Chatroom once again displays the talents of little known comic Brain Hooks. In this film he plays a guy trying to find love on the net, not knowing it's been under his nose the whole time. The film is funny and proves the point that no one is ever who they say on the net."
2,"Substandard picture, terrible remote","When you only pay $150 for a DVR, you get what you pay for. The picture is full of blocky artifacts even at the high quality settings. I can't imagine what the picture looks like at the lower quality settings. The picture on my old VCR looks better than this. The recording A/D processor is only 10 bit/27 Mhz. That explains the low picture quality. The remote is a joke. It has buttons for your TV, but they only work if your TV is a Philips. I gave this 2 stars because it will play Divx discs. But the D/A video processor is only 10 bit 54 Mhz, so don't expect a great picture. Looks like Philips has turned into a ""junk brand"" manufacturer. Also, FYI this thing is made in China. I took it back for a refund."
1,Full of Bugs,"I purchased this unit with great expectations, the picture quality was great but every 30 or so seconds the sound would drop out for a half a second on any disc I was watching. I called Philips tech support... they are clueless. I finally found a DVD recorder forum that described the exact problem I was experiencing. Buried deep on the Philips website is a series of firmware upgrades that was supposed to fix the problem with sound dropping out, my unit would get halfway through the upgrade process and freeze up. frustrated I took it back to Best Buy and purchased a Samsung, that unit is rock solid."
3,50/50 Results,"Received two of these free in a special product promotion from a local store. One of them was used once and then it never worked again. When you turn it on it displays the message 'Startup' and never gets beyond that. The other unit has worked well for a year now but has never been used for recording so I don't know what the results of that would be. The TV tuner feature has also never been used. The DVD picture quality, connected via HDMI to a 1080p TV, seems fine."
2,Can't copy the finalized disc,"I have the 3400, at first I was happy because the unit could burn dvd- and dvd+ but I've since had a few issues that are annoying. I purchased the unit to backup family vhs tapes and it worked fine, but the remote is poorly designed as is the editing functions, I no longer rename or add chapters because of the hassle.The end product is decent but the resulting disc is not copyable! I've tried every dvd copy program (Nero, DVDClone, FabDVD, et al; ad nauseum) and none of them recognize the disc as a compliant format. This becomes a problem when I need multiple copies for family members. My only recourse is to re-encode the vob files in an authoring program which takes 4 hours. I may still return this unit for a different manufacturers product."
2,Better as a Short Story,"Krauser has a fun idea that worked well as a short story, but grows old as a novel. The prose includes some brilliant sections of great pathos and humor, but also becomes tedious at times--almost as if the author has become as fascinated with his own words as the protagonist has with his fruit. (This is a nice effect at first, but like a lot of experimental writing, it begins to wear thin before too long.) Still, before it tests the patience, the book is enjoyable. I look forward to Krauser's next work."
1,I regret finishing this book almost as much as I do beginning it,"LK is a fierce fool who raises questions he can't answer and renders far too few saying far too much. His minimalism is baroque to the point of nausea, his theatrical intensity is no mask for his slithery koaned excruciastics, he bores me to tears for which I disdain him, they are cheaply wrought and not worth my time. This book is the saddest harlequin ever to sully my shelf. If I had paid for it, I would weep. Thank the Good Lord Above I did NOT. Everything should be for free, especially this."
4,Great!,"If you enjoy Puerto Rico, buy the expansion pack. It allows for more game variety. In fact, if you're spending the money on Puerto Rico in the first place, I think you should just get the expansion to go with it. It's an exceptional value.Note: The expansion does not change the number of players who can play, just the options throughout the game."
5,Looking for the next Microsoft?,I have a feeling that the investors who discover the next Microsoft will owe thanks to great research advice presented in the Guide for Penny Stock Investing.
5,Helping me make money,"I finished reading the book and I can tell you two things for sure. One I was surprised when I realized that the author is only 23 years old! My next surprise was that a 23 year old could write a book that would help me make so much money. I guess what they say is true, in the new economy anyone can make money regardless of their age and experience. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about making money in penny stocks."
4,Could have used some charts,Straight to the point. The author writes as if he is having a conversation with you which makes the guide easy to understand. It could have used some charts but the lack of charts is compensated by the accurate and practical info provided. I feel confident that I now have a real opportunity to make money with penny stocks.
4,You will never make money in penny stocks unless,"You will never make money in penny stocks unless you have a clear business plan to follow. I have seen so many investors try to invest in penny stocks only to see their investments evaporate. The only way to make money in penny stocks is by having a plan that is based on reality. The author, Donny Lowy, provides a clear plan of action that is based on his personal trading experience. I have used it now for a few months and I can see what a difference it makes. This book is definitely for you if you want to make money investing in penny stocks."
1,THIS IS A SCAM OF A BOOK,"This book is a total scam. [...] literally every single page there are misspellings. It is so poorly organized that you cannot follow a single concept the guy is writing. On top of that, there are no strategies offered and his advice is outright nonsensical. This book is 100% a scam and those who wrote it should feel ashamed of the swindle they are trying to pull. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."
5,One of the best books on Penny Stock,"This is one of the best books on penny stock investing, and it has helped me learn a lot about investing in penny stocks. Mr. Lowy has done a great job with his clear, concise writing, and his ideas are top-notch. I loved the strategy section at the end of the book, but the clear positives about the book are when he would demonstrate using real experiences that have happened to him. I definately believe that everyone should own this book especially if you're investing in penny stocks, or are looking to investing in penny stocks."
1,The WORST edited book I've ever read!!!,"This is the second time I've written a review -- maybe my first one was so bad they wouldn't they didn't want anyone to see it.This book has some good ideas, but frankly I have NEVER seen some many spelling & gramatical errors in one book. These errors will frustrate you so much that you won't be able to concentrate on the content of the book.Look somewhere else for information on penny stock investing -- I am."
2,3 whole years of experience?,"I am sorry, but I just do not see how you can justify 3 years of experience as enough. Heck, over the past 3 years, just about anyone with an online stock account could have made 500% with the way the market was performing."
1,VERY BAD BOOK,"Wow...this was a BAD one! First of all, the book is out of date. The markets have completely changed since this book was written. Second, the grammar and spelling are TERRIBLE! There is no way that an editor even looked at this book. Ever heard of a spell-checker? Apparently, this is par for the course for Mr. Lowy. Read the reviews for his other books and you will find the same thing with each one. Poor grammar. Poor spelling. Nothing original. Save your money."
3,It keeps with its name.,"The Complete AR-15/M16 Sourcebook: What Every Shooter Needs to Know keeps with its title. Well, somewhat. The book is a very detailed SOURCEBOOK. Do not buy this book to find out what you can do to accessorize your rifle. This book goes into detail about the origins of the AR-15/M16 beginning with the early years and including some photos and text on early models and models that did not make it. The book talks about some of the larger companies that make the AR-15/M16, and has pictures of most of the variants by company. It is a worthwhile read if you desire to learn about the history of the rifle, but is by no means what every reader needs to know."
3,A Good Historical Reference for AR15 Rifles But Needs More Recent Updates on the Technical Sections (Second Half),"For new owners of the AR15 rifle who are looking for a good reference book for the historical evolution of the rifle and basic understanding of the parts and terminology, this is a good starting point. However, If you want to get the necessary detail to actually work on the rifle, I would recommend going to AR15.com to the get more current tips and guidance. This book was last revised in 2001 and a lot had changed since, including the expiration of the ban on assult rifles in 2004. It is enjoyable reading."
3,complete AR15/M16 SourceBook,"The book is a pretty good book about ARs. I had seen an older edition of the book and since that time really wanted a copy of it. I was elated to find this newer version, thinking it might have later and updated material. I was not very happy when I found some of the earlier pictures and material had been left out. The earlier versions are indeed a lot better than this edition. I was sorry I bought the book."
3,Good book on the AR-15/M-16 but needs an update.,"I have owned this book for a few years. I had found it for cheap at a second hand book store. Like most Duncan Long books, it is good information, but the books tend to be overpriced. Easier to find an electronic copy somewhere or find it cheap as a cast off book for less money at a second hand store. Nice pictures and line drawings, but all in black and white. Some sources are now out of date or no longer selling gun parts. Good book to have on hand if you build or repair this style of gun."
3,Sparks will fly,"This would probably be a perfect tool for the hobbyist or weekend entusiast. With professional use you can expect it to last half as long as tools which cost twice as much, which seems fair. Its light weight will be appreciated when doing grinding in awkward or overhead areas. I rated it three stars because of the funny spindle size; in my area everyone stocks 5/8-11 and other sizes are hard to find. Don't expect greatness, but Makita is still a reputable company."
1,Died after less than 20 hours ...,"I really can't recommend this product. I had hoped that something that said ""Makita"" on it would be a quality product, but they must have gone downhill since my dad used them (admittedly, this was at least 20-25 years ago.) My primary use for this was/is as a masonry grinder, grinding out old grout and/or cement for re-pointing. The location of the air intake at the front of the machine guarantees that it will suck in a *lot* of dust, and this ultimately led to the demise of the grinder. For metal grinding it might be okay, but not for anything of a silicaceous nature. It was absolutely burned out. I bought a DeWalt today ... Hopefully it will last longer ..."
4,Great tool for smaller hands,"I really like this grinder. I am a professional tilesetter, and it has always worked great for me. It is lighter and smaller in circumference than the Dewalt, and the locking ""on"" switch saves my hand from getting tired. I have found it is very durable, too. The only thing I do not care for is that you have to manually remove the blades; it has no quick change system. I suppose that's my fault for not spending the bucks for that feature, though."
5,This is more than perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, I am a man, and I have used this wondeful product for years. I always get compliments on my hair and the color if it. Yes, my natural hair color is dark blonde, and I'm starting to gray a little. This product covers the gray, and I look GREAT !!!!! And, once again...I always get wonderful compliments !!!!!"
4,Use with Caution,"This product works well, but according to my hairdresser it isn't so great for your hair. Unlike natural lighteners like lemon and vinegar, Sun-In has chemical ingredients that remain in your hair until it grows out. It will continue to lighted each time you go out into the sun. So just make sure you use it sparingly, and don't rush the results. A light spray before you head into the sun will lighten your hair, but if you drench your hair it might wind up much lighter than you initially intended."
4,Lovvvee,"It worked very well, and made my hair pretty light. One problem was I tried to bleach a part of my bangs after I used Sun In so I could put blue in my hair, and it ate away my hair because of the sun in. My hair is pretty damaged now. So if you use it, heres a tip: don't use bleach! Hahah"
4,Great!,"I have medium brown hair and I really wanted to make my hair lighter so I tried sun in. It worked well for me but you need patience to use this prouduct because it takes a couple times through using the prouduct before you see dramatic results. Sun in also makes your hair very dry after so make sure you condition your hair really well. The reason I rated is only four stars is because it makes your hair dry but it works really well. When I went to school after the summer some people thought I got highlights and others thought I just sat in the sun and my hair turned dirty blond. What everyone said I was pleased with and very happy with the results. You may feel a little bit different after using this prouduct, but a good different. So I recommend this prouduct for all those out there that want their hair a little or a lot lighter because this prouduct has great, natural and controllable results! Thanks, Charles' daughter"
3,It okay,Nothing quick or easy or even special.I guess it works best on other hair types.Smells really nice and makes it softer.
4,Good,Great product. Really works. My hair is naturally brown and it boosted the light brown in it tremendously. With only using it a few times after showering and blow drying my hair my hair looked a lot browner. I got many compliments on my hair and many people though I dyed it. The only reason it is receiving four starts instead of five is because it is bad four hair. It dries it out.
4,"Great, in-depth book",This book is a really great introduction to the functional systems of the brain. It also goes into the results of lesions on the different parts. Although written in 1973 it is still relevant today.
4,Beautiful on the inside and out.,"A teaching book about how we may be different on the outside but still beautiful, and beautiful on the inside as well. Annie the cow and her farm animal family are different as can be on the outside, but they love each other all the same. I think the book does a good job conveying the message the author is trying to send, and I like the artwork. The animals eyes are big and wide, kind of humanizing them."
2,wrong item,"this seller sent me the worng item, i recieved an almanac instead of teh book. however i am rating it at all because my money was refunded to me when i made a complain. fair enuf"
5,For people who love real hip-hop or music in general,"I have nothing bad to say about this CD. Every track has so much to offer from the music to the lyrics. Each beat has a nice mix of jazz, blues, and classical music combined with hip-hop beats that bring it all together. On every track the lyrics are so fluid and meaningful there's no way you can't feel this music. I personally love this CD and Typical Cats. If you love music, poetry, hip-hop, and art this CD is for you"
4,"Nice guide, good maps","I recently took a trip to Toronto and used this guide fairly extensively. It was nicely organized, the restaurant reviews, descriptions and things to do were all very helpful. In addition, as a result of using this guide I found some architectural gems in two neighborhoods not normally frequented by tourists and the walks I took around these two locations gave me a better sense of Toronto history and heritage. There are maps throughout the book so I was able to take advantage of Toronto in bite-sized pieces rather than referring back and forth to some master map located inside the covers."
1,confused even more,"I bought this book because I needed answers, not more questions. After reading this book, it is obvious to me that the author has had no experience taking care of an elderly relative. Where are the outcomes of the case studies?. yes, I saw myself in some of these studies, but none of them has a resolution. Researching a book is easy, writing a book is easy, anything is easy compared with actually being a caregiver. I am returning the book and looking for one that was written by someone who actually went through what I'm going through!"
2,poor Quality,"I bought these because a customer already had some and a few of them needed to be replaced. The connectors to the bulbs are poorly designed and after a few times of taking out and putting in the push in type bulbs, the connection becomes very iffy (technical term). When they work, you do get a lot of concentrated light. I would rather spend more money and get a different type of under cabinet lighting."
3,Did not fit my sending unit.,"I bought this to change my sending unit on my 98 gmc k1500. It was way to big, but It does seam to be very high quality."
2,...but you learn about JOHNNY!!!,"this CD doesn't do the job of doing either Frank or John the applause they certainly deserve! the frankie is Sinatra, the johnny is Wallowich. you know frankie, but you probably dont know John. wow!!! what great performer! he was a NYC institution. sang, wrote, coached, perfomed...in clubs & his own call-in cable show. Great!...if you like porter, coward, the greats of cabaret, you loved John. he made you laff! skip this CD. you surely have Sinatra. go get Wallowich. he wrote funny, sad, outragious stuff...even a song named ""A Song About Larry""...me."
2,Not comfortable,I thought these would work but they just were too narrow for my foot and didn't match up to the quality of the Acorn slippers
5,Great for winter!,"I had the men's version of these, and found my wife to always ""borrow"" them. I finally bought her a pair for herself, and she loves them! They are warm for the winter time, and also have a durable sole for quick trips outside."
3,good but not the best,I got these slippers for my wife as a gift. They are soft and look nice. They are true to size. She does like them but she likes her old Posturepedic slippers better.Shoes.com delivered them very quickly and delivered exactly as I requested.
4,Toasty!,"These are pretty great. Don't know what I'd change about them, except maybe make them a little more attractive."
1,Dead in the water,"This movie has been in my wish list since I first read glowing reviews in 2004...judging by the single star I gave it...I paid about $3 with shipping and was a total letdown. I'm all about a good atmospheric horror movie, hence the reason I consider Session 9 in my top 3 all-time favorites. There was no shock value, there was nothing to do with anticipation, no suspense...and it was as predictable as watching a kids show. I really wanted to like this movie but......"
3,Could have been better...,"The story line in the movie is good, solid. The sets used were very good. The acting was mediocre, even for a slasher film!But the sound! That was absolutely horrible! It would get very faint and then loud. It kept drifting in and out during the entire movie. When it got loud it got very loud. And when it was faint it was extremely faint.The disc I got was production line so I expected more from it. The price was good for this hard to find movie.Had I known about the sound I would have waited to purchase it."
5,AWESOME,"She'll be a star as soon as her single is out, my Husband and I, saw and heard her live in Nashville with Dierks Bentley opening for George Strait. Her song is AWESOME and so is she. she's an outstanding performer,worth keeping your eye on, she going to go all the way!!!!!"
5,In concert,Saw her perform this song live in concert. It will be a hit as soon as it hits the airwaves!
5,HOLD ON TO YOUR COWBOY HATS!!!!,The song is simply amazing!!!...and so is Michelle! I cannot wait until the video comes out for all the world to see America's next country music superstar!....Shania who????????
4,Comprehensive Overview,"In comparison to other books about specific breeds of dogs, this stands out as an exception. Full of history, care and disease information about Old English Sheepdog. I keep copy on my coffee table. Constantly looking up details as my OES grows through puppyhood."
3,Old English Sheepdogs,"I have not been able to finish re health, but I really like what I have read and recommend this book if you are thinking of getting an OES"
5,great album,"Like every album of J D's I've heard it's great, I really like the songs Dwight sings high lead."
4,WOW...More Than What I Wanted..and Everything I ever Had..,"I was just looking for some gospel on DVD when I ran accross this WOW 2002 DVD... It starts out w/CeCe Winans and gets even better.... 'bout halfway through ... you're lifting your hands in praise with Yolanda Adams...Swaying in the Spirit with Fred Hammonds, Stompin with John P. Kee and dancing with Bishop T.D. Jakes & Richard Smallwood.. Indeed this DVD... was More Than What I wanted and everything i ever had..."
3,It's getting better!,"Definately a big improvement over the WoW Gospel 2001, the 2002 DVD is getting better. However, if these are the best music videos in Christian music, then I dont want to see the second best ones! Also, whoever is leading this 'coalition' needs to work on using the DVD format to it's fullest. Subtitles are missing still, and with Music videos of live events the WoW people could make use of the angle button everyone has! Anyway, its still getting better- hope 2003 brings the glory of god to everyone again!"
5,An interesting British band,"Mermaid Kiss is an English band formed in Kington, Herefordshire in 2000, with influences ranging from contemporary folk music to progressive rock. This was their first album, featuring lead vocalist Evelyn Downing. There is a certain quality in their musical production which makes you want to hear more."
4,Marvellous Adventure,"My husband and I read this book even more quickly than we expected. Cabeza de Vaca tells his adventures with simple clarity. The suffering he and his companions experienced is amazing, as is the kindness and generosity of the indigenous peoples who helped them."
1,6 Artists Paint a Portrait,"I knew this would be a used book but........ The book arrived stained, reeked of mildew and was bent badly. Sad because I took classes with one of the artists and wanted a reminder of Ann Toulmin-Rothe. Ann has died and I enjoyed her art classes at the Silvermine School in Norwalk, CT. Janice"
5,Love them!,"I panic every time I misplace them! But some how... they keep finding their way back to me. I got them in 2006 for a trip to Mexico.I love the fit, color and anti glare.If I could give the 10 stars I would!!"
5,Uno de los mejores 5 discos de los 90's,"Según mi opinión este disco Counterparts de Rush es uno de los mejores discos de los 90's, se identifica las distorsiones de guitarras que se imponen a muchos grupos de la onda grunge y una versatilidad del bajista que ojalá tenga pronto la suerte de ver en vivo."
4,Very good album.,"This was the follow-up to Roll the Bones and saw the band get a lot more into electrical guitar and less on the keyboards and synthesizers to back up the sound. Standout tracks include ""Stick it Out"", the instrumental ""Leave that Thing Alone"", and ""Everyday Glory."" Though probably not as popular as Rush's earlier stuff, from the mid to late 80's, this is a solid album all the way through and displays what the band does best, write good songs backed up by nice guitar, bass, excellent drumming and some keyboards."
5,A Newer Rush Masterpiece,"When I started listening to Rush two years ago (only 18, cut me some slack on that one), I started with their early stuff, 2112 (still my favorite), A Farewell to Kings, Fly By Night, etc. Then I progressed (pun intended) to their ""middle"" era, of Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures. I finally picked up Counterparts when the remaster was released, and was surprised to hear such a solid album. I enjoy Signals, but Presto didn't impress me all that much, and neither had Test for Echo. Counterparts, however, is a gem. Nobody's Hero, Between Sun & Moon, Alien Shores, and Double Agent are the standouts for me, but it is truely a sold album. I highly recommend it."
3,Pretty good.,"Counterparts surprised me quite a bit when I first listened to it a few years ago. The album is in a straight-ahead hard rock direction. It's quite a bit different from previous albums. Keyboards aren't used very much. Counterparts isn't bad. The production has a rough and thick sound to it. All of the tunes are listenable, though. The ones that I like the most are ""Stick It Out"" and ""Leave That Thing Alone."" ""Everyday Glory"" is pretty cool, too. The album's musicianship is tight. The songwriting is also good. The photos and pictures in the liner notes are interesting. Counterparts isn't a personal favorite, but it's still worth a listen."
3,Rock Out w/ Rush,"Frankly, I think CP rocks out more than their 70s stuff. It's very sleek & concise. With a few clunkers, Speed of Love & Everyday Glory stand out, it is not perfect. Rush has yet to hit perfect status; although MP is certainly close as hell. CP is fine rock album, but I have always been disappointed that they do not play Cut to the Chase in concert. There are great moments here in Animate, Leave That Thing Alone, and the bridge of Stick It Out. Recommended for the Rush fan & nonfan."
2,"It is Rush, but not like the good old stuff.","A lot of it sounds the same. I love Rush, but I believe they lost their luster around Signals. Everything started sounding the same. The explosiveness and creativity kind of went down the drain. Still would love to see them live, but nothing compares to the stuff they did prior to Moving Pictures."
2,Counterpunch!,"I remember anticipating this album when it came out I had heard ""stick it out"" and was counting the days. Finally THE ALBUM CAME AND!.......it was HORRIBLE!!Basically I figured out in one listen that ""animate"", ""stick it out"", and ""double agent"" were about the only good things this album had to offer and NO I DON'T LIKE ""hero"" that song was awful. I'm giving it two stars because the 3 songs I mentioned were so good that it saves this poor album from being a 1 star.2 outta 5!"
2,Rush's corniest album ever.,"I'm a huge Rush fan- they're easily one of my all time favorites- but this record is downright embarrasing to listen to. All the riffs and hooks are great, but the lyrics- holy crap! The cheesiest stuff you'll ever hear. From the opening track, we get this line: ""My counterpart, my foolish heart. Man must learn to rule his tender part"". Wow. It's unintentionally funny- your buddies will get a good laugh out of it. ""Between Sun & Moon"" and ""Leave that thing alone"" are the best tracks, by far. The second one is another great instrumental, and thankfully, no vocals on this one. Get ANY other Rush record before this one - there are about 30 of them, I think. Test for Echo is much better."
2,Unbeliavable,"Unbeliavable that a reviewer below could think that the song ""NOBODY'S HERO"" may have been written for the heroes of September 11th,2001, when this album was released in 1993... Incredible...As for COUNTERPARTS, it's plain dumb, as most of Rush's work of the nineties. The production is utterly commecial, no wonder they brought in producer Peter Collins to do it... A shame.I really do not like this album, and put it in the same league of the dreadful HOLD YOUR FIRE, in the ""fireless"" category."
1,SO BAD...,"RUSH reached the boittom here, mixed in absurd quantities of digital sound and overproduction by one of the masters in destroyuing the souls of bands, producer peter Collins (he did Queensryche PROMISED LAND and Gary Moore's WILD FRONTIER, both syntesized albuns lacking punch)."
3,"Different direction, miss the keyboards","My favorite albums from Rush are their albums that have a good dose of keyboards. I never have cared much for this album. I realize that they went back to their roots, I just wish they wouldn't have ditched the keyboards like they did. The songs are good for what they are, just not my taste."
5,Revisiting this album is a revelation.,"I always loved this album as it contains some of this band's most powerful and emotional music.Returning to it after several years it is even better that on it's first release and seems to me to be arguably Rush's greatest recording (but really, how can you choose from such an amazing body of work).Personally, I think this is a truly classic Rock album that will be more widely appreciated as years pass. It is spectacularly cohesive and contains lyrics that are both insightful and intricate. Added to this is music that rocks like the proverbial MF.Give this one another few listens. I believe it to be years ahead of it's time."
2,A disappointment,"Two words: Rush Lite.I still saw them twice on that tour, and the songs weren't any better live."
2,Grunge influence through the pores,"What? GEDDY, ALEX, AND NEIL are wearing flannel shirts? The 90's was a dark time for Rush fans. Rush fans do not wear flannel. What were they thinking?????"
1,Rush Sold Out!,"It stinks, why did they go mainstream? Trying country music, what a joke? Geddy needs go to the closet and get his keyboards back out."
5,My Favorite Rush Album!,"For many years 2112 had been my favorite album, but Counterparts is so full of very deep lyrics that most anyone can relate to, and insane guitar, bass, and drums that it took my top spot several years ago. There are songs on this album that make me cry, songs that make me think, and songs that make me get up headbang like I was 16 again! You can't go wrong here."
4,rush's best 90's album,"Now that the 90's are about over, this album stands out as rush's best of the decade."
3,"""Counterparts"" is a good direction for Rush.","Counterparts shows Rush going back to their guitar-bass-drums sound and abandoning keyboards almost entirely. This was a good choice for the band, and many of the songs on ""Counterparts"" rock more than anything the group has done in a decade. The first five songs on Counterparts are flawless, but the second half drags the disc down. Rush was able to polish their new sound and give us a stronger effort with ""Test for Echo,"" their next album."
2,THE WEAKEST RUSH ALBUM EVER !,"I've bought this CD a long time ago and until now I can't feel it right. ""Nobody's Hero"" is a beautiful song, but the others seem all alike to me, over-produced, as if to hide the lack of inspiration of the band for this CD."
2,"""Don't swallow the poison!""","Well, they asked for it. Peter Collins and his glossy production trying to make Rush into something they are not. Fear is not a good enough reason for prog-rockers to turn ""Alternative."" I swear some of the songs here sound like hyped versions of Pearl Jam. I don't mind a change in direction, but an about-face is something else. For such heralded musicians and writers of some of the more intricate songs I have ever heard, it was truly a shame to hear the fairly conventional song-structures, cliched lyrical content, and jagged production. I remember actually liking this album for the first few spins, but after a few more I was beginning to be annoyed. I never listen to this album anymore, while I still return to their earlier albums with confidence. The only really good track here is the instrumental ""Leave That Thing Alone."" That's good advice. They have much better albums than this disappointment. Later."
3,Back to the basics,"Presto and Roll the Bones pared down the wall of synthesizers that Rush was known for in the 80s, but it wasn't until this album that the band finally reverted into the heavy power-trio style. Though the songwriting is in the same straightforward, accessible style of the previous two albums, Alex Lifeson supplies more loud, distortion-laden riffs than he had in years. The music itself is erratic -- it starts out great (""Animate"", ""Cut to the Chase"", ""Nobody's Hero""), descends to an unremarkable mush in the middle and then finishes strong on the last four songs. Fans of the band's early, metal days may really enjoy this back-to-the-basics Rush."
4,No Rush To Judgement,"'Counterparts' was the strongest Rush album since 1985's 'Power Windows', though it's reminiscent of an earlier effort, 1981's 'Moving Pictures'. Peter Collins' gritty, hard and dry production helps to put the bite back into the Canadian 3-piece, giving them a 90s frisson. High points are the cut and thrust of songs like 'Animate' and 'Stick It Out' and, by way of contrast, the sweeping 'Nobody's Hero', which includes a string arrangement. The latter half of the record lacks the drive and focus of the first half, but nevertheless 'Counterparts' is a consistently pleasing listening experience."
4,"Best album since ""Moving Pictures""","""Counterparts"" provides a more hard-rocking sound than its pop-oriented predecessor ""Roll the Bones"". Like all post-""Hold your Fire"" albums, this one suffers a bit from songs that sound too similiar. Neil strives hard for writing lyrics concerning social issues as this is evident on all the band's '90 albums (""Heresy"" from ""Roll the Bones"", ""Nobody's Hero"" from ""Counterparts"" and ""Virtuality"" from ""Test for Echo""), but they are too artificial and forced. Musically this is Rush's best performance for years and there are only two or three songs which leave me cold. All in all, I think this is Rush's most consistent, inspired and enjoyable album since their early '80s work."
4,A Cold Fire,"This Rush album for me marked the continuation of the cooling off of Rush's optimism, and moving toward much more personal ""Why is it like this?"" themes.Also, at some period, during the ""Hold Your Fire"" album the band began writing songs apart- Neil writing the lyrics and taping his drum parts apart from the other two, who work together to write the music.They really like this arrangement, but for me, it is the explanation for the different music. Of course, they have grown as musicians and as people, and I know that with age, people's viewpoints become more conservative. This may have something to do with it as well.Even though I liked Hold Your Fire and Conterparts in places, it lacked a cohesiveness that other Rush albums often had. Maybe it's my own predjudice for 20 minute songs, I don't know...Mainly, though it's a good solid rock album, but lacks the emotion of previous albums, except in places."
4,Helpful Orientation,"With a broad subject like ""Buddhism"", it helps to get information from a variety of sources. The Thurman DVD lectures gave me an understanding of Buddhism that I was unable to get from books. Thurman provided an enthusiasm and transmitted a personal involvement by his tone of voice and mannerisms. These sorts of things aren't easily communicated by books.I agree with many of the complaints others have cited. (I especially enjoyed the ""Thinking of Taking a Class with Thurman?"" review.) Why, for example, was there no onscreen text? It appears that not much effort went into producing the video.Nonetheless I'm grateful for the warmth of Thurman's presentation and for the new perspective that I gained from viewing the lecture - a perspective that I had missed in my readings."
5,blistering and loud,"Tom Jenkinson throws us a curve ball with the Chaos AD alias. Don't expect Squarepusher here... there's hardly a jazz hint in sight. This is furious electro jamming, lots of grindy 303 lines, hammering Jenkinson drum programming, and even a cheeky vocal track. It's easily one of the best things he's ever put on tape, giving Big Loada a run for its money sheerly based on ""Buzz Caner""'s ferocity."
3,Squarepeg,"This release on Rephlex remains one of Jenkinson's better releases - reminding me of a cross between ""Feed Me Weird Things""s crunchier acidic moments and Aphex Twin's Caustic Window or Universal Indicator releases - none of the indulgent jazz noodling that blights his worst releases. Straight down the line experimental hardcore acidic techno."
4,Good but....,This is a good durable rope swing but we did not realize how short the rope was! We have a tall swing set/tree house and the rope is way too short! We are going to have to rig up something in order for our boys to be able to use it!
3,Don't miss this one,"Cool girls, cool locations, cool music...my only complaint is that the DVD isn't longer in length. I like the almost ""real life"" feeling to the whole trip. Beautiful erotica, classic and sophisticated. Sophie Evans had me transfixed the first time I saw her in Penthouse Private, and it was such a turn on to hear her speak. I'm a sucker for a foreign accent. I hope Penthouse will keep making shows like this one. Maybe they can come to my city next?!!"
2,Where's the Pink?,"Q - Why do I buy a DVD with the Penthouse name on it?A - To see beautiful women posing in explicit Penthouse style.Too bad that doesn't really happen once in this video. If seeing a naked woman walk down the street or pump gas excites you, fine, I suppose it's an interesting concept on some level. But seeing as it's a Penthouse video, they should have put a warning label on it for me ... and I could have spent my [money] on one of Penthouse's ""Eurogirl"" titles or one of those new softcore movies like ""A Model Solution""... I hope you include my review, to serve as a warning to those who buy Penthouse videos and expect to find the kind of posing and explicitness that can be found in the majority of their productions... you won't find it in this one."
1,Why make Penthouse boring?,"My boyfriend loves Penthouse so of course we had to see this movie. It is very average. The women are naked in public and the reactions look very rehearsed. There is no mood or eroticism here. The film is very poorly scored and [I think] the sound engineer must be tone deaf. ... Hopefully, the next Penthouse movie will be better directed. ..."
5,Great feeling,This is a great product - feels invigorating and smells wonderful. Leaves hands smooth and mosturized without being greasy like a hand cream.
2,Poor Design,"I don't like this case. It will not except the iPaq with an expansion pack. Even with just the iPaq and no expansion card or extra stylus, the size is still larger than my Palm VII in it's case. This is odd considering the iPaq itself is smaller than my Palm. Try the iSuit (my personal favorite) or the Franklin Covey. Also very nice."
2,OK Product,"This product is OK to carry just your handdeld PC. The protection for the screen is adequate. A few low points: a) No space for the expansion jacket b) No space for memory cards etc. This is just an Ok case,not great, being not bulky is its major appeal.There is a lot of room for improvement"
2,Get the Incase case instead,This style pack/case looks cheesy and does not really protect the machine. The Incase large case works much better and costs less. The only functional purpose of this case is to allow you your machine to get banged around and scuffed up so that you can see if Compaq will honor the extended warranty you purchased. The IPAQ is terrific (5 stars); this case is a real loser.
2,"No hay caso, no entra","no se puede usar ninguna chaqueta de expansión en este ""case"", la ipaq viaja desnuda sin protección de fieltro para la pantalla.=("
5,Great way to get in shape!,"This book has really helped me. My mind is filled with 10,000 baby-related thoughts, so my favorite thing is that it gives very specific instructions for each week. That's exactly what I need right now."
4,Poetry for the rest of us,"Poetry has such a tiny audience because so much of it appeals to a ""spiritual"" element in our makeup. Most poets quickly starve of oxygen in this air-fairy atmosphere. Lieberman's poems, while maintaining a solid core touching on the puzzling essences of mankind, is immediately graspable by those of us who admire descriptions of the human condition, but prefer them in the vernacular of everyday experiences. A fascinating read, particularly for the non-poets, i.e., most of us."
5,"Witty, Wicked, Weird, and Wonderful","This move is a trip. One I am sure some people will hate - but hey, it takes all kinds. Parker Posey's performance is just incredible. An unstable Jackie O' wannabe, her mood swings,rapid-fire one liners, and attitude make this film the winner it is.Bujold as the matriarch shows a droll comic side that I have never seen in her before and it is perfect with the dialogue she has. ""Talk? Why would we want to do that, it only leads to trouble."" A scene where she is trying to ship Tori Spelling off in a cab is hysterical.Tori Spelling does a good job as the naive Donut Queen who has no clue what she just walked into. I mean the poor girl grew up eating pancakes. Even Freddie Prinze Jr. does not do badly.Yeah the plot is sick: incest, assasinations, mental instability, jealousy and denial. But mixed up with this cast it is very, very funny. Strange and wonderful if you are the dark humor type."
4,Stunning,"I think the best word to describe me after watching this movie was 'stunned.' I liked it - in a strange way. The acting is phenomenal. The dialogue is superb. The story line is interesting, in a curious sort of way. Even Tori Spelling was good.The movie is set at the home of a family in Washington D.C. Right away you can tell there is strangeness in the family and it is not too long before you realize, for some members it is more than strangeness!Be sure to pay attention because there are a lot of great lines in this movie and the dialogue can move rather quickly. There are some hidden meanings and clues to some secrets that you will want to watch out for!This movie is worth watching, especially if you like quirky dark comedies."
3,Incestuous comedy,"It had some similarities to Sam Sheperd's ""Buries Child"" but with incest, insanity, and JFK! The insane plot was enough to get me to watch and enjoy this cute distraction of a movie. Tori Spelling looked especially ditzy, but I like her that way."
5,"Excellent, original, freakin' weird!","This film is absolutely wonderful! The dialog is outstanding, and the one-liners are plentiful enough to let you watch the movie over and over and still laugh. Each person cast to play each character is perfect for the part (and yes, that includes Tori Spelling (she plays a bit of an air-headed naive girl)). Each performance is great. The movie just doesn't stop getting more and more weird even up to its strange and unexpected ending. Absolutely fabulous. And don't listen to the people who gave it a low rating, Look at how many more great ratings this movie has, and then realize that the people who didn't like it just aren't ready for this type of great cinema, and can always look back at Party Girl for regular indie comedy."
2,oh come on!,"Movies like this make indies look bad. If Parker Posey wasn't a pretty lady I would have never finished this film.Why would anyone want to see Tori Spelling and Freddie Pronze Jr. anyway? Despite some amusing dialogue and a few cool looking scenes, I regretted seeing this movie. It doesn't leave you with a worthwile feeling."
1,Awful Arthouse Trash,"This movie encapsulates everything wrong with ""edgy"" theatre. It has no plot, no characterization, and no talented actors. Whoever wrote this movie really did not incorporate anything that would interest a viewer looking for a well-told story. There is not one redeeming quality about this movie.Sure, the incest thing is edgy, but it is nothing more advanced than etchings in a 8th grader's notebook. How about the Kennedy assassination? Pretty edgy, huh? Well, it would have worked if I had cared about a single character. Unfortunately, every character is extremely one-dimensional and the acting reflects that perfectly. Also, the nuances about the timing of the assassination and the death of the father would have worked if I HAD CARED. But the director lost me at the first forty minutes.This movie is terrible in so many ways. Its plot is flat and the ""twist"" at the end only further serves to show what an insipid piece of junk this movie really is."
2,a shame that the assets here do not a success make,"while i lovvvves all things jackie and parker, the latter was nonetheless more stylin' & fun to watch in clockwatchers, henry fool, guffman etc. eternababe bujold (as her mother) was the Real gem in this, clad in forbidding, chic jessica mcclintock waspiness. and let's not forget to hail rolfe kent's fantastic score (i wish it had been Released! :( ), whose heady main theme recalls jerry goldsmith's ilia theme from the first star trek movie :) but like i sez, this thing don't quite work :( vt"
3,DISTURBED,"Parker Posey has built a career on playing quirky and disturbed characters-even in such mainstream films as You've Got Mail and Scream 3. This picture is definitely one of the more disturbed roles. Adapted from a stage play about an incestuous relationship between a twin brother and sister and the circumstances leading up to the twin brother's death. Posey is her neurotic self as the mentally unstable Jackie O, whose unnatural love for her brother sends her over the edge of sanity. When her brother returns home to Washington, D.C. for Thanksgiving with his new fiancée (Tori Spelling) Jackie O sends their younger brother (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) to seduce her so she can have the twin brother all to herself. Although the film is interesting in its subject matter and boasts excellent performances, it is a bit stilted because it is very obviously a stage play."
3,Dark Comedy at its. . . almost best,"The House of Yes is not for the average movie go-er (such as people who prefer, say, summer blockbusters to indie films), but for those who appreciate (and can sit through) a film peppered with quick banter, taboo insinuations (i.e. incest), and comedic satire. I enjoyed Parker Posey's portrayl of a mentally-unbalanced woman who impersonates Jackie O. that cannot escape the feelings of oneness and amorous love for her twin brother. It is a smart, sassy look at dysfunction, but dysfunction from a surrealist point of view. Tori Spelling's acting is terrible, as I wanted Jackie O. to kill her and be done with it all. Yes, there isn't enough underlying ""tension"" between the characters and what's at stake is marginal at best, but for 85 minutes, the dialog and interesting story line will set you spinning."
4,Must Have for Parker Posey fan,I'm a huge fan of Parker Posey and she doesn't disappoint in this movie. It's quirky. Her character is totally obsessed with Jackie Kennedy Onassis. Everyone in her family is just a little bit weird. Enjoyable movie.
4,Parker Posey is awesome!,"This was a great movie because of Parker Posey's performance. She is unbelievable as Jackie-O, and even looks like her, which makes things a bit...unsettling. The movie is slightly disturbing, but the dialogue is great, the acting is great, and even Tori Spelling is tolerable. (Who would have thought?) This definitely isn't a movie for everyone, because as a lot of people have posted here, there is incest and a play on the JFK assassination, but none of that bothered me."
5,Wow! Great Flick,"This movie is really good. Parker Posey once again shows us the indie-actin' ability that's made her one of the most under appreciated actresses in the business. Great tension in the acting, and even Tori Spelling puts in a respectable performance."
4,Good track,"I listened to the track and it's got some flava. I first saw the movie at Blockbuster, then watched it on cable. Good movie with a bumping cast. Pam Grier was way cool. The soundtrack's has a variety of things, some with Snoop, some with other artists from the east coast. I'd get just because of some of the songs that fly."
5,Perfect!!!!,"This bag is perfect. It's roomy; it's hip; it's just the right size. I was worried it would be too big, but it's just what I had hoped for. Also, it can be worn as a backpack-- too cool. I really love this bag and would strongly recommend it to anyone because it doesn't look like a dowdy diaper bag; it is made of beautiful fabric and could be used as a purse or for travel. Hooray! What an ideal shower gift!"
5,Not the usual diaper bag,"I just got this bag the other day and I absolutley love it! It's the perfect size and I really like the print. It's not the ordinary cartoony bag that you see a lot of. It's stylish and very usable. Plus, mine got here in just a couple of days. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
5,Magnificent Mexican Music,"An excellent choice of Mexican classics which illustrates the best of a number of artists, especially Francisco 'Charro' Avitia & Jorge Negrete (2 songs each). Just don't expect all the tracks to be related to the revolution."
5,Just get this for drinks,"I have been through a bunch of drinks. This is the best on the market right now. Taste is not overwhleming, which I like, and it does not spike me at all.After mixing the drink it will spoil after a few hours so I keep dry powder with me to mix more on the bike. it spoils because it does not use artificial ingredients. I want something that is going ino my body to be an organic material, which means it will spoil at some point."
1,AWFUL TASTE,"I'm so mad I wasted money on this crap, it tastes so awful I didn't even finish one packet (and I tried it with water, then milk thinking milk might help the taste). The best I can think of to describe it, is like a bland chalky taste.. don't waste your money."
4,I will be using this for a while,"I like this product. I have used it on a number of workouts over 2.5 hours including a 7 hour century ride. I wouldn't call it ""delicious"", but I can drink it for an extended period of time and tolerate it all the way through. I have had no stomach problems using it. My energy level seems very even throughout the workouts, and even afterwards I don't seem to be so wiped out. I will be using Perpetuem for a while and will be looking at getting some Heed for my workouts shorter than 2 hours."
4,Nice Mellow Taste,I think it does a good job of giving me good power on long bike rides. I really like the suble flavor. I found that mixing it into a gel works well and it is the best tasting gel I have tried. The flavor in drink form has a hint of milkiness to it which is fine in cool weather. I am not sure how that will work on a hot day. I may go with gel form in a flask and water in my bottles.
2,Made me nauseous,My first time using it was on a 100km ride. I found that the first bottle was difficult to get down and it was just under two scoops in a 0.7L water bottle. Afterward I felt a little bloated and switched to water for the next bottle. The second - freshly mixed - bottle left me feeling on the edge of vomiting after every sip. I spent the rest of the ride balancing nausea against glycogen depletion.I might try it again just to see if it's an adaptation or heat (it was 32C and humid) problem...but I doubt it. This stuff didn't sit right and it doesn't help that the orange vanilla flavour tastes revolting in warm water.
4,needs Cordialatron,"good cd but where is Cordialatron, and why do i have to get it on the import? What is the point of leaving off 2 songs?if you want all the caustic window songs you'll be missing:from Joyrex J4: 1)popcorn 2)AFX 114 (AFX11) 3) CORDIALATRON (awesome track)from Joyrex J5 1) R2D2get the import......"
2,Little Richard,"Caustic Window is Richards worst release. This cd lacks Richards trademark ability to make emotionally charged, inspirational electronic music. Caustic Window comes off sounding more like an uncoordinated twelve year old playing with his new computer, while listening to the chemical brothers. Poor, dissapointing stuff from an incredible artist.YECH!"
4,"Stylish, athmospheric and suspenseful",This early giallo is high on style and athmosphere and one can easily see how Bava influenced Dario Argento. I myself am much more of an Argento fan then Bava but this little thriller is actually one of Bava's better outings.The story is good and keeps you guessing until the very end and the finale is quite suspenseful.
4,"Fun, lighter than usual, Hitchockian thriller from Bava","Bava pays explicit homage to Hitchcock in this fun, mostly light heartedblack and white mystery.An American girl vacationing in Rome witnesses what might be a murder(or is it her overactive imagination, spurred on by her love of cheap mysterynovels?). And before you know it, she's the possible target of a serial killer.The black and white photography is beautiful, but Bava tones his style downjust a bit, and it works; the photography compliments the story, without swamping it,.There are weak spots, like an annoying voice over that insists on explaining what theimages are making very clear by themselves, and performances that are uneven(especially in supporting roles). But, the bottom line is, if it wasn't in Italian, onecould even believe this was a Hitchcock film, which is a pretty high compliment..."
3,SO-SO GIALLO THRILLER.....,"This is not a horror film even though it was once shown in America as ""The Evil Eye"". Instead, it's a very tame little mystery with Bava's giallo atmosphere and little else. An ""American"" girl (Italian actress Leticia Roman) comes to Rome to visit an old family friend who up and dies on her. She then witnesses a murder but there's no body to back her up to the police. So she starts her own investigation ala Nancy Drew style. A bland John Saxon plays a doctor who believes her and provides clues to the mystery. Lots of creepy set-ups but no action keep this one from being as good as it could have been. Not bad as long as you don't expect too much but it was way too dull for me."
1,"""Don't Bother""","I bought this for my 3 year old son. He and I both were very disappointed in it. The hostess is not necessary, her dress is inappropriate, and the technical terms used by the firefighters were too much for a 3 year old to comprehend. 15 minutes of ""Miss Kelly"" is 15 minutes too much. The other 15 minutes is one long commercial on other videos the company sells. This one will sit on the shelf and gather dust. Don't Bother!!! There goes a Fire Truck with Firefighter Dave is much more entertaining."
5,Steal deal at this price,This is very reasonable priced and after all its Sony. SO you can be rest assured.
4,Pretty good tapes,"I've tried these tapes on our older Sony non-HD camera and they worked pretty well.The video would seem slightly grainy and I wondered if it was the lighting, the tape, the camera, etc. etc.I recently got an HD camera and the picture is sooo much better when recording to the very same tapes.It seems like the video isn't as crisp and clear as it could be. I'd love to try the upgraded version of these to see how they compare. For regular recording, they've worked just fine."
4,Good tapes,"I have used these tapes for years now. My Camera is 10 years old, and I have never had a problem with these tapes."
3,"""Premium"" means ""average"" in non-Sony speak","Don't be fooled, ""premium"" means ""average consumer grade"" in non-Sony speak. But that being said, it's a perfectly fine tape for taping your kids at the local park or a ball game.The main difference is that consumer tape isn't designed for archival storage, so you may experience more drop-outs or tape delaminating as it gets older."
1,Don't buy this item,"Search for the following for the EXACT same item for less. ""Sony DVM-60 PR/5 Premium Minidv "". Purchased both and they are identical. Called Customer Service and they wouldn't fix the price. Photo is not what is shipped. The tapes are packaged in a blue wrapper."
5,Great Deal!!!,"These are your standard miniDV tapes made by sony. By ordering them online and getting enough to get the super saver shipping, I saved a ton of money as opposed to buying them in the store. A great buy!!!"
5,Good tapes,Used the mini DV tapes to video a youth leadership seminar. The tapes are of high quality and last a long time.
3,Buy more if you have the chance.,"These are fine tapes, and seem to have a good shelf life. I haven't had one mess up my camcorder or to jam in my winder, so no complaints. Do purchase more as you'll use them!"
4,Nothing to compare them to,I just got these cassettes with my Canon Minidv. The few seconds that I have taped seem to be very good. If I had it to do again I would pay closer attention to the stores shipping and handleing cost.
5,Why buy anything else ?,These tapes are inexpensive and fine for HDV recording. Supposedly the higher grade HDV tapes will have no drops compared to DV tapes but I haven't had problems with these at all. I heard other brands are problematic though. Buy with confidence
3,Sony DVC-60 PR/5,Difficulty taking wrapping off. Other that that this is a good product. The price may be a little high.
3,sony mini dvvalue package,i used these tapes on vacationa nd they taped and downloaded well. I was defective and dropped frames The quality of video was good all around
1,Wrong Tapes,I ordered the wrong tapes and never noticed until I opened to put in the camera. Will never use these.
1,"Wrong product, unlcear product descriptiom","Never owning the type camera as I was given as a gift, the product I order appeared to be the type of tape for my camera. When I received it, it was the wrong type of tape. Company had no policy for exchanges nor a phone number someone would answer."
1,IT IS A TRAP!,The image show the blue ones but when i bought they through Recording Store they send me the yellow ones. They are not the same. The blue ones are better and they have a recubriment over the film that makes it have a better image than the yellow ones. Another trap-trick by amazon to catch buyers!
5,DVC tapes,"From my limited experience with DVC, these tapes seem to perform excellent. The price cannot be beat. I may buy a larger pack next time, we burn tapes quick with the new baby!"
5,Sony tapes last longer,"I've tried JVC,Maxwell,Panasonic and no tapes gets close to Sony, no drop frames etc. and its reliability last longer than the rest."
3,BAIT AND SWITCH,"BAIT AND SWITCH! Ordered and paid for, SONY PREMIUM miniDV Cassetts and got the STANDARD IN IT'S PLACE......You guy's are rapidly moving down the wrong road for success. AT LEAST YOU SENT SONY! Boy thats TWICE ONE OF AMAZON'S PARTNERS PULLED THIS CRAPOLA!!! BUYERS IN NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA YOU DO HAVE A WAY TO RECOVER>>>>>"
5,Great value,"I purchased these for use in my Sony Camcorder, as I prefer to use products sugggested by the manufacturer. I normally copy all my videos to a DVD and erase these tapes with a bulk eraser. I have used the same tape several times with no loss of video quality."
4,Sony MiniDVV,Great product. Works best with my Sony camera - other cassettes cause problems with the camera.
5,Classic Westcoast Gangsta Rap,"This CD really fits into the mid 90's classics. My favorite track on this CD is ""foe life"" followed by ""H-o-e-k"". ""Foe life"" brings back the memories back at parties. Also I like the mack 10 album ""Based on a true story"". The album ""The recipe"" is not as good as the first 2."
2,True to his lyrics,"A friend was once volunteering at a toy drive in Los Angeles for poor and needy families. Mack 10 rolls up with a couple of his 'peeps' and says, ""Yo, my homeboys paid fo' this."" He and his 'peeps' proceeded to take armfuls of toys and walked off. Other volunteers didn't know what to do and weren't sure if what he said was true, so they just watched it happen.Mack 10 raps ghetto, presents himself as ghetto, and he essentially steals toys from kids. Way to go, you hardcore dirty POS. You are a true inspiration for all who want to amount to nothing in life. Go smoke your crack and die somewhere. The world is better off without people like Mack Douche."
5,Embrace your divine feminine!,"This is a great CD for those times (and especially times of the month) when you are feeling great stress and fatigue. The pace is slow and serene. Ateeka takes you s-l-o-w-l-y through a series of seated circular movements leading into stretches mostly focused on the hip, pelvic and lower back areas. I felt blissfully relaxed and refreshed. The music, as always with Ateeka's productions, is unique and fresh, no canned native American flutes here! The music seems Asian inspired with a wind chime effect overlaid. Throughout, Ateeka affirms the divine feminine within all of us, urging us to accept the rhythms of our nature and our connections to Mother Earth. The CD ends with a 10 minute relaxation. Ateeka's voice is so soothing and serene, there will be no stress left after you finish this CD."
5,A Fantastic Sneak Peek...,"At what went on behind the scenes of M*A*S*H, particularly during the final week or so of filming. I found this book at the Boston Public Library and, as it was in the reserved books section, read it in less than an hour. And I'm glad I did--I learned more about both M*A*S*H and the show's actors than I could have without interviewing them myself. Arlene Alda did a superb job with the photography, and Alan Alda's commentary is not only insightful, but also makes me wish I was old enough then (I was two in 1983) to appreciate the show, and lets me appreciate it--and the hard work of everyone involved--even more now."
5,Greater Than a Nice Day!,"Have a Nice Day is that rare book that is not only popular and easy to read, but one that really says something. I may have thought I knew it all, but this book sure taught me some things it was about time I learned. God bless you, Gary.Gloria Wendroff, www.heavenletters.org"
5,Valley of Death: An Adventure Story to Remember,"Craig's book pulls you into the world of Jack Riley and Moria Clark, full of fast-paced adventure and romance. Valley of Death was a nonstop thrill ride that kept me intrigued with each new twist and turn. Ceaselessly exciting, Craig's novel keeps you turning pages until the finish."
3,Not as indepth as I wanted it.,"This was an ok book. I was really looking for some more alternative therapies for childhood diseases like measles, etc. I sold mine ""Like New""."
1,A poor example of holistic medicine.,"Kathi Kemper, MD, does a poor job of presenting holistic therapies for childhood ailments.There is too much emphasis on conventional care and much of the holistic therapies are discouraged or not even mentioned.For example, in the chapter on ear infections she devotes nearly 3 full pages to medications and even recommends prophylactic antibiotics. In contrast food allergies, which are one of the most common causes of ear infections, are addressed in only 2 1/2 paragraphs...most of which discourages altering a child's diet.It would be more wise to choose a book on this subject whose author's practice is based on complimentary and alternative medicines, such as a chiropractor or naturopath, rather than a medical doctor whose practice is based on drugs and surgery.Marc Tinsley, DC, Chiropractic Physician"
2,I wouldn't do what it says,"This book has great alternatives to medicine. The only unfortunate thing is that it keeps referring you to a medical doctor. I feel that if you're trying to go the holistic way, why ask a doctor. In general, Doctors don't like alternative medicine. That's just my opinion."
5,Great book. Very practical and down to earth suggestions,"The Holistic Pediatrician is what we've all been waiting for. It answers questions about typical childhood problems in a way that is readable, honest, practical and fair to a variety of different kinds of therapies. I took it with me to my pediatrician, and she had a copy on her shelf already! She said she uses it as a reference to therapies she didn't learn in medical school and thinks the advice is very sound"
5,RAY CHARLES SOUL GENIUS,I have bought a couple of Ray Charles compilations this one is by far the best. I love the Duets portion of this set I think Ray is at his best when he has other great artists to play off of.
3,"Worthwhile, though challenging reading","A decent retrospective of over a century of Olympic history. It is not a smooth read, though, and you will need to take frequent breaks to rest your eyes due to the small type. I also noticed several errors in the statistical information in the back of the book, which the author claims was done by a third-party. It was still a worthwhile purchase and does enhance my Olympic library."
4,Great instruction aid,"Great instruction aid to get of someone just learning to play Yugioh. Only draw back is the video is so dated and so are the cards they use. Most decks use ""effect"" monsters now"
5,This really works!,"I tried everything - this is the only product that worked! Easy to apply, quick results and no mess."
2,no help,"I was excited to get this product as I have issues with all toenails on one foot. Have been using over a month and no change in nail growth noted. I will continue to use, but not holding my breath."
2,They just couldn't make me care about Jack Russell.,"With the relaxation of the Comics Code in the 1970s Marvel Comics rushed to establish books featuring vampires, werewolves, swamp monsters, zombies, the Monster of Frankenstein and many other previously forbidden topics. I would recommend all those others I just mentioned but WEREWOLF BY NIGHT might be the ESSENTIAL volume I've enjoyed the least of all I've read (and I've read a lot). The failing is that they simply never made me care about Jack Russell and his supporting cast. There's a nice list of talent who worked on this series including Mike Ploog, Don Perlin, Roy Thomas and even a Spider-Man crossover drawn by Ross Andru."
5,quick and easy,"item was shipped the same day payment was made, even though it was right before christmas and the busiest time of the year"
4,Good unit.,"Use this in our church, for over a year now. Did not ""clean"" the power like I thougt it would. Our facility is really old and I didn't think any unit would get rid of everything. It is nice to have everything plugged into one unit and it turns things off in an orderly fashion, so there is no popping of the amp through the speakers, which is its main strength. Looks and fits in the rack nicely. Would recommend."
4,A very good basic overview,"This book is a very good basic overview of project finance for complete newbies. It covers well the key project risks as well as the contractual framework that surrounds PF.The book does indeed have a minor, insignificant leftish bias but it only appears in the very beginning of the book (and all of Chapter 5) :).The reason why I gave this book four stars instead of five, is because I wish there were specific examples / CF analyses that would help us get a feel for a typical work performed by the financial advisers / banks."
5,excellent encouragement,"This book provides a ""light read"" gem of encouragement for the one with grieving soul and aching heart. --- Was a little flicker of hope after my mom died in a car accident."
4,A book that aids the journey in accepting the loss of a loved one.,This book was given to me when I lost my wife at 58 years of age to heart disease. It helped me in my grief. I have passed it to others and all have been very appreciative of it. It has been placed in the bookstore of a Seattle area church because it was so well received by a grief support group.
5,Grieving the Loss of Someone You Love by Raynond R. Mitsch & Lynn Brookside,"As a social worker and facilitator of GriefShare, I highly recommend this grief book. It is well written and a easy read especially for those who have recently lost a loved one. I will continue to use this book as a great resource.N. Ann Kepler"
5,Definitely recommend this book!,I happened upon this book several years ago after the tragic and unexpected death of my husband. I found this book helpful to read a little each day to help me through the greiving process. It's great because it is full of short readings that address many of the issues and feelings that come up when someone close to us dies - which is sometimes easier to handle than a long book. I now give this book to friends after the loss of a loved one and ask them to pass it on!!!!!
4,Worthwhile,When you are grieving the loss of someone special it is difficult to get into deep reading. The shorter meditations are helpful
5,Helped so much!,"After the death of our beloved youngest son, this book - given to us by a friend - helped us so very much. Now I give it as a gift to others who experience deep grief. God is good in giving us what we need to process and go on living with such sadness."
5,Helped me so much after my husband died.,"A friend sent this book to me after my huband died 14 months ago. I have given it to several others who have lost spouses, a son, a mother. All have been helped by it."
3,It was okay,"This book did help when my father died, but not as much as the other ones I read. I would look for a better book."
5,HARD-HITTING BOOK SCORES A KNOCKOUT PUNCH!,"A simple, user-friendly book written in ordinary language that everyone can understand. Having availed myself of Mr. Gerstl's legal services for over 15 years, it's gratifying to see one of the most brilliant legal minds I've known turn his attention toward CONSUMER PROTECTION.This book can be the besr gift you'll ever give a friend who's facing any kind of dealing with ""the system."""
5,A KNOCKOUT PUNCH OF A BOOK!,"I, for one, happen to think the American legal system is in shambles. I have, myself, written a book condemning what all-too-often passes for ""Justice"" in this country. My book engages high-profile examples and ""large"" issues. It is for consideration by legal scholars.Mr. Gerstl's book, on the other hand, takes on the problems that are not academic, but those we face every day -- divorce, human disputes, medical malpractice cases, auto accidents, probate and the like. While these disputes may mean less on the ""world"" stage, they are far more pressing and urgent for the INDIVIDUALS involved.Gerstl's book is simple yet profound in its implications, meaningful without being pedantic, resourceful without being patronizing. As such, it is a ""must read"" for those at issue within (or without) the ""system."""
2,"Same old, same old","Cixi had to have been a fascinating woman, to rule China for almost 50 years, but all you get with Woo's book is the same old legends of a beautiful, merciless sexual & political predator. This may be intriguing stuff, but it ISN'T TRUE. Most of these stories of murder, incest, etc., come from an old Victorian hack named Backhouse -- who was also a pornographer -- and wrote sensational stuff that would sell. Woo's book recycles most of it, although I have to say that Woo's style (very English-version-of-a-Chinese-fairy-tale) is a lot better than Backhouse's. Go ahead and read it, but do it for entertainment. Don't think you're getting any history out of it at all."
1,Big Deal...,Don't know where the other websites are finding the stellar reviews on this one. As the saying goes....you get what you pay for. It wouldn't be hard to find a better keyboard for the price. Lousy feedback on the keys and the stands are too short. Don't waste your money.
3,It's an average book,"This book is full of mystery, suspense, and even a bit of romance, but somehow, it lacks in something. To tell the truth, the language, characters, and suspense is good, but it just doesn't seem to hold a persons attention...and tends toward dullness. Recommended only if you're out of books to read!"
4,Feels Like The First Time,"Paul is the adolescent male whose hermetical existence--no drugs, no sex, and a lot of philosophical thought on God--leaves him unprepared for the real world. A loner all his life, a little love and tragedy prick his curiosity and leave him hungry for meaning. We start with a kid who has never watched television, never had a kiss, never stepped outside his small Washington state town, and we end with a kid who, through courage and introspection, discovers himself, his desires, and his place in the world. In Paul's narrative we find frank, inquisitive prose that leaves the reader remembering his own simple yet gut-wrenching coming-of-age years. Caleb Powell has written our past as if we were looking at it for the first time. And, like all first times, our stomachs quiver with each page."
4,Literally could not put it down,"Cabel Powell vividly portrays the struggles of an introspective loner, Paul Taylor, who searches for meaning and answers in his journey into early adulthood. It's a refreshing story in that it refuses to follow the typical ""coming of age"" formula. Instead of finding answers, the endearing Taylor will eventually confront his own shortcomings and accept the idea that having all of the answers is less important than appreciating the world as it is. The story is thought provoking and entertaining and it's the only book I've read cover to cover in one sitting."
4,OF GREAT ASSISTANCE,"This book covers all ranges of the paranormal. As a ghost investigator, the Hauntings section was my interest and it was wonderful. Great detail into how to proceed with investigations, fine examples and some great photo's."
1,not even close,This is really a lot of dribble. I read it cover to cover in about an hour and learned literally nothing of use though I am now well informed about some useless phenomenon like fish raining from the sky. The forms included in the back of the book are marginally adequate. You're much better off with another book.
3,Great for beginners,"This book is a little old, but for people who know little about the paranormal it makes for a great starting point especially since it touches on most of the areas of paranormal investigating. I would recomend it. However if you are a fan of paranormal shows and watch a moderate amount of TV you might already know the information, but a hard copy reference is always a good thing. The one thing that it did have over most books that I have read is a good introduction to reporting and records."
1,save your money,"I recieved this book in the mail, took it home, read half of it and was disgusted with it, I tore it in half and threw it away the same day. If you are even slightly interested in the paranormal you probably know way more ""now"" than you'll ever learn by reading this book."
4,Perfect for me,"If you are looking for the newest advances in cell phone technology, then the T-Mobile Razr isn't it. However, it never claimed to be. It's selling point is size which is perfect. The way to view missed alarms or calls without opening the phone is to press the button on the right side of the phone. (Read the manual, maybe?!) My photos are great, and I have printed them before. If you want a bells and whistles phone, you should probably research a little more thoroughly before complaining about features that were never claimed to exist."
3,The Magenta Razr is okayyy,I like this phone alot. I have always owned plain Nokia's and decided to get something that looked cool. This phone has three way calling which comes in handy. You can record a voice record and take pictures of friends for picture calling id. It is magenta (t-mobile). The color does not scratch off at all. I have noticed that sometimes it turns off (weird) when it is about to lose power. The battery charge does seem to be very short. I thought it was wierd that T-mobile offered to sell me an extra battery right away - it was one of the first optional accessories.
4,Different pinks with different carriers,"I recently got this phone and love it. T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself. For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is. The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown. I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades."
3,"Pretty in Pink, but not much else","I have owned a pink RazR for 5 months now and everyday i seem to like it less and less. Like someone else said, the front screen is used basically for the time. Also it is the hardest thing to keep clean. The outside and inside screens get very dirty looking, no matter how many times you wipe them off. It is also very hard to hear on this phone. Im not sure why, maybe its just mine. I also noticed that in the center of my inside screen there is like a water bubble, you can still see the picture, but it you hold it a certain way its very noticable.All in all, I think they can do better. 3 stars is it."
2,Too much hype!,"I originally owned a Sidekick II and that phone was not all it was cracked up to be so I heard about the RAZR phone and went directly to T-mobile and bought one...the pink one. I thought the Sidekick was bad, this one was worse! It gets hot as soon as you put it up to your ear, and it may be thin but it's big once you open it. I charged the phone for 24hrs before I used it, the phone never held a charge all day. AND when I would flip the phone open to use it, it would just shut off. Now maybe mine was a defective phone, but I returned it 12 days after I bought it and went back to my Sidekick. And by the way, the excitement of it being ""magenta"" (which it really does look like the color they show if you buy from T-mobile)...wears off about 24hrs after having it!!"
1,HATED IT,"I actually went through three of these phones. Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player. I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone.... p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his!"
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to get my first ""cool"" phone. . .I've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr, I knew I wanted one. I saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.I have only had this phone for a month, but I am horribly disappointed. It has horrible reception (and I know it's not the network because I tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls. It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever. I went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new Samsung, but I'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations. :("
1,DO NOT BUY,This Phone looks appealing but the features are not at all. This phone is for someone who just wants to call and text. I bought this phone about the end of febuary. The camera quality is not good it looks too grey even when you adjust the settings. The video only records like 10(ten) seconds not good if you are trying to record a kodak moment :). The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally. The phone screen cracks easily i dropped mine closed and the liquid started coming out so i had to get a new one. ONLY buy this phone if you are only trying to text or call out. I DONT recommend this for a kid or someone who likes to have fun. Im thinking about getting the slvr but they say it sucks too so im not sure. BYE BYE! :)
3,It's not that pink!,It may look very pink in the pic but I saw one at our local cingular store and it is mauve noy hot pink! If your okay with mauve it's a great phone...I love my black one!
3,Are you a Titan man?,"This is a story about a man talked into living a wild party lifestyle based on Titan Magazine. The main characters were Steve who upward bound in his career but naive and Carol who was Steve's bitter ex from college who caught him cheating. The plus is it's a good storyline. The minuses are it's predictable, too much cursing, and dry humor. The book was hard to put down because even though it is predictable it does has some graphic sex scenes which are well done."
1,Is there a point to this???????????,Try as I might I could just not get into this book nor force myself to finish it.
1,waste of time!,"Don't bother reading something a high school student could have easily surpassed in style, character development and most importantly, content!! Compared to books of many renowned MAINSTREAM authors this deserves a MINUS 10 rating (actually, I wonder why it was ever published!)"
1,What's the point?,"The pages of this biik hardly contain anything new, in fact, it is all quite trite and not really worth the money. I would like to suggest ""God Calling"" instead of this."
5,And that is enough,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a beautiful book. It's an easy read, but that doesn't mean that it isn't memorable and fascinating. I believe that everyone could relate to this book in some sense. It truly is wonderful."
5,Simply amazing.,The love I feel for this book cannot be expressed in words. It's just wonderful. The best book I've ever read.
4,More than a clever name,I thought that this would be a light book but found that there were topics that shock although teens might experience or discuss these things in their lives. There is a sense of sad hopefulness that makes me ask why?
2,Nothing special,A book for young readers. I wish I had purchased something else. It's one of those reads which leaves you expressionless after reading the book.
4,a generation's voice,"I read The Perks Of Being a Wallflower expecting a reincarnation of an overused coming of age formula. I was pleasantly relieved. Chbosky certainly summoned the tradition of Holden Caufield in Charlie but created a modern portrait that has reinvigorated the genre. Charlie, like Caufield, lacks the adolescent spirit of complascency and instead allows his mind to ponder truth where there are only lies. Charlie has his friends, who have clearly lived the same hell, to guide him through the gauntlet of acceptance, understanding and presence. Charlie's age is inconsequential. And while his experiences are hardly universal, he seeks and finds (most of) the answers that subconsciously trouble a generation. Charlie seeks the answers to the questions most of us will not ask. Chbosky has personified the voice of our generation."
5,A Beautiful Book,"An extraordinary work -- ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is one of the best books I've read in a long time and deserves all the positive reviews it has received. Essential reading for those who remember starting high school, finding new friends, discovering love, and basically, being confused about it all."
3,Good Read,This book was a fun tale that made me flashback to my high school days. I enjoyed reading it :)
5,Journey of a book,"I had no idea what to expect but with a movie coming out I had to read this book. So glad I did. I couldn't explain how it made me feel but it made me feel a lot. It is such a small and simple book with so much going on it kind of surprises you. This wil definitely be a reread on day,"
5,Great Book,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loved the story. I bought it in hardback because that is what she likes to hold and read..
4,Good Read,It is wonderful to read Charlie's words through his innocence. The portrayal of his mind gives you a picture of how someone can be locked in trauma without being able to see.
5,Wallflower,Such an inspiring and amazing book. It was cool how things came together in the end. Very sweet story I will probably end up reading it again
5,Infinite,"Wonderfully written, and a read like nothing else. The pure emotion Chbosky used was the spine, brain and heart of the novel."
4,So far I love it,I'm only half way through but I've gotten to the point where I can't wait to find out what happens next. I'm excited to finish it.
5,Great Book,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a wonderful book! Ive read it twice within 1 year and it's my favorite. I don't read books often, but when I read this, I loved it. It's probably good for people ages 13 and up. Expecially for highschoolers. Charlie is a great character who makes his life through school, growing up, meeting girls and so on. It seems like you know him from the begining. You don't have to think twice about this book. Go buy it and enjoy!"
4,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Couldn't put this down. A must read for all 90's kids. Charlie is all of us at some point of our teenage years.
5,Perks of being a wallflower,"This was a great book!!!!! It was just really really such a great book, I loved it a lot !!"
3,"Good book, now that I finished it","This book was well-written, but a little slow for me. I didn't identify with the narrator, which was probably why I didn't get into it."
4,Finished in one sitting,"This book was great! I read it from start to finish in about 4 hours. I loved Charlie as a character, and several times imagined myself smoking a cigarette with these kids. Damn Aunt Helen."
2,Awesome,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!Fantastic!<3 it's beyond perfect and this movie is the most amazing movie ever <3 PERFECTION
3,The Perks Huh...,Hmmm... might have missed the point. Have to read again. Overall it was a very cool book. Charlie is just really weird.
4,Book,Very good. Kind of a deep story which taught a lot of good lessons to me while reading this book
3,Overrated,"I heard great reviews about this book , however after reading it I felt empty and wished for more substance. This particular book was highly overrated ! I discommend to any reader looking for a deeper reading experience."
4,:),I really enjoy the structure of the book. I like that it is written In letters and I'm ready to watch the movie now
3,Perspective,"At times the book seemed to bore me but I would keep reading. It has amazing quotes to take away and it really makes you feel. Feel normal, feel blessed. I'd recommend this book for all ages."
3,Ok,This book wasn't like I thought it would be! It was good but not great in my opinion. Onto the next
5,My life,This book related to mine and my best friends life so well and I'll tell all of my friends to read it. It is very inspirational and I bet it will help me and other people through a lot
3,The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky,"This story is delivered through a series of letters from a boy named Charlie. He never reveals to whom he is writing or if the person got any of his letters.Charlie takes you on a emotional rollercoaster of love, hate, and sadness. He vividly depicts his freshman year of high school and the world around him. He is sort of a lonely guy, but when he meets two seniors, Sam and Patrick, he finally feels as though he belongs.This book is amazing and inspiring. Charlie explains high school with brutal honesty, all of the gentle and sugarcoated events thrown out of the window.I do not recommend this book to the faint hearted or anyone who shies away from true high school parties and what events may happen at them.I loved it and I hope you will too."
4,Good story,Not usually what I would read but I enjoyed it. It really makes you think about life. Everyone should read it.
5,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"This book is entertaining, exciting, and truthful. It kept me interested for hours, and it has a lot of memorable quotes. The letter form is new and original, especially since it is unknown who Charlie is writing to. There are some parts where nothing much is happening, but they're still interesting simply because of the way Charlie tells it. I'd recommend this book to anyone who asked."
3,Really Quirky,I kept reading this=and debated several times about not finishing it. This poor fellow was a misfit; it seemed he kept associating with other misfits whether he wanted to or not. I was surprised at his freedom to come and go from his home and often wondered about his lack of parental guidance.
3,Wallflower,It was a pretty good book but I must say I liked the movie better even though the book did have a couple better things.
2,Okay,Wasn't fantastic. That's all I have to say about it and I think it's stupid that you require so many words for a review. The first amount of words I choose to write should be up to me
4,Loved it,Couldn't put it down! It was a book full of life's biggest truths and I could deeply relate. Must read.
5,Fantastic!,"This book was great, I couldn't put it down. Very relatable to teens and young adults. Great read, definitely recommend"
4,Makes you think,"Remember high school? Weather it was you that blended into the wall, or someone else, we all knew a wallflower. This book makes you think. Makes you question the main character's sense of reality right til the end. I found myself laughing, and sometimes I felt a pit in my stomach. Definitely worth the read. Just a though, while reading, really take time to remember things taking place, it will make it easier at the end of the book."
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read! I bought it today, about 6 hours ago, and I am already done with it. The book is endearing, moving, and honest. I am a 17-year old male and I could definitely relate to the feelings of Charlie. This book was so touching. I started to cry while reading it because some of the feelings of Charlie are ones that I have experienced in my own life. It is rare that I am touched so much by a book. I would recommend this to anyone, but mostly teenagers because it really captures the essence of growing up."
5,A Great One,"This haunting novel is about the dilemma of passivity and growing up. The protagonist, Charlie, is entering a new world. He's entering high school for the first time and he learns about who he is to the rest of the world. Charlie is a wallflower. He's different from everyone else and he shares his feelings and thoughts to us through letters. This book is more intimate than a diary, though we don't know where Charlie lives, or who he's writing to. Charlie goes through uncharted territory, living his life and running from it all at the same time. It's a great coming-of-age story. It shows the hardships and trials of growing up in life, and competing to fit in. This novel demonstrates what it's like to grow up through a teenager's mind. Along with THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, this is one of the best books I've read in ages."
4,Worthwhile!,"I'd been told that this book was similar to The Catcher in the Rye, and it is on some levels. It's structured as a series of letters from the main character (Charlie) to an unknown recipient. Charlie is a delightful main character...introspective, sensitive, insightful, and never angsty (this is the big difference from Catcher). Chbosky tackles pretty much every issue that a teen could possibly face...drugs, alcohol, love, loss, you name it. While I didn't find it to be the most original book, I loved the writing style and there were a ton of great quotes. As a plus for book lovers Charlie reads a good number of well-loved classics and gives his opinions on them as he relates them to his life. Some of the titles include The Fountainhead, The Catcher in the Rye, The Stranger, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Overall very touching and engrossing."
3,likeable main character but a little wishy washy,"I picked up this book in the ""Literature"" section at my bookstore and did not realize that it was a young adult book until about half way through the novel. I graduated high school in 1988 so I could relate to a lot of the cultural references throughout the book (set in 1991-1992). Charlie is a guy that you really want to like and for the most part you will. The main problem in my opinion was that the book sort of read like a TV movie about a dysfunctional teenager you might see on any network channel."
2,The Catcher in the Wallflower,"I wanted to like this, I did- it's one of the original YA book! But the borrowing from The Catcher in the Rye was just too much for me. And before you protest that it's original (and there are some differences- that's why I was able to give it 2 stars) let's take a look at some similarities:- Both are well-read- Both end with the main character going to a mental facility- Both rely on teachers as mentors (and both visit their homes)- Both protagonists are very intelligent- Both have trouble making new friends- Both are very affected by dead family member- Both are self-aware (they know that they are struggling)- Both have similar syntax- Both have experimentation with alcohol/drugs- Both are intimidated by sex- Both are respectful of women- Both are from the first person narratives- Both value sibingsDrop mic."
5,A wonderful interpretation of the modern-day teenager's life,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a wonderful interpretation of the modern-day teenager that reflects the different types of things that todays teenagers go through. Charlie was such a relatable character and made the whole novel seem like Charlie was one of todays teenagers. This book was so good, it is now my favorite novel of all time."
5,very good,"This book was a very good book and i cried quite a lot throughout the book. the whole story line was what i thought was so great. what made me get the book was the movie preview and i don't really understand how the producers will make this into a pg-13 movie, but ok."
4,vivid characters,Enjoyed read in one day I now want to read all the books charlie read I also want to date sam.
5,21st Century Coming of Age,"Destined to be a classic. Coming of age, poignant, study of style, reference to music and other important literature, social themes, family dynamics, self-image, relationships--the novel covers it all. It made me reflect on my high school years and my children's. I also projected forward to my grand children's. This novel deserves to be discussed by people who enjoy writing and the reasons people act and think they way they do."
5,Awesome,This is such a awesome book. It does have some mature scenes but i would recommend this boom to a lot of people
4,Refreshing,"It is thoroughly refreshing to finally see a book with meaning being written for the teens/adults of today. Charlie is your normal outcast. No friends, smart, a strange family. His best friend from 8th grade killed himself, his best friend's girlfriend hates him, and now is going around with every guy in school. Charlie's only sanctuary is with the duo Patrick and Sam. Two pot-smoking, acid-dropping teens on their way to college. Between Patrick and Sam and Charlie's English teacher he'll be able to survive high school and life, but not without challenges along the way.This is an interesting coming of age story and a must read for anyone who feels like they're a wallflower."
3,"Good, but...","This book had a great storyline and I liked how thoughtful Charlie was, but the way he writes got a little annoying. Like a 10 year old was writing, not a 16 year old."
4,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Interesting look into the mind of a teenager. I liked the letter format. Not sure why there were sections to the book.
5,Could not put it down,This book was an amazing read. The way it touched on the life of this kid was amazing. I am recommending it to everyone.
5,amazing,"this is an amazing coming of age book. It is short, around 200 pages or so, but boy does it pack in personality. You fall in love with the characters immediately and can identify with them as well. I would suggest this as a read to any teenager going through a rough time in high school. Although I read it when I was 22, and still loved it. Can't wait for the movie!"
3,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"This book to me seems moderately interesting and moderately well written. It would probably appeal more to much younger readers than I, which may help explain why I wasn't especially moved by it. I read it because a woman, perhaps in her late 20's, had been reading it and described its content to me in general terms, and seemed quite enthusiastic about it. So I thought that by reading it I'd get more insight about her generation's interests."
4,I really liked it,I like the way the story is told through letters written by Charlie and how we only see things from his perspective. And I loved all of the songs and music references in the book - the mix tapes really took me back. Perks tells a familiar story but not in a cliche way. It is really thoughtful.
3,"Easy read, depressing content","I bought the book and then went to see the movie in theaters. The book was an easy read and kept me well engaged. However, I found the content to be depressing. One thing after another, each and every one of Charlie's letters has something disturbing and depressing about it... suicide, homosexuality, bullying, abuse, abortion... it's all in there. The movie wasn't much better, but isn't that generally the case that the book happens to be better. There were a few very moving moments in the movie, but overall, just another cheesy hollywood adaptation."
3,Predictable,"Not bad, but I wouldn't read it again. I read the book b/c the movie was coming out. However, I was slightly disappointed. It was very predictable and had some monotonous sections. That said, it was an easy read, I was done in a day."
5,Title,The perks of being a wallflower is a really good book. Quick read and enjoyable. You start to really love the characters. I recommend to any ages.
3,"Liked it, but a bit disturbing","I liked this book to probably read it a second time, but with more caution than the first time I read it in knowing what the ending is like. I found it somewhat implausible that this outcast kid would find a ""home"" with a group of much older teenagers than himself, and even date one of them; especially because he was more or less a bumbling fool who occasionally said insightful things but mostly seemed like a zombie who cried too much.That said, I recommend it, but not if you are looking for a standard happy ending. I was somewhat depressed and unsettled when I finished it. I don't want to say more lest I give away key plot points, but I felt like it cut off rather abruptly and left me with questions."
3,"great title, okay story","I originally chose to read this book because of the title. I thought that it might be a funny book. But in reality, I read this book and it made me so depressed. I really liked Patrick; he was the only character in the book that I really cared about at all. The ending was surprising but it explained a lot of things about Charlie's personality. Some of the events in the story didn't make sense when you thought about what Charlie's personality was like. I liked Charlie though. He was sweet."
3,just a boring journal,"Sorry, I just don't think the book is that remarkable. It's basically just a teenager's diary. You can guess the big secret long before it is revealed."
4,Loved it!,It was an interesting story line full of hope and adolescents confusion and it was just a good coming of age story. I really enjoyed it.
4,Great read!,The perks of being a wallflower was a very easy yet interesting read! I couldn't stop reading once I started.
4,Great book,Quick easy read. I enjoyed it very much. I also liked the way the book was written in letters. Check it out
3,Overrated.,"I kept hearing for years about what a wonderful book this was. But when I finally bought it I was sorely disappointed. It's not a terrible book, or even a mediocre book, just sort of average. It didn't live up to the hype. Worth reading but not worth buying. If you really want this book, I suggest you get it from a library."
5,Rarely do I find a book like this...,"Besides ""Thirteen Reasons Why"" by Jay Asher, I have never read a book so difficult to read(in a good way). It was so honest, and brought me to near tears more than once. I felt like I knew what Charlie was feeling, and several times I had to set down the book so that I could relax enough to continue reading. It was absorbing, full of good music and books. It also reminded me of ""Looking for Alaska"" by John Green. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. It upset me so much, but it also made me feel infinite."
3,Interesting,"The book was very different from what I was expecting, which was a ""teenager"" book. However, that made it intriguing and kept me reading."
3,Eh...,"Saw the reviews and expected sheer awesomeness, but it kinda seemed like something you'd read while on drugs... Not a whole lot of it made sense, and I kept expecting to have a critical question answered, but the book never resolves it. Having said that, there are some great quotes in there, and I did feel like I was on Cloud Nine as I read them. Not sure I can say I really liked it, though, bottom line."
4,HEADLINE,"This book is a pretty decent read. It's light, but still immersive. It doesn't have a strange twist or over-the-top conclusion. It satisfies at a basic level to a very high standard."
4,"Easy, entertaining read",This was a great book for casual reading. For a shorter book it went into great depth with the characters and had a good mix of humor and seriousness. Definitely worth reading
5,This book was amazing!!!!!!!,"I admit I wanted to read this book after I saw the preview of the movie. I like Emma Watson a lot and she has good taste in movies I think. Anyways, I recently bought this book and had it read in five days, it would have been sooner except I'm back in school and that takes up most all of my time. Without it I would have been done in a day or maybe two. I highly recommend you read this book. It was cleverly written since each chapter is actually a letter that Charlie is writing to someone unknown about what is happening in his life. You feel for the kid you really do. I can see why Emma Watson wanted to do this movie. I can't wait to see the adaptation and how these actors portray them. Should be good since the writer of the book is also producing and directing the movie as well.If you want a quick read and a good one at that, I would hands down recommend this one!! You won't regret it. Then you'll also want to see the movie too I bet. lol. Just a prediction of mine."
